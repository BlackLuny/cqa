Per theism, an agnostic theist believes that the proposition at least one deity exists is true, but, per agnosticism, believes that the existence of gods are unknown or inherently unknowable. The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god(s) they believe in. [1]<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Views of agnostic theism <br>  2 See also <br>  3 References <br>  4 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Views of agnostic theism<br>   <br>  Agnostic theism is Belief but without Knowledge, as shown in purple and blue(see: Epistemology).There are numerous beliefs that can be included in agnostic theism, including Fideism, however not all agnostic theists are Fideists. It is possible to be a Christian agnostic, an Islamic agnostic, a Zoroastrian agnostic or simply an agnostic, non-religious theist. Since agnosticism does not forbid belief in a deity, it is compatible with most theistic positions.<br>  <br>  The classical philosophical understanding of knowledge is that knowledge is justified true belief. By this definition, it is reasonable to assert that one may hold a belief, and that belief may be true, without asserting that one knows it. Agnostic theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one's belief in a god sufficiently for it to be considered known. This may be because they consider faith a requirement of their religion, or because of the influence of plausible-seeming scientific or philosophical criticism.<br>  <br>  The following argument is used[citation needed] to justify Fideism within the context of Christianity:<br>  <br>  Christian theology teaches that people are saved by faith in God (i.e., trust in the empirically unprovable). <br>  But, if God's existence can be proven, either empirically or logically, to that extent faith becomes unnecessary or irrelevant. <br>  Therefore, if Christian theology is true, no immediate proof of God's existence is possible. <br>  Christian Agnostics (distinct from Christian agnostics) practice a distinct form of agnosticism that applies only to the properties of God. They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the Christian faith; that God exists, that Jesus has a special relationship with him and is in some way divine, that God should be worshipped and that humans should be compassionate toward one another. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_theism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_th...</a>|`|2UuEQLcfaa	being agnostic isn't a religion. an agnostic does not follow mainstream religion but does admit the possibility of a higher power. and athiest rejects religion all together.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God.<br>  One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.<br>  One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Agnostic is not a religion.

It is a covenant. A contract between God and man. God signed that covenant in blood.All we have to do is accept it in the heart and confess Jesus with our mouth.Religions takes this covenant and turns it into rituals and wrong thinking. Not knowing that covenant and the promises God made causes people to do things that they think are spiritual, but are not.<br>      Religious people are the main ones that gave Jesus any trouble.Just like today, religions make God's word have no effect on them. They let homo's be bishops. Their people get sick like the world and never give promises to overcome the sickness.They actually take vows of poverty. God says in 111John 2," I wish above ALL things you prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.That mes entered Christianity some 300 years after the day of pentecost. It came through eastern religions, and it came through the gentiles. You cannot get the descendants of Abraham, Jews,to believe that nonsense.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	God doesn't like people worshiping false gods and stone idols, he doesn't like sin, he doesn't like hypocrites, false prophets and preachers of bad doctrines, but I can't see why he would have a problem with a right religion practiced correctly.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Don't know exactly but there are references in the bible to Jesus disliking religion and the concepts of christians despising other faiths.
INJSpV4haa	I think people in general have less of a bias against girls or women barefoot in public, than guys out barefoot in public. I think this has to do with the fact that so many women's shoes (probably most women's shoes) have a tendency to be very revealing, and open-toed, so people are used to seeing female bare feet already (albeit in some strappy sandal or flip flops). <br>  <br>  In contrast the vast majority of men's shoes are closed, therefore seeing male feet barefoot tend to freak most people out.<br>  <br>  It's a very strange reaction. I don't get the foot phobia thing.|`|fQi9opseaa	i think women just do it more. Not necessarily more accepted.<br>  I think cuz men where running shoes a lot and women wear shoes that are easier to take off. thts not always true though.|`|C0TL8d2Gaa	No, of course not, men can go barefoot anywhere, just like women! :)|`|jpH4IjWnaa	No, not at all. It's acceptable for both genders equally.|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	I think it's in the process of equalizing somewhat, at least in terms of being common.  Being accepted will go on a close track to being common, probably leading or following by some small margin.<br>  <br>  Certainly many more women than men wear shoes that are designed to be worn without socks.  And, while there was an era in history when platform heels and long pointy toes were prominent in men's footwear among royal society as symbols of status or prowess, women's feet have been crammed into shoes that can't be doing them any good for millenia.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, I read a letter to an advice columnist that illustrates my point.  The writer, who mentioned that she and her husband entertained often, was in a state of some annoyance with party guests who removed their shoes without her asking them to do so.  The columnist admitted to never having been bothered when a guest removed her shoes, adding that she had never seen a male guest do so, because women's shoes were often so painful to keep on.  While women have become more concerned about comfort and health, fashion still lures them to shoes that make their feet appear smaller and their lines more elegant.<br>  <br>  There are also still vestiges of connections between bare feet and low social status or power that apply slightly more to men than women, although that too is equalizing as women approach parity in government and other important institutions.  For social status, regard The Waltons, the television drama set during the Great Depression of the 1930's and running through World War II.  For about 2-3 seasons, the young Waltons and many of their friends were usually barefooted in situations where footwear was optional.  Then for another 2-3 seasons it was occasional.  After five or six seasons, bare feet sightings became quite rare.  Some people thought that this was a result of a campaign by concerned parents who didn't want their children to emulate what they saw on television, but there were some clues in the series itself that it also reflected the gradual improvement in the family's financial status.<br>  <br>  On the power front, the subversive quality of the image of the Barefoot Executive is still more potent with a male.  There was a televison film a few years ago which got this sort of point across really quickly in a short scene.  A young corporate type, who clearly was the sort who followed all the Career Guidelines one sees in the employment section of the newspaper, waited for an interview in the conference room of a new fast-rising computer company.  The head of the company entered in casual wear and conducted the interview with his bare feet propped up on the conference table.  The shock and discomfort of the applicant made it obvious that, no matter how good his qualifications, he wasn't going to be working there.

9m2LvlWdaa	Well I would imagine so.|`|7cLYgf2raa	Imagination is producing an image in our minds.We see wih our minds also.Words are carriers of imaginations. We speak words to convey one image to another person.If I say, " dog" that will produce an image in you.But it will be vague. If I say " big, black , three-legged dog, " now I have a more complete image of what is in my mind and have conveyed this image to you. God had an image of Jesus and his ministry in his mind. He would heal the sick, raise the dead, a virgin birth. He spoke for 4,000 years about Jesus coming. He was creating an image on the inside of himself. When that imagination was complete, it became flesh and dwelt among men.<br>        We speak the words of Jesus, and if it is recieved in the heart, that image is born in that person's heart and they are reborn from death to life.<br>       Now if a person puts death and sin images in their heart, that is what they become.You can always tell what imaginations are in a person's heart by the words they speak.

UxooffHZaa	I use the title Pagan. For me, a Pagan is someone who's God (or Gods, as there are more polytheistic pagans, than monotheistic, or even nontheistic ones) isn't bound by the writings of any one tribe. (i.e. the Bible doesn't say what God actually does, and he's therefore not bound by it) God can be better read in the snow falling on a cold Oak tree in February, or the improvised dance of a toddler then in any book, no matter how cunningly writ. <br>  I also believe in magic as a psychological practice. For me, specifically ritual and sigil creation in the AO Spare method. I also believe we're a part of nature (animals ourselves, the logical animal, just as Cobras are the poisonous animal and Robins are the flying animal etc) and can do well to celebrate the rituals associated with changing weather, and the beauty of God's great creation, Earth. <br>  Finally, many Pagans are into Astrology, and I'm just not. I like Astronomy though, and will fight for there to be the 11 planets in the solar system, instead of the 8 small-minded Astrophysicists today say there are. After all, Terra has debris in her path as well as do Eris, Ceres and Pluto.|`|283tO9j9aa	Paganism isn't just one religion- it's many. The most famous religion that gets classed as pagan rather than a religion in its own right is Wicca. Some Pagans worship the Greek, Roman, Norse or Egyptian gods, others worship none or feel there is just a sort of presence in everything (pantheism). As much as there are different Pagan religions, there are also lots of Pagans who have their own individual beliefs that don't quite fit in anywhere but take aspects from different places.<br>  <br>  I am not a Pagan, but I know a few people who are. It isn't just 14 year old Wiccans either, as some people insist- I know someone who is in her 50s and is a practicing Pagan... I think she is also Wiccan actually. They're really nice people.|`|C2h2f4cdaa	As I understand, Christians used the word Pagan to describe all non-Christian beliefs and spiritual practices.<br>  <br>  Check out the link for more info:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism</a>|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Thanks for repeating the word Pagan six different times in three sentences.|`|Mwhclezaaa	Technically any non-christian is a pagan, although some people call themselves pagan as a sort of religion in itself, similar to celtic or wiccan religions.|`|28TJbbNHaa	Paganism is an umbrella term for non-Christian religions.|`|AA10493307	They participate in pagan celebrations such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Valentine Day, etc.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	Whats meant by Paganism is mostly the worship of the old european Gods like Thor, Odin or Freya.<br>  <br>  Though the word can also be used to describe any non-abrahamic religion like the aztec or hindu gods.
rj5FE3Klaa	I don't know about guys that have sex with anything that walks or not caring about someone being naked but definitely I'd say that a big percentage of guys on the planet play with themselves on their palms. <br>  <br>  I myself like a pretty girl and a cute/beautiful and sweet face. Nice body good too. I do care about things but depends on what things. If she's naked that's fine too. <br>  <br>  Yea some girls can be pigs too but they are like ninjas if you don't personally know the girl.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Yeah, it's just a stereotype.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	well yes, women can be pigs too.  But what's truly offensive about it is the suggestion that we care only about sex.  Hey we enjoy that stuff, but that's not all there is to life.|`|5VmXqN6zaa	I am male, and I am ideologically opposed to lustful behaviors. But from my observation, there are more perverted men than women.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	I watch porn and play with myself all the time..AND have a lot of sex with my bf. I'm a horny toad..but only with ONE guy at a time.|`|0mXQODsIaa	yeah your right, i never watch porn, i dont masturbate or anything. and im a 15 year old male. some guys just make us seem like that sadly. but im actualy very nice and caring. and no im not gay|`|AA12212224	Yea, that's the public perception, the stereotype. And there are always exceptions. Maybe it's even the ideal expectation of men.<br>  <br>  I guess it can be considered unfair, but I don't consider it a problem unless someone is judging another with prejudice. I don't have sex with everything that walks or have no interest in what girls say*  but I don't hold it against anyone if they think I do. I would though, if they continue to treat me like I did even after talking to me and it becomes apparent I'm not like that, hahaha.<br>  <br>  But hey, boys are stupid, throw rocks at them.<br>  <br>  *Honestly sometimes I space out and don't pay perfect attention and just nod and Uh huh. But I do this when I talk to other guys sometimes too.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	Yes it is unfair that some people generalize males to be a certain way. It also is unfair to generalize females to be a certain way. The world is an unfair place and there are "pigs" everywhere you go, but seriously that doesn't mean that you should promote being a "pig". I'm sure that you would not have said such a thing in front of all your friends, but I don't care how many thumbs down I get. All this perverseness shouldn't be promoted like it's a cool or normal thing.|`|jCjoKRHCaa	you are so right  but on the other hand generally speaking it is true  i live with 4 guys and they are constantly checking out the girls walking by our house   i mean religiously<br>  i dont see girls beghaving like that unless they are 12|`|836vtf9Saa	im not a girl so i have no say in this
7aueTuAXaa	Find a group that is going on a mission trip and working towards raising the funds.  Lots of churches sponsor groups on mission trips and then help them to raise the funds to go.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	the cost will be most likely the travel. There is really not too much point in paying you the money for the airfare ticket as organizations which are looking for volunteers tend to have no spare money. The money spent for your air fare could instead pay for a well or hospital equipment.<br>  <br>  You can volunteer in your community for free as much as you want. If you want to go abroad for free you will have to look for scholarships or for paid work.
0fRsWy05aa	Yes. He has full custody.  I believe he paid his nurse to have children with him. Debbie gave up her parental right for the money. Regardless if they not his biological children or not.  He's has raise them and MJ is their legal father. I can only assume Debbie does see them. I can't image any mother not wanting to see her children. @~|`|FKxrJxbPaa	theyre definitely not his kids though....how is it that a Black man has NO visibly black children? All of his kids are blonde, blue-eyed and very pale.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I seriously doubt he is even biologically their dad. From what I have seen they all have fair skin and blond hair/blue eyes. He used to be black before he lost his mind sooooooo how can those kids be his? Bleaching yourself won't give you alabaster babies! And no the mother never sees them, she was on a talk show one night saying how it was a business arrangement from the beginning. They didn't even have sex, it was all artificial. I hope those kids are robots though and not actual children being subjected to that freak show!|`|9lL6njWAaa	Haha, you don't seriously believe those r realli his kids do you?? Why should he get custody of kids that aren't even his, when he's not fit to look after himself?|`|VEgv5NhSaa	I don't think so cuz look, this is the best i could find sorry:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&vid=d877c8da-78df-4f48-9399-677553231fac&from=rss34" rel="nofollow">http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&vid=d877...</a>|`|yDmLWsd9aa	Yes.

AA12352139	I am Pro-Capital Punishment; I believe it is 100 percent effective as a deterrent for murders. No one who has been executed has been able to re-offend! However, all channels of the law MUST BE exhausted to make sure that the right perpetrator is being executed. Let's be realistic, there are criminals out there who don't care about other people's lives and kill with impunity and without caring about the consequences. Why should we care about their lives. They make a mockery of our laws and exploit it to their advantage.<br>  <br>  I am neither firmly Pro-Life nor Pro-Choice because I think each case should be judged on its own merit. I don't think abortion should be used as a form of birth control. I beleive life starts at conception not birth - I dare you to argue otherwise to a long-aspiring mother who loses her pregnancy mid-term. At the same time, parents should be able to decide to keep or terminate a prenancy which will result in the birth of a child with serious defects or with no prospect of a full life.|`|283tO9j9aa	I feel that a fetus is not conscious and independent, whereas a prisoner on death row is both and has a lifetime of memories and relationships with other humans. For the fetus, life as a person hasn't really started yet as it is not aware- I understand that a small baby isn't either, but a baby outside the womb is also capable of sustaining its own breathing, digestion and circulation.<br>  <br>  I am only pro-choice up to the point where the fetus is viable outside the womb- in the Western world this is approximately 24 weeks gestation onwards. At that point I feel that unless there is a medical emergency, the fetus is developed enough that it probably feels pain and so it would cause unnecessary suffering- I read somewhere that nerve endings in the fetus mature between 22 and 28 weeks.<br>  <br>  Another reason to disagree with the death penalty is that it's possible to kill an innocent person. If someone has done nothing wrong and you kill them because you think they're guilty, it could turn out later on that you got it wrong. You can't bring that person back. If they were just in prison, you could let them out. I do think that a life sentence should actually mean life though.<br>  <br>  I understand that people will respond to that with 'but a fetus is innocent'. I see it like this: the prisoner is a person who has led their life in the world. They have friends and family who have loved them for many years. A fetus is a potential person and not an actual person yet.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i am pro-choice and anti-death penalty because killing the murderer is counter-productive. it's not going to bring the victims back, and it's letting the murderer off easy. he should rot in solitary confinement living on bread and water. however, abortion and the death penalty are not related whatsoever.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	I am Pro-Choice and Anti-Capital Punishment, and here is how it makes sense to me:<br>  <br>  Captial punishment is killing a person. Therefore it is murder.<br>  <br>  Abortion is not killing a person. Life begins at birth. A fetus cannot survive outside the womb, and is therefore not alive. Abortion is disposing of an egg/fetus before it has matured and therefore, it is not murder.<br>  <br>  For those who are Pro-Life and Pro-Capital Punishment, I believe their philosophy is that everyone deserves a chance at life - even the unborn - but if someone screws that chance up (by committing a heinous crime) - then they no longer deserve to live.|`|s4FEJiNHaa	yes thank u!  I've been saying this for years and it's nice to see that somebody actually does think the same way.  Liberals and conservatives r both hypocritical in this way.  I say pick one: everybody lives or everybody dies.  Make up ur minds.  Me: prochoice and pro death penalty.|`|AA10329469	Let's not confuse the issues.Abortion is not equivalent of death sentence and conditions for their execution are vastly different.It would all depend or vary from case to case.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	I'm pro-choice although I think it's sickening when women abort 4 month old babies for no reason. HOWEVER, MOST WOMEN HAVE HAD ABORTIONS. It's part of life and it ain't pretty. God doesn't hate us for it and it truly is different when your in those pair of shoes..therefore, I don't think we can punish ALL women just because some abort babies left and right like it's a joke.<br>  I'm also PRO-capital punishment...ONLY if the person is proved guilty beyond a doubt...and it's a severely heinous crime.

SBL1t3ZSaa	Most religions and most people that believe in God regardless of what they call him or their personal beliefs believe that God will judge each and every person on what kind of life they have lived, however with that being said, Most Christians on the other hand believe that only the people who accept Jesus as God, the son of God, the Messiah and your lord and savior that became God in the flesh so he could suffer and die so that your sin could be forgiven will be the only people that are *saved* from the eternal fires of hell for all eternity.<br>  <br>  My personal belief is that there is a God and if you try your very best to live a good and descent life, doing no harm to others and above all not worshiping anything other than God, be it another person, a rock or a tree, I believe that is what God really wants from all of us humans.<br>  <br>  I don't belong to any religion, I was raised in the Catholic/Christian faith and it took me many years to find what I believe it is that God expects from me. I hold no Catholic or Christian beliefs I worship no man or anything else, I only worship God and along with his 10 Commandants I follow the Laws God gave to all mankind after the great flood (The Laws Of Noah). <br>  <br>  I am a Noahide.<br>  <br>  1) Do not murder.<br>  2) Do not steal.<br>  3) Do not worship false gods.<br>  4) Do not be sexually immoral.<br>  5) Do not eat the limb of an animal before it is killed.<br>  6) Do not curse God.<br>  7) Set up courts and bring offenders to justice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.org/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.com/7" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.com/7</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/s..." rel="nofollow">http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/s...</a>|`|GF8VLkxDaa	The way to salvation is full submission to the will of God, and taking full responsibility of your actions, but believing in God's mercy:)<br>  <br>  Islam is concrete on this.

You NEED TO BELIEVE that Jesus is real and that He rose back to life and is now in heaven with God, and only through accepting what He has done for us and letting him take control of our lives we can be saved ie not be held accountable for our past sins and able to have a relationship with Him. You NEED TO BELIEVE that Jesus is coming back and believers will live with Him for eternity. Old testament scholars have calculated roughly how old the earth is through the genealogies listed and comes to be about 6,000. Things that you can take metaphorically are the parables and illustrations, visions and dreams that have an explanation of what is to happen or what these things me - the rest of it - such as the stories about Abraham, Moses, Noah, King David, Jesus, Paul etc are all real stories not symbols that are meant to tell you a different story. hope this helps|`|4sUek7ugaa	That's what's really funny about Christianity.

I do not believe children and those with mental handicaps are capable of sin, I do not believe that those who have never been exposed to the Torah, Bible or Quran are doomed for hell. I believe God is the only one who can really judge anybody, so who would I be to claim that because a person does not think like me, they are going to be punished for it? I am not divine.

hzMpdFFBaa	A wizard is another name for a mage or a sorcerer and may be more of a description for someone who practices ceremonial magic. <br>  <br>  A warlock is sometimes understood to be a male witch and some male witches may call themselves warlocks, but it is  considered by some in the Craft to be a perjorative term, meaning a traitor or deceiver who is an outcast to the Craft. Both witch and warlock were perjorative terms until about the 1950s with the revivial of western folk magic and neopaganism.  Although people practiced folk magic/shamanism  since the beginning of time (and European witchcraft is a form of Old World shamanism), they usually didn't call themselves witches or warlocks--other people--outsiders/the Church--called them these things.  On the other hand, people involved in ceremonial magic, "high magic," hermetic  western occultism, and esoteric secret societies were apt to call themselves wizards and mages. The men I know who practice Wicca or witchcraft call themselves witches.  The men I know who practice ceremonial or post-modern magic/sorcery, call themselves magicians. <br>  <br>  In literature and sci fi/fantasy, the rules and nomenclature are whatever the author/creator wants them to be.|`|wM7pprr1aa	A "Wizard" learns his/her craft from years of studying grimoires and memorizing spellforms and the complex geometry of arcane symbology.

A synonym is sorcerer.<br>  <br>  I do believe there is a difference, but the encyclopedia is not being that specific. <br>  <br>  I do not consider these things "evil".

It can be used for someone who does magic, or someone who is great at a specific subject; i.e. That guy is a Wizard on the Violin, or she's a Wizard at Physics. <br>  The term Warlock is derived however from more negative connotations connected with magic. (deceiver, etc) In this way, it's closer to the term Witch, reclaimed by Wiccans in the European Witchcraft movement. (20th Century) Some magic people have reclaimed the word Warlock (Richard Metzger is a famous example) just as have their Witch counterparts. But, in some communities, it's still a no-no, just like the N-Word is unacceptable in most American social circles, though some specific subsets have reclaimed that word too.|`|AA10556726	Depends on what magic system you are using.

XDDEvFQXaa	I find to this question you are going to get two answers.  You are going to get answers from people who believe that being a homosexual is a sin that is going to condemn you to Hell, and then you are going to have others who believe that Love is what it truly boils down to.  <br>  <br>  I am on the fence...<br>  <br>  I am on the fence because I have grown up as a Christian who is also gay.  For a long time I prayed that God would change me, to make me into what he needed me to be.  Over time I realized that changing wasn't an option, not because God couldn't do it, but because I was created this way for a purpose.  Whether it is okay to engage into a same-sex relationship or not, I am not sure.  It is really important to know the difference between what it is to be Gay and what it is to be promiscuous.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question, I am gay, but I love God more.  I know that when he asks me to commit my everything to Him, it means my heart, my soul, my deep desires for a relationship....everything.  When I focus on God completely nothing else truly matters.  I find comfort in Him!|`|9741a3f7ecd87afb6df1b22885eb0f22aa	Well, there is only one God, so we are praying to the same one.  For those who like to say that one cannot be a gay Christian I just want to say that God reveals to us what we need, when we need it.  Just because something has not yet been revealed to you does not mean your interpretation is the ONLY correct one.  I, for one, will continue to rely on what God reveals to me, and not what men may say.|`|xsZB4XDFaa	Gay Christians are just ignoring the parts in the Bible where it clearly points out that homosexuality is a sin.  It is no different than any other sin.  I just really am confused why they think that it is ok.  They have seriously been deceived.  I have issues that are sinful, but I definitely call a sin a sin.  I am not perfect, nobody is (except Jesus)!  <br>  <br>  As far as God listening to their prayers, it does say in the Bible that if we choose to ignore his commandments and moral practices....he will close his ears to our prayers.  That is only if we continue to sin and refuse to admit that we are doing anything wrong (when it spells out in the Bible that it is wrong).<br>  <br>  People who are in the homosexual lifestyle and "proud of it" and refuse to admit that it is sin are NOT listening to the Bible and God.

There is no such thing as a Gay Christian, one cannot be both homosexual AND a professing Christian. The two lifestyles are as much in contradiction as an Atheist also being a Creationist.<br>  Since the Bible makes obvious statements about the homosexual lifestyle, (Lev 18:22; 1 Cr 6:9 etc) to be a homosexual and yet profess Christianity would be hypocritical and an obvious exercising of willful ignorance concerning basic doctrines and statements there of. <br>  <br>  I am not trying to offend anyone, I am just stating a fact. I have plenty of gay friends whom i love dearly, but they are not Christians because they know what the Bible has to say about it.  I agree with the other answers, there is no such thing as a Homosexual Christian. It's incongruous and a moot point; yet whether or not  they are "praying to the same God" and if that same God "hears their prayers" is as immaterial as it is obvious: Of course they are and of course he does.<br>  <br>  But people always want to change the rules to suit their personal opinions as opposed to obey the rules that are already in place. <br>  <br>  *cries into your lap* can you, i or we close the box now?

Z20AjHw1aa	A question for you to consider.  Are you interested in knowing and seeking the truth, or are you interested in making up a god(s) and or faith which fits in to what you  would like him/her/them to be?<br>  <br>  I can only offer you this advice, if you want to seek and find the truth (and there can only be one truth), then ask the God who created you to show you.   If you want to seek your own truth, then be prepared to be bombarded with confusion and doubt and things which "seem" right. Sometimes what appears inviting, exciting and enticing is the very thing which  pulls you the furthest away from the truth.<br>  <br>  With regards to your parents, simply gently tell them your doubts.  I am a Christian, but not a Catholic ( I too struggle with some of the doctrine, rituals and traditions and therefore would have talked to my parents too about my concerns.) I also have a daughter who is asking questions about God, her life, her faith and her doubts.  My advice to her is the same as I shall give to you, you have to seek the truth for yourself. When she asks something about God, I will give her every answer that I know, however it is up to her whether she wants to know the truth, or whether she wants to follow some other path, which although I believe is false, she has free will to reject or embrace the truth (and there are plenty of things that will entice you and that you can choose from).<br>  <br>  I hope and pray that on your journey in life, one day, you will seek and know the truth.  May God bless you :-)|`|pGf4mIw9aa	There is a thing that I teach and it's called keeping things between you and God. When Jesus started doing the will of his father. He told his mother, the disciples, the multitude and the Pharisees, I am about my Father business. Jesus did not get permission from Mary or anyone else. Whatever God had for him to do, he did it. Understand that you are suppose to search for God within and pray that he will reveal himself to you but you must also believe in him. When you go to church, do not look at as if you are going to church for the wrong reasons, but look at it as if you are going there to have a little peace between you, God and no one else. God does not care about your religion. He just want you to have a relationship between you and him. <br>  <br>  Let me ask you this. If Mary and Joseph would have taken Jesus to a Wicca church, do you believe that Jesus would have practice it. Than wind up teaching it? No because that was not of his Father will. The best way I can tell you this is this. Just because your body is there at the service, doesn't mean your spirit has to be. I have been to nearly a hundred churches, worked for three preachers and two missions, and believe me, I have shut down mentally and allowed God to teach me through the Holy Spirit. Because either the service was boring, The preacher was talking about something that did not benefit my life (basically a money hungry preacher), or one who would preach as if he had acted out the sermon weeks ago. Try it, and watch how God will talk to you. But you must have the faith and believe that God will talk to you. People will tell you that you are crazy for believing that God will talk to you. I may be crazy, but this is one crazy person going to heaven when I die. Just something to think about. I am not telling you this stuff from here say, or from someone else experience. This doesn't come from a book but it comes from someone who had to say the heck with what other believes. I have to have a relationship with God to believe what he wants me to believe.

u2BVwAKNaa	Paganism (from Latin paganus, meaning "country dweller, rustic")[1] is the blanket term given to describe religions and spiritual practices of pre-Christian Europe, and by extension a term for polytheistic traditions or folk religion worldwide seen from a Western or Christian viewpoint. The term has various different meanings, though, from a Western perspective, it has modern connotations of a faith that has polytheistic,[2] spiritualist, animistic or shamanic practices, such as a folk religion, historical polytheistic or neopagan religion.<br>  <br>  The term has been defined broadly, to encompass all of the religions outside the Abrahamic monotheistic group of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[2] The group so defined includes most of the Eastern religions, Native American religions and mythologies, as well as non-Abrahamic ethnic religions in general. More narrow definitions will not include any of the world religions and restrict the term to local or rural currents not organized as civil religions. Characteristic of pagan traditions is the absence of proselytism and the presence of a living mythology which explains religious practice.[3]<br>  <br>  The term "pagan" is a Christian adaptation of the "gentile" of Judaism, and as such has an inherent Abrahamic bias, and pejorative connotations among Western monotheists,[4] comparable to heathen, and infidel, mushrik and kafir (????) in Islam. For this reason, ethnologists avoid the term "paganism," with its uncertain and varied meanings, in referring to traditional or historic faiths, preferring more precise categories such as polytheism, shamanism, pantheism, or animism; however others criticise the use of these terms, claiming that these are only aspects that different faiths may share and do not denote the religions themselves.<br>  <br>  Since the later 20th century, "Pagan" or "Paganism" has become widely used as a self-designation by adherents of Neopaganism.[5] As such, various modern scholars have begun to apply the term to three separate groups of faiths: Historical Polytheism (such as Celtic polytheism and Norse paganism), Folk/ethnic/Indigenous religions (such as Chinese folk religion and African traditional religion), and Neo-paganism (such as Wicca and Germanic Neopaganism).<br>  <br>  Wicca (IPA: /?w?k?/) is a neopagan, nature-based[1] religion popularised in 1954 by Gerald Gardner, a retired British civil servant, who at the time called it Witchcraft and its adherents "the Wica".[2] He said that the religion, of which he was an initiate, was a modern survival of the witch cult, an old mystery religion that had existed in secret for hundreds of years, originating in the pre-Christian paganism of Europe.[2] The veracity of Gardner's statements cannot be independently proven, however, and it is possible that Wiccan theology began to be compiled no earlier than the 1920s.[3] It has been described as "the only religion that England has ever given the world". [4][5]<br>  <br>  Wiccans, as followers of Wicca are now commonly known, typically worship a God[6] (traditionally the Horned God) and a Goddess (traditionally the Triple Goddess), who are sometimes represented as being a part of a greater pantheistic Godhead, and as manifesting themselves as various polytheistic deities. Other characteristics of Wicca include the ritual use of magic, a liberal code of morality and the celebration of eight seasonal-based festivals.<br>  <br>  There is dispute as to what actually constitutes Wicca. Initially, it referred to the lineage of one of Gardner's rivals, Charles Cardell,[7] although in the 1960s it began to refer instead only to lineages stemming from Gardner and operating as initiatory Mystery Priesthoods (such as Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca). These are now collectively known in North America as British Traditional Wicca.[8] A third usage, which has grown in popularity in recent years, and which was debatably the original usage,[9] considers Wicca to include other forms of Goddess-oriented neopagan witchcraft that are similar to but independent of that lineage, including Cochrane's Craft, Dianic Wicca and the 1734 Tradition; these are sometimes collectively termed Eclectic Wicca|`|xRUZkFU9aa	pagan = bad<br>  wiccan = "good"<br>  lol|`|SElevHteaa	Pagans and Wiccans 20% off come buy them while their cheap.|`|283tO9j9aa	All Wiccans are Pagan, but not all Pagans are Wiccan.<br>  <br>  Pagan is a catch-all term for hundreds (most likely thousands) of religions other than the ones you see all the time. They're generally polytheistic, pantheistic or deistic rather than having one almighty god. Some don't even really have gods as such. Some religious people (far from all of them) use Pagan to describe things that they think are evil. That's crap, Pagans are usually pretty cool and don't try to push their beliefs on anyone.<br>  <br>  Wicca is relatively new- it was founded this century by Gerald Gardner, and is based on some history of European Pagan religions. Wiccans often believe in the Lord and Lady, who represent the male and female in all things, although they may call them by different names. They appreciate the natural world and believe that wishing harm on others will only bring harm back to you- essentially, that's karma.|`|MkZC5gd6aa	Pagan = What the christians called the old religions<br>  Wiccan = Teenage girls who watch too much Buffy the Vampire Layer

You cannot serve two masters at the same time.<br>  Why are you so defensive about your FSM? And what is your accusation? You already said that SOME christians become defensive, but you never said what they are defending or what you have attacked. Have you attacked their beliefs? And are they defending their beliefs or are they defending their integrity? You need to be clear on the matter and know the difference. They never did attack your belief in the FSM, just your childish behaviour in handling such an issue.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	There's certainly no reason to be defensive. <br>  <br>  Many arguments can given for the existence of God. For example, there are cosmological arguments (arguments for a first cause), teleological arguments (arguments for a Grand Designer), moral arguments (arguments for a Moral Lawgiver), and others. Anyone who is serious about the question of God must deal with these arguments before dogmatically rejecting belief in God. <br>   <br>  In contrast with the serious issue of God’s existence, Flying Spaghetti Monsterism is known to be made up. It is believed by no one. Even the so-called advocates of the FSM do not really believe that it exists.  <br>  <br>  There are no technical philosophical arguments for the FSM. Actually, there are no technical arguments of any kind for the FSM. ) Even those who sarcastically espouse that the FSM exists don’t really believe that the FSM exists, nor do they think that the FSM is a coherent explanation for finite contingent being, logic, morality, beauty, etc.  <br>  <br>  No one therefore really believes in the FSM, but even if they did, it would not be rationally satisfying.<br>   <br>  On the other hand, belief in God is prevalent among all peoples of all times and there are many sophisticated philosophical arguments for God’s existence.  <br>  <br>  The Christian God is a coherent explanation of why something exists rather than nothing, why logic is prescriptive and universal, why morality is objective, and why religion is ubiquitous.  <br>  <br>  Belief in such a God is therefore rational and satisfying.<br>  <br>  Further more there is archaelogical and historical evidence that supports many things that are in the Bible but not one shred of credible evidence for the existence of a FSM, so how can a the FSM be just as valid a belief?|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	Are you really that naive that you need it explained? Or do you just like trying to breed angst amongst people against Christians?<br>  <br>  Of course we become defensive when you talk about the FSM, as the whole concept is a construct to try and ridicule anyone who believes that there is a God.<br>  <br>  It would be like me poking you with a stick constantly, and then saying "why are you getting agitated... *poke*"|`|dZFwQPsGaa	To me, it is just sad,  God obviously exists, and this is proven through Jesus.  How else could Christianity have come about so rapidly?  Why else would 10 out of 12 of the apostles die for their belief in Jesus?  They had no power or money, yet they flourished rapidly.  How did they convert so many of those that believed the FSM (i.e. Zeus, Hera, Apollo etc.) ?  The early Christian had several chances to worship God as long as they made sacrifices at the other temples.  Many of them would not--several chose death instead.  Why wouldn't they compromise?<br>  <br>  <br>  I guess what really annoys me is that some clown writes a book and leads people down a false path using incomplete logic.  Monotheism is not the natural evolution of religion, polytheism is.  Today, we should have at least as many gods as countries.  What we see is that most people follow one God (Islam, Judaism and Christianity).<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I see no one has valid points countering my argument.<br>  <br>  Let me say this:  God sys in the bible that He is the only real God--there are no others.  So, if you believe in God, then there are no others (FSM or otherwise) and all the others are invalid.  If there is no God, then hats off to the FSM.  <br>  <br>  They cannot both be valid.|`|bMVJkCShaa	... because they all suffer from wheat intolerance?|`|fuPqQPvtaa	Perhaps they don't like the smell of his garlic seasoning?|`|AA11974194	Because lasagna will never be the same.|`|QwKiK85eaa	There scared of the flying spaghetti monster|`|AA11992885	it IS a double standard<br>  <br>  one of the HUGE problems with christianity is a lack of teaching certain principles<br>  <br>  it teaches a person to go out without tolerance, and convert the world<br>  <br>  Judahism teaches, to not allow evil INTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL.....but outside of Israel, keep your mouth shut, it isn't your business, do not taunt your neighbors<br>  <br>  Islam teaches the same as christianity, though it also teaches in a different place of the Koran, to not antagonize the christians and jews.....funny though, these are the very people that Islam taunts and antagonizes the most|`|aPuUuWlLaa	They have hardened their hearts against him.

05d37286bed96dc28e6b203a5182c768aa	What that scripture means to me is this, as a parent I always strive to give my kids the best we had. It may not be the best there was to have, it was the best I could give them. I did not hold back my best effort, I gave freely to my children.<br>  <br>  If I compare that to my heavenly Father who is unlimited in power and resources, with the same view in mind that I would give my all for my children, as a follower of the true God Jehovah I am assured that when we are promised that Jehovah will open his hand & satisfy our desire until there is no more want. All we have to do is what it says at John 17:3.|`|faiqPeWDaa	I think it means that just as human's as parents give the best they can to their children (bread instead of stone, fish not serpant), our spiritual father will do the same for us.  If people, who are flawed and who sin, have this as an inherent instinct, then surely God who is not flawed will provide even greater things out of love.<br>  <br>  I think it still relevant because it reminds us of the bonds that bring people together, and that giving and sharing all you can is about demonstrating love for other people - this is a lesson we need now more than ever.|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	It means, that if you ask, and keep on asking (but not out of greed, and not while living in blatant sin) then He will answer your prayer as a Father helps his son.<br>  <br>  Of course it is still relevant!

You can't put God in a box and say He caused pain and suffering because Jesus told us that though God the Father loves us, pain and suffering are part of the wages of sin, even Jesus suffered on this earth for sin of the whole world.<br>  <br>  We aren't paying for the sin of Adam and Eve, but the sin we committ daily, by thinking badly about another person, to the point of hate, complaining about things that are happening to us or to other people; like you want everything perfect.  Well this isn't a perfect world and never will be, so once we get over that part and just try to the best to our own abilities we will feel His grace and Love because we just received His gift of understanding.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Every moment is a perfect gift from God.<br>  The gifts here are good gifts, but the alternatives look similar but have a bite or are of no use.<br>  <br>  When we complain about anything in our lives we are not seeing past the appearance that the world has taught us to see to the gift of truth that lies beneath it.

Pray; pray often; make a business of prayer, and be serious and earnest in it. Ask, as a beggar asks alms. Ask, as a traveller asks the way. Seek, as for a thing of value that we have lost; or as the merchantman that seeks goodly pearls. Knock, as he that desires to enter into the house knocks at the door. Sin has shut and barred the door against us; by prayer we knock. Whatever you pray for, according to the promise, shall be given you, if God see it fit for you, and what would you have more? This is made to apply to all that pray aright; every one that asketh receiveth, whether Jew or Gentile, young or old, rich or poor, high or low, master or servant, learned or unlearned, all are alike welcome to the throne of grace, if they come in faith. It is explained by a comparison taken from earthly parents, and their readiness to give their children what they ask. Parents are often foolishly fond, but God is all-wise; he knows what we need, what we desire, and what is fit for us. Let us never suppose our heavenly Father would bid us pray, and then refuse to hear, or give us what would be hurtful.
KDNWFuZWaa	I personally believe this all started after a guy one night got caught drunk and in bed with a goat, he blamed his sister in law for being a witch and casting a spell on him to get him out of the embarrassment of facing up to what he actually done.

Christians do not give God the benefit either because they are laying hands on someone and claiming to heal them and if they really were letting God do the healing, there should not be any need for the middleman.  So, I guess this means that some Christians (pentecostals) are witches and they are the ones who scream the loudest about how evil witchcraft is.|`|VncSMLMpaa	The LORD God condemned the following of the occult, witches etc. These have no place in following the LORD God Almighty.

The love you (hopefully) have for your Mom and Dad or brother(s) or sister(s).  You love them because you are related to them and family should take care of one another.<br>  <br>  Agape: This is the highest form of love.  This is choosing to love someone irregardless of their flaws and though they are no way deserving of love.  This is unconditional love.  This is God's love for us.  Jesus loved John with agape love.

Most of our images of Christ come from much, much later (ie the Medieval period).  Second, it is hot in the Middle East.  Many people wear loose clothing to stay cool which is only practical.  Thirdly, the Bible was written centuries after Christ lived so we really don't know what happened during his life.  Fourthly, women were considered less important both during Christ's life and during the time after when the Bible was written.  He may have had women disciples but they would be considered too unimportant to mention by the patriarchal church.  Read Genesis Chapter 5.  The genealogies list, by name, all or most of the sons but barley mention the daughters.|`|2eNX1wnJaa	Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) was a devout jew. Contrary to common belief, he had short hair (1 Cor 11:14; Matt 10:30; Luke 12:7).

3cnGPqt3aa	I can't speak for others, but I see so many of the real things in the world and the universe as "magical"  The way life has come about, the way the universe works,all of nature, human abilities in art, music, technology, literature, scientific discovery and understanding, all sorts of other things.<br>  <br>  All these things hold magical qualities enough for me, I don't need to believe in anything else, and I'm sure that many atheists feel the same way.  It's not like we know everything about all these things, there is still a great deal of mystery and a great many possibilities, there is so much that may never be known or fully understood.<br>  <br>  What is close minded about appreciating what we have, rather than wishing for something more or different? :)|`|WbaN6osZaa	atheists can believe anything they want.<br>  <br>  Christians have to believe the Bible.<br>  <br>  I once asked the same question to theists and atheists:<br>  <br>  "if there was undeniable proof that god exists/doesn't exist, would you change your beliefs"<br>  <br>  All the atheists said 'yes', while all the theists (bar one) said 'no' or 'this doesn't make sense, God DOES exist!"<br>  <br>  Why would the atheists be (hypothetically) prepared to follow the evidence, but not the theists?<br>  <br>  I would be prepared to consider that there are a gazillion universes all pooped out by mystical monkeyhorses or angry men in the sky, if there was firm evidence...<br>  <br>  Does it make me close minded?

You don't for example, believe in Zeus, do you? And for the fundies, anything that even hints that their version is wrong is evil and must be fought - cf. evolution.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Yes, I consider blind faith in absurd, unfounded tenets to be indicative of closed-mindedness.<br>  In fact, faith, by definition, has to be closed-minded.  You cannot consider any evidence, and you cannot admit that you might be wrong or subject it to any fair critical analysis.  If you do so, you would no longer have belief without evidence AKA faith.|`|AGbA9XS8aa	"I mean, we're the ones that believe in the "magical" things, not you, remember?"<br>  <br>  We all believe in magic when we're kids.

They feel we are being forcfull and they hate the fact that the bible says that if you don't believe you go to hell... now I'm not sure about all that but I feel Ii have to be very carefull about who I speak to.. also there was a flight attendent that wasn't allowed to wear her cross at work which I think is terrible.. if people are allowed to wear head scarf then we should be allowed to wear crosses... I find that soem not all people, when you say that your christian they just think you are blind on need to face reality.. everyones entitled to there own opinion., but they should also respect that we have ours also as christians, the majority don't believe anymore and I have many friends who are athiasts.. but we have fun debating it.. we are never hostile to eachother.. and I wont talk to someone like they are stupid cause they don't believe as I expect them to not think I am stupid because I do believe.|`|znjl6WrWaa	I've come across it before. People that get so upset just by the fact that you're Christian. But it can be both ways. You see it on Y!A a lot. The atheists get all upset about people believing in an "invisible man" and the Christians getting riled up telling people that they're going to burn in hell. I think personal beliefs are a touchy subject and in a medical field some people get very upset because they don't understand the patient's reasoning. They think it's all superstition (and maybe it is in some cases but who are we to judge). Some religions won't allow blood transfusions or transplants. Some won't allow antibiotics. I think some of the people in the medical community start to generalize and think that ALL religious people are to the extreme.

People tend to not see eye to eye and get upset about it when that happens even if they are theists. For some people its just an intensely private thing. It seems to me some Christian groups as part of their beliefs and message desire to be more and more vocal about it. This comes into conflicts in public with people of diverse opinions. Personally, when I go to a doctor or hospital I am there to have my physical needs met. I do appreciate if they are kind and compassionate but if they start addressing spirituality with me I'd be put out. That is not what I am there for and if I need it there are more appropriate sources such as the pastor, priest, family members who share the same views, friends, etc...

Sometime in the 19th century the idea that being born again meant a conversion experience was popularized. I'm sure it helped make the people who came to the revival meetings feel more important, so the idea took off.<br>  <br>  Most modern born-again Christians don't even know that they're following a fad less than two centuries old.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	In my opinion it is not true... <br>  <br>  because the "born again" crowd have adopted the central theme of Paul who said: Christ died for our sins.<br>  <br>  Paul/Saul was the one who terrorized the first Christians, and then after Christ was gone, went on to declare himself an apostle!<br>  <br>  This will explain the whole crazy mix up if you want to research the whole thing: <a href="http://gospelenigma.com" rel="nofollow">http://gospelenigma.com</a>|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	It's not really true dear.  "Born again" are not catholics, therefore they are technically  heretics.

We, true Christians, are born again, not being a baby gain or something like that. Being born again is something spiritual, recognizing God as your personal Lord, Savior and Heavenly Father.

It's like being adopted into His family knowing that He will care and guide you.|`|IrQRizoVaa	I wouldnt say that the only real Christians are those who call themselves born again, but i would say that most who call themselves born again are real christians.

Many real christians also call themselves 'believers'|`|2eNX1wnJaa	Every sect believes they are the "real christians." Traditionally, being "Born Again" required baptism (Catholic) or at least an intense conversion experience ("Protestants").

I was baptized Catholic as an infant. I never stopping believing God existed but I didn't go to church for 15 yrs and ignored God all that time. A huge event happened in my life and I return to the Church and God. I consider myself a born-again Catholic because I am devote now. I talk to God daily and study His word and learn as much as I can. I try to put God first and before all that I do. I messed up in the past but not I'm really a Catholic.

For too many years I held myself back, now if I'm emotional I'm not going to stick a cork in it and pretend I'm a robot. That's all in the past. At high school I took a lot of **** and was cold about it (or replied with a knuckle sandwich) however these days I give as good as I get and if someone pisses me off they most certainly know about it. Generally I think being open feels much better and is freer. I cry if I need to cry (although most people see me as a very controlled person).

KTKxrP7naa	You're not weird. It's good that you've learned 2 languages. However, based on what you're writing, I'd have to say you most certainly do not speak perfectly. It's not just the spelling mistakes. You also don't seem to have control over the past tense; you used "come" "go" and "learn" in the present when these should have been past. But, I'm still glad you speak two.|`|73250ff641e2c3cc52bb285aea5f1d3daa	No. My native language is Mandarin Chinese, and I live in the United States and speak fluently in either language(although my vocabulary is dwindling for Chinese O_o)<br>  <br>  And now I'm trying to learn French and Japanese, although I'm planning to take them in classes with them later on.|`|VNrchvUNaa	No... of course not.

I think it depends how you learned them.  In my fifth-year Japanese classes, there are always a couple of students who were just raised bilingual, but have never actually taken Japanese in school.  Their parents just moved here when they were small and they picked English up by osmosis while continuing to learn Japanese from their parents. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it seems most of them speak both fluently, but there is something a little strange, slow and unnatural about both their English and Japanese.<br>  <br>  Also, I had some Malaysian friends from school in Japan who were raised with about five languages each (usually Malay, Cantonese, Mandarin and English plus something else); of course, they also spoke Japanese.  They were fine in all of them, but they would often lament on not feeling "fluent" in ANY of them.  <br>  <br>  I would say how jealous I was they they were proficient in so many languages, and one friend said, "At least YOU can say you're fluent (native) in one language; I can't."<br>  <br>  Still, it's really cool, better than most people, and useful obviously.

If we do not question god, why do we question?|`|ezQWo6qvaa	This one is difficult to answer because it requires me to know what others places of fear are. So, I venture to say that I have found through experience that what is MY normal means that I have, in the eyes of others around me, seemed to have stuck my neck on the line more often than most I've known, and I've had many rewarding experiences as a result. This does, by no means, make me a hero. I do, however, have a brave heart, and through loving fearlessly, have experienced magnificent richness in my relationships and through my contacts, throughout my life. Being clairsentient (seeing and hearing the unseen realms), provides  experiences of great awe and wonder simply because I am uncensoring and completely open to all forms of loving energy. Life is for loving. I am a lover. Ergo, what is drawn to me through this energy is always good. I do know some people are afraid to explore energy at work in their lives, so ultimately I guess I could say that "Yes", I do feel at home in places and states that others fear to tread.|`|AA11149408	I am not that well voiced in what others fear or avoid, but I do tend to support the underdog and admire the unusual.

Something that really helps is learning, maybe in a class.  Remember those aha! moments when you learn something?  Well you create neurons when you learn new things.

Some churches do turn parents away from a possibly gay child which is sick but then again does it surprise you? Religion is disgusting and teaches nothing but intolerance and starts wars.

It shouldnt, and if it does then you need serious psychiatric help.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	With all the sin, gross sexual perversion, lies, corruption and all the other garbage and ugliness we see everyday, a little "brainwashing"  would be good for all of us. <br>  <br>  "Now little James, just because that old man wants you to sleep with him, doesn't mean he's a bad person."  <br>  <br>  Little James should be playing with truck toys, not Barbie dolls.<br>  <br>  Edit: ""Their child is simply walking in Jesus and John footsteps after all...

Vugfv39uaa	It depends on what you like. I think Canada is more democratic and more rational in its policies than the US. The people seem to have more of a voice and things are more equal. I'm referring to the gay rights and the marijuana legalization that's making its way across Canada. But, I like the fact that I can own guns in America. I don't trust my government enough to give up my weapons.<br>  <br>  Stronger...militarily it is the U.S. by far, but we spend more on defense than any other country in the world. I hate to say it, but I miss those feelings after 9/11 that were prevalent in the U.S., because there was some solidarity within the American public and we united as a culture. Now we argue about everything and we're trying to figure out how we want to live. I think Canada is more strong in that sense. They know what they want and they seem to be better at getting it than we are.<br>  <br>  More patriotic I would say is the U.S. Whether it's just by blind faith or ignorance, many U.S. Americans think they live in the greatest country in the world and they have never been anywhere else. Most of us can't afford to go anywhere else just because our cost of living is so damn high, but that's besides the point.<br>  <br>  Both countries have their good and bad points. There's no sense in meaningless debates trying to figure out which is better. Compare the laws and the freedoms to how you want to live and decide from there.|`|GvqOB5FLaa	you can't really say a nation is better than another nation. as in (stronger) you mean military, economic and global influence it's by far the U.S because at the moment no other country can compete.

AA11897918	You have asked a great  question<br>  <br>  It is not specifically mentioned in the bible but has been a contentious issue for centuries.<br>  <br>  Those in favor say that any person should have the right to end hi/her life when continuing it means unbearable pain and suffering which cannot be cured.<br>  <br>  Those NOT in favor say that LIFE is given to you by your creator and that only your creator can end it. They go on to say that if legalized, some UNSCRUPULOUS person could take advantage of an older person and use "euthanasia" as an excuse in order to seize a person's money or property.<br>  <br>  The American eskimo and Indian solved the problem hundreds of years ago.  When a person reached a certain age and appeared to be too ill or weak to be a contributing person in the tribe, they would honor that person in a ceremony and then place him/her on an ice flow and push it gently out into the ocean where that person would die a painless freezing sleep.<br>  <br>  Only the Dutch government has legalized euthanasia in the western world and it seems to be accepted in that country.  In America, Dr Morganthaler practiced it on several patients and was prosecuted in court for doing so.<br>  <br>  Hope this info is what you were seeking.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Personally I think it should be legal.<br>  <br>  But, it can't be 100% legal - it is open to whopping huge amounts of abuse.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	2008年11月16日 is "November 16, 2008." <br>  2008年11月14日 is "November 14, 2008." <br>  <br>  Chinese people will write things from largest to smallest, so they'll put the year first, then the month, and then the date. Then, they'll mark the year, month and day with a character. 年 (nián) is the measure word for "year," 月 (yuè) is the measure word for "month" (the character also means "moon"), and 日 (rì) is the measure word for "day" (the character also means "sun").<br>  <br>  So, "November 14, 2008" would be 2008年11月14日 in Chinese.

They thought that the world just got created somehow and everything is completely random. So, this wise man told them to wait for him in a certain place the next day. So, the day came and so did the men. But that wise man wasn’t there. They waited for so long. So, as they were about to leave, they saw him through the distance coming. When he reached them, they asked him why he was so late. So the wise man told them that he had to cross a river in order to reach this certain place and there was not boat on the shore that day. So, they asked him how he got there after all. He told them that as he stood on the side of the river; a piece of wood came floating. Then suddenly another piece of wood came along. Then a third one came floating from the other way. Then, a fourth piece of wood came by. And then suddenly as he was standing, the four pieces of wood came together and all floated to his direction. So, he stood on and the pieces of wood floated to the other side and that was how he crossed over. So, the men were confused and wondered if he was mocking them. So, the wise man told them how they could not believed that four pieces of wood randomly came together and believed that the entire world was randomly created!!"<br>  <br>  And, you know why i believe in God. because if there is no God, and no rising from Death, then what is life exactly? what is the meaning of life?!! it makes no sense. let's assume that life has no sense and that all you do is just do whatever you do. but what about consequences?<br>  <br>  i mean, a guy who lived and helped the poor and always smiled in front of everyone and loved everyone around him, and made a big amount of money to live happily ever after, then a man came stole all the money, killed the good man, built up his life over other's, who ws injust to people, who did every wrong doing just to get to what he wants? So, tell me, if that was life, and there was no judgement day where everyone gets his lost rights and pay for his wrong doings, then when these two people die (The good man, and the bad man), that is it? they are equal? the one who devoted his lives for others and whose right to live was stolen from him is equal to the evil man who killed him and enjoyed the money?<br>  <br>  The examples in life are many, they don't have to be the same as this example? but where is justice? i think that is what makes no sense... Atheism makes no sense...<br>  <br>  Why do i believe in God?<br>  because if u think about that for a minute, you will realize that the human being is a very very weak creature. He has no power over a lot of things in his life, just a car hitting him is strong enough to kill him. haven't you wondered how people sometimes die in their sleep for no clear reason? the reason is that Allah (God) is the Only One who can stop your heart beat in a second, who can destroy all of what you have worked for in a blink of an eye. God gave you everything you have, he gave you your sight, your hearing and everything else, yet people now claim that there is no God and that they are the only ones in control over their lives.<br>  <br>  here are sites that show you some of the scientific miracles in the Quran:<br>  <a href="http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/index2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.miraclesofthequran.com/index2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.islamicmedicine.org/medmiracl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.islamicmedicine.org/medmiracl...</a><br>  <br>  Thinking about the food chain, if only one species died (let's say ants for example), the whole system of the world will fall apart.

i5LDHsHpaa	The Five Books of Moses (Torah as the five books together are often referred to as) as well as Prophets and Writings (Ketuvim and Neviim) were theoretically beginning to get put together around the time Jesus was walking around the earth, two thousand years ago. That's not to say Judaism hadn't already existed - however, that was when they began to canonize the writings - trying to determine which had always been there, and which hadn't been. Some books such as Acrophya (my spelling there is wrong) were thrown out because they were not believed to have been written at the same time as everything else.<br>  <br>  And Jesus did not fulfill all of the prophecies, even by Christian standards (Jewish standard and interpretation is that he fulfilled none, but that's a different argument), which is why Christians believe in the Second Coming.  Their belief that Jesus was the messiah can only be proved if a Second Coming occurs and he's at the head of it.|`|FmazIF6Maa	The OT is different from the Torah, it was changed a bit, and the way Christians translate and interpret some things is different than the way that Jews do. <br>  <br>  So yeah, it's easy for Christians to say they Jews are wrong about Jesus, if you throw in the NT and only read the Christian translations/interpretations of the Torah. <br>  <br>  If you read the Jewish translation/interpretation, it's pretty clear to see Jesus didn't meet the criteria to be the messiah.|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Seeing as he read from it:<br>  "He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom.

And Jesus fulfilled all righteousness by taking on the sins of the world when He was baptized by John the Baptist the last earthly high priest, and then walked to the Cross as our scapegoat to pay for these sins with His lifeblood.

While a good majority of Americans have a non-regional accent, often called a Midwestern accent, other regions like Texas, the South, New York, Boston and so forth have unique accents.Every nation of the world has accents.Just by living a few miles away from each other, you can get a different accent. Think about your country!<br>  <br>  3.The direct answer to your question is " Everyone has an accent, every language has an accent, every region has a different accent ". all All people have accent. Americans are not exeptional.Further the accent depends where, which country, which state, which region the person is from.<br>  <br>  4.In our world today, people move from state to state and from country to country.

Oiupz7lBaa	Mine was the story of oisin in tir nan og (irish Folklore). It was about a boy called oisin son of Fionn maccumhaill . Oisin meets a beautiful woman (Niamh of the golden hair) and together they gallop across the sea on a magic horse to tir na  nog (land of eternal youth) and they live there together<br>  .Eventually homesickness sets in and Oisín wants to return to his native land. He is devastated to learn three hundred years have passed in Ireland since he had been with Niamh, though it seemed to him only one. He goes home on Niamh's magical horse, but she warns him not to touch the ground, as the weight of all those years would descend upon him in a moment. While Oisín is helping two men move a stone, he falls from the horse and ages in an instant. He is so weak he cannot get back onto his horse and it gallops away two men took him to and old mans home oisin told the old man his story and then he died and no one ever saw Niamh or the white horse again|`|9WMaZdQWaa	My mom used to tell me 'Princess Stories' that she made up.

cZRJgQbXaa	Different dictionarys have different numbers of radicals. That depends upon what they count as the radical and how many old symbols they have. They are heaps and heaps of old obscure radicals that are never used or put in modern dictionaries that would bloat the number of radicals by a ridiculous magnitude.<br>  <br>  It is commonly accepted though that there is about 200 radicals in common use in Chinese - a few more in traditional character sets.

AA10948829	It depends on the translator. Translators have an immense amount of power when it comes to translating a book and can change emphasis on certain aspects depending upon the translator's point of view. The best translators are one who try to stay as accurate to the text as possible but that can be a very hard thing to do, especially as each language has certain phrases that do not translate well into the other.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	It shouldn't be at all inferior to the original that's why only expert translators do the job... someone who is fluent at both languages and who also gets the meanings which make no sense if you translate them literally.. the translator of a book has to be familiar with all of that and translate it in a way so it comes across just as funny or as sad.. the correct meaning has to be there.. and often literal translation is not possible therefore a translator of books has to think outside the box and know how to express the feelings of the characters in a book in a way.. so that the book loses nothing of it's original quality.. otherwise the translator is not good enough for the job.. Some books are translated into hundreds of languages.. take Harry potter. it has to have all the same intrigue and sinister atmosphere...and describe the characters,,, in the book in a way that they come alive for you.. a good translator can do all of that.. and the book won't lose in quality of content at all . If it does.. then the wrong person translated it.. a person who is a professional translator ofr novels.. has to get the atmosphere.. the real meaning of the words.. if something is funny or sarcastic he or she has to integrate all of that in the novel.. in a way that if you can laugh or cry about it in French you will do the same in English...it must lose nothing of all that for it to be translated by an expert...|`|XKytsAQtaa	Translations are never good enough (in my opinion), So, I suggest you to improve your french and then read it.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	It depends on the translator, as previously mentioned (and well-mentioned, at that).<br>  <br>  I'd suggest reading "Les Miserables" in English first, then try it in French when you feel competent and comfortable.<br>  <br>  For me, Gabriel Garcia Marquez' novel "One Hundred Years of Solitude" is one of the most beautiful works I've ever read. i read it in English, after it was translated from the original (Spanish).<br>  <br>  And the works of Isabel Allende are also beautifully translated from Spanish. I highly recommend them, all of the above-mentioned, in English: they lose/lost nothing in the translation, IMHO.<br>  <br>  And consider Joseph Conrad: he was Polish, but wrote in English. His works are the epitome of perfectly-crafted writing.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	I think it's always worth reading the original text, because I like hearing it directly from the source. It has a different feel to it, and the author will no doubt have a subtly different style than the one penning the translation. <br>  <br>  That being said, my first thoughts on reading your question was exactly what Belie said: "It depends on the translator." Some are quite good at their job, and some aren't as good. If you just want to read it for the plot, by all means read the translation. If you want to get an insight to the author's writing style, I suggest trying the original version first. <br>  <br>  Worst case, you learn a lot! I remember trying to read the first Harry Potter book in French (this was years ago), and I ran across the word "était." I had no idea what it meant, so I asked my teacher about it, and learned how to say "was"!

Stereotyping Christians does not prove your point very well. Many (myself included) do not look down on gay people at all.

Putting down Biblical examples don't prove your point either. The Bible is but one tool of many that make people believe in God. Besides, what is wrong with aiming for perfection? Sure beats looking for excuses to treat people badly or destroy yourself with unhealthy behavior. <br>  <br>  3. In answer to your original question: people believe in God because they experience God. It really is as simple as that. If you don't have the experience, then naturally you won't believe.

9kMvxqK9aa	Hola, fui misionera de la Iglesia (SUD - Mormones), dedicamos 2 a?os de nuestras vidas como misioneros a tiempo completos, quiere decir que durante esos dos a?os lo unico que hacemos es predicar o comprartir el evangelio con los demas, en ese tiempo no trabajamos, con vamos a fiestas, no bailamos, no vemos la tele, no escuchamos musica, etc. Y vamos donde nos toque irm nuestro lidere de la Iglesia en este caso el Profeta y sus concejeros mediante oracion nos envian ya sea a cualquier pais de diferente idioma, despues concluido esos dos a?os, seguimos predicando el evangelio pero no por tiempo completo ya que para ese entonces tenemos obligaciones con nuestras propias familias.|`|6wRMdMEUaa	Los TDJ lo hacen de casa en casa los Mormones caminan distancias y escogen solo algunas casas contadas en la cual daran su mensaje...<br>  <br>  Hacker...|`|OtnrMtCAaa	yo creo que a las casas van  menos.....a mi nunca me han llamado a la puerta , también son menos pesados que los testigos. <br>  <br>  <br>  un saludo|`|VntvQhDVaa	En mi esperiencia personal conoci a personas que son Mormones y en ocasiones trataron de convenserme de ir a su iglesia, cosa que si hice para conocer mas sobre esta doctrina y vi que si van a las casas para acojer mas personas aun que no son tan intensos como los Testigos de Jehova a parte que es como mas dificil pues a ellos no les gustan cosas como el tinto, no fuman, llevan una vida muy sana, Los mormones tratan de dar a conocer otros evangelios que no estan incluidos en la Biblia Catolica ni la de los Testigos de Jehova, la diferencia de estas dos Biblias es que en la Catolica a dios le llaman Jhave y en los Evangelicos le dicen Gehova, la Biblia anecxa de los Mormones se llama El Libro del Mormon en el cual a Dios le llaman Dios y ellos si creen y hablan de las Vigenes en este libro.|`|YkLWh4XDaa	Si, en mi casa aparecieron varias veces, ya no se como hecharlos son más insoportables q los demás, no entienden un NO, yo respeto su religión pero ellos no parecen respetar a los demás.|`|l58bCRO3aa	mmm!!!!!   yo tenia una amiga mormona y si, van a las casa pero no del lugar a donde viven, se van a otro lugar a predicar, (me parece que le llaman mision) y tarda un a?o mas omenos, mi amiga siempre nos decia que era su sue?o ir a la mision, pero al final no fue por que se casó. son buena gente a mi me invitaron varias veces a ir con ellos a su capilla, y yo, pues como curiosidad me ganaba siempre les preguntaba cosas de su religion y pues me ense?aron la capilla, el lugar sonde se bautisaban, y me explicaron que para ellos el domingo es sagrado y de la familia, cosa rara para mi pues nunca salen y no ven tele ni nada, ni si quiera van a la tienda de al lado, hacen sus compras un dia antes y solo salen para ir a su capilla.  la verdad fui varias veces para convivir con ellos y no rechazar sus invitaciones por que siempre he sido respetuosa de las demas religiones, y siempre les deje claro sin entrar en controvercia que yo era catolica pero con gusto iba a sus fiertas y reuniones pero no al sermon. a diferencia de los testigos de jeova que al parecer cada determinado tiempo pasan a las casas para invitarte a leer la biblia y cosas asi.<br>  algo bonito de los mormones es que conviven con todos los que van a la capilla aplicando realmente el significado de como se llaman entre si "hermanos" sin distincion de dinero color o cosas superficiales.|`|q9XqZP8caa	Claro que sì porque ellos quieren llegar con sus doctrinas pero son personas que no debemos creerle todo lo que dicen al menos tengo entendido que sì lo hacìan antes pero ahora usan la televisiòn.|`|v9YcciBsaa	creo que si todavia se ven algunos en las calles y son muy facil de identificar, lastima que su doctrina este equivocada.|`|79bc59300c8ae91abcbe020551b00455aa	No como los testigos de Jehova.<br>  <br>  en la iglesia Mormona hay un sistema de proselitismo organizado por medio de misioneros.

8EIXOEooaa	One fun thing to do is have a raffle. Tell people to bring in recyclable material. For every material they bring in and put in a recycling bin, they receive a raffle ticket.

The kanji that make up their names each have meanings, not necessarily the sounds of the name.<br>  <br>  So like, say I meet a guy named Ichigo. Nice name. No idea what it means, but a nice name. It's like meeting a Kevin in the States - the name doesn't have a meaning, it's just a name. <br>  <br>  But when I see him write his name down, I see him write 一護 and I know that the word 一 (ichi) means "one" or "first," and 護 (go) means "defense." He could also write 一期 (ichigo, "lifetime"), 苺 (ichigo, "strawberry"), 一語 (ichigo, "one word"), or even 一五 (ichigo, "one five").<br>  <br>  See what I'm saying? There are just so many words that sound alike but mean different things, that it's hard to tell what any one name means without looking at its written form.|`|65Gk2etyaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  I want to just agree with Kelly that yes Japanese names DO have meanings, but they are determined by the kanji they are made out of.

And why do we fight and start wars because of different religious beliefs? What kind of god would condone such a thing as war? Religion has a lot to answer for.|`|VncSMLMpaa	The word of God in the Scriptures are the inspired words which He has entrusted to mankind for our learning. The people here are shown in their true light with their mistakes and also obedience and faith. Mankind is a strange mixture.<br>  <br>  The Bible shows us what the LORD God wants us to know, especially about His son Jesus who willingly gave himself that we might have everlasting life. But we have to be willing to sit down and read it or even listen to the tapes of it. It is a vital message which we would be best not to neglect.<br>  <br>  There are those who do give a dreadful impression of Christianity but the word of God is far more important than any nonsense people might talk. Read it for yourself and keep reading until it really does make sense, it will if you persist.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	It's deeper because here in the states Reagan first invited the religious right to the table, Clinton allowed them to flourish and GW Bush encouraged them.<br>  <br>  We are teetering on the brink here, just like Turkey.

Take from it what seems right to you and leave the bad bits.<br>  <br>  The behaviour of unholy prophets.    This has to be viewed in what was considered the norm for the age they lived in and not by present standards.<br>  <br>  The violent passages I have no answer for except that certain religions believe it is God's will to protect their religion, by violence if necessary.<br>  <br>  Religion is flawed as it intermingled with human statements that are supposedly the word of God.  Holy wars and crusades are an example and I am sure they are not the concept of God.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	No. Religion is responsible for ruining the image of religion. There have been WAY to many religious genocides and murders for you to write it off as "a few bad seeds."<br>  <br>  And even if you forget the outright violent, most religious people are judgmental and ignorant while simultaneously hungering for control of others, which has lead to countless problems in society. Inequality of women and gays, poor education, AIDS prevalence, death by preventable disease because of religious opposition to advancement, etc etc etc - all of these things are a direct consequence of religion in the US.<br>  <br>  Religion didn't need any help soiling itself.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Sin is part of human nature, the passages prove that  God will forgive all that is unholy, violent and stupid but then that would mean you must humble yourself. <br>  Most people want to be gods themselves, with their own set of rules and regulations, that is the new religion of the modern world, its gone past atheism.|`|tW86bOMNaa	For me, it's deeper than that: it's the underlying message of intolerance associated - particularly by fundamentalists - of all religions.<br>  <br>  Emphasise the positive, and I'd consider it.

But Japan isn't the only one. I know in Chinese, they have "teacher" and "miss" and "mister" to add to the ends of names. Sure, a lot of them correspond to our titles, but they do have them, and they add them to the ends of surnames, just like the Japanese do. I'm also pretty sure Korean does that, as well, though I'm less familiar with the language and am hard-pressed to think of specific examples...|`|8ca92533138d363609f0fc127a9b053aaa	It's just Japanese :D|`|whaLS5n7aa	korean uses the similar -sonsangnim for the same purpose.

It is not profit making, does not have public shareholders, and is responsible to the public.<br>  <br>  Many services in the UK, such as railways, electricity, gas and water, which were once provided by public corporations were sold off to private ( public limited ) companies during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher and these services are now provided by many different companies in competition with each other.|`|3f10efdc062c7553650a50749b7e7aacaa	PLC's are usually floated on the stock exchange so could potentially have millions of shareholders, so the overall performance of the company is paramount to keeping investors happy.

Then there's the really interesting languages, like Native American languages. How could you pick? <br>  <br>  3. I'm a native speaker of American English, and I've been studying Italian for about seven years, now. I've studied French for three years, and am in my first semester of Mandarin Chinese. On my own, I've studied a few others, and - with the aid of a dictionary - can translate simple phrases in them. Mostly I'm familiar with the romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and any dialects thereof), but I'm glad to finally get into the Asian languages.<br>  <br>  4. I learned French because I had to do three years of a language to graduate high school, and we'd lived in Belgium for a few years, so I thought "Why not?" But then we moved to Italy, and our school didn't have fourth-year French, so I switched to Italian, and fell in love with it.

Al limbo también se le conoce como Sheol o los infiernos (no el Infierno). Al morir, Jesús descendió a los infiernos, es decir, fue a predicar el Evangelio a los que habían muerto antes que él, los sacó del limbo y los mandó a cada quien al lugar que les correspondía (el Cielo o el Infierno). Desde entonces el limbo está cerrado y ningún alma puede entrar ahí.<br>  <br>  El Purgatorio es un lugar al que van las almas de aquellas personas que murieron en gracia de Dios, es decir, con verdadero arrepentimiento de sus pecados pero imperfectamente purificados. Al Purgatorio se va para purificarse de los pecados cometidos, se dice 'a reparar pecados'. Todos los que están ahí tienen su salvación segura, pero tienen que purificarse antes de poder estar en presencia de Dios.<br>  <br>  La reencarnación es una doctrina falsa que consiste en la creencia de que el alma del sujeto que muere vuelve a nacer en otro cuerpo. Esta creencia envuelve una concepción dualística del hombre que considera al cuerpo y al alma como dos cosas independientes. Según esta doctrina, el alma es lo único verdadero, mientras que el cuerpo es el lugar de confinamiento temporal del alma, donde ésta queda encerrada hasta que se purifica totalmente de sus ataduras temporales. Según esta doctrina cuando el alma no ha conseguido purificarse totalmente en esta vida, al morir vuelve a encarnarse en otro cuerpo y así sucesivamente hasta que termina su definitivamente su purificación.<br>  <br>  La doctrina de la reencarnación es totalmente incompatible con las tesis cristiana sobre el alma. El alma es la forma sustancial del cuerpo, que le da el ser específico, por lo que no puede llegar a ser la forma de otro cuerpo. El Purgatorio es un lugar específico al que van a dar las almas, no tiene relación con la doctrina de la reencarnación.<br>  <br>  Al morir, lo más seguro es que nos vayamos un tiempo al Purgatorio y luego al Cielo; los que van al Infierno no pasan por el Purgatorio; hay quienes llevan un vida suficientemente santa que mureren sin nada que purificar y entonces se van directamente al Cielo. Nadie va al Limbo y nadie reencarna.<br>  <br>  ?Dios te bendiga!|`|DPYcy1Ygaa	sólo existe cielo e infierno.... ni siquiera existe el pulgatorio... ni naa.... en la biblia no habla de naa de eso... por otra parte antes del infierno hay un lugar donde van las almas que estan destinadas a una eternidad en el infierno y luego en el fin del mundo descenderán al infierno que es mucho peor... pero bueno.... para mí hay cielo e infierno.... y nadie puede decir lo contrario porque en la biblia no habla de algo aparte|`|Rw3TaaKjaa	el limbo no existe.<br>  <br>  Cielo infierno y purgatorio <br>  <br>  En el cielo estarán los que ya eligieron a Dios, el libre albedrío se da solo en la tierra por que se esta en busca de Dios, mas hay quienes lo rechazan. Entonces en el cielo el libre albedrío no será necesario por que el alma ya habrá elegido su mejor opción.<br>  <br>  Tú ya puedes vivir el cielo desde aquí, en la Tierra… Dios nos regala un pedazo de Cielo al permitir que su Hijo Jesús se quedara en la eucaristía, es como podemos vivir con él dentro de nosotros: al Comulgar; el Cielo es vivir con Dios.<br>  <br>  Además, el cielo, más que un lugar es un estado del alma, en que ésta ha llegado a su meta: estar en la presencia de su creador (Dios Padre), Redentor (Dios Hijo), y consolador (Dios Espíritu Santo).<br>  <br>  Por tanto el Cielo es el Lugar o estado del alma en que eternamente gozará de la felicidad y amor al estar unida con Dios eternamente (ya que de el salió al ser creada y a el retorna como su fin), y que cuando llegue la segunda venida de Jesucristo, volverá a unirse el alma con el cuerpo (Glorificado por Dios Padre); para vivir en cuerpo y alma en presencia de Dios, el cuerpo y el alma ya no sufrirán ni trabajaran solo gozará de Dios. <br>  Esto tal vez suene aburrido para algunos, sobre todo para aquellos que no ha llegado su hora de tener una experiencia de Dios en sus vidas, pero comienza a tener sentido cuando esto ha sucedido a alguien. si estas interesado (a) en tener esta experiencia con Dios, y te preguntas ?que hay que hacer para lograrlo? la respuesta es: acercarte a los Sacramentos y la oración... trata de tener momentos de oración, no necesariamente rezos preestablecidos, si no platica y dialoga con dios como lo haces con un amigo, pregúntale cosas o cuéntale tu día, incluso tus broncas, o problemas. <br>  Al principio parecerá inútil, aburrido, sin sentido, pero a pesar de eso no te detengas, y con el tiempo aprenderás a escucharlo y sentirlo, y veras que mi respuesta arriaba escrita, cobrara sentido para ti también.<br>  Pues cuando pruebas una pizca del Amor de Dios, es lo que más desearas para ti y los que te rodean.<br>  <br>  Al cielo van los que han muerto en gracia= se confesaron y arrepintieron de sus pecados veniales capitales y mortales, y por la oración penitencia y sufrimiento expiaron sus culpas por lo cual no van al purgatorio sino directo al cielo.<br>  <br>  Al purgatorio van los que no murieron en pecado mortal (10 mandamientos) pero tuvieron pecados veniales o capitales, o se confesaron de ellos pero tienen que purgar la culpa de sus pecados, tienen garantizado el cielo al purificarse totalmente.<br>  <br>  Al infierno van los que rechazaron a Dios y no se arrepintieron o murieron en pecado mortal sin confesarse. El infierno es definitivo, el que entra a el, ya no puede salir, por eso es importante rectificarnos en esta vida, para no caer en el infierno, pero sobre todo debemos rectificarnos por amor a Dios.<br>  <br>  Mas lo anterior esta a expensas de la misericordia de Dios y de cada caso en particular con el (juicio particular que se da al morir una persona)<br>  <br>  <br>  POR LO TANTO, YO ESTOY TRATANDO DE VIVIR EL CIELO DESDE AQUí, Y ESTOY LUCHANDO POR PODER ESTAR AHí EN LA ETERNIDAD, GOZANDO DE LA GLORIA DE DIOS.<br>  <br>  Si te gustaría que te envíe el recopilado del Catecismo de la Iglesia Católica que habla del cielo, envíame un mail.<br>  <br>  Actualmente existe una polémica sobre el infierno, que el papa dijo que si y que el otro que no. La situación es la siguiente.<br>  El infierno es una verdad de fe, y nadie dijo jamás en la iglesia que no existía, lo que una vez sucedió, es que el Papa Juan Pablo II, hizo hincapié en la realidad del infierno como un estado del alma sin que necesariamente sea un lugar, pero eso no quería decir que no existiera. Lo explico enseguida. <br>  <br>  El infierno es una realidad que se da, por que es el estado del alma que esta en ausencia de Dios, su presencia y su amor. Si en esta vida niegas a Dios o lo alejas de ti por el pecado, de alguna manera ya estas viviendo en el infierno aquí en la tierra, pero sin duda también lo vivirás después de esta vida. Pues Jesús dice que al final de los tiempos todos resucitaremos, pero resucitaremos para vivir lo que en esta vida elegimos. Vivir con Dios o sin Dios. Los que eligieron sin Dios, así vivirán toda la eternidad en la resurrección = infierno.<br>  <br>  El infierno es el sufrimiento consciente del alma al saber que pudo elegir el bien y no lo hizo, y por tanto no esta con su creador que es su principio y su fin. Pierde por tanto la felicidad para la que fue creada.<br>  <br>  El purgatorio, también existe, y este responde a la misericordia de Dios, pues es el lugar o estado del alma en que se purifican las culpas y pecados capitales y veniales, pues cuando una persona no murió en pecado mortal, va al cielo pero al tener pecados menores debe purificar su alma, como ya no lo puede hacer en vida, a través de la oración las buenas obras, el sacrificio o las enfermedades, tiene que hacerlo en el purgatorio, conde sufre la ausencia de Dios, hasta purificarse, pero tiene asegurado que algún día entrará al cielo.|`|iF9AdsAkaa	pues haber, el infierno es donde se van las almas que estan en pecado mortal, que son matar, robar, etc.<br>  <br>  el limbo, anteriormente era el supuesto lugar a donde se iban los bebes sin bautisar, y todas las almas que murieron antes que cristo viniera a la tierra. pero en ningun lugar de la biblia dice eso por eso lo quitaron, es mas es que nunca estubo.|`|FN9wIythaa	usted viene del infierno?|`|GsFkuv9yaa	No hay mención en las sagradas escrituras de un lugar como el limbo.

The only true common factor in atheism is the lack of belief in any supreme being or God.  Belief in creation via a supreme being, god or deity would make me think the person isn't an atheist.  Creationary evolution which is just a fancy way of saying we came from the mud and the cells and the rest is saying that science and evolution got creative (adaptive).  <br>  <br>  Some atheists believe there is intelligent life out there somewhere but this isn't a god belief.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	More and more, there are secular scholars who raise questions about evolution, and the holes and problems with the theory.

There are a few religions that are atheistic and people can hold certain spiritual beliefs while still being an atheist. So just because a person is an atheist does not mean they don't subscribe to some other religious beliefs that may include ideas about the origins of life. <br>  2. Many atheists state their opinions about evolution as "I accept evolution" rather than "I believe in evolution" because the word "belief" indicates faith and evolution is not something that needs to be taken on faith. So there's a reason why someone might say they don't believe in evolution. <br>  <br>  Past that, it is pretty uncommon for someone who is an atheist to not accept evolution. It's actually pretty uncommon for any person to not accept evolution outside of the United States so most of us are going to be at a loss to explain what alternate theories an atheist might have.

If the homosexual can lay with whom ever he or she choses then I should be able to sleep with whom ever I want to. But your self righteosness won't let you make that exception. You will quickly stand behind adultry then. The person that sleeps with his neighbors wife should be given a break also, along with every other sinner.

It is plausible, and it doesn't go against church standards, at least in my church.<br>  <br>  That said, in my church it is not considered a sin to have homosexual feelings or thoughts (which gay people cannot control, at least in the vast majority of cases).  We believe it is only wrong to actively participate in homosexual behavior (which they CAN control).  We do not try and fool ourselves into thinking that everyone's "gay" can be "prayed away", or "cured".  In some cases, through therapy, it is possible for someone to turn heterosexual (it has happened, I promise).  But in most cases, this is not possible.  <br>  <br>  God does not condemn the people who have these homosexual feelings.  Again, it is only a sin if, by personal choice, you choose to participate in homosexual behavior.<br>  <br>  EDIT (to everyone saying "why would anyone choose to be gay"):<br>  I agree that most people wouldn't, and don't.  But I could see a celebrity thinking to themselves, "Hmm. I haven't had publicity in a while.  I'm not all over the front page anymore.  What can I do to regain my popularity?  Oh, I know!  I'll pretend to come out of the closet!"  With so many celebrities "coming out" lately, it seems very likely that AT LEAST one of them is faking it for publicity.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Those who use the Bible to justify their homophobia will never listen to reason, science or even the testimonials of thousands and thousands of gay people.  <br>  <br>  No one in his/her right mind would choose to be gay and put up with the fruits of homophobia.  The fruits of homophobia are pride, ridicule, lies, reviling, prejudice, discrimination, division, unjust laws, hatred, bigotry, gay children being disowned and thrown out of homes by heterosexual parents, people being fired from jobs, attacks, bullying, violence, suicide, destroyed lives, murder of gay people and utter disregard for Christ‘s commandment to treat others as we want to be treated.

Are you saying that the homosexual is incapable of refraining from homosexual sex?  If so, that is obsessive and compulsive and that person is dangerous because they can't help themselves.<br>  <br>  Or are you saying that people can become predisposed to homosexual sex?  If so, then homosexuality is nothing more than another sexual fantasy, similar to pornography.  We're all predisposed to some temptation but we can be expected to resist it.<br>  <br>  So which is it?|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	No!  Homosexuality is not a choice.  It is a disorder and as such is not a moral issue.  But behavior is always a choice and homosexual behavior is always sinful.|`|aHEwm3QLaa	To be fair, some Christians understand that this was not a choice|`|AA11812653	no, it's not a choice, and most people that think it is are not even Christian.

But there are also studies -- which you conveniently omit -- that indicate that sexual preference has psychological underpinnings.  The brains of most (not all) homosexuals are no different than those of heterosexuals of the same sex.<br>  <br>  Psychology also tells us that most of us have homosexual thoughts and/or leanings at some point in our development.  It's perfectly normal.  But for most of us, those feelings are outgrown in a short period of time.<br>  <br>  Regardless, I think you're missing the bigger picture, even if you could prove -- as you incorrectly imply -- that all homosexuality is pre-progammed.<br>  <br>  The point is that homosexuality is specifically named in scripture as sin, just as is adultery, and lying, and jealousy.  We're challenged to overcome our sin, not to revel in it.  You can't be both sinless and living a life of sin -- regardless of what that sin is.<br>  <br>  There's a difference between sinning accidentally (or even purposefully) and being genuinely remorseful for it, and sinning as a habit, and being proud of it.  And that is what Christians have a problem with.<br>  <br>  Christians -- no matter how much homosexuals like to advertise differently -- do not hate homosexuals.|`|R3i7F0ytaa	There is also science that shows people veer off....a lot of gays liked the others first, but then switched.  my sister swithced because her dad was an alcoholic, and she DECIDE she didnt like men.  it is a choice.  some choose to be straight, some gay.  some people like being outcasts, some like fitting in.  no one tells you to be gay, society tells you to be straight.  thats why i believe being gay is a choice.|`|UWsyqLrwaa	it's just like being a criminal, for example, some people choose to be like that even if it will make them an outcast in society, have less right than others, loose friends and family..<br>  It is wrong to me, but people have the right to choose what ever they want..It's their choice to sin, and we can't do much about it..|`|R1WapAO6aa	For those people asking for facts, you don't really need facts in my opinion.

And some of those who don't keep giving this bullshit argument of "just because you didn't choose it, doesn't mean you shouldn't fight it". Sin is doing wrong of your own free will. Homosexuality has nothing to do with free will. Therefore it is not a sin, end of story.<br>  <br>  If homosexuals choose to be that way, why have some of them attempted to commit suicide over the way they're treated?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsMkM2sEXNE&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsMkM2sEX...</a><br>  <br>  Let's hear an explanation for this?|`|NSXChygtaa	You may have not been born with what your attracted to, but you surely have free will to choose what you do with your goods.|`|52cdjmbQaa	A lot do (I said a lot, not most, or all), that's why there some programs out there to help "pray the gay away".|`|wPNtVytKaa	Do Homosexuals really believe that all Christians think this?|`|VJN6Bvloaa	goddidit<br>  <br>  wait no...<br>  <br>  sindidit!!|`|Pj85ehE1aa	Fundamentalist Christians attack the act of homosexuality based on passages from the bible.  That's funny that they seem to ignore Jesus Christ's little bit about "love thy neighbor" and "he who is without sin cast the first stone."  Or what about the other abominations like shell fish, pork, and wearing a polyester cotton blend mantle?  NO ONE is holier than anyone else.  I grew up Mormon, and the Mormon church recently used a lot of money (I'm guessing from tithing faithful members paid to the church) to pass the hateful proposition 8 in California.  Mormons believe that homosexuals choose to be gay.  The majority of fundamentalists do as well.  I left the church when I was old enough to think for myself and saw from an outside point of view how screwed up everything really was.  I'm so disappointed in the Mormon church. for spending Millions of dollars to get Proposition 8 passed when they could have spent it on humanitarian efforts or something beneficial to society.   I believe homosexuals are born the way they are.  My cousin is gay.  He hasn't come out of the closet yet because I know my aunt and uncle will disown him and treat him badly.  It's been obvious since he was very little.  I knew he was gay all his life.  That brings me to believe the scientific evidence that homosexuals are born gay.  I hate how Christians pick and choose what laws they want to follow in the bible.  Don't get all holy and mighty on homosexuality when one isn't practicing what they preach..<br>  <br>  Why are women allowed to speak in church?  the bible is very clear it is forbidden.  <br>  1 Corinthians 14 33-35:<br>  "33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.  As in all the congregations of the saints, 34 women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. 35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."<br>  <br>  Why are women allowed to leave their houses while menstruating?<br>  Leviticus 15:19  <br>  "And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even."<br>  <br>  Why are we allowing the handicapped or disfigured people in church?<br>  Leviticus<br>  21:17  Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.  (21:16-23)<br>  God can't stand the sight of handicapped people.<br>  The blind, the lame, dwarfs, people with funny noses or blemishes, with damaged testicles, or broken hands or feet, crooked backs, or who have scurvy or scabs, or who have anything superfluous must not approach the altar of God.<br>  21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,<br>  21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,<br>  21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;<br>  21:21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.<br>  21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.<br>  21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. " <br>  <br>  There are so many others abominations like this in the bible, but people choose what they will and instantly become better than anyone else.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Most people don't truly understand what others go through. Ever hear about that saying "walking a mile in another man's [sic] shoes?"<br>  <br>  People can no more choose to be homosexual than can they choose to be heterosexual or anything in between. Why would anyone choose to be gay? There are no consolation prizes. Rather, gays and lesbians can be fired from their job, lose their apartment, have no implied inheritance rights, little legal protections, face ridicule and scorn, face vile hatred and castigation from the likes of Fred Phelps and Jerry Fallwell as well as every major religion. Who would choose that?<br>  <br>  As far as mores and morals, heterosexuals engage in far more sodomy than homosexuals. I do not see religious leaders calling for a ban on oral or anal sex. If those acts are the true foundation of your arguments, why did the fundies push for restrictions against same-sex marriages instead of a Constitutional amendment banning sodomy?<br>  <br>  Newt Gingrich, big supporter of DoMA and huge sodomite who cheated on his wife, who was undergoing treatment for cancer at the time, while pushing that legislation. Trent Lott was on his third marriage when pushing for that marriage protection. Gays have hurt the "institution of marriage?" Talk about morality!

For example, Mexicans can range from white skin, to George Lopez dark. Nonetheless, a racist would still hate the Mexican no matter what color he is. Also, Blacks can even range from white skin toned, (Colin Powell) to nearly Black, (Reggie Bush) and a racist could care less. Therefore, racism is usually formed because of an individual's shallow thinking, causing him or her to believe race is the determinant for behavior and negative characteristics, such as being unintelligent, committing crime, or eating certain foods, such as fried chicken or watermelon. As for me, I'm not racist at all. I know race doesn't determine behavior, and if I dislike someone, it wouldn't be because of race. I could never hate a group, especially if those people don't represent themselves as or behave as a group. We're all individuals.|`|RDeYnyxQaa	I think I am still racist, but it's not about skin colour.

Lots of good looking women, by far one of the best states for that.  There are more women than men.  One of the most fit cities (even with little activity for a couple months due to cold).  Lots of biking, hiking, water activities, etc.  Plenty of shopping.  Great art, museums, culture.  All kinds of different people. We like to party!  Great schools & education. Top of the line healthcare. <br>  <br>  Winter may be a downer, but you get used to it.  Cold is only relative to what you're used to.  When it hits 40 F after winter, we're in T-shirts and shorts.  When it hits 40 in California, they act like its zero.  Summer can be really hot also.  We get both extremes. It's beautiful up here. It's a large state, plenty to do and see.<br>  <br>  There's a reason we're on the top of many best of lists.  We love it here, but shhhhh!  It's our little secret!|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	I'm from Sturgeon Lake, Minnesota. You just get used to the cold just as you get used to the sometimes hot summers. It's like me saying why would you wanna live in Florida? It's for sure too damn hot there. I've always loved cold climates. I don't like the heating bill, but that comes with the territory.

"Gravitational" means "relating to gravity," and gravity is what keeps you on the Earth. The suffix "-alist" means "person who follows - or identifies with - that idea." <br>  <br>  So apparently, a "gravitationalist" is a person who identifies with gravity? Doesn't make much sense to me, but it's a cool-sounding word, anyway. That's probably all they were going for. A cool, scientific-sounding name that didn't really mean anything.

ybn6beqiaa	I know you probably dont want to hear this.. but it sounds like, for your own good, you need to say quiet about your sexuality just for now. If your dad is a major Christian, will he kick you out if he knows that his son is bisexual?<br>  There is just some cases where being in the closet is better than being out. Trust me, I know what it feels like.. having to keep that part of your life a secret from everyone (or at least your parents.) But I dont want to see you being kicked outta your house, your only 15. <br>  <br>  I'm bi too and I just came out to mt stepmum this week. Though I moved out a long time ago. I didnt know how she would react so I thought that was best.<br>  Please promise me you wont cut yourself again, okay? Cutting can get really addictive.. I should know.. You need to learn how to get your emotions out through another way. <br>  Maybe its better to stay in the closet at least till you move out, than if anything does go wrong, you can support yourself and you dont need to rely on them. <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose to do. <br>  *hugs*|`|u8CFwtyMaa	I was about 15 when I realised I was bi, and, to be honest, I never managed to come out to my parents. By the time I left home I was getting married, so the problem sort of went away. <br> If your dad has gay friends, it won't mean that he'll accept a bi son. My father in law is very racist, but idolises his half-cast granddaughter - he wouldn't let his daughter marry a coloured man. I think your dad could be the other way round. <br> If you think he might throw you out of the house, then I suggest you wait until you can support yourself before you tell him. Get to know his gay friends, they may be able to help you.<br> Hope this helps|`|7U0hQ1VPaa	Hi im a 15 year old gay male, and i didn't have to tell my parents they just knew, i just act like myself and i think that they guessed it. that's what i would do if i was you. and you said your dad has gay friends? well, maybe they will spot it for you and hint to your dad about it. email me if you wanna talk. <br>  good luck|`|ZxV8FeiYaa	I'm bi too, my parents are both really Christian and i get upset a lot too I've also found myself in a bit of a depression, my sister told my parents she was bi and they just laughed at her, so i haven't really told them much, I think once I go out with a girl for a while I'll just take her to meet them and "this is my girlfriend" and they'll have to except that,<br>  I also think they know deep down 'cause I do bring it up a far bit, and I've introduced them to some of my gay friends, the first one my parents got really upset that i even bought him into there home but once they've got to know him i think there really warming up<br>  I know this doesn't answer the question, just thought I'd share a bit of my journey with you, perhaps we could email and talk more?|`|gm9ctMB7aa	ok   please  stop  cutting yourself .   ive been  in  a similar  situarion  when  my  parents found out  i was  messing  around with  girls  and i  wound up in  a mental institution  so  please  dont  hurt  your self  if  u  have to    talk  to  someone  u  totally  trust   but  please i  almost lost my  daughter  by  cutting  so  plze plze think  befor u  cut. nothing  is worth it  and i  think  your parents  would  be  more  upset about u  cutting  then  u  being  bi.

fc10e84e3cb57eff42ec4b545a713e80aa	I judge people by their attitude.  The problem I have with some people is not the way they look but the way they behave.|`|cc1ba6b0728cacb0aa2b8c20c0cb48f6aa	Based solely on my past experience, I'd assume the well dressed guy was going to ask me for directions or something similar since well dressed people rarely speak to me.  I'd assume the "ghetto" guy was trying to hit on me.  Since I hate when strangers hit on me, I'd be more comfortable with the well dressed guy since I'd figure he really doesn't want to be talking to me anyway and he'll leave me alone as soon as I answer his question.  When I tell people that hit on me to leave me alone, they sometimes get angry and start harassing me.<br>  <br>  *The question was about being APPROACHED, not about how I feel when I look at random people.  I guess I get a 'thumbs down' for having 90% of men who approach me looking like that sexually harass me*|`|AA11384465	I dont|`|1dd0fd6eefe1bb904ef11f24c409f384aa	Every one does to a certain degree...not everyone acts on it.  Just basic human nature.|`|AA10802712	Depends. I try not to judge people on clothes they wear, because you never know if someone is just dressing up because they had an interview that day, but for real they are a slob and broke and never really consider dressing nice. Or the person that is looking all baggy and slobby could just be incognito or in hiding or undercover for a job or something. You just can't look at someone's clothes and say you are what you wear. And as for which one I would feel more comfortable with would depend on how long I knew either guy that dressed either way. Cuz like I said with the one guy that may look nice, he could be a total jerk and be high maintenance, while the baggy guy could have a great personality and just can't afford to look as nice. Have to really go beyond what your eyes see. Cuz if not you will always get screwed in the end.|`|a6fb9e3b4b36140457cf47f4a011ba37aa	Yes, we all judge people by how they look, whether or not we realize it.<br>  <br>  I don't know what a prat is, but I can say this - no educated, respectable man would walk around in a huge shirt with pants hanging off his ***. Nor would he go out in public looking "ghetto." <br>  <br>  People dress to represent who they are (maybe except work clothing.)  We all need to realize that.|`|a8a662e7463750914a9ddc122025f632aa	i try very hard  not to judge people by thier clothing first of all. i look them in the eye and judge them by thier behaviors and how they react to me when i speak to them. i am most uncomfortable around those who are unwilling to look me square in the eyes. something a little shady about that.|`|03c61062fa01d1017b890dcd7c211b88aa	The ghetto perosn cos he probably likes the same music as me and he's got a totally good style.

f2f082f5e532bf2ba84b0a7708eda532aa	!Qué pasadas que juega la sexualidad a veces!: cuando creías que lo tenías todo definido en ese aspecto, aparecen las situaciones más complicadas. Bueno, debo empezar diciendo que esa es una la sexualidad no es un ámbito que conozcamos como la palma de nuestra mano, hay zonas inexploradas, que de repente, como en esta ocasión, se manifiestan de una manera inesperada o inpensada. Y tal vez por eso creamos que son "confusiones", pero en relidad creo que en la sexualidad todo está permitido, siempre y cuando lo desees y la persona involucrada también. Y si tú deseas estar con tu amiga, creo que no hay muchos inconvenientes por ese lado. Incluso no me parece un inconveniente que a ella le gusten los chicos...  <br>  Yo pienso que lo complicado está en que ella es tu amiga, ya que si no tratas con mucho tacto el tema con ella, puedes echar a perder la amistad. que es lo que debe perdurar sobre todo.<br>  Por lo demás, puedo decir que alguna vez a todos nos ha pasado eso de estar enamorados y sentir la necesidad de decírselo a la persona, y la mejor solución, creo, es decirlo. Y al final de cuentas, tú misma lo dijiste, amor es amor,  ?no?<br>  Creo que debes decirle que te has empezado a sentir atraída por ella y que, en nombre de la gran amistad que las une, has decidido ser sincera con ella. Y bueno, el resto, depende de eso. Espero que todo salga bien...|`|ff9bfe666187fcd68445d1bb34a9f411aa	hace como tres a?os me enamore de mi mejor amiga, era la primera vez q yo sentia algo por una chava, paso mucho tiempo para q las dos nos dijieramos algo pero nuestra relacion no era igual q con nuestras otras dos amigas, de repente empece a sentir demaciados celos por cualquier persona q se le pudiera acercar pues yo queria ser esa persona, nunca nos dijimos las cosas directas hasta q un dia ella me beso en mi cuarto pero todo fue demaciado rapido y me sco demaciado de onda, luego de todo eso comenzamos con una relacion tuvo cosas muy padres y aprendi muchas cosas mas, por ciertos motivos terminamos y yo me quede con la esperanza de q un dia volveria hasta q me entere q se volvio cristiana y ya tenia una pareja estable, fue uno de los momentos mas dificiles de mi vida pues yo habia entregado muchas cosas empezando por contarle parte de mi familia lo q paso con ella.<br>  Al final despues de muchas cosas donde siguio lastimandome un dia se contacto conmigo y volvimos a platicar de las cosas q ocurrieron y te soy honesta nunca volvera ser igual arruinamos una amistad de 4 a?os, no solo perdi a mi novia, sino a mi mejor amiga.<br>  ahora estamos en proceso de recuperar la amistad pero ha sido muy dificil ya cada una de las dos tenemos una pareja estable.<br>  Yo te aconsejo q valores y tomes en cuenta el q puedes perder no solo a una pareja sino a tu mejor amiga si estas dispuesta a jugarte estas dos cosas adelante.<br>  Sino mejor trata de conocer a otras chavas donde realmente puedes encontrar a el amor de tu vida como me paso a mi.<br>  <br>  Espero a verte ayudado|`|j5EimXleaa	yo estube enamorada de mi amiga pero ella nunca habia tenido ningun tipo de relasiones con ninguna mujer bueno yo le hasia como cosas no directas pero era para q ella supiera q me interesaba bueno no pasaba nada y un dia no aguante mas y la llame por telefono y le dije mis sentimientos hacia ella pero ella me dijo q ella no era asi q era mejor q fueramos amigas pero yo no me di por bencida con mis tratos como yo era de especial con ella un dia estabamos sola en su cualto y yo vi la mirada q ella me dio hay me di de cuenta q ella tambien sentia algo por mi y segui insistiendo y al fin un dia me dio el si,uno nunca se puede dar por vencida, con ella yo dure 2 anos y fue la mejor relacion de mi vida por q aparte de ser parejas nos llevavamos como muy buenas amigas.|`|374ykaaraa	Si sois buenas amigas, tienes que ser sincera con ella, lo entenderá, y si no lo entiende no sois tan buenas amigas y por lo tanto deberias distanciarte.<br>  Parte de la base de que tu ya sabes que lo vuestro es bastante dificil, porque a ella le gustan los chicos, pero si te lo guardas eliminas cualquier posibilidad, ademas si se entera de otro modo, seguro que no lo entiende.<br>  Vamos que yo creo que la sinceridad es la mejor opcion en cualquier caso, y si las cosas no salen bien y ella no te entiende o se enfada, o se distancia, será mejor de esa manera, para que puedas olvidarla y seguir adelante.<br>  Tranquila, las cosas con el tiempo se tranquilizan, mejoran y las heridas se curan, pero se optimista.<br>  Besos!|`|jMxK7UKVaa	hola amiga, mira con mi ex pareja tuvimos muchas relaciones de bisexualidad tanto femeninas como masculinas, creo que  con respeto y honestidad tendrias  que manifestarlo, busca de quedar  solas, que te ayude a ponerte una prenda, a mirar un video juntas donde existan esas relacion y  besala,  solo besala, decile que tenes una intriga que mostrale y  pedile que cierre sus ojos, apolla  tus  lavios en los de ella y deja que  ella  haga lo que quiera,  deja que fluya, besos|`|3c0d53d0659600700686b93f862c8dceaa	Si es tu mejor amiga, te va a entender... sólo explícale las cosas, cómo te sientes, etc, etc, etc. tampoco te le lances, digo... la neta creo que se espantaría.

El que no arriesga no gana,  <br>  <br>  Si ella ya te ha expresado su confución respecto a su preferencia sexual, tal vez no sea tan dificil crear la situación en donde se pueda dar un acercamiento. <br>  <br>  Si queres preparar el camino inicia por cosas peque?as que no harias regularmente, como al pasar por su lado y no haya nadie, acariciar su brazo como con un roce y provocar contacto visual, vean un pelicula y muy casualmente recostate en su hobro, su estomago o sus piernas y muy despacio y como sin querer acariciala, hacele cari?itos muy suaves pero no del tipo que dos amigas se haria, sino del tipo que una pareja se haria. Podes ir creando ese ambiente por un par de días antes de llegar a concretar algo, asegurandote de no asustarla.  Si ella no reacciona negativamente o alejandose entonces podes ser un poco mas agresiva e intentar ya concretar algo.  Pero si ella se aleja o reacciona negativamente, podes dar un paso atras, ya que no hay nada hecho que no se pueda reparar para intentar otra cosa o dejarla por la paz.  Cuando te digo que podes ser mas agresiva, me refiero a ser mas directa, como durante ese tiempo que apartes para crear esas situaciones, insisto ver peliculas es lo mejor, ya que pueden estar recostadas en el sillon o en la cama y propiciar el acercamiento mas sutilmente, entonces una vez ya cubierto lo que te describi arriba, ya podes comenzar a acerarte a sus hombros y darle un beso (en el hombro)  o acariciar su cuello, como tip una de las partes del curpo donde la mujer se erotiza mas profundamente es el vientre bajo, asi que si podes hacer un poco de presion en esa area mientras le haces cari?itos lo mas seguro es que para cuando intentes besarla ella ya lo va a estar esperando y deseando.<br>  <br>  Otra forma de acercarte es hablando con ella y sincerandote. Decile lo que sentis y que queres intentar una relación con ella y que aunque sabes que suena extra?o y dificil te encantaria la oportunidad de empezar algo.  Cuando le hables procura estar cara a cara, mirarla a los ojos, no como un reto, sino lo suficiente para que ella sepa que estas siendo honesta, toma su mano y si las cosas van bien intenta acercarte y darle un beso.  Aveses dar el primer paso es lo que mas cuesta y si ella esta muy nerviosa seguramente no lo hara, pero vos tenes el tiempo para agarrar valor.<br>  <br>  Recorda que simpre corres el riesgo de perder la amistad de una persona cuando das a conocer estos sentimientos.  Si ella te entiende y corresponde, bueno, estas hecha, pero si no te corresponde puede que o te brinde su amistad o que te la retire y no hay formula magica para saber que va a pasar.  Vos la conoces más que ninguno de nosotr@s y solo vos sabes si estas lista para ese paso o no.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte!|`|BgFmg9WHaa	La verdad es un tema muy delicado, ya que no es cualquier chica... sino tu mejor amiga.<br>  Creo que si la conoces bien debes saber si ella siente lo mismo que vos. Ojo porque del amor al odio hay un solo paso... no metas la pata, antes de hablar con ella debes estar bien segura. Vos pusiste que no te pasa con todas las chicas sino con ella nada mas... creo que eso es solo una confusión, es amar demasiado a una persona y eso te desorienta.<br>  Trata de conseguirte un novio que te guste y te llame la atencion, y si despues de un tiempo seguis pensando en ella (teniendo novio) creo que ahi podés repreguntarte si de verdad te gustan las mujeres.<br>  Saludos... espero haberte podido ayudar.|`|FxLg2iNLaa	Pues primero que nada disfruta su compa?ía al máximo cada minuto, porque no sabes cuanto va a durar tu amistad. Si a tu amiga no le interesan las chicas, pues vas a tener que ser fuerte y aceptarlo.<br>  <br>  Tendrías que hacer que se entere que te has enamorado de ella, no es necesario que se lo digas directamente, sólo hazle saber todo lo que serías capaz de hacer por ella. <br>  <br>  La prueba definitiva es que trates de tener contacto físico con ella, si te rechaza, pues entonces es un amor imposible, pero si cede poco a poco, pues entonces tienes esperanzas.<br>  <br>  Pero lo más importante es que disfrutes a esa persona mientras esté cerca de ti, cuídala y consientela mucho.|`|QurwDNv5aa	No sé.

Claro que si crees que tienes alguna posibilidad con ella, tal vez te convenga probar y desenga?arte... o ser feliz si funciona.|`|7996438d55e6638c924accf5c4c21c64aa	ataca, pero ya....|`|67570093cc9f90c0138e60e2e89bf69caa	Tanto para heterosexuales como homosexuales el amor es arriesgarse, por lo que comentas creo que es una atracción, no es que seas lesbiana ni bisexual, eso ocurre en diferentes etapas de la vida, no te sientas mal.

Te deseo salgas sin tantas heridas y digo tantas porque el amor no nos deja inmaculados.|`|AA11101704	Hola! Sabes, lo mismo me pasó a mí con mi mejor amiga. Te cuento rapidito. Ella fue mi mejor amiga desde la prepa, y ya en la universidad yo salí del closet con ella y el resto de mis amigos. Al igual que tú, yo estaba enamoradísima de esta chava. Empezé dandole peque?as pistas de que me gustaba, aunque nunca nada serio ni drástico, tampoco la quería asustar. Siempre ella y yo teníamos pijamadas y dormíamos en la misma cama pero nunca pasaba nada, no me atrevía. Hasta que llegó un momento en que no aguanté más, y en una de esas pijamadas (jaja) me animé e inicié algo, y eso fue el principio de muchas noches como esa. De ahí nació una relación que iba mas allá de la amistad. A ella le gustaban los hombres, de hecho andaba conmigo y con un chavo al mismo tiempo, en lo que se definía. Claro que esto a mí me dolía, pero cada quien haciendo su lucha y al final de cuentas se quedó conmigo. Tuvimos una relación seria, estable y monógoma por 2 a?os. Nos separamos porque ella terminó la uni y se fue a otra ciudad, a mí todavía me faltaba un a?o para terminar. <br>  <br>  Con esto te digo que no hay nada imposible. No pierdes nada con decirle a tu amiga lo que sientes por ella, creeme que te sentirás mucho mejor contigo misma si lo haces. <br>  <br>  Te deseo lo mejor!!!|`|YrF4FmtMaa	MIRA ES BASTANTE DIFICIL, YO ESTUVE ENAMORADO DE MI MEJOR AMIGO, ME SENTIA MUY MAL, ME`PASABA COMO A TI, NO DEJABA DE PENSAR EN EL, HASTA QUE UNA VEZ ME DIJO QUE EL SENTIA INSEGURIDAD EN SU SEXUALIDAD, SIENTO QUE INTENTO DECIRME ALGO, ASI QUE YO AL FIN LE CONFESE QUE YO ESTABA ENAMORADO DE EL.

PyNhX4pIaa	Aunque hoy por hoy eso no va a suceder, de ser real, sería un mundo mucho mejor.<br>  Hay que tener en cuenta de que hablamos de personas que han vivido muy de cerca la intolerancia de los demás. Que aún hoy en día se pone en tela de juicio si pueden casarse o no y si tienen derecho a los bienes de su pareja. Pasarán aún muchos a?os antes de que todo esto quede atrás. <br>  Por otro lado un único gobierno para todas las naciones todavía nos queda muy, muy grande. Si no somos capaces ni de asistir a una cumbre y no acabar a guantazos, imagina ponernos de acuerdo para elegir un lider mundial.Vamos.<br>  En fín, si fuera real. Sería fantastico o no. Porque eso demostraría que todos nos hemos vuelto lo suficientemente tolerantes para respetarnos a nosotros mismos y respetar a los demás. Respetar desde el ni?o peque?o al anciano, pasando por el drogata de la esquina. Y lamentablemente vivimos en una sociedad que tiene que hacer mucho por sanarse a sí misma. Y quizás si consiguieramos sanarnos no necesitaríamos que nadie nos dirigiera, por que todos seríamos conscientes de nuestra misión con lo cual sería tan sencillo como hacer lo que debemos.<br>  Un saludo.|`|2OyurVeVaa	seria un mundo sin verdaderas normas y podrías hacer lo q querríamos y cada cosa tendría su condición<br>  aunque algunos sean muy ordenados y muy|`|EhIwXVW4aa	Sería un mundo lleno de amor,muy ordenado de mucha hermandad ,comprensión ,pq ellos saben lo que es ser discriminados,ayudarían a todo el mundo sin importar género,posición social ,etc....|`|I5TBEwY4aa	de colores como el ARCOIRIS AjajaJAja<br>  <br>  la verdad no creo que sucedaaa pronto ejejje<br>  <br>  <br>  apenas y el mundoo los estan aceptando...<br>  <br>  no tengo nada en contra de ellos... tengo un amigo que es gay y es super buena ondaaa...|`|QoYdmCALaa	Creo q lo unico q cambiaria serian las leyes a favor del casamiento entre gays y de ese tipo de leyes.

PmdCvSctaa	"The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or within easy reach of a metropolis – because that's where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are. He might be officially gay, straight or bisexual, but this is utterly immaterial because he has clearly taken himself as his own love object and pleasure as his sexual preference. Particular professions, such as modeling, waiting tables, media, pop music and, nowadays, sport, seem to attract them but, truth be told, like male vanity products and herpes, they're pretty much everywhere."<br>  <br>      "For some time now, old-fashioned (re)productive, repressed, unmoisturized heterosexuality has been given the pink slip by consumer capitalism. The stoic, self-denying, modest straight male didn't shop enough (his role was to earn money for his wife to spend), and so he had to be replaced by a new kind of man, one less certain of his identity and much more interested in his image – that's to say, one who was much more interested in being looked at (because that's the only way you can be certain you actually exist). A man, in other words, who is an advertiser's walking wet dream."<br>  <br>  <br>  Both of the above definitions originate from Mark Simpson's Salon.com<br>  <br>  <br>  A meterosexual man, basically, cares and puts a great deal of effort into his appearance. He may get his eyebrows as well as other parts of his body waxed, he may get manicures/pedicures and frequent the hair salon, it is also likely that he knows a good deal about fashion or is an avid trend follower. He often enjoys shopping as well. He is, by society's standards, quite feminine - deviating from the stereotypical "macho man" straight guy.|`|nRNsmYZuaa	Metrosexual is a neologism generally applied to heterosexual men with a strong concern for their appearance, or whose lifestyles display attributes stereotypically seen among gay men. Metrosexualism is closely related to Dandyism. Debate surrounds the term's use as a theoretical signifier of gender deconstruction and its associations with consumerism. The word was coined as a tongue-in-cheek play on "heterosexual".<br>  <br>  |`|Hxp3ed35aa	It's a straight man who doesn't fit the typical definition of masculine.  <br>  <br>  - great fashion sense<br>  - interest in cooking, gourmet food, wine<br>  - take care of their bodies by working out, getting manicures, using lotions<br>  - some people might think he's gay but he's not<br>  - would rather go to the theatre than a football game<br>  - sensitive to other people's feelings<br>  - notices other peoples clothing, hair styles, etc.<br>  |`|8NvX46RNaa	Its like everything else.

Metrosexuals are males who pay special attention to their fashion. They can be straight or gay, it's completely independent of sexual orientation.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	A normally straight male who possesses qualities of a gay male without being attracted to men. A metro often appreciates the finer things in life and enjoys making himself look good; be it through styling his hair or wearing fashionable clothes. <br>  <br>  <br>  A man who is emotionally sensitive and aware, verbal and communicative, physically fit, clean, has manners, smells good, and often enjoys fashion, beauty products, entertaining, and interior design. A metrosexual has a sophisticated aesthetic and often a well developed feminine side. Because of the metrosexual's expression of what are considered in the U.S. traditional female characteristics, metrosexuals are often mistaken for closeted gays. <br>

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Hai ragione, ce ne sono. Noi li chiamiamo "dialetti," però si capiscono benissimo (non come voi, che uno parla neopolitano e uno parla friulano e non capiscono un cavolo).<br>  <br>  Puoi leggere un po' sugli accenti regionali americani: <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglese_americano#Accenti_regionali_dell.27inglese_americano" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglese_ame...</a><br>  <br>  Magari puoi anche cercare su YouTube a trovare come suonano.|`|GliXWjK1aa	Sì|`|BIKOo8CIaa	beh si...allora la storia degli accenti all'interno della lingua inglese è questa: ogni nazione che parla inglese ha un accento diverso facilmente riconoscibile per chi parla bene la lingua (più che altro per chi è abituato ad ascoltarla): britannico (che comprende quindi i vari accenti nazionali inglese, scozzese, irlandese e del galles), australiano, giamaicano, canadese, della nuova zelanda, indiano, e molti altri tra i quali spicca per numero di parlanti l'inglese americano.<br>  <br>  All'interno dell'inglese che si parla negli stati uniti ci sono moltissime varietà geograficamente distribuite (est, ovest, sud e nord). All'interno di queste grandissime fette ci sono poi quelli degli stati particolari (al sud l'accento texano è diverso da quello dell'alabama per esempio). E ovviamente all'interno del solito stato ci sono le varie parlate diverse per ogni città. se poi si vuole scendere ancora di più nel particolare, in ogni città ci sono i vari accenti e slang di ogni piccola o grande comunità. A new york ci sono ad esempio decine di accenti diversi a seconda della zona (manhattan, brooklyn, queens, quartieri italiani, ispanici, cinesi, indiani, ...). e questo vale per tutte le città degli stati uniti (io ho diretta esperienza per quanto riguarda boston - che ha uno degli accenti meglio riconoscibili di tutti gli usa - perchè i miei nonni materni vivono la: c'è la parlata di chi ha origini irlandesi, italiane, ecc...).<br>  <br>  La differenza tra l'italia e gli stati uniti è che qui da noi chi parla italiano con un accento straniero viene considerato come una persona che parla semplicemente male l'italiano, mentre negli stati uniti, per quanto magari la pronuncia di un parlante di origini messicane non sia l'inglese canonico, quello che lui parla è comunque considerato una delle tante varietà di inglese presente negli stati uniti, non una lingua parlata male.<br>  <br>  Per questo motivo, l'inglese americano, molto più dell'inglese così detto "della regina" britannico, si presenta come una lingua adatta ad essere parlata da tutto il mondo: perchè dà l'idea (e poi così è in realtà) che possa essere parlata (e arricchita) da tutti. Da questo poi derivano anche tante "cattive abitudini" se così vogliamo chiamarle degli americani degli stati uniti, come ad esempio la scarsa capacità di sentire un posto come casa propria, ma queste sono solo miei personali idee che non è il caso di discutere in questa domanda...|`|cCeXkvuIaa	decine e decine...<br>  alcune come quella newyorkese o quelle del sud sono facilmente riconoscibili anche da noi italiani.<br>  (prova ad ascoltare Al Pacino in lingua originale)|`|DwKLP4cEaa	 un cittadino della california e uno di New York fanno fatica a capirsi. |`|FLA57GnWaa	ovvio|`|35cySZ5caa	si è vero, l'anno scorso sono andata negli stati uniti. Sono andata a Virginia Beach e ho compreso circa solamente 50%, ma dopo sono andata in New York e ho compreso circa tutto. Penso che è la stessa cosa con tutte le lingue. |`|uZ87HrW5aa	Certo! Basta spostarsi pochissimo che già cambiano, magari noi nemmeno lo notiamo..<br>  Se poi pensi che l'italia è minuscola in confronto pensa li quanti accenti ci sono in proporzione..|`|cNLuHxOEaa	guarda che lo stesso succede in Inghilterra  ci sono decine di accenti, e anche dialetti...|`|deCAII4maa	si, come in tutti i paesi del mondo. <br>  sapevo anche che quelli del sud vengono presi un pò in giro perché parlano mooooolto lentamente. |`|QQLxtThVaa	si come in tutte le nazioni

53d173cf8196283c2c28f9c0efc29f92aa	Example: <br>  The man sees you. = Der Mann sieht dich.<br>  You see the man = Du siehst den Mann.<br>  <br>  Any complete sentence consists of at least one noun (the man)  or pronoun (You) in the Nominative case and one conjugated verb (sees/see).<br>   In these instances there is also a direct object in the Accusative (you/ the man). It denotes the direct object or aim of the action described by the verb.<br>   In English there is no separate object form for "you" as there is for other pronouns (me, him, her, etc).<br>  The additional difficulty with German is that it has two objective forms, the accusative for the direct object "dich" and the dative case for the indirect object which in English is often expressed with the prepositional "to you" ("dir").<br>  <br>  A very easy, but not very precise rule of thumb is to use "dich"(accusative) whenever you could use "her, him" (without any preposition) as a pronoun in the third person.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	You're not stupid!

"Dich" goes at the ends of phrases, and "Du" starts phrases. The same goes for "Mich" and "Ich," too.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Fill in all the gaps you can possibly find, that's how to write a nice, big essay.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself these questions:<br>  <br>  How does it surround people? In what forms does it take? Are there more billboards than newspapers, or maybe more magazines than TV shows? How is it a part of people's daily life?<br>  <br>  Also, your intro paragraph should contain your main idea and supporting evidence. A good essay has a main point, followed by details that back it up. <br>  <br>  So, maybe you want to write your essay on how the media is everywhere. Well, you've said that in your first sentence, so people will assume that's what the essay's going to be about. Now all you have to do is find some details that can back up why/how/where/when media is everywhere. The first paragraph after your intro could be about what kinds of media there are. Your second paragraph could be about where these media usually are. See how I'm doing this? :)<br>  <br>  Also, for your text citations, try using your class textbook. That's usually the easiest way to cite something.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions about how you're supposed to write your essay, please ask your teacher! That's what they're there for, and hey - it's your grade, so why just sit there?|`|a0J7LlP0aa	Try something like this:<br>  "Media is also a way to reach remote areas, is a powerful tool of communication that integrates communities, countries and the whole world.

RoHjjzXWaa	"Sta scendendo una nebbia fitta"<br>  sta scendendo = present continuous of "scendere"<br>  scendere = to come down<br>  <br>  nebbia = fog<br>  fitta = thick<br>  <br>  You could also say "sta scendendo una bella nebbia"<br>  In this case "bella" is not used meaning "beautiful", but stands for "big, noteworthy".<br>  <br>  @Kelly: "Una nebbia pesante arriva" is not totally incorrect, but it would not be used in daily communication. First of all, putting the verb at the end of the sentence makes it sound poetic - normally, you would say "sta arrivando + subject". Then, we say that "la nebbia" (the fog) "scende" (from scendere, to come down), or even "sale" (from sailre, to come up), but not "arriva". "Arrivare", when it comes to weather, can be used with "un temporale", "un acquazzone", "una tempesta","del maltempo" (different ways to say "storm"), but not with "nebbia".<br>  "Pesante" is not incorrect, and works when talking about "nuvole" (=coluds), but again, I've never heard it used with fog. Common terms for fog are "fitta", "densa", "spessa" (different ways to say "thick").|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	I would say "Una nebbia pesante arriva," which translates as "A heavy fog is arriving." But I'm not a native speaker, so perhaps there's a better phrase I don't know.<br>  <br>  Edit: If an Italian speaker could tell me why my answer is wrong, I would really appreciate it. Can you just not use "pesante" with clouds...?<br>  <br>  @ ficie: Grazie infinite!|`|XzSsclTbaa	its more like THERE IS A THICK FOG..if its coming down right now u can say "C'e' una fitta nebbia" and if the thick fog is coming like tomorrow u can say "e prevista una fitta nebbia per domani"

But I would describe my accent as the Midwestern Non-Accent, aka Standard American that you hear on the TV. An interesting fact I heard from someone though (I live in Colorado), I say "Colo-ra-do" ("ra" as in "rattle") but someone truly from the Midwest says "Colo-rah-do" ("rah" as in "bra"). So, I'm not sure what the "ra" says about my accent, but I don't quite fit in even amongst Midwesterners. ;)<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|39rXZUeQaa	I really don't know. I live in Tennessee so everybody from other areas tells me I have a Southern accent. Some people like it, but just as many can't stand it.

Also the way they speak is very polite.  The least pleasing is hands down the Boston accent.  Other accents like New York, Tennessee and New England are easy to spot and other's are less distinct.  African American's kinda have their own regional accents too.<br>  <br>  Canadians say Zed and Americans say Zee.  In Ontario we don't have strong accents and we pronounce things more clearly.   English speaking people in Quebec all have a slight French accent. The Maritimes have strong accents that strong origins in Ireland and Scotland.  The Caribbean islands also have distinct individual accents.<br>  <br>  I'm a bit of an accent camelleon.  It changes when I'm in anyplace for any length of time and I pick up local accents on vacation.  I switch between French Canadian and European French accents when I need to.  Speaking with a French Canadian accent in France is about as understood as speaking English with a Scotish accent in Tennessee.  BTW, I learned German with French people living in Germany and what little I speak I'm told has a French accent.

SF1uPJZhaa	Yes, it's "I'd like to see you again"<br>  But "wider" is actually spelled "wieder" (= again).|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	It's standard German, not Swiss German. Swiss German sounds very different from standard German. Example:<br>  <br>  Standard German: Ich habe mich verirrt. ("I'm lost.")<br>  Swiss German: I bi velore. ("I'm lost.") <br>  <br>  Anyway, the phrase means "I would like to see you again." <br>  <br>  du = you<br>  ich = I<br>  m?chte = would like<br>  dich = you<br>  wieder = see<br>  sehen = again <br>  <br>  So, du (you) ich m?chte (I would like) dich wieder sehen (to see you again). The extra "you" at the beginning is added for emphasis.<br>  <br>  The difference between "du" and "dich" is like the difference between "I" and "me." One starts phrases, the other goes at the ends of phrases. Because English evolved from German, we have some of the same grammatical rules. And the compound word "wiedersehen" comes from the phrase "auf wiedersehen," which means "goodbye," or more literally, "until the time when we see each other again."|`|AA12189772	If I remember my German right, it means "I'd like to see you again."<br>  <br>  I think "wider" is spelled wrong, it should be "wieder."  Think of the phrase "Auf Wiedersehen," which, while usually translated as "goodbye" really means "until we meet again."|`|GGX2s1S9aa	"I would like to see you again"<br>  <br>  <br>  I speak German but not swiss german...so... =/

PJFfenDMaa	If you had to drop out, you won't have all the math you need.  If you take the G.E.D, you still will only have minimal math skills.  You will have to go to a junior college for the first two years where they will probably test you so they can place you in the appropriate math class.  It may take you a little longer than usual to graduate with this degree because you will have some making up to do.  After 2 years, you will be able to transfer to a 4-year university.  Make sure your grades are REALLY good!!!  You may also want to think about getting a Master's Degree in the future, if you want to teach.  <br>  <br>  For now, you should definitely go speak with a counselor at either the high school, or a junior college...or both.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Go to the school counselor at your high school, and tell them you want to get back into school and see what advice they can give you, based on your situation. <br>  <br>  Not having a college degree is one thing, but you should at least graduate from high school.

Kanji is a writing system. You speak Japanese. You'll say the word "nihongo" no matter if you write it with kanji or hiragana.|`|MZFIJf1zaa	There isn't a difference because they're both writing systems and there isn't a difference when speaking.|`|3670LE9baa	You don't "speak" in any of those ways.  They are different forms of *writing*.  Hiragana is the Japanese phonetic alphabet.  Kanji (meaning literally "Han Characters") are Chinese characters, which are usually used in combination with hiragana.<br>  <br>  You can write in hiragana or kanji, the key difference being that hiragana is read totally phonetically, while kanji can have different readings depending on their context.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  You can write "otoko no hito" in hriagana as おとこのひと or with kanji as 男の人 (notice that it still uses hiragana "no") and they are exactly the same thing.  (But using kanji makes you look more educated.)<br>  <br>  (Also be aware of Katakana which is a secondary phonetic alphabet.  The difference between hiragana and katakana is *kind of* like the difference between lower- and uppercase in English.  Katakana is usually used for spelling foreign words, but can also be used to spell native Japanese words for emphasis.)|`|vNejfi6vaa	I think you mean difference in writing? If you write a sentence in hiragana and then in Kanji, a Japanese person will read both of them without any difference, because Japanese can be written entirely in Hiragana/Katakana or in a mix of kana and kanji, which is normal.<br>  <br>  So I think you mean difference in writing in kanji. you need to learn 1945 commonly used kanji to write and use them in your day-to-day Japanese.

I'm only a beginner in Mandarin, so I'm using a dictionary for most of this. Here's what it's giving me:<br>  <br>  我 (wǒ) = I<br>  好 (hǎo) = very much<br>  愛 (ài) = to love<br>  還有 (hái yǒu) = also / furthermore<br>  姊姊 (zǐ zǐ) = older sister<br>  買 (mǎi) = to buy<br>  的 (de) = descriptive particle linking to a noun<br>  蛋糕 (dàn gāo) = cake<br>  還有 (hái yǒu) = also / furthermore<br>  被 (bèi) = by<br>  誇獎 (kuā jiǎng) = to praise / to compliment <br>  好 (hǎo) = very much<br>  有 (yǒu) = there is<br>  內涵 (nèi hán) = meaning<br>  我 (wǒ) = I<br>  真是 (zhēn shì) = it is truly<br>  好 (hǎo) = very much<br>  害羞 (hài xiū) = to blush / to be shy<br>  <br>  @ chy5398p: Your condescension makes me feel really warm and fuzzy inside. I'm glad your six years of Mandarin have made you the person you are today. I'm fully aware of how to translate, as I've studied Italian for seven years (one year more, I might add, than you've studied Mandarin). Even if I've only been studying for two months, do you dare b*tch at me about how to translate.|`|SeTu5q7iaa	There are many ways to translate from Chinese to English and vice versa, but it has to make sense to everybody while retaining the meaning of the sentence as a whole. What Kelly, one of “top contributors”, did was a word-to-word translation. I strongly do not recommend her as she is only a beginner in Mandarin Chinese. Also, relying purely on word-to-word translation can sometimes create a situation where the sentence is “lost in translation.” So the next time you need to ask somebody about the meaning of a sentence, I suggest you to find somebody who is fluent in your native language and his/her native language at the same time for many years. It doesn’t have to be from “top contributors”, as they may not always be reliable.<br>  <br>  I personally do agree with most of what Kelly have defined in each word, but many vocabularies of Chinese language, like English, can have many meanings, depending on how a person use it. But here is a list of better definition for each word:<br>  <br>  我 (wǒ) = I, me<br>  好 (hǎo) = good (adjective), very (adverb)<br>  愛 (ài) = (to) love (verb), love (noun), (to) like (with more positive connotation)<br>  還有 (hái yǒu) = also, furthermore<br>  姊姊 (zǐ zǐ) = older sister<br>  買 (mǎi) = (to) buy, (to) purchase<br>  的 (de) = descriptive particle linking to a noun<br>  蛋糕 (dàn gāo) = cake<br>  被 (bèi) = by (marker for passive-voice sentences or clauses); quilt; blanket; (to) cover; (to) wear<br>  誇獎 (kuā jiǎng) = (to) praise, (to) compliment, (to) applaud<br>  有 (yǒu) = have (present tense, plural, expect the use for “I” and “you” in singular), has (present tense, singular), had (past tense and past participle)<br>  內涵 (nèi hán) = intention, connotation, ability of exercising self-control, self-restraint<br>  真是 (zhēn shì) = really, truly<br>  害羞 (hài xiū) = blush, shy<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is the translation of your submitted sentence:<br>  <br>  Chinese: OMG,我好愛Prime,還有姊姊買的蛋糕,還有被誇獎好有內涵,我真是好害羞.....<br>  <br>  English: Oh, my goodness! I really love Prime as well as the cake bought by my older sister. I even get compliments from somebody with (positive) intention. I really don’t know what to say (the reaction of being shy).<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, for the word “Prime”, is that a brand name of a particular product? Or is it a top grade thing or the best part? Please specify what “Prime” is, since Kelly and I are not perfect, although I have done the translation slightly better than her.<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope it helps you with the meaning of the meaning. Zaijian! (Goodbye!)

If you're trying to constantly translate your thoughts in and out of the foreign language you're trying to speak, you'll never be fast and fluent. You have to just let go of English after awhile, and remember the foreign language in the same way you do English.<br>  <br>  I studied abroad in Ferrara, Italy for a semester, and lived with an Italian family.

While my native language is English, I grew up speaking Chinese in my home with my mother and younger sisters. I remember it was 50/50 as to thinking in either language - some days it was English, usually when I was with my English-speaking friends and other days I would think in Chinese because it was just the dominant language at the moment, or whenever I was abroad in Hong Kong visiting relatives. I remember I wouldn't think in English while abroad, especially as I was practically surrounded by Chinese and almost no English most of the time.

SeTu5q7iaa	You are referring to the dialect of Beijing, the standard dialect of Chinese language, also called standard Mandarin. The change of particular properties of a language when at least two syllables are spoken together is called sandhi. In this case, this dialect has tone sandhi. There are many dialects of Chinese language that exhibit changes in tone when a person say more than one Chinese character, while others have tones remain mostly unchanged, with the exception of few circumstances.<br>  <br>  Yes, in Beijing dialect, if two Chinese characters both have third tone (low falling then low rising, also 214), second character will remain unchanged, but first character will changed its tone to second tone (high rising, also 35). If three or more characters all have third tone, the general rule is all but the last character will changed their tone to second tone.<br>  <br>  I hope you understand the concept of tone sandhi.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Well, we started off as Old Germanic, and then we combined I think with some Celtic languages and Viking/Norse languages. Then Latin came along because of all the religious converting going on during the Middle Ages, and we got a bit of Greek too when we rediscovered the Ancient Texts. Then the French conquered us, mingling Old English with Old French, and I believe that's where English basically remained, evolving sort of on its own until it got to where we are today. <br>  <br>  There's also all the influence of immigrants in America, which encompasses some twenty or so main languages or dialects.

Bx4cFG4maa	The past participle of bestellen is bestellt (used with haben)<br>  It is a regular/weak verb so a -t is at the end instead of -en for a strong/irregular verb. <br>  When a verb begins with be- or ver- , ge- is not usually added to the start for perfect tense because gebestellt or gevergessen(forgot) would be too hard to say, instead bestellt and vergessen are used.<br>  Haben is used because to order is not a verb of motion, nor does it indicate a change of state(eg.freeze). Sein would be used in these cases but for most verbs, haben a used. <br>  <br>  The full conjugation would be<br>  <br>  Ich habe ... bestellt<br>  Du hast ...bestellt<br>  Er/sie/es/man hat ... bestellt<br>  Wir haben ... bestellt<br>  Ihr habt ... bestellt<br>  sie/Sie haben ... bestellt<br>  <br>  Eg.

In the word 福 (fuku) the "f" is more like an "h" than anything, so that's definitely /?/. As for /?/ that happens with all "hi" sounds in any language anyway (as far as I can tell), so I'm not surprised. And /h/ is obviously used as well, like in 花 (hana, "flower").<br>  <br>  It seems like it's /ha/ /?i/ /?u/ /h?/ and /h?/.<br>  <br>  But don't ask me why all those sounds developed as they did. It's like trying to ask why we have the /n/ and /?/ in English.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Yep, that's French, though interestingly, "pleurerà" doesn't exist as a French verb. The verb "pleurer" exists, but the ending "-erà" is only in Italian, not French. I'm sure the writer meant to write "pleurera" instead. Also, "souviens" is the "you" form of "know," yet the person is using "vous," which is "you all," so that doesn't match up.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it basically means "And it will be mourned for all these days, you will not remember me," or something like that. My French is a little rusty, and the wording is a little strange, so that's an approximation.<br>  <br>  et (ay) = and<br>  pleurera (plur-eh-rah) = s/he/it will cry, s/he/it will mourn<br>  faire (fair) = to do, to make<br>  tous (too) = all<br>  les (lay) = the<br>  jours (joor) = days<br>  maintenant (mah-teh-non) = now<br>  vous (voo) = you all<br>  ne ... pas (nuh ... pah) = not<br>  me (muh) = me<br>  souviens (soo-vee-en) = remember<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|KmCWB9fTaa	Yes, each word is French, but combined to one another they don't make a meaningful sentence|`|iSA5dGwKaa	i am sure it is french it is something talking about today !<br>  but i donnow the rest<br>  sory

Zxwa5M7Qaa	The problems concerning literal translation depend on what you're translating. A great example is poetry: a literal translation will almost never preserve original rhymes, rhythms, etc. Also, cultural notes are VERY key, and often don't translate; for example when I lived in East Africa we had a speaker come from the States. During his talk, he gave an illustration using a dog; what he didn't realize is that culturally, the entire illustration fell flat on its face, because dogs are very dirty animals in the place I was at and therefore people were shocked to even hear him talking about them. Puns obviously don't translate either, and finally you often end up in a situation of just not having a word for what you're translating (again, where I lived in East Africa, there was no word for snow because, well, duh, it didn't snow, and therefore snow translated as hail, which is NOT the same thing). Hope that helps!|`|lLPIs7WFaa	The most hazardous part of literal translations is regional variations of definition. The same word can mean a dozen different things in any given language.  Or one thing can have a dozen different words for it.  We call a pack of cigarettes a pack of cigarettes.  Western canadians call it a deck of smokes.    Try this sometime, if you can get three or four people of different generations its even better, lay a dollar bill on the table and have everyone think of all the different names theyve ever heard for it.  You'll be surprised. Buck, single, one, greenback, frogskin,etc etc etc.  Now, think of someone new to english hearing "I don't give a rats - - -"  They might ask why anyone would give that part of a rat.  And what is the value, symbolic or monetary of a single rats patoot?    The main problem is that even two people who speak the same language may not be saying the same thing.  What if your translator learned his English in hong kong or calcutta or dublin?  A simple sentence would have three different meanings at the minimum.  This is why language is so much fun and diplomacy is so damned hard.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Classic example - English to English:<br>  <br>  "Hie thee to a Nunnery".  It's English, but you have to understand 17th century British slang to understand it - it had nothing to do with religious Catholic women, but a "cat house" has nothing to do with felines, and that's the kind of place Shakespeare was referring to.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Well, take this Italian saying for example: "Fra il dire e il fare c'è di mezzo il mare." <br>  <br>  Literally, it's translated as "Between the saying and the doing there is of middle the sea," but it actually translates more like "Easier said than done."<br>  <br>  See?

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	All languages have naturally-occurring regional accents and dialects, and none of them are "better" than the other, much as British people try to convince everyone that Americans are supposedly butchering "the Queen's English." |`|Tdwj9pXzaa	No possible thing. An accent is merely opinionated. If you put a Chinese American next to a French American that both spoke perfect English, they would still sound different, but they speak and understand English perfectly. Accents are merely opinions and there is no possible "proper accent" for ANY language.
10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Japanese names get their meaning from the way they're written, not the way they're pronounced. This is because there are so many homonyms in Japanese that it's impossible to pinpoint one exact meaning just by the way something is pronounced. For example, the word "ta" can be written as 他 ("other"), 多 ("many"), or 田 ("rice field").<br>  <br>  A quick search on Google reveals a certain Kanako Sakai, a Japanese voice actor. Her name is spelled like this: 香奈子<br>  <br>  香 = incense<br>  奈 = (means nothing on its own)<br>  子 = child<br>  <br>  Then there's a Kanako Enomoto, an actress and model.

10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	You mean the noun? That's "amore" (ah-MOH-reh). The verb "to love" is "amare" (ah-MAH-reh) and is conjugated like this:<br>  <br>  Io amo (EE-oh AH-moh) = I love<br>  Tu ami (too AH-mee) = You love<br>  Lei / Lui ama (lay / LOO-ee AH-mah) = She / He loves<br>  Noi amiamo (noy ah-MYAH-moh) = We love<br>  Voi amate (voy ah-MAH-teh) = Y'all love<br>  Loro amono (LOH-roh AH-moh-noh) = They love|`|4NIxXoRIaa	Kelly is right: the noun for "love" is "Amore" (masculine substantive: L'amore = the love), and the verb becomes, in the infinitive form, "amare" (= to love) [first conjugation, regular, transitive verb].<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the conjugation chart Kelly provided has a typo, since the third plural form is "AMANO" instead of "*amono". For the whole conjugation look at the address I quote below.<br>  <br>  !!! A subtle remark, however, is in order. There is a slight misalignment between the meaning of the english "love" and the Italian "amore", it being that the Italian "amare/amore" is a bit stronger.<br>  If you tell your husband/wife that you love him/her, for example, you correctly use "amare", but to express a weaker feeling, such as when talking of your kitten, or a friend (unless it's a best best best friend or similar), sometimes "amare" is a bit goofy and you prefer the expression "volere bene (a qualcuno)" (*) [which often translates as well to "to love (someone)" in English]. Typically, if you say to a friend "ti amo" (I love you) she/he will feel something disturbing in this expression, since it is somehow reserved for the kind of exclusive love pertaining to a couple.<br>  (*) "Volere bene (a...)" literally means "to wish good things (to...)", but has gained its own meaning as a weaker form of "amare".<br>  <br>  Curiously, for ever weaker meanings (like "I love pizza") you have again to use "Amare", the reason probably being that no misunderstanding is possible (i.e. you don't date pizzas for marriage!).<br>  <br>  Note added: the expression "to make love" translates exactly as expected to "fare l'amore" (note the appearance of the article before the noun), or "fare all'amore" (which however is an obsolete form, mostly found in literature and, nowadays, often used in an ironic fashion).<br>  <br>  Hope this can help, bye bye.<br>

But other countries use it too.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	That's Italian. It means either "hi" or "bye" (much like "aloha" in Hawaiian). The way you really spell it is "ciao," but it is pronounced "chao" (or "chow").<br>  <br>  @ Joseph: Just thought I'd give you something to chew on, since it seems you're interested in this kind of stuff. Ironically, replacing "adiós" ("to God") with "ciao" doesn't help a whole lot. The word "ciao" comes from "schiavo" ("skyah-voh") which means "slave." It was a way of saying "I am your servant" as you leave someone's presence.|`|hIWx7l9Yaa	Ciao is in fact Italian.<br>  <br>  Many other cultures use it, but most notably latin american cultures (mostly coastal nations). Ciao has become a replacement in these cultures due to the normal custom of saying "Adios" being related to religion. Adios translates to "to God" giving glory to the christian deity.  I′m fairly certain that it was changed in an effort to respect those who did not believe in "God."

iH7ZB5Soaa	if an insignificant ruler of small dignity, small pride, and small majesty is told impudently by some unmannerly person: “You may not punish me and you cannot,” if there is no prison in that place, the ruler will certainly have one built for him and will throw him into it. However, by denying Hell, the unbeliever is giving the lie to One of infinite dignity, pride, and glory, Who is sublimely and infinitely powerful, and is accusing Him of impotence, lying, and powerlessness; he is insulting His dignity and offending His pride terribly. He is rebelliously causing affront to His glory. If, to suppose the impossible, there was no reason for Hell’s existence, it would certainly be created for unbelief, which comprises denial and ascribing impotence to this degree, and such an unbeliever would certainly be cast into it.

There was a point where I went to meeting just because I didn't want to get destroyed not because I loved Jehovah and wanted to go to meetings. It happens we're imperfect.

That takes a lot of courage and Jehovah will bless you if you continue. I promise. Look at all the nice comments from your fellow brothers and sisters. There's a blessing right there. <br>  <br>  I don't know what else to do to help you except to tackle the Noah's Flood issue you mentioned. Noah built the ark and preached for I think it was like 50-60 years or something. Anyway it was a long time. The children grew up and married and had their own children etc. They all knew what Noah was up to and had a chance to join him yet only Noah's family survived. One can reason that after so many generations of that; the children were going to grow up and do the same thing as their parents did. Look at today. For decades now people are having families but look at the response. Things have gotten worse not better and fewer and fewer are listening to the good news. In MOST cases children follow (or are close to) the path of their parents. In Armageddon children will die too. But their parents and grandparents etc had a chance to change that for them.

Satan wants you to feel unworthy and that you can't approach Jehovah, that he how he draws so many people away. Jehovah has given us the priviledge of prayer because without it how can we believe in anything??? Pour your heart out to him, the good and the bad. He will help you! Speak with other witnesses and study the Bible earnestly. If you are sincere in doing this then you will have peace, Jehovah promises that!

AA10883660	The word “hell” is found in many Bible translations. In the same verses other translations read “the grave,” “the world of the dead,” and so forth. Other Bibles simply transliterate the original-language words that are sometimes rendered “hell”; that is, they express them with the letters of our alphabet but leave the words untranslated. What are those words? The Hebrew she’ohl′ and its Greek equivalent hai′des, which refer, not to an individual burial place, but to the common grave of dead mankind; also the Greek ge′en?na, which is used as a symbol of eternal destruction. However, both in Christendom and in many non-Christian religions it is taught that hell is a place inhabited by demons and where the wicked, after death, are punished (and some believe that this is with torment).<br>  <br>  “Much confusion and misunderstanding has been caused through the early translators of the Bible persistently rendering the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades and Gehenna by the word hell. The simple transliteration of these words by the translators of the revised editions of the Bible has not sufficed to appreciably clear up this confusion and misconception.”—The Encyclopedia Americana (1942), Vol. XIV, p. 81.<br>  <br>  Translators have allowed their personal beliefs to color their work instead of being consistent in their rendering of the original-language words. For example: (1) The King James Version rendered she’ohl′ as “hell,” “the grave,” and “the pit”; hai′des is therein rendered both “hell” and “grave”; ge′en?na is also translated “hell.” (2)?Today’s English Version transliterates hai′des as “Hades” and also renders it as “hell” and “the world of the dead.” But besides rendering “hell” from hai′des it uses that same translation for ge′en?na. (3)?The Jerusalem Bible transliterates hai′des six times, but in other passages it translates it as “hell” and as “the underworld.” It also translates ge′en?na as “hell,” as it does hai′des in two instances. Thus the exact meanings of the original-language words have been obscured.<br>  <br>  Rom. 6:23: “The wages sin pays is death.”<br>  <br>  Eccl. 9:5,?10: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all .?.?. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol,* the place to which you are going.” (If they are conscious of nothing, they obviously feel no pain.) (*“Sheol,” AS, RS, NE, JB; “the grave,” KJ, Kx; “hell,” Dy; “the world of the dead,” TEV.)<br>  <br>  (Genesis 3:19) In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”<br>  <br>  “I have hope toward God .?.?. that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”—ACTS 24:15.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses believe what the bible teaches - when we die we go back to the ground from which we came.We remain in God's memory and await a resurrection.|`|c04c66fe2f7520a305d4676ca06e8647aa	Jehovah's Witnesses believe that all people who die go to the common grave of the humankind (hell, Sheol or Hades). This is not a certain place in the Universe but a state of nonexistence. So, Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in a fiery hell where bad people are tortured forever since the Bible doesn't teach that, but the pagan religions.<br>  <br>  **In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return. -- Genesis 3:19 (Adam was made out of dust; he had no previous existence. So it is logical to conclude that after he died and returned to be dust, he actually ceased to exist.)<br>  <br>  **For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. -- Ecclesiastes 9:5|`|P6atY3xXaa	Hell is the grave, just the ground, and all get out.<br>  <br>  Rev. 20  KJV<br>  5But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. <br>   13And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. <br>  <br>   14And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. <br>  <br>  After the 1,000 years, hell is destroyed symbolicly in gehenna/lake of fire so no one will ever go there again.<br>  <br>  Debbie|`|4hsl2toNaa	Hell is the common grave of mankind.  Hellfire does not exist.  It is symbolic of total destruction.|`|0109ed0c62f90fd240f61d40fe8209acaa	Not the you will burn type of hell.|`|SXB3I6Vraa	The short answer: No, Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe in a burning hell where souls are tortured for all eternity. They believe that death is death and that there is no conscious existence after it.<br>  <br>  In support, they cite the usage of the Hebrew word "Sheol" [Eng. hell, grave, death, ect.] throughout the "Old Testament," which reveals that fire and torture was never associated with it.<br>  <br>  Illustrated here:<br>  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040205173012/hector3000.future.easyspace.com/hell.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/2004020517301...</a><br>  <br>  Witnesses also provide extensive linguistic and contextual evidence showing that the "Old Testament" concept of Hell remained consistent even though the "New Testament."<br>  <br>  Hal Flemings (A brilliant man and one of my favorite authors), writes a very good article on the subject, and incorporates most of the same points and evidence that Witnesses use.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jehovah.to/exe/general/hell.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jehovah.to/exe/general/hell.htm</a><br>  <br>  As as for historical consistency - the Witnesses' view of Hellfire has been the same for 130 years, since the days of C.T. Russell himself.<br>  <br>  “death is death, and that our dear ones, when they pass from us, are really dead, that they are neither alive with the angels nor with demons in a place of despair (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10; Romans 5:12; 6:23; and Genesis 2:17)…The scriptures are in full harmony with what you and I and every other sane, reasonable person in the world shall concede to be the reasonable and proper character of our God. What is declared of our heavenly Father? That he is just, that he is wise, that he is loving, that he is powerful. All Christian people will acknowledge these attributes of the divine character. If this is so, can we find any sense of the word in which we could conceive of God as just and yet punishing a creature of His own hand to all eternity, no matter what the sin was? I am not an apologist for sin; I do not live in sin myself, and I never preach sin. . . . But I tell you that all these people around here that our brother [Dr. Eaton] says are making the air blue with their blasphemies of God and the holy name of Jesus Christ are all people who have been taught this doctrine of eternal torment. And all the murderers, thieves and evil doers in the penitentiaries, were all taught this doctrine. . . . These are bad doctrines; they have been injuring the world this long time; they are not a part of the Lord’s teaching at all, and our dear brother has not gotten the smoke of the dark ages rubbed out of his eyes yet.” (Public debate between C. T. Russell and Dr. E. L. Eaton, 1903)|`|0yTM98Odaa	They believe hell is just the common grave which makes sense since Hades, Sheol and Gehenna all actually translate as grave!  <br>  <br>  And I wouldn't call it the typical Judeo-Christian version of hell since the Jewish idea of the afterlife varies and is completely different to Christian.|`|AA11025703	Hell, according to the Bible, is simply death or "the grave".<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  No we don't believe in/support the concept of Hellfire.
5ofS2qQYaa	you mean killing a suffering animal?    well, I don't think we're allowed to eat the animal if it's already suffering b/c of disease or issues...    she spelled it right people...educate yourselves!  ---  okay, found something...basically it says the same thing  No Human has the right to take innocent life that does not put you to harm:  "  Is it right to put the little thing out of her misery, as it were? That is a serious question, because it involves a decision to end a life, which God has given. I feel that no human being is entitled to do so, whether that is an animal or human life. Had she sought Islamic advice, she would have been told that it is kinder to leave the poor kitten to Gods mercy. It is He who has created it. He is more merciful to His creation than we can ever be. I would never advise her to kill even an injured animal. If she cannot help that animal, she should leave him to the One who can in all situations, i.e. God the Creator of all.

jfOSVSQkaa	You can not be spiritual without believing in God or a higher being.  All people who are spiritual have a religion and believe in God for example when the Chinese mediate, they mediate to Buddha, and when the Hindus mediate, they mediate to OM (Hindu God).  Islam has a whole spiritual system like a government.  The Native Americans who are spiritual also believe in God. <br>  <br>    In conclusion, I firmly believe that to be spiritual one has to belive in a higher being, God.|`|13c36f0b8ad9a3e212bb0604e034744aaa	You do not need to believe in God to be spiritual, and MANY people in churches or mosques are definitely not spiritual.

If he is worried about it going inside his *****, he can wear a condom, and then it's a simple matter of washing himself afterwards.<br>  <br>  There are definite benefits to having sex while on your period, the main one being a relief from menstrual cramps.  The physical action provides serious relief.  <br>  <br>  Also, a woman's sex drive tends to increase during this time due to hormone fluctuations.  This is part of the reason women "go crazy" during their cycle.  Add the other hormone-related symptoms, such as anxiety, grouchiness, etc, and sex is a perfect tool for relief.  If you've experienced an orgasm, you know what I'm talking about.  Moreover, sex releases endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I know Muslims and Christians too have some rule about no sex with the unclean blah blah blah, but it's very healthy for the woman's body and a great relief during that time.<br>  <br>  I would be pretty offended if I had a sexual partner who refused to have sex with me during my period.

But that's not cultural so much as just nice.  His father (and mine) are no longer among the living, so it would be nice to hold onto his memory in that way.

But there is a common perception that people on the streets are there because they abuse drugs & alcohol & they've been evicted from wherever they were living before.  Of course that's not always the case.  It's difficult to get a job when you're homeless as it's hard to maintain a good appearance when living on the street in terms of hygiene, clothes & having a healthy complexion & really you need an address in order to get a job as they ask for one on your CV for a start.  I think the comments here are very mean & naive re people thinking it's that easy a situation to get out of.  <br>  <br>  Have you gotten in touch with the Salvation Army to see if they can help you find accomodation, clothes for job interviews & help in finding work so you can stay off the street?<br>  <br>  If you are saying you don't want a job & want to stay on the street then unfortunately you are always going to have this problem of people being abusive & thinking you have drug or alcohol problems as people don't understand why someone would willingly live on the street.|`|uC2Whritaa	Sorry but a job has everything to do with it, then you wouldn't be homeless!

Personally, I'd say that if you're a Christian, this is part of growing up. Within your home / family church, your youth group, among your Christian peers, it's very easy to have certainties and clarities that come more from a social dynamic than anything else. When hard questions hit you for real, which they do as you get older or as hard experiences come your way, often that 'fellowship' dwindles away, Christian friends disappear into the woodwork, and there's just you and a hard time. Doubts can hit for all sorts of reasons; circumstances, a new person who makes an impact, a book, or a thing I've seen too many times by far, a young Christian is badly let down when a trusted Christian leader falls badly into sin or hypocrisy.    Major prophetic figures in the Old Testament either prayed to die, or wished they'd never been born ... check out Job, Elijah, Jeremiah ... and Jesus himself wished he could not go through with God's will when he was in the garden, and felt abandoned and lost at the moment of his most total obedience. Spirituality in the real world is like this, not glib certainties and one-line answers and quoting 'a verse' in a trite way.    The more you understand of anything, the more you realise you don't understand. What we do is we grow our sense of how small a distance our understanding reaches. All sorts of things can suddenly open that up. And if you work hard at the new questions, and find answers to them, you'll come to value the times of doubt and uncertainty. But that doesn't happen for everyone, and for many it takes years, decades even.    Welcome to real faith. And I don't mean that in the slightest flippantly.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Absolutely..happened to me just last night, as a matter of fact.|`|gUFgGBwraa	You will never know God fully.

9MhdJ1YDaa	It does not say anything about Moses and Elijah in Revelation 11 (or anywhere else in Revelation).    The two witnesses are un-named, but likely meant for us to look back to the prophecy of Zechariah 4:11-14:     11 Then I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees-at the right of the lampstand and at its left?"   12 And I further answered and said to him, "What are these two olive branches that drip into the receptacles of the two gold pipes from which the golden oil drains?"   13 Then he answered me and said, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."   14 So he said, "These are the two anointed ones, who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth."    The two annointed ones there are the king and the priest, Joshua and Zerubbabel (Zech.3). Both are images of Christ, who is both High Priest and King. These witnesses are likely then more imagery of the power of Christ, as a King (law) and as a High Priest (intercession)|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	More morally ambiguous characters, that apparently get killed by the beast/angel of the abyss Abaddon.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	They are not Moses and Elijah.

wlGVy803aa	You are refering to II Thess 2:1 - 4.  (Rapture of the church).    The people who are left will go thru the 7 yr tribulation.  Yes, it is possible to be saved because Revelation speaks of those who died during that time and are clothed in white robes awaiting the second coming.  Rev. 7: 14    Being saved during that awful time will be most difficult and those who take the mark of the beast will not go to heaven.    Ezekial 40 speaks of the spiritual rebirth of Israel after God destroys those who participated in the Gog and Magog battle (primarly Russia and Iran.  Ez. 38&39).|`|XnH2FvJ9aa	CJ is a retard.|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	Before the Antichrist is to be revealed , the rapture will occur.  I don't believe there is specification if this weeks, days, minutes or such in the Bible.   We will not be here to see who the antichrist even is.  When the church is raptured and the christians are removed the holy spirit is then removed from earth.  God's holy spirit is here to protect his people and when his people are gone from the earth he has no need to keep his spirit here.     Once the antichrist is revealed, the 7 yr treaty with Israel will be signed and the first seal will be broken and when the treaty is signed is when the tribulation period clock officially starts.   There will be people that will be saved after the rapture and during the tribulation period. They will end up martyrs for their beliefs during the tribulation period, for the antichrist will have a global religion that will not have any association with God at all.   Israel will not take over again. Israel will believe that by signing the covenant that they are safe and protected and they are under a false peace of security and protection.    There will be deception in extreme measure.  Most will think that the antichrist is the messiah and that he is the one they have waited for.   Most will not be aware of the rapture because the holy spirit is gone and the devil has full reign to deceive many.  God will let this happen,for I think that God will let man have what he wants.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Those who have read the scriptures and believe in Jesus Christ will know by discernment of the Holy Spirit (which lives inside the saved person) that he (the AntiChrist)  is in fact here.

When Jesus comes back to take those who believe in Him up to heaven, honey the ones left on earth will go to hell. These are the ones who do not believe in Jesus Christ. There will be a new heaven and earth and Jesus will reigned forever over both.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	How can any evil or sin exist in the earth, and the Holy Spirit still be  here, even before antichrist is revealed?

The danger of the rapture doctrine is that some people might think they can fool around until the good people suddenly disappear. Unfortunately, we only get one chance. The Bible makes it clear when Jesus comes back to get the righteous and raise the dead, the wicked can't stand to see the glory of His face. The second coming involves both the wicked and the saved. The rapture will not be a secret.     1 Thess. 4:16

YupMCYHlaa	The rate of abortion went way down during Clinton's two terms, and back up again when Bush got into the White House.    This proves what I've always said, that the Republican battle against abortion is all words, it's all about politics.  The abortion issue was custom designed for the 1980 election to get Christians to vote Republican.  But the Republicans (and corrupt Christian leaders who support them) would rather have -more- abortions because it strengthens their grip on the Christian Right.  They have resisted any actual attempts to ban abortion because they've been trying to milk maximum political mileage out of the issue. Which by now they just about have.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Because they did not pay attention. That's why. Or maybe they lived by the "it will not happen to me" excuse.

[1] A Sure which We have sent down and which We have   ordained: in it have We sent down Clear Signs, in order   that ye may receive admonition.     [2] The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication   flog each of them with a hundred stripes: let not compassion   move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah,   if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of   the Believers witness their punishment.     [3] Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any   but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever: nor let any   but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman: to the   Believers such a thing is forbidden.    [4] And those who launch a charge against chaste women,   and produce not four witnesses, (to support their allegations),   flog them with eighty stripes; and reject their evidence ever after:   for such men are wicked transgressors;     [5] Unless they repent thereafter and mend (their conduct):   for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.      (Al'Quran)  Surah :4 An-Nissa     [14] But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress   His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: and they   shall have a humiliating punishment.     [15] If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, take the evidence   of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if   they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or   Allah ordain for them some (other) way.

JESUS on adultery....  "3The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court, 4they said to Him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act. 5"Now in the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women; what then do You say?" 6They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground. 7But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her. 8Again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. 9When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court. 10Straightening up, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?" 11She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more." 12Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life."|`|sjMIFH9Faa	Although I will say that such inequality is sad in out day of age, but the issue isn't religious, its cultural.     The ancient Greeks for example, the ones we all idolize, had a very sexist culture. In Greek myth, woman (Pandora) was a punishment upon mankind for upsetting Zeus. Thucydides wrote that the best reputation a woman could have was none at all. Ironically, for issues like adultery, the woman wasn't punishable by law, the Greeks though that a woman didn't hold enough self control to reject the seduction of a man. So in adultery, the man who had relations with the married woman was punished. I could go on about how unfair the Greeks were to women.     Neither Judaism, Christianity, nor Islam started sexism in western or Near Eastern cultures. It existed long before any of these religions. I will admit, its sad that Islam still holds to these traditions, but dont think Islam began it.

zdu3gh8jaa	I think it's a great idea, we used to do this loads when ours were small and the loved it. It was like a real adventure to them and has given them some great memories. Also don't write off actually going camping with your little ones. We took ours when they were 3,5 and 7 and although it was hard work, they really enjoyed it and it was great to be out in the open. If you do decide to go to a campsite with them I suggest that you only book for one or two nights for the first time to see how they get on with it. Definately give it a go in the garden though, I remember spending one summer sleeping on our lawn more than I slept in bed.

f8mLpPXlaa	If there was no war, no hunger, no cruelty, no greed wouldn't this be Heaven? Granted, if there is a Hell than it's full of evil and torture and things we can't imagine.<br>  You speak of judging God for the famines and the crimes. Look to yourself for the source of these things. Not you in particular but people who have free choice and choose to do evil. <br>  The world is exactly the way it should be. Instead of judging, get down on your knees and thank God you are who you are.<br>  Judge not and ye shall not be judged. In other words if you go around with bias and aforethought making snap decisions about people based on skin color, what they wear or their body type , without looking for the good in everyone than God will judge you the same way. <br>  God bless.|`|QtCQtXDVaa	You say you believe in god, but I think you believe in the concept of god as passed down by others. If you truly believed in God, you wouldn’t think that “he” “does” “things” you don’t like. If you truly believed in God you would know God. And by knowing God, you would act loving. Do you? Are all of your actions filled with love? And only love? Because that’s what it means, don’t judge God.

Pus0yLkeaa	Yes, on the surface it would appear that agnostics are about the same as atheists.  But that's just how it looks.  I count myself as an agnostic because (1) I don't believe in any of the earthly "gods" (2) but I prefer to believe in a supreme creator instead.  The SC is all powerful, but also totally mysterious in that no one on earth knows anything about him.    The earthly religions are long on fantasy, but short on reality.  The Christian religions (I was once one) believe in a very old book, the origin of which is doubtful and the very nature of this book (obsolescence) make it virtually unbelievable.  It is full of fairy tales and rife with contradictions.  I don't believe in the concept of an afterlife nor those of heaven or hell.    You call us cowards for following a concept of belief that we find plausible and realistic.  But it is what we choose and your use of that term to describe us marks you as a very immature individual.|`|AA10873763	Please know the definition of a word before you use it, lest you appear ignorant.  An agnostic isn't "50/50".  An agnostic acknowledges that the existence of gods is unknowable.  Anyone who claims not to be agnostic, then, is the ignorant one.  Belief or disbelief is another matter entirely.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Oh, quit quoting Dawkins as though you know what you're talking about.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Unlike atheists, agnostics are searching for an answer. Atheists have no interest in magical fairies or the possibility than any given one might exist. Agnostics do not know, and care. Atheists do not know, and do not care.|`|WalnRzfGaa	you don't even know what and atheist or agnostic is. hmm who is really ignorant here...    Atheist by definition is someone that does NOT believe in the existence of a God/Gods.    Agnostic by definition is someone that knows you can not prove or disprove the existence of God there for KNOWS you can not know the truth about it.      now there are agnostics like myself that lean more towards atheist's view rather then a theist view, and there are some that lean more towards the theist view.    what was that about ignorance again?    Dawkins has a scale for which he rates theist to atheist. its 1 to 7. 7 being 100% sure there is not go and 1 being 100% sure there is a God.  Dawkins even admits that he is a 6 since as a scientist he cant leave out the possibility that he is wrong.    you think your so smart but to be atheist is to believe with 100% cccertainty there is no God or Gods. to be a theist means you believe with 100% certainty there is a God. anything in between is an agnostic.  you are not helping your point by calling people names it in fact only damages what you are trying to say.|`|wwdllMzYaa	no, not because they are agnostics no    im not surprised by the content of your "question" as your first words kind of suggest the rest    but in short, labels are labels, no one likes them and they are rarely descriptive  and if soemone wants to call themselvs one label when you think they are another, whos choice is it?  theirs?  or  yours?    is theirs of course    so regardless of what you think about the labels atheists and agnostic, if soemon says im an atheist, or im an agnostic, then thats whty they are till they know or say different|`|UWKF7x4faa	You're a semantic genius.

If I tell people I'm an atheist, they say if I am even willing to consider the possibility of a God, then I'm an agnostic.  If I say I'm an agnostic, you say I have to be 50/50.    Your argument makes no sense.  Certainly there are going to be people who are 30/70 or 80/20.  These people should be considered agnostics.|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	its better to be on the safe side and believe in god :) afterall you are risking your afterlife. non-believers will not enter paradise. how can you go against the one who created you? you think you just popped out the ground with no reason of being or living? what kind of proof do you need? you want god to take his morning strolls around the neighborhood knocking on everyones door saying "good morning im god how are you?" ummm no. visual proof is not always the way to go. if you do not believe you will not achieve.|`|AA11264399	To be agnostic just means that you think it's wrong to assert the truth of a proposition without logically satisfactory argument and/or objective evidence, and no-one in their right mind would argue with that principle.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	There are ignorant people with all sorts of philosophies I find the most ignorant to be evangelical fundamentalists.

If it's not refrigerated, it goes off after a few hours.  You can convert it to something vaguely resembling bacon by wrapping it in kitchen paper and microwaving it for half a minute.  All the water and goo comes out and you can fry the tiny rasher of pig meat that's left over.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I don't remember it ever coming in any way except from the package.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah.

He is exempt from having any partners, helpers, or fellows. His relations with all beings are those of Creator. He creates through His pre-eternal will with the command of “Be!,” and it is. He is far beyond having any relation which is contrary to perfection, or is compelling, necessitating, or involuntary.Almighty God is pre-eternal and post-eternal, He is the First and the Last.

While some of the scholars whose belief was weak but whose egotism was strong have gone as far as denying them.It's explained in 12 principles at:<br>  www.lightofquran.info/24word.htm<br>  2.Relation of Quran and Hadith:<br>  God’s Most Noble Messenger (Upon whom be blessings and peace) was a human being; hence he acted like a human being. He was also a messenger and prophet, and with regard to his messengership, he was an interpreter and an envoy of Almighty God. His messengership was based upon Revelation, which is of two kinds:<br>  The First is explicit Revelation. In this case, the Noble Messenger is merely an interpreter and announcer, with no share in the content. The Qur’an and some Sacred Hadith are included in this kind of Revelation.<br>  The Second is implicit Revelation. The essence and summary of this is also based on Revelation or inspiration, but its explanation and description were left to the Messenger. When he explained and described such Revelation, sometimes he again relied on Revelation, or on inspiration, or sometimes he spoke in terms of his own insight. And, when he resorted to his own interpretation, he either relied on the perceptive power given him on account of his prophetic mission, or he spoke as a human being and conformably to usage, custom and the level of common comprehension.<br>  Thus, all the details of every Hadith are not necessarily derived from pure revelation, nor should the lofty marks of messengership be sought in such thoughts and transactions of his as are required by his participation in the human state. Since some truths were revealed to him in a brief and abstract form, and he himself described them in the light of his insight and according to common comprehension, the metaphors and allusions in his descriptions sometimes may need explanation, or even interpretation. There are, indeed, some truths that the human mind can grasp only by way of comparison. <br>  3.ALIF. LAM. MIN and others (Huruf-u Mukattaa) are divine code words.Muhammad(PBUH) has the keys for those codes.Scholars of Islam has explained many facts by those codes.It's explained in detail:<br>  www.lightofquran.info/25word.htm<br>  4.'Sahabahs doubt about some suras belonging to the Qur’an….was because each of the suras was only reported by one person.' This is wrong and lie.There wasn't even one sahabah doubtfull about Quran mentioned in the history.Each of the suras had been kept and memorized and later written by many sahabas.<br>  Look at what Allah says:<br>  'We have, without doubt, sent down the Message; and We will assuredly guard it (from corruption). ' (Quran 15/9)|`|stD14wWaaa	I believe in Jesus Alayhi Salam, the prophet sent by Allah to teach the truth of Islam. He is clean from what the people accuse him, and he will tell you that on the day of judgment.<br>  It was never the teaching of Islam to publicly criticize others religion. We should live in respect though we know what we believe.<br>  I will be one in prayer with my brothers and sisters in Islam<br>  May Allah open your heart and mind to see the truth that is in front of you Ameen.<br>  Verily, He is All-Wise, the Most forgiving and Most generous.

AA10192697	My footnotes say "This is apparently a fragment of an old legend that had borrowed much from ancient mythology. The sacred author incorporates it here, not only in order to account for the prehistoric giants of Palestine (where Goliath was from), whom the Israelies called the Nephilim. But also to introduce the story of the flood with a moral orientation, the contantly increasing wickedness of mankind.|`|vUiUoamVaa	You really have to read this more literally than it is written...<br>  <br>  "sons of God" = equal those who tried to follow what God had taught was right and wrong<br>  <br>  "and daughters were born unto them" = we know that Adam and Eve had more than four kids.  Obviously at least a few also decided to try to modify/change/ignore some of God's directives concerning their existence on Earth.  These are the "daughters of men" because their parents had sinned so much that God would have nothing to do with them.  Amazing how little time it took!<br>  <br>  Perhaps Seth was a son of God - who remained close to what God had tried to teach Adam and Eve - saw a woman who was born from Cain or one of his brothers or whomever...it does not matter....a man who was trying to keep God's will saw a woman which was very lovely and he did not care about her beliefs.  They joined and had babies and it just went downhill from there.  <br>  <br>  "Giants" seems to refer to genetic abnormalities, that is, deformed babies.  Yes, some well could have become huge in size.  It does not refer to men or women spefically...their off-spring...they in-bred way too closely, like cousin to cousin to cousin to grandparent?  There is no way to tell, but that is sort of a guess.  <br>  <br>  Mighty men, men of renown.  They were tribal leaders?  I am guessing, but yes, surely one group would become more adapt or feared than another one.<br>  <br>  As I said, you have to consider how it was written and try to apply what what we know now to all of that...it makes sense to me.<br>  <br>  It is said that Adam and Eve had something like 46 or more kids...so if that were the case, it is easy to believe.<br>  <br>  Jesus had other brothers and sisters.  We are not sure how many.  Four brothers but not sure on the sisters -- hey, they have to trace their line from the father (sounds sort of unfair to me) and since they seemed to have no big influence later on, they were ignored.|`|Shi5z6iJaa	they were Larry, Moe and Curly and they are talked about in Stooges 1:1-5 And lo the sons of god shall appear as caterers unto a great feast.

0AxXQ1Jeaa	Yes they should. Not just for that reason, if you ask me. They should be allowed to get married, because any two people who want to make their relationship official should be allowed to do so.|`|qrF5zTqMaa	i don't see why not? i think hetrosexual and homosexual couples are equal because everyone is equal... i don't really get the issue, whats peoples problem?|`|AA10192697	no. Allowing gays (a sinful act) to take care of the product of babies born out of wedlock (a sinful act) doesn't justify the means.<br>  <br>  Christians do preach morals in the home. Some kids don't listen to us. Children naturalls rebel. Instead of ranting about premarital sex by teens, rant about the media, music, movies, books, magazines that glamourize sex. We all live here together and should work together. We live in the land of the free but we have been abusing those freedoms for far too long.<br>  <br>  Just because I believe in God and the the Bible is His Word and think gays are living a sinful sexual lifestyle doesn't mean I am a gay basher, or homophobic. I am learning God's rules and gays are disobeying their Creator. Simple. Just like when I use to drink to get drunk. I no longer drink, I avoid my addiction. Gays can avoid their urges by turning their lives to God, their Creator.<br>  <br>  No one is better than another person. But it is God that laid down the laws and we have the choose to obey or not.<br>  <br>  The definition of marriage has never changed in thousands of years. Just because gays want to marry for tax benefits, being able to visit their lover in the hospital, to put each other in each other's wills, etc, doesn't mean the definition and sanctity of marriage should be changed.  Adultery is wrong yet millions of people do it. Should it not be okay?<br>  <br>  You can fight people and government and even God, but righteousness always wins and that's God.|`|AA10351261	Gay marriage is sort of a newer concept and hasn't been going on for a very long time. What would happen when the gays start getting divorced too?<br>  Plus, what would be right and wrong in the child's mind?  Who's mom & who's dad? What would the other kids think & say when they found out that little Johnny has two men as his parents? Mom and dad are both men---wow. <br>  Plus, in adoption the person doesn't always get to make all the choices. What if the child is of the opposite sex as the adopting parents?  Again---wow.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Yes.  The "sanctity" of marriage is long gone when we have Britney Spears, drunk, marrying for one weekend and shows like the "Bachelor."<br>  <br>  I believe that is why God created us gay people.  To provide loving homes to the thousands of children those choosing the heterosexual lifestyle pop out and discard like old dish rags.|`|283tO9j9aa	I was totally going to agree with you until I saw the additional details about single parents. I was brought up in a one parent home and I've done okay, just like most of the other kids I know that were brought up by one parent. I don't know if I can agree with saying a gay couple would always do better than a single parent. Surely they're all as good as each other?<br>  <br>  I think gay/lesbian couples, single parents and all kinds of families should be treated in the same way. If you love your kids and do your best to bring them up to be decent people, that's what matters, not how many parents there are and their genders.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	I completely agree with you. My best friend growing up is a lesbian and she went into the military and to "prove" she wasn't gay she had sex with a man. This so called man, refused to believe that the child was his and has never paid a dime of child support. He has never seen his precious son. She raised him mostly by herself and recently with a partner. He is 18 years old now and going to college and is a very well adjusted young man. He has a long term girlfriend who he intends to marry after they are finished with college.<br>  <br>   Imagine that! Being gay isn't contagious! Her son didn't turn out gay. So much for exposure to that type of life causing a person to TURN gay.|`|zLeeLVaEaa	I believe in equal rights!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone has a right to get married and have exactly the same rights.<br>  It makes me sick to hear that some people are against gay marriages because it is "morally wrong". It is NOT morally wrong and everyone deserve the same rights. Why is it wrong...because it says in the Bible...the Bible is 2000 years old!!!!!!! Have we not grown as a society at all??????? It makes me sick to think people still discriminate because of something said 2000 years ago!!!!!!!!! <br>  Everyone is equal and until people realise this we will never grow.|`|Gl7tkWV7aa	No. They should be allowed to marry because they should be allowed all the same rights as anyone else.|`|senICpbVaa	I am in complete support of gay marriage. <br>  <br>  Equal rights for everyone.|`|evStsOQiaa	Why doesn't the whole world become divorced and gay and let God wipe out the human race that much sooner.|`|AA11723247	And this type of convoluted thinking is why were in this mess in the first place.|`|Dn251zLyaa	No, they shouldn't.

I can only see good coming from that.|`|0109ed0c62f90fd240f61d40fe8209acaa	I  believe that they should be able to get married and start a family like anyone else. They are Americans just like straight people. All of us should be equal, no matter the sexual preference. I believe that they should be able to do what they want. If a gay child results from straight parents, I don't see two mommies or two daddies messing up any child at all. The thought of gay parents messing up some kids childhood is ridicules. Whats so wrong with having two people who will love you and take care of you. And if people think that going from foster home to foster home is easy, then they have never been through that situation. Kids need someone who care about them, and understand enough to be patient, And rusty, what about those straight couples who cant have kids? I am straight and married and I don't think I can conceive.  Does that mean I shouldn't be able to adopt? Who care who can create children? Some straight couples cant and people think that's ok cause its a man and a woman.I think that they have a right to adopt just as much as I would if I couldn't do it the old fashion way.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	To all those who state that children should have a mother and a father my reply is this...<br>  <br>  Surely two gay men or two gay women who are in a stable relationship, have a good home and are financially and mentally secure can offer a child in need of love and security just as much as a mixed sex couple.<br>  <br>  I would rather see children out of care and living with 2 dads or 2 mums as opposed to them staying in care or getting passed around from foster family to foster family.<br>  <br>  Live and let live if you ask me.<br>  <br>  EDIT - now that I have read some of the answers on here I am bemused... So, for those saying that gay marriage is bad because the couple are unable to have children naturally means that they should not be able to adopt. DOes this then mean that a traditional mixed sex couple who due to medical reasons are unable to have children should also not be able to adopt?<br>  <br>  Ignorance is bliss. There are many blissful people on Yahoo! Answers...

Clearly those women are not following God's word if they're allowing jealousy to be a factor in their lives.|`|4DEVVRlIaa	Well there are several options to look at here:    (1) You can politely go up to them and have a polite conversation but at some point slowly bring up why they don't like you.    (2) You could ignore them because you are there to worship and not be harassed by the text book definition of hypocrites.    (3) Maybe trying wearing more appropriate clothing. Just to see if the guys still notice you and if that makes the women upset. Personally the guys should be there to worship, not get laid.    (4) Maybe look into churches where people aren't being jerks. I know I shopped around til I found a pretty cool church that accepted me and they are very nice.    (5) Not go at all to church. I wouldn't recommend it. There is nothing wrong with going to church. You can feel better as a person. It's only an hour long and then you have rest of the day to yourself. You might learn something. God doesn't expect everyone to be perfect.    I hope that things work out. But it never hurts to take the attitude you aren't gonna take grief. You have a right to be there at that church.

She works with you every day and i doubt highly you never talk about your husband. The polite thing to do, once in awhile, is ask about the spouse.

d52bf83507b89849cbeeb5a3afe97afaaa	yes it is true , According to the Gospel of John, the Pharisees, in an attempt to discredit Jesus, brought a woman charged with adultery before him. Then they reminded Jesus that adultery was punishable by stoning under Mosaic law and challenged him to judge the woman so that they might then accuse him of disobeying the law. Jesus thought for a moment and then replied, “He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her.” The people crowded around him were so touched by their own consciences that they departed. When Jesus found himself alone with the woman, he asked her who were her accusers. She replied, “No man, lord.” Jesus then said, “Neither do I condemn thee: go and sin no more.”|`|uy1Nj6uJaa	A priest, Jesus, and an old man tee off.

oTSB5BITaa	Religious prosecution.|`|XoNuUrYoaa	Persecution.    The Amish and other Anabaptists were regarded as dissenters because they believe God only can be the head of the church, not a pope or a King. Anabaptists also consider themselves as members of the Kingdom of God , thus refusing to swear allegiance to their country- in fact the refused to swear an oath at all because the Bible prohibits it.    Today they are viewed as backward and stuck in tradition, but at the time they were very radical because they rejected state religion, infant baptism and believed in a separation of the state and church.    To understand how dangerous this was, we must remember that kings and emperors used the church as a means to control the population.One didn't have a choice in the matter, one was born, baptized into either a Protestant or a Catholic church and an official member from then onwards. So, to reject baptism of newborns on the account of adult baptism being used in the NT, one was also rejecting the state's, the church's and the king's rules.For many the penalty of this was death. Indeed, the term "Ana-baptist" means re-baptizer, because all Anabaptists in this period were baptized twice.     Another radical belief of the Anabaptists was the concept o reading one's Bible.This was the main thin the had in common with the Protestants, but was totally opposed by the Catholic church, which to this very day believes that the Bible is only it for educated priests, not for women nuns or ordinary people.The Anabaptists disagreed, believing the Bible was for all, after all it was written by ordinary people for everyone.    The biggest threat the Anabaptism posed to the Protestants and Catholics, was that it was popular and spreading amongst the ordinary people.Kings, governments, churches and emperors feared an uprising, such as the Munster uprising (15325) and the Peasant's Uprising (1521-1525) .Anabaptism spread because Anabaptists accepted anyone- male, female, young, old,  rich, poor, peasant, lord- and this went against the medieval hierarchy.|`|c4355bd0ba89e8bedb0136a8c6f64cb2aa	Same reason that all discenter churches fled Europe. Civil and religious authorities were threatened by the rapid spread of Anabaptist groups. Over several decades, nearly 2,500 Anabaptists burned at the stake, drowned in rivers, starved in prisons, or lost their heads to the executioners sword. The harsh persecution pushed many Anabaptists underground and into rural hideaways.     The Amish are a Christian church that traces its roots to the Protestant Reformation in sixteenth-century Europe. Amish people accept basic Christian beliefs but also have some special interpretations and emphases that have emerged throughout their history. They migrated from Europe to North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. No Amish remain in Europe. Today they live in nearly 400 different geographical settlements in 27 states and the Canadian province of Ontario. Their population (adults and children) totals approximately 231,000. Their unique practices make them one of Americas most interesting and colourful religious subcultures.     They trace their roots to the Anabaptist movement in Switzerland in 1525 at the time of the Protestant Reformation. The Anabaptists emphasized voluntary adult baptism and a church that was free from state control. Because most had been baptized as infants, they were nicknamed rebaptizers or Anabaptists. The Amish were part of this movement until 1693 when they formed their own group in Switzerland and the Alsatian region of present-day France. Their first leader was Jakob Ammann; hence, they became known as Amish.    In 1693, Ammann sought to revitalize the Anabaptist movement. He proposed holding communion twice a year rather than once, as was the typical Swiss practice. He also suggested that Christians, in obedience to Christ, should wash one anothers feet in the communion service. To promote doctrinal purity and spiritual discipline, Ammann forbade trimming beards and wearing fashionable dress. He administered a strict discipline in his congregations. Appealing to New Testament teaching and the practice of Dutch Anabaptists, Ammann also advocated shunning excommunicated members. This issue drove a divisive wedge between his followers and other Anabaptists living in Switzerland and Alsace.    Regardless of where they live, the Amish speak the Pennsylvania German dialect (popularly known as Pennsylvania Dutch), except in a few communities where they speak a Swiss dialect. English, typically learned in school, is their second language. Most Amish are fluent in both English and the dialect, but very few can speak standard German. Some learn to read old German script so they can read their religious books and publications. Amish people often refer to non-Amish as English, because they speak the English language.     In 1681, William Penn, an English Quaker, received ownership of the land that would eventually become the state of Pennsylvania. He decided to try a "holy experiment:" to establish a colony that would allow religious toleration. This was a relatively novel concept at the time. Amish, Quakers, Mennonites, Moravians, Schwenkfelders and others in Europe responded to the opportunity by moving to the area.     Pennsylvania is the only state with Amish settlements founded during the 18th century, of which it has three--Lancaster, Big Valley, and Meyersdale in Somerset County. Lancaster is the oldest surviving settlement, founded around 1760. High taxes, high rents, inflation, wars and rumors of wars, the military draft, and religious persecution encouraged believers to leave Europe.     Accurate records of the first emigrations to the New World were not kept. The first Amish immigrants for whom records are available -- the Detweiler and Sieber families settled in Berks County, PA in 1736. The bulk of the this first wave of immigration had ceased by 1770. Back in Europe, some Amish families moved to the Hesse region of Germany, Bavaria, Poland and Russia. None of the settlements were ultimately successful, as there is no organized Amish presence in Europe at this time. The last Amish congregation was in Ixheim, Germany. On 1937-JAN-17, it merged with their local Mennonite group.    The War of Independence put a heavy strain on the Amish principle of pacifism and neutrality. The colonies were divided into Patriots and "Tories" -- those loyal to Britain. The Amish attempted to remain non-violent and neutral, but were attacked by both sides. For some of them, their situation was complicated by oaths of loyalty to Britain that they had taken when they were admitted to the colonies.    A second wave of immigration from Europe lasted from 1817 to 1860. About 3,000 Amish relocated to the U.S. They were motivated to leave by religious oppression in Europe, financial problems, crop failures, continuing wars, the military draft, and high taxes. Most settled in  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Ontario in Canada. A few went to Pennsylvania.    Immigrants from
xmnlLubzaa	Well well well...I'm guessing you captured the demon AND HAVE ENSLAVED IT AS YOUR OWN!!!..................................... you remember, I had said that you were screwed if c.w.g.f.s. come after- fear not, as I have come up with a plan          Okay, first you must go into the "Ninth Gate" universe, beat up Johnny Depp, and obtain the Key of Hell.     Next, go to hell (bet you never thought you'd hear that in a good light), and look for a palace- this is the Castle of the Governers of Hell!!!!!    Now, use this map (telepathically sends you map of castle) and go into the library/sitting area. There, you will find a gentleman known as Duke Astaroth. He will be sipping tea and (in an English gentleman's accent) will be saying something like, "hmm, good, very good indeed, mmm, yes delightfully good" (speaking of his crumpet)--    By this time, the c.w.g.f.s. should be down there, will see Astaroth, Astaroth will yell, "Oh whootinanny!" and you should be able to make a run for it. They should be so grateful for being able to severely maim a demon lord that they will let you go!        Congratulations!!!, right?  MWUHAHA, that's too easy, because now you have the entire Government of Hell  (Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Asmodeus, Focalor, Mammon, crippled Astaroth, etc.) after you!!!  Good Luck!|`|AA10032498	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth became illumined by his splendor. He cried out in a mighty voice: "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. She has become a haunt for demons. She is a cage for every unclean spirit, a cage for every unclean bird, (a cage for every unclean) and disgusting (beast). For all the nations have drunk the wine of her licentious passion. The kings of the earth had intercourse with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her drive for luxury."     Then I heard another voice from heaven say: "Depart from her, my people, so as not to take part in her sins and receive a share in her plagues, for her sins are piled up to the sky, and God remembers her crimes. Pay her back as she has paid others. Pay her back double for her deeds. Into her cup pour double what she poured. To the measure of her boasting and wantonness repay her in torment and grief; for she said to herself, 'I sit enthroned as queen; I am no widow, and I will never know grief.' Therefore, her plagues will come in one day, pestilence, grief, and famine; she will be consumed by fire. For mighty is the Lord God who judges her." The kings of the earth who had intercourse with her in their wantonness will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her pyre. They will keep their distance for fear of the torment inflicted on her, and they will say: "Alas, alas, great city, Babylon, mighty city. In one hour your judgment has come."     The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, because there will be no more markets for their cargo: their cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine linen, purple silk, and scarlet cloth; fragrant wood of every kind, all articles of ivory and all articles of the most expensive wood, bronze, iron, and marble; cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; wine, olive oil, fine flour, and wheat; cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human beings. "The fruit you craved has left you. All your luxury and splendor are gone, never again will one find them." The merchants who deal in these goods, who grew rich from her, will keep their distance for fear of the torment inflicted on her. Weeping and mourning, they cry out: "Alas, alas, great city, wearing fine linen, purple and scarlet, adorned (in) gold, precious stones, and pearls.     In one hour this great wealth has been ruined." Every captain of a ship, every traveler at sea, sailors, and seafaring merchants stood at a distance and cried out when they saw the smoke of her pyre, "What city could compare with the great city?" They threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning: "Alas, alas, great city, in which all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth. In one hour she has been ruined. Rejoice over her, heaven, you holy ones, apostles, and prophets. For God has judged your case against her."   A mighty angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea and said: "With such force will Babylon the great city be thrown down, and will never be found again. No melodies of harpists and musicians, flutists and trumpeters, will ever be heard in you again. No craftsmen in any trade will ever be found in you again. No sound of the millstone will ever be heard in you again.  No light from a lamp will ever be seen in you again. No voices of bride and groom will ever be heard in you again.

However, when you become a Christian, your priorities must change.  Granted it will not be easy to wait until marriage.  I think even harder since you have had sex before, but not impossible. If God asks us to not do something or to do something it is not impossible with His strength, or He would ask us to do it or abstain from it. You said something that caught my eye. "What would a relationship be like if you just kiss"-  It will be a relationship based on love, not sex.  It is SO worth waiting- you have had sex before but with the grace of God you can really have a relationship that is meaningful without having sex.

But Thalia is right. It is a problem with the translators, not the original writing.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	The Hebrew word represented in the King James Version by "unicorn" is re'em, which undoubtedly refers to the wild ox (urus or aurochs) ancestral to the domesticated cattle of today. The re'em still flourished in early historical times and a few existed into modern times, although it is now extinct. It was a dangerous creature of great strength and was similar in form and temperament to the Asian buffaloes.    The Revised Standard Version translates re'em as "wild ox." The verse in Numbers is translated as "they have as it were the horns of the wild ox," while the one in Job is translated "Is the wild ox willing to serve you?" The Anchor Bible translates the verse in Job as "Will the buffalo deign to serve you?"    The wild ox was a favorite prey of the hunt-loving Assyrian monarchs (the animal was called rumu in Assyrian, essentially the same word as re'em) and was displayed in their large bas-reliefs. Here the wild ox was invariably shown in profile and only one horn was visible. One can well imagine that the animal represented in this fashion would come to be called "one-horn" as a familiar nickname, much as we might refer to "longhorns" in speaking of a certain breed of cattle.    As the animal itself grew less common under the pressure of increasing human population and the depredations of the hunt, it might come to be forgotten that there was a second horn hidden behind the first in the sculptures and "one-horn" might come to be considered a literal description of the animal.    When the first Greek translation of the Bible was prepared about 250 B.C., the animal was already rare in the long-settled areas of the Near East and the Greeks, who had no direct experience with it, had no word for it. They used a translation of "one-horn" instead and it became monokeros. In Latin and in English it became the Latin word for "one-horn"; that is, "unicorn."    The Biblical writers could scarcely have had the intention of implying that the wild ox literally had one horn. There is one Biblical quotation, in fact, that clearly contradicts that notion. In the Book of Deuteronomy [33:17BT], when Moses is giving his final blessing to each tribe, he speaks of the tribe of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) as follows: "His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns...."    Here the word is placed in the plural since the thought of a "one-horn's" single horn seems to make the phrase "horns of a unicorn" self-contradictory. Still, the original Hebrew has the word in the singular so that we must speak of the "horns of a unicorn," which makes it clear that a unicorn has more than one horn (1968, pp. 186-187).|`|mAE7vbX6aa	I'm not positive about these things, but probably it got changed some time when they were copying the text.  Back then (middle ages) scribes had to transcribe the texts by hand.  Unfortunately, they took it upon themselves to add some stuff and remove other stuff, and they were even known to literally put in stories that weren't even in the original text.  (I refer here to the story about the woman caught in adultery who they wanted to stone where Jesus supposedly said, "he who is without sin, cast the first stone.)  This is not in any of the original texts.  It was added by some scribe who thought it was a good story to tell and it never got removed. )  If you're interested please read anything by Bart D. Ehrman.  He has done much research in this area and it will really open your eyes.

While they might use the word "proof" in science, it is not a scientific idea.  Proving is an exercise in logic.  Proof is arriving at a logical conclusion, based on the available evidence.  Notice that this has absolutely nothing to do with being right or wrong.  It also has nothing to do with science either, since you can have logical conclusions in Social Studies, English, or any other subject.  <br>  <br>  In science you collect empirical evidence through the process of experimentation.  If we collect enough evidence, we will probably notice patterns or regularities in the evidence, and then we will develop generalizations that describe what we have observed.  These generalized descriptions of observed events are called scientific laws.<br>  <br>  Science can't prove mathematics or logic. These are presumptions to the scientific method. Science presumes them to be true and has not proven them to be true.<br>  <br>  Science can't prove the metaphysical. One of the more talked about metaphysical elements is the supernatural. Science deals with nature. The supernatural is outside of nature and therefore outside the abilities of science to take a look at.<br>  <br>  Science can't prove the scientific method itself. It presumes it. How can something use it's own process to prove it's own process? It can't.

The plaque is dated at 54 A.D, placing it during the time of Paul's journeys.<br>  <br>   - The "bitter waters" of Marah have been discovered in the Sinai peninsula. In Exodus 15, Israel could not drink the water because it had a bitter taste. Moses threw a branch into the water,and they became sweet.

AA10674998	I had just turned 14. As a new member of the youth group, I was nervously excited to go on my first church retreat for the weekend. It was February in Texas, and that meant perfect weather: warm sun, cool air and not much rain. I could not wait, little did I know that kind of LawHead surprised was waiting for me.<br>  <br>  My parents just joined the church and being a younger member of the 100+ youths in the church should have made me afraid that I would be picked upon. But, my brother was two years older and he was going also. So, bursting with curiosity, and bridled by the shyness that comes with unfamiliar territory, I headed off for the weekend.<br>  <br>  I thought that retreats were about fun, but I soon learned that our minister would have an intense lesson in store. The theme of the retreat was "Asking God for Forgiveness." Sounded fine to me. Well, at least it was a teaching about something to do, which meant that we weren't being given a bunch of stuff that we ought not do. (I was a typical youth that had very little interest in learning what I should not do.)<br>  <br>  I was told that sin separates me from God, and that as long as I have unconfessed sin, I would be separated. I was told that if I want to be near to God, then I should endeavor to remember each and every sin that is in my life. Sins of commission and sins of omission. Sin, sin, everywhere a sin-sin. I took it very seriously, and when it was time to pray, I would pause and recollect all of the sins of the day, and ask for forgiveness for each one.<br>  <br>  Well, the retreat ended on Sunday, and that Sunday night I decided to practice what I was taught. I started off, with a few sins that I could remember, and then a few more for good measure. By now, I had been praying for about 10 minuets. I wanted to stop, but I keep thinking about the sin separating me from God, so I thought harder. I wanted to make sure that I remembered all of them, and asked for forgiveness for all of them so that I would not be separated from God. In a panic I said, "Lord, please forgive me for everything that I did that was sin."<br>  <br>  Suddenly, I heard what I was saying as something very familiar. This is what people pray when they become a Christian. Had I lost my salvation? Had each unconfessed sin moved me closer to hell? If I sinned and forgot to confess, would that sin separate me from God forever? According to what I had learned: YES.<br>  <br>  I became angry and began to lash out at God. "What kind of salvation is this? What a joke! If it is up to me to maintain it, then count me out!" I shook my fist toward heaven, "I don't even want your 'salvation' it is a ridiculous curse."<br>  <br>  "I am through with you, God. You can deal with me when I die, but not here on Earth."<br>  <br>  Yes, I cursed the Gospel. I slammed Jesus and what He did on the cross. I rebelled and told God to shove it. I did all of this, serious as a heart attack.<br>  <br>  By mentioning death and after I die, I thought it best to continue. "If you want me in Heaven then fine, but I don't want you in my life."<br>  <br>  At this point I was upset, and I cried and clutched my pillow, saying all of this in my heart so I would not disturb my brother sleeping in the same room. A darkness flooded my heart.<br>  <br>  I felt empty and shattered. Giving up on the religion that was so important to my upbringing and family was tough, and I wondered if I had made a mistake. And yet I knew that I wanted nothing to do with asking for forgiveness. I am not going back, and that is what made me despair all the more.<br>  <br>  I sat wondering if my weakness is what kept me from God. Why could I not be as strong as I thought others were? My creator can never forgive me and it is because if my inability. So, were the thoughts of a burned out 14 year old.<br>  In desperation, I wept even more bitterly. With the same ferocious nature as my curse, but now with more passion and stubbornness, I lifted my eyes once more to heaven. I cannot say what flooded my mind as I sobbed, but I can only remember begging God to show me the Truth. "God! WHAT! IS! I T !?!?!?"<br>  <br>  "What is it?" … have you ever asked God that question? What is the point, what is meaning, why am I here, and where did I go wrong … rolled up into one.<br>  <br>  No sooner had I asked and the reply came. So loud and pure that a thousand trains could not drown it out … in a voice as brilliant as the white light of the sun. In clarity that four-stories of speakers could not represent … the answer came from the mouth of God, and shook my soul, as it had never quaked before. Deafened in the sound of …<br>  <br>  "TRENT, I LOVE YOU!"<br>  <br>  That is all that He said and that is all that needed to be said. It echoed for hours in my mind, and made such a lasting impression on my soul that I cry at the drop of the hat, and 14 years later, I cannot even bless the food without weeping like a baby. "I love you, thought you curse me," "I love you, though you shake your fist at heaven." "I love you, though you want nothing to do with me." I love you and and there is nothing, nothing, nothing that you can do to stop me!" "You can forsake me, but TRENT, I LOVE YOU!" It plastered me to my bed, and I curled up into the fetal position, exposed and unafraid - basking in the radical love of God.<br>  <br>  How do you perceive the love of God? Is it stubborn or fickle? Does it have anything to do with your behavior, or does it spring spontaneously from our Creator? Can you impeach the love of God by what you do? Can you invoke the love of God by what you do?<br>  <br>  What was revealed to me is tugging at your heart, you want to believe it and rely upon it. Believe it. Rely upon it. Let God love you.<br>  <br>  For years, I had tried to earn my share of God's love. But, trying to do that only pushed away the understanding of it. God's is love. It is not about how lovely I am, it is about what He is. God is love … the most concise and profound words ever uttered. God does not have love, He does not offer love, He does not fall in love, but God IS love.<br>  <br>  The love of God will always spring spontaneously from Who He is.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	God speaks to me but not in something profound or extraordinary.

Atheism is lack of belief in gods.<br>  <br>  2. You don't know what a scientific theory is.<br>  <br>  3. The big bang is not evolution.<br>  <br>  4. Argument from incredulity to the max.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	oh yes you are right.<br>  <br>  "Someone came and did it" is a great answer that atheist cant use.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	I don't believe anything.<br>  <br>  Since you show an utter lack of knowledge on any scientific topic, I shall just inform you I accept the evidence of an expanding, 14-billion year old universe that is possibly not the first expandsion after contraction. I also accept the overwhelming evidence for descent with modification by natural selection in DNA-carbon organisms, including humans.<br>  <br>  For you to understand why I accept this, you would have to leave Ken Ham and Kent Hovind's sites and go to a scientifically accurate site such as <a href="http://www.talkorigins.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.com</a> and then get back to me.<br>  <br>  Better still, you could visit Pentecostal pastor Rev.

And then you mentioned Jesus in your argument.<br>  <br>  AND someone in support of evolutionary principles just stated that abiogenesis is responsible for life in its earliest form and evolution is responsible for complex life.<br>  <br>  I think i am going to cry, the sheer ignorance wherewith advocates of both sides are pontificating and thus seeking to debate such an issue by confusing theories and using scientific impossibilities as their bargaining chips is going to drive me mad and up a bloody wall in about two seconds.<br>  <br>  I have GOT to get out of R&S today. It's going to drive me mad.<br>  <br>  To the asker: The Big Bang/Bounce Theory IS NOT and i do so repeat IS NOT the same thing as Darwinian Evolution. One pertains to the Cosmos and the Other to the Diversity of the Species and Origins thereof.<br>  Also: there are TWO kinds of evolution: micro and macro. Both the Bible and Science support micro, (as it explores evolutionary changes within the species, i.e., "according to their kinds" in relevance to adaptations to environment and genetic mutations from one generation to the next) BUT neither of the two support macro (which explores evolution above the species level and is Darwin’s main argument because it is A THEORY ONLY. No transitional forms between the species have ever been found to substantiate the validity of the hypothesis which is why it is called a hypothesis and a theory.<br>  <br>  To Lizard and others : ^^^ see above, and then please note: abiogenesis is the greatest argument for the disproving of the theory as it struck out scientifically in three consecutive centuries under controlled circumstances, therefore LOGICALLY SPEAKING a "theory" that was scientifically disproved cannot be the foundational principle behind another theory as it is incongruous and contradictory.  Please re-read 4th Grade text books concerning Pasteur, Redi, Spallanzini and so forth who scientifically disproved the possibility of abiogenesis. IF it did not work with flies and meat it does not work with human beings (or raw materials to single cell). Life only arises from other life: living matter from living matter. Abiogenesis is illogical and impossible, even once.<br>  <br>  Now if you'll excuse me ... i must go and tear my hair out after reading some of these answers. I remain embarrassed for about half of this page. Thank You.<br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  PS: Before one can intelligently argue his case, he must first know what in the bloody hell he is talking about.<br>  I see X amount of posts making grandiose claims about "The Facts" and "Truth" what they prove, yet no one has bothered to list them? Regadless of which side of the debate you are on, it would suit you well to do your own homework and actually be able to cite references of that which you are speaking. Just a thought here people.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	yes, and in my mind its loads more feasible that some great brain in the sky "intelligently designing" it all.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I see no evidence put forth by god believers for the answers they have made up to explain the existence of the universe. At this point I think the real answer is we don't know what initiated the Big Bang or what came before. I do think the answers are more likely to be naturalistic than involve a deity as many other things we formerly didn't understand and attributed to the supernatural. When religious people suggest an even more complex then the universe super being just always existed without causation itself as an explanation I think where is the evidence for such a wild assertion and wouldn't energy in some form or another always existing be more parsimonious and  in line with what we do know.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Well, I find it much more likely than some giant sky dude snapping his fingers and somehow creating plants before he created light.<br>  <br>  And our side, unlike yours, has reality to support it. Thus, I don't "believe" in it. "Believing" is what you do when you have no proof. I accept it, because the evidence supports it.<br>  <br>  By the way, The Big Bang was not the start of the universe. It was the latest expansion cycle in an endless inversion cycle the universe goes through. Big Bang -> matter -> galaxies ->solar system -> Earth -> abiogenesis -> evolution.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Argument from incredulity is not valid and neither is begging the question-fallacy.<br>  <br>  Your god isn't an answer either. There is no mention of why he should create the Universe, so your explanation isn't better at all.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	So what's your point?<br>  <br>  You want to find out how it works?

It dosen't come down to an - either or - senario for most of us.|`|3lMujNUZaa	Yes.<br>  The concept is not so hard to believe.|`|MkZC5gd6aa	No scientist has ever claimed that existence began with the big bang. The big bang was an astronomical event that shaped the universe into it's current expanding form.<br>  <br>  Your solution, religion, solves absolutely nothing. Even if you accept the premise of a creator, you're left with the same question of where that creator came from.<br>  <br>  Physics can explain a timeless universe. Nothing can explain a timeless creator.<br>  <br>  I won't even go into the evolution part right here... religion just gets more and more rediculous there.|`|pmna8fhyaa	Honestly, have you read about the big bang? Do you actually know what you're talking about?<br>  <br>  Have you read about evolution? Again, do you actually know what you're talking about?<br>  <br>  Why do you think the big bang is widely accepted by the scientific community? Why do you think it's considered valid? Hint: it is the best explanation of the origin of the universe, based on the facts we have so far discovered.<br>  <br>  Likewise, the theory of evolution is the best explanation for the diversity of life on earth.<br>  <br>  Both theories have been scrutinized, checked, verified, reviewed by scientists and they both held up to scrutiny.<br>  <br>  Neither theory requires the existence or the intervention of a god.<br>  <br>  Honestly, yes.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	I do not 'believe' it I accept it, all the evidence points to this.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	No.  It's more complicated than that.<br>  <br>  Do you *honestly* believe that the bible hasn't been subject to human agencies with political motivations?  Population control through propaganda has a strong allure, and the bible has moved through plenty of hands.  If those hands were as trust-worthy then as Catholic pedophiles are today, then do you believe that the bible is uncorrupted?  Honestly??<br>  <br>  Grow up.|`|8gveZWbHaa	No, I don't have to believe that, I just have to believe that gods don't exist.<br>  <br>  I'm quite comfortable saying "I don't know"<br>  <br>  But actually, I think that evolution, the big bang and the many, many other scientific explanations we have for the universe are a whole lot more credible than "goddidit"|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	So let me get this straight, you think that a being who is so powerful and intelligent that he is capable of creating the whole universe just popped into existence out of nowhere, completely formed and ready to go, but you find it unbelievable that over billions of years the universe could go from a single point of infinite density to what we see today?<br>  Really?<br>  Oh, and by the way, it doesn't matter how many people believe in evolution, it's the truth.  Truth isn't democratic, no matter how many people believe in your magical sky-daddy, you're still wrong, and no matter how many people disbelieve scientifically proven facts, they remain fact.|`|AA11654248	I don't have to believe anything, we don't have a fixed book that we have to blindly follow even if it'sshown to be nonsense.  Personally I believe in evolution because it's demonstrably true, but I don't have strong beliefs either way about the "Big Bang" theory.<br>  <br>  Butterflynblack : If you don't question, ie. test your faith, you faith is not going to be very strong.  How do you know your god exists ? How do you know your religion is the right one ?  Without questioning you'll never know.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	It's just as plausible a theory as believing that a god made it all in 7 days. I'm not a big believer in the big bang theory either, but there's no proof of either of them, so who is to say that you are right?|`|WbaN6osZaa	You do know that the Big Bang theory was proposed by a priest, don't you?<br>  <br>  Not an atheist.<br>  <br>  Athiest just follow it because they Hate God and think that God couldnt of made a Big Bang so they think its there idea.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	No you silly creationist.

As long as my dollar bill spends just like everybody else's, I don't see what the problem is. <br>  <br>  The U.S. founding fathers meant "freedom of religion" only to mean that there would be no laws establishing an official state religion (as there was in England).

These principles were a revolutionary departure from theocracy, autocracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and the divine right of kings.

You see, we are not actually a democratic nation in the sense of submitting all issues to majority vote.  We are a republic, a representative democracy, and we live under the rule of the Constitution as amended.  <br>  <br>  The First Amendment prohibits the establishment of any religion.  That means that a wall of separation has been built between government and religion.  The slogan on the money and the "under God" (not the "one nation") in the pledge are theist, or perhaps deist.  That means they do not establish a specific religion, but a general one that says God is real.  Even that much is a violation of the First Amendment, as has been decided in other contexts by the Supreme Court.  <br>  <br>  I do not make a big issue of these little issues, but I do fall silent when pledging allegiance and they get to the "under God" part.

e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    so you want answers from the Holy Quran or from hadiths?    Quran:    5:55:  "Only Allah is your Vali and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow."  we know (based on history and hadith) that "those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow" is Imam Ali (as), as he took his ring off and gave it to the poor person WHILE praying. so it shouldn't be a question when in our adhan we say "ash hado anna Ali (as) an vali ol Allah".  " ???????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? "  When this verse came from Allah, Prophet Muhammad immediately went to the Masjid (where all muslims in Madina was gathering mostly) and asked the people there : "Is there anybody here that helped poor poeple while he was bowing (Roku : ???? ) in his prayer ?"  they answered while pointing to Imam Ali (a) : "This man gave his Ring to me when I asked him for something during his prayer" .    5:56  "As to those who turn (for friendship) to Allah, His Messenger, and the (fellowship of) believers,- it is the fellowship of Allah that must certainly triumph."      2:207  And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah; and Allah is Affectionate to the servants      13.7  And the Unbelievers say: "Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?" But thou art truly a warner, and to every people a guide.  Many sources including some Sunni ones acknowledge that when this verse was revealed Mohammad  (PBUH)  said "I'm the warner and you, O'Ali, are the guide and through you will be guided those who are to e guided."      17:71:  "(Remember) the day when We will call every people with their Imam;...."  ---  38:43:  "And We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding"      "O Messenger! Make known that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord, for if thou do it not, thou wilt not have conveyed His message. Allah will protect thee from mankind. Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk. " Quran 5:67    After that verse came to the porphet pnuh&hf    the porphet said this :"One who has me as his master has Ali as his master.  Right after that this was sent to the prophet:  5:3:  "...This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; ..."  (this verse was sent when Mohammad (PBUH) had choosen Imam Ali (as) as the leader of muslims after him when they were coming back from the last hajj)    42:23:  "That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, (to) those who believe and do good deeds. Say: I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein; surely Allah is Forgiving, Grateful."  ---  3:61:  "But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars."

Mnm35sjNaa	That's one of the first major dilemmas of Genesis.<br>  <br>  God gave us dominion over all the other animals of the world.  He gave us intelligence.  But he doesn't want us to use it.  His one warning to Adam and Eve was to keep their grubby hands off the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Furthermore, the entire Bible has not one word in praise of intelligence.<br>  <br>  The Bible is anti-intellectual.  It clearly portrays thinking as a bad thing that only leads to distancing yourself from (the biblical) God.<br>  <br>  And that is, in reality, the truth -- if you keep free will in mind.<br>  <br>  Free will cuts to the core of scriptural veracity and reveals the contradictions, ignorance and lies that dogma tries to cover up.<br>  <br>  The concept of free will wasn't really "fleshed out" until around 400 A.D., when St. Augustine developed a doctrine of free will to make man responsible for his own actions, as well as accountable to God.  This was centuries after the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) was written.  The Bible is so riddled with free will contradictions because its authors had no concept of free will.  Everybody in those days were entirely deterministic in their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Today, most Christian denominations proclaim free will as reality, despite the fact that the Bible is really deterministic.  Although there was no concept of free will in biblical times, some verses might nonetheless be construed as promoting free will -- but one would expect that to happen in any book written by humans.  Even if we believe everything is predestined, we also experience our plans and goals being met in a directed way.  We are always willing to accept credit for our accomplishments.  This is a tacit acknowledgment of free will, despite the lack of a free will doctrine.<br>  <br>  Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)    Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)    God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)    God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.<br>  <br>  I reject that neurosis!  I say most people are basically good but sometimes make mistakes.  We were created HUMAN, not saints or angels.  Any religion built on denying our nature is an unhealthy religion.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|xfmMeJx0aa	Well, if by free will you mean that as an atheist I am not guided by a set of laws that if broken I believe I will spend an Eternity in torment, then yes I have free will. I am not good because I fear Hell. I am good because it makes life more pleasant to live. I am not good because of the consequences. I am good because it is good to be good. I make my choices because I want to. Not because I have to. I am free and my will is done accordingly.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I love how theists try to turn things around and say we atheists are out to get them or threaten them and so on and so forth. They easily forget theists bomb buildings, hijack planes to commit murder, bomb abortion clinics, fight long ideological wars, kill perceived witches, deny gays and lesbians civil rights and promote either knowingly or in ignorance an agenda of assault and insult to them, and do or have done a constant list of other atrocities, hate mongering, and attacks on all those who don't believe and behave as they do.|`|AA12383652	I dont know any Christian, personally, that believes that you have to be religious to be moral or that atheists have no morals.<br>  <br>  Freedom to choose doesnt mean freedom to decide the consequences, good or bad, of those choices.|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Anything stating "Only ___ do/are ____" is crap. Sorry.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Your question is false.  Most atheists overwhelmingly  live immorally. Have you been on this thread long? <br>  <br>  They reject God because in doing so they don't have to feel responsible for their actions.|`|cVPq3s9zaa	Mankind should throw atheists a parade.<br>  <br>  If only they knew how great we are like we do.|`|s9aTmNHQaa	Duh! The first thing you've missed is the word human instead of 'man'.|`|W7l1awFPaa	No.  God created all mankind with free will.  The devil was an angel who rebelled against God and was thrown out of heaven for it.<br>  <br>  There is always a choice, I do understand your point of view though and I agree that it certainly doesn't seem fair.<br>  <br>  Actually, I believe that everyone has free will, but Christians have access to the power of the Holy Spirit to help them make good choices, however Christians get attacked by the devil more to prevent this.  Obviously you don't have to be religious to be moral, I have a brother who is not a Christian but clearly a good man.<br>  <br>  Obviously the carrot and stick does not eliminate freedom of choice altogether since as we have seen many Christians have failed badly from time to time in their lives as I am sure anyone who watches the news is aware.<br>  <br>  The real issue is what are you going to do with the freedom of choice that God has given you?|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	I'm sorry to say that you are missing out the irony in your question. <br>  <br>  1. You can have free will and fear God at the same time. <br>  2. God will never take away your free will. He has given you independence which you have asked for. This is because of Adam ( thanks Adam you had to eat that fruit from the tree of knowledge )<br>  3. It is a choice to worship God and to do good deeds. Let me clarify this further. We are not saved by doing good deeds. There is no carrot here. We are saved whether we choose to be good or not. In fact, it is impossible to be saved by our own righteousness. Only by God's righteousness can we enter the kingdom of God. <br>  So does this mean that we shouldn't be upright? No. The Bible doesn't say that we are saved by good deeds, and here comes the but.<br>  But, we are saved FOR good deeds. Not that we are saved just for the purpose of doing good deeds but its one of the things we should be doing. <br>  The stick I presume, is Hell. I have to remind you again. There is a choice. Even as a Christian everyday I make choices. Some are good and some I regret. Yes my choice can be influenced. The thing is, I still have a choice. And so do you. <br>  <br>  I have to quote that you said God is undoubtedly evil, may I know why you have come to this conclusion? <br>  Evil is not a presence, rather, it is the absence of Good. It is when God is not there that Evil is able to occur. God did not create the Devil to manipulate beings and to cause suffering.<br>  <br>  Doing the right things is one thing. Being upright is another.<br>  Do atheists not live under a set of laws as well? True freedom doesn't come by denying all beliefs or by choosing to defy any law, or for that matter, God. <br>   I hope this clears the air about this. Please be tactful about how you choose to portray people who have beliefs in God, they are not puppets of God, they are stewards. Have a nice day.
5VmXqN6zaa	I am a Christian and I am not afraid of knowledge. Do you know everything? Are you aware that quantum physicists are desperately trying to prove that there are multiple universes, or a static universe that spawned our universe? Science needs an answer as to how the universe came into existence, and I believe that an eternal God fits the bill nicely. I think that if you honestly examine yourself, you will find that you are actually a hypocrite. Why do you take scientific theories as absolute truth? You are conditioned to. How could random genetic mutation account for the amazing order and balance in living organisms? The extinction rate of species is 98 percent while the genetic diversity on the earth changes at a REMARKABLY slow pace. Species cannot adapt genetically at the speed at which nature would require them to. Therefore I believe that doubting that the earth is billions of years old is rational. Also, the dna in even the most basic single celled organism is astoundingly complex. The notion that it could randomly assemble is almost a statistical impossibility. Even if it did, there would be an astoundingly high chance that the dna would be destroyed by the violent theoretical environment that would be needed to create an abundance of diverse amino acids. But then you might argue that there are millions of planets in the universe, and that it had to happen somewhere. I believe that that argument is flawed as well. Radiation levels are so high in most galaxies that carbon based life would be absolutely impossible. Also, our earth is so incredibly rare in that its mass is just right to have an atmosphere. Also the rotation of the earth is a big issue too. If our planet rotated 2% slower or faster, or did not have an axis at the angle it does, then life on this planet would be impossible due to extreme temperatures. <br>  When I look at the evidence, I see a strong case for a God who designed this universe, galaxy, planet, and time for life to thrive. I don't expect you to change your opinion, but please do not look down on others. I am not ashamed of my belief, and I know that I have made an intelligent choice.|`|Bi51WJd7aa	I am Christian and not the way you just described.  <br>  <br>  I think many Christians have their beliefs overshadow everything they see and when it comes down to it, all they do is 'trust their faith'.

That is also how the law is written and adhered to so nothing needs to be changed.    Women that have more than one abortion should consider getting their tubes tied along with the second abortion.    From a religious perspective it's all in God's plan right, so why worry?|`|dyf5WoHcaa	No, that would be murder. If there is a medical reason for the Dr. to end the pregnancy for the life of the mother then every effort should be made to save the life of the baby. I am against abortion as birth control and I agree with it only in very rare cases.|`|3EorUr49aa	A) I do not believe in late term abortions. That's a decision that needs to be made as early as possible.    B) No woman uses it as a form of birth control. The fact is, even if you are using a form of birth control, it can happen.     In addition I want to add that many public schools do not teach sex education. If you would like to enforce tighter policies on abortion, we need to educate young men and women.|`|AA10873763	I don't condone abortion past the point of viability.  Abortion as birth control is none of my business.  I can't imagine anyone would want to go through the procedure repeatedly as opposed to preventing conception with any of the numerous forms of contraception available, but it matters not to me how many abortions a woman has.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	defly not late term....i don't think that's right....i only believe in abortion when it's a case of rape or something similar.     i'm definitely not ok with abortion being used as a form of birth control. if you're not going to be responsible about having sex, then you shouldn't be having it.|`|37LKDbtsaa	1. No, that's wrong.  2. Abortions should never be used as a primary choice. Safe sex and carefulness are more important.|`|FmazIF6Maa	I think late term abortions or any abortions in which the baby would be viable outside the womb should be banned.    While I believe women should have a choice, I do believe they need to bare some responsible behavior. If they waited 7 months, they should just deal with it and put the kid up for adoption.    As for multiple abortions-- I would think the woman is stupid and never going to learn. But wouldn't restrict her right to early-term abortions.    I don't believe abortion is murder. So the amount of times is irrelevant. I just believe that once a fetus is viable it deserves a chance at life.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	How about looking at some facts instead of attempting to build strawman arguments.    89% of induced abortions occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy  1.1% of induced abortions occur after the 21st week of pregnancy|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Thank you for destroying the credibility of anti abortion arguments with your venom and silliness!!    The sensible people will try and carry on despite the damage caused by your type of extremism!!    You could not harm the cause more by joining the pro abortionists!!|`|7ES4xMloaa	i am ok only with first trimester abortion, after that they should put the baby up for adoption, some states will let you leave unwanted kids at a fire station no questions|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Nope, not at all. Unless it's necessary for the mother's survival.    Why, were you hoping to somehow make this a completely black and white issue in order to make us pro-choicers look stupid?|`|siTibEIGaa	First off, I would like to address your statistics. Half of all women have had it before? Where did you get this? The law has decided late term abortions are illegal and immoral, which is the general consensus among citizens throughout America. Why would a woman all of a sudden decide at late term that she doesn't want a child? How often does this happen?|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	No, I know that abortion is murder because God says that it is, but we still have to allow people to sin or not, and to choose whether they want to do it or not...  Where then would we really stop forcing people into doing what we feel is right...God even allows us choices every day, whether we want to sin or decide not to, who are we to appoint ourselves above God and decide for another person...|`|f38b3ba8ee6fe6a37654c84a1d5ac013aa	I'm still undecided, but I'm thinking that it should only be done early in the pregnancy if you do it at all. I think it's a little extreme to be using it as a birth control device...|`|9aac52bd187a4c3278570171778a711baa	i dont believe in late term abortions but people have the right to choose. if they dont want the child, they are gonna find some way to get rid of it... rather it be them throwing themselves down stairs, getting into a fight on purpose, etc.|`|jd14u32qaa	Let's clear up what 'pro-choice' means.  It means each woman has the right to choose FOR HERSELF.  I am and always will be pro-choice, but I do NOT personally agree with the act of having an abortion.  If I were female, I would never do it.  I wouldn't approve of a woman aborting my child (but she ultimately has that choice to make).  Regardless of how I feel, I think every woman needs to make that choice for herself, based on whatever morals, values, beliefs she has.  No government has the right to make that choice for her.  I'm with you, I'm not a fan of late term abortion, certainly NOT a fan of abortion as birth control, but that's ME.  Pro-life is a hard line stance (abortion is wrong for everyone) so people assume that pro-choice is the exact opposite.  You can be pro-choice and still oppose abortion, you simply support each individuals choice to decide for herself.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Of course late term abortions are not ok.  That's why they are illegal! And there are very few, if any, people who would be ok with abortion as a form of birth control.    As for the person who said that if a woman wants a child, it's a child, and if not, it's a choice, you just couldn't be more wrong.  I don't believe for one second, that this is not a well thought out thing for the vast majority of women.  As i have stated before, we are in a society where the Father of these children is allowed to walk away, and too many women (and girls) are left as single parents LONG before they have the sense to be parents at all.  Yes, i realize they got themselves into it, but they shouldn't have to do it alone, wich many of them do.  Do a little research on child abuse. Do a little research on when an abortion can LEGALLY be given, and unless you have 20 adopted kids, leave it alone!|`|URO3gDXcaa	according to your bible - god breathed life into adam.  that is when life begins.    no, at that point 'just because' is not a valid argument.  a form, yes.  not the first and only choice.|`|vAbATcTcaa	the weird thing about it , is that, if the mother wants the baby, it IS a baby to her, but if she does not want it, it is not a baby only a choice.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	If other birth control methods were more readily available abortion as birth control could be reduced to virtually nothing. A woman has the right to decide whether or not she wants to have a child. Period.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	against both|`|SHsIybhhaa	No, I only support relatively early abortions.  And no, I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control. Not much that can be done there though.|`|yAvTxh47aa	1. Late term abortions are currently only done because a woman's DOCTOR deems it required, so this is nonsense. You don't get to second guess someone else's doctor, you don't have the knowledge.    2. I prefer birth control being used as birth control. Unfortunately, some people think counting days is birth control.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Here's an answer for all you die hard, bigoted anti abortionists----yes.|`|KleF4mohaa	Only if there is a health related rationale to support that decision.|`|SY3aYLMraa	I am pro-choice but agree the current UK cut-off date, which is 24 weeks I believe, should be lowered to around 10-15 weeks.    As a father to a 5 month old, I felt different physical responses from my unborn daughter depending upon what was happening.  She even jiggled around to the sound of my voice when I came home from work.    So yes, I agree that the abortion cut-off should be a lot sooner than it is.    However, I do not agree that abortion is used as a form of birth control with anyone, and I believe you are just making a crass generalisation.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	I have only found 1 person in my life that believes in late term abortions, and zero that use it as a primary form of birth control.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	I'm a die-hard pragmatist. No, I don't like the idea of late term abortions. I believe there should be limits. As for prior abortions, I also don't think I have the right to tell a woman how many times she can terminate pregnancy. I wish abortions didn't have to happen. I wish people were wiser and taught safe sex and birth control as a virtue so that there would be fewer unwanted pregnancies. But until then, I will fight for every woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. For me, it's the lesser of two ills.|`|CAQL94vGaa	This is going to be a never ending debate. I ride the fence line on this question only b/c if i were to have a kid right now, i am financially unstable (due to college) therefore i would very much appreciat not having a kid. but, i also believe it is very wrong to do and the fact that my gma would kill me if i had an abortion. so for all's sake, lets not have kids!|`|zWj6HXHNaa	On a personal level no.

Good Job sir ^_^|`|MgMsMExPaa	If you are ok with gay people then you will never be intimidated by them. Maybe you could go out and eat with one of them sometime and discuss this over dinner. Just make it known that you will be going to pay for your own meal so that he is not mislead. It would be no different than eating with one of your buddies other than the comments about your attractiveness etc.|`|OdovbvSYaa	im a straight guy and had that a few times, mostly it was quite nice just explained im straight and even had a drink and a chat. im pretty comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  just once i had a young guy get very aggressive with me, called me ignorant just cos i said i wasnt interested! then he kept coming back up to me and trying it on and getting aggressive again. in the end the security threw him out thankfully. obviously he was a bit umm unstable.|`|gBPP0HEuaa	Its alright man I went with a couple of friends to a club one time...i found out halfway through the hour long drive that it was a gay bar. Now im no homophob so it didn't bother me. BUT my hair was all gelled up and I was wearing a pink polo with tight pants. I got my butt pinched and a pro drag queen hit on me. When i declined him and said that i was straight, she told me i was to cute to be straight. My point here is Its definitely a compliment and theres nothing to be weirded out about. Gay men are (in my experiences) viewed as attractive by women....so maybe if that guy looked at you and said "damn" then there were some women around thinking the same thing|`|M8RLtUQTaa	Get used to it.

I've been hit one a couple times by gay or bisexual men, and honestly it didn't bother me at all.  After the fact I never really thought about it.  Like you said it was really kind of flattering the same way it would have been if a woman was hitting on me.  I mean seriously what's the difference?  It is a compliment when someone of either sex, (including transgendered), finds you attractive, it makes you feel good/wanted, which is all good.   <br>  <br>  If someone is obnoxious about it the same things apply, I just ignore the person man or woman.  I hope you enjoyed the drink and at least had a decent quick conversation.  That's what I do and just let them know, " hey I'm flattered but I prefer women".  That has always been well received for me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  I just ducked back to look at this question, and am happy to see all the thumbs down for the bigot/bigots.

tW86bOMNaa	Strictly, paedophilia is the performance of a sexual act with any person younger than the statutory age of consent within the state in which the act took place.<br>  <br>  So, it would depend on the age of consent at the place (and of course, the period) that Mohammed did this.<br>  <br>  Generally, it's usually best not to try and project our current legality structures back into historical periods. In England, for example, for many centuries it was usual for marriages to occur at an age that we would now find wholly unpalatable. But during ages when life expectancy was so low, it was usually best to try and establish marriages - and thereby family lines - much, much younger than now. 14 or even 12 years of age was not an usual age for people to be married in those days. But 9 may well have been pushing it slightly...|`|gBoUrlrKaa	It's false, because pedophilia is actually a sexual dysfunction where the person achieves sexual arousal or satisfaction only through the sexual exposure of children.<br>  <br>  He did not marry her because he wanted sex, he married her for political reasons. All his other wives were old widows.<br>  <br>  I think it was sick and morally wrong, but not pedophilia exactly.|`|r3fmXySlaa	I think Mohammed was a weirdo for liking sex with a small child.

Mnm35sjNaa	Nobody knows anything whatsoever about ANYTHING supernatural.  That is an indisputable fact (although people will try anyway).  God and heaven are both supernatural.  Anybody who claims to know anything about either is lying or delusional.  Period.    If God wants to be worshiped, does he want to be worshiped as Allah, Zeus, Yahweh, Jesus, Jim Jones, or Marshall Applewhite?  And if God is a trinity, how come people don't worship the Holy Spirit as often as God or Jesus?  If God is the lawgiver, do we follow Biblical laws or Koranic laws?  If God's word is immutable, can he cancel his own laws (dietary laws, for example)?  If God cursed Eve's descendants (i.e. all of mankind) with death, is Jesus' offer of redemption a kind of supernatural loophole for God's death sentence?    If you claim scriptural authority for supernatural claims, how can you know anything about the supernatural beyond what scripture claims?  When various religions claim scriptural truth, how do you decide which is true?    All these issues point to the fact that people believe what they want to believe.  Some prefer truth.  Others prefer the fairytales they've been taught since childhood.    It's interesting that, as children, we recognize at an early age that supernatural entities like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and magical unicorns are all nonsense.  Yet, so many adults cling to supernatural beings (God) and places (heaven) and books (scripture) -- despite the lack of any evidence whatsoever.    The question isn't, "Does God want to be worshiped?".  Like everything else we humans do, it's a matter of free will: you'll believe in the supernatural if you want to.|`|AA11849917	WHAT?  What nonsense is THIS?  Come on!  This is such a pathetic straw man, it's not even funny any more!    Why not ask, "If apples grow on trees, why don't elephants fly?" and "Since elephants do NOT fly, why do apples still grow on trees, anyway?"    That's what your question sounds like - total nonsense and gibberish!    It can't be answered, because it's so ludicrous to begin with!    God sent plagues as judgement on Pharoah - God said to the children of Israel, "They that touch you, touch the apple of my eye!"  In other words, don't mess with God's kids!  He won't tolerate the neighborhood bully!  If you GIVE it, be prepared to take it!  Pharoah was already killing all the first born males of the children of Israel!  "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime!"  They were getting their just rewards - they did to others, now God was gonna do back to them!      You getting it yet?  Is ANY thing sinking in?  I know it's hard for water to sink into concrete, but I'm hoping your brains aren't THAT hard, yet!    You asked another stupid question, "To whom does he pray for forgiveness?"  You answer this, first:  To whom does a judge have to ask forgiveness from when he has to send someone to prison?    HE-LLOO-OOO - He doesn't!!!!  DUH! and DOUBLE DUH!    Who are YOU to judge God, as though you were holy and righteous and eternal?  Where does the clay get off criticizing the one who molds it?  What right does the clay have to say to the one who molds it, "What have you made?"  Are you REALLY as foolish as all that?  Your question sure implies as much!  If you were to break a serious law, and the jury finds you guilty, would YOU dare tell the judge off, the way you're telling off God?  What kind of fool would even DO that kind of thing, anyway?  Well, that's exactly what you did!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That is not even a logical statement. Worship..plagues of locusts..and the connection is what...In your head only, that's what.

If you are an Atheist and do not believe in an immortal soul then it is.    But Christians believe that we all have an immortal soul and that going to hell is the worst thing that can happen to a person.    They seem to forget that Christians believe that life does not end with death but that we will spend eternity with God in heaven.

Clearly you are comfortable with this within your group,  however others may feel differently.  <br>  <br>  I think generally in a social setting most people would see this kind of behaviour as odd but not inappropriate however a few may feel uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  In a work setting I think it could be construed as inappropriate,  but I figure in the workplace that any physical contact should be kept to a minimum.|`|1VIwo0rNaa	Don't worry about what people outside your social circle will think. <br>  If you feel comfortable doing that then of course it's appropriate.

2UjheafFaa	You'll never know for a certainty, unless he tells you or you find out by some other means, BUT we can use your clues to paint a very good picture. Remember, assuming makes an *** out of you.    a) He hangs out with a lot of girls: A lot of straight men are uncomfortable with the idea of socializing with girls outside a sexual context. Also, many men are intimidated by the presence of other girls, and are much more inclined and feel much more at ease, and enjoy themselves more around their guy friends. Your friend just may not have that uncomfort, or more he may just be a straight up PIMP. Kudos.     b) He said no: A lot can come out of his answer; you can analyze more accurately than I. Biggest question... Was he surprised when you asked? If he treated it as a normal question, he may be gay. Any straight man would be completely taken off-guard and shocked. He may just be somewhat of a metrosexual, and know the aura he gives off. If his answer was simply and calmly "no," I would raise an eyebrow.    c) The friend that said he's gay: He only said that to counter his inner- homosexual tendencies to feel more hetero. Just kidding. You should take nothing and feel no influence on that.    d) Your bullet list: All include minor stereotypes of sexuality. I'm straight, not a pervert, yet I've slapped a few asses in my time. I like animals, I'm usually more chill so I'm not usually annoying, but sometimes a bit of a goof. The biggest red flag was him actually enjoying cooking at other people's houses. MOST straight men like to establish some type of masculinity with more unfamiliar people. They certainly wouldn't throw themselves out there in a more unfamiliar setting, and take on a more womanly task such as cooking.     Listen, you have to analyze this for yourself. I gave you a few things to look out for, and I would probably think a bit more in depth, but I'm feeling a bit lazy. You won't know for certain, until you 'know,' so treat him the same and don't ultra-judge him. Sounds like an alright guy.|`|R7smL5mQaa	You can't tell whether someone is gay just by looking at them or how they act and the only person that can confirm whether someone is gay or not is is the actual person themselves (and then still they could lie about it).|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Im sorry but you cant judge based on what you just said, There are alot of straight men who like to cook, like animals (guy vegetarians obviously), and annoying, and being a good student.

Ok, so I paraphrased a little.|`|de711i5Vaa	The Bible only says that Children are a Blessing. No where does it say that you MUST have Children. Although God did say your responsibility is to "be fruitful and Multiply".|`|7kJFmyxdaa	The Bible does say that God wants us to be blessed with children. In Genesis 1:28   God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground." And again in Psalms 127:4-5    Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in ones  youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.    But God also wants us to be responsible with these children since in fact they are His children first. Now if you are not ready for this responsibility then I would not have children. As far as your in laws are concerned the decision is not theirs, it is yours.     What you need to do is sit down with your husband with a clear and open heart and mind and discuss between the two of you how you feel about having children. Communication between the two of you is the key.|`|Y0V5qH7Waa	the bible does not say you must have children and to have children for the wrong reasons (your husband told you to) could hurt more than just you the id will be hurt as well|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	No it is not wrong. I would not bring any innocent children into this world the way it is today and what is to come.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	There is nothing in scripture that commands you to have children.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Your husband is reprehensible and his family should mind their own damn business.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Your husband's family is using their religion to try to get you to do what your husband wants.  If Christians have to have children then the apostle Paul wasn't a good Christian.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God says be fruitful and multiply , but nowhere does God give a commandment that you have to have children...the problem now is that your husband wants them and the bible says that when you are married that you become one...so now you really have a problem...  I think that if you really want to serve God and want to be in His will then seek God for an answer and pray together you and your husband and seek God for an answer in this...see what God wants for the two of you, He always will tell you what is best for you...so don't leave God out of your marriage...include Him and He will direct your path...guaranteed....|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	"NO."  Do what is in your heart. If you do not want children then do not have them.  There is nothing wrong with not having children.  There are countless women in this world that have other callings besides having children.  Don't allow others to persuade you to do something you do not want to do just because of what "they want."    Have children when you are "sincerely" ready to have them within your own heart and not because someone else wants you to have them against your will.  That is pitiful.    How absolutely pathetic that they are saying "you must."  How very christian of them.....|`|DYnvacFVaa	In the Bible it tells us to multiply, how ever i dont think every christian needs to have children, we dont rely on it for the human race to continue, im 24 and married and i have no intention on having kids, if God wants me to have kids then i figure he will put it in my heart to have them, until then i dont plan on having any.  If its in your plan then you will want to have them or it will happen.|`|Ya8SWdysaa	You should only have a baby if your ready for the responsibilties and are ready for the commitment.|`|91209421c4b4fddcb6129f9556673898aa	it's not in the Bible.|`|HakCVqMdaa	i dont know about christianity but in islam its kinda wrong because ur supposed to bring more people in the religon|`|dz2YYh7Saa	If you are not ready to have children, then don't.

No, it's not wrong not to have children.|`|entRyNolaa	as long as you never have sex, since that is the real distraction and unimportant priority in many peoples lives anyway....kids are great, much less of a hassle than the burden of trying to feel good via sex...thats kinda weird|`|GEfUTyi8aa	who cares what the bible says.... we dont need anymore unwanted children on the planet.. if you dont want them dont have them... you will resent them... and that is so unfair, they are innocent.... that would be very un-christian like in my opinion.... its your marriage not his familys.... dont even go there... its not right to have children for the sake of making someone happy, you have to raise them.. you have to give up a lot of yourself to do it right.. thats the problem these days.. people think having a child is like having a handbag.. then they realize they are there for life.. you are sleep deprived, you have to juggle your wants with theirs.. many get resentful and some abuse..... cant take the pressure.    Dont do it unless you really want to and understand that raising kids is like creating a little person and everything you do affects what they do in life....|`|x9VdD7GUaa	It is not wrong at all.  A lot of time the absence of a family to take care of can lead you to mission for God in places that you may not other wise deem fit to go.  The decision to have children is between you and your husband alone and it is up God to grant you them.  Believe me if he thinks you need kids it does not matter what you do you'll get them.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	You both need to see a counselor.  You feel betrayed (maybe) that your husband has changed his mind about children, even though you both agreed not to have any.    You don't need to have children.  There are many ways to care for others without having children of your own.  However, if you and your husband feel differently on this VERY important issue, then you need to discuss this with either your counselor or priest.    Forget about your husband's family.  They need to stick their noses in their own business.    Your husband is the one you should care about.  He may grow to resent you for keeping him from having children of his own.  AND you may grow to resent him from forcing this issue on you.      Take care of this situation now, before it gets worse.  AND BELIEVE ME, it will.

Usually, they desire to contact a loved one that they have lost or some simply harbor a fascination with death or the dead. When one wishes to reconnect with the presence of someone they have lost, they may turn to methods involving communication with the dead.     When one is interested in contacting the dead, there are a few techniques that can be followed, according to a Dr. Raymond Moody, who claims to be quite an expert when it comes to near-death experiences, as well as the afterlife. Moody suggests a technique that was used during ancient times for those who wanted to receive a vision. It is said that Nostradamus used this approach when he was foretelling the future. It simply involves a large mirror, as well as a variety of suggestions to ensure a positive and successful line of contact. Below you will find a checklist to follow when you want to attempt communication between the dead.     1) To gain a clear state of mind, one should refrain from consuming products that contain dairy and caffeine the day before an encounter is attempted. Fruits and vegetables should be the only simple foods that are consumed.     2) When attempting to contact the dead, you should position yourself in the quietest section of your dwellings. Watches and jewelry should be removed; loose clothing should be worn. Relaxation is the key for those who wish to contact the dead. Distractions, such as clocks and phones should be unplugged. When complete silence is achieved, a large mirror should be placed in front of you. The mirror should be at an angle that promotes comfortableness.       3) If you are having trouble reaching an altered state of mind, looking at artwork or listening to calming music can achieve a sense of awareness conducive to this type of act.     4) If you are trying to contact a loved one, you should surround yourself with some of their photographs, as well as their personal items. Touching the objects will bring you closer to who you are trying to contact. Some of the items you may choose to set about you may include family films, photo albums, old letters, glasses, a piece of their clothing, as well as a few of their favorite things. Anything that evokes feelings or memories should be used.     5) Light a candle and put it behind you. When dim light is used, it is best that it be placed behind your body. It is said that twilight hours is the best time to communicate with the dead because many people experience altered states. Some can mirror gaze surrounded by bright lights, but this takes time to get use to, as well as achieve.     6) When you are ready to mirror gaze, you should be in a comfortable, relaxed position. You will gaze into the mirror without trying to see anything; it will be similar to looking at something that is located far from view. You may start to feel a tingling within your fingertips.     7) The mirror may seem cloudy after some time, while others have reported that the mirror becomes darker in color. When things within the mirror do not seem as clear as they did before, you may be ready to experience contact with the dead.     8) Complete silence should still be maintained. Allow yourself to view the images that appear to you within the mirror (if you are lucky to experience this phase). The images that you may encounter will probably last for only less than a minute. Some people are able to view images for as long as 10 minutes, but this may take some time to develop. Sometimes you may not see a thing, but will instead hear the voice of your loved one. Some have claimed to actually feel their touch. Experiences with mirror gazing can be quite varied.|`|de711i5Vaa	you can't. sorry for your loss. May God Bless you|`|HchGJp3oaa	You can talk but they wont talk back...sorry|`|7ES4xMloaa	no but you can talk to someone who will lie pretty well if you give them money|`|wuPTBIIuaa	get your cousins name submitted in the lds temple through the mormon church and baptism by proxy will be performed, and you wont have to seek out a medium which can be a fraud in most cases. and He will be knocking on your door. you wont have to do anything.   but it actually comes down to your faith, and your prayers.   and the will of God.     if its allowed you will be visited. if its satanic, any medium will do, and it will most definitely be there to misguide you.    jobsyesporkno, might be more correct than i give him credit for. but one must debate whether "anyone" has died since jesus or not. and one must consider whether the Prison doors were opened "wide" or if only some still remain. before the atonement death reigned, total darkness for some. spirit prison for others.   the reason i say check out the mormon baptism "route" is that there might be MORE to communication from the deceased than just faith and prayer but action works and redemption. the bible does speak about baptism for the dead! and if the dead can come and communicate with us, and its NOT ALL afraud, maybe baptism by proxy will set someone free and you can get a blessing and a testimony.     but i wouldnt trust any medium, and if a spirit does come to you, remember the bible warns us to "try" the spirits and "test" them. to see where the origin they come from and why they are there!    i had a dream/vision where i saw one that looked like george carlin. but he was standing behind 2 others. i think the symbolism was that he could only visit me if there was a process by which the other two had to agree. he was dressed in white just as the others were. so I think he has forgiveness on the other side.   i am just saying what happened i cannot say what it actually was.|`|FmazIF6Maa	It's best to let the dead rest and move on.     They'll come for you one day. Until then let it be.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I don't believe that you can talk to spirits, but, if you want to, check into a seance.   As far as asking about her mother. When someone is passing, sometimes they are a little delusional. Latoya could have been hallucinating about being with her mother since death was on her mind. As we have been taught when we are Christians we will see our loved ones in Heaven. She may have been so in tuned to her upcoming death, that her mother was first and foremost on her mind.|`|IHIiyyCTaa	You could find a medium.

But, since you are on the R&S site I feel I have to tell you that your cousin is dead and is not in Heaven with your aunt or anyone else.    The Bible is very clear that we the living are not to have anything to do with the dead or . . .    Psychics, Seerers, Mediums, Seances, Spiritualist etc. The Almighty says that these people do tricks from Satan and are not to be consulted or trusted.    It is very dangerous to have dealings with Satan and his demons and that's what some of these forbidden people communicate with.    But, you can rest assured that Messiah will be coming back soon to retrieve His Church.    Both the living and the dead will be called by Yeshua and all things upon the earth will wail His Name and see His coming.    I pray for you to have Peace with the will of the Almighty God and that your cousin received the Saving Power of the Christ before she died.    Be Blessed:-)|`|XpZumlkwaa	You really can't because he/she is sleep.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	You cant and dont try.

Most times, I'll start praying and begin talking to my grandma. When I do this, unusual things happen, too. A family photo will fall, or my alarm radio will just kinda turn on by itself, with a song related to the person.     Its not just in private either. Have you ever remebered a time where you just had a PARTICULAR someone on your mind so tough, and something SIGNIFICANT in your day will happpen, that's realted to THAT person? Not weird, that's God and the spirits....    All in all, the best source you have for this kind of communication is through the Holy Spirit. I have been taught, and researched, that although the ouji board is a straight path to the spirits, its NOT direct. By that I mean you may channel other spirits while attepting to reach only one, and some of those may be evil. Anyway. all you have to do is believe.    I hope my input helps. Most folks would probly say im smokin' sumthin, but I know for a fact that when i need the presence of my Grandma, I can feel it there. Just believe...

This not counting the countless other concubines and female slaves he had in his possession. <br>  <br>  And if a man is allowed 4 wives at a time, let's say if he already has first wife, and wanted to take another wife, wouldn't he already be committing adultery with the second one since they would have to date in one form or another before they got married? even so, he's already committing adultery against his first wife if he should look at another woman with the intention to possess her.|`|QJ19OBCbaa	I believe you not Iranian.

You can't tell me that in the 1400 years islam has been around that in any part of the world, 6 year olds were considered women. Oh and thats another thing. When you inter mix reigion and culture, it gives you an interesting advanatge in a discussion on the topic. You can claim culture or you can claim religion, but you never hear a muslim criticize the practice that their false prophet himself subscribed to. They should have flogged mohammed.|`|K8IJXzVjaa	The Qur'an gives mankind an excellent Shariah law to follow. Sex is now so prevalent in Western societies like America such that the average American indulges in eight sexual relationships before settling with a spouse (in marriage). Thus, the punishment of flogging the Adulterers is a just punishment for those who transgress God's boundaries. You have the choice to marry anyway, so why not wait a couple of years for sexual intercourse. Anyway, a couple which intends upon marrying is less likely to separate for silly matters like what happens in girlfriend-boyfriend relationships.<br>  <br>  [4:16]   The couple who commits adultery shall be punished.

You may say you believe in God but you are seeking something or someone else other than Him. I remember once I had this huge fear of death, because I truly felt I was gonna die, and then I was revising in my head this sentence: I cannot die now, there is still something that I need to get to.  This is when I truly started seeking God, I may have said I believed in Him before, but it was only a superficial belief, it did not get into my heart. It needs more to let it get into your heart, you must work really hard on it.   This is what I do now, which is why I have more peace at the thought of death, because I am preparing myself for it.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	That's easy! Have you ever read the Bible?

It is the nature of all humans to fear death and want to stay alive in their bodies as long as possible. The lost man that rejected the payment the Lord Jesus Christ made on the cross for their sins has a special fear when they are on their death bed. They cry out to God but it to late. They know that they are going to left up their eyes in hell. Luke 16: 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments.

A1aIOZAkaa	"Nazi" refers to the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, led by Adolf Hitler. They were a political group in Germany from 1919-1945. Nazism is generally considered to be a form of Fascism.<br>  <br>  "Jews" are an ethnic group belonging to the religion of Judaism. Judaism is considered to be an Ethnoreligion, because anyone born into the religion by a Jewish mother is considered Jewish, even if they do not actually follow the religion. Also, people can formally convert to the religion and be considered Jewish if they follow it (even if they have no Jewish parentage). Jews originally came from the ancient Middle East. They now live all over the world.<br>  <br>  "Gypsies" are another ethnic group. The term "Gypsy" refers to many different ethnic groups, but most commonly to the Roma. The Roma are an ethnic group who originally came from India, and now live mostly in Europe. They are known for their nomadic lifestyle (they travel from place to place).<br>  <br>  Hitler and the Nazis saw the Jews and the Gypsies as inferior races, and wanted to rid the world of them. No one can really explain Hitler's reasons for wanting to kill the people of these ethnic groups.<br>  <br>  For more information, see:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_peop...</a>|`|jJxUCkkFaa	Gypsies is a common but incorrect name for Roma (also known as Roma/Sinti,also other names ) people a minority found in the Europe and elsewhere .Their  (Roma people)ultimate origin is India, .

The religion is thousands of years old so too much back story there to go into. <br>  Gypsy are generally Romani and the lived a nomadic life, meaning they didnt live in houses etc they moved around.

cdy5uIE5aa	No we don't have to prove anything.  Let's say someone rushed into the room yelling that a pink elephant was charging down the hallway.  You wouldn't (or shouldn't) believe them, the burden of proof is on them to provide.  <br>  <br>  Things don't exist just because we say they do.  They have to be proven to exist.  Until then they shouldn't be believed.<br>  <br>  Besides, you can't prove something doesn't exist, you can only prove that it does.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Yes, Which is impossible, Which is why in reality, There is no such thing as a true atheist, Only agnostics, For no one can prove their is no God. Richard Dawkins who claims to be an atheist has admitted to this himself in saying he doesn't know there isn't a God , Which in reality make him an agnostic. God bless.|`|KBZNraEaaa	Depends on the atheist. If he's a gnostic atheist (meaning that he KNOWS there is no god) then he has to justify his position. But if he's an agnostic atheist, one that does not believe in any god but also admits that some god(s) may exist, then he does not have to prove anything.|`|0AxXQ1Jeaa	No, we don't have to for that very reason. The burden of proof is on those who claim the positive.<br>  <br>  EDIT: LOL@Coleslaw! I'll play along with you, all right. So what you're saying is that atheism is a theory claiming that the theory of a deity (or more) is not true, and that we have to prove that our theory that your theory is wrong is the correct one *head spinning*<br>  <br>  We don't have to disprove something that isn't proven in the first place. Geez.|`|42pr8akBaa	It is impossible to prove a negative.

There ain't no way to prove either side of the argument!|`|rGEZup0Zaa	No, we don't, for exactly that reason.<br>  <br>  Atheism is lack of belief, not a definitive denial, so the burden of proof doesn't attach itself.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	Think of it this way.<br>  <br>  We're all seeking happiness.  It is just that we don't all share the same idea of what happiness is.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, I think that ultimate happiness and joy and peace must reside in our Creator (if He exists).  If He exists, He created us and gave us our ideas about love and justice and mercy and compassion, which I think makes Him good.  If He exists, He must have had a reason so He holds the key to the meaning and purpose of my life.<br>  <br>  So I see Him as the key to ultimate happinesss and so I seek Him.  That's what belief is for, i.e. to honestly seek Him even not knowing for sure if He even exists.<br>  <br>  Now other people see their happiness as being able to live their lives without anyone telling them how to live their lives.  They see happiness as independence of God and so do not seek Him even not knowing for sure that He doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  We have to live our lives and so no one can be an agnostic.

Some girls like cheesy guys and some don't depending on what she likes plan accordingly.    Be romantic. Tell her she is beautiful (I love when my guy tells me I'm beautiful)   Be subtle with the asking out but not too subtle that she thinks you're joking.  Most of all be sensitive, some what mushy, and tell the truth. Don't start off the relationship with a bunch of lies.  And if you want buy her a necklace or a bracelet. Something  that she can keep and remember not only the day you became an item but your first Valentines day together.  Flowers are nice but they die. You don't want to make her think that your gift symbolizes the relationship. Aka it's pretty now but it will die and go away after a few weeks even days.  Good luck.  ---my boyfriend said he would get me in your circumstance "some candy or chocolates and a single red rose asking 'will you be my valentine?'"  You decide. haha.|`|gG97FHQ6aa	Yeah dont ask your dad. I always found that hard. But you should get her somthing that reflects on her. If she has a hobby... use that(like bowling). You can also ask her out by asking her to go for a walk and then sitting down with her somwhere quiet and asking her.|`|uNizUHJVaa	flowers are always good.  every girl enjoys getting pretty flowers  and they're probably in your budget  plus a small card    if you want to ask her out, talk about how she would feel about it with her (:|`|RIhfYG0Saa	get her a pretty necklace and some chocolate, don't get flowers they're to common.|`|jaw51Z5Waa	ok well, i'm a girl......i'm 13 by the way    you could get her chocolates.. they always work!!!  or some nice roses... by the way make sure that you wrap them up neatly, girls hate scruffy men!    If you want to ask her out just be yourself be cool and casual and if she says no then just keep trying!    hope this helps!|`|vQmO3N6Raa	just get her something simple, beautiful, yet affordable.    like a sterling silver heart necklace.  you can get cheap jewelry at kohl's or walmart. and you can also add one single white rose. =]    or if she isnt that kind of person...Make her a nice mix CD. =]    and girls like it ALOT more if you make the move first, ask her in PERSON, so it doesn't make you seem like a wussy.    i'm sure it'll make her happy. =]|`|ccFeMoFbaa	Don't spend all your money on her! You can get her something very nice without spending all your money. I agree, a necklace could be nice. I don't see anything wrong with getting her flowers. I am 24 years old and I still love getting flowers! Just get her something small. she will appreciate it just as much as a more expensive present. If you want to ask her out you can give her a card with the present that you get her and ask her in the card. Sometimes it can be easier to write these things instead of saying them...
3xlDwlkhaa	Excerpted:<br>  <br>  As we come to this discussion of the Universe, the question of "How?" remains a great mystery. Much of the background work we have already done. The Universe is in God's mind. It has come from, is passing through, and remains within God's mind. Yet how does this all happen?<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  The First Moment of Creation: God's Essence -<br>  <br>  The first moment of creation is when God's mind thought upon itself as the Self-Established One, the I will be that will be I. In the first moment of creation God's mind had nothing outside of itself to contemplate, nothing outside of itself to be amused by, and nothing outside of itself for distractions. So there was only the reality within God's mind, and it forever remains within God's mind.<br>  <br>  The first moment of creation therefore, is when God begins to contemplate Essence.<br>  <br>  The first manifestation from God is God's own thoughts and meditations upon God's Essence.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Deeper, Slower Layers of Consciousness -<br>  As God continues to meditate on Essence, the Mind of God places upon the Original Thought deeper and deeper layers of Consciousness. Out of this 'Fluctuation of NRJ' all forms are created. This endless NRJ combines and collects into different forms according to a pre-established pattern.<br>  <br>  The Universe forms whole and complete from beginning to end, but this is not something that happens instantaneously. Within the Illusion of gradual unfolding, God is still happening. God is Becoming God. Through Perception, God's NRJ gains experience. It bears witness to the unfolding and learns.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  In short, when God finds God, the First becomes the Last.|`|bmueOdvPaa	The definition of god equals omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal etc. (And don't forget that god is a nonsensical man-made construct invented by a ruling elite to give moral justification to their oppression of others).  <br>  <br>  More to the point, why would he be looking for himself if he is such a perfect entity/being? Why must you speak when you obviously have nothing to say nor ask?|`|VDdEMPsdaa	He is not lost, lol!

In the same way the mind can perceive many things but it never perceive itself. This is true for the one mind of God. the solution seems to be to fragment in to many minds. Thus each mind can perceive the others like a finger tip can touch other finger tips. This is cause of creation. So that the One Mind can perceive itself and thus gain true insight ~Siva _()_<br>  <br>  Hmmm...|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	he will reach Nirvana ?<br>  he wins at hide and seek ?
Nxolwd5Baa	because if everyone knew that it was the failsafe, the off switch for this 'game' we are playing they would probably do it, of course when they woke up they would realise that they had chosen this particular reality cos its pretty good all things considering and maybe have to wait to get back in.|`|K1EZh63Yaa	Because the ones that look at suicide negatively are the ones that don't understand it, so they judge and condemn it.  The ones that commit suicide obviously don't live to tell and explain why, even though they seem to have had a valid reason at the moment.  It's all opinionated, just depends who it's coming from, victim or accuser.<br>  <br>  What if the person that is considering suicide believes that they can't be helped and they feel as if they are a threat to society and want to leave to benefit the rest physically and mentally?  It's their CHOICE isn't it.  I mean, what's the point of freewill if we can't kill ourselves?<br>  <br>  If you think about it, what's the point of living anyway?  Being a slave to the emotions we've been given and asking for forgiveness, yeah right!  All we do is contribute to the never ending cycle of death because thats what we were constructed to do.  Maybe there's a day we all dissolve into nothingness.<br>  <br>  We obviously have the authority, it's just getting the balls to "go forth and die." - Dethklok|`|0109ed0c62f90fd240f61d40fe8209acaa	I don't understand either. People say its selfish, and its wrong. Those people have never had those feelings and I don't think anyone should judge anyone else if they have not been in there shoes. I say that if I want to take my own life, I should be able to. Its not weak to take your own life. Its takes courage to kill yourself.

Why quit when you are losing?<br>  <br>  Talk to others such as social workers and ministers. You can learn to enjoy helping others. That helps them and helps you feel better.<br>  <br>  You have a relative or friend somewhere you can help.

It wont be heaven because you just took yourself back from God and said that you knew better.  Life has much more value than you give it credit.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Because of the aftermath it leaves behind.  People who are left behind are left in despair and are heartbroken.

Morons say "Oh, it will just pass, silly" and "Oh you're just being selfish"<br>  <br>  These statements, of course only serve to EXACERBATE the suicidal's sense of hopelessness.<br>  <br>  @CLIVE "February 22nd will mark the four year anniversary of my friend's death by suicide.

The former things have passed away.”<br>  To God, death is a very temporary situation...He can overturn it any time he likes. <br>  So committing suicide is like being rude to God. And shows a weakness in our character.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Because if you believe in God the Father, you must not take your own life or it is a sin and you will be punished in Heaven.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Because you have to clean them up afterwards...<br>  it's even harder work if they blow their brains all over the wall... Do us a favor and just sleep with the fishes.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Several reasons:<br>  <br>  If you believe that life is a one shot deal, then suicide is murder - even if the person you have chosen to murder is yourself - and no one has a right to take another life, even their own.<br>  <br>  If you believe that life here is just passing through on an eternal cosmic journey, then a person who commits suicide throws away their chance to learn and evolve during their incarnation here, and is therefore giving up a valuable opportunity. <br>  <br>  It's OK to move from one house or country to another, but no matter where you go there you are - you still have to live with yourself. When you change your environment, who you are does not change. When you commit suicide, who you are not only changes, but is terminated.<br>  <br>  However, I think the biggest taboo against suicide comes from the fact that it is ultimately a selfish act, because when someone kills themselves the people who loved them are always devastated. They always feel either guilty that they let that person down, or were unable to help, or they feel mystified because that person did not reach out to them or because they didn't even realize that the person was suffereing. So, for the one who commits suicide, the pain is over but for their loved ones the pain goes on.<br>  <br>  If you read reports of people who have comitted suicide and been resuscitated, they always say that they realized too late that they had made a terrible mistake. Near Death Experiences by suicide victims say the say thing and they report realizing in the afterlife that they were careless with a tremendous opportunity that they did not appreciate at the time.|`|F8E9JpmSaa	Ok here we go again. February 22nd will mark the four year anniversary of my friend's death by suicide. I had the misfortune of discovering his hanging, bloated. stiff, blue and smelly body. Why is it looked upon so negatively? What these cowards who do succeed fail to realize is that once they are gone they leave a big bag of $hit behind for the living to clean up. You have to answer questions why they did what they did and of course you are asking those same questions yourself. I mean what did we do to deserve this I'm not the one who committed suicide but yet I have to clean this guys mess. So no it's not perfectly understandable if you want to leave unless you make it as painless as possible for the ones you leave behind to clean up after you.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	because the people left behind to look upon it are heartbroken and confused.<br>  <br>  its like moving to the city and leaving alone a dozen penned-up farm animals that rely on you to feed them.|`|UmNiOF1Uaa	I'm keep seeing words here like "weak" and "coward".

The Midwest has a slightly different accent from the West and the South is very different from the Northeast. Southern accents are slower, like how Forrest Gump speaks. New York/Jersey accents are fast and abbreviated with lots of references to things you might not know, analogies or something like that. Watching movies really doesn't help that much. You need to actually talk to people if you want to learn their linguistics, then you can ask questions like "why do you say it that way" or "what does it mean?"

For mine, no, it's not wrong.<br>  <br>  Many monotheistic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) do teach that doing spells is wrong, and if you subscribe to one of those faiths you *might* find that doing spells conflicts with your set of morals if those morals are completely or mostly based in one of those faiths.<br>  <br>  Many other faiths (Wicca, Paganism) do not teach that doing spells is wrong. In fact, they tend to look kindly upon doing white magic (though in this case it would probably be magick) since you are doing something that is intended to be good. If you subscribe to one of those faiths, then you probably will not find that doing spells conflicts with your set of morals if those morals are completely or mostly based in one of those faiths.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't subscribe to any faith, for I am a secular humanist.

Secondly fro any one who does not know a pentgarms you know the cricle with a star in it is not evil in itself it is depedning on how it is used the sign itself is just a sign for magic it the point is up it is good magic if the point is down evil magic. Any hwo doing a spell is not bad unless you are summoning up hate and stuff doinag spell for live help in life or moeny or something si god but remeber doinag spell is only helpful if you go out and and do things for it like lets just say you are trying to find a job but you are having alot of trouble if you do aspel to try and get you a job it won't work unless you go out and look for a job. Then you may get an interview.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	There are no such thing as "spells" or "white magic".|`|6WxsrIusaa	If you have to ask this question then you are probably not ready to DO any spells yourself.<br>  <br>  A spell is just a way of organizing and working with energy.  It's like a recipe:  if magick is food, then the spell is the recipe that helps you put the magick together in such a way as to get the end result that you want.  You can make delicious, nutritious dishes that are good for you and others.  You can make poison that hurts yourself, and others.  Totally up to you.<br>  <br>  Prayer, in other religions, can be used much the same way.  If you pray, "Please God, let so-and-so be hit by a truck today, I hate his rotten stinky guts so much," that's evil.  If you pray, "Please God, please bless so-and-so and keep him safe," that's good.  There's no trick to either prayer or magick; it's all in how you use it.<br>  <br>  When you really understand what magick is and where it comes from, you automatically know that its "goodness" or "badness" is related to what you do with it, the spirit in which you utilize it.  If you need other people to tell you that, then you're just not ready.|`|MLVLMJrCaa	Preforming a spell isnt bad but Im currious about your book or methode, could you please tell me more|`|dFBccLExaa	No, spells are not bad. They're not from the devil, and they aren't going to ruin your life or send you to hell. <br>  They just happen to be misunderstood.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I do not label magic with colors.  Magic is energy, and energy has no color (or intention) of its own.<br>  <br>  Christian concepts like to label "white" as good and "black" as bad.  "Black" does not automatically equate to "evil" or bad.  As we should all know, the world isn't simply all "black and white".  And sometimes darkness is necessary.  Balance in all things.<br>  <br>  That being said - it all depends on what type of spell you are looking to do, what your intentions are, be they ethical or unethical.  And of course, it depends on what your religious beliefs are.  If you are Christian, for example, then your religion has very specific limits on what type of magic you are able to work with, and all other magic would be considered off-limits or wrong.

AA10982716	There are three different ways "bienvenu(e)" works in French (four in Quebec, where it's often used after a thank you as in English):<br>  <br>  The one that never changes is because it's a feminine noun. It's like saying "this is a welcome to you", you're referring to the welcome itself and not saying that the person is welcome.<br>  <br>  The two that do change (bienvenu for a boy, bienvenues for two women, etc) are an adjective and a noun. The adjective is usually not used for people, but for something like a break or food, for example. The noun is used with la/le/les and means "someone (or I guess something) that is welcome.<br>  <br>  So you usually say "Bienvenue chez moi" which as you say is unchangeable, or else "Vous êtes les bienvenus" which is not. But you're right, the first one is more common.|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	I was going to say the same as Darius.<br>  Therefore, he is right ;)|`|81bda06b67f3aa041e733ff5f2351395aa	Because Bienvenue! is the noun, short for nous vous souhaitons la bienvenue.<br>  Bienvenu, -us, -ues would be the past participle. <br>  However you could say : Soyez le bienvenu, les bienvenus...

5qFmukWwaa	I just read that while some of us seem to multi-task that its really impossible. Its just that some people are better at going back and forth between multiple things more quickly. I think it may be a developed skill more than a gender related ability.  If you have a job that requires a variety of skills and you have to complete tasks in a rapidly changing order then you develop skills that appear to be multi tasking.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I find I can't truly multi-task.

KDNWFuZWaa	If you do not want an answer do not ask a question, as to the point of lies, when it comes to religion, everyone believes their own God and no other so therefore every religion is telling lies in the eyes of non-believers.<br>  Just out of curiosity if ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law, how does it stand with religion?|`|bloGqdBqaa	we all know, that's why we are living here and not there....<br>  <br>  now, why they live here is another question!|`|AA10192697	quickly scanning through it I don't see any question.

wCOZsbnBaa	The answer depends on whether or not you think logic precedes God. I am not a theist, and therefore believe it does (purely in a conceptual way).<br>  <br>  God not having free will does not negate his omnipotence.<br>  Omnipotence should be understood as the ability to do that which is logically possible. In this sense, if you believe logic can be applied to God in such a way, then he does not have free will. This would apply to all beings, noone has free will, we are preconditioned by our very nature.  It would be illogical to say that God could act in any way which entails a transgression of his own nature. This is because there is nothing that can impose upon his nature, as he is transcendent. E.g if it is in God's nature to heal person X, he will do so. If he does not heal person X that is because it was not in God's nature to bring about the healing at that particular time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also I would say you are using the terms 'good' and 'evil' as if they precede God. In reading religious texts, you will see that the God of classical theism, is not one whom acts in a way that is in accordance with man's notion of that which is good or evil but rather, that which God commands, is good, purely as it is in Gods "will". God permits suffering for example, but the theist would not say this action is intrinsically evil. <br>  <br>  What is interesting is how we perceive this God and his supposed interaction with the universe. Because of Gods nature, it is hard to logically justify, a linear perception of God and his "thought" and "action". Such thoughts are typified by the idea that perhaps... at point 1 God decides Y. This is problematic because God is believed to exist beyond the conditions of time. But I see where you are going with your question, I hope I helped somewhat.|`|iOPgJ1fNaa	absolutely no sense at all.<br>  <br>  Because he created heaven<br>  and then<br>  he created a evil being who is out of his control (satan)<br>  The same evil being has created hell by will of allah, god, yewah etc..<br>  So dont believe the crap about love, good, mercy cos there is the other side to the coin too Viz hate, hell fire, boiling oil spilling guts etc.|`|hFGT2RCkaa	It makes absolutely no sense. God has given us free will so that we can decide what we will and won't do. He wants us to choose to love him, because you can never truly know if someone loves you if you make them. With options at hand and your own free will God wants us to choose him on our own. I could never truly choose to love someone that forces me to love them. That's not love. God's will is that we would all be willing to love him, not force us to do what he wants in order to meet some "greater cause". I have choosen to love God.|`|gM454VF8aa	He does have free will, and He is Love, that's why he chooses to help you sometimes, and doesn't do some other times.

MbaP0u6iaa	Nobody can possibly know if he did or not. But if he did tell her before their marriage that he didn't really love her and was actually in love with someone else, then that was honest at least. If he did tell her, and she went ahead and married him anyway because she wanted to be a princess - and it's clear that she did; she worked hard at pretending to be an outdoor type and to share his interests, to make him want to marry her -  then she should have stuck to her side of the bargain.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Supposedly on the night before their wedding.<br>  <br>  I think what he said was something along the lines of how she was an acceptable bride according to the establishment, but that he would never love her as he loved Camilla, and that his affair with Camilla had never really ended, nor did he intend for it to.|`|g4lLX3iaaa	I don't know that he told her that before they married but it was certainly implied when in an interview he said something along the lines of,he loved her,whatever that means.All Diana really was,was a womb with a view......of children but nothing much else.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	It has been reported that he told her that,but,not on her wedding night;it was more near the last breakup,after Harry was born and Diana and Charles were having a row about Camilla.But Charles has also said the friends and family about Diana,after looking at a picture of the two together in early-wedded bliss,"But we did love each other..."|`|9fmTHUMkaa	I don't think so.Why would he?He is not mad.If he is marrying a woman it's because he loves her.If he would have loved cammilla at that time he would have married her instead.

(Mt 7:6) That is why Jesus on certain occasions refrained from giving full information or direct answers to certain questions when doing so could have brought unnecessary harm. (Mt 15:1-6; 21:23-27; Joh 7:3-10) Evidently the course of Abraham, Isaac, Rahab, and Elisha in misdirecting or in withholding full facts from nonworshipers of Jehovah must be viewed in the same light.Ge 12:10-19; chap 20; 26:1-10; Jos 2:1-6; Jas 2:25; 2Ki 6:11-23.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!!

xqYrGjGVaa	1. Nausea or morning sickness: Morning sickness is term to describe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. This occurs in approximately 50% to 95% of all pregnant women as early as the first week of pregnancy. Morning sickness probably got it's name due to the fact that most of the nauseating symptoms start in the morning right after you get out of bed when your blood sugar levels are low. However, it may happen at any time of the day.<br>  <br>  2. Headaches:  If you have never experienced regular headaches before pregnancy, be prepared for some throbbing pain in your head and neck during pregnancy. Changes in your body's hormonal patterns is the primary cause of headaches during pregnancy. Other conditions like lack of sleep, poor posture, stress, dehydration and low blood sugar levels may also worsen of cause headaches.<br>  <br>  3. Dizziness and fainting spells: Due to the lowered blood pressure in your body during pregnancy, blood flow to the brain may cause dizziness and fainting spells in serious cases.<br>  <br>  4. Mood swings: With your hormones raging, it is common for women to feel moody during their pregnancy. All women have to go through a period of adjustment to settle into their new roles as a pregnant women and that takes time.<br>  <br>  5. Fatigue: If you feel tired and experience some or all of the symptoms mentioned in this article, you have a good chance of being pregnant. Hormonal changes are usually the main cause of fatigue followed by the additional weight you have to carry around. <br>  <br>  6. Food cravings: Craving for food that you normally would not eat could be a sign that you are pregnant. Normally, women report cravings for salty and sweet food during pregnancy while others report a uncommon desire for spicy or starchy food.<br>  <br>  7. Weight gain and bloating: The combination of your baby's growth and your increased food intake will cause you to put on weight and your clothes to fit tighter than usual. An inexplicable increase in size of your stomach is also a definitive sign that you may be pregnant.<br>  <br>  8. Heartburn: Hormones created during pregnancy may relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which opens the valve to allow stomach acids to flow up into the esophagus causing a burning sensation.<br>  <br>  9. Lower back pain: As your baby grows in size, the additional weight pulls your spine to the front of your body and causes you to experience some back pain from time to time.<br>  <br>  10. Constipation: Hormonal changes during pregnancy slows down the movement of food through your digestive system which results in constipation. This could be a sign of pregnancy if you do not experience constipation frequently. <br>  <br>  11. Constant urination: Your growing baby in the uterus puts a lot of pressure on your bladder and you may find yourself visiting the toilet more frequently than usual.<br>  <br>  12. High Basal Body Temperature (BBT): If your BTT stays in the high temperature range for 18 days or more, you have a good chance of being pregnant.<br>  <br>  13. Cramping: As the uterus grows and stretches, it is normal to feel cramps that feel similar to menstrual cramps.<br>  <br>  14. Spotting: Slight bleeding occurs when the fertilized egg begins to implant itself into the uterus any time from 3 to 6 days after fertilization. This usually happens outside of a normal menstruation cycle so it should not be confused with a normal period.<br>  <br>  15. Darkening of the areolas: Your areolas could darken and increase in diameter during pregnancy. This is caused by your body's preparation for your breasts to produce milk.<br>  <br>  16. Tender or swollen breasts: A lot of women experience sore, swollen, tingly or tender breasts during pregnancy due to the increasing hormones that are used to prepare a woman for breastfeeding. This feels like a amplified version of how your breast feels before your period.<br>  <br>  17. Missed periods:  If you have been sexually active and you missed a period, it is a good indication that are you are pregnant. A pregnancy test should be taken to confirm if the missed period is really caused by your pregnancy.<br>  <br>  18. Positive pregnancy tests: Only a positive urine test or blood test can give you solid indication that you are pregnant. The problem is, they may not be fool proof. Remember to visit a doctor to conduct further tests to confirm the results.<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that not all of the symptoms above can confirm a pregnancy. When you have a positive pregnancy test, visit a doctor to get more tests done to confirm your pregnancy. That's the only way to find out if you are truly pregnant.|`|8lOjRnEJaa	Take a home pregnancy test. Once it's positive make an appt with your obgyn.

H8gsDRWeaa	Laird is a land-owner in Scotland.<br>  English law and Scottish law sometimes do not agree. While English law is based primarily on common law, Scottish law is based on the civil code.  There may be fine points of contention once you're north of the Tweed.  Since one doesn't really want to make the expensive acquaintance of such fine ladies/gentlemen as a Writer to the Signet or a Sheriff-Depute, it's probably best not to meddle with one's cards of Identity.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	It's not a real title of nobility.Laird is not a peerage title like Lord is.A laird is not up for a seat in the House of Lords in Parliament.A laird is an hereditary Scottish landowner, and carries certain local or feudal rights.And it is possible to buy land to get this non-title title,which means that a person owns land in Scotland.So,you,too,can buy land and become a laird--just the name for any Scottish land owner.|`|oBjQXtxCaa	You can use any name title you chose (but this is the point) providing it is not meant to deceive or be used as fraud. Therefor you can call yourself Sir Fred but you cannot call yourself Sir Fred, Kngt (Knight)|`|MbaP0u6iaa	Your first reaction was correct: this is a silly scam. <br>  <br>  The title "Laird" has no legal force, in Scotland or anywhere else, but it was customarily given to the owner of the biggest house in the locality and/or a serious estate. It's a bit like "Lord of a Manor" in England, except that manorial lordships have genuine legal existence, whereas "Laird of X" just means vaguely "the most important landowner in X". Thus, logically, there can only be one "Laird of X" - these schemes whereby thousands of people buy a square foot of land in Glen Whatever and all wander around calling themselves "Laird of Glen Whatever" are nonsensical.<br>  <br>  Suppose your friend John Smith had bought Glenbrae House, the biggest house in the little village of Glenbrae, with land attached; then he would have a reasonable right to consider himself as Laird of Glenbrae. It would be better if the owners of Glenbrae House had traditionally always been called "Laird of Glenbrae", and more seemly if he waited for local people to start calling him that rather than just assuming the description; but even if not, it still wouldn't be entirely unreasonable. Note, however, that his rank would still be that of a plain "Mister". If any old-fashioned Scottish persons chose to acknowledge his landowning status, they could refer to and address him as "Glenbrae" (never, ever "Laird Glenbrae" or "Laird John Smith of Glenbrae" which would always be wrong even for a genuine laird) and his wife as "Lady Glenbrae". But, equally, it would still be perfectly accurate to call them "Mr and Mrs John Smith". <br>  <br>  The reason your friend can add this nonsensical title to official documents is that British law allows people to adopt and use whatever name they like, provided they do not do it for an illegal purpose (e.g. to evade the law, or steal someone else's identity) and the name itself is not illegal (e.g. blasphemous or obscene). If you are a British subject and wanted to change your name to "Whattoottattoo the First, King of the Drowned Land of Lyonesse", you could legally do so. Of course, you would have to expect to get sniggered at for calling yourself by a silly title, just as your friend will have to.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	Laird = Landowner, it is perfectly legal

One way to help this maybe to explain that nobody will think lesser of her based on just looking at them its silly! It seems she really cares what other people think about her over her own opinion which needs to change.<br>  <br>  the cutting and burning is really scary and i advise you to look for help RIGHT AWAY.. whether it be parents, therapist, doctors, anybody!! Trust me if i were you i wouldn't care about her getting mad at you for telling people to help her b/c you maybe saving her life!|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Yep I had a friend like that. I told her exactly what was bothering me about her - and when she did not stop...I stopped being her friend until she decided to grow up.

The only way of knowing if he is gay is just ASK him. It's probably better to just get it out in the open and know if he's gay then to waste your time swooning over him if he's not actually gay. He may just think you're a really great guy, but want to only be with women. It also may be a lot harder for you to to talk about it because you are in high school, but there are so many more kids opening up about their sexuality in high school now. <br>  <br>  You may want to check out and see if your school has a support group for the LGBT community.

An adult studying twice a week for an hour in a non-English speaking country will see to have a very difficult time.|`|jhdpLhNcaa	As a foreigner I say not that much.

In theory, that should make it easier to learn, but it's actually very confusing.<br>  Also, many learn new english words from songs and movies, but they often use bad grammar to make the lyrics rhyme, for example : you was lovin' me, now you hatin' me..blah blah.|`|OaDXVJU1aa	dat ting aint sick u no.... badass blood tis safer whateva...tsk<br>  <br>  Yes, I whole heartedly agree with you.

How much is your attraction to women related to your love for God? If you related the two ideas at all you would be repulsed by her for keeping you two from making love for so long.    Why don't YOU rid yourself of all earthly things and wait until heaven for pleasure? Have you no ability to put your expectations of others into perspective.

What a naughty little scamp you are.|`|R8yelFG7aa	If you believe that homosexuality is a sin, that's like asking "Why do some people choose to lie rather than go to heaven."  If someone has salvation, they have it even if they continue to "sin".  Why do straight people choose to have sex in general rather than go to heaven?      Why do modern women choose to go to church with their heads uncovered, or speak in church, rather than go to heaven?  Why do modern men choose to cut their hair rather than go to heaven?  A lot of what used to be considered sin is now just completely irrelevant.|`|1dx0Z26zaa	Because it doesn't say gays won't go to heaven. It's a translation thing that is taken out of context. Like for instance, when it says man should not lie with another man, it's talking to a group of people that were sleeping with everyone for their sex god. So even though they were sleeping with another man, it was not because they were gay, but because they were doing it for an idol and also man was not created to sleep around. They were not actually gay. Like I said, translation thing. And for every verse that talks about it bad to be gay, there's a counter argument.    I really don't feel like going into this because I deal with it so much, but if you want more examples, I have plenty.|`|rhzyzEteaa	why do u believe in god over satan?    im not christian or santanist, im wiccan  but still, even i know that if u think we are all gods children, then y wouldnt he let "gays" into heaven?|`|2beAXP8aaa	It is 2009!

DYnvacFVaa	He was completing the prophecy, when he said that it was completed.    1) Matthew 27:46 tells us that about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Here, Jesus was expressing His feelings of abandonment as God placed the sins of the world on Him  and because of that, God had to turn away from Jesus. As Jesus was feeling that weight of sin, He was experiencing a separation from God for the only time in all of eternity. This was also a fulfillment of the prophetic statement in Psalm 22:1.|`|fc4U6217aa	Jesus felt emotionaly forsaken. Because at that moment in time he was taking on the world and whiping the world clean of humans sins if they ask for it.|`|WxNvO4t5aa	Before his brutal torture and crucifixion, Jesus prayed in the garden that if there was another way to redeem man, other than his vicious death, that God take this cup from him, but if it was His will for Christ to be ravaged and crucified, then let it be done.  Christ saying, "Why have you forsaken me?", in my interpretation, means that he was only asking God why he has given him up to beaten and killed by man, why wasn't there another way.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	the man was in pain... he has just been whipped, tortured and nailed by his hands and both feet to a dirty wooden cross... he did nothing to deserve this.... and I dont believe he knew it was going to happen.. thats movies.

If Jesus is God and knows what God is all about and what's going on, why would He have to ask "Why?" and why would he feel forsaken if he knew what was going on?|`|8rbQBaIeaa	All during His ministry Jesus had known what it meant to be forsaken. Early, the members of His own family forsook Him. Nazareth, His home town, had forsaken Him. The nation He came to save forsook Him. But in every such instance He could always steal away to the tender healing fellowship of His Heavenly Father.  Jesus was bearing the wages of your sins and of my sins, and therefore He had to be actually forsaken of God so that we need not be forsaken of God forever in the eternal regions of the lost.     To save us, Jesus had to know what it was like to be like us. He, like us, had to be fosaken by God so that he could sacrifice himself for us.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	he was reciting from psalm 22 a prophecy of his death

Lets just say you're not the only ones with faux religious crackpots in charge.|`|AA10824205	To tell you the truth,    Many Muslims also don't like the implementation of the Shariah, followed by the so many propagandas against shariah, and they don't know that shariah can solve their lots of problems.    Secondly, when the Muslims themselves are corrupt at the lower levels , how can they have the courage to ask the leaders?    When i am a businessman, and i do fraud with others, how could i ask the leaders to work according to islam?    Fourthly, atleast some islamic principles are implemented almost everywhere, or atleast the Muslims are allowed almost to work according to islam in their private lives, like Praying , Fasting, Masajids, which it is difficult to them in other countries, like when masajids are attacked in india, it is atleast better not to be attacked and pray calmly, than to be attacked by the others while praying, and masajids burnt, and murders in the name of religion etc.    So they are in the midst, they have to compromise, which make them accept those leaders sometimes, but many Muslims do talk against them, in many countries, e.g in our country Pakistan, we do fight for the complete restoration of shariah, as well as against the lawlessness and corruption.

Mine wasn't able to so two of my very close friends threw me one. I agree with the person that said the family should not do it. It's considered somewhat tacky. The bride's family has so many other obligations, the bridal shower should just be a fun thing where the bride can relax and enjoy.|`|REC4YgOuaa	the maid of honor, or the best friend|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If she's already been the bride, i.e., has already gotten married, then it's too late.  If she's still the fiancee, then it should be her maid of honor (with help from the bride maids) as long as the MOH is not her mom or sister (which would appear that the family is begging for gifts).  It should be a non-related close friend (which usually is your MOH).  However, these days I've seen sisters throw the bridal shower, her mother throw the party.
2SSD6BP9aa	Nothing in what you said here makes me think he's gay.    Hopefully he'll be ok with the fact that you are gay.  The fact that he gets angry when you talk about being gay makes me think he may not handle it well.  But even if he gets mad at first, he still might come around once he gets used to it.    If not, it's his loss.    Good luck!|`|k3TKEOJBaa	Hello Love from being in your shoes he is ashamed of what he is and he can't deny what he feels and that makes him mad especially since he doesnt like it when you talk about things to do with being gay.

W0rcm3awaa	To be honest thats ridiculous. Just take your hat off and wait until you're in the real world. Don't start a religion for such a stupid reason, a religion is actually meant to be important not a joke like this, even though some end up being it.     how you start a religion is by creating a basic of core concepts (real ones not just 'we always wear hats') and get people to follow it. For a long time it will be a cult (yes all religions start out as cults even chrsitianity and judaism) and once it has enough people its a religion.

MPX0f5jzaa	We can define G-d and we have several "utterable" names for him.  Jews don't rely on faith, we're about facts and the Torah is our documentable history.  I don't see the use of a name the make or break of believing in G-d.    Look at the Sh'ma itself:  Sh'ma Adonai, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Ehad.  Just as translated below, Adonai is a name of God.  We also frequestly use Elohim, Hashem, El Shaddai, and Tzva'ot, another interpretation of Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh (also mispronounced as Yahweh, Jehovah, and others).    We don't pronounce the names and sometimes use the spelling of G-d to notate our reverence.    Like the others said, it's not for casual use such as it says in the text to not use His name in vain.  That goes for dumb phrases such as "OMG" or "G-d damn it!", etc.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: what it says is fairly simple:  for the ancient Hebrews (later known as Jews) The Lord is our G-d, the Lord is One and there is to be no other G-d for them.    G-d's name isn't used out of respect. It is considered sacred and should not be used casually, if ever.  Think of it this way: you wouldn't walk up to the Queen of England and say, "Yo, Bethy, how's it going?"    Exodus gives all kinds of additional information, Exodus and Deut. told the Jews how to live their lives and how to worship G-d.|`|AA11992885	ok, word for word, your sentence makes no sense    the Torah narrates the story of why the Land belongs to Israel  but what do you mean "at the name of Israel's God"????    the Sh'ma says simply    Hear or Know......Hear of Israel, HaShem is OUR God, HaShem is ONE  it means, simply, that OUR God, is OUR God, HE came to US, WE accepted HIM, no one else did, HE is OUR God, HE resides over US......and HE is ONE, HE is not a unit, HE is not a group, HE is not comprised of parts, HE is ONE, a complete whole undivideable, and a single entity, comprised ONLY of ONE.    i have no idea what you mean by your second question, "a creedy we can not define"???????  i think i just, very easily defined it    concerning HIS name, i was in my teens before i knew my father's first name, and i would be better off not knowing it, so, did i not have a father for the first 12 years of my life simply because i didn't know my father's first name?????  heavens no, i had a father, i didn't need his name to know he was there, especially when i screwed up and i felt his belt across my butt.........trust me, not knowing his name didn't take that pain away|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I am not entirely sure what you are trying to ask.  You seem to be coming from a Christian perspective - forgive me if I've got that wrong, but reference to creed is just not something that is meaningful in Judaism.  Ours is a covenant-based religion, not a faith- or creed-based one.  It is true that the Sh'ma is the closest thing we have to a 'creed' - it is a basic statement of our understanding that G-d is one and indivisible.  In Judaism, unlike in Christianity but similarly to Islam, we absolutely refute any notion of G-d as corporeal.  The concept of G-d as something entirely abstract, a concept rather than a tangible entity, is core to Judaism and differentiated the early religion very powerfully from all the surrounding groups' religions.      We have many names to refer to this mysterious concept - Adonai, HaShem, El Shaddai, etc - and the unpronounceable holy name of YHVH (Hebrew yod hey vav hey).    Torah relates the story not of G-d, but of G-d's relationship with what became the Jewish people.    Exodus 34:5-7 reads "And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed: 'The LORD, the LORD, God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and unto the fourth generation.' "  I'm not sure what sort of information or insight you are expecting to find there - nor for what!    If it worries you that Judaism is unconcerned with having a 'creed' or a closely-defined 'named' deity, then clearly it's not the religion for you.  It IS a very different sort of religion from Christianity and to try to understand it in Christian terms is doomed to failure.

None of the major religions believe that God just appeared out of nothing, what they believe is that God always existed.<br>   <br>  Only things that had beginning need a cause. Life and the universe had a beginning. Therefore life and the universe had a cause. <br>   <br>  But if God always existed then he never had a beginning and therefore he does not need to have been made by something or someone.<br>   <br>  For many years, evolutionists and most scientists believed that the Universe was eternal, always existed and never had a beginning, so the concept of at least the possibility of something being eternal is well established.<br>   <br>  However, having discovered that the Universe had a beginning, science now has to face the next logical question: <br>   <br>  "What caused the beginning of the Universe?" <br>   <br>  That "What caused the beginning of the Universe?" question makes rationally thinking evolutionists very uncomfortable and they tend to pass the buck and avoid having to give an answer to that one by saying that Evolution is only concerned with what happen AFTER the Universe began not how or why it began.<br>  <br>  Atheists are in a real dilemma: either accept a transcendent cause for the universe (God) or believe that something can come from nothing. <br>   <br>  While both ideas are so mind-blowing they are hard for us to get our heads around, a pre-existent God is the most rational explanation because to believe that matter and energy came from nothing out of nowhere all by itself defies a commonsense principle: “Out of nothing, nothing comes.” Some-thing simply can’t come from no-thing. <br>   <br>  Either it was always there or something (or someone) that WAS always there made it happen. <br>   <br>  Atheist professor Kai Nielsen admitted, “Suppose you hear a loud bang…and you ask me, ‘What made that bang?’ and I reply, ‘Nothing, it just happened.’ You would not accept that.” <br>   <br>  If that is true of a little bang, then why not a big bang too?<br>   <br>  He makes a good point!<br>   <br>  Moreover, if God is...well...God, then He is a supernatural force. And the very definition of "supernatural" means that He stands OUTSIDE of nature and is not restricted by the laws of nature.<br>   <br>  If God is God, then he needs no Creator, he IS the creator and He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so he has no beginning in time.<br>   <br>  Therefore God did not come from anywhere. No one made the Creator of the universe. He had no beginning, and will have no ending. He is the eternal, self-existing Being that we used to think the universe was but we now know has to be the someone or something that was here before the universe and therefore transcends time and space.|`|MEny7pBHaa	i am amazed so many people ask this. He who creates all things cannot have a creator... does that make sense? if ALL things exist by God's hand, then what hand formed the Creator? no hand at all.

ctOge9SLaa	This is a very genuine kind of question and I want to thank you for putting it up.<br>  When I think of hearing the voice of God, I think of a radio being able to pick up the invisible waves in the air through the antennae.  God is Spirit, and the part of man, that is able to receive and know what God is saying is his regenerated spirit within him.<br>  <br>  God made man with this specific part so that He can have fellowship with him.<br>  Zech 12:1 speaks of God creating 3 wonderful things. He created the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man within him. <br>  We know that because of the fall, man's spirit, soul and body became damaged. His spirit in particular, became deadened, his soul, with the mind, will and emotions also got affected and his body became the " flesh" full of all kinds of lusts.<br>  <br>  But God, who has always wanted men to know Him in an intimate way, took steps through the full redemptive work of His Son Jesus Christ in order to restore man's entire tripartite being.<br>  By believing and receiving this One, man's spirit became enlivened, and filled with the very life and nature of God Himself. We were filled with the Spirit of the Living God and this broken antennae was fixed.<br>  <br>  As we are those spending time contacting the Lord in the Word and in prayer and fellowship, we are learning the speaking of the Lord. Our spirit has the capacity and ability to sense and know things related to God, His Will and His purpose. Our spirit is also able to substantiate all the truths in the Word of God.  The Word of God is his breathing out to us.. His Breath. Breath in the Greek means Pneuma or Spirit.  So only man's regenerated spirit can " pick up" on the things related to God, who is Spirit.<br>  <br>  So Praise the Lord, may we be those taking the time with the Lord. The more you spend time with a Person, the  more you learn that Person, understand this One and come to love that Person more and more. You are sensitive to their Feelings and their Leading.  I just praise the Lord today, we can have the Word in our hands and the Spirit within our spirits. We are full furnished and equipped to not only hear God's speaking,but also walk by the Spirit and in doing so, we satisfy God's heart.<br>  <br>  Grace be with all the diligent seekers of the Lord.<br>  Thank you for this wonderful question,<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	Don't fall into the trap a lot of Christians fall into, of running around trying to hear God, almost like some kind of psychic divination.<br>  <br>  The way it works is this: Answers to 99.9% of your life questions are in the Bible.

pm2EeEgiaa	Teenagers usually have identity crisis: because they are starting to form a whole new life and personality independent from their family.<br>  <br>  You will know if you have identity crisis because there are times you will have emotional spells, self-depreciating thoughts, the feeling of superiority, the feeling of invincibility, wanting to be independent, wanting to be loved, desperation to be accepted - all that - and yes, they run on cycles. These are normal - as long as they don't completely ruin your life.|`|LRbxal5Faa	For me, an identity crisis is when one doubts the integrity of who and/or what they think they are. Most of us go through several in a life time. Generally when their lives are undergoing great change, such as adolescence, entrance into the work-a-day world, and the empty nest syndrome.<br>  <br>  When I know I am passing through an identity crisis, I don't typically talk about it. It's about as personal as it gets. How long does it last? That is about as variable as it gets, with no clear beginnings and no clear ends.
RizVdOcCaa	Genetics play a huge role in disposition and temperament. When one considers nature vs. nurture issues, he/she normally winds up somewhere in the middle ground. Societal influences when combined with genetic predispositions will yield a unique individual-- as we are all supposed to be-- that is a product of everything society and biology has to offer. <br>  <br>  A child with psychosis born to loving parents will always be psychotic. The same could be said of a loving child born to psychotic parents. However, A psychotic child may be altered in a positive way by society, hence nullifying (or dulling) his/her unfortunate behavior. The converse is also true. <br>  <br>  There is no real answer to this question if you are answering honestly without a nature/nurture bias. What can be said is that all extenuating circumstances must be taken into account because the disposition of an individual is affected by everything he/she comes into contact with.|`|cr7DZb7Caa	A person is not good or evil, only their actions.  With children, I think it's what they learn from others.  Sometimes the parents don't teach them right from wrong, but even in a bad family, they can learn from other positive sources such as teachers.  They can also fall in with the wrong crowd at a young age no matter how well their parents try to raise them. There are no such things as evil genes, and trying to blame the ills of the world on a political party or a religion other than yours is just plain ignorant and ridiculous.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Genes and environment.

Such thinking is medieval and went out a long, long time ago when they stopped torturing the mentally ill because they were believed to be possessed by demons.|`|mQZDizMVaa	Very Good Question and a good challenge to answer.<br>  <br>  I think the truth comes out when children reach adult level; then some (awful, etc.) figure they "can act anyway they like because they're no longer living at home." They're also Opportunists-adapting to and creating negative environments, i.e. cliques, especially in the workplace so they can get over.<br>  <br>  Then there are those whose parents are jerks-but somehow their children developed and maintained their sense of compassion and diplomacy, perhaps through environmental and social experiences. Perhaps, i.e., they went to a sleep-away camp, where teamwork, discipline and cooperation were the means to an end and they've taken those skills and tools with them throughout their lives.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	A baby that suffers a break with it's care giver in the first 3 years of life may end up not being able to bond.  This can be due to illness  of the parent or death or what ever. Also children that have been severely abused have this syndrome too. They call them onions because there is no center or core. If you can not feel empathy for another person you don't care about their pain then you can hurt them without remorse. It is almost impossible to rehabilitate them.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I believe there is also a third factor and that it is called Choice. Some people have terrible parents and a chaotic upbringing and survive and turn out good in spite of it all. Others may be brought up right and have good parents and their kids get into trouble and start in downward spiral. How else you can explain large families where there is one bad one and the rest turn out wonderful or one good and the rest bad?  And how can you explain someone who has done terrible things and then gives his heart to God and starts anew? That is Choice.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Well, nature or nurture is always a difficult one, in all circumstances. When you are talking about normal people, and why they turn out the way they do....its usually a mixture of the two.<br>  <br>  However, when you are talking about people who become really bad - murderers, rapists...I really and honestly believe that there is some sort of "bad seed" situation, where this person is just created bad and nobody can do anything about it. You hear about people who, when they were little kids, used to torture helpless animals....and they grow up to be murderers. They must be born bad.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, having re-read your Q, you seem to be talking about "nice versus nasty" rather than murderers and rapists. But I still think there is a lot of "nature" in everyone's makeup....when, as you say, nice parents can end up with horrible kids, and nasty parents with lovely ones. <br>  <br>  Lets just say, I think "its all in the genes".<br>  <br>  NB.... My husband has 3 sons from his first marriage. All three were born within 3 years. All had exactly the same upbringing, good schools, good morals, all the good influences. Two boys are now great citizens , well educated, good jobs and great family men. The other one is a drug addict, always in trouble, does every wrong thing you can think of. And he was adopted at birth . His birth mother was a drug user , mentally unstable, did jail time. Like I said, its all in the genes.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	both society plays a roll in the attitude or outlook people get. schools, parents, friends, tv shows, music and film all tell or teach growing kids things about life and how they should behave. for instance if schools teach there is no god and there are no consequences for your action then kids are no longer as hesitant or remorseful and stealing or taking life. hence the mob mentality of greed over taking large companies. when profit is the only reason for your decisions. the company damages the environment, destroys peoples lives, and can crash the financial markets if the company is connected with hundreds of other companies. so the market meltdown is a result of the let's eliminate god / prayer or worship in the democrat controlled public schools and lets convince all of americas kids the darwin's "we evolved from apes" theory is how man got here. if you don't believe democrats control the school system ask the teachers association which party they have voted for in every election.

But the majority of illegal immigrants in the US are brown, so it must be racism. No matter how you explain it, they can't see that illegal immigrant is not a race. And it still wouldn't be a race even if ALL illegal immigrants were from the same race.<br>  <br>  I guess illegal immigration won't be an issue for many non whites until we start getting invaded by white 'immigrants'. I'm sure it will be a problem then. But it won't be racism, no sir. It will be concern for our country and it's resources. Yeah, right. Let's see if they are offered amnesty.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	I'd call it social elitism.  Disliking any general population seems to be a bad way to handle things.

PjwWWMu4aa	I don't think it would work anyway, so from that perspective I have to say its ethics are entirely neutral.<br>  <br>  On the off chance that it were to work, I'd say its highly unethical because its directly messing around with the thoughts and feelings of another, which I find reprihensible. Its taking away any free will that person might have had and denying them the right to think, reason, and feel for themselves.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	That depends on the kind of love spell you are referring to.<br>  <br>  Casting a spell to make a particular person fall in love with you, in my opinion, is highly unethical.<br>  <br>  But casting a spell on yourself to clear the path and help bring the love that is right for you into your life, or casting a spell on yourself to open yourself up to giving and receiving love - I have no issue with this.  What this does is help to remove our "self-imposed limitations" or obstacles if you will, and recognize the opportunity for the love that is right for you when it is presented.<br>  <br>  "Green Witch" is just a term that refers to a witch who works herbal magic - usually such witches work their magic outdoors and they grow what they use in their own gardens.|`|Khcu3oVwaa	That depends; if the love spell is to make someone fall in love then yes - it is wrong. If it is to make someone more open to love, its still wrong (unless you have their permission). Everyone has to learn to open themselves to new ideas and emotions. If the spell was to attract your soulmate, or attract love to yourself, then thats ethical enough for me to class it as a 'good' spell.<br>  Though I'm not much of one myself, I think a Green WItch would be more inclined to the second due to the nature (no pun intended) of their materials.<br>  Besides, what ever happened to the Rede?

However if the spell is created by both parties (or they are both involved with the  same intent), if the love spell is for one person to make them more open to loving themselves or enhance an all ready loving relationship I can't see anything wrong with it.<br>  Two good ways to tell what is ethical or not in regards to spells is <br>  1. A spell should never be cast on someone without their permission. Period. No matter what the intent.<br>  <br>  2. Follow the "golden rule" what you put out, you recieve back.

UzSaTblgaa	Remember the purpose of a comma is to show a logical pause that adds to the comprehension of the sentence.  So, if it seems logical and does not interrupt the sentence so that it is harder to understand, use commas.   If you, place commas wherever, you think they look good or, you just insert them too, often, then they make it, harder to read your writing.  See what I mean?|`|9Wt6MjVPaa	I think if you use too many, it is a run-on sentence.<br>  <br>  Ich denke, ob Sie zu viele verwenden, ist es ein angeh?ngter Satz.|`|VUdaZUpwaa	Hi,<br>     The tendency nowadays is to minimize the usage of commas.  Only use a comma if it is required by grammar rules or if it adds to the clarity of the sentence.  If you have a good feeling for what grammar requires for usage of commas, don't add any more unless you can explain why you added them.  The usual pauses and hesitations in searching for the right word that occur in verbal discourse are usually not appropriate for punctuation unless, in some instances,  when you're writing dialog.<br>  <br>  FE|`|KpFLNr9oaa	yes its still incorrect. there are certain places you should put commas and periods.<br>  read this article: if you put more commas than usually you are probably either creating a comma splice error or a run on sentence error.

aj5IBTuXaa	You know, in the generation that followed WW II, it was hard to understand the Holocaust.  I'll admit that I was a skeptic.  As I grew older, I kept an open mind.  But then I met some people and visited a place that made the difference.<br>  <br>  1.  My father-in-law was in the 3rd wave on Omaha Beach on D-Day.  His unit went into Poland and liberated a death camp.  Until the day he died, he would only talk around it because it shocked him that people could do that sort of thing to other people.  But he confirmed that it really happened.<br>  <br>  2.  My neighbor up the street, a delightly 80+ "little old lady,"  talked about her time working in the death camps.  She was liberated.  (Not by my father-in-law - different camp.)  She had the tattooed number on her arm.  She never tried to get it erased because she didn't ever want to forget.<br>  <br>  3.  Anyone who doubts?  Go visit Washington D.C. for the National Holocaust Museum.  Don't eat lunch just before your visit unless you are prepared to blow chow right there in the middle of the tour.<br>  <br>  As we know, too many people just cannot believe in Man's inhumanity to Man.  They refuse to see it.  Not to mention that the Islamists don't want anyone to take a sympathetic position to Israel and Jews anyway.  But there is no doubt that it happened.  Which makes me agree.

But things are about to change if more of them read the English Bible.<br>  <br>  At the moment the penalty for reading the English Bible is shunning and excommunication.

The Amish are very self-sufficient and I think that their customs has allowed them to be so.|`|XoNuUrYoaa	The Amish have bibles in High German, which they do not speak. The Amish regularly read their bibles and some of the strictest Old Order Amish groups will only permit the Bible to be the only book read.<br>  <br>  Their Ordnung (rule book) is actually based on the bible and exists because "the Amish have no central church government, each assembly is autonomous and is its own governing authority. Thus, every local church maintains an individual set of rules, adhering to its own Ordnung, which may vary from district to district as each community administers its own guidelines."<br>  <br>  "...to the Amish, the Ordnung provides a strong sense of group identity; all of its rules are supported by scripture, meaning that any outside persecution is to be considered as the natural result of Christian discipleship....Some of the most common Ordnung rules are: separation from the world, hard work, a woman's submission to her husband, mode of dress, and refusal to buy insurance. Outsiders often think of the Ordnung in terms of restrictions, i.e. no electrical power lines, no telephone in the home, and no personal ownership of automobiles. However, many of the Ordnung guidelines are for the purpose of guarding a person's character. The Ordnung attempts to prevent pride, envy, vanity, laziness, dishonesty, etc...The purpose of the Ordnung is to guide Amish behavior into being more Christ-like..."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnung" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnung</a><br>  <br>  The Beachy Amish have group studies using a Bible in English, generally the KJV.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Come on all the rules in the bible are arbitrary human rules laid down by the leaders at the time it was written.

In that respect I see some parts of the universe as “accident” or “random chance”.  Though a lot of the things we see as random chance today, I suspect are not really that random. It is just we do not understand the “workings” well enough to see the logical patterns ... yet.  However, there are far more things that are just too logical, organized and predictable, to have been the result of some random chaotic creation.<br>  <br>  Though I guess if we assume that the "Osculation Theory” is true, the universe could have been created and destroyed then recreated billions, or even trillions, of times before by sheer chance everything managed to “explode” in just the right way to create life.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe that everything started out that way just about as much as I believe someone can flip a normal coin (one side heads, one side tails, normal balance, etc.) 20 times and have the coin land on heads all twenty times without the person cheating.  <br>  <br>  Though if one tries enough times one should be able to, by pure random chance, get the coin to land 20 times on heads in a row. (odds are 1 in 1,048,576 tries, if i did the math correctly.)  <br>  <br>  So if I am not going to believe that a person can flip a coin 20 times and get it to land on heads each time without "helping" the coin land on heads ... Anyone one want to guess the odds of me believing that a vastly more complex universe was created and all life formed "totally at random" without any "help"?<br>  <br>  As for how I personally look at science and religion:<br>  Religion/The Bible tells us WHAT God did and is doing, while with science we try, with our very limited (yet expanding) knowledge, to figure out HOW Our Creator did everything.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|AA10721549	intelligent design....<br>  <br>  Venus with its Perfect life supportive sulphur acid clouds....<br>  <br>  How could something that useful arise out of complete accident?<br>  <br>  The intelligent designer had to spent eons on creating such a beutiful nightime lighting scenery.|`|gIitANOkaa	Complete accident.<br>  <br>  *<br>  *<br>  Dear Y!A sweeties, <br>  Check out haroldsaenger on Youtube.<br>  Thanks lots of ???|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Beautiful accident and/or unintelligent design.|`|bYU77eteaa	DESIGN|`|756d997cb8cac9f5194b6edf128dc815aa	Incredibly sophisticated design.

It wasn't the source of any movements in the arts or any significant movements at the time.  Christianity wasn't thought as a significant movement until 50 years after Christ.  At that point it was kinda late to do paintings, statues.  As far as devoted prophets you have disciples and books you have the bible.|`|GXvptohoaa	Remember that Jesus didn't start his public life, (meaning performing miracles) until he was 30, and he died at 33.<br>  Jesus was a very humble person, and he didn't need to be performing miracles left and right to prove who he was, and he wouldn't be very humble if he did. Which is why I love him.<br>  He didn't start performing mircales until Mary his Virgin Mother told him to at the wedding of Cana. So he didn't have a very long public life of performing miracles so that could be one of the reasons there wasn't much recorded.<br>  <br>  Second, most people didn't realize who he was. that he was the true Christ at the time. It's like people now a day, hindsight is 20/20. For example, haven't you believed something wasn't true.. and then after something dramatic happened, like a death or something, then you realized that it really was true!<br>  So, people were unsure of Jesus at the time, but then after his death they believed. And that's when the books, paintings, statues started.<br>  <br>  And you have to remember the time in which Jesus lived. It's not like today, where ppl will immediately start making statues, or whatever, to sell because we have technology and the word can reach more people faster than in those times.<br>  <br>  And that's the sad part, Jesus did so much, and loved so much, and no one even cared until he died and gave up his life.<br>  Haven't you ever been ungrateful about someone and didn't care and didn't pay attention, until it was too late? You realize it was too late.<br>  It's the same thing.<br>  <br>  And about the miracles... a miracle could happen to you today, and you'd be like, Wow, i believe in God, thank you God. and he's real. <br>  But then with time, after time has gone by, you start to forget the miracle.. or not really forget the miracle, but not care about it as much because it already happened, so that Joy about the miracle starts to fade and then you're just waiting for the next miracle, and doubting God because your life is so horrible or not going the way you want, or whatever the situation. The people in those times were the same way.<br>  They saw a miracle, rejoiced at how wonderful it was, and how great Jesus was, and then started to doubt again.<br>  And they wanted a miracle again.<br>  <br>  God Bless you! I hope this helps. Have faith.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are so sure that God doesn't exist, than why do you keep asking questions to Christians? You have nothing better to do? I saw that question you asked saying if it's proven God doesn't exist, will you Christians apologize?<br>  <br>  If you have so much faith that God doesn't exist, why have you asked quite literally thousands of questions to Christians in an effort to question their beliefs and to disprove us our faith. If you are so sure that God doesn't exist, why don't you leave us alone with our faith, instead of asking non-geniune questions meant to throw us off our Guard and our God.<br>  If you were secure in the fact that God truly doesn't exist, then you would be secure in leaving us be and wouldn't waste your time. <br>  <br>  What will you do on the day you die, and God is proven to be real? Will you apologize to the Lord? I'm sure, no I'm certain, he'll forgive you.<br>  <br>  God bless you. You need him more than all of us combined.|`|KgCUpE5naa	Chances are they did. However, we know very little about that point in time, even now.

Although no one appears to have written about Jesus during his ministry, that may be because his disciples believed that his Parousia was an imminent event.<br>  <br>  It was only after the passage of many years that they revisited their expectation of his return, and then began to write about him so that succeeding generations of Christians that had not witnesses Jesus directly through their human senses would be able to read what was written by eye-witness believers, or written by their amanuenses.<br>  <br>  The earliest New Testament document is Paul's Epistle to the Saints [church members] at Galatea circa AD50, and the latest written in the NT was the Fourth Gospel, dated at AD104.<br>  <br>  As to the influence of Jesus, it is difficult to underestimate the personal influence of Jesus, and underestimate the influence of his teachings, although you can fall into such errors if you ignore certain indisputable facts.

He grew up in another village. He worked in a carpenter shop until He was thirty. Then for three years He was an itinerant preacher.<br>  <br>  He never owned a home. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never had a family. He never went to college. He never put His foot inside a big city. He never traveled two hundred miles from the place He was born. He never did one of the things that usually accompany greatness. He had no credentials but Himself...<br>  <br>  While still a young man, the tide of popular opinion turned against him. His friends ran away. One of them denied Him. He was turned over to His enemies. He went through the mockery of a trial. He was nailed upon a cross between two thieves. While He was dying His executioners gambled for the only piece of property He had on earth – His coat. When He was dead, He was laid in a borrowed grave through the pity of a friend.<br>  <br>  Nineteen long centuries have come and gone, and today He is a centerpiece of the human race and leader of the column of progress.<br>  <br>  I am far within the mark when I say that all the armies that ever marched, all the navies that were ever built; all the parliaments that ever sat and all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this earth as powerfully as has that one solitary life.<br>  <br>  ----------------------------------<br>  <br>  This is adapted from a sermon by Dr James Allan Francis in “The Real Jesus and Other Sermons” ? 1926 by the Judson Press of Philadelphia (pp 123-124 titled “Arise Sir Knight!”). <br>  <br>  ----------------------------------<br>  <br>  You might like to visit your appraisal of Jesus and see if, when you have completed study of Jesus and his effect upon the world for almost 20 centuries, you can find reasons to amend your primary conclusion.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  QUILL|`|62s7J8sHaa	Josephus, a non-Christian Jewish historian, wrote a comprehensive description of him.

lh8Tn02Naa	The context is the Corinthians' squabbling over minor matters and taking them to the civil courts, rather than settling them amicably among themselves.  Paul uses what seems to me a hyperbole to shake them to their senses - you rely on human authority to judge your piffling affairs, but in the next world angels will be appearing before you for YOU to pass judgement on THEM!<br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  The apocalyptic dualism between ‘church’ and ‘world’ which underlay Paul’s whole discourse in chs. 1–4 [of 1 Corinthians] has its social application in his insistence that the Corinthian Christians are in a wholly different category to outsiders (cf. esp. 2:6–8). The influence of this world-view is further evident in Paul’s appeal to the apocalyptic notion that God’s elect are destined to judge (or rule) the world in the end-time. As in 3:21–3, Paul cleverly portrays the Corinthian Christians as underestimating their own importance. If they remembered their destiny in judging the world, even angels, they would not consider themselves incompetent to judge the trivial matters which they now ask others to decide (vv. 2–4). In reality, the Christian parties to these disputes probably failed to see the church as a juridical entity and looked to Corinthian judges to provide publicly recognized verdicts which would restore their social honour. In Paul’s view, such outside authorities ‘have no standing in the church’ (v. 4; lit. are despised by the church, contrast Rom 13:1–7!).<br>  <br>  Barton, John and John Muddiman, The Oxford Bible Commentary, (London: Oxford University Press) 2001.<br>  <br>  - cut and paste from my CD, not available online.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	Nothing just polishing the proverbial apple .|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	may i have supporting scripture please...|`|eAMq1iBWaa	That God's saints will judge satan and the fallen angels for their rebellion

Different denominations have different policies (that' really the main thing that makes them different). At my church (I'm Methodist) you pretty much get confirmed into the church and baptized at the same time if you're an adult. Kids who grew up in the church go through confirmation classes, get confirmed, then get baptized if they hadn't been already when they were a baby. There's no regulation on how long you have to go to the church to be come an official member.<br>  <br>  But at some churches (Life Church for example) you can basically walk in and ask for baptism, and they baptize you.

So many homosexuals fight tooth and nail trying to get their loved ones and others to believe they were born with these desires.

They often lose relationships with people who were suppose to love them because of it. To begin with, many would give anything to have a choice. Seeing someone who does have a choice and would choose to be with someone of the same sex, is often frustrating. ( further messing up the chance to prove it isn't a choice)<br>  <br>    As a heterosexual, I know I would be more slighted if my spouse left me for another man than for another woman. I can't fight against another man because I don't have the right equipment to satisfy him if that is what he is looking for. (Dating a bisexual is taking the chance they will leave you for a different sex person- which is difficult to accept no matter which way they decide)<br>  <br>   The lucky part is that there is a growing number of bisexuals out there and to be honest, bisexual females are much more accepted by heterosexual males. ( Many have the thought in their minds they might get a trio.)
YupMCYHlaa	In the early days of Christianity there were many different groups of early Christians who believed different things.  Some believed that Christianity was a branch of Judaism and you had to be Jewish to be Christian.  Others believed it was a new religion altogether. Some believed that Jesus was just a man, a very wise teacher. Others believed he was God disguised as a man. Still others believed that Jesus was a man who was 'adopted' by God, or that Jesus was a man but The Christ was an angel who sort of possessed him and allowed him to do miracles--like demonic possession only it was angelic possession.  These views of Christ are called today 'Christologies'.<br>  <br>  The view that won out was that Jesus was both a man and a God.  And part of a Trinity.  This view is somewhat mysterious. You aren't SUPPOSED to understand it completely. But this was the view of the group of Christians founded by Paul, and it was that group that got to pick the books to go into the New Testament so they excluded those books that disagreed with their own view.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note that not one of the books that got into the New Testament was written by anyone who actually knew Jesus, or talked to him.  People who -did- know Jesus, a group led by James, didn't believe he was divine.  They didn't believe he was born of a virgin (he never claimed to be!) or that he was resurrected after death. They believed he was just a 'rabbi', a teacher.<br>  <br>  We are all made in the image of God, so there is a little spark of divinity in all of us.  Sometimes I think we can feel it.  But we all have earthly fathers, and that's fine with me because God never played baseball with me when I was a kid, or took me fishing.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	There are two ways that you can become a child of your parents; by nature and by adoption.  Jesus is the Son of God by nature so He was eternally divine like God His Father.  On the other hand we become a child of God by baptism, which mean we are not immediately divine like Jesus.  However, the purpose of our creation in this world is for us to evolve into divinity by following the life and teachings of Jesus.  We are created human but our destiny is to be divine according to God's plan.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	No. God and Jesus are one, yet seperate, but we are not equal to him nor should we be.

You are the same race of the King, but you are not equal.<br>  <br>  Jesus gave his life(perfect life) for man, this way it was a perfect sacrifice, the first man Adam was perfect and sinned, he chose to do what was bad in Gods eyes. No pressure like the pressure Jesus received and Jesus chose to do what is good in Gods eyes. By doing this he proved Satan a lair, Satan had said that a man would do anything to preserve their own life, even disobey God. Satan called God a liar, Jesus proved Satan was the lair.<br>  <br>  For us imperfect humans to imply that we could be equal to Jesus is ludicrous, we should be humbled to even be considered as brothers of Christ. As the scriptures say, Jesus found delight in the sons of man.<br>  <br>  Jesus was a spirit creature, now he's a divine immortal spirit being for what he did for his heavenly Father Jehovah(Psalms 83:18 King James) & all of mankind.|`|fBxsgS9Taa	If you look in the Old testament in the book of Genesis it talks about the creation of the world.  And when God created the world he saw that it was good.  It says in Genesis 1:27 that we were created in Gods Image.  So we were once divine but their is one thing that separated us from God and that was sin.  But God sent his son Jesus Christ to this earth to die for our sins.  John 3:16 is says that "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that who ever believes in him shall not die but have everlasting life."  He was the son of God, and we are the sons and daughters of God because it says in Genesis that God created us, and he not only created us but he created us in his image. You see by God sending his son to die on the cross for our sins God is giving us the Gift of Eternal life and all we have to do is accept it.  You have to remember that in the Beginning God saw that all was good.  But is was the choice of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden that separated us from God.|`|itroxygvaa	No HE DID NOT SAY "I'm God" and HE DID NOT SAY "I'm son of God"...<br>  Bible has many man-made doctrines and laws.<br>  <br>  Truth is God DID NOT BETAKE A SON, GLORY BE TO HIM!!!!<br>  That's their sayings with their mouths,<br>  they say about God what they do not know!!<br>  <br>  Read these verses from the Noble Quran:<br>  <br>  Baqarah 116-117<br>  <br>  116- AND THEY SAID: “ALLAH HAS TAKEN A SON”, GLORY BE TO HIM, BUT HE HAS ALL THERE IS IN THE HEAVENS AND IN THE EARTH, ALL ARE SUBSERVIENT TO HIM.<br>  <br>  117- THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH, AND IF HE DECREES SOMETHING, HE SAYS TO IT: “BE” AND IT WILL BE.<br>  <br>  “THE CREATOR OF THE HEAVENS AND OF THE EARTH, HOW WOULD HE HAVE A SON, WHEN HE DID NOT HAVE A FEMALE COMPANION, AND HE CREATED EVERY THING, AND HE KNOWS ABOUT EVERY THING”.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

So, yes we are His brothers and sisters, but adopted into His family.<br>  <br>  That does not make us divine in the sense of being God, but it does make us divine in that we are of God.  <br>  <br>  Romans chapter 8:14-17<br>  <br>  Because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship.  And by him we cry, "Abba, Father." The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ...

Which is a mental disorder. Talk to a therapist.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you think that being otherwise normal can exclude you from having a mental disorder, then you need to educate yourself.<br>  <br>  The overwhelming majority of people experience some sort of mental illness symptom at some point in their lives. Even if it is only fleeting, like the episode you had. Mental illness is like physical illness - it can be as minor and passing as a cold, or as severe and debilitating as Parkinson's.<br>  <br>  I'm not calling you a crazy freak. I'm stating, from having studied psychology, that what you experienced is not healthy, and you should get it checked out.|`|x0giFK1Naa	The silver isn't typical OBE, but I've had enough non-typical OBEs to have no real doubt that it was one.

Each night when you go to sleep at some point everytime you go to bed your leave your body. Your not going to remember this. It happens during the deepest part of your sleep. If this happened near 5 am it could be it.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Sleep paralysis, lucid dream states, OBEs can seem similar. They are dissociative episodes but they are not necessarily signs of mental or neurological illness. Sleep paralysis is very common. For people who have it often, it typically starts during adolescence and becomes much less frequent as the person approaches middle age. I used to have sleep paralysis nearly every night when I was in my late teens. I have an episode maybe 4 times a year now (I'm 50).Panic is a common response probably because the primitive part of the brain is being activiated. The brain chemicals that make you wake up are being excreted out of order--so that your body remains paralyzed while your mind is partly waking up. What you see or experience during these episodes are elements of dream states/waking dreams/hallucinations. They are not supernatural happenings.  Sometimes (and with training) a sleep paralysis episode can transform into a lucid dream state. For me the reverse often happened: a lucid dream turned into a sleep paralysis episode. This is a state of heightened consciousness while dreaming. Certain spiritual practitioners and occultists practice having lucid dreams. Some people who can do this, do it for entertainment purposes.  <br>  <br>  OBEs naturally occur in 10% of the normal population and often occur in persons who have epilepsy or schizophrenia or other dissociative disorders. Again, having an OBE does NOT necessarily mean that something is "wrong" with you (Deja vu episodes occur in 90% of normal people but are also part of a group of symptoms experienced by people with epilepsy).  It can be learned and certain occultists and spiritual practitioners put great emphasis on learning how to do it.  It is not a supernatural event. It is caused by a paroxysm in the parietal lobes of the brain, causing confusion about the self's identity and location. OBEs occur during waking consciousness. Other temporary and idiosyncratic dissociative effects occur during dream or trance states.

He painted biblical characters like Adam and Eve, David and even Jesus to look like he knows people to look and he probably didn't think about how that's not logical...I wonder if they did have belly buttons (we will never know of course). The pictures of this type also disturb me because through time society has been lead to believe that these people were all white in skin, when in actuality if you look at people from biblical regions of the world they aren't that pale. Egyptians and people from the holy land are darker skinned people. Egypt in fact is a part of Africa. One of the ways you can tell this too was that a common disease mention in the Bible is leprosy (where people began to look white).|`|ZGelYopdaa	because the person who painted them gave it to them! its not like God painted that painting!

LisP31O8aa	Cornelis Jansen<br>  Jansenism<br>  <br>  Jansenism was strictly a Roman Catholic movement, and it had no repercussions in the Protestant world. Its fundamental purpose was a return of people to greater personal holiness, hence the characteristically mystical turn of Jansenist writings. St. Augustine's teaching on grace was especially appealing to Jansen, who stressed the doctrine that the soul must be converted to God by the action of divine grace, without which conversion could not begin. Predestination was accepted in an extreme form and was so essential to Jansenism that its adherents were even referred to as Calvinists by their opponents. But Jansenism had no appeal to Protestants, for it held the necessity of the Roman Catholic Church for salvation and opposed justification by faith alone.<br>  <br>  Jansenism, however, came into conflict with the church for its predestinarianism, for its discouragement of frequent communion for the faithful, and for its attack on the Jesuits and the new casuistry, which the Jansenists thought was demoralizing the confessional. Jansenism took root in France, especially among the clergy. There it early became involved with Gallicanism, and high officials of church and state often sided with Jansenists to thwart the Holy See.<br>  <br>  The second great Jansenist work was De la fréquente communion (1643) of Antoine Arnauld, which stirred the opposition of Jesuits and Dominicans. In 1653, Pope Innocent X condemned five of Jansen's doctrines, and in 1656 Arnauld was expelled from the Sorbonne. Meanwhile, Blaise Pascal, the greatest Jansenist, aroused a storm by his anti-Jesuit Provincial Letters, and there was persecution of the Jansenists for a while. Pasquier Quesnel published late in the 17th cent. a vernacular New Testament with Jansenist notes, which was condemned by Pope Clement XI. The aged Louis XIV undertook to suppress Jansenism, and the bulls Vineam Domini (1705) and Unigenitus (1713) virtually put the Jansenists out of the church. (Gallicanism, however, prevented the legal registration of Unigenitus in France until 1730.)<br>  <br>  The convent of Port-Royal, the greatest center of Jansenism, was closed, and most Jansenists fled France. Jansenism survived as a tendency within the church, especially in France, taking the form usually of extreme scruples with regard to communion. In the Netherlands an organization not in submission to the pope was set up. There are Jansenist bishops of Utrecht, Haarlem, and Deventer. The independent Jansenists recognize the Council of Trent and are, except for their special differences, like Roman Catholics. The first Old Catholic bishop was consecrated by Jansenists (see Old Catholics).<br>  <br>  Have you seen this ?|`|CmHLKKODaa	That's a new word for me !<br>  <br>  =0|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Our (protestant) parish used to have a vicar who once preached a Jansenist sermon  -  I told him so after the service, and he was most taken aback that anyone in the congregation should recognize such an attitude.

They were condemned as heretical by the Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Roman Catholic reform movement inspired by the writings of Cornelius Jansen. Influenced by the works of St. Augustine and especially by Augustine's attacks on Pelagianism and the doctrine of free will, Jansen adopted Augustine's doctrines of predestination and the necessity of God's grace, a stance considered uncomfortably close to Calvinism by Roman Catholic authorities, who banned his book the Augustinus in 1642. After Jansen's death in 1638, his followers made their base at the abbey in Port-Royal, France. Blaise Pascal, the most famous Jansenist, defended their teachings in his Provincial Letters (1656 – 57). In 1709 Louis XIV ordered the Port Royal abbey demolished. Followers of Jansen started a Jansenist church in 1723, which endured into the late 20th century.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/jansenism" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/jansenism</a>

By believing in God, believers hold back humanities potential.|`|RTaimrg7aa	JUst like altruistic deeds, I guess you can never be certain of the motive.  As for me it's all about reason and evidence that I believe creationism.|`|zWj6HXHNaa	But you forget that, by their god, we're nothing more than super-elaborated clay.

If small changes are cumulative, all life would blend together, there would be no fixed species. If someone claims Darwinian evolution is happening now, they would have to show the small changes form one species to another. The cumulative small changes do not exist, so Darwinian evolution is not happening now.<br>  Fossil beds contain billions of fossil that have a continuous record over millions of years, and the small change by small change fossils do not exist. New life forms appear fully developed without the small transitional links. So Darwinian evolution did not happen in the past.<br>  In reality, the theory of evolution is just imagination and wishful thinking.|`|1JmYyWvWaa	I think that's a big part of it.<br>  Personally, I like the fact that I'm related to everything. It makes me feel a sense of connectedness I could never feel with any god.

However, there is more to creation then any of you realize.  By the way, the big bang theory has nothing to do with creation.  Just because we are more intelligent to believe that we did not evolve from monkeys is no reason for people to speak ignorantly.  Buy yourself a monkey and wait till he evolves in to a human and let me know.  It will never happen because it never happened.  It just does not make sense. The whole fact, whether you believe in the BBT or Mud Puddle theory or whatever, there would half to be a million coincidences to make this world and solar system to work the way it does.  Just the fact that a baby is born of man and woman, and not the evolution of an ape.  If any of you knew scientifically what occurred from inception to the birth of a baby you would start  to understand creation.  The fact that the Bible explains creation and how God spoke it into existence is more evidence then any one who believes in evolution can produce.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  It seems they have a desire to be the laughing stock for christians, atheists and all the other religions!!

Yzcptoagaa	It's possible, but here's the problem: all land in the U.S. is owned, either privately or by the people (i.e. government) collectively.  If you go live by yourself in the woods and have no income and no one knows you're there, then you can be left alone.  You still have to obey laws.  For example, you can't kill people in your house and expect not to be prosecuted.<br>  <br>  But if whoever owns the land finds you are there and decides to evict you or charge you rent, then they have a right to do that.  It is possible that you could become the owner of the land if you stay there long enough, but then if you are discovered you could be made to pay property taxes.

baC3UdzHaa	Yes...much...it is the anthem of humanity. One can be overly optimistic and confident about their past failures, or one can be overly pessemistic.

uBkvqcY6aa	I think once you start you'll get a feel for it.  The easiest way is if you and your partner both understand that you're "experimenting" and need to find your way.  Your partner should be able to guide you and let you know what feels good and what doesn't.  Yes a condom makes a difference, it kills lubrication in your mouth like crazy so I would say take a break every so often and allow your mouth to salivate a bit.  Otherwise it could be rough for both of you.  Good luck.|`|88vcImqiaa	From what you say in your question, it is unlikely you would ever be very good at it.

zPfgFXU5aa	It is one of the JW verses, but their theory ignores the fact that Michael is only a prince while Jesus is the king of kings, Lord of lords.<br>  <br>  Ask a JW to show you “the Scriptures” that say Jesus is Michael. There are none. <br>  <br>  The Watchtower Society's own Bible,  New World Translation (NWT) mentions Michael five times as: 1) "one of the foremost princes" (Dan. 10:13); 2) "the prince of [Daniel's] people" (Dan. 10:21); 3) "the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of [Daniel's] people" (Dan. 12:1); 4) “the archangel” who "had a difference with the devil and was disputing about Moses body" but "did not dare to bring a judgment against him in abusive terms" (Jude 9); and 5) a participant in heavenly conflict when "Michael and his angels battled with the dragon" (Rev. 12:7).<br>  <br>    <br>  Which one of these verses says that Michael is Jesus Christ?<br>  <br>  To reach that conclusion it is necessary to read Scripture plus a complicated Watchtower argument. <br>  <br>  What they fail to see is rather than being merely "one of the foremost princes," Jesus Christ is "Lord of lords and King of kings" (Rev. 17:14, NWT) and is "far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name named, not only in this system of things, but also in that to come" (Ephesians 1:21, NWT). And, unlike "Michael who did not dare condemn the Devil with insulting words, but said, The Lord rebuke you!" (Jude 9), Jesus Christ displayed His authority over the devil when He freely commanded him, "Go away, Satan!" (Matthew 4:10, NWT)|`|mNyhRGowaa	They have newly written bibles (1950) written by their governing body. they never read scripture in entirety because they know they are preaching a false doctrine. When you talk to them they say turn to this verse turn to that verse, they direct with a preformed format that leans toward their false teaching of works and worldliness. they have predicted the end numerous times with actual dates when in fact Christ said know one knows the time except the Father, so do they super-cede CHRIST and what he said about the times? I think not .Beware of the false prophets even the ones who are with us today!|`|s7pqFa1eaa	You are trying to make sense out of non-sense, that will never work.

He choose Micheal as this figure of Christ in the book of Daniel, because the name of bright Star was not yet given, like He told us in the book Jerimiah and to Moses in Exodus 4, by this name they have not known Me, Jer 4:22 For my people [is] foolish, they have not known me; they [are] sottish children, and they have none understanding: they [are] wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

I'm not saying that Jesus was married, but I don't believe it would have been a sin for him to be married.<br>  <br>  Edit: The manditory law for celebacy of Catholic priests is considered a church law & not a law of God. Declared at the council of Trent in the 16th century.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	It would not be a sin, but it would not have been wise.<br>  <br>  It would have done nothing to help spread the Gospel.<br>  <br>  Jesus' ministry only lasted 3 years and after that his wife if he had one would have been a widow.<br>  <br>  Jesus' uncles, cousins and brothers were hunted down and killed by angry Jews and Romans, so who would have cared for the wife of Jesus? After all, he had to give his mother Mary over to John because John was the only one destined to survive and live to an old age.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, there would be a risk that a cult would form around the wife of jesus and she would be elevated by the people to an almost god-like status and distract people from worshipping God the father. History shows us that is exactly what they did with Mary!<br>  <br>  So all things considered it would have been most unwise for Jesus to have married.|`|wQJL3b3Naa	THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is actually the bridegroom and HE is married to HIS spouse which is the church. Also the spirtual mystery is that the Bridegroom will be the spouse of all souls as all souls are she either they have male or female bodies.Since THE LORD JESUS CHRIST was a man-GOD, HIS  marrage is more spiritual in nature and not carnal as we normally know it among natural men.

Marriage is good. Intimacy is good. Children are good. It just wasn't what Jesus came here to do. He didn't come here to have a family; He came to be the sacrifice for our sins. Marriage would have interfered.<br>  <br>  BTW - the law of priests remaining celibate is unbiblical. The Bible said that there would be some who would preach "doctrines of devils" - forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats. Sounds very Catholic, and God calls it demonic doctrine.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	The ban on marriage only applies to the Priest′s in the Roman Rite. The Orthodox Russian and Greek Churches′s permit their priests to marry. However, if the wife dies they are not permitted to remarry. The reason for the ban on marriage is for economic reasons, nothing else.<br>  If Jesus married it would not have been a sin, because God the Father would have willed it.

ridu0Rtwaa	Scientists have synthesized RNA enzymes that can replicate themselves without the help of any proteins or other cellular components, and the process proceeds indefinitely!!<br>  <br>  In the modern world, DNA carries the genetic sequence for advanced organisms, while RNA is dependent on DNA for performing its roles such as building proteins. But one prominent theory about the origins of life, called the RNA World model, postulates that because RNA can function as both a gene and an enzyme, RNA might have come before DNA and protein and acted as the ancestral molecule of life.<br>  <br>  Researchers generated a variety of enzyme pairs with similar capabilities in a molecular test of survival of the fittest. Most of the time the replicating enzymes would breed true, but on occasion an enzyme would make a mistake by binding one of the subunits from one of the other replicating enzymes. When such "mutations" occurred, the resulting recombinant enzymes also were capable of sustained replication, with the most fit replicators growing in number to dominate the mixture. <br>  <br>  The research shows that the system can sustain molecular information, a form of heritability, and give rise to variations of itself in a way akin to Darwinian evolution.<br>  <br>  But you should also realise that the Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  Seems your views are setting yourself up to be the laughingstock for christians and atheists alike!!|`|gGmMw2vDaa	I can see how you have such a simplistic view of science.

I kind of try to stay out of judging the whole gay thing because really, as a straight person, it's pretty hard for me to imagine the situation.  I'm not completely convinced that I really have an accurate idea of what God thinks about homosexuality. <br>  <br>  I do know at least one gay Catholic who is part of an interfaith program to make him straight.  I hope it makes him happy, but I don't believe that it is making him straight.|`|8tF9Py9Daa	Absolutely not.  Sexual orientation is hard-wired into our brains long before we exit the womb.<br>  <br>  When I was a teen in the 1960s and '70s, struggling horribly with my "socially unacceptable" orientation, I prayed daily to be "straight."  It's obvious to me God wanted me to be gay for His own reasons.  (And thank God for two totally loving parents who had NO problem with me being gay.  If they could love a gay son, so can God.)<br>  <br>  Ex-gay ministries are frauds, plain and simple.  While they may convince people to date and even marry the opposite sex, those poor people are still gay and always will be so.

But God would not expect a person to not do homosexual acts and also make him attracted to the same sex.  It would be cruel to do so.  You can materially have a defect (removed by a miracle) in your body that inclines you that way.  But more likely if someone felt no longer inclined to live a homosexual lifestyle, they were spiritually and psychologically healed if they turned to God for it.  The way you think is part of the explanation.  If you allow impure thoughts to enter your mind, your body will be more likely to draw your mind to pleasure however you may get it.  So homosexual acts are just another way, and if you attach your thoughts to something like a fetish, that will also arouse you.  <br>  <br>  It is not possible for me to believe that God could make someone "homosexual".  I do not believe there is such a thing.  But I also believe most anyone can have homosexual feelings if they act or think with enough impurity.|`|ytqvP3Tbaa	All things are possible with God , He has helped make  druggies &gang leaders pastors..He has also lead gays down the path to be straight and they have married .helped alcoholics become dry .

He can give her comfort through her pain and take her to be with Him in heaven when she dies. All she needs to do is ask and trust that He will answer. I would also encourage her to forgive those who sinned against her- holding on to that anger will only hurt her and get in the way of her closeness with God. Just because he was not executed does not mean he won't suffer some punishment.|`|CsJl15U7aa	I would advise she ask her husband for forgiveness, then pray to the LORD for HIS forgiveness and ask to be spared the most painful blows.  In other words, let the first blow be the deadly one then she won't feel the rest.  If her husband truly loves her and forgives her, he will be the one to deal that blow to spare her the pain.  Then she needs to accept her punishment without hysterics.  <br>  <br>  In the example given about "those without sin, cast the first stone"  that was a trap to prove Jesus as a false "prophet".  HE knew she was innocent of the crime they were accusing her of.  She was not married or betrothed and was a free agent.  Notice they didn't bring forth the man who apparently was as guilty as she would have been if there had been a crime.  Her accusers disappeared, therefore no crime was committed.  In the above example, the girl was married, was caught as was the man.  They both were found guilty, they both should stand punishment.  Unfortunately, she was born into a society where women and children are viewed as property.  The man paid for damaging the goods, so to speak, and paid a dear price to keep his life.  She has no such recourse, save that the husband could have chosen to divorce her.  Her life would have been a living misery.  Perhaps in some societies death is considered a kindness.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I don't know what I would do, but i can tell you what my Lord did. He looked at the ones that were going to stone that girl, which was the law of the day, and yes, it does seem to man got away with it, and told the ones that were without sin to cast the first stone- and then he said to the girl- GO AND SIN NO MORE.  He was not excusing her sin, He was making the point that those men were sinners as well.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	There is nothing you could say to comfort anyone who was going to suffer punishment like that.

9WMaZdQWaa	I never have, but my friend says she has.  (By the way, I don't have strong opinions, either way, about whether ghosts exist.)  The apartment she and her mom used to live in was a two-bedroom flat, and her mom's room had one wall that was completely mirrored.  When she was in there one day, she saw a young man standing behind her in the mirror, but when she turned around there was no one there.  Her mom told her she was just seeing things, but after that, she didn't go back into the room.  Several times, when she was in the hallway, she saw the doorknob turning on it's own, when there was no one in the bedroom.

A friend's husband had died and I was staying with her. Before she went to bed, she had asked me if she should bury him with or without his wedding ring. Not wanting to make the decision for her, I suggested she sleep on it. A little later, she headed to bed and I stayed in the living room, reading. <br>  <br>  The dog, which had been very close to the husband, jumped up and trotted into the hallway and stopped. The hair on the back of the dog was raised and It began growl, slowly and in a non-threatening way, almost like it was confused.  I walked down the hallway past the dog and looked into my friend's bedroom. A round ball of light, muddled and not bright, swished away from the dresser toward her, where she was sleeping in the bed. I hadn't opened any doors, or turned on any lights. The room was otherwise dark.<br>  <br>  The next day she found her husband's wedding ring on the dresser, but it had been in the drawer. She was pretty puzzled over it, and she thought maybe she had removed the ring from the drawer before bed, and put it on the dresser. When I first saw the ball of light, it was stationary at the precise place where the ring was found.<br>  <br>  Until that incident, I was neither a skeptic, nor believer in ghosts. Obviously, I'm no longer a skeptic.|`|b1cVZbX7aa	No, I don't believe in ghosts.<br>  Once there were a news here that some people were taking some photos in front of a old empty house, and in one photo, there was a ghost near a window. That photo spread through mobiles and it was believed that the house was haunted. Then it was found that these people edited the photo and inserted the picture of the ghost from internet, to fool people. The picture was in newspapers. Oh! It was so funny.|`|XO8vuIaDaa	Yes I have.  It was a year ago at my parent's house.  I was eating lunch on the deck in the backyard and I saw my dead dog Katrinka sitting there staring at me.  At that point she had been dead a year.  I did not freak out until a little later.  In fact now I find it was a happy experience.  I was 300 miles away when she died and she was a member of the family.  So I got to see her one last time.<br>  <br>  ~Random E.P.|`|DWFMM23Caa	yep i seen one that looked like the siloutte of my grandad walk down my street, it was a really foggy evening and my street has a one way traffic system, the siloutte was walking towards the traffic and if it was human it would have been killed in a flash... freaky!

zWj6HXHNaa	They were all part of the 42 Egyptian commandments. Which in fact, are more moral than the Hebrew.|`|VzCygD6taa	It would seem reasonable that the 10 commandment were written in Hebrew.  <br>  The first record of the word Hebrew in the Bible is found in –<br>  <br>  Genesis 14:13  <br>  And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. <br>  <br>  Since Abram is called a Hebrew, it is not unreasonable to think that he spoke and wrote the language at this time.  Several hundreds of years before Moses was born and was the language of the people who lived in Goshen and Moses lead out of Egypt.  <br>  <br>  Speculation that Hebrew is based on the Phoenician alphabet is just that speculation.  It is equally posible that Phoenician alphabet was based on the Hebrew alphabet.|`|AA10471892	Poor research.  Phoenician was the parent language for Hebrew and even Greek.  Phoenician has its eventual roots in the hieroglyphic writing of Egyptian.  When Moses wrote the 5 books of the Penteteuch, it was an early form of Hebrew, extremely similar to the Phoenician at that time.  Your argument is like saying the letter "l" existed in the Phoenician before there was Hebrew, therefore the Hebrew can't have the letter "l".|`|WQvqLnnhaa	They were written by the hand of God.... Most likely would have been in Aramaic.<br>  Moses was brought up Egyptian and was taught from a young boy where he came from. And he spent 40 years in the wilderness with Hebrews before the Exodus.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Well, it would have been written in the Hebrew language.<br>  <br>  If the only written language at the time was Egyptian heiroglyphs (or the text of the Syrians) then it was presumably written in this. I understand that you could technically write another language in Egyptian heiroglyphs, because the symbols can represent sounds (like Chinese characters).|`|ULUpOqplaa	About 8 of the 10 were part of the Egyptian book of the dead which Moses was familiar with.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	Most people at that time  knew both Hebrew and Egyptian. My guess would be that they were written in Hebrew because the slaves that Moses freed were Hebrew.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	They were etched by God in a language that Moses could understand...........probably Hebrew

Bible = Hate. I wish Christians would either embrace that and show us the sort of people they are (like the Phelps do) or renounce their disturbingly harmful and bizarre religion. <br>  <br>  Long may the Phelps spew their stupid, hateful dogma. Every word proves the idiotic and mean spirited nature of homophobia.|`|DbxOLpddaa	who is this doris???????????|`|AA12158476	The Phelps family get plenty, to the point that they even have an alternate phone number at the church for them, talk about egos. <br>  <br>  Doris do you have a number we can call you at or do yours go there also?|`|08QtgdpOaa	Oh, Doris, you're back. Hmm. How unfortunate for all of us.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I would think that they do get many death threats. She's a hate monger.
S8pIwxpwaa	Practice enough that you feel comfortable looking at your notes or speech very briefly and then making eye contact with your audience.<br>  <br>  Use one hand to emphasize points. For an example of what I'm talking about, watch Barack Obama (a genius at public speaking no matter what you think of the man) speak.<br>  <br>  Use a video camera to record your speech. Put the camera in the position where an audience member would be, and then give your speech. Play it back and note the following:<br>  <br>  1) Are you making eye contact every once in awhile?<br>  2) Is your voice inflecting (good)? Or is it monotone (boring)? And does it sound natural?<br>  <br>  Don't use powerpoint as a crutch. If possible, don't use it at all.|`|AA11108306	So people would be impressed, always look them straight in the eye even if you're reading something.  Meaning glace at the audience every now and then.<br>  <br>  But if you mean, to control your nerves, which understably is difficult, then I suggest you just concentrate on your speech and don't think about what they'll think of you.  It's worked for me.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think the best advice I ever got was to pick one (or a few) person you feel comfortable talking to, and direct the speech/presentation at them.  Also try to speak at a normal pace...I've found when nervous people (myself included) speed up to rush through.|`|b8cdf790051c7a23d5dda74ea5c8efc4aa	Prepare the text well.  Use short sentences. Rehearse. Ask a friend/ family member to listen to you.. Be relaxed while speaking. Speak with deliberation and conviction.Identify some kindly persons in the audince ( Plant them if need be) and look at them while speaking.<br>  Imagine you are addressing a class of young persons/ novices who are keen to learn from you.|`|2zkcZNx0aa	make sure you obtain regular eye contact with as many people as possible<br>  <br>  speak slower than you normally would<br>  talk to everyone, not just those straight ahead<br>  use hand gestures, and dont stand reallly still on the spot<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Ww5HHN6maa	Have two shots of Gin first...just enough to take the edge off  lol|`|scyLaz0saa	Make sure you are comfortable with the speaking material.  If you know the material back ways and side ways it should be easy to speak.  Know your audience.  I try and introduce myself to people in the room so it feels like I am talking with friends.  Practice.... Practice.... Practice.  Make sure you keep with the time limit.  Finally your notes or cue cards should not have full sentences. It should be main points or facts that need to go in your speech in order.  If your new and speaking you may want to keep the full sentences (if it is for a class you will get points taken off for not looking at the audience).  Finally have fun.  Find your comfort zone on stage and go for it. :) Good luck to you.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Effective public speaking means being well-prepared, well-rehearsed and making frequent eye contact with your audience.  I love public speaking now, but didn't when I was younger.  The trick I used is to practice in front of a mirror so I'd see what the audience was seeing.  It's a great way to catch yourself making unconscious gestures.|`|d863ecefd6c767699eb44adca4e572ebaa	Know what you are going to say, practice, practice, practice. DO NOT PRETEND TO BE FRIGHTENED OR UNCOMFORTABLE! You might be a little of both, but don't feed that dragon. You know you are going to do well. As soon as you start, you will begin to relax, and your speech will be received well.|`|eNulfbs7aa	Number one BREATHE! Try to relax!  You need to practice at home in front of a mirror or better yet...in front of a video camera.  You must write whatever you are going to talk about down...several times...therefore becoming a true believer and honestly educated on what topic you are addressing.  Try to relax shoulders...learn to not look people in the eyes but in the middle of their forehead..it looks like you are looking at them in the eyes but you won't feel as intimidated.  If this is for school..it is different than for work..If I knew which one..I could give you more advice.  The most important thing is to BREATHE...pause in between talking..people get nervous and RUSH through things..you must relax and breathe.  The more you practice in front of the camera..the more you can critique yourself and see what needs to  be adjusted...practice standing...go to you tube..i bet you can find some videos and tips that you can visually see.  Good luck..more details..more help will come|`|Yi7AR18qaa	I actually get really nervous before I do a speech, so I take a little bit of Nyquil to relax my mind and cool my nerves. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone though.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	speak with confident, make sure you are loud enough. imagine everyone in the crowd is your best friend. practice the speech before doing it for real. and always relax|`|syWxjxu8aa	dont be nervous and be prepared|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	dont hide behind what you're reading. speak loudly and clearly. make eye contact with a few people in the audience ;)|`|AA11107195	Be confident in what you're saying and become as educated on what you're talking about as possible. Most of the time, the people don't necessarily know what you're talking about, so if you can get your point across confidently, it can help your speech.|`|sbHjYxGtaa	if reading from something, look at what your reading for a bit  and look up and say what...well what you remember and when you almost can't remember look down again briefly and look up again. they key it to speak out and look at the audience.

I think I'm starting to see the benefits of believing in evolution.  When I look at the world in which we live and say to myself: "Wow, once none of this existed.  Then in a moment of absolute luck on the grandest scale possible--BOOM!--everything was set in motion to ... to ... work out."  My new God is luck.  FORGET thinking that an amighty God created all of this!  Yes, there IS a design to everything!  And the best scientists can hope to do is to explain the design's inner workings, but I now bow at the dual alters of luck and chance, chance and luck.  I'm TIRED of being made fun of for my "blind faith" in God.  No more!  I'm not really sure what luck and chance are, but THERE is where my faith lies now!  Yesiree!  Luck and chance!<br>  <br>  Examples of how luck has served us so well:<br>  <br>  1. Just the right amount of atmosphere<br>  2. Just the right distance from the sun<br>  3. Just the right amount of gravity<br>  4. Just the right amount of water<br>  5. Just the right tilt on the earth's axis<br>  6. Just the right rotational speed<br>  7. Just the right placement in space<br>  <br>  Here on earth ...<br>  <br>  1. I can hardly believe the luck of the water cycle and<br>  2. The luck behind weather and<br>  3. The luck behind plate tectonics and<br>  4. The luck that rain and wind cleanse the atmosphere and<br>  5. The luck that high and low pressure systems work in accord and<br>  6. The luck that insects till the earth and<br>  7. The luck that every life form has a way of reproducing and<br>  <br>  And even without the human body, I can't believe the luck found in the intricacies of the human brain, the eye, the heart, the lungs, the circulatory system, the digestive system, and more!<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if luck is LADY luck or some other luck.  I'll have to read up on that.  I'm not sure if chance is a sister force to luck or the same force of a different name.  After all, I'm early in my worship of luck and chance, give me time!  But I worship--is that too strong of a word?--luck and chance.  They've been so kind to us.<br>  <br>  But when those stupid fundies ask me the hard questions, I'm still not sure what I'm going to say about certain things.  Examples:<br>  <br>  1. What force drives luck and chance?<br>  2. How do we EXPLAIN luck and chance scientifically?  I mean, THEY explain God as best they can.  We GET that God is a life form that can set events in motion.  While I now know that's wrong, I don't have any way of explaining luck or chance as a similar force.<br>  3. Does luck and chance have a thought capacity?  I mean, when we say luck shined on us, does that mean we found favor with luck?  If so, can one incur luck's wrath?  I have been unlucky before!<br>  4. I'm still stumped on this one.  Okay, sure, sure ... all life came from a primordial slime.  NOT GOD!  Primordial slime.  Got it!  But how is it that it in effect evolved TWICE each so that there's a male and a female form?  And ... how did each of these similar yet different life forms figure out that ... hey, we can hook up and create MORE life?  Wow, THAT IS LUCK!!!  <br>  <br>  Luck, you're the best!  You make evolution make so much sense.  I worship you ... luck.  And chance.  And ... I think I'm going to throw up.

3b6eEugsaa	Of course- the Bible wasn't written by God himself, it was written by man's perception of God's messages. There are so many different versions of the Bible that its not possible for all of the to be accurate. <br>  <br>  You may not be Christian, but the same general idea applies for all religions. <br>  <br>  It is very reasonable to believe that there is a greater being without believing the books written by man.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Absolutely. I am a strong Christian and I believe in God with all my heart, but I believe that the Bible was written by men, and men are not perfect. While the Bible does have many good messages and things to teach us, it is not perfect, and should not be taken quite so seriously. And, most important, should never be used to condemn.<br>  <br>  It's honestly quite dumb to think that the Bible is perfectly accurate, since there are many different versions. King James Version might not always agree with New International Version, and so on.|`|8hyxabYOaa	dude, i DEFINITELY believe in god. but NOT the bible, or any source of religious literature for that matter. why? because GOD did not write those books. human beings did. and who are WE to say that god, this great omniscient being, wants us to follow all these rules and regulations in order to be loved by him?<br>  GOD WANTS US TO BE HAPPY. not NARROWMINDED FOLLOWERS.|`|Gkf2nS51aa	You can Believe in whatever you want,  not all the stories in the bible are true,, but they do all have a deep meaning, that'ss is the real point of everystoreye, just to pick up on the hidden meaning.

A book is just something written down after all, and people believed in most of the currently popular deities long before people could write or read books.  <br>  <br>  In history it's called oral traditions, and I suggest the naysayers look it up.  Even most of the teachings of Christ were primarily oral traditions for about 300 years before they were written down.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|19PgkkFWaa	Well christians tend to have this thing that just cause something is in the bible makes it true...but in reality you need evidence to make something true remember evolution has alot of evidence...christians don't|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	If you mean the bible by saying "a book"...<br>  NO , you cannot believe in God and not believe in everything that God has written for us in His Word, His Word is truth...and if you don't believe it, then you do not believe in God, because you cannot separate God from His Word...not possible...|`|WSIZKAQcaa	I do, to some extant.

It's called having a relationship with God. God hates religion because all it does is cause hate and fights and stuff. If I had to classify myself as something, it would be Christian, but I don't need to, because God knows how I feel about him. I might not always follow the Bible or completely understand or believe it, but I do ask Him to guide me through life and he knows I'm not perfect :)|`|zezIM9B5aa	Absolutely. The Patagonian tribe of Tierra del Fuego used to be considered a horde of cannibals. Two missionaries in the 1920's were admitted into the tribe's initiation ceremonies. The tribe leaders referred to their God as "The Holy One", "Ancient One in Heaven" and the "Almighty. Before they went to sleep at night, the father's would say " May the Heavenly Father grant us all to see a new and happy day". And these people had never even seen a bible.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Yes. I believe in God and follow the teachings of the Christ but I do not believe in the Bible. It  is definitely NOT the Word of God. <br>  <br>  If God really wanted to write a book Jesus would have done it Himself and there would be no questions about it. It would also be a very different book.<br>  <br>  No matter how inspired the authors were or by what source, the information had to filter through their minds and personalities. The Bible was written by men immersed in an ancient patriarchal culture. They all had agendas, whether it was keeping the social order, unifying doctrine, eliminating heresy or gaining converts. For me, it's a pretty transparent piece of propaganda.<br>  <br>  What I do value in the Bible is the story of Christ's life and teachings. I think He knew how misinterpreted and manipulated words can become and therefore lived in a way that would allow us to follow in His footsteps regardless of what anyone wrote about Him.<br>  <br>  The links below objectively detail the origins of the Bible (1)<br>  as well as the inconsistencies and inaccuracies (2)|`|HqrU9RJOaa	Yup.

They used to not let people read the Bible because "Only priests could understand it."<br>  <br>  Almost all of their beliefs are taken from ancient Pagan beliefs. <br>  <br>  They baptize their babies, which it's written in the Bible that that is a sin, because being baptized is you willingly choosing to live for Jesus, so forcing a baby to become baptized is wrong.<br>  <br>  They come up with their own rules/doctrines based on what they read "between the lines" from the Bible... <br>  <br>  I could continue..|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Faith flew planes into buildings.

That's suicidal.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Ryan, I think you are basing your feelings on a few fleeting experiences. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church is a lot bigger than your parish and your life experiences and your family. <br>  <br>  Annulments are actually a mercy. Without them, divorced Catholics could never marry again. The Church understands that being alone would be very hard, so they came up with a way to help people who were never in a valid marriage to begin with be free of any obligation to the first spouse so that they can marry again. And the only costs that are incurred are related to processing paperwork or gathering testimonials or something like that -- if they have to hire people to get the information they need, those people deserve to be paid, don't they?<br>  <br>  Now then, about going to Mass on Sunday. Why, of course it's a sin to refuse to worship the Lord. That's what Mass is for. If you refuse to sacrifice one hour a week for God, you can't possibly love Him very much. And if you don't love Him, why would you want to be stuck with Him for all eternity in heaven? You'd be CHOOSING hell, because there's no God there to bother you. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you are still young. It's good for you to be asking questions -- but don't just ask and then sit around stewing. Look for the answers. INSIST on getting the answers. Doesn't the annulment thing make more sense now?|`|8OeulLkmaa	there is something very attractive about the catholic faith.  I like the sign of the cross, the rosary, the confession...the really old movies portray the catholic church as something beautiful.<br>  <br>  It's when I got into theologically that I had huge problems with it and realized that I could never be catholic.  <br>  I suggest reading a bible for yourself, KJV preferably or the new living translation.  It sounds like you don't have a personal relationship with God so reading the Bible is a good way to start.<br>  <br>  BTW, I am protestant and have never been catholic.  I have always found the religion very attractive though.  I think it had to do with the rituals.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	I love my Catholic faith! And just to set the record straight, nobody gets divorced for free! Trying to get their way is the way of the world. That is one reason there is so much war and crime. The Church is older and wiser than any human organization in existence. What she teaches today, is what she learned from Christ and the Apostles. That is unchanging. Cultures become more immoral, and demand rules change to accommodate them. The Church doesn't do that. Converting to a protestant tradition doesn't mean the rules given by Christ don't count. Did you know that no Christian denomination allowed birth control untin 1930? The Anglican church changed their rules and their doctrin, and within about 20 yrs, all protestants allowed it. That is bending to cultural pressure. It is not teaching Gods laws. Pax Christ|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	Yes, it's full of so many different avenues of worship and veneration.  Each parish is unique.  While the liturgy and mass may be a cookie cutter style in each church, the flavor of each parish is different.<br>  <br>  All organized religious groups try to get their way in politics and finances.  Grow up honey!|`|ItjUfDplaa	I like how the Catholic church has a strong emphasis on helping the poor.<br>  <br>  I wasn't too happy when the Pope commented on our political system here in the US. He apparently doesn't understand separation of church and state.|`|AA11466759	Yes, I do, but the church I grew up in didn't have crazy people in it like yours did...or maybe I just overlooked all that stuff and stared straight into the depths beyond....not that I go to church anymore though|`|5bzJUmh4aa	The Catholics are no worse than other Christians in this regard.  Most Christians will tell you Catholics are all going to hell.  I respect the Catholics for actually trying to hold their members to a standard of behavior.  Since they believe in faith + works, there are actually some requirements to get into heaven.  Most other Christians believe you get into heaven by faith alone.  This means you can do whatever you want - lie, cheat, steal, murder, get divorced, etc., as long as you "accept Jesus" (whatever that means) and repent.  At least the Catholics make you go to confession and do some sort of penance.  I say stick with the Catholic Church, if for no other reason than to piss off the fundies.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Catholics ARE brainwashed. Just like every other religion.<br>  <br>  The Catholics are responsible for an uncountable number of murders, which still go on to this day (read about the barbaric acts of the Catholic Church in South America).<br>  <br>  Religion is a tool that people who want power use to control other people, or "sheep" as they call them. It has nothing to do with god. It is a brainwashing tool for social power. That's it.<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist, personally. And I'd like to be very clear about something: I do not oppose people being spirtual, or believing in a higher power. What I think is dangerous, and what I oppose, is religion. The organized, calculated leadership of a cult, usually for the purposes of power. And cults can be secular too. But understand that religion is a cult.<br>  <br>  If you want to believe in god, that's fine with me. But you don't need to belong to a religion to do it. And why would you, when religion has caused so much death and destruction in the world? Why would you support a legacy of hate?|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Certain priests, teachers, and other Catholics excepted, the closer you look at the authentic Catholic faith, the better it gets.<br>  <br>  In so far as the objections you've mentioned ... once you get to fully understand Catholicism, you'll be able to tell in a second whether somebody is telling you the truth or not. <br>  <br>  And this is the truth about annulments: God hates divorce, and no Catholic can get a divorce from a marriage that is truly valid.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot of time and effort to investigate and determine whether grounds for annulment even exist.<br>  <br>  People need to get paid for the work they do. And compared to the cost of a divorce, the annulment, if granted, is the biggest bargain in the world.<br>  <br>  The alternative is either living alone, or living in a permanent state of adultery and mortal sin.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church has a divine mandate and a sacred duty to work for the common good of society and for the salvation of souls.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean "getting their way" in politics and finances. It means social justice and God given human rights for everyone, and especially for the least of us.<br>  <br>  According to Jesus Christ, and Catholic Canon Law  section 212, that responsibility is yours, as well.<br>  <br>  Better get busy. You have lots of work to do!|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	First of all, priests don't talk like that, and such an atittude about any alleged bank robber is contrary to the mind of the Church, so your story is second hand or just bogus. <br>  <br>  Cheating is not necessarily grounds for divorce, because cheating can be forgiven and healed. Such an idea is the Protestant misinterpretation of 2 Bible verses. Lots of people leave the Catholic church because we don't believe a person should marry into an adulterous relationship. I'm sorry that upsets you. <br>  <br>  Lots of teachers do stupid things. Grow up and get over it. <br>  <br>  You want the Church to be shut up and ineffectual in the affairs of the world. Try looking at some Catholic news web sites and see what the Church is doing, and stop reading all that anti-Catholic crap that Protestants pump out. We don't do that to them.  Maybe you should ask why Catholics don't formally persecute Protestants with lies and falsehoods the way we get it from them.|`|NJpihlsHaa	The reason that I don't agree with Catholicism (and I am a Christian) is that they have put more emphasis on tradition than on helping people develop a personal relationship with God. There are so many customs and things that have to be followed in the Catholic church that I feel there is hardly any push towards finding the faith side of faith and works. I believe faith needs to come first and works alone cannot save. That's obviously just my opinion. And I know what you mean and agree with you in saying that it seems like kind of a business and less of a journey to develop a divine relationship.|`|YNMnVjltaa	When I was in college, I struggled with a lot of the things you mentioned. I saw all the corruption with members of the Church and it turned me off to the Faith.  I stopped believing in God for a number of years.<br>  <br>  However, just because you may know a lot of unholy Catholics, this does not mean the teachings of the Church are incorrect.  The Church continues despite all the corruption. The fact that it hasn't destroyed itself by now suggests it is under the protection of the Holy Spirit. I did manage to find a Franciscan church in the inner city with an excellent pastor and many cloistered nuns.  I met a lot of great people there too.  I'd recommend praying to Our Lady of Good Counsel to recommend a church for you to attend.  She answers the prayers of the humble:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend spending time at Eucharistic Adoration.  The great thing about being Catholic is that we have Jesus physically present in the Eucharist. Eucharistic Adoration can help you feel closer to God and have a personal relationship with Him.<br>  <br>  May God bless you!|`|AA12048417	As Karl Marx said, religion is a drug.

I don't care much|`|4VouLn4waa	My GF is Catholic. Until i started dating her i never knew how much i have disliked the catholic faith. It seems everything she does or doesnt do is going to send her to hell. I think its bull how they are so controlling. If it isnt done through them, its not holy. If i were to marry her outside of the catholic church, then we would not be recognized as being married. Who gives a **** if they acknowledge our marriage. As long as we are engaged in holy matrimony i am sure that is fine in the eyes of god. and confession WOW. how easy! i can do what ever i want as long as go tell a priest and swear i wont ever do it again. Of course such a strict religion would have to have an easy button, or else all of there members would think they were going to burn in hell. And they are so manipulative, ppl are so ignorant that they have lost the ability to think for themselves and ask their own questions. If the church says it, it is fact. I have had more than enough of the churches dogma bull. And the last thing i will address (but definitly not the last of the things i have against the church) is weekly titheing. Now i am not gonna single out the catholic church for capitalizing on peoples faith in god and gullibility, but that catholics have taken a step further. they insist that if you are married in the catholic church, you need to raise you children catholic! thats a very convenient way to increase membership. back to titheing (giving 10% of your anual income the church) people dont realize how much a church makes, they justify it by saying it is used to pay bills. Open your eyes! thats why your priest has a bigger house than you! Take this for example, a church with 50 members (an extremely small church) and they each make 40,000 a year (a relatively low income). If they all were to follow the law of titheing established in the old testament and enforced by jesus, the church would be making $200,000 a year, that pays a lot more than electric bills. And keep in mind that is a small church with poor members.<br>  If this isnt enough to open anyones eyes let me know so that i can continue|`|po85q148aa	Ok ... I'm Christian (non denominational).  I just don't understand the Catholic religion.  I have many friends who are Catholic too.  But before I start please forgive me if I say anything to offend anybody.  That's not my intention.  And if somebody wants to break it down for me ... please do so.  However ... I just feel that Catholics add a lot of stuff to their faith as does many other denominations.  And that's the reason I'm non denominational.  But I don't know why Catholics pray to Mary.  I don't understand why Catholics pray to different saints.  I don't understand why Catholics have a reading of rights (sorry if that's not the proper name for it).  I mean none of these are found in my Bible.  Oh and why do Catholics have additional books added to their Bible?  I just don't get it.  I've asked many Catholics to tell me a story or two from their Bible (Catholics that have been going to church from the time they were born) and they couldn't.  My husband even had one Catholic say the church discouraged them from reading their Bible.  Could it just be that church?  Possibly.  But still.  It just seems like they have added sooooooo many things that aren't mentioned in the Bible.  And that ... worries me.  Not to mention anytime I refer to a Catholic as a Christian they say and I quote "I am not a Christian.  I am Catholic."  What?  And these are Catholics from different churches.  And I could go on and on forever.<br>  <br>  But yes you would still be Christian.<br>  <br>  Oh and what about confessing your sins through the priest?  My Bible doesn't say to do that.  My Bible doesn't say I can only be forgiven through my Priest/Pastor.  Wow.|`|rbyVBMIIaa	I think that beliefs have become too much about religion.  What you believe is what you believe, and there shouldn't be any rituals to define that.  If you believe in Jesus and have accepted him, then it doesn't matter if you're Protestant or Catholic or you live in some far off country and can't go to church.  It's your relationship with God that makes the difference.<br>  <br>  So go to any church you want, but know that you aren't defined by that, only by what you believe.|`|qI9k9lJVaa	I go to a catholic school but I dont have a religion. It might not be the faith, just the people running the church you go to. They dont brainwash us at school and dont say things like that. Think things over and maybe try a different church.|`|fWWHMDWQaa	You kind of feel?? <br>  They don't even have to brain wash you half the time cause people just wanna to believe so much. It's so frustrating|`|AweC7pHgaa	Jesus Christ did not have a "church" he was a traveling "preacher" you could say, but i do not think the word preacher is the right word to describe him. If you think your Catholic church is brainwashing you, then you are probably right. I would advise you to take the spiritual road that i have taken. Jesus Christ did not have these modern names for religions that we currently have. In his opinion (im assuming) You are either A. a non-follower, or B. a follower. So i say to you as i say to myself. Do not label yourself with these religious labels that men have created. Consider yourself, simply, a Follower. A  Follower of Jesus Christ. I have created this little quote that i follow, "Let Jesus lead your heart, and you? Follow your heart. Therefore by following your heart, you are following Jesus." I do not ask Jesus into my heart as my lord and savior SIMPLY because you go to heaven if you do or hell if you don't. I have asked Jesus into my heart because i believe that i NEED his help. And well... i believe that if Jesus is not in your heart, then he is not a part of you. And therefore him not being a part of you, how is he going to help you? So i ask him into my heart because i believe i need his help, and the only way i am going to get his help is if he is apart of me. So i asked him in. Another quote i made for myself to make things a bit clearer is.. "Let Jesus propell your dreams through your soul like a 'Fire in your Eyes' and let your dreams propell you through life like a rainbow over the clouds." Yea it might sound a little cheezy to alot of people or most, i dont know. But i dont really care much about how other people interpret it. All that really matters is that it makes perfect sense to me personaly. So if you have read the bible, don't try to do what Jesus did. Why? Because Jesus has no sin, and we do. Therefore it is impossible for us to do what Jesus does!! See my point? However you can learn from the mistakes of the people mentioned in the bible, and you can learn to not repeat those mistakes. Or try not to. Well i hope i helped clearify your thoughts a little bit. God bless ya|`|HCoEupx9aa	Catholicism sadly is a false religion that has been perverted by philosophy and the self-righteousness of men.

There are people who adhere to non-theistic religions, and of course there are people who do believe in the existence of deity but do not consider themselves religious.  Again, atheism means "no belief in deity", NOT "no religion".<br>  <br>  And I see some people who said "agnostic", but that's incorrect too.  Agnosticism is the assertive belief that the existence of deity is ultimately unknown and unknowable.  Some people are agnostic atheists, some people are agnostic theists.

ZZ4tkytYaa	If you want everyone to be just like you and automatically understand who you are, then you are grasping at thin air.  stop dwelling on the past and don't let it control you. simple as that.
EYqTV2EYaa	Well, first of all, I believe you're making a big deal over nothing because you should not care TOO much of how you're perceived. Merely realize people are different and are haters sometimes. Some people feel badly about themselves and misery loves company. Some people are also the bully type and they would stop at nothing to see you feeling down so they can dominate. Check this out, when you're in a 'down' state, you're socially weak and vulnerable. Therefore, people with more social power would perceive you as a weakling they can easy bully, show-off their social skills in a negative fashion by intimating you with their 'social aggression' (as it would appear to a weaker person) and take advantage of you. I felt this before in elementary school before I got out of special classes. The  students with behavior disorders would pick on me, and because I had no social skills at the time, I could do nothing really. Now however, I feel great about myself and my social skills are off the charts. lol. I bet if they knew me now, they'd hate me. Therefore, because you're weak when you're down, you're easy-pickings, however, if you stand strong and confident, it's hard for people to dominate you because during that state, you naturally would not let them, so they hate it, and they try everything their arsenal to bring you down again to pick on you. I know it may sound extreme, but it's more common than you think, especially with females. As for advice, do not change your personality to get vengeance or even worry about it. If you know you're cool, flaunt it, and walk with a swagger when you go around them. Switch your αss when you walk. lol. Kidding, but seriously, be cool and if people don't like it, tell them to ?uck off.

I am a college student who has been looking for a job for over six months. I have tried looking for student jobs. It seems that nobody is hiring. Just stay strong and don't lose confidence in yourself. Try reaching out to all of your friends, family, and acquaintances to see if they have heard of anybody hiring. Try using Facebook, Myspace, or Craigslist to network and see if anybody is hiring. It may seem childish but you could hang fliers around your community, school, and businesses (that you frequent that have bulletin boards for things just like this) for babysitting, dog walking, house cleaning, or any other odd jobs. Just make sure you are safe and ask anybody that hires you for a list of references. Your flyers could also say what desirable skills  you have that you could possibly teach other people. And since you are in college you could print these flyers up in small quantities in different buildings for free. Just don't compromise yourself by taking jobs that sexually put you in an undesirable position. A good way to get several applications in is to apply online. Almost all businesses these days have a way to turn in applications online. Just put in as many as you possibly can to businesses around you. Set a personal goal for yourself to put in 5-10 applications a day. Even at 5 a day that's 35 applications a week. Just get yourself out there. You might not be able to get a job that you are absolutely crazy about but regardless a job is a job. Just make sure that you follow you up any interviews you have with a call to say thanks for the opportunity. Good luck to you.
uLYlQMs3aa	Yes. It was horribly warped. The start of Modern christianity was Simon the Sorcerer. High Priest of the Babylonian Pagan religion. It was he who appropriated the name Christ and gave rise to the Catholic Church and the branch offs of it including Protestant beliefs.

On the other hand, as the HRE moved into Western and Northern Europe, and onto the British Isles, it too was influenced by the pagans.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Yes, absolutely, except for trinity; that is another fable invented by overseers seeking recognition.|`|b63saJCqaa	no|`|hzMpdFFBaa	Early Christianity was a spiritual trend that developed and had intermingling ideas and ideals with mysticial Essene Judaism, proto-Christian and pagan Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Magianism, and Neoplatonism.  After a few centuries, a politician decided to make his brand of Christianity the State religion and began to outlaw other forms of spirituality and religious worship.  Elements from paganism and Christianity were closely tied together for centuries and in converting conquered peoples to Christianity, Christian ideas had to be merged or syncretized with familiar pagan ideas of the conquered--this occurred in the Old World and New World. The idea of the trinity was interpreted to be within the Bible. It also goes back to traditions within mystical Judaism and Greek philosophical thought--which strongly influenced the development of Christianity. Certain ideas within Protestantism apply "presentism" to scripture--meaning, they don't understand or interpret it in its historical or original idealogical context but in how ideas are interpreted according to modern standards and expectations.|`|yqKlmaD1aa	Nothing is created in a vacuum.  Christianity contains with in it peices of its contemporary cults (baptism, communion, "Lord of Lords", "King of Kings", universal salvation, son of god, all of these are concepts found in various mystery cults arising in the 2 hundred year period before and after the birth of Christ.<br>  <br>  When it comes to Rome, just look at Constantine.  A life long worshiper of Sol Invictus who only converted to Christianity on his death bed, a believer in ecumenicism, head of the state cult of Rome, co-issued the Edict of Milan which made religious equality the law of the land.  It was only after his death that his successors made Christianity the state religion.  This was undone by Emp. Julian, though he died a few years into his reign.|`|ephBKMthaa	Roman Catholicism was undoubtedly influenced by paganism.  Warped?  Don't think so, but clearly an amalgamation of early christian ethics and pagan traditions, The church wanted / needed new recruits.  That's why Christmas is around the time of the winter equinox, when the pagans had many celebrations.|`|vM9CxOKKaa	Yes most definitely.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Same situation.  Our good friend has a friend he takes pity on.  The guy is horrible.  So sexist and outrageously rude towards women that none of the women will come over at all.  My husband and I just say "John I'd love to come over tonight.  You gonna be there?"  He says yes.  We say something like "Wow it's rare to get you alone--where is everybody?"  He says "Oh no Joe will be here too"  We say "I'm sorry I have other plans for tonight but I'd love to get up with you.  Perhaps later in the week"<br>  <br>  After about the 5th or 6th time he got the picture and just started saying "Yeah come over but Joe will be here" or "He isn't here tonight".  Once he asked why I didn't like him so I told him it was b/c he is so offensive (in multiple ways).<br>  <br>  Just express that you have something you'd like to tell him and really need to get him alone sometime.<br>  <br>  I agree--no point in wasting your time hanging out with a person you hate.  That cliche "any friend of my friend is a friend of mine" is just a lie.|`|KWhKwgsSaa	When I was in high school, I had two best friends -- and they could not stand each other.  They never told me, I could just tell.  So, I made a point of hanging out with them separately.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend in a straightforward way that you just don't like this guy.  You don't have to go into detail, but explain that you would appreciate hanging out with your friend without the other guy present.  Be prepared though because your friend may not quite know how to handle the situation.  Be patient.  And if need be, invite your friend to hang out with you instead of going over to his house.  <br>  <br>  Hope it works out.<br>  <br>  Oh -- BTW, a few years ago I attended my 35th high school reunion.  Both of my friends were there -- they still don't like each other, so I spent time with each separately.|`|hPj1UJ8Raa	Just tell him that you really don't like him as a company NICELY. You don't have to fight him. This is the only thing that baffles me though: Why do you hate him? Is it because, you always see him and that troubles you a lot? Think about it. But well, you two might get along and maybe if you had a problem, he can be the only one that can help. Think about it dude. Good luck!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you should be able to talk openly to your friend about why you don't like the other person. That's what friends do.<br>  I had a friend and she couldn't stand my other friend but I get on well with most people, but had to have separate "friend time" with each one.|`|RpR3MkH2aa	Take your friend a side and just tell him that you would rather not be around this other guy.By not saying anything you are just going to have this keep going on.If he really is a friend he will respect your feeling about this other guy.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Just admit to your friend that you don't enjoy being in the company of that person.<br>  Usually they understand.
bglr4m0Naa	Pray for a husband and then take the steps that you need to get to find one.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	You don't seem to read the Bible to find out what it says about sex vs what the preachers say... even those in the closet like Ted Haggard who was the Fundie Evangelical adviser to President Bush!<br>  <br>  Hardly any Christian knows the story of Leah… Leah is an ancestor of Jesus. She is also one of the alleged Matriarchs of the Israelites. Jacob* (*Israel) was a polygamist. Jesus comes from a line of polygamist forbears. Leah paid in DRUGS to her own sister Rachel to buy some SEXUAL FAVOR from her negligent husband Jacob. Jacob and Leah became ancestors of Jesus in the first ever recorded DRUGS FOR SEX DEAL in the Bible!!! All under God’s approval, supervision, inspiration and leading of God the Holy Ghost! The real funny bottom line is that Jacob was married to BOTH SISTERS and they seemed to buy a night in bed with him paying each other in drugs AND DOING DRUGS ALL IN JACOB’S FAMILY, INCLUDING THEIR CHILDREN!!! I am not saying that the Jacob’s family was a bunch of junkies, OK? So don’t report me… please!!! They were all HOLY PEOPLE OF GOD…!!! The dishonest Bible schooled preachers that you pay your tithes to won’t tell you all the Bible facts! They don’t want to compromise their source of income!<br>  <br>  Marrying girls of the same family is common place in Bible stories! King David is also an ancestor of God the Son Jesus Christ. Among his many wives he was married to Michal and God personally added her mom to his collection of wives! In this particular case King David had no choice at all! Christians don’t teach all these plain Bible facts to kids in Sunday School today otherwise we would be allowed all kinds of agreeable options in our families, including but not limited to same sex marriages! Can you imagine a Holy threesome of King David, Michal and her mother in bed at the same time to keep it all in the family? In the New Testament “SPIRIT FILLED” Church at Corinth, Greece a young man was having sex with his own mother and THE WHOLE CHURCH WAS VERY PROUD OF IT! (1 Cor 5:1-2) Saint Paul didn’t condemn the mother for having sex with her son at all. Saint Paul reprimanded ONLY the son who was probably still a teenager!!! How kinky can you possibly get in the Bible stories, especially in the New Testament where it really counts for Christians today? Amazingly, we have this SEX for DRUGS deal in the Bible that NO PRUDE PREACHER WANTS TO TALK ABOUT!!! (But it is only today… if Christianity is to survive for a while longer, a lot of preachers will soon be making a living out of regulating same sex marriages, abortions, and so on… In the Catholic religion it only takes a Papal pronouncement to make anything legal!) <br>  <br>  Genesis 30:15-16 (NIV) But she said to her, “Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too?” “Very well,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes.”* (*Check, “mandrake” in Wikipedia! It is a hallucinogenic drug plant. Leah’s son was obviously a very knowledgeable teenager! There were no Public Schools in those days, but he knew how and where to get drugs already!) So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. “You must sleep with me,” she said. “I have hired you with my son's mandrakes.” SO HE SLEPT WITH HER THAT NIGHT.<br>  <br>  They probably had plenty of “mandrakes” to go around that night, too…! Surely Rachel didn’t keep all the mandrakes for herself. Rachel turned out to be quite a horny dominatrix, too! Not even Hustler magazine would publish any Bible stories promoting the use of drugs for sex! They declined to hire me! The morality of most of these erotic publications today is commendable! It is the Bible that ought to be censored!!! When Rachel moved away from her father’s home she stole all her parents’ dildos…!!! According to the Bible writers, dildos were common place in those days especially in big polygamistically oriented families like King Solomon’s. He had over 1,000 wives and lovers to please sexually! Mainly because of his wisdom in sexually handling women the Bible writers had God recognizing him as the “WISEST MAN EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH!” (1 Kin 2:12) Not even Jesus Christ was that wise handling girls! For over 300 Bible years the Temple of Solomon was a shrine of male and female prostitutes servicing God’s Chosen People! (2 Kin 23:7) God NEVER objected until a prude King Josiah objected in desperation and the Jews ended up in slavery again anyway! <br>  <br>  Genesis 31:19, 34-35 (NIV) When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods* (*dildos in the form of idols). [34-35] Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle* (*I am not sure if this is a colloquial for something else!) and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period."* (*she was probably very juicy already!) So he searched but could not find the household gods.* (*funny, because the law of God about staying away from a woman having a period was not even in effect yet, but the Bible writers made it look like it was! So what the heck!) <br>  <br>  Ezekiel 16:17 (NIV) You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols* (*DILDOS) and engaged in prostitution with them.<br>  <br>  Prostitution is not a significant “sin” at all if practiced to favor God’s Holy causes! Rahab was a professional Prostitute who committed high treason against her own country! She lied to her country’s police to protect God's people who came to spend the night with her. She made it into the Faithful Hall of Fame! Hallelujah… Praise the LORD…!!! She will preserve her title of a RIGHTEOUS PROSTITUTE for eternity!!! It’s all in the Bible! Christian American soldiers ought to be encouraged to meet in bed with AlQaida prostitutes to find out where Bin Laden is located!!! It’s all in the Bible!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 11:31 (KJV) By faith the PROSTITUTE* (*not ex-prostitute, but Prostitute!) Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient (Male and female Prostitutes are known to be very kind to Christian preachers, too like Jimmy Swaggart, Ted Haggard, and so on! It is all in the Bible!!!).<br>  <br>  James 2:25 (KJV) In the same way, was not even Rahab the PROSTITUTE* (*not the ex-prostitute, but the prostitute!) considered RIGHTEOUS for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction (Joshua 2:1-3, 6:17-25).<br>   <br>  So as long as you lie or even commit treason against your own country like the Holy and RIGHTEOUS Prostitute Rahab did to further God’s cause it is OK no matter who you are or what you do for a living! The idea that a prostitute REPENTS of her sins and wishes to forget her past “sinful” life is not applicable in every case! Rahab the Prostitute must have cried for God all that night long when the Jewish spies came all over her AND SHE WAS SAVED! She will have a happy reunion someday in Heaven again with the Jewish spies and most likely she will have a monument erected in the New Jerusalem in Heaven to celebrate her exploits! God the Son Jesus Christ said so!<br>  <br>  Matthew 21:31b (KJV) Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and THE PROSTITUTES* (*not ex-prostitutes, but PROSTITUTES!) are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you* (*the Jews).<br>  <br>  The Jews don't mind at all as long as they are there when they get there! Today, most Preachers follow a prudish restrictive Puritan morality only because they feel that most Christians in America go for it, but what they do in the closet is known only when they get caught! So if you have a choice to favor a prostitute or a Jew, which one would you choose??? Hint: WWJD??<br>  <br>  The Bible people were doing the kinkiest drugs and sex all along in the Bible stories. From inhaling the smoke of “burning bushes” to doing some mushroom specialties as depicted by the mushroom shaped bonnets worn by the High Priests of God’s Holy Temple of Solomon!  God prescribed hard liquor offerings to be poured on the altar of the LORD, too (Num 28:7).  No wonder the Bible God is so psychedelically oriented. The theologians today go crazy trying to figure out what is that the wanking Bible writers try to say and that is why we have so many brands of the Christian faith! The Temple of Solomon was also indwelled by God’s own presence (the Shikainah Glory).  For at least the first 300 Bible years since it was inaugurated until the days of the homophobic King Josiah… (another fairytale king, but what the heck!) the Temple of The LORD was housing shrines for the choicest male and female prostitutes in Israel. It must have been a pride in anybody’s family to raise a child to become a dedicated prostitute in God’s Temple! <br>  <br>  2 kings 23:7 (NIV) He* (*King Josiah) also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes* (*male shrine prostitutes were homosexuals servicing God's people in a way that Christians wouldn't approve today!), which were in the temple of the LORD…<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made the Temple of Solomon, aka The Temple of the LORD the ONLY authorized place of worship in Israel!  Can you imagine the most conservative clergypersons, preachers and their families and children going to worship God in the Temple of the LORD while at the same time male, female, gays and other bizarre prostitutes are servicing the rest of the congregation??? It is all in the Bible…  It puts to real shame any Pagan place of worship! (1 Cor 5:1-2) Like the old time spiritual goes…<br>  <br>  "?? Those were the days…???, my friend...???"|`|n55igpCUaa	Ugh...<br>  <br>  You don't need to be married to be righteous. That's societal pressure.|`|3WzGf8tJaa	Pray that God's will be done.  I know that this point of view is not very popular right now, but make a decision for celibacy.  It won't be easy, especially with all the societal pressure for having sex.

With stds, herpes, and HPV rampant in our society today, it is far safer to practice abstinence while you wait for the mate that God has chosen for you.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Being a good person has nothing what so ever to do with whether or not you have sexual relations outside of marriage.

What it boils down to is this.. several members of that family have law degrees, they go about using the name of Christ and or God to incite people to be violent against them or to "discriminate" against allowing them to protest, so that they can attempt to lodge legal action against individuals and city governments. It is basically an attempt to use religion to allow them to file lawsuits to get money.

We can't even say that it's just electrical impulses in our brain, unless we first nail down what traits or behaviours we're talking about.|`|vSlG3ayiaa	Yes, the evidence of our introspection is sufficient to establish that we have a soul.

But mental properties are only open to first person observation.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	first you need to define what a soul is.

When doctors have been forced to remove a piece of the brain in surgery, the recipient will also lose a part of themselves, anything from memories to abilities to perceptions to emotions to personality (the core parts of our individuality or "soul").<br>  <br>  Ergo, if the soul is really an independent entity, then removing part of the brain should not result in the loss of part of one's persona.<br>  <br>  In fact, in some cases a piece of the brain has been removed which moderates social behaviour, resulting in a person who is essentially without any moral conscience.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	no evidence whatsoever<br>  <br>  Investigations are currently underway into the possibility of projecting one's consciousness beyond the body, for example in so-called "near death experiences" (see the AWARE Project being operated from the University of Southampton, UK).

I tend to be very quiet and never approach people because I worry that they don't want me to. Apparently, though, I look sort of mean or unpleasant due to this. A guy I went to high school with recently told me that he was afraid to talk to me then, because I seemed too intimidating. I laughed and said that wasn't it at all, I was intimidated by everyone else!! So I think that's definitely a possibility. No one wants to get rejected, and sometimes people think we're quiet because we don't want to talk to anyone, not because we're shy, so it puts them off. Hard for me to get around it, really.

The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God, yet we do not speak of three Gods, but only one God. They have the same nature, substance, and being.<br>  <br>  Even though the Three Persons are One God, yet they are distinct: for the Father has no origin, He came from no one. But the Son is begotten, He comes from the Father alone. The Holy Spirit comes or proceeds from both the Father and the Son. These different relations of origin tell us there are three distinct Persons, who have one and the same divine nature.<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit makes holy the souls of the just by His presence. But a Spirit is not present in the sense of taking up space. We say a Spirit is present wherever it causes an effect. In the soul, the Holy Spirit transforms it, making it basically capable of taking in, after death, the infinite streams of knowledge and love that flow within the Holy Trinity. Thus we are really "sharers in the divine nature" <br>  He comes with his Seven Gifts. These make the soul capable of taking in the special lights and inspirations He sends in a much higher way than what is had in ordinary graces. We do not notice much of any effects from these Gifts until we have advanced rather far in the spiritual life, for great docility and purity of heart are needed.<br>  <br>  So we speak of the Father especially as the power of creation, of the Son as the wisdom of the Father, of the Holy Spirit as goodness and sanctification.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	It does not exist.This identity of Jesus Christ as Immanuel did not mean he was the incarnation of God, ‘God in the flesh,’ which proponents of the Trinity teaching claim is implied by the meaning of Immanuel, namely, “With Us Is God.” It was a common practice among Jews to embody the word “God,” even “Jehovah,” in Hebrew names. Even today Immanuel is the proper name of many men; none of whom are incarnations of God.<br>  <br>  If there seems to be a conflict between the angel’s instructions to Mary (“you are to call his name Jesus”) and Isaiah’s prophecy (“she will certainly call his name Immanuel”), let it be remembered that Messiah was also to be called by yet other names. (Lu 1:31; Isa 7:14) For example, Isaiah 9:6 said concerning this one: “His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” Yet none of these names were given to Mary’s firstborn as personal names, neither when he was a babe nor after he took up his ministry.

It is a teen romance novel following the story of a young girl who returns to her hometown in search of a selkie she encountered seven years earlier.<br>  <br>  In science-fiction the Petaybee Series by Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough employs the selkie myth in a futuristic setting. A.

In the book, selkies performed commando-style beach infiltrations highly reminiscent of how SEALs are often portrayed in popular media.<br>  <br>  The book Water Shaper by Laura Williams McCaffrey is based on some myths about selkies.<br>  <br>  British fantasy author Susan Cooper has written both a picture book and a novel featuring selkies. The picture book, Selkie Girl, recounts a traditional selkie legend from Ireland. The novel, Seaward, features characters who turn out to be selkies.<br>  <br>  In the first Meredith Gentry novel, A Kiss of Shadows, by Laurell K. Hamilton, a selkie named Roane Finn is the lover of Merry Gentry, who is a part human part fey princess who is hiding in Los Angeles in self-imposed exile from the Unseelie Kingdom due to political plots against her. Merry and Roane are both paranormal detectives working for the Grey Detective Agency. Roane had been trapped in human form when a fisherman had found his seal skin and burned it. When the latent magic in Merry is awakened, it first manifests itself by miraculously regenerating Roane's shapeshifting ability. He immediately returns to his life in the sea for which he had been pining.<br>  <br>  George Mackay Brown's novel Beside the Ocean of Time also involves a young man falling love with a Selkie, and the hiding of her sealskin to keep her from returning to the sea.<br>  <br>  In Tom Clancy's 1998 novel Net Force, a female assassin uses the name "The Selkie" as her underground cover name. In the novel, she is of Irish heritage.<br>  <br>  In 1998, American author Christina Dodd published a romance novel entitled A Well Favored Gentleman about Ian Fairchild. His character made his first appearance in the first book of the Well Pleasured series, A Well Pleasured Lady (1997). Ian is the son of a selkie and has powers due to that legacy.<br>  <br>  In Anne Bishop's Tir Alainne trilogy selkies are a member of the Fae race who must help witches avoid the mass murdering black inquisitors in order to stay alive.<br>  <br>  Juliet Marillier wrote several trilogies, mixing folklore with history. In Child of the Prophecy (2001) Darragh is turned into a selkie by the Fae, while Watcher in Foxmask (2003) is a descendant of a selkie mother and a human father.<br>  <br>  Mollie Hunter's novel, A Stranger Came Ashore, has a character who turns out to be the Great Selkie, lord of all the other selkies.<br>  <br>  Robert Holdstock's novel Merlin's Wood, contains a fantasy short story, The Silvering, in which the human protagonist is transformed into a selkie.<br>  <br>  In J.K. Rowling's book Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them it is stated that the Loch Ness Monster is in fact the world's largest selkie, and prefers the form of a sea serpent. In the past, the gamekeeper of Hogwarts, Hagrid offered the use of the school's lake to house the monster.<br>  <br>  James A. Hetley's books, Dragon's Eye and Dragon's Teeth, have a family of characters with the hereditary ability to transform into seals.<br>  <br>  The Torchwood comic Captain Jack and the Selkie features a Selkie.

ij5Sv6staa	If their God does not believe in Jesus, his own Son, then Allah of Islam is different than the God of Christianity.<br>  <br>  I believe Islam is a counterfeit religion meant to distract from the only way of salvation--Jesus Christ, Son of God.  Mohammad is a false prophet because Islam does not accept that Jesus is the son of God.  Islam teaches that Jesus was only a great prophet and not the Son of God, but Jesus must be the son of God, here is the reasoning:<br>  <br>  1) either Jesus is who he says he is, the Son of God, and Islam is wrong.<br>  or<br>  2) Jesus was a raving lunatic. For no great prophet of God would also blaspheme God by declaring himself the Son of God.  Jesus cannot be a great prophet as Islam says and a great liar at the same time!!!<br>  <br>  We KNOW Mohammad is a false prophet because he denies Jesus is the son of God, here is the test:<br>  1 John 4:1-3<br>  1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:13-15<br>  13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus himself declared before multiple witnesses that he is the son of God (Jesus cannot be a great prophet if he also blasphemes God):<br>  <br>  Matthew 26:63-64 <br>   63But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ,[a] the Son of God." 64"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  <br>  Mark 14:61-62 <br>  61But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ,[a] the Son of the Blessed One?" 62"I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."<br>  <br>  Luke 22:70<br>  70They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?"  He replied, "You are right in saying I am."<br>  <br>  John 4:25-26<br>  The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us." Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."<br>  <br>  John 10:25-30 <br>  25Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, 26but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. 27My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 28I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. 29My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all[d]; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. 30I and the Father are one." <br>  <br>  John 17:1-5 <br>  After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him. Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent. I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.|`|FrnMCNHoaa	Yes that's what they believe. It is just the Arabic equivalent of the term: "God".

d39bc6ed410ac0f40593afdcca23d8e3aa	there are only two possible explanations as to how our existence came to be.  Either we had a beginning or we did not have a beginning.  The Bible says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1 :1).  Most atheists maintain that there was no beginning.  The idea is that matter has always existed in the form of either matter or energy; and all that has happened is that matter has been changed from form to form, but it has always been.  The Humanist Manifesto says, "Matter is self-existing and not created," and that is a concise statement of the atheist's belief. <br>  <br>      The way we decide whether the atheist is correct or not is to see what science has discovered about this question.  The picture below on the left represents our part of the cosmos.  Each of the disk shaped objects is a galaxy like our Milky Way.  All of these galaxies are moving relative to each other.  Their movement has a very distinct pattern which causes the distance between the galaxies to get greater with every passing day.  If we had three galaxies located at positions A, B. and C in the second diagram below, and if they are located as shown, tomorrow they will be further apart.  The triangle they form will be bigger.  The day after tomorrow the triangle will be bigger yet.  We live in an expanding universe that gets bigger and bigger and bigger with every passing day. <br>  <br>  Now let us suppose that we made time run backwards!   If we are located at a certain distance today, then yesterday we were closer together.  The day before that, we were still closer.  Ultimately, where must all the galaxies have been?  At a point!  At the beginning!  At what scientists call a singularity!  In 1999, it was discovered that the galaxies are accelerating in their expansion.  Any notion that we live in an oscillating or pulsating universe has been dispelled by this discovery.  The universe is not slowing down, but speeding up in its motion.<br>  <br>  A second proof is seen in the energy sources that fuel the cosmos.  The picture to the right is a picture of the sun.  Like all stars, the sun generates its energy by a nuclear process known as thermonuclear fusion.  Every second that passes, the sun  compresses 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium with 4 million tons of matter released as energy.  In spite of that tremendous consumption of fuel, the sun has only used up 2% of the hydrogen it had the day it came into existence.  This incredible furnace is not a process confined to the sun.  Every star in the sky generates its energy in the same way.  Throughout the cosmos there are 25 quintillion stars, each converting hydrogen into helium, thereby reducing the total amount of hydrogen in the cosmos.  Just think about it!  If everywhere in the cosmos hydrogen is being consumed and if the process has been going on forever, how much hydrogen should be left? <br>  <br>  Suppose I attempt to drive my automobile without putting any more gas (fuel) into it.  As I drive and drive, what is eventually going to happen?  I am going to run out of gas!  If the cosmos has been here forever, we would have run out of hydrogen long ago!  The fact is, however, that the sun still has 98% of its original hydrogen.  The fact is that hydrogen is the most abundant material in the universe!  Everywhere we look in space we can see the hydrogen 21-cm line in the spectrum--a piece of light only given off by hydrogen.  This could not be unless we had a beginning! <br>  <br>  A third scientific proof that the atheist is wrong is seen in the second law of thermodynamics.  In any closed system, things tend to become disordered.  If an automobile is driven for years and years without repair, for example, it will become so disordered that it would not run any more.  Getting old is simple conformity to the second law of thermodynamics.  In space, things also get old.  Astronomers refer to the aging process as heat death.  If the cosmos is "everything that ever was or is or ever will be," as Dr. Carl Sagan was so fond of saying, nothing could be added to it to improve its order or repair it.  Even a universe that expands and collapses and expands again forever would die because it would lose light and heat each time it expanded and rebounded. <br>  <br>  The atheist's assertion that matter/energy is eternal is scientifically wrong.  The biblical assertion that there was a beginning is scientifically correct. <br>  <br>  THE CAUSE<br>  <br>  If we know the creation has a beginning, we are faced with another logical question--was the creation caused or was it not caused?  The Bible states, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."  Not only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause (a creation) but it also tells us what the cause was.  It was God. The atheist tells us that "matter is self-existing and not created."  If matter had a beginning and yet was uncaused, one must logically maintain that something would have had to come into existence out of nothing.  From empty s|`|AsQ0hwEdaa	Hebrews 11:3 - "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear."<br>  The whole creation is proof that God exists. And he's also manifested himself in History. In Moses' days when he sent the plagues in Egypt.<br>  <br>  But people usually don't like to believe in it because it demands from them a correction of lifestyle. People are willing to accept theories and other History books, but they don't want to believe the Bible as History unless they see things with their eyes happening in front of them.<br>  <br>  If God manifested himself to the world today, it's just a matter of a few hundreds of years for people to forget about him and treat Him as myth again.

oDdXpghDaa	Lydia goes to Brighton because the commander of the militia is friends with her father and invites her along to come with - which breaks Kitty's heart because the two are inseperable.  That's where Wickham elopes with Lydia.  <br>  <br>  ********<br>  <br>  After the reception of the letter, the novel contrives to separate Darcy and Elizabeth, giving each of them space in which to adjust their feelings and behavior. In the meantime, Austen lays the groundwork for Lydia's whirlwind romance with Wickham and establishes a contrast between Elizabeth's maturity concerning Darcy and Lydia's girlish imprudence. Whereas Elizabeth assumes a passive stance in matters of love, consenting to go to Pemberley only because she thinks Darcy will not be there, Lydia actively pursues her beloved officers and stakes her claim to Wickham now that he has lost interest in Miss King: “I will answer for it that he never cared three straws for her.”<br>   <br>  That Mr. Bennet is unaware of Lydia's infatuation with the officer and permits her to follow the militia to Brighton reminds us of his irresponsible detachment from family life. Because of their decision not to expose Wickham, Jane and Elizabeth are also partly responsible for Lydia's imminent romance. Darcy maintains a similar silence about Wickham's past, which brings him into the beginnings of an alignment with Elizabeth.|`|aIhhDqOWaa	I just had to comment on this, as I just saw on amazon a book called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies....Seriously, it's like 85% original novel and 15% zombies...|`|DbxOLpddaa	?????confused

Read the Biblie, but this time with a little more attention. God created everything good.

Since they were the prototypes of all Men, all Men have inherited the perverted separation from God which is consequent on their sin. This separation from God consists in an inclination to evil, immorality and selfishness. Its consequence is a subordination of the reason and will to the passion and emotion and a rebellion against authority.|`|AQBow7Glaa	The doctrine of original sin, along with the idea that unbaptized babies go to hell, wasn't generally accepted among Christians until after the council of Orange in the 5th century A.D.

We are all born with a sin nature which was passed on from Adam. Another way of expressing this would be to say that we are all sinners and we all have sin in our flesh.

When the Lord first created Adam and Eve, they were created with eternal life however it all changed when sin entered into their flesh and from that moment they slowly began to die (eventually from old age).

He has committed adultery and nothing he can do can make it right if he does not reconcile himself to his wife or live single.  He can be forgiven for cheating but can't for continuing to sin.  We must repent of sin and that means to turn from it, living with someone and marrying them is not repenting.  God is clear, as long as he lives he is married to his first wife or as long as she lives.  The wife however is free to remarry since he broke the covenant.  Your friend needs to read 1 Corinthians 6:9.  It says adulterers will not inherit the Kingdom of God, this means if you die in adultery (not stop/repent) then you will not make it.  Any sin can be forgiven if repented of, except blaspheming the Holy Spirit.|`|DPI2n3nOaa	it is one of the biggest sin and that which god really hates... <br>  but even then he is most merciful... !

They were worried that they would not get converts without a "god" to worship and pay membership fees to in the way of offerings and alms. To solve this dilemma, they took the next logical step and deified the founder. Problem solved.|`|IgztWp0uaa	Sure.

You can make up your own mind on whether one exists or not.<br>  <br>  "Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it.<br>  Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumoured by many.<br>  Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books.<br>  Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders.<br>  Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.<br>  But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason, and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br>  <br>  -Buddha|`|motz4Y14aa	Buddha said it simple and clear, there is no god that helps.

Only he didn't think they were important to be enlightened.<br>  The Buddha believed only men are able to get enlightened because they are free enough (unlike animals) but not so happy as not wanting to invest in change (unlike the gods).<br>  <br>  The Buddha wasn't keen on dogma's so of course you are free to believe they exist or not.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	Mawkish is quite right.  What I have to say is really just a piggy-back on what he wrote. <br>  <br>  There are many suttas that deal with conversations between the Buddha or his disciples and various deities. For example:<br>  <br>  1) The opening collection of the Samyutta Nikaya is a collection of conversations in verse form between the Buddha and various devas (gods, or celestial beings).<br>  <br>  2) In the Majjhima Nikaya, Ven. Maha Mogallana enters the heavenly realm to visit a former disciple of the Buddha who was reborn as a god (Brahma).  Maha Mogallana gave him a lesson he wouldn't soon forget, replete with miracles.<br>  <br>  3) In the Digha Nikaya, the Buddha himself cleared up some philosophical questions with a Brahma (I want to say it was Sakka, but I can't be sure of the name. I'm doing this from memory and don't have the texts at my disposal right now).<br>  <br>  4) The Buddha very clearly taught in the Maha and Culakammavibhanga Suttas (if I remember the names correctly--the English translation is Greater and Lesser Discorses on Kamma) in the Majjhima Nikaya show the Buddha as saying that for one who has lived a life in accordance with the precepts, mindfully, and aware, that at the breakup of the body, they can be reborn in the various heavenly realms, as gods, devas, etc. He also taught the converse--rebirth in hell. (1)<br>  <br>  5) The Buddha also taught in the Majjhima Nikaya that to deny the existence of the other world is wrong view: ""Because there actually is the next world, the view of one who thinks, 'There is no next world' is his wrong view. Because there actually is the next world, when he is resolved that 'There is no next world,' that is his wrong resolve. Because there actually is the next world, when he speaks the statement, 'There is no next world,' that is his wrong speech. Because there actually is the next world, when he is says that 'There is no next world,' he makes himself an opponent to those arahants who know the next world. Because there actually is the next world, when he persuades another that 'There is no next world,' that is persuasion in what is not true Dhamma. And in that persuasion in what is not true Dhamma, he exalts himself and disparages others. Whatever good habituation he previously had is abandoned, while bad habituation is manifested. And this wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, opposition to the arahants, persuasion in what is not true Dhamma, exaltation of self, & disparagement of others: These many evil, unskillful activities come into play, in dependence on wrong view." (2)<br>  <br>  Majjhima Nikaya 60

Larc en Ciel taught me a lot. Anime uses a lot of "put downs" and slang, but you can learn it... Just write down words or phrases that catch your attention and then look them up. If you can't find the translation, just ask on here. There's so many people that can help you.|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	It wouldn't be affective, because you'd only learn the words and phrases common to the genre.  If you watched a dubbed version, and were good at picking up contextive clues and recognizing patterns, you might learn a few words here and there.  Take some classes in school, or buy Rosetta Stone.|`|e9ppRrkMaa	I've watched anime for years, the closest I've gotton is knowing the suffixes like -san -chan, and -sama so it won't really help =/

FP5MsZ7iaa	Hi, I'm not Austronesian myself by I live in Indonesia. Most Indonesians, like Filipinos speak Austronesian languages but they might not even know it. But most of them do not live in tribal system. But some exceptions like, for example in Indonesia, the Dayak of Borneo, Anak suku dalam (Jambi, Sumatra), For Philippines, The Batak and Tak Banua (Palawan). At least these are some of the groups I met as an anthropologist. Greetings
8FbJjRpwaa	aww sister I read once if you read surah yusuf then it makes you prettier =)<br>  p.s just pray to become prettier maybe you will..if your religious then you will get noor which is prettier than prettier =) if you get what i mean it makes people like you more.|`|7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	Allah has shaped the human beings as the most beautiful/prettiest of all His Creations. He has created the women as beautiful/prettier than men.  The colour and the shape bestowed on you by Allah is the best.<br>  <br>  Remember Allah by saying salats, reading Qur'an and reciting tasbeehs.  This is the best way to attain good self esteem.  You may ask for Jannah (Heaven) where you will have beauty of your choice.  Every day your beauty will increase in Heaven.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Surely you are beautiful remember being beautiful is just not about the 'physical' appearence, in fact it  lies in beautiful manners and good character.|`|vnty8yOgaa	Ya Jamilo|`|4sc7bMbkaa	surah Yusaf best dua|`|8gtVRmahaa	What how you want to be beautiful.You want inner be beauty or outer beauty.The inner beauty comes by reciting Quran and if you Hifz Quran then the noor will fall on you like rain and it is permanent.But if you want outter beauty which is temporary than there is nothing to worry dont recite Quran.There is no need of it........ just use creams.|`|41afd5e3da75fd98c329d5b575acf9a1aa	I think we all just need to be happy with what Allah (SWT) gave us and take care of our bodies, because they are a blessing. The more you pray and do good deeds, the more your iman increases, and the more noor shows on your face. Basically don't worry about your "faults", focus on the good things.|`|YnlplIOOaa	Just be a true muslim and Allah will give a glow to your face.. do your prayers, read Quran, be nice to everyone! I'm not sure about da dua but I know that if you read sura fateha and koolhoo allah 3 times then Allah will make your wish come true. X|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I don't know of any dua specifically but just simply say (even in English) "Oh Allah, make me beautiful"|`|PExIfZxxaa	Salam,<br>  If you will keep low self esteem you will not be able to face the world.So be confident.And Prayer is best way to ask Allah watever you want.|`|4j3CwEnLaa	yea she is right. yusuf was the most prettiest human ever lived.|`|xtI9RmNZaa	I think surah yousuf is best.|`|zBqt99avaa	I don't know any dua' s sorry.<br>  <br>  But, when I was younger I was convinced I was ugly.  This was mostly due to bad haircuts and because my face wasn't done maturing.  After about 15, I believed I wasn't ugly, but certainly not pretty.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I became a woman that I realized men found me attractive.  I don't think I'm some kind of beauty queen, but I'm not longer ashamed of my face.<br>  <br>  It could be the same with you.  Maybe you just need time to finish developing.  Maybe you need to change your style a little.  And don't forget, a smile goes a long way towards beautifying any face.<br>  <br>  God gave you this face, be proud of it.  Trust that He knew what He was doing when He made it. :)

Just because Green Day sucks and they don't like America doesn't mean that all Canadians are that way.|`|q9PVawNyaa	I disagree completely. I also think that you personally are probably inferior to pretty much every Canadian.<br>  <br>  Oh and no I'm not Canadian.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	I disagree. I have a Canadian friend who has never said anything bad about America. I think you're the reason why a lot of people outside the US think we're stuck up and arrogant. Stop embarrassing us.|`|hth11Uilaa	I am American, but, unlike you , I do not hold the mentality that any other race, nationality, gender, etc is "inferior". That is a ridiculous mind set... the same mind set that is the basis of so many conflicts of various levels, and also the lack of basic human compassion many people have to experience. We are ALL human beings. <br>  <br>  ALSO, thank you for being one of many who give other countries reasons to assume we all think like you.|`|JOdlqhQwaa	You can't be serious....|`|sxXoLSPxaa	this American disagrees.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Canadians love us, they just hate our politics and hate the fact that if we get nuked, they'll catch the fall-out....
GdXOjRNmaa	The Ethiopians claims to have it & only that one monk is said to be allowed in it's presence. No one, even historians & archaeologists are ever allowed to see it. I believe the Ark was lost forever when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the first Temple & brought the Israelites with them in exile. The Bible doesn't mention the Ark after this happened.|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	I believe that God took the Ark of the Covenant up to Heaven.<br>  <br>  Revelation 11:19 "And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."<br>  <br>  There is also a verse about the glory or presence of God leaving the Israelites. I believe this is also a reference to the Ark seeing as it was where God dwelt in the tabernacle. I couldn't remember where it was though.|`|d4UVprLvaa	Like an Orthodox Christian I'm not going to argue this point. I've looked at some answers above and found out:<br>  -It can't be there becuase one can't see it.<br>  -If one is an Atheiest it can't be there.<br>  -We're poor so, it can't be there.<br>  -There are replicas so it can't be there. <br>  -It can't be there.<br>  <br>  Hmmmmmm...well we DO. So deal with it !!! :op<br>  <br>  One Love !!!<br>  ---|`|YkZa3SXyaa	I dont know for sure , but there are thousands of chuches in ethiopia which contains the replica of the arc of the covenant ... why do ethiopians keep a replica of the arc of the covenant if they dont have the arc???

Simply because they exist, and they are very old (the European ones I mentioned date from the Crusades) does not mean they are authentic.<br>  <br>  The Ethiopian holy relics are the same.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	If they did have it I'd be willing to bet you a million bucks a forensic investigator could easily show the tablets were inscribed by men and not magic. <br>  Even fifty years ago the number of "authentic" relics was much higher than it is today. Investigators have been systematically revealing the ridiculousness of so called Biblical artifacts for decades, and if the Ark of the Covenant did ever show up it would be a big blow to the true believers when the first person to look at it pointed out the chisel marks in the stone.|`|tW86bOMNaa	Apparently, yes... One of my closest friends is senior in the Ethiopian Orthodox church, and for a time was responsible for the presentation of the Ark.|`|AA10014750	Absolute anser to that question; God knows, I do not.<br>  The scriptures seem to indicate is is near Jerusalem 'underground'.

You are saved once you believe, don't get discouraged-I've been there and I have total trust and confidence in God today.

God bless|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	If you still enjoy sin, then you just go back to God and ask Him to forgive you...He will take you back, if you are sincere from your heart...<br>  You can also get baptized again, but remember that when you repent, it means to turn from the sin and try not to do it again...<br>  God will forgive you...get some help locally from the pastor and try to talk to a minister who you trust...God bless<br>  You cannot continue to go forth and back , the bible says that you can only serve one master , God wants you to make up your mind...He said that if you are lukewarm, that He will spit you out...|`|sbnUAllfaa	Hi their honey, a short Dialogue that may help you.<br>  <br>  Someone has said that "Roof off,Walls down".We don't mind having the<br>  roof off because God see's through the roof anyhow, but we can get pretty uncomfortable when we let the walls down so our fellow Christians can see in. There is no greater proving ground for our christian character than close, committed fellowship with believers.<br>  <br>  We will be tested by tribulation and also by success, we must hold out<br>  through both. Praise and Thank Him in all circumstances, seek His <br>  face, be a "God Chaser".

Im not looking just to give you a quick answer and hope to get 10 points.... I would much rather talk with you via email if you are willing....my email is available.|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Satan always tries to to upset Christians. It's a bit like WW1 trench warfare in as much as if you keep your head below the trench surface you'll be pretty safe, but when you get out of your trench the enemy starts shooting at you.<br>  <br>  When you accept God and become a Christian, Satan tries to shoot you down to stop you spreading God's Word to others.<br>  <br>  If you wish to say this prayer sincerely, you will know 100% that God lives in your heart, you have recieved His gift of Salvation and it can never be taken away from you.<br>  <br>  "Dear Heavenly Father, please forgive me for the wrongs that I have done! I'm sorry, and I want to receive You into my heart through the Love of Your Son, Jesus. Help me to love You and others so that I can be happy and make others happy. Teach me more about You from Your wonderful Book, the Bible. In the name of Jesus, Your Son, amen."<br>  <br>  If you've said that prayer with sincerity and honesty, Jesus has come into your heart, because He's promised to do so! He said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if anyone will open the door I will come in and have loving fellowship with them."--Revelation 3:20. If you haven't, do it now before it's too late! God bless and keep you and make you a blessing!|`|AA11225089	If you have a sense of sin in your life, and have repented of all sin and accepted Jesus as your saviour, then the word of God says you are saved. You are right in saying you cannot trust your feelings, so trust instead in the Bible, speak out loud as many times as it takes that you are a child of God and will not be spooked out of continuing in your journey. The Bible says, 'resist the devil and he will flee from you,' this is why you must speak it out loud, so the enemy knows he is not winning and will eventually leave you alone.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	If you feel you are not saved yet and you enjoy sinning then you must go to Confession and repent until your last sin is forgiven.<br>  You will still carry on sinning afterwords but if have faith in Christ you sins are forgiven.

Satan does use this tactic on Christians to make them ineffective.  It gives us the "I'm not worthy line" so that we won't do what God has intended us to do.  The thing about sin is that it does feel good, that is the whole lure of it.  But when we are really serious about doing what God wants, those sins start to not seem so appealing.  Just remember no one is perfect and we will mess up from time to time.  Just dust yourself off and keep going.  Don't let yourself be distracted.|`|BIcwYuLBaa	yes, it is just satan lying to you, If you truly try to follow Jesus you'll be saved (or at least get in to purgatory depending on your beliefs), so every time you feel that why just ask the devil and any other spirits to leave in Jesus' name.<br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  L|`|d7417f76fabaaeaca09baa21844aa149aa	Congratulations!<br>  You are human and susceptible to doubt.<br>  That is normal.<br>  You just need to trust in your faith, love your wife, and lead a life that is true to God and yourself.<br>  <br>  With your faith, all good things will come to you.|`|cKuppxUQaa	Rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus he is a liar and a thief and wishes to take you from Jesus. My prayers are with you.|`|IFQFt25naa	We are many times our own worst enemy.  For we know all the darkness/temptations that is in us that we keep under control.<br>  <br>  Let me ask you this as something to think about:  If I (or someone) came to you telling you they had done and worry about what you are concerned about, what would you, honestly, tell them?<br>  <br>  As for the spiritual side, the ole devil is going to always be “whispering in our ears” to do things we know we shouldn’t.  And he will even make many very good and logical arguments for doing the wrong thing (tempting us).<br>  <br>  But as you should know we (as Christians) have the authority from Our Lord to tell Satan “to go take a hike”.  Not always the easiet thing to do for we are mere mortals with very human desires and emotions.   The trick is do we let the desires and emotions control us, or do we control them.<br>  <br>  However, I wouldn’t “beat myself up” for worrying about falling.  As long as you realize you can fail and realize when you have you can be forgiven and Lord will always be there with his hand out reached to help you up when you stumble.  And arms spread wide in order to hug you when you return to him.  Of course the ultimate goal is to never stumble.<br>  <br>  However, if anyone ever gets to the point that they believe they can not, do not and are never making mistakes or doing anything against God, at that point they really need to be worried.  For at that point the devil has the person “hook line and sinker” and at the same time, amazingly, has them thinking they are following God.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	the devil is going to temp you into many things and most on the things u cant resist. he knows your strenght and weakneses, to fight a blattle against him you need to really communicate with god, pray alot and tell him to take the temptations away. it not bad liking some of the things from this world just as long as u dont choose those things before god. always put god in the first place and then he will let u enjoy part of this world.|`|IvJvQi2Saa	Satan is doing everything he can to take you away from Jesus. You have to pray to Jesus when satan's trying to trick you. If you're Christian YOU'RE SAVED AND WILL GO TO HEAVEN, I PROMISE YOU.

I've gotten very lukewarm even while being a youth pastor I found myself doing the things I used too before I was saved...It's a very scary feeling!  I often wondered if I was really saved.<br>  <br>  Check this though:<br>  <br>  John 6:44, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day."<br>  <br>  Your desire is to be holy before God and no one can come to the Father unless he is called by him and yes the enemy will attack anyone who tries to make a difference for God.  I know the feeling.  You always think about what you did when you backslid but the truth is that you are saved by the blood and God will get you through it.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	As soon as they start to pull out the diaper gear, you have to speak up and ask, "Surely you don't intend to do that here."  Parents these days are very "all about me."  They expect because they manage to have a child, the world should stop and revolve around "our future."  But if the future is selfish, self-centered people, thank you but no thank you.  They've merely managed to do what any ignorant 12-year-old girl can, and should be courteous to those around them.  Stopping it before it starts is the key, and if they continue, hit the attendant call button.<br>  <br>  No doubt she is also one of those losers who change diapers in the car and leaves them in the parking lot rather than walk 10 feet to the trash.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	That is absolutely disgusting.  To the person who said "maybe she had other little ones that she couldnt leave alone..maybe she had no choice..." that is not a viable excuse.  She could have gone to the bathroom.  It is so incredibly selfish to change a diaper on a plane in a cramped area instead of going to the bathroom.  If she had other kids I think they could have handled being left alone.  She is on a plane... her kids could not have gone anywhere.  If i was in that situation I would have gotten up and found a flight attendant and told her about the situation.  I am sure they would have done something about it.  You should have been the one glaring mean looks at her.|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Start protesting as soon as you can see the intention of changing the little brat's Poppy pants.  Call the attendants.  THrow the old ****** and baby off the plane.<br>  <br>  The airlines should announce that diaper changes should be in the bathrooms.  Seems odd to me they do not do this regularly.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	They have special places in the bathroom for them to do that.  I would've complained to the stewardess right away.  That's not sanitary!|`|d5zEYomEaa	In the future, buzz the flight attendant and tell her, or go to the back of the plane and tell the attendant and let them deal with her because it's not your job to confront her. They're trained to handle these things. That is so rude, some people are just so friggin selfish and inconsiderate of others. I would've exploded and told her to stop staring or stared back, what a creepy mom. Or you should've wiped your bottom and brought it back to her to see how she feels.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	I would have got out of my seat and stood far enough away to avoid the smell.  If the flight attendant questioned my actions I would have simply pointed at the extremely rude woman.  The woman with the baby should have warned you she was about to change the child's stinky diaper right there.  I am curious, what did she do with the dirty diaper when she was done?  Did you get to enjoy that smell for the rest of the trip?|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	You should have mentioned something right away, whether to the mother, or to the attendant. If she had other kids, the attendants are used to minors flying alone, all she had to do was call one over and explain her situation. It was very disrespectful of her, and extremely unsanitary. What did she do with the nappy afterwards? Throw it under the seat?|`|MPavjXO6aa	Ask her to take it to the restroom. There are trays that fold down to change a diaper while on a plane. If she refuses, ask an attendant to make her go to the back of the plane, or to the attendant's station to change the diaper. No one has to put up with a disrepectful passenger.|`|64192d3934541ee64b034e0da99e0feaaa	This contravenes all standards of decency and shows a complete disrespect for other passengers.<br>  <br>  There are private places for nappy changing and this woman should have had the decency to use it.<br>  <br>  Whats wrong with people these days?|`|AA11198190	She should have had the decency to go to the restroom.<br>  l think this is somewhat inconsiderate......and you had the right to tell her so......|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Tell her to use the toilet or she'll be getting that diaper in her face. No one should have to put up with that.|`|AA10293687	just as you did! good job, im proud of folks like you!  :)|`|28TJbbNHaa	Next time she did that you could have offered to help the mother take her baby to the place where she can change the diapers. Usually there is a room specially reserved for that. And btw,  you should have asked if you could  move. You didn't have to put up with those mean looks if there were other seats available.|`|cXD5pt5paa	It seems she is not only rude but extremely lazy. She should have taken the time and went to the bathroom.<br>  You spent good money for your ticket, if you are ever in this spot again, I would get a stewardess to escort her to the rest room.|`|OMkcDp5Oaa	You did the right thing.

SO disgusting!|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Disgusting. I'm glad you said something. They have baby change stations in plane bathrooms. I don't know why she couldn't just use one of them.
IFQFt25naa	How much of The Bible did I Physically open and read today?  None.<br>  <br>  However there were many sections of the bible that I thought about though out the day.<br>  <br>  For instance, just to list a very few.<br>  <br>  When I was playing with my little girl (she is 2 now :-) ) and watching her do some new things for the first time TOTALLY by herself and how happy and proud she was for doing it. While watching the glow on her face.  I couldn’t help but to think about, Mat 18:10  “…  for I (Jesus) say to you, that in heaven their (little one’s/children’s) angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.”<br>  For you could almost see the glow of The Angels and Our Creator smiling as she has finally grown enough to be able to do some things she has wanted to do for so very long but was just a little to short.<br>  <br>  With some of the businesses, where some will try to cheat others with the quantities as well as quality the buyer receives.   I thought about Pro 11:1  “A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is His delight.”<br>  <br>  When I had lunch,  I thought about:<br>  James 2:14  What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man sayeth he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him? <br>  James 2:15  If a brother or sister is naked, and destitute of daily food, <br>  James 2:16  And one of you sayeth to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br>  <br>  And thanked The Lord that he has provided for me and my family.  Then asked him to help me to be able to do more for so many where I am located that are unable to have food (or a table to eat it on), to be able to help more go to school, to be able to help more have medical attention.    Just to be able to help the people here to be able to take care of themselves.    It really does break my heart to know how much needs to be done here. But at least we are trying to help where we can.  (If anyone wants to know more about what we are doing here, feel free to email me.)<br>  <br>  There are so many things though out the day that remind me of some section of the bible.  Some are very joyful, others literally bring tears to my eyes (if you had seen some of the tragedies and abominations I have seen here you would understand why; for only a soulless heartless demon would be able to witness some of these things and not have their heart break.)<br>  <br>  So while I might not physically read The Bible everyday, what it says and the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ are very close to my heart.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	proverbs 19 : 1 thur 29<br>  galatians 3 : 1 thur 15<br>  God bless you in all  the good work you do <br>  amen|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Helaman 13-16 and listened to Isaiah 45-62.<br>  <br>  Helped me how the Lord impacts our lives.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	"Thermodynamic analysis of a gamma type Stirling engine in <br>  non-ideal adiabatic conditions" <br>  <br>  it left me confused...|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Revelation 17<br>  <br>  I thank God for letting me understand.<br>  <br>  .|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	None.<br>  Just fine.<br>  Um..|`|X6ESkvsqaa	John 15:4  Abide in me, and I in you.

It is specifically an atheistic religion.  Atheism does NOT equate to not having religion.  It merely means one doesn't believe in any deities.  The word "theist" specifically relates to gods, not religion.  A "theist" is a person who believed in a god or gods.  An "atheist" is the opposite, one who doesn't believe in gods.  A "theocracy" is rulership by a god or a god's representative.  <br>  <br>  Buddhists can also easily be atheists, FYI.<br>  <br>  Wicca is a polytheistic religion.  I do not agree with atheists who also call themselves Wiccans.  It generally means they practice magic within a generally Wiccan framework.  I would call that "Wicca-influenced magic," not Wicca.  My central goal as a Wiccan is to forge a relationship with the gods.<br>  <br>  "Pagan" is a hugely problematic term because one of the dictionary definitions is "non-Judeo-Christian religion."  Satanism is pagan.  Hindus are pagan.  Wiccans and druids are pagan.  Buddhists are pagan.  Heck, Zoroastrians are commonly conisdered pagan, and they're monotheists.  There is no unifying belief among "pagans."  Ergo, you could have an atheistic pagan, although the vast majority of pagans are not atheists.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Upon her death the royal house adopted the name of her husband, Albert, which was Saxburg-Coba-Gotha.<br>  --------<br>  Using traditional conventions when Queen Elizabeth II dies, the royal house should be known by the household name of Prince Philip the Danish-German House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg . <br>  However, Philip renounced those titles in 1947 before he got married. However, after Philip renounced his Danish-German and Greek titles he adopted the surname Mountbatten.<br>  ----------<br>  Queen Elizabeth has made a formal statement that the royal house should continue to be called Windsor after her death. However, once she dies that decision could be overruled by the next sovereign. Charles, as sovereign,  could rename the royal house Mountbatten.<br>  ----------<br>  Although possible, it is considered highly unlikely. When the royal house was named Windsor in 1917 the king was more or less announcing to the world that the monarchy was divorcing itself from the ancient system of royalty, and forever associating itself with a powerful British symbol.<br>  ======<br>  It is  very possible that Charles will rule under one of his middle names, George.

zPfgFXU5aa	There are Demons who deceive humans with counterfeit spiritual experiences and these often are successful in tricking people because their victims usually have no idea about the warnings God gave us in the Bible about these counterfeit experiences.<br>  <br>  The bible therefore tells us to "test the spirits" to see if they are of God or of the Devil and it tells us to "test all things" to determine false doctrine from pure doctrine. <br>   <br>  The first Biblical test is "What do they say about Jesus?"  <br>   <br>  Satan and his demons acknowledge the historical incarnation of Jesus but do not "confess" Him as Lord, the Word made flesh.  They deny his physical bodily resurrection and they deny that Jesus atoned for the sins of the world .<br>   <br>  The second Test is "Are They in Harmony with the Word of God?" Does the message they bring agree with what we know of the word of God in the Bible or does what they say contradict scripture?<br>   <br>  If someone brings us false doctrine, a false gospel, a false Christ (Gal 1:6-9, 2 Cor. 11:4) we must reject it. <br>   <br>  How do we know they are false? <br>   <br>  We compare it to what God has already told us. <br>  <br>   <br>  This can require a great deal of discernment on our part because Demons can sound very convincing, the Bible warns about their "lying signs and wonders" because they know all the right buttons to push and how to make their false message sound very attractive to us.<br>  <br>  We therefore don't go by their "signs", instead we judge on the basis of what message do they bring along with those signs?|`|qcEzJDY6aa	If there is satan ( I don't believe this one) his tricks would not last for long, but if it's God's sign it would be forever lasting.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	"You talk to God, you're religious.

CjRfJbncaa	Origen (third century C.E.), in answering the attack of the pagan philosopher Celsus that “[Christians] set no value on the oracles of the Pythian priestess,” declared:<br>  <br>  “It is said of the Pythian priestess, whose oracle seems to have been the most celebrated, that when she sat down at the mouth of the Castalian cave, the prophetic spirit of Apollo entered her private parts. . . . Moreover, it is not the part of a divine spirit to drive the prophetess into such a state of ecstasy and madness that she loses control of herself. . . . If, then, the Pythian priestess is beside herself when she prophesies, what spirit must that be which fills her mind and clouds her judgment with darkness, unless it be of the same order with those demons which many Christians cast out?”<br>  —Origen Against Celsus, Book VIII, chaps. iii, iv.<br>  <br>  "... You must not look for omens, and you must not practice magic." -- Leviticus 19:26b  <br>  <br>  "...Many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly. 19 Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody..." --Acts19:18,19  <br>  <br>  Yes, there are both faithful, &, unfaithful angels.  However, the only ones at present who sometimes contact humans, are the latter.

He said that in just a few months he had received scores of calls for help by distressed parents or by young persons because of the way they had been affected from playing with the Ouija talking board. He appealed: “Please leave them alone, they can cause irreparable brain damage. . . . If only people would realise how dangerous it is to dabble in this.” He also stated that playing with the Ouija board can cause a deep and worsening depression and can open the way to “evil spirit entities.” He told of persons being troubled by spirits that claim to be people who once lived; that one girl was plagued by a spirit who *claimed* she was that of a young girl who recently committed suicide.<br>  <br>  In the United States both spiritualists and astrologers have spoken out against toying with the Ouija board. They call it “harmful and fraudulent,” causing people to become emotionally upset even to the point of becoming insane. According to one of these, the Ouija board is “the first step into the demon world—and don’t think demons do not exist.”—The Oregon Journal, December 12, 1968.|`|k03dYskYaa	Bad things can happen if you use spiritism to try to contact an "angel"<br>  The use of divination as a means to “communicate” with angels is not uncommon. One source outrightly encourages its readers to employ rune stones, tarot cards, I Ching coins, palmistry, and astrology. “Allow your inner knowing self to lead you to the right oracle,” the authors write, “and trust that an angel will meet you there.”<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, however, whatever ‘meets you there’ certainly is not one of God’s angels. Why? Because divination stands in open defiance of God, and true worshipers—in heaven and on earth—have nothing to do with it. Why, in Israel divination was a capital offense! “Everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah,” the Law stated.—Deuteronomy 13:1-5; 18:10-12.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that Satan “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:14) He can even fabricate portents and then make them come true, deceiving onlookers into thinking that the omen is from God.|`|NJpihlsHaa	Trying to communicate with angels is not bad. There are bad angels (i.e. Satan). If anything, I think an oracle kit would hurt due to the fact that you are putting your faith in something other than God who is the only one that directs angels (an oracle kit doesn't have any heavenly jurisdiction). Hope it helps.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	it's not that they are good and bad but that they don't actually exist except in your mind.

Angels are nothing but good. They are God's helpers and our protectors. Ever hear of a story of someone being saved or warned by a stranger, and then the stranger oddly dissapears? Thats an angel! Angels will only bring you love, protection, hope, ect. Angel appear to us in photos, as orbs (or circles of light). Ever get a photo back with a perfect round circle in it and blame it on the lighting or a speck on the lens, nope thats an angel. They are most often captured at weddings, family gatherings, and Christmas. Please, dont get into the oracle kits and Quiji boards for they can became a tool for our minds to obsess and worry over the 'messages' we recieve from them. I strongly suggest reading anything by Sylvia Browne, but for you especially her Book of Angels. God Bless and hopes this helps :)<br>  \|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	I dont know what a oracle kit is.... dont want to know. I dont need to speak to angels when I can speak directly to the Father who created them. <br>  As for ildivoluver who stated that satan can never appear as an angel I would refer her to the scriptures.....<br>  2Corinthians 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.<br>  <br>  If you need to seek Godly advice dear one go to the scriptures and pray to the Father who loves you... no need to look into these "oracle kits" or anything else... just go to God with all your heart and learn from him.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	They aren't going to talk to you.|`|AA10057370	Pray (talk to) Jesus (God).<br>  Yes there are good angels and demons.<br>  Don't seek them.
IFQFt25naa	Well  I personally disagree with a lot of the things he says.  He is an OK actor (not one of the greatest, not one of the worst either, just an in the middle OK actor).<br>  <br>  However, I will have to give him credit, He said shortly after “Growing Pains” (the tv sit-com that made him famous.) that he was going to work with religious groups and be doing religious films basically devoting his life to God.  That was nearly 20 years ago (The show ended in 1992.)   And he is still doing it.  I think he is still married to his only wife since 1991. For Hollywood and public figures that is an amazingly long time.  (These days that is an amazingly long time even for non public figures.)<br>  <br>  So while I do not agree with all of his statements about God or anything else for that matter.  (Something things I do agree with others I don’t)<br>  <br>  But regardless of what I think about him (or if I think his actions or statements are correct or incorrect), I have respect for him.  Because he has stayed with the faith he said he had and has continued to do what he said he was going to do.<br>  <br>  There are so many that have said similar things about working with  faith and God, that did it for a few years, then move on to something else after they lost interest.<br>  <br>  Cameron, on the other hand, has stuck to it and, from what I can see, continues to follow his faith in God.<br>  <br>  So for what it is worth, while I don’t really care for some of the things he has said or done over the years, I respect him for continuing to do what he said he would so long ago.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|pakIAYWoaa	kirk is a man of conviction and cares enough to yell out to the world the foolishness of attributing everything that exists to nothing; the man has faith in Christ and does an adequate job raising the larger questions in life.

5nfqY9T7aa	I'm 25 and I don't have to drink to have a good time.  I do go out shopping, visit coffee shops and places with live music, go out to restaurants, movies, house parties, the beach, play video games with friends, etc.  There's tons of stuff you can do without having to go out and drink all the time.  It gets old after a while.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Hang out with friends, go to movies, out to dinner or stay home and watch movies/DVDs and read.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	I'm 22 and I don't really like to do anything on the weekend. After a busy week in school and work, I really need those couple of days just to recharge my batteries. It definitely doesn't make me very popular, but I'm not trying to impress anyone. <br>  <br>  If people ask me what I did, I just say that I got a lot of work done.|`|AA11198190	Heaps to do.....<br>  You can go to the movies.<br>  Have a night in with friends...play cards,board games,video games,nintendo....and enjoy each others company.<br>  Play indoor sports.<br>  Visit family.<br>  Have a night out at a restaurant....<br>  Or you can sit here on Yahoo.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Whatever you find to do on the weekend nights, don't feel like a loser if it doesn't involve loud bars and drinking. Save your money and find some friends that enjoy just hanging out and you'll be a lot better off in the long run. If there's nobody around to hang out with, find a hobby that will keep you busy and productive. Nobody NEEDS alcohol and loud music to be social, they just think they do. If someone asks what you did over the weekend, you can just tell them you were productive and then ask what THEY did.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I am so glad that you asked this questions because many people feel that the only way to have a good time is involving alcohol.  My doctor advised me not to drink alcohol beverages (or do it in moderation) because I have acid reflux. Some of my friends understand my health concerns while others like to pressure me. It gets annoying! <br>  <br>  There are many thiings you can do such as - <br>  <br>  Comedy Clubs<br>  Movies <br>  Coffee Shops <br>  Shopping<br>  Mani/Pedis<br>  Amusement Parks (if weather permits)<br>  Ice Skating<br>  Sporting Events (if weather permits)<br>  Take a walk in a nice park with a book<br>  The beach (if weather permits)<br>  The list goes on ...|`|DTPfhl7Eaa	I don't feel like a loser if I stay in.<br>  <br>  There is LOADS to do: go to fitness, go to the sauna, watch DVDs, read, clean the flat, go clothes shopping.  Quite honestly, I can do plenty during the day which means I don't feel the NEED to go out Fri and Sat evening.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I just got a lovely new boyfriend so my weekend evenings are pretty occupied right now!|`|ho4skDEdaa	Go to the gym, travel, play video games, etc...plenty of things to do besides going to bars and clubs|`|N4xd99Qaaa	I use to drink all the time. I would go out fri/sat night to a bar/club for the sole purpose of drinking and getting drunk. I had a problem and I fixed that. Now I really don't drink anymore. Fri/Sat I normally will go over to friends house. Maybe catch a movie. Go out to dinner or take walks on the beach. I still go to bars to listen to live music and usually drink soda, water or cranberry juice.My friends respect my choice when I don't drink so there really isn't any peer pressure.|`|abughBHAaa	I'm not an alcoholic by any means, but I LOVE going to dive bars on either Friday or Saturday night (just not both nights).  I must admit that night out is the highlight of my week and I don't even get drunk.  I just love going to places like Coyote Ugly and getting a nice buzz, meeting new interesting people from all over the world in an atmosphere where people are feeling more social and relaxed.  Now on the "other" weekend night, I spend with my gf.  We normally either just stay home and watch television if the weather is too cold or go to a comedy club, coffee lounge, the movies, and I'm still trying to get her to go bowling with me.  Yes, there are other fun things to do aside going out to the bars, but if it's a really FUN bar, then it's definitely worth going to at least once a week in my opinion.|`|bMVJkCShaa	I'm 24 and a bit of a stoner (I like my creature comforts as well) - I hate going to bars and pubs, and despise clubs even more!<br>  <br>  Weekends me and my girlfriend either have mates round ours, or we'll go out to see them at their houses, or we might see the parents. It's been so long since we've actually had a quiet weekend that I'm really looking forward to the next one!<br>  <br>  Point: just because you don't go to bars etc, doesn't mean your weekends will be quiet!!|`|cXD5pt5paa	I am a bartender and you are NO loser, I see all the time and money that is wasted in bars. Not to mention the bad habits that are formed.<br>   Some ideas, the movies, bowling, skating, bus trips are fun(to many different places) Casinos( win some money) or if that weekend your a little short on money, no matter what faith you are, there are a lot of churches with activities for adults and children.<br>   My favorite, trying out different places to eat, Warm daddys in Philly is great they always have shows after you eat.
IKif85LUaa	God's will was for mankind to be fruitful and to multiply. This means other things, just not procreation. For the subject, however, we will use this. No; you are wrong. God didn't create or expect homosexuals. Just the same as He didn't create or want cancer, disasters, murder, or rapes. All of these stem from a not knowing on God's perfect will for mankind. What do you think God wanted us to be fruitful and multiply? His love, truth, goodness, perfect and all good. Any form of pain and suffering are not from God. Homosexuals, as well as heterosexuals, have a degree of pain, either of the heart, will, or body. This is not God's will. He desires godly offspring who desire to carry out His will and that means to fill the earth will all good, love, truth, and righteousness. <br>  Marriage is a binding contract--vow--covenant, not only between each other but with God. God cannot go against His own will and words. Therefore, He cannot enter into a covenant-blood-bought vow and agree with someone's will that goes against His. Does His love change for them? Not a bit. Is His mercy and grace for them? At all times.|`|VlfV7uiZaa	Genesis 19:1-13; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9 all say its a sin. It states that god does not create homosexuals and the only way to become one is by way of sin.<br>  <br>  This is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Here we go again with religion trying to control our lives.|`|Nyjck3Utaa	"If so then why did god put that in there when he knew that someday there would be homosexuals..."<br>  <br>  <br>  So the Homosexuals couldn't get married.

And most certainly was never in the earlier manuscripts. Its an interpolation.|`|oopg697aaa	Bible is Screwed up don't follow it. It will only make you a moron|`|IKyITYICaa	There is no rule against homosexual marriage in the Bible.  In the Bible it says "Thou shalt not lay down with another man."  But in the old days, there was no concept of one man loving another.  What the Bible was talking about is what today we would call rape or sodomy.  That is what God was talking about.  It's just been distorted by people with an agenda.|`|AA10641825	He said they're not supposed to even get friendly.

When you die and go to heaven, you'll know.|`|VzCygD6taa	May be you would like to tell us were this “certain place” is.<br>  <br>  Old and New Testaments clearly state the same sex relationships are an abomination to God the Creator of life on this planet.  <br>  <br>  Here is what the Bible says –<br>  <br>  Leviticus 18:22-23 <br>  "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination." <br>  Leviticus 20:13 <br>  "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death." <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9 <br>  "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals" <br>  1 Timothy 1:9-10 <br>  "realizing the fact that (civil) law is not made for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers" <br>  Romans 1:26-27 <br>  "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error."|`|SbN2cXE5aa	He says that homosexuality is a sin.  Therefore it goes without saying that they can't marry, at least with His blessing in a traditional marriage.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not something that caught God off guard, they have been around probably since the beginning, and He does not sanction any type of sin.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Homosexuality has been around long before human beings first evolved.  Animals engage in it, just as we do, especially Bonobo apes.<br>  <br>  In Ancient Greece, homosexuality was considered perfectly normal and you were expected to court a member of the same sex to love.|`|ULUpOqplaa	God didn't put it in there.  man did to prevent the spread of disease.

k4T1Jgblaa	Unfortunately, what you say is very true.<br>    In fact, women have occasionaly said to me that men often assume that all 'good-looking men are gay.<br>  <br>   It's probably because ordinary-looking men are either envious, or associate good-looking men with the gay male model stereotype.<br>  <br>   Also, for some reason ,Anglo-Saxon men seem to have appalling dress sense - ie everything clashes !   In the UK if you look as if you have thought about what you are wearing, you are regarded as gay.<br>  <br>  And insecure, usually ugly men will say it out loud.<br>  <br>  It shows a complete contrast to men in (say) Italy, where it is not regarded as macho to dress like a slob.<br>  <br>  It's all very sad, but true.<br>  <br>  And anyone who gives me the thumbs-down is probably an ugly, badly- dressed male from the UK.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	It's just a rude phrase that has come about over the past few years and as far as I'm concerned it has about as much meaning as "that's messed up", which is another phrase that sounds ignorant and is over used to the point of having no meaning at all. I don't think people that call others "gay" actually mean it in the sense that the person is gay, but rather a little fickle or insane or is dressed weird or something of that nature. I don't really think it is used to refer to the sexual orientation of a person in most cases or that it reflects the closeted sexual orientation of the person using the word. This is truly one of those ignorant phrases that unlike some of the things we hear today, is JUST a word. This is just my opinion and I could be wrong, of course........|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I think perhaps you are very young if you see this happening on a normal basis, right?  Before the word gay, they called homosexuals many other insults du jour, including ******t, qu*eer, twinkle toes, and many other even worse things.  Actually, mature adults do it less than than 40 years ago it seems.<br>  <br>  Some people think they are empowered by degrading others who are not exactly like themselves.  Always has been, always will be, for those of our culture who lack real self esteem.|`|7wwLbWN1aa	Because they are ignorant.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	In many circles, gay doesn't even refer to homosexuality any more. How often do you hear people saying "it's so gay", "he's so gay", "she's so gay", or "that's gay". It's become more of an expression than a lifestyle. That's probably what they mean, rather than that what or who they are talking about is homosexual.|`|sXnoIFRsaa	I think the meaning of the word has lost its translation over the generations and folks are now using the word Gay to mean odd...  Simply put it is offensive and shows utter lack of social skills.  What you need to do is call people out as soon as they say it.  Once they realize it is in bad taste to say things like this they to will learn, but only if you teach them!|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Personally, I will not call someone gay to their face whether I thought they were "acting" in a feminine way (assuming wer'e talking about a male) or otherwise.|`|3KNnYzgqaa	Calling ANYBODY gay, is rude.<br>  I'm gay, and I get offended when people call gay/straight/bi people, gay.<br>  It's rude, and disrespectful.|`|AA11571284	In my day, "gay" meant "happy".|`|AA12330838	coz people no longer pay attention to colors, make up , hair styles they do , so we don't know who is who!|`|VkXv4RInaa	its really not that big of a deal... it would be different if someone threatened someone because of their sexual preference - but just stating that they are gay? big deal|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	The term may be used rather indiscriminately, and when it is used around you, ask the person why they say that. Usually they have no answer.
gASz3hDWaa	What proof is there of your claims against the Israelites?<br>  <br>  You made a statement against a group of people yet offer no source. The Israelites were a nation of God, who obeyed what God commanded. When they did fail to do as God commanded it was recorded in the Bible and their errors even gross ones were laid bare in the scriptures. Pedophilia was unlikely something that was a problem with the nation of Israelites as a whole.<br>  <br>  Remember not to put our standards against God's standards which are far supreme. Not forgetting that even our society is not so against pedophilia that "sexy" clothes for even infants such as thongs and high heels and other "raunchy" copying of adult fashion can be purchased legally in USA and Europe and well as other developed nations. And that school children are encouraged with sex advice encouragement rather than teaching them complete abstention and chasteness. <br>  The Israelites practiced marital sex unlike today's mostly promiscuos careless society. Child sex is a by far bigger issue today then it was back in ancient Israel.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	It was dictated by custom. 13-14 was the norm, not just in Israel but throughout the ancient Meditteranean world from Rome to Greece to Egypt.<br>  <br>  It was based on the age of puberty.|`|ttGk4VOxaa	Religion was created by men who wanted to justify their actions.  Men were prejudice against homosexuals so they wrote into their religion that homosexuality was against God.  But the same men were banging kids, so they didn't write that stuff into their religion.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I believe the rule of thumb is: "If there's grass on the field, it's time to play ball"...
5qjxyb0jaa	Because they quote the bible .<br>  <br>  From the OT , Le 17:14<br>  because the life of every creature is its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites, "You must not eat the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who eats it must be cut off." <br>  <br>  Le 7:26 &27<br>  26 And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal. 27 If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.' "<br>  <br>  From the NT Acts 15:28&29<br>  28It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: 29You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. <br>  <br>  Acts 21:25<br>  25 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality." <br>  <br>  Are you Christian ?

As they wanted it kept in Latin, as the common people should not know what was in the Bible but just believe what the religious leaders told them. When the Bible was eventually translated it was noted that there was, with some words, no translation in English, and passages tweaked to suit the times, how many times do you think this happened over the ages, the problem is the people who take the Bible literally and not the tone or the overall message. Remember the Bible was written by men to suite the times it was written in. im not saying don't believe it but believe the message and not literally.|`|v6SEg6gvaa	Jesus prophesied that Christians would be the majority of the population.<br>  And it was.<br>  Then he predicted that in the end times , there will be more non-believers.<br>  and there is.<br>  <br>  Some parts of the bible were perverted , but if the prophecy is true , then millions are going to heaven because of the bible we have today.|`|EtUkys6Waa	Hey Sis,  I have been a Bible teacher for a long time and it has been my experience that the old fashioned King James Version still works best.

Also the different versions are handled by hundreds of translators - so no one person could "slip in" his own piece of information and go unnoticed - and even if he did, we still have the original language to go back to.<br>  My advice to you is if you are having difficulty with any one piece of scripture, have a look at how other versions translate the passage - or get a descent commentary or get a Hebrew/Greek lexicon.<br>  Maybe it is not the translation that is in error - maybe its just you who are wrong.|`|sfTPrMFpaa	This is a common occurrence for such old literature. <br>  <br>  It is a really interesting field of study for a translator: <a href="http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=hnk" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/Plai...</a><br>  <br>  If you can read French, I would recommand to you "Au commencement" by, amongst others, Henri Meschonnic. He tried to render in French the poetry of the the first known hebraic version. Here is an extract:<br>  <br>  Ce sont là les naissances du ciel et de la terre quand ils furent créés<br>  Le jour qu’Adona? Dieu a fait la terre et le ciel       <br>  (Genèse 2,4 )<br>  <br>  In English it would be like (pardon in advance for my skills lesser than those of the French poet)<br>  <br>  Those are the births of the sky and the earth when they were created<br>  The day Adona? God made the earth and the sky.<br>  (Genesis 2,4 )<br>  <br>  So, as a translator it is a really interesting question, and I am sure that as a believer you could also gain from looking at those earlier versions of the text.|`|WS95be3Raa	Ok, I will not tell that the entire book is a lie.

Just have faith and you will belive. <br>  <br>  Just believe and you will believe.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Absolutely, the Bible is accurate.  We know this (we don't speculate, we know) for a couple of very important reasons.<br>  <br>  First, the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, people could claim that it was possible that the Old Testament had been changed at the hands of Jewish scribes, and that it was possible errors were introduced in the process of copying.  (There are reasons this claim was extremely unlikely, but let's assume that the claim has merit.)<br>  <br>  When the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, it ended this argument forever.  The books of the Bible in the Dead Sea Scrolls date from about 100 B.C, about 900 years older than the previously oldest known copies.  When they were compared, it was clear that the scriptures had not been changed over that lengthy period of time.  Where there was a concern about copying accurately (such as when two Hebrew letters touched and could possibly be read differently), the scribes didn't just make a change -- they noted the problem in the margin of the text so as to preserve the original.  (This is a very basic explanation for the purposes of this answer, but you get the point and can research the Dead Sea Scrolls if you need more information.)<br>  <br>  You can be certain that the Old Testament of the Bible has not been changed.<br>  <br>  Second, the New Testament is clearly an accurate rendition of what was written, and again it's archaeology that proves it.<br>  <br>  We have over 5,000 very early copies and fragments of copies of the books of the New Testament.  That's more copies than we have of ANY other book of antiquity, by an order of 100.  The early church thought the books were scripture, and they copied them and forwarded them to other churches.  Those many copies all read the same -- we don't have different versions of them that are contradictory.<br>  <br>  In addition, those copies are very early copies -- within about 30 to 50 years of the originals, well within the lifetimes of those who witnessed the events firsthand.  If the copies contained errors or falsifications, any witness could have either raised the issue of the error, or written their own version of the actual events.  But we don't have contradictory accounts, despite the fact that scripture reports thousands of witnesses to Christ's ministry and certainly hundreds of thousands (or more) people had access to the copies of those early books.<br>  <br>  If you accept the accuracy of Plato's Republic -- which has only two early copies made more than 500 years after the original -- then you should accept the accuracy of the New Testament books with their thousands of copies less than 60 years after the originals.<br>  <br>  Third, the contents of the Bible have been demonstrated to be accurate by archaeology.  It is often used as a tool by archaeologists to help pinpoint the location of ancient cities and ports, to clarify terms and titles used in the ancient world, to validate rulers and civilizations uncovered in digs, etc.I  n fact, the archaeologist's spade has never found something to disprove the Bible.<br>  <br>  Fourth, there are many other reasons to know the Bible is accurate.  I've linked a couple of pages below.  The discipline of textual criticism is a very detailed, very exact branch of archaeology, and far far more intelligent and experienced people than me have studied these works and arrived at these conclusions.  If the Bible had been proven in error, you'd see it on the evening news.<br>  <br>  It's worth noting that another "holy" book, the Koran, doesn't have this same pedigree.  When the Koran was new, there were many very different versions in circulation that were contradictory.  There were so many, in fact, that the competing versions were edited into one single versions and the others were all ordered destroyed.  We have no way of knowing what the original Koran actually said.<br>  <br>  But we can be sure of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.  To reject these as being inaccurate is to reject scientific findings of accuracy.  What you believe about the contents of the Bible is up to you, but you can't refute the accuracy of scripture intelligently.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I don't know where your faith is, but mine is in a God who is powerful enough to keep His word from being corrupted by man. I think you either believe the Bible or you don't. Yes, there may be parts we wish were not true, but if we could pick and choose which of it we wanted to believe, there would not really be any sacrifice in our belief, would there? I would not say that is is necessarily bad to question, but I think you need to sort it out with God, through prayer and reading of the word, why you have trouble accepting parts of it as truth. I hope that you come to this resolution before you fall into a crisis of faith. God bless.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	Get a few different translations( Not paraphrases) & check the verses,<br>  also pray & ask for wisdom.<br>  Much of it is right, where mistakes are made is in the vowel points &<br>  not reading the Hebrew correctly.<br>  For instance Mt 26:9 Y'shua was suppossedly in the house of simon<br>  the leper, lepers were not permitted to live in the city, so the word<br>  GAR'BA=leper was taken instead of GARABA=jar maker, see Mk14:3<br>  Simon was a jar merchant.<br>  There are many more, because people do not know Hebrew & say the<br>  NT was originally written in greek, which is a lie.|`|b0IYXTcBaa	There are too many copies from to many distant parts of the world for this type of practice to have taken root. The scriptures were copied by hundreds of people, the problem you suggest would only really be a factor if we only had one copy of scripture or at some point only one person was copying scripture. At no point was this the case so the scriptures can be tested against themselves and errors like this are found and corrected.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	You have a very good point, I never thought about that before..<br>  But there's nothing wrong with thinking that.

Worship isnt true worship if it isnt something  that comes from your heart.  Though I STRONGLY believe it is important to be educated and to arm yourself with the word of God, I also much much more strongly believe that without true belief, or true love and understanding of what God is all about and why Jesus chose to die for your sins...all your education and sacrifce means nothing.  You cant just put all the religions in a hat and pick one to be because it looks the best and has the best history, it doesnt work that way.  In the Bible thats what the pharasees and saducees did, they knew the bible front to back without a TRUE understanding, and they missed to boat.  I pray that you decide to become a Christian because you love Jesus with all your heart and believe he died for your sins, not because its what looks good to you for the moment.

I like to think that all the various gods of whatever religion could exist.  To me, a God is not a physical being.  I don't believe in creationism or whatever other stories are associated with many religions.  I think a belief in God is more a belief that there is a reason for living, and gives us the hope and faith that there is something more than our physical existence.  Humans need guidance and belief that life is worth living, and so long as we have faith that there is something out there that we cannot understand, we can have hope that our lives are worth something.<br>  <br>  You could debate the physical existence of God for ages and never reach a solution that everybody agrees on.  Everyone has their own individual beliefs - sometimes very strong beliefs.  Sometimes its better to develop your own philosophy on life and Gods etc. rather than try to fit yourself into a pre-set mould.

The number is calculated as 40m GBP per year (which is the budget) divided by the population of the country, 60m people. <br>  - Some of that money goes towards maintenance of the castles, and would be spent anyway. By most conventional thinking the castles, the crown jewels, the art work, the land has already been confiscated in 1760. The "crown estate" is run as  a modern corporation and has revenue in excess of 215m pounds per year. All that money goes to public revenue controlled by parliament. The queen owns Balmoral, Sandringham, some personal art and jewelry, and a stock portfolio worth about 100m GBP.<br>  =========<br>  The queen is considered to be a "rich" person, but the fortune is miniscule compared to that controlled by the Duke of Westminster.

They basically inherited their wealth from their father. Even their cousins who only inherited a few percentage points of the family wealth are worth more than The Queen.

The Royal Family cost us nothing, the income from the Crown Estates (the Queen's personal property) is paid to the government who use this to pay the civil list (and get to keep the change). The money for the Privy Purse comes from the Duchy of Lancaster (again the Queen's personal property).<br>  <br>  If the people were to reclaim the Crown Jewels, art and buildings the idiotic left wing government will sell them off for a fraction of their true value to some Russian Oligarch or Indian or Iranian Multi-millionaire businessman and the British people would benefit none.<br>  <br>  Please research the facts then think your statement through and you'll see how very very wrong you are.|`|7oA361fbaa	The Royal family are fabulous and anyone who thinks otherwise is a traitor and should be thrown out of Britain.|`|addec7857a715f2e28715837812ec5fbaa	70p ... nonsense.  The royal estates are of themselves imposed  tenancies;   rack-renting impositions|`|NYU37jfGaa	The amount we pay in tax to support the royal family is relatively modest, considerably less than many elected presidents cost fo rinstance.<br>  <br>  The Queen does a good job as head of state, and I am quite satisfied to keep things as they are.  The royal family are paid out of the income from the Civil List, and are cheap at the price in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I would rather keep the royal family than have some dreary elected nonetity any day.  and they wouldn't cost any less.  And do you really think that the palaces etc would be given back to 'the people' if the royal family went?  Like hell they would.  They'd just become posh residents for politicians.

D3sFM6cyaa	God expects everyone to be perfect as He is. Anyone who has sinned one time has fallen short of God's standard. The first step is to recognize that you have sinned and fall short of the standard God has set for you.<br>  <br>  There is Good News though. God sent His Son, Jesus, to die on the cross and raise from the dead to pay for every sin ever committed and every sin that will ever be committed. The second step is to realize that this statement is true about you. Jesus died to pay for your sins.<br>  <br>  The next step is to repent from your sins. You need to turn away from all of your sins and change your lifestyle such that you will truly want to do the will of God because of what He has done for you.<br>  <br>  Then, ask Jesus to come into your heart to be your Savior and your Lord.<br>  <br>  This can all be done by saying a prayer similar to this one:<br>  <br>  God, I'm sorry for my sin. I turn from it right now. I thank you for sending Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sin.<br>  Jesus, I ask you to come into my heart and life right now. Be my Lord, Savior, and Friend. Help me to follow you all the days of my life as your disciple.<br>  Thank you for forgiving and receiving me right now. Thank you that my sin is forgiven and that I am going to heaven.

Abandon logic. <br>  This is crucial step. It is because Christian's God is ONE, but actually composed of 3 distict individual. Even though it is not been told in Bible. At last, you can only imagine that the God is Three Head God.<br>  <br>  2. Lend Your Eyes/Hear To Watch/Hear Telenovela<br>  The central telenovela in Christianity is that the One God send himself to impregnated his own mother to let himself to be born, just to be crucified by Pharisees, so the God will forgive people from something that the God made by the God himself (Sins) <br>  <br>  3. Choose Suitable Myth.<br>  There is a lot of mythology in Christianity. There is a group named "Catholics". They believe in Sacred Mysteries for Salvation. Baptism, Eucharist, Ordained Priest etc. Another Group named Orthodox opposed Catholicsm because they claim that "Catholic change the fillouque (Holy Spirit is derived from Son and Father in Catholism)". There is another Group named Prebester which claim that Pope is anti-Christ. There is another Group (Anglican) which been founded because the leader want to marry sister of his wife. The is another group (JW) that DIDN'T believe that JESUS IS GOD and prohibit blood transfusion. There is another group that did NOT believe Jesus and Holy Spirit is God. There is another Group that didn't believe Holy Spirit is a God.<br>  <br>  4. Then after these step, you can choose to go to anywhere of the churches.

The same way they write "R" for what sounds like "L". It's just conventional.<br>  <br>  Detail: I do agree with you that there is a light "g" (like in the English word 'singing') in pronunciation of final 'N' in Japanese. I forgot the name of this sound in linguistics but it has a specific transcription in phonetics. The problem is that many Westerners do not even hear it and Japanese do it just naturally. As a prove, did you notice that Japanese never end a word with a consonant? except "n" which is not a pure "N" but ng.. You must be Asian yourself and/or have a good ear!|`|KiN3KVihaa	no...they write it in romaji like that because that is the way it is said/written.  there is not g-sound at the end.
TVJsOEKNaa	Flowers are not a Jewish custom, but a Christian one: <br>  <br>  The Jewish custom of placing stones on graves "probably serves as a reminder of the family's presence. It is evidence that this grave is attended, visited, cared for and is respectful for the deceased.<br>  <br>  By placing a stone we further participate in the "construction" of the tombstone -- which in itself constitutes a mitzvah.  Stones do not wither away within a week or so like flowers do.<br>  <br>  When someone passes, it is customary to give money to an appropriate charity (if the person died of cancer, then this would be a cancer foundation). <br>  <br>  It is forbidden: Just pray/ask for forgiveness and don't do it anymore.  <br>  <br>  The link below explains the different stages of mourning which may be useful to you.|`|daBtvDv7aa	your not bring it as an offering.. go to bed|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Judaism does not involve ancestor worship so people don't bring offerings.<br>  <br>  It's customary to put a rock on the grave, however in the U.S. flowers are a common site at jewish cemeteries.<br>  <br>  The rock custom likely originated because in the desert it was often difficult to dig very deep so graves would be covered with rocks to protect them from scavengers and from being uncovered. Rocks would be placed on the grave at each visit to insure it remained covered.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Mark S & Moo gave great answers.  <br>  <br>  On a practical level I always figured it was because if you're living in a desert or wandering through - you can usually find a stone (desert isn't just sand), but flowers maybe not so much.<br>  <br>  Also, flowers are cheery.  Judaism has a whole cycle for mouring, that allows for the sorrow.  For instance, the first week is sitting shiva & it's a time of covering mirrors so you don't worry about your appearences & cry as much as you need to.  It's not a time to "cheer up" those left behind, but a time to help them grieve.<br>  <br>  (However, just to give an accurate picture, Israel now has a ton of flowers.  They are everywhere & everything is well tended to.  They just aren't on the graves.)<br>  <br>  =========<br>  I've never heard the bit about not keeping the soul around that someone else answered.  It's certainly not a common thought, but is it coming from a particular kabbalah understanding?  I'll star & I hope some others can come through & answer -- though Mark S is extremely knowledgable.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Flowers in Judaism are seen as a sign of joy.  That's why they're not brought to funerals.  It has nothing to do with anything else.<br>  <br>  Pebbles are brought when one *visits* a gravesite, as a reminder that someone has been there.  They are *not* brought at the time of the funeral.|`|VSuprpdJaa	i thought our god was named "adoni" it's in all the prayers and means god in hebrew. anyway you can bring flowers, it's only a offering if you burn them. and people don't bring there own rocks to put on a grave, we just pick one up from the ground to show that someone visited the person who is dead|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	There is a difference between bringing something as an offering, or as a remembrance. For example, a friend of mine who passed away loved spending time in her rose garden, so whenever I visit her grave, I bring a rose or two. Not as an offering or gift to her, but as a tactile, tangible way for me to remember the times we spent together, and her personality. I don't worship her, nor do I pray to her, or treat her grave as an idol. I don't take it to benefit her, or anyone else. In fact, bringing flowers is only for me. <br>  <br>  Much like the Jews of the times of Abraham left a pile of rocks to remember an event, we bring flowers to remember times with the person who has passed. The tombstone itself is akin to the old stone piles, signifying the importance of the area.|`|viqIb6X7aa	you arre not supposed to leave flowers.<br>  It is Jewish custom place rocks on the grave (you pick up rocks from the ground near the grave)<br>  If you are really worried about it you can probably do tshvua- but you should really ask a rabbi.

EvyY3dUNaa	Mainframes (often colloquially referred to as Big Iron) are computers used mainly by large organizations for critical applications, typically bulk data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, ERP, and financial transaction processing.<br>  <br>  The term probably had originated from the early mainframes, as they were housed in enormous, room-sized metal boxes or frames. Later the term was used to distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units.<br>  <br>  Modern mainframe computers have abilities not so much defined by their single task computational speed (usually defined as MIPS — Millions of Instructions Per Second) as by their redundant internal engineering and resulting high reliability and security, extensive input-output facilities, strict backward compatibility with older software, and high utilization rates to support massive throughput. These machines often run for years without interruption, with repairs and hardware upgrades taking place during normal operation<br>  <br>  CHARACETERISTICS<br>  Nearly all mainframes have the ability to run (or host) multiple operating systems, and thereby operate not as a single computer but as a number of virtual machines. In this role, a single mainframe can replace dozens or even hundreds of smaller servers. While mainframes pioneered this capability, it is now available on most families of computer systems.<br>  <br>  Mainframes can add or hot swap system capacity non disruptively and granularly, however this also is a capability on other types of server. Modern mainframes, notably the IBM zSeries, System z9 and System z10 servers, offer three levels of virtualization: logical partitions (LPARs, via the PR/SM facility), virtual machines (via the z/VM operating system), and through its operating systems (notably z/OS with its key-protected address spaces and sophisticated goal-oriented workload scheduling<br>  <br>  <br>  Mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing. z900 and z990 and System z9 and z10 servers execute each instruction twice,[citation needed] compare results, and shift workloads "in flight" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to applications or users. This feature, also found in HP's NonStop systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their "steps" (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Speed and performance<br>  The CPU speed of mainframes has historically been measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS). MIPS have been used as an oversimplified comparative rating of the speed and capacity of mainframes. The smallest System z9 IBM mainframes today run at about 26 MIPS and the largest System z10 at about 30,657 MIPS — a 1 to 1179 performance capacity ratio. IBM's Parallel Sysplex technology can join up to 32 of these systems, making them behave like a single, logical computing facility of as much as about 981,024 MIPS<br>  <br>  The MIPS measurement has long been known to be misleading and has often been parodied as "Meaningless Indicator of Processor Speed." The complex CPU architectures of modern mainframes have reduced the relevance of MIPS ratings to the actual number of instructions executed. Likewise, the modern "balanced performance" system designs focus both on CPU power and on I/O capacity, and virtualization capabilities make comparative measurements even more difficult. See benchmark (computing) for a brief discussion of the difficulties in benchmarking such systems. IBM has long published a set of LSPR (Large System Performance Reference) ratio tables for mainframes that take into account different types of workloads and are a more representative measurement of several categories of mainframe workloads. However, these comparisons are not available for non-IBM systems and cannot be directly used for cross-platform comparisons. It takes a fair amount of work (and maybe guesswork) for users to determine what type of workload they have and then apply only the LSPR values most relevant to them. Also, IBM does not measure all workloads on all possible configurations, so some estimates are inaccurate|`|VUdaZUpwaa	Hi,<br>     This is a little off the beaten path for a language board, but just a few words:  First it would take a fairly extensive course in computers to explain effectively how mainframe computers work.  Just as a summary, mainframe computers work basically the same as PCs.  They may gain speed over PCs by using circuitry that consumes considerably more power, and they may employ parallel processing more extensively than PCs.  They will also have more storage capability in most cases and take up much more space than PCs.  Generally, they're designed for high speed computations--number crunching--rather than for complicated and visually appealing graphics as PCs are.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.<br>  FE

I believe if the government was involved with the taxation of privately owned corporations and had more businesses besides law enforcement and such, the money could be sent to people in need, to schools, road repair, and the wealthy could still have enough money, although, they're just afraid to give it up, believing 'I'm giving people that don't work my hard-earned money.' Also, they only fear the obvious after remembering the history, saying, "That's socialism!" without even thinking of how much it can help. I think, "Seriously dude, just help, because it's for a good cause." <br>  <br>  I'm all for liberty and I believe people should be able to have children at anytime, and the CONTEMPORARY government should change its policy to help them. For instance, you mentioned, "Less food, no clothes, bad medical care, etc." Well, personally, I remember in history, we were entitled to 'life, liberty, and property,' and therefore, if people struggle to get it, the government should amend certain instances to help them instead of letting them suffer. I believe it's against out freedom, which this country is ALL FOR, to tell us NOT to have children when we can't afford.<br>  <br>  I mean, we're ALLOWED to do what's not illegal. We're humans too and we shall NOT be excluded because of a simple thing that can be fixed. Instead of watching them die and starve, change the government's policies to help the children by making medical care free all for all, which isn't even bad whether private or not. I mean, from my experience, most of the poor has enough food and clothes, trust me, so that's not the issue. Also, if this were the case, the middle-class would finally have peace. However, if not, help them. I mean, do you think they actually deserve to have a hard life simply because of this? <br>  <br>  Apparently, if the rich kept their money, bigger corporations would keep it all, and the taxes they have to pay are much less, and therefore, it doesn't generate enough to better the economy. That's exactly what's happening now. Also, how are they lazy when most wealthy people do nothing? I mean, sure enough, the wealthy person of the 1st generation made the money, but the other all inherited it.<br>  <br>  Therefore, when they run a company, they are the CEO, meaning they just sit around and boss their workers. To me, that's being lazy, whereas, people like my uncle, make really high amounts of money by doing construction, building the buildings the rich are lazing around it, and fixing the electrical circuits of which you use your computer. Also, believe it or not, the poor actually does more work than the contemporary wealthy because they need to do SOMETHING to stay alive.|`|ciT6oNLLaa	the thing is that some are born like twins or triplets but they usually dont keep on having babies if there broke.<br>  <br>  and i asked the same question to my mom when we were broke the same question... why when we were born she didnt give one of us away and she answered in three words...........I Love You...... i quess a mother that prays prays and prays have enough confidence to keep all there kids and pray to god for help and for me and my family it turned out just fine.... and hey i have a big family and now we live in a house and i love my life (Exept my step-dad but lets not get into that)<br>  <br>  i have 3 sisters and 2 brothers 16,im 13,10,8,4,1, so its preatty big<br>  <br>  i have to say it would be a better comunity but mothers will be heart broken to let there child go ......wouldnt you ?!?!|`|qx4F2SJmaa	No America would be better off economically if they closed their doors to illegal immigrants.  <br>  <br>  20,000,000 illegals are now here either working or living off the taxpayers like ME! <br>  <br>  Yes, those women who are having 5+ kids and getting all the assistance are usually illegals-|`|cmvum8YDaa	because the government lets them...it was all written...stupid ******* euros are greedy and evil...

Typically a single population becomes genetically isolated and evolves to become a new species. The other populations of the original species often stay the same. This happens because evolution has no long-term goal. It merely adapts populations to their environments.<br>  <br>  Third, the people saying we didn't evolve from apes actually mean to say we didn't evolve from apes that are alive today. We did evolve from apes.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	This is similar to saying, "if American colonists immigrated from England why are there still English?" We evolved from a common ancestor.

EYqTV2EYaa	I need more details. What exactly is a 'nerdface?' If you mean just plain nerds, well, remember it's just a label. It generally refers to people that want to participate in intellectual activity rather than physical and social. You never know, learning can be fun to some people, and they can generally dislike other things. As for me, I love learning, socializing, and some physical activity. What does that make me? Hehe, labels don't define me.|`|6d23830200d24363fd3bda7844f752bdaa	maybe you have the answer for that, since you are one.
hvIrXa9Gaa	Well, the German name for Jacob is Jakob, which is pronounced (YA-kob). However, unless you want "Jake" to have a German name/pronunciation, just leave it as "Jake".<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	These days, one typically just spells a name as it's used in the country of its origin and simply instructs it be pronounced according to the rules of that language. So, it would still just be Jake, and pronounced Jake.<br>  <br>  However, if this were the Renaissance or something, when it was common to modify a person's name and adapt it to the equivilent for whatever language was being spoken. Jakerl (Jakob plus the south-German diminutive) or something might be the closest you could get.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to try to spell it according to German rules but get the same pronunciation, Dschaek would be the spelling, I believe.|`|tONE51traa	Names stay the same in all languages.<br>  <br>  Like, my full name is Edmond.

AA10911602	You could always try Ebay. <br>  <br>  Now, I have a question for you. Let's say you have a friend and you meet them and they say to you "Great to see you, you look good. How are you. " You say "Thanks" And they reply "Great to see you, you look good. How are you." You think "strange" but say " Weather's been cold lately but I love the snow" They reply "Great to see you, you look good. How are you". Even stranger you think and reply "Are you feeling OK? How can I help you". This time they say " I saw your mother yesterday, she looks good to" Then this scene repeats itself again - except your replies differ and you soon stop listening.<br>  <br>  What is the point? Well, The Lord's prayer is a pattern of how to pray. Ween we repeat it over and over it becomes like the conversation above. God wants you to talk to Him in your words, telling Him your problems, desires and wishes. He wants you to tell Him that you love Him (if you do) and asking Him for help. <br>  <br>  The bible tells us that He does not like vain repetitions - He doesn't even listen.<br>  <br>  He wants a relationship with you and wants you to communicate with Him from your heart, not from a prayer book or a string of beads. Try it, you will be sueprised at ths results.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Probably your cheapest option is to make your own.  You can use beads or even tie knots in a string in place of beads.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|HQrqA2I1aa	shouldn't those things be free/ If i really cared about GOD, i wouldn't try to make a buck off his message (although it is very profitable, avg priest makes over 30k a year working one day a week!!!)
xxEhpytpaa	Yes, but if you go to confession and tell the priest this, the priest might say, you have to tell the police for your penance. If this is true and you don't your confession was for not.for we are under obligation to carry out our penance. How ever a priest,( if it hasn't happened yet), can warn the police of something that might take place. He doesn't have to revel the source, but if it happens, he can be hauled in for questioning and be held accountable for it. Tough question, and tough answer. But he is never suppose to revel where and who he heard it from, if it was confessed. God bless you.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	I think it is supposed to stay confidential but in reality it probably is not always the case.<br>  <br>  We are told to confess our sins to God. This can be done privately in our own room. No need for a third party for confession. You might appreciate a third party for advice on subjects to do with sins committed but fine details don't need to be given then.|`|cVPq3s9zaa	No exceptions, priest gets an automatic sentence to hell if he reveals anyone's confession.  It's a policy of the Catholic church.|`|i85Dui0maa	yes its no different then a psychiatrist .....they have to keep it confidence ...ad if you were gonna kill someone you wouldn't be confessing because you hadn't commited the sin yet|`|42pr8akBaa	A catholic priest cannot divulge ANY information he receives by act of confession.  If he did he would be removed from the priesthood and possibly excommunicated.  Most priests would never even think of doing such a thing, they take it very, very seriously|`|fWMzd7y5aa	He is to keep his mouth shut no matter how bad the confession is.

X3rt9ivEaa	No, they are separate things. I know a lot of people are saying that peace is a result of love, but can it also be the other way around. To truly love another, you must first love yourself...and loving yourself would bring you inner peace, therefore you can spread your love (and peace) to others. Just a thought.|`|sSjdtI7Eaa	No, love can endure turbulence, or not, peace can be shattered by love and the strong emotions it brings.  They are two completely different things.<br>  <br>  Love an emotion, love of family and friends or passionate it is still an emotional response.<br>  <br>  Peace, can be many things, no war, quiet, a restful meditative state it is a descriptive word as in peace of mind.<br>  <br>  I think the big L, rarely brings peace.  Emotions of a romantic nature are a double edged sword and the passion that fuels one can ultimately burn both.  It is fun to play with fire though.|`|C4miEeuYaa	No...I think peace is more like "at ease" or "calm"..Love is much different. It is a profoundly tender, passionate affection for someone or something. Now I DO think that love can cause peace. But I do not think they are at all the same thing.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	No but they come together<br>  you can still love and not be peaceful<br>  you can still hate and be peaceful<br>  but you can not have full peace if you have hate<br>  and you can have full love of you are not peacful|`|AA11935914	Love is not often very peaceful.

That's okay!<br>  <br>  How can peace and love be the same thing?  Let's say two countries have been at war for the past 10 years, slaughtering each other.  FINALLY they decide on a truce.  That truce is based solely on their mutual interests.  We'll stop killing your people and you stop killing ours.  So, they stop fighting.  Is that love?<br>  <br>  Canada and the US aren't at war (i.e., we have peace), but surely you don't think that we LOVE each other?<br>  <br>  My wife and I have been known to fight.  Yes, I do try very hard not to fight with her because I do love her and it strains our relationship, but even when we're fighting, I still love her.  And when we stop fighting, I don't love her any more.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but you get the idea.  Love is a FEELING that lives within the heart and mind.  Peace is nothing more than an absence of conflict.  Peace can come to be out of ... cowardice, self interest, etc.  Peace has nothing to do with love, unless ... you truly--and I mean TRULY--tie the two together.  Example: I say that I love my wife sooooooooooo much that I refuse to every fight with her again.  Or a country says, "We love God so much that we refuse to ever fight again."  That kind of peace through love is rare if not completely unknown.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	No, but peace might be brought about through love.|`|UinOWcMUaa	They are by-products of each otehr but not the same :) Peace is a mental frame of mind, but LOVE is so much more, though they do tie hand in hand !!|`|pGf4mIw9aa	No. Because the only time I get peace is when the person I love is gone.|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's not the same thing.

3BHPJweWaa	i call Her "Goddess Sophia" -- "Mother of the All"... and "Beloved" most of the time.<br>  <br>  <smile><br>  <br>  According to the translator's introduction to the Peshitta (a translation of the Bible from the Aramaic version) Yeshua (speaking Aramaic) called his Heavenly Father by the name "Alaha".<br>  <br>  *That* has an appealing sound to me.  It has a mellow flow to it -- with a hint of child-like *laughter* & good humor.<br>  <br>  Sri Aurobindo, writing about God, once said:<br>  <br>  "What is God afterall?  An eternal child playing an eternal game in an eternal garden.<br>  <br>  "The universe is...the delight of a Self-lover, the play of a Child, the endless self-multiplication of a Poet intoxicated with the rapture of His own power of endless creation.<br>  <br>  "...the Supreme...we should speak of Him as if He were a lover, a musician of universal and particular harmonies, a child, a poet...<br>  <br>  "If Idea embracing Force begot the worlds, Delight of Being begot the Idea.  Because the Infinite conceived an innumerable delight in itself, therefore worlds and universes came into existence.<br>  <br>  "Consciousness of being and Delight of being are the first parents.  Also, they are the last transcendence.<br>  <br>  "Unconsciousness is only an intermediate swoon of the conscious or its obscure sleep; pain and self-extinction are only delight of being running away from itself in order to find itself elsewhere or otherwise.<br>  <br>  "Delight of being is not limited in Time; it is without end or beginning.  God comes out from one form of things only to enter into another."                  <br>  <br>  --Sri Aurobindo, "Thoughts & Glimpses"<br>  <br>  Sophia once told me, "God never spoke but with lips of gentle laughter."  Certainly the Naming, "Alaha" captures the essence of that, for me.<br>  <br>  "Jehovah" is such a harshly, arrogantly *judgemental* kind of name, to the way i "hear" it (probably because of the tone with which my Jehovah's Witness brother has spoken it so often in my presence).  i next-to *loathe* that particular name for "God".  "Jah" & "Yah!" are just too *abrupt* to my taste.  & "Allah" carries connotations of all that fanatical *violence* on the part of some Islamics -- & thruout Islam's history (of chopping off people's heads for not converting -- or an Islamic *wife's* head -- in New York City, just a few days ago) -- so that particular Naming carries unpleasant associations for me.<br>  <br>  i usually just call Him "Father"... & sometimes "Alaha!" -- as i perceive Yeshua as having done.<br>  <br>  But i'm *far* more focussed on the Divine Energy as being Our Heavenly Mother, since about 1995.<br>  <br>  The Omnipresent Divine Energy of Living Spirit Whose Presence enwraps every one of us in Divine Love is not concerned about what personal Name we call H/er or It!  <br>  <br>  Only fanatical religious believers caught up in the subtle abstract *idolatry* of certain syllables as being the "only True Name of God" are going to be concerned about such an issue -- which only *reveals* their own idolatry of particular human *sounds* (& particular books) -- to others!<br>  <br>  What are birds calling the Divine in their morning canticle to the dawn?<br>  <br>  "Arthur" doesn't work real well for me, personally (it makes me think of my cousin, Arthur... & King Arthur of round table mythological fame) -- but if it works for *you* -- then *fine*! Presumably it would personalize your relationship with the Divine, begetting a feeling of a more friendly *closeness* rather than feeling so *distant* from He/r.<br>  <br>  & if calling "God" by the name of "Arthur" helps get a few other people out of their own repetitious *ruts* -- then that's surely a Good Thing!<br>  <br>  i, myself, get weary of the locked-in theological connotations that go with the word "God".  There's just a lot of belief-baggage that seems pretty intrinsic to the use of that word, across the centuries, that i really don't believe, myself.  So to call the Awesome Mysterious All by the word "God" seems to me to *diminish* Her Mystery & Her exciting *allure*!<br>  <br>  Is it *wiser* for people to choose their own name for the Divine?<br>  <br>  Could well be!  If *everyone* had a uniquely personal name for the Divine, this *should* beget wider *tolerance* -- rather than reinforcing dogmatic religious conformative *intolerance*!|`|RNNsvSh9aa	erm Yahwe?|`|EKP72H7Vaa	hai,<br>             first  of  all  believe  in  GOD   and  respect  him.

suSWUm5Jaa	Learning the French language on-line is possible ... so long as you commit yourself to working on it regularly, at least 20 minutes a day (as opposed to studying it 3 or 4 hours once a week). Remember, repetition (or practice) is the mother of skills. I do not mean to lecture you but I had to say it :-).<br>  <br>  There are many ecourses, online videos, online audios, exercises and many more resources all at your disposal on the internet.<br>  <br>  First, you can learn French on-line with podcasts or any such type of recordings that are readily available at many websites. All you have to do is a search on Google with keywords related to "podcast" and you'll be able to locate a great number of podcasts for your own learning pleasure. <br>  If you would like to have more up-to-date information, you can tune into on-line radio stations and listen to the news or music (go to the French version of the major search engines: yahoo.fr etc ...). If you have a fast internet connection, you can also watch TV online. <br>  <br>  Another simple way to learn French on-line is to practice speaking with native speakers who happen to be learning English. You can communicate with them by using instant messaging applications, most notably MSN messenger. You can also talk to them directly using softwares like Skype or any other VOIP (Voice Over IP) applications.<br>  There are many different language exchange communities on the internet where you can find partners according to your needs. Simply do a search on any major search engines with the keyword "language exchange", and you should be able to find quickly your first partner for learning French.<br>  <br>  Thanks to thousands of language enthusiasts, there are tons of carefully constructed lessons on-line and you can learn for free at your own convenience. Do another simple search for French courses and you're bound to find countless of them out there to assist you to get up to speed quickly.<br>  <br>  If you need a well-structured, organized teaching (or as a complement to the aforementioned solutions), you may want to consider Rocket French. You may or may not "learn to speak French confidently in less than 8 weeks" as advertised but my best friend told me that it worked wonderfully for her ( <a href="http://www.rocketfrenchlanguage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocketfrenchlanguage.com/</a> ). She quickly reached a comfort level enabling her to have conversations with French people (even on the phone, actually) thanks to that program.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of ways to get on-line exposure to the French language. Of course, nothing beats IMMERSION :-) - I became fluent in foreign languages living abroad. But like I said before, with commitment and consistent effort, you will reach your goals. <br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy the process!|`|Tn1bMQ3Aaa	self study is a great way to get a heads up for a formal class..<br>  <br>  Free lesson videos from French in action-- Old school but actually still used in various colleges.. <a href="http://www.learner.org/resources/series83.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learner.org/resources/series8...</a><br>  <br>  Learn as many nouns with articles Le/La as you can while waiting for the class..<br>  <br>  When learning adj, adverbs, prepositions... make sure you put all definitions.. do not restrict yourself to one definition. Many of these have multiple meanings which are and will be used. It may not make sense without  having classes... but when you encounter it in class it will already be burned into your mind.<br>  <br>  I would practice verb conjugation in the present, passe compose, imparfait, and furture..  It will make it easier for you if you're not stressing over this aspect while learning more difficult material.<br>  Of course there will be additional tenses, but once you get the hang of the conjugation.. others will be easy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://french.about.com/od/lessons/ss/checklist_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://french.about.com/od/lessons/ss/ch...</a><br>  This link is for a do-it-yourself course.<br>  Scroll down and you can go to the next weeks lessons..

Immerse yourself in the culture when at home, try saying words you learn in French aloud, and my favorite thing is take whatever you are thinking of saying and translate it into French.

You have to actively be learning and put effort into it.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I would recommend that you take a class. But if you can't Pimsleur French is pretty good. It is expensive but rather effective if you do it everyday as recommended and do not move on until you have retained at least 70%.

Also, I don't think it is effective at all. This French girl came to my high school for a year as an exchange student, she spoke amazingly good English, but she couldn't understand songs sung in English for the life of her.

(However, it was not the first time that spectrum or rainbow colors had been associated with gay and lesbian people.[citation needed]) It has been suggested that Baker was inspired by Judy Garland's singing "Over The Rainbow".[3] The flag consisted of eight stripes; Baker assigned specific meaning to each of the colours as follows:<br>  <br>  hot pink: sexuality   (Not on the flag anymore)<br>  red: life <br>  orange: healing <br>  yellow: sunlight <br>  green: nature <br>  turquoise: magic/art  (Not on the flag anymore)<br>  indigo: serenity/harmony <br>  violet: spirit|`|OD0Yq1Haaa	Αξιοθ?ατα<br>  Αγ?πη<br>  Φιλ?α<br>  Φ?λο<br>  Φιλι?<br>  Μ?σο?<br>  Σχ?σει?|`|7aK81hsbaa	the diversity of our community and freedom to express that joyously.

bCgW89MLaa	There is no defending or excusing this at all!  I hope that Chris Brown's career tanks, unfortunatly there are people out there who think that this kind of behavior is excusable if the man is hot, or teaching her a lesson, or in love.  <br>  I hope that his punishment will fit his crime...  let him get a good beat down!|`|DHzwr1braa	I can admit that I was defending Chris Brown because all the media information that I seen was speculation and assumptions. Now that the REAL picture of her has surfaced I have a different feeling about this whole situation. I feel bad for both Chris and Rihanna there very young. I hope they both learn from this situation. Chris needs to seek counseling.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree that the herpes story was just a rumor. I hope Rihanna makes a statement soon.|`|P3BwONTlaa	I never said that I was defending him and that is horrible.  Rihanna is a beautiful young lady so how can you beat on a face like that.  Well things happen, what's shocking to me is that they are saying that they are considering getting back together.  Its just stupid to me that she would want to be with a person that potentionally battered her face to a pulp|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	Jesus, uh, I mean, Obama. Damn. Thats effed up. I always knew that chris brown was no good. She gave him herpes? Bahahahahahahahaha! Guess she really was a good girl gone bad. I can kinda understand him being mad at her if she did give him an STD but there is no reason to beat someone up like that. That guy deserves to go to prison. The herpes thing is also his fault, he should have used a rubber.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	I think this indecent parallels the culture of today.

People ask yourselfs questions before you just start jumping to all kinds of conclusions.|`|bf78cb2f1cf4fcc62a4faeff083a9a52aa	I think the only people who can feel ok about defending him are people who don't realize that they are potential (if they aren't already) victims or attackers of this kind of abuse. It's sad either way. Boy needs criminal charges and his career done and quick.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Before this incident I always liked Chris Brown and thought he was one of the good guys. Now I'll never be able to look at him or hear his music without thinking about what he did to Rihanna.<br>  <br>  There is NO excuse good enough for him to have beaten her like he did and the people who try to excuse him make me sick. No man should ever lay his hands on a woman like that, especially not the woman he's supposed to love.<br>  <br>  Chris has said he's sorry and he's getting counseling. I really hope he is getting help so that he never does something this horrible again.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Who was defending him?|`|OR8hrr0aaa	You don't know what she didn't provoke it, you don't know her personally, sure he went way too far and should take a punishement like a ordinary person but don't assume that she's off polishing her halo, i have sympathy for her but not to the point where im gonna rant and rave about chris brown being a jackass, let the law deal with him.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I do think that what he did was horrible, and that was one brutal photo.  I would never defend a guy who does that and I don't worship him.  Although it's true that we don't know the whole story.

pbsrCPRAaa	A huge change occurs...darkness to light, death to life....it will manifest itself over time to different degrees but a change will occur and it will be a big one...|`|3WYcPsm4aa	It depends upon what kind of change you're looking for.  When my hubby was baptized, not much about him really changed.  He was a great guy before and was a great guy afterward.  Yes, he started reading the bible more and attending confirmation class.  He also started attending bible studies with me.  But, as for an outward change that anyone could notice... not really.<br>  <br>  Inside... I'm sure there was some sort of a change.  But, I've never asked and he's never offered.  The most important change, of course, was that he realized that God had chosen him long ago, and that at his baptism he became a child of God.  But, his faith and the Holy Spirit had been there all along, waiting to finally be "heard" by him.|`|PmaB839Naa	I have seen two things happen.

You may appear different, but you are still poluted.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	They exponentially start to lose critical thinking skills and brain functionality.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Yes, their brain shrivels up and dies.|`|s2TJ6H1raa	they loose sanity|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Yes a change happens, We become a new creature in Christ.|`|CThuHfV3aa	The Bible tells us we will change for the better. And If they do not, They are not the Children of God. I went from a Partier (Drugs, Alcohol and Sex) To none of it. I still slip and sin but I am only human and I try not to be stupid.|`|VncSMLMpaa	We should change because we should be baptised. This is all about repenting and wanting to go God's way in our lives, to be faithful.<br>  <br>  When we are baptised the idea is that as when a garment is dyed we go down into the water and come up to newness of life. As with the dye we have to go into that water to come up entirely new as with a fresh colour. Just as Jesus died and rose again we die to the old way of life and follow Jesus.<br>  <br>  This is wonderful as we have such an example as Jesus who was selfless, always teaching others and healing those who came to him, even when the religious authorities accused him of breaking the sabbath.<br>  <br>  What we believe has to influence the way we live our lives and how we relate to others. We want others to share what we have found, that is the gospel of salvation. We cannot earn salvation but we should live our lives in such a way that we reflect the way Jesus showed.|`|ma0u2CUNaa	when someone becomes born again, old things are passed away the begin to grow away from thier old sinful nature and start growing in the Lord|`|UARQA0CLaa	When one fully understands that Jesus was crucified for their sins, and that he died and that he rose on the third day they have genuine sorrow and they want to make a change.  He/She realized that they are sinners and that sin separates them from God.  In order to receive forgiveness, they must obey the Gospel.  When this sorrow is felt, it brings about a change in their attitude/heart and they want to stop sinning.  The fact that they are willing to confess Christ's name and repent (turn away) from their sins comes from their understanding.  Once they understand all this then they are baptized for the remission of sin.  At this time they live their lives in obedience to God's will.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes -- One is born again :) It's kind of uniquevexperience in a sense it's like your eye's become open.. and you see things in a whole new perspective.

UkKEvilYaa	That whole passage v 25-28 Paul is telling us that we need to train up ourselves to follow God's word. That we cannot just talk the talk we have to walk the walk. Paul used physical  metaphors all the time. He is saying tat we need to spend time in God;s gym exercising our spiritual muscle.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Paul is speaking about keeping his body away from the sinful desires of the flesh. No longer being a slave to sin.....but rather, a slave to Christ.<br>  <br>  Here's the NIV version:<br>  "No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize"<br>  <br>  Here's a good commentary:<br>  27. keep under--literally, "bruise the face under the eyes," so as to render it black and blue; so, to chastise in the most sensitive part. Compare "mortify the deeds of the body," Romans 8:13; also 1 Peter 2:11. It is not ascetic fasts or macerations of the body which are here recommended, but the keeping under of our natural self-seeking, so as, like Paul, to lay ourselves out entirely for the great work. <br>  my body--the old man and the remainders of lust in my flesh. "My body," so far as by the flesh it opposes the spirit [ESTIUS] (Galatians 5:17). Men may be severe to their bodies and yet indulge their lust. Ascetic "neglect of the body" may be all the while a more subtile "satisfying of the flesh" (Colossians 2:23). Unless the soul keep the body under, the body will get above the soul. The body may be made a good servant, but is a bad master.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	Exactly what the other answerer said!  It's Paul's acknowledgment that we are CONSTANTLY under the threat of giving in to the temptation of sin.  Here he's preaching the gospel then saying, I need to be careful or I'll miss out myself.<br>  <br>  Good advice for all.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	It talks about obedience to God's word in reference to sinning.|`|n55igpCUaa	If you take it literally, it means don't feed yourself to slaves... meaning don't give food to the needy. Makes alot of sense... that's where fundies come from!|`|gHSarVD1aa	Sin will poison you. The flesh wars against the spirit. We feed the spirit and starve the flesh. Paul is saying that he does not want to end up like Moses. Unable to enter into the promised land. So he does whatever it takes to control his fleshly nature to sin. It is consistent with Jesus teaching in Matthew 5 about cutting off the hand that offends.

Different ones and different meds never seem to work. I found out I had to move and get away from what I was surrounded with that pulled me out of depression. <br>  I believe a lot of times we have to experience to learn from life. Sometimes just look around us to see what is bothering us and change for the better. That way we can grow/or help others in their time of need.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."    -- Matthew 11:28-30<br>  <br>  <br>  He wants you let go and give it ALL up to HIM.  HE has promised you rest, peace and contentment when you cease striving and allow HIM to dwell within you!  I know this is true because HE did it for me!  I, too, suffer from depression and have had some very low times in my life.  I have peace today because I found that just keeping my mind and spirit focused on HIM makes all the difference.  I also realized that those times when I was depressed, I was staying focused on myself and my struggle, instead of letting go and allowing HIM to work things out for me.  I know HE will do the same for you, if you let HIM!   <br>  <br>  Read HIS Word, find your peace from the promises contained there.  HE promised to take good care of us.  <br>  <br>  "Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life[b]? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? <br>   "Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. <br>  <br>   "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom."<br>  --Luke 12:22-32<br>  <br>  HE WILL fulfill HIS promise for you too!

You are not a failure in any light.  You know the most successful people fail all the time.  They keep making the same mistakes over and over again and eventually they figure out what they really want.  <br>  <br>  Suicide is not an option when you have so much to live for and it is not a matter that God does not love you or me, but you do have to take a step back and see if you are actually planning things out or just working hard for nothing.  <br>  <br>  When I was in school, the hardest part was not writing 3-5 papers a week, the hardest part was planning it just right so that I could actually enjoy my Saturdays, instead of, working all day Saturdays.  If I planned it out I could do the research one day, outline the papers the next day, and have all my references cited in APA format by Thursday. On Friday, I wrote most of the papers and then on Saturday morning I was able to review the papers before submitting them making sure that the Flesch-Kincaid Reading was above 21 or at least a 13 grade level.  LOL! Most of the time the week would pass by so quickly, I was working full-time and doing my best to stick to the schedule.  I seriously thought sometimes, I was a failure.  It was difficult to stick to the schedule.  The funny thing is that I had an academic advisor who never gave up on me.  She would ask me all the time what I needed and if I asked for more time, she said absolutely but now you have to double up.  I think sometimes working out things, we are forcing ourselves to play catch-up, to double-up.  It is okay to give yourself more time.  That's not being a failure, that's actually being smart.  That's actually apart of planning it all out.  You do what you have to do but I say give it more time. Allow yourself that at least and I think you will be just fine.|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	I'm not an atheist, but I'll answer your question too.<br>  <br>  If by "I don't get anywhere in life" you mean that you aren't rich with a beautiful wife, a house and a big shiny car, then you need to reassess the difference between eternity and 70-80 years. If your reason for seeking God is to get these things, then it will only get worse.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by "work hard"? Are you working hard at your job, or working hard at some religious ritual?<br>  <br>  If you seek God in prayer, and read the Bible earnestly, even though you might not get any revelation straight away, you will get your answers and your breakthrough.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend going too youtube and searching 'paul washer'.

Do I still struggle with anxiety or depression?  Absolutely, but now I turn to God with such instances. <br>  <br>  Two books that really help me get a better understanding on my relationship with God and the influence of the Devil on our lives are written by C.S.

I been through a lot myself to where I thought at a point in time " God is not listening to me and he doesn't care, because if he did then I would not be going through this" But then I had to come out of that and think of everything that he had brought me from. Because you trust and believe in God you will have life. You can't let things get you down (WEEPiNG MY ENDURE F0R A NiGHT BUT J0Y C0METH iN THE M0RNiNG) You have to just keep your head your head up and believe that God is able, he is only testing you! And once you get through your test everything is going to be alright! Please don't give up on Jesus! Continue to do good and good will come to you! Everything is going to be alright! <br>  God will forgive you for all your sins ( Matthew 26:28): "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out of many for the forgiveness of sins"<br>  You will have joy (Deuteronomy 16:15) For the LORD your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS !

I can't help but feel someone (or everyone) failed that child in his time of need.  Was he abused by his father and the other man?  Looks like we will never know.  All I can think of is we should do what is best for society and offer that child psychiatric care and keep him under close supervision for as many years as possible.  If his mental condition proves unstable then he should be placed in an appropriate facility.  Allowing him to continue his life as before the murders isn't possible.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	This is where I have a lot of trouble with the whole concept of gun ownership and availability in the US.

On the other hand, what would possess a 14 year old to choose a (permanent solution to a temporary problem) by jumping out of a window to his death?  <br>  <br>  So many of today's very young are filled with rage & despondency.  It's on us if we, as parents, do not see the warning signs.  They are there, however subtle they may be.  But, it's a parent's responsibility to be  "in touch" with their children on every level.  Too many parents today are too wrapped up in their own lives, and allow their children to fend for themselves emotionally.  This is their formative years - so form them!<br>  <br>  I don't know about you, but I can sense when something is not right with each & every person I love, child or adult.<br>  <br>  A plea bargain may be the immediate answer, but it certainly is not a cure-all for the rest of this child's life.

As stated in the article, we will never know what led up to this tragedy.  I think there is a dark reason why they are not revealing the motivation behind it.  But because of his age, I do believe putting him in a juvenile facility will  not make things better for him as punishment.  Those places are breeding grounds for learning more criminal activity later on.  So yes the plea bargain was appropriate IMHO.  I only hope that the child gets some serious counseling as he is heading for the preteen stage of his life.  Perhaps he should be on probation for life.  Very tough call.|`|jjt2enntaa	I think we need to know the thought  process of this 8 year old so maybe we can prevent this from happening again.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, this child will someday realize the full impact of his crime,  that will probably be punishment enough.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Once upon a time I was eight years old and my Dad had a closet full of guns and a desk drawer full of pistols.

SSsCOIrqaa	The Bible, like most literary works of that period, is full of imagery and symbolism.  The particular passage you quoted is relating someone's image of God.  I think it's dangerous to assume that since we're "made in God's image" that this means God looks like us physically.  It more likely means we have his attributes in a spiritual and ethical sense than a physical one.  I think God operates on a much higher plane than we can possibly imagine in our physically constrained existence, but we try to explain and rationalize him and make him fit in our box regardless.  The Bible writers did their best to portray God with their limited language and imagery, but I have to believe He is far greater and more powerful than we could even imagine.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	sure, metaphorical feet don't smell.|`|zBqt99avaa	Not the strongest argument, but basically, these descriptions of God are said to be how the human mind perceived Him.

LjsRfaskaa	There was no such thing as the bible as we know it, until the last emperor of Rome created it. The old testament is from the Jewish tradition and they say it is not to be taken literally. The old testament is in ancient Hamitic, a language that has no vowel's. The Genesis creation story originates from ancient Ur, Sommerland. That is written in cuneiform. A language based on series of triangles and lines pressed into soft clay tablets. It is easy to understand how mistranslations can creep into such works when it is translated from one dying language to another. <br>  <br>  The new testament was from a very small sect which was becoming popular among the Romans after the plague hit in Constantinople. The plague killed half the population, they thought it was the end of the world. The emperor lost his wife to it, but he was one of the rare people who recovered and survived. Unfortunately he was an evil despot before the plague and then he went insane. <br>  <br>  He desperately wanted to recreate the old Roman empire to its former glory, so on the back of  the plague he sent his armies throughout Europe murdering anyone who disagreed with him. Using the newly formed Christian religion as a weapon to convert of die. He ordered the libraries of Alexandria to be burnt, setting mankind back millenia. He wanted general ignorance. There is a reason why the head of the Christian faith was and is in Rome. <br>  <br>  He managed to convert Europe easily because of its weakened state after half of the population dying from the plague, there were no armies left to fight him off. From his point of view it was the perfect time to take it over and put it back under Roman authority.<br>  <br>  Then Christianity hit the northern Celts who would not convert despite being half dead from the plague. They were and remain a feisty lot. lol. There is a reason why Hadrian built a wall deviding England from Scotland. They destroyed all the sacred circles and planted ugly buildings on the sites to stop them from being used. When that did not work they plagiarized all their festivals, dates and all. All they did was to substitute Jesus instead of the Sun as the messiah, ie as per the Celtic Cross. <br>  <br>  When that did not work they tortured, raped, stole, and murdered by burning people alive. Like my g.g.g.g.grandmother who was a healer. A sweet little old lady helping the sick was such an abomination that she needed to be burnt alive. <br>  <br>  Of course after several generations of this, who is left but mostly ignorant Christian converts and a few disbelievers who have fled underground. Hence the start of the dark ages.<br>  <br>  That is how Christianity became the most wide spread religion, on the back of disease, war fare and crime by an insane despot wanting to keep control. <br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman,... quantum physics rocks.|`|zkovxRseaa	God didn't write the Bible, it was written by some drunk power hungry men looking to control their primitive masses|`|RNNsvSh9aa	why should it be either ALL right or ALL wrong?<br>  <br>  thats absurd. there are some true parts, some wrong parts and some devoid of meaning.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	You didn't state where you got your information.There is Nabonid and Nabonidus but no Nabonide,you have ot remember that there were 2 Kings named Nebachadnezzer to differentiate them they were 1rst and 2nd .Just like men today are named after their fathers sometimes3 or 4 times and causes a lot of confusion we have to know which one we are talking about.“<br>  <br>  In contradiction to this report, the Babylonian Chronicle stated that on the 20th of Tebet, Sennaherib, king of Assyria, was killed by his son in a revolt. Thus, he was assassinated by only one of his sons. The same account was given by Berossus and Nabonid. With respect to this event of first rate significance for Babylonian-Assyrian history all indications seemed to be that the Babylonian records were more reliable than the Biblical ones. However, the fact is that the opposite is true. In a more recently discovered fragment of the prism of Esarhaddon, he reports himself that his brothers revolted and slew Sennaherib, their father, to gain the kingship. Before he could reach them in Nineveh, they fled from there to unknown parts.<br>  <br>  “The Babylonian Chronicle, Nabonid, and Berossus were mistaken; only the Biblical account proved to be correct. It was confirmed in all the minor details by the inscription of Esarhaddon and proved to be more accurate regarding this event of Babylonian-Assyrian history than the Babylonian sources themselves. This is a fact of utmost importance for the evaluation of even contemporary sources not in accord with Biblical tradition.”<br>  <br>  NEBUCHADNEZZAR<br>  <br>  (Neb?u?chad?nez′zar), Nebuchadrezzar (Neb?u?chad?rez′zar) [from Akkadian, meaning “O Nebo, Protect the Heir!”].<br>  <br>  Second ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire; son of Nabopolassar and father of Awil-Marduk (Evil-merodach), who succeeded him to the throne. Nebuchadnezzar ruled as king for 43 years (624-582?B.C.E.), this period including the “seven times” during which he ate vegetation like a bull. (Da 4:31-33) To distinguish this monarch from the Babylonian ruler by the same name but of a much earlier period (the Isin dynasty), historians refer to him as Nebuchadnezzar II.<br>  <br>  Historical notices in cuneiform inscriptions presently available about Nebuchadnezzar somewhat supplement the Bible record. They state that it was in the 19th year of Nabopolassar’s reign that he assembled his army, as did his son Nebuchadnezzar, then crown prince. Both armies evidently functioned independently, and after Nabopolassar went back to Babylon within a month’s time, Nebuchadnezzar successfully warred in mountainous territory, later returning to Babylon with much spoil. During the 21st year of Nabopolassar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar marched with the Babylonian army to Carchemish, there to fight against the Egyptians. He led his forces to victory. This took place in the fourth year of Judean King Jehoiakim (625?B.C.E.).—Jer 46:2.<br>  <br>  The inscriptions further show that news of his father’s death brought Nebuchadnezzar back to Babylon, and on the first of Elul (August-September), he ascended the throne. In this his accession year he returned to Hattu, and “in the month Shebat [January-February, 624?B.C.E.] he took the vast booty of Hattu to Babylon.” (Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles,|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Because the Bible was written by people, in case you missed that little hint that has been lingering around, I'll spell it out for you.<br>  <br>  No the Bible was not written by God, it was written by men who claimed that God spoke the word to them.

Even the account of creation and the fall of man as written in the Book of Genesis is still subject to further clarifications but the message behind is about obedience to the law by man.<br>  The Book also about Noah and the forty days and nights of rains and flood was mentioned only as  seven days in the Book of Gilgamesh. Written stories by many writers of the Books may have based their works on hear says and interpretations from what was inscribed in tablets and walls or parchments. There are many accounts in the Bible that oftentimes were found somewhat extracted from Ancient Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts and writings and even has some similarities from the Old Mayan Texts.<br>  Just because of those errors does not necessarily prove  the Book of God is not right. We have to look at what is the real intention of the Book for mankind. There is a teaching or Commandment that says 'Thou Shall not Kill", would it mean that because it was not Nebuchadnezzar but his son in-law Nabonite who was the mentioned King of Babylon in the time of Dante no longer the right Commandment?<br>  Everything that the Books have written may not have the entire truth about it but what is right about it is that it teaches man to spend his life in righteousness and justice.|`|hQDapmICaa	2Ti 3:15  And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <br>  <br>  2Ti 3:16  All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: <br>  <br>  2Ti 3:17  That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. <br>  <br>  It can get you to HEAVEN, if you are worthy!<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|uO0knmZOaa	THE BIBLE Vs QUR’AN-HADITH<br>  The Bible<br>  The Bible comprises:<br>  1. God’s statements (at times printed in red)<br>  2. Prophets’/Apostles’ traditions and<br>  3. The report of events of Biblical times<br>  In Islam, the ‘God’s statements (Qur’an) is completely separated from the ”Prophet’s/Apostles’ traditions”.<br>  Muslims’ Ignorance<br>  It is a pity that Muslims, who mistakenly imagine the Holy Bible to be like the Qur’an, quote the ‘reports’ and ‘traditions’ parts of the Bible in their efforts to proof that “the Bible is contradictory etc and therefore it is not God’s statements” instead of them to quote the Biblical God’s statements. Nevertheless, their arguments are normally simplistic. <br>  The Hadith<br>  It should be noted that Hadith, the Islamic equivalent of the portion of the Bible often capitalised upon by the Muslims, is the most contradictory and controversial book on Earth.<br>  In the Hadith, to virtually every story or law there are radical or contradictory versions. <br>  Qur’an/Hadith<br>  Though successive revisions and corrections of the Qur’an have made it more consistent than Hadith, even Uthmanic version, the last version of the Qur’an, has created more questions than answers and left so many vital questions unanswered. Thus more fabrications and plagiarisms aimed at complementing even this last version of the Qur’an were made and added, not to the Qur’an as would have been preferred but, to the Hadith because the Qur’an had erstwhile been publicly declared as haven been perfectly completed.<br>  Consequently the Hadith, which is supposed to solely be Traditions of Muhammad (Interpretation of the Qur’an) exceeds its scope such that it contains, in addition to Quranic elements:<br>  i. Some big pre-Islamic stories/religious laws that are not traceable to the Qur’an and were logically plagiarised from the Bible and para- phrased. <br>  ii. Some stories/religious laws that are by their virtue, supposed to be divine revelations and, therefore, originate from the Qur’an, but are curiously, not traceable to the Qur’an.<br>  Examples of Hadth Exceeding its Scope (including Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih al-Muslim)<br>  i. Hadis-al-Qudsi (supposed Allah’s statements), which are not traceable to the Qur’an.<br>  ii. The Second Coming of Jesus (and some funny details), which are not traceable to the Qur’an.<br>  iii. How to pray in Islam which, you may not believe it, is not traceable to Allah’s statements (Qur’an).<br>  iv. The coming of the Dijjal on the Last Day and the reversed movement of the Sun by then, which is not from Qur’an.<br>  v. Some additional sexually incredible stories of the said Paradise gift damsels (Hurul-in) and many other materials that are supposed to have been originally stated by Allah but are curiously not traceable to the Qur’an.<br>  Indisputable Evidences of Corruption of The Qur’an<br>  The evidences of mutilations even in the current (Uthmanic) version of the Qur’an include the following:<br>  a. ALIF. LAM. MIN (which has been rendered meaningless by wrongful removal of some connective letters or words)<br>  b. KAF. YA. A. IN. SAD ” ”<br>  c. TA. SIN ” ”<br>  d. ALIF. LAM. MIN. SAD ” ”<br>  e. TA. SIN. MIN ” ”<br>  f. ALIF. LAM. RA. ” ”<br>  g. ALIF. LAM. MIN. RA etc etc. These evident corruptions occurred more than thirty (30) times in the Qur’an. What is clear is that God could not have made such meaningless statements. And if He did Prophet Muhammad would logically have asked Him (God) their meanings.<br>  The So-called Variant Readings of the Qur’an (actually various versions of the Qur’anic verses and phrases)<br>  Let me start from the Islamic sources themselves. According to ‘wise’ Islamic Scholars, the reason for these various versions is that, “When Qur’an was collated and compiled, the scribes and copyists wrote the text without using any diacritical points or marks. They relied on their familiarity with the text for correct reading. However, with passage of time the readers of the Qur’an faced difficulties in this respect and they came to read and understand the verses in ways that differed slightly from one another”. See AL-TAWHID, 1990 Vol. vii, no. 3 page 41. (P.O. Box 14155, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran).<br>  The AL-TAWHID stated that versions of fourteen (14) reciters were originally chosen of which seven (7) have been considered the ‘mutawatir’ (most reliable), three as ‘ahad’ and the other four as ’shadhah’.<br>  AL-TAWHID adds, “Some like Jalal al-din al-Balqini, have accepted this classification while some like al-Suyuti consider the tawatur’ (authenticity) of the seven readers as doubtful for the following reasons:-<br>  i. Because they have been transmitted through ‘Akhbar ahad’.<br>  ii. Because some of the seven qurra (readers) were not reliable (muwaththaq) as narrators.<br>  iii. Because those qira’at (readings) depended on subjective judgement (ra’y) and persona|`|45ef8ccda7bdd1f20216d7d9a81d77dcaa	Pure & Simple : P R E T Z E L - L O G I C.<br>  <br>  Tampered HEAVILY - No One who wrote in<br>  the Bible ever even met Christ - Leading Scientists<br>  Biblical - Anthropological Scholars have proven this<br>  in Recent Years.<br>  <br>  John the Divine - in His Time - announced that over 50% of <br>  His Writings were LOST shortly after He left the Isle of Patmos.<br>  Today known as REVELATIONS. . . . in the so called :<br>  Holy Scriptures.

Suppose you are transmitting a message over the radio to some guy in a hut in Antarctica (who has always lived there). The guy only has a primitive radio set. The message sometimes comes through clear but is sometimes garbled. Also the fact that the guy knows only about snow, penguins and stuff like that, makes it difficult for him to understand the message in the first place. The guy in Antarctica writes down the message as well as he can, but sometimes he gets it wrong. Then it is laboriously written down and copied over and over for many generations. Finally someone decides to translate it into different languages and publish it in a book. Would it be surprising if it contained some mistakes, inconsistencies, and plain wrong stuff, as well as parts of the original message?|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	It doesn't really matter how right or wrong the bible is. <br>   What matters most is that we get right with God!<br>  There will come a time when we will not be able to.|`|KXyTkIbAaa	What big and tasty guy said.

She had more than two sons.  She had a multitude of children and that is where their wives came from.

Call it sick if you want, it is obviously beyond a lot of people's understanding<br>  They lived back then to be over 7,8 or 900 years old,  That would have been generations of families.

It does not say they were the only ones he created, and we should probably assume he also made a whole race.<br>  <br>  In fact, if you read further on in the Bible, Adam's son Cain travels to the Land of Nod, where he marries a woman, and founds a city.<br>  <br>  Presumably God had populated this land, Nod, with people, and the wife of Cain was one of these. Its the only way you can explain how Cain, first son of Adam, could found a whole city!<br>  <br>  If it was just Cain and his wife and their son the best they could found would be a farm not a city.<br>  <br>  If you compare Greek myth, the first man Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha were told by the Gods to populate the earth by casting stones over their shoulders which were turned into men and women. The couples own children and descendants became the first kings of these people.<br>  I assume the Bible is similar, with Adam's descendants becoming the rulers of all the tribes of men which God had created after Adam.|`|GdXOjRNmaa	The story of Adam & Eve was probably meant as a spiritual "parable" and not to be taken literally.

Rather, it shows that he returns in the sense of turning his attention to the earth and to accomplish certain definite purposes respecting mankind.<br>  <br>  Christ’s descending, as mentioned at 1?Thessalonians 4:16, is in the same sense as the Scriptures speak of God’s descending to earth. For instance, the Bible says of God: “He proceeded to bend the heavens down and to descend; and thick gloom was beneath his feet.” (2?Samuel 22:10) “Look! Jehovah is going forth from his place, and he will certainly come down and tread upon earth’s high places.” (Micah 1:3) What is meant by these words? Not that God will leave his place in heaven, but that he will turn his attention to affairs on earth.<br>  <br>  In the same way, when Christ turns his attention to the earth he resurrects those sleeping in death who will join him in heavenly rule. (1?Thessalonians 4:14, 15; Revelation 20:6) They, like Jesus, are invisibly raised to join him in the spirit realm. Thus “those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.” Then those anointed Christians still living on earth will, as they complete their earthly course, “be caught away in clouds [resurrected as invisible spirit sons of God] to meet the [invisible] Lord in the air.” Thus, “afterward,” as mentioned in 1?Thessalonians 4:17, means that such faithful ones who then die will also receive a resurrection in the spirit.—1?Corinthians 15:51-53.|`|N8wutNoLaa	because the rapture, the pretrib-rapture at least, is not biblical.|`|MEny7pBHaa	Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.

Isaiah 30:18<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it is simple... the day of the Lord is what will come once He takes the light and the salt from the earth. darkness and decay will reign for a time. Jesus said it will be such turmoil there has never been the like, nor will there EVER be anything like it again. woe to the earth indeed. God is waiting as long as He can, so one more soul can come to Him, one more child can be spared what is coming. eventually mercy will give way to wrath and God will be forced to act. it is coming soon, just be patient, it will be more than worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus is the light of the world, and when He comes again it will be a new Sonrise.... and one thing about the sun, you can't hurry it up, and you can't slow it down... God alone knows the day and hour, it is His final mystery to present, so allow Him to keep it while He can. when He comes again paul said the mystery of God will be revealed forever. He will show Himself to the world in full glory and power. it is like the story of joseph, his identity was his to hide from his brothers while he had them in his hands as ruler over egypt. but then he revealed himself and forgave their sin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Although the Lord has given you bread of privation and water of oppression, He, your Teacher will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will behold your Teacher.

It's the fundamentalist Christians who can't face the facts.  If you've ever been to the Creation Museum, in Petersburg, Kentucky, then you know that mainstream Christians are embarrassed by the fundamentalist ignorance on display at the museum.<br>  <br>  Also, Pope John Paul II has proclaimed evolution to be compatible with Catholic doctrine.<br>  <br>  So, your facts are skewed.

Nv3eQenUaa	Paul was referring to the fact that Abraham had conceived two children one to a slave/bondwoman (which foretold the slavery of the Hebrews in Egypt) and one to a free woman and his actual wife.   The second one was God's long delayed promise to Abraham (and consequently foretold the establishment of a free Israel).   Abraham in his actions and through God's promises to him actually foretold the history of his people through his two heirs-- a story of slavery and freedom.     When Paul says the"the Jerusalem above is free; she is our mother" he is referring to the establishment of the free state which developed through Sarah (free line of inheritance) and which will always be God's promise to the Jews.    He also means the new Jerusalem of heaven promised by Jesus as part of the new covenant.   Thus we become sons of God through both the lineage of Abraham and the sacrifice of Christ.    When we are born into and accept Christ as our savior we are fulfilling God's promise to Abraham and Christ's promise to us.    We overcome the slavery of sin and partake in the new freedom that Jesus offers.|`|TneDU9R3aa	The passage talks about son's of the slave women and son's of the free woman.<br>  <br>  But we are all slaves. We are either slaves to righteousness or slaves to materialism. Nobody upon earth is free to leave, so we are not free, we do not live in the perfect Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  We do have 'free will' to chose between 2 possible natures that both exist within us. Those who chose righteousness; worship the values of the Holy Spirit, our mother who lives in the perfect Jerusalem. Those who chose righteousness; chose to keep reading Gods word, so that we are always growing, never in the shade. Those who chose righteousness are the most trapped, most enslaved. For they are living in a world whose values are contrary to the Jerusalem above.<br>  <br>  Jerusalem means City of Peace. <br>  All humans are in a house divided by their bodies physical nature and the incarnate nature of the Soul. The word of God is like nutrients in fertile soil, that cause the seed to grow, until it has become a tree. The mind must become in harmony with the Spirit so that all inside the house are at peace <br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:11-22<br>  14For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, 16and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through righteous sacrifice, by which he put to death their hostility.|`|SmF9yU2Eaa	beacause jerusalem is where the original christians were from...the mother of true christians...their home|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Because in the Millenium Jerusalem is where Christ will sit for 1000 yrs.

Jerusalem is the motherland and the remnant or Christians, through Christ, will come, even until this date.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Gal 3:7 Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham"<br>  <br>  The children of Abraham were born in Jerusalem. So if you believe in Christ than you are also the children of Abraham through Christ.<br>  <br>  Think about it.<br>  <br>  God speaking of Jerusalem:<br>  <br>  "Eze 16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine."<br>  <br>  This is how God feels about Jerusalem. He took her to wife ("...and I spread my skirt over thee...")|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	These versus are illustrating how Israel was in slavery under the Law, trying to obey the law (Children of the law - i.e. Children of earthly Jerusalem)<br>  <br>  In contrast, under the new covenant of Jesus Christ, we are not slaves to the law, but are born from a new covenant of freedom (the new heavenly Jerusalem).|`|oFiStmkGaa	Salvation cannot be achieved literally by keeping the letter of the law, we cannot attain salvation through good works, trying to do it in our own strength through Hagar in other words.<br>  <br>  What we need is to be spirtually reborn if we wish to take part in the promise of salvation. We need to be forgiven and reborn through our Spiritual Mother, which is the Set-Apart (Holy) Spirit, hence why Paul referred to Sarah because Yahweh made a covenant with Abraham that said the promise will come from his [Abraham] own body. It is the promise of the Set-Apart Spirit in our lives, the promise of the New Jerusalem, the promise of receiving a spiritual body so that we can live in God's heavenly city for all eternity.<br>  <br>  It is the Set-Apart Spirit that gives us life, She is our Mother. The word spirit in Hebrew is "ruach" and it is a feminine noun. Consider the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:12): "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which Yahweh your God is giving you." In other words, honour your Heavenly Father and your Spiritual Mother, that your days may be extended into eternity upon the promise of the inheritance which is the salvation of your soul. Hence why blasphemy against Spirit is unforgivable, simply because a person rejects to be born again.<br>  <br>  PS: Notice how Paul explains the metaphors of the Law, the figurative meanings of the words within the Law. We should be applying that rule to every word within the Law, even to the strange passages concering the Temple as they have incredible spiritual meanings and are often prophetic detailing God's Path to and Plan of Salvation.<br>  <br>  PSS: We are not free from keeping the Law, but have received freedom from condemnation. The Law is not heavy to follow, since we cannot literally keep the majority of it anyway since there's no temple, but we need to inwardly keep it and we should try and understand the spiritual importance of the Law. For example, the Law says we should not wear clothing woven with two kinds of material (Leviticus 19:9), but do you think God is concerned about our clothes (see: 1 Corinthians 9:9)? No, but God was telling us we shouldn't wear garments of darkness and garments of light together. So when Paul says "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?" in 2 Corinthians 6:14 we can understand that he always based his understanding in context of what was written in the Law.|`|AA10449999	Good question!<br>  It helps to understand that in the Bible (Old and New Test.) God uses the name Jerusalem in three different ways:<br>  1. to describe the actual literal city which is in the nation of Israel<br>  2. to describe the external representation of the Kingdom of God, ie; the temple and the synagogues of Old Test. which were the custodians of God's word, and the the New Test. local congregations and churches which were the caretakers of the Gospel (God's word) during the church age.<br>  3. to describe the eternal Kingdom of God, the church, the bride of Christ, which is the one which will come down from heaven to be the new and eternal city which is made up of all God's true children that He chose from the foundation of the world (Ephes.1:4) to be with Him forever in the new heaven and earth.<br>  <br>  While on one hand God describes this "city" as His bride, in the feminine sense; likewise, a bride would eventualy become a mother of children. While God is the author and completor of our salvation, He does use the believers as His tool in spreading and sharing the Gospel (His word) which the Holy Spirit applies to the heart of those He chooses to save: "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God" (Rom.10:17). So in a sense, all of God's elect are adopted and born again through the body of believers which are one in Christ who ultimately is their mother as well as husband as well as father.<br>  No child of God is adopted into the kingdom of God without the word of God ( James 1:18, Ephes.5:26). Therefore we who are living and believe have the priveledge, the duty, the command to share the gospel with others. We are the mother, the true eternal church, not the external, corporate church which is below and on every street corner.<br>  Even though we are still in this world, in these corruptible bodies, we as His children have our souls already in the heavenlies with Him (Ephes.2:6) ascending and descending the ladder that Jacob saw; abiding in Him in the "heavenlies" yet serving Him in this world.<br>    <br>  "and this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then the end shall come" (Mt.24:14)<br>  <br>  May God richly bless you in Christ Jesus|`|2GO66bGKaa	The′se is heavenly part of God′s organization.

f9yORGumaa	I have had trust issues with my boyfriend ever since he cheated on me. (this was years ago.) Sometimes it's just something you can never let go and it sticks with you and makes you angry at the strangest times. Sometimes I'll see a movie I saw around the time he cheated on me and it will remind me and make me angry all over again.<br>  <br>  Trust is the easiest thing to lose and the hardest thing to gain after betraying it.<br>  <br>  I know it helps me when my boyfriend gives me all of his attention and showers me with affection. It helps when he tries to do things I like to do just to make me happy. When he shows me, in big or small ways, that I'm the one he really loves.<br>  <br>  People need to understand that they can't just leave the one they love for the one they like. there are two reasons for this.<br>  <br>  If you leave the one you love for the one you like, the one you like will leave you for the one THEY love.<br>  <br>  and...<br>  <br>  You may not have the one you loved in the first place, after you left him for someone else.<br>  <br>  So basically if you cheat, you are just screwing yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you can work it out.|`|oDdXpghDaa	Sorry guy, but I cheated on my bf of 6 years last year and we had to break it off because he could never trust me with anything ever again.

Cleanliness, hot water, competence of electrical appliances. Second to that heating, insulation, the standard of electrical wiring. The ability for all generations and ages of people to enjoy the facilities highlighted within ergonomics, so you want, windows, doors and light switches etc to be at a stable and easily operated position for all occupants.(except children really - safety is paramount) <br>  <br>  Having a feeling of relaxation and tranquillity is gonna be near the top of the list for most homes, neutral colours especially light blue,  access to light and soft carpets can help create this feel.|`|X4hz3a9haa	welcoming, and comfortable, some people have homes like Show Houses, and if 1 ornament is out of place they have to straighten it, or if you drop a crumb they are out with the hoover,|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	A good home is well balanced, the house doesn't have clothes and junk all over the living areas ie, family room,living room, bathroom,kitchen and dining room.  <br>  What you do in your own bedroom is  your own business but if the clothes and food is attracting insects then it needs to be cleaned thoroughly because it will effect the rest of the household.<br>  Kitchen's should be close to spotless, sink always empty, no dirty dishes, counters relatively clear and wiped, anyone that uses an appliance or pan needs to clean it.<br>  Everyone pulls their own weight, when the house is clean communication flourishes.. you ever notice the dirty the house the less the family talks to one another? they mostly talk to the television set or the computer.  It's odd.
ZZ4tkytYaa	For me it was a classmate in the 5th grade. I was curling parts of my hair with a pencil because I just found out that pencils could do that and liked the way the curls were so small. Then this kid was like,"Why are you curling your hair, you're not pretty." Well I hadn't even thought about being pretty and I was too young to think about who's more handsome.. well what he said meant to me"You are unfit, you will not be loved by anyone, you will live alone and will die alone." Well by the 8th grade girls were telling me that I was "so pretty" and I didn't believe them, I thought they were all making fun of me because I was ugly to everyone before(I had been told on more than one occasion). Well I figured that it was possible because I didn't care to fix my hair other than the basic pony tail and I was poor and didn't have nice clothes. Those same guys who made my life a living hell in school have tried to make moves on me. It's weird and I don't think I could like someone who only is nice to people because of the way that they look. I've struggled with my self- esteem for a long time, and it still appalls me to this day that people would call me "pretty" I don't see it for myself, but there are people who do.  It's just nice to know that people have different tastes and there's always someone who will accept you no matter who you are.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Your account has been suspended... yada yada yada.|`|zzzS27Cbaa	U HAVE TO TAKE THERE WORDS INTO CONSIDERATION IN WHICH U HAVE TO KNEW THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE BEAUTY OR HANSIM BUT THERE ARE SOME MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THAN THIS: SO TRY TO FIND THE THINGS THAT U R TALENTED IN F U DID NOT FIND JUST B VERY KIND AND HELPFUL TO PEOPLE, THIS IT SELF MAKES U VERY BEAUTY'<br>  <br>  ON THE OTHER HAND TRY TO FORGET WHAT DID THEY TOLD U ND TRY NOT TO TAKE IT AS A NEGATEVLY WAY<br>  <br>  FOR ME THE WORST THING SOMEBODY TOLD ME IS I WANT  TO BREAK UP WITH U AND IAM BADLY IN LOVE|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	.....after I got out of the military,was in during the Viet Nam era,had some one to call me a "baby killer"(derogatory term used for soldiers in NAM).I was a "Medic" and took care of people.So this was very hurtful.|`|3uaamLcGaa	Oh gosh, i'm sorry to hear of your experience.

I don't have a "top 10" list or anything so i must think for a minute...<br>  <br>  Gosh, to be honest, it's a big blur to me. I've had so much verbal abuse heaped on me, i can't even think of the specific things, my mind gets all foggy.<br>  <br>  This may or may not be the most hurtful thing, but probably having my head screwed with.

Branding in the middle of the forehead was also a good way to make a felon think twice before he broke the law.  It is too bad that we became so civilized. Being civilized does have it's down side, I guess. It seems that the law abiding citizen in a civilized society pays a pretty steep price for the benefits.
N8wutNoLaa	it would be a tough situation to be in, especially if your engaged!<br>  <br>  just keep praying about it. pray pray pray.<br>  save all that sexual tension for the big night ;)|`|2Hot9EJiaa	First of all moving in together for any reason is wrong.  The temptation gets greater when you are alone in your house. You both are Christians and know that you are living in sin, but continue to do it. I have a question for you- are your "finances" more important than your relationship with God and obeying Him?  Think of it that way, it may help.  In Colossians  it says to "PUT TO DEATH ANYTHING THAT HINDERS AND IS SEEN AS SIN IN THE EYES OF GOD".  He will give you the strength to move out until marriage and abstain , but you must put to death what is sin.  The only advice that I can give you is what David should have done when he saw Bathsheba-  FLEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Your relationship with God most come first. Just think you are getting married in 4 months- why ruin your relationship with God, over this. Nothing is worth that.  If you 2 did not realize what you were doing was sin, there would be an excuse- but you know it is- you are both making his free gift of grace , cheap- it is not cheap it cost Christ His life.  I really don't mean to be harsh, but I have to remind myself of this every time I blatantly want to continue in sin.<br>  <br>  EDIT-  you say that moving out is not an option- so are you saying that God would not provide for you, if you choose to do His will? Does not sound like God to me|`|jBYxEX8taa	Well you've already had sex numerous times a short time before the wedding...but yeah, it's never too late I guess. You just have to keep in the lustfullness. It is very hard, I mean I've struggled with just masturbation, nevermind sex. You should try thinking which is more important in your lives - God, where you can wait till you are married to have sex again, or - sex, where you can just keep doing it, married or not. You're obviously feeling guilty because God is telling your heart it's wrong.<br>  <br>  Edit: Response to Trippa - If God has planned for 2 people to be together, then He would make sure you are sexually compatible. You don't have to find out the guys penis size before marriage to come to a conclusion....you just have to believe in God and trust His decisions for us.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	thers not a single verse in the bible that says premarital sex is wrong.<br>  if your sex is the result of mutual love and not merely lust there is nothign wrong with it.|`|Wg3UySpfaa	I think as christians you have to be strong willed and Focus on what's right.

Why on earth abstain if you are going to get married anyway.  I have to say, having so many hang ups might not cease at marriage.  Everybody these days has sex with their fiancé(e).|`|UzZyxTtEaa	Try counselling with a well respected marriage councellor or dryhumping|`|5nfqY9T7aa	OMG Get with the times.  Sex before marriage isn't a big deal.  Maybe sleep in separate rooms if you're THAT concerned with it.|`|gf0sAfoTaa	Hmmmmm.<br>  <br>  Don't see each other at all until the wedding day.<br>  True love will endure or if it's just lust the act will win out.<br>  <br>  How to put a Gennie back into the bottle???????|`|d52bf83507b89849cbeeb5a3afe97afaaa	close your eyes|`|c7085b913f10829ed0924234a3584d43aa	I hate to sound heartless, but the answer is simple. Get married now - or move out. Either you are going to dedicate your live to this person, or you aren't.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the bigger issue is that you have been suckered into this Western concept of "long engagements" which is by no means beneficial in somehow "laying a foundation" to marriage. Like I said, you are going to marry this person, or you aren't. Act now, or pay later.<br>  <br>  Be very careful about the choice you make, 1 Corinthians 6:9 -<br>  "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders"|`|tRcO5uyiaa	Please take this answer in the context it is intended. It's not meant to hurt or offend. However, this question is just vacuous. You and your fiance have had sex before marriage, so the damage has ALREADY been done. I don't understand the point of you asking about "avoiding sex before marriage". You are asking for advice on how to 'avoid' each other intimately, yet living together in the same residence, from now until your wedding day. And you are not as close to God as you could be. I haven't even answered and I have a headache! The only thing I can say about this unorthodox situation is - don't eat any oysters...|`|HrQDQvUUaa	It's simply a case of willpower. <br>  <br>  My fiance and I had three couples tell us we wouldn't be able to refrain from having sex before were married. It was hard, but we proved them wrong, and later found out none of them had made it.<br>  <br>  Moving in together for financial reasons was your first mistake. Two of you, alone, in the same house. Would you allow your daughter to move in alone with her boyfriend "for financial reasons?"<br>  <br>  Remember what Paul said;<br>  <br>  I Corinthians 10:13<br>  <br>  13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.<br>  <br>  <br>  And remember what Jesus said;<br>  <br>  Matthew 18:6-7<br>  <br>  6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <br>  <br>  7 Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh! <br>  <br>  <br>  You are BOTH putting temptation in each others' way by living together, and are BOTH denying God's power by saying that "you have no other choice but to live together".<br>  <br>  You DO have a choice. Stop living in sin, or continue sinning as you have been doing. One of you has to move out to remove the temptation.<br>  <br>  <br>  God told Israel through Isaiah;<br>  <br>  Isaiah 1:16<br>  <br>  16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd follow that commandment.|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	I answered a question from lady who kept 'pure' before marriage. She was upset when she found out her husband had a very small penis.  Be glad that you know that you're sexually compatible. You can then know if you completely love that person. Sex is not an evil or bad thing, and I'm a Catholic boy. It's perfectly natural.<br>  <br>  Willpower and not putting yourselves into arousing situations will make it easier if you both really want to.|`|ULUpOqplaa	The only reason there are prohibitions against pre-marital sex is that the catholic church required priests to be present when a couple had sex and if they had sex before they were married the church was missing out on a few cheap thrills and money they would have made off it.  God doesn't care but the church does.|`|K8IJXzVjaa	In the name of God. The compassionate, the Merciful.<br>  <br>  Peace to you!<br>  <br>  In Islam, this problem would be easily solved because Allah (Alaha in Jesus' language Aramaic) says that we should not come near adultery. <br>  <br>  [17:32]   You shall not commit adultery; it is a gross sin, and an evil behavior. <br>  <br>  But in Islam, God also gives us solutions. Such include that a Muslim should lower his gaze,:<br>  <br>  Surah An-Nur: "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest." (An-Nur: 30-31) <br>  <br>  However in your case, a couple who wish to marry in the future should observe the following:<br>  <br>  [2:235]   You commit no sin by announcing your engagement to the women, or keeping it secret. GOD knows that you will think about them. Do not meet them secretly, unless you have something righteous to discuss. Do not consummate the marriage until their interim is fulfilled. You should know that GOD knows your innermost thoughts, and observe Him. You should know that GOD is Forgiver, Clement. <br>  <br>  In the light of the above verse, you should not meet your fiance unless you have something righteous to discuss, and if you sleep under the same roof, then at least sleep in different rooms. This will minimize the sin you commit.<br>  <br>  [4:16]   The couple who commits adultery shall be punished. If they repent and reform, you shall leave them alone. GOD is Redeemer, Most Merciful.<br>  [4:17]   Repentance is acceptable by GOD from those who fall in sin out of ignorance, then repent immediately thereafter.  GOD redeems them. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.<br>  [4:18]   Not acceptable is the repentance of those who commit sins until death comes to them, then say, "Now I repent." Nor is it acceptable from those who die as disbelievers. For these, we have prepared a painful retribution. <br>  [4:19]   O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit what the women leave behind, against their will. You shall not force them to give up anything you had given them, unless they commit a proven adultery. You shall treat them nicely. If you dislike them, you may dislike something wherein GOD has placed a lot of good.<br>  <br>  Peace to you...|`|i85Dui0maa	its like drugs just say no ...it worked for me<br>  <br>  we were together for 4 years and engadged 2 of them... we waited tell marriage ...although it was hard it was worth the wait <br>  and there is something called a born again virgin ...do a google on it and see what you think|`|oNb8RqTEaa	What harm can it do?

pnxzK1nhaa	This may be a problem because in hispanic countries women tend to cater to the man and men of latino descent also get away with having affairs too sometimes even though they have wives and their wives know about it.My bf of 5 years is Mexican and the first thing his mom told me is that she wants grandchildren!!I was like what???Luckily his sister who is also a college graduate is very independent and thinks more like me as far as NOT waiting on the man goes so his mom is understanding.But some ppl are truly old-fashioned.I don't believe this is the typical attitude, but your daughter needs to speak up to her husband and HE needs to fix this because this isn't fair for her.She should be invited to great events like weddings and if she isn't than her husband shouldn't go either.<br>  <br>  I know a girl who married a hispanic man and all she did was get married at 18 after dating since she was 14, move to MX and have babies.She doesn't even care for her education at all.She is like the typical Mexican wife but she isn't Mexican.That is sad to see, so I think it is great that your daughter is breaking those stereotypes.Latino men shouldn't expect babies and housekeeping if they plan on marrying american women.

ea338428f11ccb6b0f8f147ef07f64a3aa	((((Cosmos))))  How you? :-)<br>  <br>  I never could sign on to the idea of the rapture.  It's not Christ's teaching - Christ never spoke of details in which people would be "raptured up" - it's driven solely by the Revalation - a book late on the scene that isn't relevant to the era in which Christ lived and preached and taught.  The book reads like someone had a series of odd dreams and decided to write them down.  No more and no less.<br>  <br>  My concern about the rapture concept was always this. . . what of the animals and abandoned things left on?  It would be catastrophic and cause needless injury to a lot of other people, simply because they didn't believe in Jesus subjectively good enough????<br>  <br>  Not right.

jz9CnL2Eaa	Education in our society is considered a public, not private, responsibility because it does benefit society, as a whole, to have at least minimally educated individuals to the point where they can become contributing members of society.  They can read the stop signs.  They can get jobs where they can earn money, provide services to that community, spend the money they earn in the community and help keep local economies afloat.  Minimal education of the individual arguably benefits those around them.  Therefore society pays for it, as a whole.  Specifically, yes, that does mean taxes.    So when you say you don't benefit from other people's kids getting educated, you could not be more wrong.  Every day you benefit from it.|`|UzSaTblgaa	Having a good school system benefits all of society.  Having a good school in your neighborhood benefits you whether you have children or not.  Your house is valued by potential buyers by the quality of the school district it is located in.  There should be more ways to pay for schools that just using property taxes but there is none provided in the law.  Until that changes, real estate taxes support the largest part of a school district's budget.  Think of the value of your home as if it is for sale and you will hopefully realize why paying school taxes benefits you even if you do not have children.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I agree that the breeders should be responsible for their own spawn, but what does one do?

I deny there are any benefits that come to me from these things, just as you deny that public schooling provides you with benefits.

a9zgx9iPaa	Hi Hapahaole,<br>  Your view of the 10 Commandments is very shallow. By the way Moses didn't etch them, God did. It's the only part of the Bible that God actually wrote.<br>  Let's look at them in more detail - taken from Exodus 20:2-17.<br>  1. You shall have no other gods before Me. Other gods can constitute material things not just spiritual. Some people have money as their god, or their car, or house or other possession.<br>  2. You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments. If you have a Catholic catechism you won't find this commandment listed! Go into any Catholic church and what do you see - statues. In the eyes of many Catholics these images are reverenced and prayed to.<br>  3. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain. Some people understand that this means swearing and using God or Jesus' name as a profanity. It's much deeper than that. In Biblical terms name is character. There are many people who say that they are Christian but are not. They are taking His name (character) in vain.<br>  4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it. The longest of all the Commandments. It begins with "remember", somehow God must have known that this would be the forgotten Commandment, the one conveniently ignored by most churches today. The Seventh day Sabath commemorates creation and brings to mind the Creator. Yet we have churches that go along with theistic evolution!<br>  5. Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you. Parents are seldom honoured these days. There is no respect for the elderly and we see cities and towns where gangs of youths control the streets at night, have no respect for the law and crime soars.<br>  6. You shall not murder. A basic requirement in the laws of every nation on earth. Some people conveniently read this as "You shall not kill" and then accuse God of breaking His own Commandment! Jesus expanded on this Commandment in Matthew 5:21,22. “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder,and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hell fire." That puts a different slant on it doesn't it?<br>  7. You shall not commit adultery. Again Jesus expands on this in Matthew 5:27,28. “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Again a much broader application than seems at first.<br>  8. You shall not steal. Another law that forms the basis of the laws of every nation on earth. Have you ever had a possession stolen from you? If you have you'll know what it feels like and it's not pleasant.<br>  9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. We call bearing false witness perjury or trying to pervert the course of justice. So it's not a bad law.<br>  10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s. Now if you have a Catholic catechism you will find that you have TWO commandments that begin with "You shall not covet..." You see because they dropped the 2nd Commandment they had to make it up somewhere to keep it to TEN. Coveting is not physical. This is the only Commandment that deals with the mind. When we covet something it often leads to breaking one of the other Commandments.<br>  Jesus summed up the Ten Commandments like this, " Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 5:19.<br>  Blessings,<br>  H'chat.|`|vUiUoamVaa	YOU know what other things He meant -- should not have to explain that such and such was wrong.  It boils down to how much you view the commandmens and what they say ... He gave explanations later on.  <br>  <br>  Either do or quibble with Him later on.|`|Lfn2LOTzaa	The 10 commandments are just ten of the general rules handed down to Moses. However, all the other crimes are addressed in some form or another in the Bible. It is a big book made up of more than JUST the 10 commandments and the 1st testament. The bible in it's whole is a compilation of all the words handed down (by God) to the prophets (including Jesus). You are not supposed to ONLY listen or pay attention to just one prophets teachings. Like I said, it's a big book.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	The bible is seriously out of date, I'll tell you that right now...|`|9dkONba4aa	The 2 laws of love in the NT and the 10 commandments are the same thing.  The law that says to love God with your whole heart is the same as the first 3 to 4 commandments. The  law to love your neighbor as yourself is the same as the rest of the commandments. The 10 commandments explain how to love your neighbor and how to love God.  The 2 laws of love were already mentioned in the OT. Man is the one that summarized the 10 commandments. Rape is covered by the law that says not to commit adultery. "Adultery :" means more then just cheating on your wife or husband.  After the 10 commandments are listed in the Old Testament, then in the following chapters ,it lists in more detail what each commandment covers. Adultery would cover homosexuality, cross-dressing, child molestation, rape, incest, pornography(pornea), etc. Adultery comes from the word to adulterate, which means to change from its natural form. Putting poison in someones milk for example would be adulterating the milk and would be tabu. False weights would be under , thou shall not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness against they neighbor also would mean not to go to court and lie against someone falsely. It also covers not lying in general. The one about not lusting thy neighbors goods or land or servants would cover greed. The modern word for servants today is employees. Also this law covers land laws, like only planting for 6 years and giving the land a rest the 7th year. This way the soil does not become depleated of minerals etc.  The land can refresh itself and the crops will keep coming up.  In USA history, we find out about how in early America, that when farmers planted year after year, the soil would not grow good plants anymore. I think we had trouble with cotton and peanuts. Then there is the rulee about burying feces. We know that is important today because of germs.  Even our holiday practices come from the Old Testament. Holiday is the modern word for Holy day. On a holy day , one was supposed to not work. One was supposed to gather with every one else and have a parade with trumpets!!!  There was supposed to be food served.  We call those food booths today. There was supposed to be meat(flesh) and baked bread(bakery goods)(pita sandwichs) and well oiled dishes(salads)(casseroles).  The meat(flesh) was supposed to be sacrificed (grilled)(bar-b-ques). That sounds like 4th of July, Thanksgiving, Saint Patricks Day, Cinco de Mayo, Mardi Gras etc. The reason it is called a sacrifice when the meat is grilled is cause the animal's life was sacrificed.|`|AA10883660	The Mosiac Law which included the "Ten Commandments" was given to the ancient Nation of Israel. It was to serve as a covenant between them and Jehovah God.The Law served as a protection for the people and it also set them apart from the surrounding pagan nations.<br>  The Law included directives regarding hygiene,looking after livestock,servants - there were over 600 of them.<br>  <br>  We are not under the law today.Christ fulfilled that law covenant when he presented his life blood to Jehovah God after his ascenion to heaven.<br>  <br>  Jehovah God does know everything. However He choses not to. He gave His human creations the gift of free will.To chose for themselves.<br>  <br>  The Bible does however warn us that Satan has been thrown out of heaven to the vicinity of the earth.That is why we have so much pain and anguish here.<br>  <br>  There is much to explain.

God deals with the sickness of the soul, not the proclivities of the flesh. the 10 are the law. the law was given to declare how far we have fallen. the Son was given to lift us back up. the law is the diagnosis of our sin, the Son is the cure.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  everywhere you read in the OT about so and so shall be put to death for such and such, you can place the name of Jesus there. He paid all of our penalty because we have all broken away from God's standard, we have become a disgusting thing in our sin. God dealt with those in israel strictly because they were a nation unto God. and God means business when it comes to the salvaging of souls, He won't respect the flesh but only for the sake of the soul. we are all transgressors and heaven has charged us for damages, the greatest lawsuit in history is against sinful mankind. Jesus is the only way to settle out of court. refuse Him and you'll represent yourself before God with all of your shiny sins as exhibit a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i... and so on as the evidence against you. talk your way out of that why don't ya? no, God knew we could not, that is why He died. the Light of the world was slain by darkness... God the Almighty from everlasting died once and for all sin. He carried ours to the grave, but because He had no sin of His own, the grave could not hold Him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  as for bill maher, i am sure he is a man who means well... but one can be completely devoid of wellness and still have good intent. in the case of Christianity and religion, the guy is out of his element. ridicule is his game... faith is a solemn thing.

Ow6lKFXiaa	First off, no this murder was not possibly carried out by anyone else, and certainly not for the purpose of making Muslims look bad.  The husband did this and no one else.  You do yourself a disservice by putting forth such a ridiculous idea and, by extension, a disservice to other Muslims.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think this makes anyone look bad except the husband.  It is only the method of the murder that has any relevance to his religion.  Had he chosen any other method to carry this out, you would not be asking this question.  It is unfortunate that he used a culturally traditional method to commit the heinous act. The problem is that it is culturally traditional and that's what makes Muslims look bad.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Sure.

x0giFK1Naa	It's all fine, don't worry.  They're not demons, they're just things newbies assume are demons.  In reality, they're of no concern whatsoever.  Sometimes they're self-created personifications of your fear, other times they're what Robert Bruce calls 'astral wildlife', independent entities in their own right but only analogous to insects in terms of relevance, strength, intelligence etc.  You can run rings round them if you choose to, but it's more constructive to ignore them, they just don't matter.<br>  <br>  The very act of attempting to project raises your vibrations away from sleep paralysis related fearfulness and the lower etheric, so if you proceed regardless instead of hanging around you'll find that anyone who was around simply vanishes.|`|ouEdxS5taa	edit: "seeing demons crawl on them."<br>  <br>  very dangerous, basically being processed,  and might drive you insane.<br>  <br>  *blah*, i have seen people use astral projection to channel ghosts, one danger they mention was that once the ghost enters a body, they might not want to leave, thus being possessed|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	I did it once.

If you are later asked to perform the task, you then have the option to admit that you had yupped the person and ignore the task, or pretend that you had really listened & just go along with the yuppee. <br>  <br>  If you are the yuppee, and you recognize that you are being yupped, you can call the yupper's actions & state "you're yupping me" or "I'm being yupped", whereupon the yupper may admit the yupping action and feel mild embarrassment, but there will be no permanent damage. <br>  <br>  yupping, being yupped, yupper, yuppee are all derived from the root 'yup' <br>  eg;<br>  <br>  Woman: Oh I got some great shoes at the mall, do you like them dear? <br>  Man (watching tv): yup <br>  Woman: so we're going to go back later, are you coming with us? <br>  Man (watching tv): : yup <br>  *2 hours later* <br>  Woman: ok, let's go <br>  Man: where? <br>  Woman: to the mall? you said you'd come with me later? <br>  Man - option 1: oh, I was just yupping you, I'm staying here <br>  Man - option 2: yea that's right, let me grab my coat <br>  <br>  hope this helped! <br>  (yup it did)|`|5mHF9C8Iaa	yes|`|C9AbiTDdaa	yes<br>  yeah<br>  ya|`|988dbb7fd23d6f47880d9e468760317aaa	It means yes as "nope"means no.

They could have passed through the desert in 40 days (as one bible scholar put it) instead they were there 40 years and it had a lot to do with all their complaining.  If we don't complain it makes a difference.  There's a lot to learn in the whole story!

Yahuah worked, through Moshe to lead them out of their slavery in Egypt.  He DID part the waters of the sea and they were able to pass.

Wasn't it sad how many times these same chosen ones, instead of realizing how HE was caring for them, slipped into disobedience and tried to turn away from HIM.

m4nKkFDUaa	Yes, it's a form of Catherine, and there definitely was a St. Catherine. There were three actually:<br>  <br>  Jesus gave Saint Catherine Labouré a vision of the Blessed Mother revealing an image that was to be made into the Miraculous Medal. He commissioned her to spread its devotion. It included the prayer: "O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee." He promised that those who wear it as a sign of devotion will receive the graces needed for holy living. <br>  <br>  Saint Catherine of Siena took her faith out into the world to make a difference for the Kingdom of God. She served as a spiritual guide to many, she affected politics, and she convinced the pope to return the Church’s leadership to Rome. By word and deed, she taught that Christians should influence the world with their spiritual values.<br>  <br>  Saint Catherine of Sweden, with her mother Saint Bridget, organized pilgrimages to Jerusalem and other places to stimulate people’s spiritual growth. In between pilgrimages, they spent their time in prayer and meditation, ministering to the poor and instructing them in religion.
bgA9wLD0aa	according to the latest scholarship, celtic and norse societies generally offered criminals and prisoners of war as sacrifices.  i.e. people they were going to kill anyway.  they also didn't have as literal view of reincarnation as is commonly accepted today, so an auspicious birth may have made someone special, but you'd have to prove yourself to hold on to that status.  the celts did have stories about gods and heroes being reborn, but they later went on to live extraordinary lives, so just being born on a certain date isn't enough.<br>  <br>  also, a slostice wouldn't have been as auspicious as a cross-quarter birth.|`|ttGk4VOxaa	I was born on the 18th of June, I share my birthday with a Beatle, that's the closes to God I'll ever get.|`|yqKlmaD1aa	You can look at the question is two ways:<br>  <br>  1) Modern Druids- no.  Modern Druids do not practice sacrifice.<br>  <br>  2) Historic Druids- there is no way of knowing.  Druids did not leave written records, what we know of them comes primarily from the reports of Roman soldiers and the recording of folklore by Catholic monks.  As the former were involved in a temporal war with them and the latter in a spiritual war, neither is a reliable or authoritative source.|`|mqV9TOv0aa	Actually neither one, but you will be raised as a GUARDIAN of Nature!

Most people here mind their own business and go on about their life. No one the is innocent deserves to die weather they are from your country or mine (like the 9/11 victims) every loss of life in those cases are sad. We need to get along and try not to tear each other apart or down. I am sorry that your are so very angry at people that you have never even meant. I am sure that something in your life caused you to be this way but you can't blame Americans for everything that is wrong in this world and in your life.

Don't push them.  A couple of them above even admit this.  Right over their heads, (which are typically tucked tightly inside their butts)|`|UinOWcMUaa	The sad thing is -- I do /did have realtives who are not / weren't believers.. sadly I will not see them in Heaven... It's just a reality... but we are all given a choice :)|`|QC94lBXOaa	Well if I understand correctly, there's a couple possible scenarios: <br>  <br>  1. The Christian child goes to heaven and the non-believing parent goes to hell..which makes you wonder, how can the child enjoy the "eternal bliss" of heaven knowing their parent is consumed by a lake of fire for all the ages? Wouldn't that make heaven more like a hell itself?  Unless, once you go to heaven you are not allowed to know who is there with you (we all know how the biblical god likes to keep knowledge hidden) in which case you would spend eternity in heaven seemingly by "yourself"..sounds rather lonely...and never be "reunited" with your loved ones. So any christian with non-believing loved ones can never experience actual "heaven", and who would want to worship a god so cruel that he would have the power to keep a loved one from the torments of hell, but chooses not to? And for those who say "they made their choice" it makes logical sense that once a person was sent to hell and experienced the torment, they would immediately choose NOT to be there, right? So then, according to the rules of christianity god would HAVE to take them out of hell, and bring them to heaven..or that means that there is no such thing as free will and our choices have no impact on whether we end up in heaven or hell. <br>  <br>  2. Another possibility is that god would be merciful and not send the non-believer to hell, and both the christian and non-believer would both be received in heaven...which makes a poor argument for an atheist like me to begin believing, if god actually exists,  then I'll be shown mercy ANYWAY and end up in heaven with the believers in my family whom I love.<br>  <br>  3. And of course the final possibility is that it's all rubbish to begin with.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	No, you would not forget them. Their purpose was to mate, have you as a Son/Daughter.

They cooperated with God to make you. Also they raised you, and you are a person who has searched, knows & loves the Truth.<br>  2. God made them to please Him, not you.  It is between Him & them what goes on in thier heart even until the moment they die.<br>  3. Reconize the good they do for you, all parents are human and flawed.  They may hurt us and God... but this does not deny the good they have done.  I have to believe they had my good in mind and they love me as best the knew how.

tL5YbnWjaa	There is no need to concern yourself with who is or isn't gay unless you are interested in a relationship with one. You should treat people the same whether they be gay, straight, or bi.<br>  If you are interested in a certain guy, making eye contact can reveal a lot. When you talk one on one, make eye contact and see if he will hold eye contact. If he holds eye contact, smile and see if he smiles back. <br>  Another way to let someone know you interested is by touching his arm or shoulder when greeting or saying goodbye.|`|v9EXG82Kaa	Ask him or her.

If you are showing homosexual tendencies then if one is interested in you he will find you. You must remember that like us hetrosexuals not every man fancies every woman and vice versa.

YB3ULPPeaa	Maybe they sense that you are not serious about wanting to learn more. Are you putting enough attention into it? I don't know how old you are, but maybe you can talk with them about taking a trip to Nigeria to see family or be an exchange student so you can learn more about the day to day culture and in return become more fluent :)|`|AA10100036	The best way to learn is by immersion - so if you can, try to visit for a while.  If that's not possible and your parents still won't help you consistently, then I would try two things.  First, see if you can't get a hold of some movies in the language that you want to learn.  Listening to the language with a real-time translation will help you get a feel for sentence structure, accents, and will help build your vocabulary.  Try Netflix or your library to find movies.<br>  <br>  My other suggestion is to go online and find a tutor that way.  Since you're fluent in English and already have a start on the language you want to learn, you might be able to find someone who is willing to help.  You can tutor them in English, and they can help you with your language.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Since she responds well to those, they may work for you at home as well.  Establish your rules, convey these rules to her and explain that she must abide by them or get out.  No ifs, ands or buts about it -- just like on the job, abide by the rules or you get fired.<br>  <br>  It was very generous of you to try and help a person in need, but your houseguest is too immature to appreciate your generous and kind spirit.

Free speech is frequently used as an excuse to bash Christianity, so I am more than willing to allow it so others can voice their opinions as well.  <br>  I received the April Fools day e mail, I didn't believe it but did think it was cute.

I think this country has made some really stupid decisions, but I'm not against it or in support of its downfall. I'll read these and then delete them. No biggie. I love my country; I just don't love it blindly. But then, the email, without missing a beat, moved right into linking respect of country and those who sacrificed their lives to believing and worshiping God. It basically went on an unsolicited rant asking why should 'good' Americans 'allow' God to be taken out of the pledge and courthouses and off the dollar bill. Some more dribble about us being founded as a Christian nation, and therefore we should always always remain so, lest we forget tradition automatically equals correct. <br>  <br>  That's the part that pissed me off.

The doctrine itself has numerous logical holes and Jesus' fan club doesn't exactly make people want to join.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Personally I find that the problems are with Christians.  The religion teaches God's words and it's up to us to follow them.  For instance, the other day I wrote a comment on a forum.  I realized afterword that I might offended somebody but I had to make the supper so I didn't write another comment.  It was all for fun anyway, I didn't mean any harm.  Later I checked the story to find out that this lady had replied to my comment and had done her best to try to insult me(example of one sentence, you can go throw yourself in a lake for all I care) and it was just a comment I had written about facebook, nothing personal.  I finally found an e-mail address where I could reach her to apologize and sent her an apology that came from my heart.  By the way, in her description she says that she believes in God and is a good person.  I had asked her to please reply but I didn't get anything.  Yesterday I left another apology and there's still no e-mails but I know she checked because they tell the time she was last on that site.  Hopefully she will accept my apology but if I don't get a reply, I don't find that she's a real Christian.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Certainly not in the religion.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Since the core teaching of Christianity is "Love one another," there is no way there could be any flaw in that.  It is the perfect way to live your life.<br>  <br>  So the flaws are in Christians who either ignore that central teaching in favor of judging and condemning, or who twist the concept of love into something that looks more like hate.|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's the Christians of course. One who doesn't know God has a better chance of going into Heaven than  a hypocrite.|`|i48kxrbaaa	Christians are the religion.<br>  So it's both, perhaps.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	it's Christians because some people who claim to be Christians don't even read the bible or even know how to interpret it.|`|3uaamLcGaa	I think it's the fact that us Christians are fallable human beings just like non-Christians.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like communism. Sounds great in theory, but for it to work in perfect harmony, it depends on people being fundamentally good, whereas we are fundamentally sinful.<br>  <br>  So just like anywhere in the world, church culture can become a bit eggy. Factions in leadership, corruption, the A list power couples and beautiful people...the brokeness in us can replicate what's all through the world.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, we have a loving and gracious God that helps us overcome those things and helps us learn to love others and ourselves and Him. <br>  <br>  Christianity is about the journey, not the destination. We don't just end up with God at the end, He is actually with us right the way through.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	The first flaw is in the thinking of those that christianity is a religion.  When you go before the King of Kings for judgement which is a blinking after your death, He will look in the Lamb's Book of Life to see if your name is written therein.  He will not have to skip over the names of nations, churches, religions, any other institutions in order to get to the names of individuals.  Only individuals can be born again in the spirit and be saved.  Read in John chapter 3, what Jesus told Nicodemus, that old wise pharisee, what it takes to be saved.<br>  <br>  There are far fewer christians in this world than you might thing and than what pollsters add up.  Many people consider themselves christian because of some religious affilitation which flies in the face of scripture.<br>  <br>  Religions are man made and need your bucks for support.  <br>  <br>  Christians aren't flawed, but christian wannabe's carry many sins in the names of their religions such as the crusades, inquisitions and all the rest.  <br>  <br>  "There is but one mediator between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus".  1st Timothy 2:5.|`|FYQe54Akaa	Flaws are in everyone and I like not being perfect cause I know learning from your mistakes is really good.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	I think the biggest problem with Christianity is Paul.|`|pvd3V8ppaa	Christians.

I do not believe their are any flaws in being Christ-like or in Christianity, which describes the entirety of all those who are being Christ-like.<br>  <br>  The problems, or flaws come into play from two fronts:<br>  <br>  1.  Christians who are not very Christ-like.  Whether they realize it or not, many Christians spend more time studying what their peers say a Christian should be like than study who Christ was and is.<br>  <br>  2.  The second "flaw," if you will, comes from those who are not Christians and are observing "Christian behavior."  Many observers simply do not know what Christ stood for.  They simply assume that if a Christian does something that they disagree with, then certainly, Christ, Himself would also disagree.  Obviously, that is not always true.<br>  <br>  There are of course many who do know, or at least have a reasonable idea of what Christ stood for and simply disagree with His ideals. <br>  <br>  That was the case in Jesus' day, and it certainly is now, as well.|`|C4miEeuYaa	I think it's in the Christians. I've been to church many times, but did not like what I saw in the people. They are VERY judgemental, and VERY hypocritical. *Not all~ but most*. And that is why I don't go to church anymore. I don't want to be around people who are going to judge my background or lifestyle without even knowing me. And try to push something on me so persistently without letting me take my time..And half the time, these people who judge are not Saints themselves. Thats just a couple of the flaws I see in some Christians...|`|AA10014750	I presently wopulod not call them flaws as much as I would call 'deviations' to God's word, presently 'test(s)'; which too many 'Christians' have not separated fromGod's word, thus allowing division and 'works of darkness' (Eph. 5:11 KJV).|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	CL,<br>  The only flaws that are present (in my opinion) are in people.

Of course all of us a humans and make mistakes, but we really should just keep trying to do the best we can and simply live by the bible.|`|tW86bOMNaa	A little of both, to be honest...|`|neuprBeGaa	In the religion itself.  The veneration of "faith" as a source for moral and ethical decisions is inherently flawed, as it simply hands over your personal ethical decisions to whoever can convince you they spoke to god.|`|AA11935914	The problem is Altruism which was glommed onto Christianity.

ALL religious have their share of fundamentalists who are completely sure their "truth" is the ONLY way for ALL.   Take some posts here by the atheists as an example  They are pretty "religious" about their lack thereof!<br>  <br>  The FLAW if there is one is in a lack of compassion for others of differing opinions and beliefs.  This can be present in folks of ANY religious affiliation.  Perhaps the second flaw is generalized statements such as this.  "to err is human"... therefore, we are all "flawed"?|`|EwzM7EEaaa	Hey Sage, I agree with you that alot of Christians are as you described, they don't practice what they preach essentially.<br>  However I just wanted to point out that not ALL Christians are like that<br>  Please avoid taking a whole people group as a whole and stereotyping them.<br>  So yeah, the flaws are in the people, not the religion<br>  Thanks!<br>  God Bless|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Just Christians !!!!!!!!!!!|`|KDNWFuZWaa	has to be both, the bible has contradictions and the people threw other humans to lions, and thats just for starters. lol|`|OywIJxobaa	in its Christians|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Both.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	The flaw is in christianity itself,it says NOWHERE  in my bible that Jesus or the apostles were christians(jesus himself was a jew)nor does it say that they were part of any denomination ,church,or organized religon.Scripture has been twisted by the father of the lie satan,he used the bible to his own evil benefit,that is why the very last words that GOD says in Revelation is that "And if anyone adds to or takes away "any part of what God has wrote,GOD shall take away his share in the tree of life,and in the holy city.{rev 22:19} God knew that satan through humans would try to twist his word that is why HE wrote that.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	The flaws in Christianity are the same as the flaws in any club, organization, family, group, corporation, state, province, parish, or country.  It's people!  PEOPLE are the problem.  <br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that with the fall of Adam that ALL are BORN fallen.  I used to have trouble with that idea of "original sin."  Especially when I had my precious little children.  But ... when those kids were only with my wife and me the first three and four years of their lives--mind you, not one second in daycare or with a babysitter!--and they could lie to me, scheme to get their way, use duplicity and such, I said: "Whoa!  There it is!"  I even put this to a friend of mine who argued against original sin.  I asked a plain question: If my kids were only with my wife and me and WE didn't teach them to lie then how did they learn to lie?  He was stumped in the face of overwhelming evidence that we're all born fallen!<br>  <br>  Most people, even atheists, see that all corruption, all evil, all misogyny, all murder, all rage, all violence comes from people.  So, here you are ... touting a religion that promises to save people from their sins.  Who will be drawn to that promise?  SINNERS!  Christians are wretches, just like the song says.  We're saved by the blood of Jesus.  But ... even within our faith we STILL SIN!  Even within our faith, we think imperfectly and we behave imperfectly.  <br>  <br>  If you want to cast dispersions, that's fine.  We're most certainly guilty of most any charge you want to make.  My only question to you is this: Are there no problems with the other (non-Christian) religions?  Are there no problems with Godless groups; e.g., the NAACP, NAMBLA, NOW, etc.?  <br>  <br>  If you see that only Chrisitians have problems then I think we've identifiied one of the problems with people.  We're biased in two ways.  We see our own behaviors as being better than they really are and we see the behaviors of those we dislike as being worse.  That's why we all need Christ.  Come to our extremely troubled faith.  You can help us work things out.  :-)<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	All institutions are flawed.  <br>  <br>  Christians (who know perfectly well the depth of their delusion) need to persecute others and keep alive the lie of their own persecution (never happened) in order to maintain their shaky beliefs.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	The only "flaw" of Christianity is that it's completely unsupported by any sort of evidence.<br>  <br>  The flaws of CHRISTIANS, however, are too numerous to count...|`|yzRHAWNhaa	It's people again.

If we choose not to love, that choice by definition separates us from God and each other.  That separation is the core definition of hell.<br>  <br>  C) God accepts all His children.  It's His children who may or may not choose Him (by choosing love).<br>  <br>  D) You have obviously been listening to too many evangelicals and radical conservative fundamentalists.  Bad idea.<br>  <br>  E)  I see lots of non-Christians making fun of Christians too, so it's not a unilateral problem.<br>  <br>  F) Any Chrisitan who is arrogant enough to judge the soul of his gay brother in Christ is ignoring Jesus's command to us to refrain from judging.  Mat 7:1|`|q6H2ru3waa	God loves all of us,  regardless to how you choose to live. He does not hate the person who lives in sin, He hates the "sin" .  2 Peter 2:4-5;  For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement; 5) and spared not the old world, but saved Noah and the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.

And ,while we do love gays, it doesn't mean we have to love everything they say and do, no more than we accept other Christians when they sin. In fact, we're supposed to admonish each other when we stray-much as we do gays, in Christian love. <br>  Love doesn't mean being blind.|`|G9dZN8omaa	1)  The God portrayed in the Bible is not a loving God.  He is selfish, narcissistic, and cruel.  He does NOT accept all of his children.<br>  <br>  2)  The Bible is full of so many contradictions, the Christians pick and choose which ones they want to follow.  So in a way, whether they choose the "tolerance" aspect, or the "hate" aspect, they are both following the Bible and not following the Bible.<br>  <br>  3)  See both 1 and 2 above.<br>  <br>  EDIT: As a response to Babygirl; Does that mean we are supposed to condemn our children because they don't agree with us?

Yet the OP will thumbs down all who disagree with them.<br>  <br>  Alls i can say is get used to it, it's the cesspool known as R&S at YA.<br>  <br>  But if you don't like it and us "religious folk" p*ss you off too much, you are free to leave at any time.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	Talk about crap and bias.

Trouble and fear accelerate the learning process.  This also means that we can only advance by succeeding at the demise of other people so we don't like all things good all the time, even though we constantly find personal justification for the bad things that we have to do.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	"Good people" do bad things just like "bad people" are capable of doing good things. You aren't perfect are you? Neither are they. Whether you want to have someone convince you to do bad things is up to you, whether you will listen to them is up to you. It's all about integrity. It doesn't matter if people think you are bad or good.

He just stands there and cries about it (because he's a selfish, greedy idiot), not realizing that if he let go of a few walnuts, he could easy draw his hand out of the jar.  The moral of the story is that it's better to settle for less than what you had originally wanted than to throw a tantrum over not getting exactly what you want.<br>  <br>  Why he wouldn't just take his hand out and turn the jar over to dump out ALL the walnuts, I don't know...

I even asked a question about it on here. What everyone seems to tell me is that I simply wonder what it would be like to be with a girl. I like guys alot and I cant actually picture myself in a relationship with a girl but sometimes i get turned on by watching girl on girl action and I want to try it. I dont think this makes me bisexual and definatley not lesbian, I am just curious about what it would be like. The advice I am goin to give you is the advice that Im goin to try out myself since we seem to be in the same predicament. Just experiment. I dont have a boyfriend so it mite be easier for me, but you mite want to talk to your bf about all of this. He mite not care, cuz after all, he is a guy =P <br>  <br>  Hope I helped. I wish you lots of luck|`|XjLvbfTZaa	Watching girl on girl things means nothing.

yDmLWsd9aa	What matters is what you think of yourself. If you get with a white woman and you have kids, and one of your kids have dark skin.  What are you going to say? R u going love that child less because he's dark?  I think your wife or whoever needs to know. You can do and think what you want. Bottom line. It's really how society view you. Does society say your as hite?  I don't care.  To each it own but will whites accept you as one of their own. Can you attend a KKK meeting or rally? How will you feel with other whites use racial slurs, racial jokes or the n-word? I think Malcolm X  finally found himself and want to help his people.  Most black people will are very accepting of biracial people or children. I think you will have a problem if whites will accept you as white.  He finally thought of himself as a black man and married a black female. I guess if you are light skin or white enough.  You can pass but you can't ever reveal your black side. In America if you have on drop of African blood, you're considered black. Being black in America seem like it's a crime. I have a nephew who is biracial and passing for Hispanic.  We lost all communication with him. He doesn't want anyone to know that he's mixed. It's really sad. We should be accepted as human being but race matter in white America. Why do a lot of biracial people hate their black side?  I never heard of one hating their white side? It is because white are the majority and are perceive and better, prettier and smarter.  Why aren't you happy with being mixed or biracial?  Why is it either black or white? You have to learn how to be comfortable and happy in your own skin. Hold you head high and be proud of your mixed heritage. :\|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Who is criticizing you? More importantly, how does it make your dad feel when you identify yourself as white? <br>  <br>  Most of the world really doesn't care what you call yourself but unless you look completely white the rest of the world will see you as mixed or black. You can't change the whole worlds thinking, only the way you respond to it.|`|fia9gMHpaa	Who is doing that to you?|`|HqrU9RJOaa	Race is socially constructed. As an American you identify as a colored person becuase of "The One Drop Rule." It's like if you aren't purely white then you are mixed or colored and don't identify as White. Not saying that I'm judging you in anyway. Just saying that that's how those people you are talking about look at it.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	you can identify as a hamster if you want bruh.<br>  its your bidness|`|JxUFDutxaa	Do what you want.<br>  We'll survive without you..|`|0fRsWy05aa	Hey. If I was your friend, it wouldn't matter to me. I don't pick my freinds base on color. IMO I think a lot of biracial people are the most beautiful and handsome. Look at Derek Jetter and Alicia Keyes. You can do and be what you want but like someone else said. We live in a visual society. We go by what we see. If you even look like you have African blood, most people will assume you're black. Sorry, that just the way it is. I didn't make the rules. Look at famous celebrities who are biracial and some can even pass as white like Mariah Carey. So you look white, big deal. You don't get an award for being white. Are you going to marry white too? Live your happy white life. Why do you care what people think if this is how you feel. I want to know. Why you are so against being black or biracial? Why do you hate your black half or 1/4 or whatever side. Why do almost every biracial people have a problems with their black half? They hate being black but love being white. I have never understood that. Why do you feel ashamed or hate your black side or who you really are? I have girlfriends who are birracial and men of all races love them. They get hit on all the time. @~|`|XQhrHiUcaa	As for me, I don't care for color definitions but if you want to be technical, you're a quadroon.  Back in the bad old days (I'm 60 and remember the pre-civil-rights days of the south) there was a "paper bag rule".  If your skin was lighter than a paper bag then you could sit in the "white" section, otherwise you had to sit in the "colored" section. <br>  <br>  Now for the real question, are you a good person?  Do you treat all with respect?  Are you honest?  Are you kind?  Are you accepting of other groups?|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	The only people who can answer that are the as$holes who criticize you. I on the other hand can only guess, they're as$holes? Bob Marley was 1/2 white and his son Damien is 3/4 white coz his mom is white but they see themselves as black so its your call. Just remember there will be people on either side who criticize you so do what YOU want.|`|mRLYY14Yaa	Hmmm, what is wrong with being mixed race, which you are? Why do we have to be one or the other only? For instance, if you hide it from your potential mate, that would be unfair. There's still a chance your baby would look black even if your mate was white, and she/he may feel very deceived.|`|uC2Whritaa	Logic, mix a drop of black into white, it will never ever be white again. Hence, one drop rule.<br>  You're not white, you carry the black genes, and it may show up in future generations which has been known to happen. You are the perfect example of the race destroyer.<br>  <br>  Ashamed to show your black side huh?|`|npA75Obvaa	Well technically if you look back hundreds and thousands of years, no one is just one pure race. People are a vast mix of everything over the generations. So be who you want, and if someone criticizes you tell them to bite you.|`|wf3S2avqaa	Why? Thats a good question i personally don't know you to give a correct answer. Maybe people criticize just to be hate full? Maybe because you are giving people ammunition to criticize you. There couldbe many reasons.|`|G3ahqvmqaa	Does it matter wether u're black or white?

z26LSZt8aa	I am Irish and yes, parts of the country are beautiful in a misty, rainy winter-sun kind of way. But, the economy has just collapsed in a welter of debt and credit, the people in Dublin have, because of their previous wealth, become rude and arrogant. The nicest Irish people are to be found outside the capital. We DO drink way too much; the building industry and corrupt planners have turned a lot of the areas around our towns into urban sprawl, people throw litter about. We are chancers (this means that we boast and pretend to do things that we, in fact, cannot. Political nepotism is rife. Irish men cannot talk to women unless they are half drunk and have no idea how to be romantic or passionate. Irish women end up tolerating their men like overgrown baby boys, which leads to a lot of warm contempt but is not sexy at all. We bilk people for miserable tour attractions that aren't worth seeing and everything is too expensive. Like the English, we distrust art and intellectualism and tend to run down our greatest achievers,.

It's not a copy or imitation like Koran. It was not written by just one man. But the Holy Bible contains the revelations and oracles of many holy Prophets who lived from the beginning of the world. These scriptures are very closely connected with each other. It works like a follow up. It's an account of God's work from the beginning and also His plans for the future. The New Testament is a continuation of the Torah which is the Old Testament. All the prophets wrote about the coming of Jesus as the Messiah, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Elijah, Solomon, Isaiah, Daniel, and the Apostles of Lord Jesus Christ are the authors of the Bible. The Bible is not a one man's account like Quran. The Bible did not pop up overnight either. The Koran is only 1400 hundred years old. God was there even before that. God in the Bible is not just 1400 years old. He is from everlasting to everlasting. 'He is Eternal God. If anyone wants to know about this God, he or she needs to read and understand the Holy Bible. They need to examine what the Holy Prophets and Scriptures have been telling from the beginning of the world about this great and awesome God. Koran cannot establish anything without the help of the ancient Scriptures which were already there before Mohammad came and formed a religion.|`|RZfDrdIRaa	Where were you about 1/2 hour ago?!?! when me, the sinner was looking for god to deliver me from my drinking habit.....in which i received no reponse!!!

Reading the 4 gospels it becomes obvious that they observed things that happened and then wrote about these events slightly differently which is exactly what would happen if several people NOW witnessed an event and were then to write down what happened. There would be many similarities but some differences.<br>  <br>  The parts of the New Testament written after Jesus' death were written by people who had heard details which were passed down from those who HAD lived when Jesus was alive.<br>  <br>  This is no different from you or me passing down something that we have been told and then the ones that we have told passing it on.  Yes, discrepencies can occur when word of mouth is used but here we are referring to God getting His Word to His people and I am certain that He would ensure that the Word would have been passed on correctly.<br>  <br>  Also you comment that there is no book in the bible named Jesus. That is because Jesus did not come to write a book. He came to be a sacrifice for our sins. Something which is foretold in the Old Testament - a book which I believe all muslims also follow.  That particular prophecy was fulfilled down to the finest detail.<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that He GAVE His only Son that WHOSOEVER believeth in Him shall not perish but shall have everlasting life.

It is not just Islam or Judaism, there is also the Chinese I Ching, Indus Valley Civilisation, Shamanism and The various Celtic beliefs as well as Egyptian Gods.<br>  However if you take it from Muhammad, then Christianity, the Ise Shrine from Japan and Buddhism were all established before Muhammad and the Hijra in 622ce.<br>  Most religions feed on each others myths and stories that is why there is so many commonalities between them. <br>  The reason there are contradictions, and errors is down to the translators, that is why the Qur'an has never been translated and will never be, in case the same thing happens.<br>  If there is not so much dispute in Islam then why do you have so many saying they must fight every other religion, regardless or not of them doing anything to you, then the others who talk of peace among all.<br>  It seems that although the book is said the meanings come to settle differently amongst those who read them.<br>  So it is better to be good to all, love and respect all beliefs, and all people and to forgive than to follow any religion, that at any point of diversity shows callousness, hate, fear and disrespect.<br>  So to you Shalom.|`|jrdtQi04aa	I am a Christian.

We pray for understanding before reading, and you will get the ability to discern what it means.  I will let those who do not believe, not believe.

NpIWGtPkaa	Unfortunately most people who answered here are wrong. Foreigners can′t understand this matter. But as an Iranian AND persian I can give you a few reasons for that :<br>  <br>  1.Inside Iran there's a distinction between Iranian and Persian. Persian is the english term which would be translated to Parsi or Farsi inside Iran. All persians are Iranians, but not all Iranians are persians. So when i say I'm persian it signifies I'm from Iran and I'm a Fars. Not arab/turk/kurd etc (who also could be Iranians but not Fars)<br>  <br>  2. Since the majority of Iranians are Persians and the language spoken is also persian and the persian history and culture influences pretty much all of Iran thus sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably, specially in western world. <br>  <br>  3.After the Islamic revolution , the new regime tried to promote islamic culture and outcast all signs of pure Iranian traditions and values. The new regime puts more emphasis on Islamic and arabic culture rather than persian culture. So some people prefer to use the term "persian" more often as to show their support for our own culture which is in many ways distinct from arabic/islamic culture.<br>  <br>  4.Some Iranians outside Iran may also prefer to use Persian instead of Iranian so as to save the trouble of explaining many things to many ill-informed foreigners. In the mind of many naive people  Iran equals terror, Ahmadinejad, anti-semitism, axis of evil, etc   but Persia strikes up images like 1001 nights, prince of Persia, ancient history ,  persian carpet, persian cat, etc|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Their family probably left Iran when it was part of the Persian Empire.|`|7a15c276d2782ca7df8dc93ccf72655caa	Because they are|`|bf78cb2f1cf4fcc62a4faeff083a9a52aa	Well both are true.

6WxsrIusaa	The best thing to do is demonstrate--to EVERYONE--that you are above it all by ignoring this behavior.  The next time someone comes to you with one of those stories, you should say, "I'm not really interested in that.  Please don't bother me with so-and-so's nonsense anymore."  <br>  <br>  When someone goes around flapping their gums about someone else, it's usually because he/she is grubbing for attention.  If you react, you're reinforcing the behavior by giving him attention.  If you uninvolve yourself from the situation, you won't be giving him a reason to continue.  He may still run around yapping to others, who are still giving him attention, but you don't have to be a part of it.<br>  <br>  It is the hardest thing to do to let something like this go on without trying to do something about it.

That isn't being aloof, but, compared to the welcome you'll get some places, we tend to keep our distance at first. <br>  <br>  In our congregation, at least, we have a rocket scientist, (for real; a man with a Ph.D. in physics who worked for a national laboratory.)

Feel free to write if you have questions.<br>  <br>  If you leave this question up long enough (sometimes 20 minutes is enough), someone will say we are a cult, and someone else will say we are "The church that doesn't believe in anything." I'll address both of those misconceptions below.<br>  <br>  Most Christians believe God has three parts, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They believe Jesus was born of a virgin, that Mary was born without Sin and everyone else was born covered with Original Sin the way pelicans get covered with goo when an oil tanker springs a leak. (I'm simplifying considerably here, and I mean no disrespect.) <br>  <br>  UUs don't all believe the same thing about the nature of God. All of us have thought long and hard about it, and we each have our own beliefs about it. We do have common beliefs, but they have to do with actions, not the nature of God. We all believe in:<br>  <br>  1) "The worth and dignity of every person". That means people of all shapes, sizes, colors, ages, and incomes; straight, gay or lesbian. The gay or lesbian part usually upsets conservative people.<br>  <br>  2) "A free and responsible search for truth and meaning". In practice that means we question some parts of the Bible and that almost all of us believe in evolution.<br>  <br>  3) "The democratic process". In practice that means each congregation hires their own minister, instead of having a bishop send us a new one. We have more librarians and ACLU members per capita than most other churches.<br>  <br>  We have four other principles. Those three are the ones you hear about most often, and the three that set us apart from some other denominations.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to read more, I maintain the web site for my congregation. <br>  <br>  Our Beliefs:<br>  <a href="http://www.stanuu.org/beliefs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanuu.org/beliefs.html</a><br>  <br>  FAQ:<br>  <a href="http://www.stanuu.org/newfaq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanuu.org/newfaq.html</a><br>  <br>  What goes on in a typical service:<br>  <a href="http://www.stanuu.org/oofs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanuu.org/oofs.html</a><br>  <br>  Our national organization has a much more comprehensive web site:<br>  <a href="http://www.uua.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.uua.org</a><br>  <br>  Our congregation's site has better jokes.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to read LOTS more, our site has 40+ sermons, a dozen from our minister, two dozen from guests who are lay people.

Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams were Unitarians. Clara Barton was a Universalist.

Gj0zOqTyaa	Michelle M - you lost all credibility when you said the only British people you had met were on the internet.  I have met many Americans who live in England (one citing it as the best place in the world, even though she had been everywhere due to her father working for an oil company) and they are lovely.  The jerks on the internet are different.  In fact, I find the Americans on the internet much worse than the Brits (you being a prime example).  I would never, ever want to visit America much as you wouldn't want to come to Britain.  But at least I have valid reasons (which I won't go into) whereas yours are '13 year olds on the internet are jerks, so everyone in the nation must be horrid'.<br>  <br>  Dr Awkward - please tell me you're joking; everything you said was a stupid incorrect stereotype and you just sound like an arrogant idiot.|`|b81F1xtTaa	I am British myself born and bred but parents are pakistani. There are many stereotypes like having a 'stiff upper lip' i.e. they keep to themselves. I personally think it is a true stereotype, just go on the buses and underground, there is a time limit on how long you can look at some without offending them, its a problem if you are a daydreamer and when there is overcrowding. I developed a bad back using the underground tube. However, since I live there I do the same, if anyone looks at me longer then usually, I end up thinking they are psycho or weirdo. Another stereotypes are that from there accents they sound clever. Not many are, ony 14% of the population has done their A-levels. The one that are clever, I usually the best you can get.<br>  <br>  However, I personally think the people are the best bit of the UK rather then their history, definitely the funniest, I think I developed the sense of cynical comedy myself. They are fairer or more neutral then the rest of world but they have their limits. I think I would not be able to live anywhere else, I miss the atmosphere, the humour and the grumpness and tea-time.|`|3c3d24af1e6b481dc90443b14d2975d1aa	I'm british and i think we;<br>  - can't queue<br>  - complain a lot<br>  - have seriously bad weather<br>  - appear to be 'not so nice' to foreigners when we really mean to be nice.<br>  - are embarrassingly bad at foreign languages compared to others learning English.<br>  <br>  I love the UK, but the north (where i come from) is so much more lively than the south!

We put milk in hot tea anyway, so yeah. People think we're snobby, that we all talk like the Queen and that our food is bland. On the plus side, we're famous for being polite and for our comedians.<br>  <br>  I think that the UK is no better or worse than other countries with a similar way of life. We're rubbish at sports and we have a lot of drinking and teenage pregnancy, but we also have a fantastic sense of humour and a definite sense of justice.

PTdy6TWRaa	Parents don't usually give gifts to their boys at the Blue and Gold banquets but you certainly could mark the occasion on your own. It might be a very nice idea to give him something that he'll need in Boy Scouts such as a nice pocket knife, sleeping bag, knapsack, campcraft book or something to help organize his patch collection. Congrats to your son for making it through Cub Scouts and becoming a Boy Scout now!|`|86909ca7251ba8a3d5c3defa3b81072baa	Why  not  ?  I  think  you  should  !

If other parents don't give gifts, then you might want to give it to him before or after the ceremony.  If other parents also give gifts, then you could give it to him at the appropriate time.|`|AiLk0gk8aa	just give him i think...|`|lBw50ySpaa	I generally would buy him his new hat, t-shirt, sweat shirt, etc.  Anything cool from the scout store.

AA10797066	Well, I've got an answer for that, but do keep in mind that "auric photography" - such as the type we might find offered at carnivals, fairs, and conventions and stuff - is actually not photographing the aura. It's basically an infrared camera which takes pictures of heat signatures, and digitally colorizes them in order to appear as though they are actually photographs of your aura. Your friend might be aware of this. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, try a spot of pale emerald green, surrounded by a ring of hazy pink, over the heart. (Some may suggest the reverse of this color combo as well.) <br>  <br>  If you'd like to learn how to be able to see the aura with the unaided eye, there are ways. And don't let anyone fool you and tell you that you have to be "born special", or that you either have the talent or you don't. Anyone can see it. <br>  <br>  There's a really good article on getting to see it with your own eyes here; <a href="http://twurl.nl/fvamux" rel="nofollow">http://twurl.nl/fvamux</a>  <br>  <br>  This article focuses more on the lowest level of the aura, known as the Etheric body, which is the closest to the physical body in the planes of manifestation. The next higher level, the Astral body, is where you'd see more colors involved. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! ^_^|`|AA10652430	I'm not sure but I wish I could read AURAS.|`|MkZC5gd6aa	Probably green.

AA11941479	Our Blessed Mother told St. Bernadette at Lourdes,France in the early 1800's that mankind will be doing this workshop as putting the sperm and eggs together. This is not God' Will. These people were created by man and not from God. So these people have not soul as like animal don't have soul.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	That is not true, a sperm and egg do not each have half a soul. The soul of each human being is infused by God at the moment of conception. The egg and sperm are not carriers of the soul.|`|xxEhpytpaa	You've got to be kidding, right!!!  Only God can infuse the soul to the body. No halfsies. God bless you.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Don't be silly, sperm doesn't exist. They are microscopic tricks from Satan.|`|OC8NWQkyaa	If you are a materialist, this almost makes sense as the "soul is the form of the body" but it also has spiritual substance.  Spiritual substance has no parts, therefore there can be no half-soul.  Read Aristotle and Plato.  They knew a lot about the soul.  <br>  <br>  I'm writing this for the benefit of the reader.  The question is phrased to make the idea of the soul sound ridiculous.|`|2SvjxVlsaa	The other half souls get eaten by the baby.

Souls can't be divided or halved. they take up residence in the body as its being created in the womb to aid it and keep it alive, because you can't really be considered alive without a consciousness.|`|9jFXpA5faa	Well, The sperm will normally end up on a towel or tissue.. dry up and blow away. The eggs end up on a pad or a cork and they swim with the turds. Just like the stem cells that Bush says deserve to live so we cant save lives and heal the sick with them, They must be flushed down the toilet rather tan used to find cures for 88% of the worst diseases known to mankind. What a RETARD! This is why I say that Religion is just a form of mental illness. May be that's why the churches are against stem cell research, ...they don't want us cured of religion?
6Q4xh4F1aa	As a teacher or a student I would respect his faith and not give him a hard a time.  The kids in this cult are pretty much forced into a situation where they have to bring attention to themselves and suffer perceived persecution by not attending parties or participating in any patriotic activities.<br>  <br>  Pray for him and remember that he is being forced by his parents to conform to the thoguht and behavior control set out by the rules of their cult leaders.|`|VncSMLMpaa	You surely are not expected to debate his faith or that of his parents as a teacher.<br>  <br>  The means to debate and engage with anyone is through the word of God, the Bible. When people of differing Christians faiths really read the word of God thoroughly and keep reading it they will find that some church teaching does not come from Scripture, to name one doctrine - that of the Trinity. It was not the teaching of the Old Testament or the New yet men have added two and two together and made an alarmingly wrong number.<br>  <br>  I am not a J W but a Christadelphian and we get castigated as heretics because we don't believe some of the erroneous teachings of main line churches. Yet churches seem to ignore so many prophecies about Jesus and the coming kingdom.|`|yp8y1jrCaa	The best you can do, live in acceptance. JW's don't participate in some celebrations, so don't get your feelings hurt. If you send cupcakes in for a birthday - they may not participate but it's not a caring issue, rather it's their religious values. <br>  <br>  Other than that, children should be allowed to play together. <br>  <br>  A child, is a child, is a child - you should treat all with care and kindness regardless of religious affliatation.|`|AA11025703	I'm not quite sure what you are asking.<br>  <br>  If you are saying you are a teacher, then your religious beliefs don't exactly factor in, nor should they.  Be a teacher a Witness, or not, they are to show respect for ALL the children in their class, and for thier Rights to believe, even if not for the beliefs themselves.|`|AT4idiuPaa	Are you a pupil or a teacher?<br>  Anyway, I would try and show him the benefit of tertiary education and the necessity to prepare himself for life. This in case armageddon does not come on cue, as it has failed so many times before.|`|AA11974194	How do your religious beliefs come into this?  You say he is in my class, not yours.|`|AA10024451	Your question doesn't make much sense. Are you asking it as a teacher with a Jehovah's Witness student in your class, or are you asking it as someone with a Jehovah's Witness classmate?<br>  <br>  Basically you just need to respect his religious beliefs. As one of Jehovah's Witnesses he would not participate in the holiday celebrations or flag saluting of the un-Christian cult the majority of the class would be a part of. Remember, his upbringing by his parents is in complete harmony with God's Word the Bible, and by their training their son in God's ways, they're pleasing their Creator.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Jehovah's Witness children are usually well rounded out intelligent children that are able to give an explanation of their beliefs if the need arises. <br>  If you have a question you can ask the child (lets say for instance you were unsure whether he/she could participate in a certain activity) or if you prefer ask the parents.<br>  At any rate, you need to respect their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Accommodations? - The schools I have experience with (in UK) are very accommodating with regards to giving the child alternative activities while the class are engaged in things that conflict with Jehovah's Witness beliefs. <br>  <br>  <br>  In this century where children of many diverse religious beliefs are educated together, a qualified teacher should have no problem whatsoever in responding to this situation|`|3WYcPsm4aa	The only accommodations revolve around celebrating holidays and birthdays.  It does not excuse the child from doing homework and assignments, however.  (Had a girl try to tell me she couldn't do a math paper because it had Halloween stuff on it... told her to copy the problems to a sheet of plain paper and do it!)<br>  <br>  He would need to be excused if a child were to bring in birthday snacks to share with the class, and also during holiday celebrations.  I would not stop these celebrations because of one child.<br>  <br>  I would also make sure I spoke with the parents regarding their feelings about these topics.  <br>  <br>  Of course... all this is dependent upon the age of the student.  10 and younger.. talk to the parents.  Older than that..... it's a non-issue unless the student brings something up.|`|NOTc1b9saa	If we are told over and over that such and such is the truth, especially from a young age, it becomes our truth and THAT *truth*, fact or fiction,  becomes our *reality*..<br>  <br>  Many religions do that, which is why I am not religious, because religions keep people suspicious of each other and separated, even starting wars regularly in times past..<br>  <br>  Each religion says that THEIR way is the only way and has a book to prove it!..So the *battles* go on, with God*s desire for us to be One Human Family, irrespective of colour, creed, culture or sexual preference being ignored in favour pride and judgement of others different to us..Yes, I KNOW what THE book says, but who wrote it and altered it again and again and again since so as to reflect the negative beliefs of those men?<br>  <br>  I have been privileged to have many wonderful experiences over four decades and my direct experience with Angels and with God is that they only display TOTAL Unconditional Love, Love WITHOUT conditions or judgement, so it deeply saddens me when I read about and hear the fearful, judgemental and condemning teachings and comments which emanate from the different Christian religions, the very OPPOSITE of what God wishes and demonstrates through the life of Jesus, who taught about forgiveness and against judgement, lest we be judged..<br>  <br>  In short, to live as God wishes us to is to Live with Love and without judgement, with Love being the OPPOSITE of fear, the main teaching of religion, even saying that we must be *God Fearing*!..<br>  <br>  Well I choose NOT to fear Pure Unconditional Love and I try to treat all people as my sisters and brothers, whatever their beliefs and preferences, for they are none of my business..Labels separate people one from another and enable hatred, trouble and strife to continue on and on..<br>  <br>  Change begins one person at a time, so isnt it up to the person we see in the mirror to use the brain and discernment which God gave us to start that change of attitude, especially so if we are a teacher and role model?|`|qRFTEBlGaa	(not hard), witnesses children do not celebrate holidays, birthday, or salute the Flag. just don't try to force them to do otherwise.

How would you want your teacher to treat you, if your teacher had a different belief than yours? You would want respect right?<br>  <br>  Well this is what happened to me when i was in school.<br>  Well i am a JW since i was very young. I learned at a very young age this verse:<br>  <br>  (Acts 5:29) In answer Peter and the [other] apostles said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.<br>  <br>  Well when it came to the Flag Salute, i would stand up to show my respect, but my allegiance is to God alone. (Deut 5:9, Isa 42:8)<br>  Well my Teachers, 1st Grade, 2nd Grand and 3rd Grade all forced me to put my hands over my heart. They did this so much that i was sent to the Principles office repeadedly.<br>  Unlike the other students i would get up to show respect while my classmates made up songs that follow the Anthems tune, or putting thier hands over thier privates, thinking they're funny. But non of them ever got into trouble.<br>  <br>  Anyways, there are several cases in the US that have even gone to court. Even up to the Supreme Court regarding this matter.<br>  Lovell Vs. City of Griffen, 303 US 444 (1938)<br>  Schneider vs. State of New Jersey, 308 US 147 (1939)<br>  Carlton B Nicholls Vs. Mayor and School Committee of Lynn (Mass)<br>  Herring Vs. State Board of Education, New Jersey<br>  Johnson Vs. Town of Deerfield, (Mass)<br>  Minersville School District Vs. Gobitis<br>  Jones Vs. Opelika<br>  Murdock Vs. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania<br>  and <br>  Virginia State Board of Education Vs Barnette (1943)<br>  This last case was taken to the Supreme Court. It ruled "no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act thier faith therein."<br>  <br>  Well since this then, it has been illegal to force to "force citizens to confess by word or act thier faith therein."<br>  <br>  i'm guessing my teachers didnt know these laws, neither did my parents, if they did i would have taken them to court. I'm going to be a father soon and if my kid goes to the same thing i did, i will press charges.<br>  <br>  If you’re thinking that this has happened only in the US, you’re mistaken. Almost every nation has had force Witnesses to this. This is why No Jehovah’s Witness participated with the Nazi Regime but instead were sent to the Concentration camps, and even given their own badge. A purple Triangle.<br>  <br>  Anyways, some teachers later on knew what I’ve been thru and did accommodate me. When the pagan holidays began, they let me do extra credit. Or let me draw things that didn’t relate to the Unchristian holidays that were begin promoted. One teacher got angry at me for suggesting to draw something else other than witches and devils. We are there to learn, and if coloring is what is being done then why cant I color something different?<br>  <br>  Its sad to know that religious persectution is still being done.  A jewish kid was sent to the principles office because he had the Star of David as a necklace, he was asked to take it off. He then asked, the principle to ban all Christian Crosses on fellow students, he was sent home that day.<br>  <br>  My advice is, be respectful.

283tO9j9aa	Afternoon tea is the traditional cakes and tea, and it's usually around 3-4pm. However, a lot of British people say 'tea' to refer to our evening meal, in which case it would be a big cooked meal at about 5 or 6pm. Normally when people say 'tea time' instead of just tea they mean the evening meal.<br>  <br>  We drink tea whenever we want to really. People have tea breaks at work but in offices and similar jobs you just make a cup of tea or coffee for everyone when you all get bored or thirsty rather than having a set time.

Traditionally, people take tea at four or five o'clock in the afternoon with bread and jam or sandwiches and cake, but this custom has been largely dropped, apart from weekends, because most people are busy doing other things then. However, children coming home from school will have tea at that time, being hungry, and often that will be their main meal, with adults eating later. When "tea" is a main meal, it tends to be "high tea", which includes a cooked dish to make it more substantial and nourishing.|`|AqXadhUzaa	Tea Time is usually on Sundays.

It includes a student store, movie night, fall festival, cookbook and soda drive. All of them bring in money for our field trips and other activities our district can't support. The student store and the movie night make money monthly with very little work. The Squidoo lens is all of the very detailed articles that I wrote for eHow and is too much information to put here. Please check it out. I wrote the eHow articles not so much as to make money but to share what works for our school. Fundraising ideas are hard to find.

They were sold by their very own African people.Seriously some people should not learn history if they will use it to hold grudges .|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	I understand your point and agree. However President Obama has the advantage of knowing his African heritage where as most African  Americans do not. Perhaps naming our children is more in line with reclaiming our culture but the name we may not that of people who are our ancestors directly. The problem is Black people don't see ourselves as one race of people. This has never been our way. This is the problem that has us in the position we are in today if we are to be honest with ourselves. Therefore taking Swahili names maybe the hip thing to do but unless your ancestry is east African you are still taking on the names of other people. <br>  <br>  Black people must see themselves as one people. Then we will legitimately be able to share cultures within our race an not be seen as an outsider. Lastly I feel it is not the name that makes a person but people make names for themselves. There have been many great Black people who didn't have African names. This fact doesn't diminish the peoples greatness or accomplishments. Nor does it make them less a credit to themselves, their  families and their race...|`|GahpE5U2aa	*head-desk*<br>  <br>  As has already been said, you should have some type of cultural connection to your name.

"shaniqua" and all that other crap that people come up with is not at all african. I agree with that other guy. Slave traders didn't just come over and grab people. They were sold. Actually traded. Thats why its called the trans atlantic slave trade. Slaves were taken from africa to the americas (less than 5% to USA, most to Brazil (which has the 2nd largest population of blacks) and the caribbean) where they'd work on sugar and tobacco plantations etc. And the raw materials were taken to europe and processed and the finished product was used to trade for more slaves. People really need to get the truth instead of making up their own.<br>  <br>  About the names. Does it really matter? Yeah it was some fuked up sh*t that happened but sooner or later people in general need to realize that its in the past and just move forward.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	er well don't you think that these names should be relevant to you? i am nigerian but even i don't know if i will give all my children nigerian names as culturally i am english. i mean i welcome the idea but in that case, you should learn more about the culture of where the chosen name comes from so you can tell your child about it later.|`|QdwMhvpCaa	You should name your kids names from whatever culture you want. For instance, I was named after the only person who was genuinely nice to my mom in high school (people were mean because she wasn't a slut and wasn't rich). My sister was named after Alia in Dune because my parents always found the name interesting. My bro was named after my grandfather. My older sister, Jessica, was named after my grandpa Jesse. Alot of times, people name their kids after family members and such. Also, with so much diversity inthe world nowadays, people can look up different names on the internet and pick one that just feels right. It's not about race, it's about giving your kid a name. My bro's middle name was chosen because of the meaning, as was mine.<br>  Look at it like what was said in Romeo and Juliet : That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, or something like that. It's just a name.|`|46fouwFfaa	Not all European whites are racist. Obama is not African American, his father is actually Kenyan so he was given a Swahili name (that's the language they use in Kenya).

SDDgbtQ4aa	Spells are much more than just lighting a candle and reciting a catchy little rhyme.  The driving force behind working an effective spell is the energy one raises, focuses/directs, and releases into the spell. <br>  <br>  I could take a spell I found online and tweak it a little to suit my personal need and cast it effectively - but then, I've been studying and practicing magic for some 15 years.  <br>  <br>  Of course, that also depends on the kind of spell it is.  Some of these "spells" you see online are simply not possible.  The "turn into a mermaid spell" for instance.  Magic works with nature, not against it - and it is not possible to change what species you are with spells and magic.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, if you've no idea how to work a spell, then no spell will likely work for you.|`|Sgz5bGzEaa	<a href="http://takingforyou.uk.to" rel="nofollow">http://takingforyou.uk.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|3d5276b9d8911b56d9f4622be95c0f2faa	do any spells actually work?|`|mugPlM3Zaa	you can try on me if you're willing ;) :P|`|dFBccLExaa	Depends on the site.

Allah only, has Free Will, He Wills whatever He likes and it will always happen as He wills. We have something called, "Free choice." The difference is that what Allah "Wills" always happens and what we choose may or may not happen. We are not being judged on the outcome of things, we are being judged on our choices. This means that at the core of everything will always be our intentions. Whatever we intended, is what we will have the reward for. Each person will be judged according to what Allah gave them to work with, how they used it and what they intended to do with it.<br>  <br>  As regards the actual "Judgment Day" - Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom's weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom's weight of evil will be seen too.<br>  <br>   On That Day (of judgment) mankind will proceed in scattered groups and they will be shown their deeds.<br>   So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.<br>   And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. [Noble Quran 99:6-8] <br>  <br>  The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.<br>  <br>  He could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance.

fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,<br>  <br>  First, to be fair your question is flawed because it demands too strict of an answer. It’s like the lawyer asking the man: “Have you stopped beating your wife–yes or no?” Your question could be turned around and demand just the opposite conclusion: “I want to be shown where Christ said ‘I am not almighty God.’” Just because we don’t get the exact evidence we demand doesn’t meant that there is no evidence.<br>  <br>  Now, the preponderance of evidence from the Inspired Word of God itself makes it irrefutable that Jesus is not equal to Almighty God. As a divine person he is called "god" but never is he placed equal to his God and Father.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there is not one clear verse in the Bible that teaches that God is made up of three persons equal in power, knowledge or eternity. Even Trinitarian scholars realize that there is not one scripture which teaches the Trinity and that it was a later addition to True Christianity:<br>  <br>  A Short History of Christian Doctrine; Bernhard Lohse:<br>  "As far as the New Testament is concerned, one does not find in it an actual doctrine of the Trinity. "<br>  <br>  Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics:<br>  "At first the Christian faith was not Trinitarian...It was not so in the apostolic and sub-apostolic ages, as reflected in the N.T. and other early Christian writings."<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of Scriptures which explicitly state that Jesus is inferior to Almighty God. For example:<br>  <br>  Jesus has a *God* over him (Mic.5:4, Jn.20:17, Rom.15:6, Rev.3:12). Can Almighty God have a God? Anyone who is said to have a God over him must be less than Almighty!<br>  <br>  Scriptures show that Jesus did not know what Almighty God knew on earth or in heaven (Mk.13:32, Rev.1:1; Mat 20:23).<br>  <br>  He always had to be *given* power or authority from a superior! (Mt.28:18; 11:27, Jn. 5:22; 17:2; 3:35; 2Pet.1:17).<br>  <br>  He could not "save" himself  (Jn.12:26-27, Heb.5:7-10).<br>  <br>  He could not do anything on his own and he can only speak what he was "taught" by the Father (Jn. 5:19; 6:38; 8:28). He was not eternal God but was "begotten" (Jn. 1:18).<br>  <br>  How could the Father command him to do anything (Jn. 12:49; 14:31; 15:10; 12:49; 10:18.)<br>  <br>  Jesus identifies himself as the one "sent" by a superior, he did not come of his own accord (Jn.8:16,29,42,). This superior is identified as "Father" and "God" and is shown to be Jehovah (Jn.8:54). Is not the sender superior to the one sent? (Jn.13:16).<br>  <br>  What else would Jesus have to say to show that he was not equal with God? Try as we may we cannot seen anything here but the Christ's denial he was equal to God.<br>  <br>  Even when Jesus is as high as he will ever get 1Cor.15:27,28 shows that Jesus will still be "subject" to his God in the same way we are "subject" to him (See RSV). If Jesus were equal to Almighty God why was he not powerful enough to subject things to himself? (1Cor.15:27, Eph.1:17,22, Hb.1:3).<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see, the Scriptures put so many limitations on our Lord that it is impossible to place him in an Almighty position. Every thing he does is done only because his God and Father *allows* him to do them. No one has to (or can) give The Almighty God such power or authority. If these things were said of Jehovah the Almighty God they would be blasphemous.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The Jews understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, that was why they wanted to kill him for blasphemy. Whenever Jesus spoke of a unique Father-Son relationship between God the Father and Himself, the Jews understood Him to be claiming equality with God the Father. <br>  <br>  Jesus spoke to the Jews in their language. He communicated to them on their terms. They said things in a round about way rather than directly like we do in the West and they understood Jesus was be claiming to be deity. <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus (quoting the Old Testament) claimed that God is the only legitimate object of worship: “Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.” (Matthew 4:10; Deut 6:13), but Jesus accepted worship many times, including just a short time later when the disciples all worship Him (Matthew 14:33). <br>   <br>  Additionally:<br>   <br>  Jesus accepted worship from Thomas (John 20:28); all the angels are told to worship Jesus (Heb. 1:6); wise men worshiped Jesus (Matt. 2:11); a ruler bowed before Him in worship (Matt. 9:18); a blind man worshiped Him (John 9:38); Mary Magdalene worshiped Him (Matt. 28:9); and the disciples worshiped Him (Matt. 28:17). <br>   <br>  Note carefully what we never find Jesus saying. He never corrected anyone by saying something like “Woah guys, you’ve got it all wrong, I may be a good teacher but don’t worship me!”<br>   <br>  However, in Acts we find the early Christians doing exactly what Jesus didn’t do, objecting strongly when people try to worship them. In Acts 10, Peter goes to visit a man named Cornelius, where we read: “As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.“ (Acts 10:25-26) This is exactly what we don’t find Jesus saying! A similar example occurs to Paul and Barnabas in Acts 14:11-15.<br>   <br>  All the available evidence points to the fact that Christ did claim to be God. The eyewitnesses who heard these claims died horrible deaths for refusing to deny their validity. No liberal scholar has ever proposed an adequate explanation as to how a legend that Jesus claimed to be God could develop while the original apostles (those who personally knew Christ) were still alive and leading the new church. Legends take centuries to develop into dogma. Any attempted origination of legends cannot get started while honest eyewitnesses are still alive (especially if these honest eyewitnesses hold positions of authority in the church). <br>  <br>  If Jesus never meant to claim to be God, then He was one of the poorest communicators who ever lived. <br>  <br>  If Jesus was misunderstood by His listeners, He should have clarified His words. A clear and articulate representation of His words would have been in His best interest seeing that He was executed for blasphemy (Mark 14:60-64).|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

That was, in a nutshell, why he was crucified - for blasthemy :<br>  <br>  Joh 10:33  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.<br>  <br>  - because the Jews understood very well exactly what he was claiming for himself, even if we don't see it.<br>  <br>  Looking at the context of Jesus at the feast of dedication in Jerusalem, we see in ch.10 verse 24 the Jews appealing to Jesus to say plainly whether he was the Messiah or not.<br>  <br>  What is his response? 'I told you, and you do not believe'.  What did he tell them? - he told them that he was the Messiah, and they did not believe him, that is what he was saying.<br>  <br>  Notice that, in verse 28 he makes a remarkable statement : 'I give them eternal life' - now, who is able to do these things, give his sheep eternal life?  Who but God can give life, and ensure that they never perish, nor are ever snatched out of his hand?<br>  <br>  Then, in verse 29, Jesus states that God, his Father, is greater than all (who would oppose him - ie. snatch the sheep, etc.), and it is his Father - ie. their God - who will secure the sheep.  Then Jesus really 'nails it' as far as the Jews are concerned, for he says 'I and my Father are one'.<br>  <br>  One what? we might ask.  Well, the Jews know for sure that Jesus is claiming to be One God with the Father (ie. equality - see John 5:18) and that was 'a step too far' as far as they were concerned, so that was why they took up stones to stone him (vs.31) - for blasthemy - vs.33.<br>  <br>  This was not the first time that Jesus nearly died at the hands of the Jews.  This happened in the Temple, too, when he had another exchange with the Jews and he managed to slip away in the crowd, all because he took upon his lips the holy name of God which had been revealed to Moses - I AM (Ex.3:14):<br>  <br>  Joh 8:58  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.<br>  <br>  And what did the Jews do? - they again took up stones to throw at him.<br>  <br>  You see, he was not only claiming to be the Messiah (which was bad enough), but what really did it with them was that he was saying that Messiah was not just Son of God, but equal with God.<br>  <br>  The third example is where Jesus stood before the High Priest, and the High Priest did something which, legally, he was not allowed to do.  He put Jesus on the spot and said 'I adjure you, by the most high God' - ie. he commanded him, in his office as High Priest, to say directly whether he was the Son of God:<br>  <br>  Mt 26:63  But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.<br>  27: Jesus said to him 'It is as you said'.  Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven (he was quoting Daniel 7:13-14).<br>  Mt 26:65  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.<br>  <br>  Now, it is important to realise that, in this conversation, Jesus was not only claiming to be the Son of God, but also co-equal with the Father.  How is this?  Because the Jews were monotheistic and only worshipped One God (that is why the High Priest rent his clothes and shouted 'blasthemy'), but Jesus, in claiming to be the Messiah, was also claiming divinity, for he not only claimed to be the Son of God, but he also added that he would sit on the same throne as the Father.  The High Priest understood what 'sitting on the right hand' meant - it meant co-rulership - for eastern thrones were bigger than thrones we know, and could accommodate more than one.  However, to sit on the throne of the universe alongside God and thereafter rule with him made the implications too much for the High Priest to stomach!<br>  <br>  To understand Jesus's claims better, you need to understand the Jewish mind, and this is difficult for Gentiles.  But, as a Jew, Jesus would never claim, in so many words, that he was God, for no-one could, lawfully, take that holy name on his lips.  <br>  <br>  He could not, would not say 'I am JHWH' or 'Hashem' or 'G-d', but instead he said 'I am' ('he' added) and, just for saying 'I am' he was nearly stoned.<br>  <br>  When he said 'I am (he)' the temple guards fell backwards.  Why? because he did not say 'I am he' - he actually said 'I am' :<br>  <br>   Joh 18:6  As soon then as he had said unto them, I am (he), they went backward, and fell to the ground.<br>  <br>  Jesus, of course, in the very ways he expressed his teaching, was clearly claiming to be 'more than a prophet', for no prophet had ever made such claims about himself as he did, if you read the prophets.  So, he was either a madman, or who he said he was.<br>  <br>  But what you need t|`|uO0knmZOaa	PROOF OF THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST From the Koran and the Bible<br>   <br>  God began by choosing a chaste woman, Mary (Maryam).

See Luke 1:28, 30:34, 41-44, 48-49, and 54-55. Also says Qur'an 3:42, "....O Mary! Allah has CHOSEN thee, and PURIFIED thee, and PREFERRED thee ABOVE ALL THE WOMEN OF CREATION".<br>     <br>  After that, God settled His soul (Ruh) inside His word (Kalimat) which he had put in the womb of Mary, who had been spiritually qualified as we have seen earlier. That was how  Mary conceived Jesus. That was to enable the divine attribute have human features through her for the humans to understand Him better (Hence only Jesus is Biblicaly and Qur'anically declared as GOD's WORD and GOD's RUH (Spirit): John 1:1, 14:8:23, Phl. 2:5-8; and the Qur'an 4:171, 2:253, etc. (By implication, Jesus' flesh is not actually biological but God's Word; similarly, his life is not actually human's but from God's own as we will see more later).<br>   <br>  Therefore, even after his humanly birth, Jesus was declared as much superior to angels and, in fact, God said, "Let ALL God's angels WORSHIP him (Jesus)" (Heb. 1:6; 1Pet. 3:22; Mat. 4:11), as was Adam, of course, in Qur'an 2:30-34.<br>   <br>  Thus, apparently, Jesus was a human, the rationality and aim of his humanized birth. See Rom. 8:3-6; Heb. 2:16-18. Also, says Allah according to Qur'an 6:9, "Had We appointed an ANGEL our messenger, We ASSUREDLY had made him LIKE A MAN SO THAT HE MIGHT SPEAK TO (associate with) MEN...."<br>   <br>  Muslims often cite John 5:30-31; Mark 13:32-33 and John 1428 etc as disproofs of Christ's divinity. But, logically, these verses, rather than disprove Jesus' divinity, expressed the anticipated and expected demonstrations of the character that was Jesus-in-exemplary-typical-human-nature and , therefore , in accordance with God's programme as stated in the Qur'an 6:9 and:-<br>   <br>  (1) Phil. 2:6, "Who (Jesus) being in very nature God, did NOT consider equality with God something to grasp, 7 But made himself NOTHING, taking the very nature of a SERVANT, being made in human likeness 8, and found in appearance as a MAN, he HUMBLED himself and became OBEDIENT to the death, even death in the cross"<br>   <br>  (2) Heb. 2:16, "For surely it is NOT ANGELS that he (Jesus) helps, but Abraham's descendants. 17 FOR THIS REASON HE (GOD) HAD TO MAKE HIM (JESUS) LIKE HIS BROTHERS IN EVERY WAY in order that......" (Compare Qur'an 6:9)<br>   <br>  (3) Rom. 8:3, "(Jesus)....in the LIKENESS OF A SINFUL MAN.........."<br>  So, in the light of these verses, it should be clear that Jesus' humanized acts did not mean that he was actually a human being (John 8:23) but were the divinely designs that were to make Jesus not unnecessarily scare the humans but, rather be their SOURCE OF INSPIRATIONS.<br>   <br>  In other words, if Jesus were to act God-the-father again even when haven purposely transformed into a man, the transformation would logically be nonsense.<br>  The Holy Bible reveals relationship between Adam and Jesus thus, "The FIRST  Adam became a LIVING SOUL, the LAST Adam (Jesus) a QUICKENING SPIRIT", 1 Cor. 15:45. Therefore, to understand the nature of Jesus more, we must go back to the Adam's case.<br>   <br>  Thus, when God breathed life into Adam (Qur'an 38:73-78 and Gen. 2:7), he (God) declared him His (God's) own IMAGE/LIKENESS (Gen. 2:7) or His VICEROY (Qur'an 2:30). Also, according to Qur'an 28:37-38, 15:39-44; 17:61-62; 7:11-13 and 2:34, Allah instructed ALL the angels to WORSHIP Adam on the ground that He (Allah) had breathed something of His SpIRIT into Adam for a soul (see Heb. 1:2-6, for the same instruction in respect of Jesus). In fact, according to these Qur'anic verses, Satan's curse and demotion are God's reaction to his (Satan's) refusal to prostrate himself before Adam.<br>   <br>  Therefore, Biblically and Qur'anically Adam, whose flesh was made from just the sand (Gen. 2:7, Qur'an 28:72), was notwithstanding such GLORIOUS initially. And, logically, the glorious qualification came from what God breathed in him.<br>   <br>  However, Adam did not pass Satanic test but sinned (that shows some relative weakness in him), thereby lost his INITIAL STATUS and therefore was ordered out of MOST EXALTED DWELLING, the Garden of Eden(Qur'an 7:19-24, Gen. 3:1-24). But Jesus passed all the Satanic tests (Mt.4:1-11, Heb. 4:15; Qur'an 19:19), which logically implies comparative superiority in him.<br>   <br>  Therefore, the fact that SOIL is the comparative parent of Adam, who, again, could not pass Satanic test, sinned and was  demoted; and Mary, the SUPERIOR among all women, is the comparative parent of Jesus, who, again, passed all the Satanic tests, did not sin and therefore was NEVER demoted, given that both Adam and Jesus got their souls unbiologically from God directly; it follows that whatever type of soul God gave Adam wa|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	He did not claim to be God.

LuN1unJ3aa	Many people believe that the Catholic Church has not been overly forthright over the years. A lot of this has to do with the obvious "cover-up" involved with keeping cases of child abuse on the part of clergy quiet until it was forced into the open via very public lawsuits.<br>  <br>  There are also a number of people who believe that the Roman Catholic Church has hidden or destroyed manuscripts of potential scriptures because they counter the practices of the church or were declared to be heretical during the Ecumenical councils.<br>  <br>  Like other "secrets" that people "know" about, they wouldn't be secret if people knew about them, but it would be nice if the RCC provided electronic scans (images)* of all ancient writings that were reviewed by the councils and rejected for one reason or another. It would serve two purposes: 1 - it would provide the world with a wealth of information that might otherwise not be available and 2 - it would give the world an opportunity to see if it agrees with the choices made concerning the scriptural canon.<br>  <br>  There will always be claims of "secret" information about Jesus that is being "hidden" by the Vatican. It is part of human nature to develop conspiracy theories.<br>  <br>  The RCC did not do itself any favors by making a fuss over The Da Vinci Code, since it is a work of fiction. Instead of simply declaring it fiction and letting it go at that, they made a big deal over it, which gave the work credibility in the minds of RCC critics.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm not sure about your numbers. Forty percent seems on the high side to me but then, I am not concerned about whether the Church is concealing information or not, mostly because I have access to scholarly studies of early Church writings by people who evidently did have access to that information and wrote about it. And not everything is readily accessible via the internet.<br>  <br>  Edit Add: *The dead sea scrolls have been scanned and can be purchased on CD for personal study or whatever. That is the kind of scans that I am talking about. Make the ancient manuscript contents of the Vatican Library available on CD for those interested (and who have the money to pay for it).|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	the da Vince code is a fictional work  but you can ask any scholar of religious history and find what is omitted from the business of religion. the dead sea scrolls were withheld from the public for a good time and in the compilation of the bible many scriptures were burned . not to mention the original scriptures don't exist but translations subject to changes and interpretations in translation that are not correct sometimes . if you look to the libraries during the time of christ you will not find mention of he nor his followers but the only historical references are mention in reference to his legend and hence not verifying pieces of literature . how long was the new of the family tomb thought to be jesus's family's grave withheld from the public and them poo pooed as not even possibly accurate . there is a much dispute among scholars as what the christ may have even actually said . excuse me I have to go walk on water and deliver some five hundred cloned fish to a political rally that's running out of wine.

1Vih78dZaa	You say "every time" you dream of something it comes true, but it seems the best example you can give is how you recall dreaming about getting ill from eating a taco (and how extraordinarily unusual would that really be?) and then there being a food safety scare associated with one chain of restaurants. Did you actually get ill? Did your friends haul you off to Taco Bell to eat, but you refused to do so because of the dream while they did eat and got ill?<br>  <br>  Seems to me that if your dreams were really so spectacularly accurate in predicting things, you should be able to come up with some examples far more interesting that those you've given.<br>  <br>  Our brains are very good at confabulating: making us believe we remember things that never actually happened. If you have a "gift" for prophecy, then the only way you're going to be able to make anything useful of it is if you discipline yourself to keep a dream diary and track how well your dreams actually reflect things that happen in your life before they come to pass.<br>  <br>  If you are really all that talented, you can expect fame and fortune as your abilities prove that all science believes about the linearity of time is overthrown by your predictive abilities.|`|GGtWK3R4aa	Yes you are.

Every morning immediately after you wake up, write down all the dreams you've had that night. Then, every time you observe something in your waking life that corresponds to a dream, write that down too. <br>  <br>  The thing to remember is though, your dreams are a reflection of your waking thoughts - which are influenced by the things you see and do during the day, even if you didn't take much notice of them at the time. It can be very easy to muddle up when you've had a dream, and when something occurs in real life. By making the diary and writing everything down you can be more sure in your own mind about what is happening.<br>  <br>  I would make the diary for a couple of months, and then show it to someone you trust - a parent, guardian, teacher, doctor etc and ask them what they think.|`|TOGgD7XAaa	omg! this happens to me, but i have dreams and they happen a few years later. and for some strange reason, those dreams always stand out in a way.

There's no love lost between the Arabs and the Jews!  <br>  <br>  Would your prefer Roddenberry to be like the modern-day lefties who tells us to bottle our true feelings and lie about how we just love everyone, no matter who they are or what they are?  Bad behavior begets bad reactions!  Bad behavior should be rebuffed!  <br>  <br>  I say, let it open up dialogue.  WHAT did Roddenberry see and feel that would make him think this way?  Is it valid?  Are the Jews the victims or are they the instigators?

2577f0992ce02aa0bade7b777b040d17aa	Hi, a white snake generally refers to the healing abilities, so your mother, and the cat, and most likely you have some healing gifts; it works, although helpful medicines might taste awful. So your dream probably tells you that you have the ability to heal your relationship problems . . . Please meditate or day-dream on it.<br>  I hope it helps.|`|Khcu3oVwaa	Snakes are supposed to represent truthfulness, so perhaps your mother let something slip. The snakes coming from everywhere might mean that the truth is coming out, or that you feel that you need to tell the truth to someone and that not telling is affecting you. The largest snake, on the ceiling, could mean a family secret, perhaps about your domestic life, or perhaps just a truth 'close to home'. <br>  <br>  You also have to consider what certain things mean specifically for you. A white snake for you could mean something entirely different for another person.|`|867c92ea42d5f2c7cf5f2121e2d57963aa	It'll be hard for others to answer this as the "symbolism" in your dreams are....well....yours...lol.<br>  <br>  Pick at the dream peice by peice and think about what it means to you. <br>  From what I gather, you feel this is regarding your relationship troubles and your mother. <br>  Snakes scare you and your mother putting one out there could be you thinking she is setting fear in your way...or putting up a road block for you...trying to slow you down.<br>  <br>  With "fear", it is something that we don't really think too much about, it just kinda is there. Your mother placeing "fear" into your home could symbolize her own fears that should be recognizzed by you regarding this relationship/s.<br>  <br>  Look at everything in your dream, items, colours, ect..ect..and figure out what they mean to you and it may clairify the dream a little more...hope that helps

biFCKGAcaa	It is not very clear as to who is the father of Sugriv. <br>  <br>  Sugreev and Baali were two brothers. Baali was elder and Sugreev was younger. Their mortal father's name was RIKSH RAAJ. Otherwise Baali was Indra's son, and Sugreev was SOORYA's son. <br>  <br>  Please read the details of Birth of Baali and Sugreev -<br>  <br>  How these two brothers were born is an interesting story. On the peak of Sumeru Parvat there is Brahmaa's court - in 100 Yojan wide area. Once Brahmaa Jee was doing Tapasyaa, two drops of tears fell from His eyes. Brahmaa Jee took them in His hand wiped His hand with His body. Later when He shook His hand one drop fell on the ground. A Vaanar was born from that drop. He said to Vaanar - "You stay on the peak of this mountain. After some time it will be good to you."<br>  <br>  The Vaanar went away and started living there on fruits and flowers. He used to offer flowers to Brahmaa Jee daily. Thus a long time passed. One day Riksh Raaj got thirsty so he looked for a pond, and as he bent down to drink water, he saw his shadow in that water. He thought "Who is this my enemy here? I will kill him." And he jumped into the water. But when he came out he found himself changed into a beautiful woman. <br>  <br>  By chance both Soorya and Indra were passing from there. Both saw that beautiful woman, and had a desire to have her. Indra's semen got ejaculated and fell on the head of the woman, so a Vaanar was born from that. Because he was born from her hair, he was called Baali (Baal means hair in Hindi); while Sun's semen got ejaculated and fell on her neck, so another Vaanar was born from there and was called Sugreev (Su means good, and Greev means neck in Hindi). <br>  <br>  Indra gave a qualitative gold necklace to Baali and Soorya appointed Hanumaan in the service of Sugreev. After this that woman again became Riksh Raaj. Thus Riksh Raaj was both their mother as well as mortal father. After some time Riksh Raaj went to Brahmaa Jee. Brahmaa Jee asked him to live in Kishkindhaa Nagaree and sent a messenger with him to appoint his elder son as the king of that Nagaree. Vaanar were already living there. So all started living there. Baali was appointed the king of Vaanar. After some time Riksh Raaj died.  -|`|DV7wLZLraa	Surya, the Sun God|`|8CZuiU8maa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

n6nSjHXBaa	If Canada ever decided to get rid of the Monarchy Canada would likely turn into a republic with a presidential system.  Depending on what model the Canadian people might choose, the head of state would either be a directly elected president, or a president who is chosen by the elected officials.<br>  <br>  Getting rid of the Queen would mean that we would no longer have an apolitical head of state.  Currently the Queen, and the Governor General (whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister) is not bound to any political party, and can represent the whole of the Canadian population instead of the fraction of people who voted for a president.  More importantly, the Crown can perform its constitutional role in an unpartizan way, free from political motivation.  The Crown functions as an important check and balance on excessive political power.<br>  <br>  If Canada were to elect its head of state then the role of the Crown as being above politics would be gone.  We would have a president who could possibly wield as much power as the American President.  Right now the Crown is subject to the will of Parliament, but if we had a president he/she would likely be able to use the reserve powers that currently belong to the Crown and are rarely used (like vetoes of bills that pass the House of Commons and the Senate), just like the American President regularly does.  An important check and balance of our political system would be gone.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	During the early years of Canada's history documents were signed that turned over ownership of great chucks of Canada from the natives to the Royal family. <br>  <br>  If Canada was to become a Republic these documents would become invalid, this is the main reason Canada still has a monarchy.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	nothing|`|364815ba0e4e52ba14aa1cef4ad4e5a0aa	Life would continue as is.

The out gay guys know the body language that is subconscious.  Closet cases aren't even aware of them.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to go into serious detail because it's not that important to you as a straight guy.  But one dead giveaway are the eyes.  Straight men will not hold eye contact more than a fraction of a second.  A gay man holds it just a tad longer.  And it's difficult to consciously control that, so it's a good indicator.

That guy posted while I was typing my response or I'd have included him in the idiot portion of my answer. <br>  Intelligent Design advocates literally have an industry working on scouring scientists' work to find any cracks, moments of doubt, etc etc. Then they flaunt these "admissions" as evidence to the veracity of their doctrine (which is what it is, not a theory). And merely because there are scientists out there who believe in the god-of-the-gaps mentality, doesn't prove that evolution is wrong.<br>  Evolution is merely the astronomy fight of the 16-17th Century. ID advocates have yet to actually present any hard evidence to their "a gap is here, so we'll insert God" approach to science. Evolution, to be sure, is not perfect, but no theory is, but merely pointing out its failures, without actually presenting real alternatives or dismissing the literal library of information that bolsters the theory, does not disprove it. And touting a few creation scientists doesn't prove anything either and those scientists should be ashamed of themselves, as they know theory requires evidence not supposition.|`|LF4vun1maa	I'm surprised they had a biochemist and a biologist in there.

Look, the world is chock full of systems and sub-systems.  I am a systems analyst by trade.  Every system that I analyze is man-made.  No one is "threatened" by their design because MAN MADE THEM!  People say, "OF COURSE they have a design, you idiot!  They were designed!"<br>  <br>  That's sort of the point that Christians make when pointing to all of these other systems and sub-systems:<br>  <br>  A) Each has a design unto itself and<br>  B) The designs work both independent of each other and in conjunction with one another; e.g., the eye is a marvelous design.  Unto itself, it has it's own design and it works with the brain to process the information.  <br>  <br>  You all mock Christians for our belief in God.  But it's frighteningly common to hear folk of your ilk say, "That was lucky!"  Or that happened "purely by chance."  We understand the concept of God.  At least to our poor power's ability to understand Him.  We KNOW that God is a force!  He's a force for good!  We see Him pitted against Satan, as a force for evil.  They are TRUE forces, like the wind, a collision, centrifigal force, etc.  We're talking true forces.  <br>  <br>  When we look at evolution, the big bang, etc.  We GET that we're supposed to take God out of the equation.  So, we ask ... WHAT put that into motion?  What caused this intricate and complex design and that one?  How is it that you explain these billions of systems and sub-systems working together in such incredible harmony?  Is it luck?  Forgive us, but we both jeer and sneer that you don't feel compelled to explain that!<br>  <br>  I'll give you one simple example:<br>  <br>  You everything to start with nothing.  Then a big bang supposedly set in place a set of circumstance that makes life POSSIBLE.  Then that first life form, a primordial slime.  Okay.  Then from this primordial slime comes first one life form then another in a beautiful system we call evolution.  <br>  <br>  Here's the thing.  What tells the bee to pollunate plants?  What tells the insects to till the earth, which aerates the soil?  How is it that a MALE and a FEMALE of every species evolved separately and beautifully simultanesously?  Under the Christian believe, the Bible is CLEAR that God told man about procreation.  It's EXPLAINED.  In this world of happy chance and circumstance and dare we say luck then ... how is it that not only males and females evolved, but how did they figure out to hook up to make more of their own kind?  <br>  <br>  I mean SERIOUSLY!  You think that just happened?  You mock us for our stupidity and our "blind faith," but if you start in the present with all the technologies and the people and everything we see today and then go back to what you believe to be the beginning, even before the primordial slime and you try to go step by step, piece by piece through explaining everything, how it all worked out, it becomes pure folly of the highest order.<br>  <br>  Are you sure Christians are the ones sold a bill of goods?

That's my two cents.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, its a bit like saying there must have been a BIG plan behind the whole of human civilisation because it is now so complex. When in reality it was built rather willy nilly by many individuals working independently.<br>  <br>  Complex things can grow organically, without the need for some grand plan behind them.<br>  <br>  If you follow evolution closely, you will see that the most simplest of changes were the ones which took the longest. Single cell organisms dominated the planet for billions of years, while complex ones are only a few hundred million years old.<br>  <br>  Complexity is really an exponential curve. 2 cells by 2 cells = 4 variations, so change is extremely slow, but 100 cells by 100 allows for 1000 different combinations, and 1 million by 1 million allows for enormous possibilities. <br>  So as the complexity increases, the more variations that become possible, and the faster the rate of change.<br>  <br>  I can't really see why complexity must therefore be proof of some master plan.<br>  The human brain can't naturally work itself around the meaning of billions of years, and the possibilities that allows for. And for some people anything they can't quite grasp must be Divine.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	You have no need to research quotes to know that Xians refer to god as the source of and for everything.

AlybkawCaa	Most of the apostles and disciples were afraid to show up, because He the Spirit of Truth (Who is Jesus here in Spirit) was then not poured out upon all flesh to make them spiritually strong and bold !  He Jesus the Spirit of all Truth came worldwide about 50 days later, at Pentecost. (May 18, AD30 - and now ! - and forever with us Truth-lovers !) <br>  <br>  You are correct, if Jesus had told them that He had to become a bleeding, dying sacrifice to change God's heart from stern justice to love and mercy; then these apostles and disciples would have all gone to the terrible scene of crucifixion torture to the death and shouted: Yeah ! He is dying !  Wonderful !  and the enemies of Jesus and the Roman soldiers all would have joined in - as one happy blood-seeking family -- but for very different reasons !  Jesus would have told his followers all of this, and how they could see such a great bleeding "sacrificial Lamb" to save them all, without getting the many enemies of Jesus mad ! They would be very welcome !<br>  <br>  That did not happen, because Jesus never taught any of his followers that He was to be a blood sacrifice to appease an angry God !<br>  <br>  In our Master Jesus here in Spirit, we all should now and forever really know that God the Father of all is just as infinitely loving and all-merciful and eternally kind as our Sovereign Savior Jesus Christ is !<br>  <br>  Jesus message is God's saving Light and Their Divine love for all humans to be granted eternal Life just for having faith in Jesus' Power to do this !  not a dark message of bloody death of our perfect Son of God Jesus Christ to remove God's falsely alleged "wrath" according to Paul's barbaric "atonement doctrine" !|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Lots of reasons.  One of which, perhaps those who were not there understood what must happen, but didn't want to see it happen with their own eyes.  It was very unjust, and bloody... awfully hard to take.  I can see many not wanting to be there, but praying in isolation instead.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, they may have met the same fate if they attended, and it was not their time.<br>  <br>  The important thing, is that they were there when He came to them, after He had risen.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Jesus told them in advance how he would die and told them that they would all run and hide.<br>  <br>  They were all terrified that they too would be cruicified.<br>  <br>  The fact that all but one ran way, and that Peter denied Jesus 3x, makes the report of Jesus resurrection all the more believable.<br>  <br>  And later, all of the Apostles who ran off, were in fact killed for their report that Jesus rose from the dead.|`|mNyhRGowaa	Because we are predictable beings when it comes to life and death especially by torture we are afraid of it. and it also goes to show that they did not know what Jesus was really here for till after wards.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Because they were afraid and did not understand until later on when the Holy Spirit came upon them at Pentecost.<br>  <br>  Simple question.............simple answer.<br>  <br>  See Acts chapter 2|`|N6cCc9dOaa	Jesus did not ask any one to show up.His apostles had "Free Will" like every one else.They were very scared so they hid.Only St.John ,And the two Marys were there at the foot of the cross.|`|TD7x9Ypgaa	They were too busy running for their worthless lives!<br>  <br>  Cowards.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Many of them had not been born yet.|`|IvJvQi2Saa	The bible shows the crucifixion you just didn't read it properly!

LZF76BLXaa	1) Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 5.1.1 and the Shanti Mantra  in the beginning of Ishavasya Upanishad : <br>  <br>  "Om Poornam Adah Poornam Idam<br>  Poornaat Poornam Udachyate<br>  Poornasya Poornam Aadaay<br>  Poornam Evaa Vashishyate"<br>  <br>  (i) Simple Meaning:<br>  <br>  'You are the fullness. There is fullness, here is fullness. From the fullness, the fullness is born. Remove the fullness from the fullness and the fullness alone remains.'<br>  <br>  (ii) Implied Meaning:<br>  <br>  That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite. The infinite proceeds from the infinite. (Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe), it remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone. <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  That (the invisible Brahman) is full, this (the visible Brahman) is full.  This full (visible Brahman) proceeds from that full (invisible Brahman). On grasping the fulness of this full (visible Brahman) there is left that full (invisible Brahman)<br>  <br>  (iii) Higher Level Meaning:<br>  <br>  The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance. <br>  <br>  2) Word by word meaning:<br>   <br>  "Purnam" = complete<br>  <br>  "Adah" =that<br>  <br>  "Purnamadah" = "that" is complete.<br>  <br>  "That" is referred to "Supreme Soul- Brahman"<br>  <br>  ( what we generally refer as God)<br>  <br>  God is complete means what? Complete means He is self sufficient. He is Eternal. He IS always there. He does not need any external agency to support Him.<br>  <br>  "Idam" = "this"<br>  "Purnam Idam" =This is also Complete<br>  "This" indicates the "Atman" <br>  "ATMAN"= the individual Soul- which resides in every living being. "Soul" is complete means "self sufficient" like "Supreme Soul"<br>  <br>  In other words the "Soul"<br>  which resides in our body is Identical with the "Supreme Soul"<br>   <br>  "Purnat" = from (that) complete referring to "Supreme Soul"<br>  "Purnam" = (this) complete referring to "Individual Soul" <br>  "Udachyate" = has "come out" or emerged<br>  <br>  This means from the "Supreme Soul" (which is complete by itself) this "Individual Soul" (Complete) has emerged. <br>  <br>  This is the verbal meaning of the above. Now let us try to understand the same.<br>  <br>  The Ocean is full of water.Thus referring to ocean we can say that(the ocean) is complete (Purnam)= full here.<br>  <br>  From this, the small vessel is filled with water.Thus referring to the vessel also we can say this is Complete (Purnam) = full here.<br>  <br>  Thus, we can say that the ocean is complete (full of water) and the vessel is also complete (i.e.full of water). <br>  <br>  Thus, "Purnamadah Purnamidam" can be interpreted as Supreme Soul and the Individual Soul are both Complete i.e. whole and Identical.<br>  <br>  Purnat Purnam Udachyate meaning<br>  from the Supreme Soul this Individual Soul is emerged.<br>  <br>  Purnasya = of Complete referring to "Supreme Soul"<br>  <br>  Purnam =Complete referring to "Individual Soul"<br>  <br>  Aday =giving away to<br>  (i.e. by giving away the completeness (wholeness)of "Supreme Soul" to "Individul Soul"<br>  <br>  Purnam eva vashishyate only the Complete remains.<br>  <br>  Now because a few vessels of water, if taken away from the Ocean, is the Ocean incomplete i.e has it become less full of water? or is it still full of water? It hardly matters to the Ocean(i.e.,the level of water in Ocean) as to how much water is taken away. <br>  <br>  Similarly from "Supreme self" individual self has emerged and is identical and even after taking away the soul, what remains is also the complete self.<br>  <br>  3) Explanation of  meaning with example:<br>  <br>  Thus as per this Shanti Mantra, the Atma(soul) which is there within ourselves is part of Brahman(God) because it has emerged from God.<br>  <br>  Just as the mercury droplet when disturbed give us small small droplets and when we bring them together, again merge into the big droplet. Thus our souls have also emerged from God and are destined to merge in God. Only difference is mercury droplet has definite quantity hence reduces in size when small droplets are formed. But Brahman being infinite being does not get reduced even after the soul is emerged. And even after the soul merges in to Brahman it remains the same.<br>  <br>  But this is the ideal condition. Just as mercury droplets covered with dust do not merge fully into a big droplet, our souls covered with subtle cover of desires (to worldly things) do not merge with God after death but are born again and again.The aim of study of Upanishad is to cast off the dust of desire and let our souls merge with the God.|`|yeImLi0Waa	Friend !

This knowledge is emanated from God and is originated in the heart of four rishis as stated above. God is Almighty i.e., He has all powers. So He needs no assistance to do universal deeds. In human body alive soul resides. And soul is dependent, soul requires mouth to speak, eye to see, hand to write etc., etc. but not God. So from His power God originates the knowledge of Vedas in the rishis without writing, or speaking etc. <br>  <br>  Was Veda originally one book and then divided into four parts later? Is it true? Why? When?<br>  Swami Ramswarup: Knowledge of the Vedas is one but it was given to four rishis in the shape of Rigveda, Yajurveda,Saamveda and Atharvaveda. these Vedas have three topics stated above.<br>  <br>  What surprised me was, that the I CHING belongs to it, which I've been practicing for over 30 yrs.

(Bertrand Russell said that if there turned out to be a god and a heaven when he died, his defense to God for having been an atheist would be "Insufficient evidence!”)<br>  <br>  But if you look a little deeper you realize how intellectually lazy and/or dishonest the atheist’s arguments are. The atheist position is possible only if I ignore the fact that science doesn't offer the slightest clue as to what was going on before Planck time. We can explain (or think we can explain) everything back to 10 to the minus 43 seconds before the Big Bang, but of course the "money moment" is precisely the moment immediately prior to that!<br>  <br>  So the atheist view is possible only if I ignore this very big elephant in the room.<br>  <br>  This leaves me with a quandary. I must look elsewhere to find out how the universe got here in the first place, and to explain why there is evil in the world, why music or a scene in a movie can bring me to tears, or why gravity should work in the first place. (Even Steven Hawking says that "based on what we as scientists know, there should be nothing.")<br>  <br>  If I want life to have any meaning (i.e., be anything more than just the sum total of my pleasure and pain), I have to ask myself what body of thought and imagery best explains the existence of joy and suffering, why men and women are the way they are, my desire for meaning in the first place, and yes what really does hold the planets in place. In science the best theory is the one that explains the most data the most completely, and in my opinion, the Bible does that better than the Upanishads, Greek mythology, existentialism or any other body of thought and imagery. You might have a different opinion, but if you claim to be an earnest, honest intelligent person, you have to have an opinion on the matter. (Consider the possibility that the Bible doesn't tell us anything about science and technology precisely because we can figure that stuff out by ourselves.)<br>  <br>  Regarding the stars and the planets, saying "gravity holds them in place!" is like my father saying "trick photography!" when I as a 6-year-old asked him how they did some mysterious thing I saw on TV. It really doesn't tell you anything substantive. It just replaces one mystery with another.<br>  <br>  There's no doubt that the claims of Christianity are completely preposterous.  The only thing more preposterous is the notion that the earth and everything in it including my eyes, brain and emotions were all an accident.<br>  <br>  This is my intellectual response to the atheist. My emotional response is "Okay, you win. There's no god. Gee, I feel so much better now!"|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	Jews do not believe in Hell!  Here is a description of the Jewish idea of the afterlife:<br>  <br>  When a person dies and goes to heaven, the judgment is not arbitrary and externally imposed. Rather, the soul is shown two videotapes. The first video is called "This is Your Life!" Every decision and every thought, all the good deeds, and the embarrassing things a person did in private is all replayed without any embellishments. It's fully bared for all to see. That's why the next world is called Olam HaEmet - "the World of Truth," because<br>  there we clearly recognize our personal strengths and shortcomings, and the true purpose of life. In short, Hell is not the Devil with a pitchfork stoking the fires.<br>  <br>  The second video depicts how a person's life "could have been..." if the right choices had been made, if the opportunities were seized, if the potential was actualized. This video - the pain of squandered potential - is much more difficult to bear. But at the same time it purifies the soul as well. The pain creates regret which removes the barriers and enables the soul to completely connect to G-d.<br>  <br>  Not all souls merit Gehenom. It is for people who have done good but need to be purified. A handful of people are too evil for Gehenom, and they are punished eternally. Pharaoh is one example.<br>  <br>  So will you please leave us out of these discussions you obsessively have about atheists?  You know nothing about Judaism and you are an arrogant son-of-a-*****.|`|AA11297267	Show me a resurrected person, and I'll consider it.<br>  Show me hell, and I'll consider it.<br>  <br>  Just because a book of collected myths says something doesn't mean it's true.

And aside from that one mention of a circle, there are a dozen or so other places where it talks about the "four corners" or the "ends" of the earth -- a sphere has no corners and no ends, so how do you explain those?<br>  <br>  Duh.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Since atheists, by definition, lack the belief in any god(s), the stories attributed to them would also fall under that lack of belief.<br>  Since hell is a construct of religion, it requires the acceptance of a deity.<br>  <br>  Therefore, hell is not a believable concept to atheists.<br>  <br>  Also, large numbers of believers do not automatically make things true.<br>  <br>  EDIT: The bible also states that if a tree was large enough it could be seen from all four CORNERS of the earth.<br>  For the sake of argument, let's stipulate that this doesn't mean the earth is square (which it does) but refers to North, South, East, and West (as may believers claim)<br>  For a tree to be seen from anywhere on earth, the earth could not be round.|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	Sure.<br>  Why not?<br>  Look in the real world.<br>  Decode this lyrics " Knowing me knowing you"<br>  With living examples too in time.<br>  After shaking and waking up in resurecting the dead Mummy of failures and horrors of the past from the twilight zone in different time zone in time too.<br>  Even with Lucifer the great Satan alive himself in "All Blacks" also being resurrected too in time.<br>  With "Alley Oop" living in misery as "The Chain gang " in idol worshipping the dead Mummy in kicking the butts of God in not worshipping God but idol worshipping past dirty old man like you and me with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ back in the past like themselves in time.<br>  Getting themselves kick on the butts by the dead from the twilight zone while they were the Living in different time zone in time.<br>  What a bunch of educated idiots with self lack of knowledge and total loss of IQ getting their head mess up and rough up by the dead Mummy against the wall in nailing them all back into the coffin alive by the dead in time.<br>  Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49<br>  What do you think?|`|2N3v5iSYaa	Should we compare the many other religions too?

Why that long?<br>  <br>  The record shows that Noah began to father sons after reaching 500 years of age (2470?B.C.E.), the Deluge occurring in his 600th year. (Ge 5:32; 7:6) Already married at the time of the Deluge (Ge 6:18), Shem is stated to have fathered his first son, Arpachshad, two years after the Deluge (2368?B.C.E.) when he, Shem, was 100 years old. (Ge 11:10) This would mean that Shem was born when Noah was 502 years of age (2468?B.C.E.); and since Ham appears to be referred to as the “youngest son” (Ge 9:24), Japheth would logically be the first son born to Noah, when he was 500 years of age.<br>  <br>  Noah would need the assistance of sons to build the Ark and gather the stock and animals that God had decreed. <br>  <br>  As you said, the sons of Noah had long lives too. Shem lived to 600 years old. (Ge 11:10,?11) His death thus occurred some 13 years after the death of Sarah (1881?B.C.E.) and ten years after the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah (1878?B.C.E.).<br>  <br>  It is interesting how quickly the life span declined after the flood. It may have been an environment change. Abraham was the 10th generation from Shem and he lived 175 years.<br>  <br>  By the time of Moses writing the 90th Psalm, just 3 centuries from Shem's death, the average age had dropped to 70 to 80 years.<br>  <br>  10?In themselves the days of our years are seventy years;<br>  And if because of special mightiness they are eighty years,<br>  Yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things;<br>  For it must quickly pass by, and away we fly.<br>  <br>  So, for the most part, some humans have survived longer, but not many and not often.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Most numbers in the Bible are symbolic. 120 could just mean 'a long time'.<br>  <br>  Even today, there are very few people who can prove they are over 120. There have been claims, but often they were people who had no birth certificates. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying God is 'imposing' a certain time span for lives, but the human body, even with modern medicine is not too likely to go much past 120. <br>  <br>  Other places in the Bible something is said about 70 years. Many, many people today live past "Fourscore and 10" or whatever it is.|`|XwuZYLg1aa	I keep looking at this and wondering if we are misapplying the 120 years.  Yes after the flood life spans begin to shorten, but some are longer and some shorter that 120 years.  Could the 120 years be the time from when God made that statement until the flood and thus God's SPirit strove with man in that day for another 120 years until the coming of the great deluge?|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	Moses recorded genesis 6:18 at the the Same time Human government was also established;<br>  <br>  Moses also recorded Psalm 90:<br>  The Yrs of Man 70 maybe 80 yrs but pain and sorrow:<br>  Should You live a full 70 Yrs ,I mean Live in the Fullest sense of that Word--Thank God for that Blessing ,because a Great number of People do not make it to seventy;|`|OCWFGHrHaa	because|`|FRNgFcuhaa	Only God decides as to how long any one of us will live in this world of His before he/she is summoned to meet Him after death. Noah, pbuh, by most accounts lived to the age of 950 years. And many other prophets after Noah experience life spans of very much more than 150 years. <br>  <br>  This is not surprising really, as God's will permeates all His creations, including us human beings, with His very own rules governing all His creations. God's Will simply cannot be likened to any sort of an inconsistency or governed by any other rule but His. His commands and will are beyond human understanding or contemplation. If He so wish that modern humans should not live longer than 100 years so be it, by His command! By nature and by His will, Man is powerless to break any of God's rules. Of course there are exceptions to His rules, from time to time, only so if He so wish!
Z03nSGhEaa	There's never been denominational primacy per say. Jesus pointed that out. Yet there are advantages in covenants & doctrines of truth (Such as the New Covenant & the Apostles doctrines).<br>  He taught us to seek his truth & yet some denominations refuse to grow in their understanding, which is a clear disadvantage, some even go so far as to persecute & reject those who choose otherwise.<br>  So, generally to say, God can't save someone unless they're part of a particular denomination is clearly false.<br>  But to say there's no value in the truth of God is also clearly false.<br>  Beyond that there are what Paul calls doubtful disputations, which bring the whole subject together. (referred to in all of Rom 14)<br>  <br>  Rom 14:1<br>  Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.<br>  <br>  Can be a tough subject yet of great importance if we want to develop the character of Christ.<br>  Peace.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	It brings it totally down to a true individual level of spiritual relationship with the Father, totally negating institutional focus such as denominational-ism and leaves the institution or place of worship as no more than a place of assembling together. "Where two or more are gathered together in My Name, I am in their midst"! <br>  also "Forsake not the assembling together of the believers".<br>  <br>  It will look this way in the eventuality when we are with Him, and many will be ashamed, some embarrassed and some apologizing to one another.<br>  <br>  There won't be a First Baptist corner or an Assemble of God section or a Four Square room.<br>  <br>  It's still my hope though that each one of these still that shares worship in spirit and truth succeeds and prospers.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Yes, but his Christian followers reinstated it shortly after he died.

The purpose of the Jews mission was to teach people the truth of God's will and this was done in demonstration. The response of Jesus was more important than to whom He was speaking to. Men were created spirits and were to exist as spirits who conveyed God's will and truth at all time. This is a true form of worship. The fact that He went to a woman was to tell us that ALL are included and should know truth since the first woman was deceived and did know know the truth. Jesus, personally, told her, so no one ever be deceived again.|`|mNyhRGowaa	YES HE DID YAHSHUA IS LORD!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	He did not abolish Truth!  (Jesus IS The Truth!)

And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<br>  24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br>  25Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<br>  26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.<br>  27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<br>  28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. <br>  <br>  I don't think Jesus JUST abolish denominational primacy of the Jews...<br>  <br>  <br>  =)|`|AA10641825	He abolished primate primacy, when he told his followers "Except ye eat my flesh."<br>  He was telling them they are maggots, but they didn't get it.<br>  .|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	Well I know Jesus didn't come to establish a denomination.The thing that changed through Him was the way God is worshiped.There is no middle man like a priest or rabbi.You go to Him through the Spirit that came and took up it's abode in you when you got saved,born again.He is no respecter of persons we are all equal in His sight so we go for our selves.So when you worship in Spirit and Truth you are worshiping Him that way because He is in you.You talk to Him one on one.So in essence The Spirit is God dwelling in you.<br>  The reason they worshiped in that mountain was it was where God came to visit and His dwelling place where Moses received the ten commandments.Where the Burning Bush was that God spoke to Moses from.

Sex, boobs, ***, are just extras, just to fulfill the enjoyment. they use cheesy pick-up lines just to get girls; if they don't use them, how would they get the girl? For an example, if the guy asks you out in a cold way, you will most likely to say no right? My boyfriend is basically asshole on the outside towards other people where he can defend himself and me, but sweet, romantic, sensitive inside and that's what i adore. Guys can be sensitive at times if you catch the right moment. They don't like to be sensitive since they would look weak and no one would give them attention.|`|kLPOFIOpaa	Because they want sex.

zvifDjJQaa	I agree with everyone telling you to be honest. Explain that you are not prepared for this step in life and don't feel right participating without you whole heart in it. <br>  <br>  The desired response would be loving understanding. They will probably want to continue on helping you understand so that you can make an educated decision. <br>  <br>  Please don't fall victim to the thinking of "darwin" (answered above). Religion is a very intellectual subject. It requires more thoughtfulness and intellect than any other intelligible idea. The major issue is faith. Darwin has faith in science which is nothing more than chance and chaos; Christians have faith in God who is perfect, just, loving and has all power.  <br>  <br>  Continue your search for truth. Find the answers that have peace in your soul. Don't go forward with the motions; make sure you do what you do with your whole heart.<br>  <br>  1 Chronicles 28:9<br>  "And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts.

Be honest.  Only focus on Carney at this point tho. Let the Pastor know that you will set another date at another time for confirmation. I would not tell the Pastor at this time about your doubts on finishing the confirmation, just focus on going to Carney. The reason for this not talking about your confirmation is ...why state something that might hurt someone when you are not for sure yet how you feel? This will give you time to re consider if this is what you want or not. Then if you are still 100% sure that you are not comfortable with the Church and working with your studies..then talk to the Pastor.

7GWENFgIaa	Assuming you're going to self-study, you'll need a dictionary, a primer book, a textbook, and Internet access.<br>  <br>  "Harper Collins Concise Latin Dictionary" is a good choice for a dictionary, but, of course, there are other good ones out there. The best electronic dictionary I've seen is "Whittaker's Words":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://archives.nd.edu/words.html" rel="nofollow">http://archives.nd.edu/words.html</a>  (online version)<br>  <a href="http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.ht...</a>  (downloadable program)<br>  <br>  <br>  A primer, or introductory, book is very helpful in the beginning when you need to just pick up the basics. Formal textbooks tend to be very "technical" and often rely on a teacher for consultation. Primers are lighter in content and are written with self-studiers in mind. I prefer "The Everything Learning Latin Book". I like the author's tone and how he understanding where many of the difficulties lie. "Latin for Dummies" is another option.<br>  <br>  Next, you'll need a real textbook which goes through the grammar in some detail. I suggest "Wheelock's Latin", simply because there are a lot of resources available both in print and on the Internet. Although it's geared mainly for college students, if you're as motivated as you seem, you'll have little difficulty. Many sites (including the ones below) have study groups and forums dedicated to this textbook.<br>  <br>  Here are two sites that you should check out. They both have resources like online textbooks and exercise worksheets which you can download for free. They also offer study groups which are great for reviewing and comparing your answers with other students at the same level. Make sure you also check out the "Textkit Forum", where you can "converse" with others, instead of just asking a question (as in Y!A). There are more out there, but I personally haven't gone anywhere else.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.textkit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.textkit.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.quasillum.com/study/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.quasillum.com/study/index.php</a><br>  <br>  Of course, you could always post questions here in Y!A.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, you'll need time and perseverance. Learning Latin is very difficult, so you should take your time and make sure you really understand a concept before moving to the next. It's also an accumulative process, with each concept building on preceding ones - and some can get really hairy. If you rush through, you'll never learn it well enough to use it properly.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I have no resources on Hebrew, but I'd advise you to learn them one at a time. Unlike Romance languages like French, Spanish, Italian etc. which share many common root words and grammatical similarities among themselves and English, both Latin and Hebrew are too complex and foreign to learn at the same time. I would suggest Latin first, since English is much closer to it than to Hebrew and, hence, more familiar.|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	May I ask why? For the sheer pleasure or challenge of it, sure why not, but learning a language is such an arduous task, that I think it much wiser to learn an actual language rather than a dead one.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You might not have liked my answer, but I gave you my honest advice. And yes, Latin is indeed a dead language. It's modern manifestations can be seen in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and countless other dialects, but Latin, per se, is dead.<br>  <br>  HEY!!!

I had always been a fussy eater, and my mum said I was slightly underweight before I became a child.<br>  <br>  'Why do you think you started to put on weight.'<br>  I've never really got to the bottom of it, but I think it's a combonation of being upset about my parent's divorce and comfort eating and suddenly becoming aware of all the new foods around me that my parents would restrict in the house.<br>  <br>  'What do you eat in the average day?'<br>  Normal breakfast of a slice of toast w. butter and jam, glass of OJ. Lunch is usually a sandwich and drink, sometimes chips. Now the worst part of the day is after school, where I tend to eat chips, crisps, chococlate, and in excess. So if I buy choclate, it's not normally one bar, it's like three or four bars. At dinner I often have second helpings.<br>  <br>  'Are you unhappy about your weight?'<br>  There are times where I would deffo like to be skinnier, but I feel miserable when I diet. In my life, if I want something so much I usually get it. The fact that I haven't been able to lose weight just shows that perhaps I don't really want to. It's like a protection thing. It's hard to understand when you've never had a weight problem.<br>  <br>  'What diets have you undertaken?'<br>  I found I was more succsesful when I did diets that had a strong sense of structure. It wouldn't really be good enough to have a couple of standards, it was better with solid rules. Weight watchers helped me lose a stone here and there.<br>  <br>  'Do you feel jealous of people who can wear nice clothes.'<br>  I can wear nice clothes too! It's just about jazzing things up with jewellery and accesories. After all, earrings don't come in dress sizes do they? These days, clothes shops make nice clothing for very large sizes. This is good in on way but then it's bad at the same time, because fat people can't get encouraged to lose weight.<br>  <br>  'Have you ever been bullied?'<br>  There was a bit of teasing at primary school, but I would always find a little insult to throw back, and besides I was always quite tall so I think I scared them a bit. In secondary school, I haven't had any problems. So many kids are fat that it's not really as if you can stand ou that much any more!<br>  <br>  'What health problems do you experience?'<br>  I'm lucky with my health, but occasionaly I get back and foot pains. I have to be careful because both cancer and diabetes run in my family. Some obese people experience infertility.<br>  'How do you feel about the obesity epidemic in western society'<br>  I think it's a very sad thing that should be happening in richer countries when so many children in third-world countries are dying of starvation. It's ironic though, isn't it, that I should be saying this. I think the government are taking intelligent steps towards promoting health amongst young obese people.<br>  <br>  'What would you say to somebody who just calls you greedy and selfish?<br>  I would partly agree. I have no underlying health causes to my weight problem, I just eat too damn much! But some of the emotions in involved in putting on, and having that much weight on you are complex, and difficult to be understood by a person of normal build. I would say that whilst I have little will power in trying to get rid of the weight, it's hard to know what it is like on the inside.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, whatever it's for.|`|Eq3PNh3baa	Hmmm...I guess you could ask them how they got obese? What it's like living as an obese person? What kind of attention they get from the public? And if they are ever going to take any actions to become healthy. Hope this helps!
6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	The law requires "reasonable accommodation" from business regarding wheelchair access, and telling him he cannot be there could be perceived as discrimination, but you have a valid argument that there is no way to accommodate him, especially if his visit isn't entirely as a customer.  If you want, you can play equal victim.  Tell him you enjoy his visits, but the manager or owner received a complaint from a customer about not being able to come in, that too much space was being taken and you were only chatting.  Something to that effect.  Tell him that you all were asked not to be socializing with people unless they were paying customers.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Yikes this is a hard one! I had a very simular situation like this before when i worked at a small resteraunt and this lady would come in EVERYDAY! I think she was just bored! She was an older lady and she would bring in HUGE bags of news papers and stuff. I think she lived in the homeless shelter down town and walked to us everyday just so she had something to do. Anyways not only did she keep the employee's from doing their job cause she was talking she also would talk to the customers as they walked in and some of them were a little uncomfortable with her. She was such a sweet lady and none of us knew what to do so our manager just put some no soliciting signs up in the front door she notised them right away and when she came in that day she asked about them i told her nobody was aloud to stand around anymore unless they are eating or buying something then they have to move on. we told her we had no idea why he made that rule but they did she kinda got the hint and said "so my visit will be cut short now?" i had to tell her yes but i guess it was the nicest way we could do anything. she still comes in every now and then but only for a few miniutes. maybe you guys can do something like that? put up a sign?|`|abx5VNsOaa	Don't pity this man just because he is in a wheelchair,i sound blunt but if he was able bodied you'd have no problem telling him i dare say.<br>  See the person ,not the disability.<br>  Just my opinion.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Explain about the lack of room and suggest that maybe he "sit" in the back or limit his time.

Eventually, you may be able to joke with him and say something like" OK, George, this seating has to move out so the next group can come in! See you soon!" But, please, don't hurt his feelings.

I would tell him that you enjoy his company but, at the same time you need to turn over the tables as you are running a business and have expenses.  If you can not pay the rent what is he going to do for you?  If paying customers can not get a table then they don't come into your store.  I would tell him that he can not stay there for hours at a time.  You need to turn over the tables and you are putting a time limit for all. <br>  <br>  Sorry to say not matter what you tell him he is not going to like it.  He will use the wheel chair as an excuse.  You need to decide what's more important "being mean" or going out of business?
