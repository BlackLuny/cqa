I mean cant we just focus on our pressurised heavy water reactor program and fast breedor reactor program and utilize our immense reserves of thorium, though it will take time which scientists put at about 10 years. We have lived for 59 years without foreign support and developed our own nuclear program so 10 more years shouldn't hurt. Scientists community response will be highly appreciated. Thanks.
