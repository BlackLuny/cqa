20090129083338AAOqoi7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Multiple Ear Infections in 9 month old...?	My daughter is 9 months old on Sat and currently has her second ear infection (double ear infection).  My question is this, she also had an ear infection 3 months ago, but in only one ear.  I meant to ask the Dr this today and intend to ask next week at her follow up, but until then... With this being her second ear infection already, is this a sign that she will continue to have this problem through out her early years?  Am I am looking at chronic ear infections, or is this normal to have 2 ear infections this young?
20090129083425AAE8tKD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Self feeding and soilds?	my daughter is 7 months and we have been giving her graduates puffs and yogart melts and biter cookies. She understands they go in her mouth and she chews them because when i put them in her mouth she eats them up like no ones business but we dont give her biter cookies every night because she gets real messy and she only gets them on nights she has a bath. But we give her a mix of yogart melts and puffs. But i put some down on her high chair and she tries to grab them but with her plam not her pointer and thumb and she tries to get them in her mouth but they really dont get in there she just kinda licks them off her palms. She has been doing this for a month now. Also she has mastered all 2nds and i know 3rds are chunckyer and i wasnt sure what age u start 3rds at. She has been on 2nds for 2 months now and takes great big bites and some nights we dont even need the bib cause it all gets in. All 4 of her front teeth are half way in, she got them all at the same time. Im just not sure when its right to move her foods or what since she only has 4 teeth.

Please do not give me the speach about waiting until 4 months unless you tried it and something bad happened!!!

20090129083557AATCtaz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Miscarriage..Pregnant again..2 possible father??!!! Or 1??? HELP?	Ok ladies please dont freak out on me...I am 21 weeks preg and happy and loving my little kicks. BUT**** I think I had a misscarriage right before I got pregnant. I never got to the doctors because I never had cramps and just thought it was my body cleaning its self out. Anywho..I was smoking, drinking and on birth control. Always at the club, partying...ect. And well I had a normal period..it came every 28 days due to my pill. And lasted about 4 days..My lmp was on August 28th So I started a new pack on the Sunday which was the 31st...took the pill on that Monday, and Tuesday as normal. And well that Wenesday I started bleeding super heavy..I mean a pad change every hour..if not more! So I stopped taking my pill, figuring it was the cause. It lasted about 4 days..super heavy all the way through. But no cramps what so ever. i felt great despite the bleeding. So I never went to the doctors. And well I had sex with a guy on September 7th, right when I stopped bleeding (i know very stupid) But we didnt finish..like just stopped because I realized it was not right. And who knew that on the September 11th my x would come back in my life. I promise it wasnt expected. And well we had sex. September 11th 14th, 15th, 17th 21st and thats it. And well on October 6th I took a pregnancy test because I was just thinking im having sex, and still not back on the pill. It came out negative..and I took one again on the 7th and 8th both negative, well I had one last in the box so I tookit on the 9th and it came up positive. So based on my lmp I got pregnant on the 11th..and based on my due date which is June 14th 2009 I got preg on the 17th...ok so its like I did have all that bleeding, so could it throw it off. Now I was like 5 weeks when I got my first ultrasound..and 7 weeks when I got my second..and like 10 weeks when I got my 3rd...all measuring at June 14th. And if thats the case it says my lmp should have been on September 7th. Which I know it was not.     And yes I am keeping my baby, and yes I plan on being much more responsibleand yes im most deff going to do a DNA test. So please dont judge me. I have learned my lesson. Im just asking so I can prepare myself sorta..    THANKS    So did I maybe misscarriage, and also who is my childs father?
20090129083532AAdO1lB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Has anyone had someone else raise their children?	My fiance put his daughter in his parents' care.  Long story short he knows it's best for her.      We picked her up early this morning to take her and get her opinion on some things.  When we dropped her off she rushed to her grandmother and hugged her.      You can see the heartbreak on his face but he knows it's best.  But is there any other encouragement for him, other than that she's in the best possible place?
20090129083631AAoZleL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Getting the Clearblue Fertility Monitor used or new?	My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for 2 years now.  Recently I've heard a LOT of good things about this fertility monitor!  Someone I know was trying for a year and a half, and then got this monitor and was pregnant in 2 months.      My husband and I are going to try it, and were looking into getting one used -- people sell them everywhere.  I'm finding them used for about $60, and new they are $200.  On Clearblue's website, however, it says to only buy new for 2 reasons.      1.  It gets used to your individual cycle and if someone else uses it, it will take months to adjust to yours, therefore taking longer to work.      2.  Sticks that you urinate on are inserted into the machine, thus possibly containing bacteria which you may not be able to get "100% clean."      Do you think this is just a marketing issue because they want to sell more of the fertility monitors, or do you think it's true and I should totally only consider buying it new?      Has anyone purchased it used and had it work for them quickly?      Do you recommend new or used?      Thanks!

20090129084031AAvJovw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	If you are a father who lives hours away from your child, how often do you see him?	My son is 4 years old and his father and I just split up in May 2008. We both moved to different cities. He moved to a city 5 hours from his son and I. Seven months later he is engaged. The problem is, he has only seen his son three times in 7 months. Our son is so young but he is taking it really hard because he doesn't understand. He went having his dad around 24/7 when he wasn't in school to seeing him once every couple of months. His dad will say he's coming and then back out the day before he's supposed to come. He said money is an issue (even though he makes three times more money than I do and doesn't financially support his child) so I offered to pay for his trip. He said okay then today (the day before he's scheduled to come) he backs out. He just keeps saying he can't come. No other explanation. My son cries for him and when he talks to him on the phone he asks him to come see him and his father tells him he's coming so he goes to the door and looks for him. My son is in special education at school because his progress has reverted since the move. I really see that my son needs his father but his father is not doing everything he can do to be a part of his life. If you're a father who lives far away from your child, how often do you see your child? How do you keep a good relationship with your child? How do you be there for your child?      Anyone with any other insight will help.

20090129084154AARvO4l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What games do you play with your kids that you made up?	When my son was  between 4 - 5 he loved watching the cartoon Pokemon.  He loved pancakes and one morning I invented a breakfast game to keep him entertained while I was cooking.  We called it Pokemon pancakes.  If you have ever seen the cartoon, during the halfway mark they show a silhouette of a Pokemon for the kids to guess.  So we started doing that.  I would drizzle the pancake batter into the pan in a crazy shape and ask him to guess which Pokemon he was going to eat for breakfast.  He always guessed right! (Because I didn't really aim for anything specific and just praised whichever answer he gave.)  He loved it and it helped to build his confidence.      What games have you invented to stimulate and grow your children?

So i've had 4 tablets today and i won't be taking anymore today. I've been using them since yesterday and only took once dose yesterday.       How many are you allowed to take per day? Don't say phone your doctor or midwife because my midwife is on holiday until Sunday so i won't be able to speak to her till Monday which it'll probably be away by then. My doctor won't speak to me about pregnancy related issues because he always says my midwife will know best.       So please can someone give me opinions on what your doc said.      I might only need to use them tomorrow aswell, so that would be using them for 3 days in a row, but not every 4 hours, just once or twice a day. Do you think this is bad or fine?

It hit him all of a sudden because usually before he gets sick which isn't often he gets fussy a day or two before and he didn't this time. He has had a fever since monday everyday. The highest it has got is 103.5 and we've been giving him childrens tylenol to bring it down. He has a runny, stuffy nose, congestion, and just all around lethargic. He's not himself. I'm used to him running and playing constantly. He's never been sick this long before. He usually gets over it in like 2 days. However my mother just got over the flu and she keeps him for me during the day while I work. I brought him to our family doctor tuesday and he never said what he had, he just prescribed him some amoxillin. Does anyone know why it's taking him so long to get over and what he could possible have?

20090129084506AASqXYB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	25 weeks and still still worried about my sleeping positions?	I am 25 weeks and two days, and I am still finding myself having to sleep on my back sometimes ( when I can get to sleep). Now, I sleep with a plethora of pillows around me and two under my head so I am slightly elevated and sometimes I will put a little throw pillow or teddy bear under my back as well... But I am worried I may be hurting the baby.       I know that when your body thinks that it needs to be adjusted it will do so.. I have had him kicking me or my heart racing before when I lie on my back and therefore I would move.. but sometimes it is just really comfortable for me to sleep on my back, and nothing happens. He doesn't kick like crazy and I don't get the heart palpitations, so i end up laying like that for a while until I realize consciously that I should turn on my side.       What is your opinion? I haven't asked my doctor yet, but I do have an appt. next week.
20090129085750AASm2gd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Does anyone else agree that the best thing you can give a baby is...?	a father?  I know I'm going to get a lot of negative comments from this one, but please try to view the issue from this perspective for a moment.  I am not out to judge people, but I am absolutely frustrated with the irresponsible behavior of young females, and who is suffering?  The children who grow up with no daddys!  We as women can choose who and how we have babies.  Birth control is commonly available, and we can choose to use it.  We can choose what kind of man we have sex with, when we have sex, and if we want to commit or wait for a committment (marriage?) before having sex.  By having unprotected sex, and then blaming the uncommitted man for leaving, it is taking no responsibility for bringing a child into the world who will possibly never have an involved daddy.  This is becoming too common.  Women need to wake up and take responsibility.  What a blessing to give your future children, by saving yourself and waiting to have unprotected sex with your husband and planning a baby.  Of course the man should take responsibility as well and help the mother raise the baby, but he is not the only one to blame.  And I know that people make mistakes, but I am worried that this is becoming so common in our society.  It creates a domino effect.  I also know that beautiful things can come out of bad situations, and I pray in each case that happens.  Alright, I'm ready for all of the comments saying I am judging, but I'm actually trying to help people to realize what a gift you give your children when you have children with a committed and loving man.

I have tried absolutely everything, I mean everything. I am getting very discouraged. She is very, very smart and advanced in every other way besides using the potty. I am looking for a little encouragement, got any for me? Is there anyone else out there with the same problem?

20090129085741AAlufIk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 18 month old has started waking at night??.. ?	Hi,     Our 18 month old has started waking several times in the night. It usually starts after 11:30/12 and happens one or two more times. Im exhausted. He didnt have a good sleep pattern until after 12 months and it nearly wiped my husband out. I cant remember exactly what we had done to help before, maybe his cycle just changed, Im not sure. We only offer him water and some verbal comfort. I was so tired and frustrated the other night I cried out and pleaded with him to just go back to sleep. He goes to sleep anywhere between 7:30 and 8:30 and wakes in the morning at 7:30, up and ready for the day. He always has a nap at 10:30 and some days another one around 3 or 4.       My husband and I are at a loss for what to do. His crying sounds so, scary, sometimes, like he has hurt himself in his crib but a lot of occasions he is still laying there cuddled in his blankets but sobbing heavily. It takes him a few minutes to realize that I have come into the room  in which case he either holds his head up or completely sits up.       What do we do? Are we putting him to sleep to late? Too early? We have been trying to do a regular pattern.. eat, bath, bed but some nights he isnt ready for bed and just throws a tantrum in his crib.       My husband and I are completely on edge and frustrated with the situation. I am a stay at home mom and the past few days I have woken so cranky that it makes for a bad day for the baby and I . What to do??? Any advice helps, thanks!!!

20090129093347AAWN2T7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do you get your baby to self-soothe?	Hi, I'm looking for some tips on getting my soon-to-be-born baby to eventually self-soothe (at the right age).       About me:      I'm due to give birth in 3 weeks with my 2nd baby, and my first is almost 11 1/2 months. Zachary, my 1st, is a very "needy" baby, he constantly wants attention and to be played with. He rarely plays by himself for more than a few minutes. I think it's because from the beginning I never let him cry for more than 2 minutes before picking him up. So as he grew, he learned to always be picked up and he never self-soothes, except with his bottle. Which is bad because he always wants it at night and will only fall asleep with a bottle of formula. We are trying to kick this habit but are finding it almost impossible.       So you can probably guess why, for the newborn, I'm open to doing things a little differently. Nothing drastic like always using CIO, but maybe help me out with some tips based on other moms' experiences?       Please just answer my question if you want to help me, I'm not looking for judgments on my parenting.      Thanks:)

20090129094219AAplhpn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Would you be offended because I am? Am I justified?	I have a seven month old daughter, and for about three months now, she has been on the target brand formula, and never had a problem with it. I wouldnt have switched it, if it would cause probles for my daughter, I asked a couple questions here about it, and did my own research myself on it before switching.   My daughters father (we are not together and lives about 4 hours from were we live) tells me that the target brand is not a safe brand, that I dont know what could be in it. That his mother doesn't feel comfortable with her being on that formula, and will be better if I went back to the brand name, and she is willing to pay for it, month by month.    This offends me, first the fathers mother shouldn't be paying for it, the father should, and second, they think I would rather save money for my daughters health? Would you be offended?

20090129090720AAnVuab	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do if you were me?	I have a 5 year old daughter that has been sick since Sunday.  On Sunday she had a horrible headache and a temp of 102.7, took her to the ER was told it was strep, he looked under her armpit and said, yep its strep gave us an antibiotic and sent us on our way, I didn't really believe him since her throat wasn't hurting.  Monday morning her fever got to 103.7, called her dr they said its normal for strep to spike a fever. Tuesday she complained of a headache and had a low grade fever nothing major.  Yesterday, her head was hurting her so bad that she could barely walk, and again low grade fever (never got over 100.5). I took her to the dr and he told me that he really didn't know what was going on, but she should be better by Friday.  Well on and off last night she was waking up crying because of her head, and this morning she is laid out on the couch still complaining of her head hurting, I still have to help her to the bathroom because of the pain.  Her temp is normal (99.7).  My question is, what would you do, would you take her back to the doctor and demand more tests or skip the doctor and go to the ER and demand a CT scan?  I don't want her to have to go thru test after test, but she's not getting better.  And to me 5 year olds can't fake a headache or paleness.  Any advice would be great, thank you

Have you noticed this?      Is this how flabby my tummy will be after i have the baby??      i used to not be able to pinch any fat, and now, i can grab it everywhere...does this mean he's moving further and further down into position??
20090129091441AATgsYZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do I pay her?  How much?	A good friend of mine who watched Emma for me during the day for the first five months of her life (I was finishing college) and babysat her for me if I went to substitute teach sometimes has been keeping her while I've been in the hospital for almost two weeks (except about 3 days while my parent's kept Emma).  I used to pay her $15/day when she babysat.  I owe her some money anyways for a box of diapers and probably a little for snacks.  I can't afford to pay her very much as my hubby hasn't been working b/c he has been with me (they let him take time off but without pay).  But I'd like to pay her something on top of the diapers.  What do you think is appropriate?  Just to note Emma is VERY good.  Takes two good naps during the day and is in bed by 6:30 everynight.  Not to mention my friend can't have anymore children and LOVES taking care of her.  So anyways what would you do?

20090129090431AA21cb2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Do you think I was ovulating?	The first day of my cycle was on 01/15/2009. All ovulation calculators stated that I would ovulate on 01/28. On 01/27 my cervix mucus was very stretchy, cloudy white with a slight pink color to to it.  Also was a lot of mucus at once. I also had taken my ovulation test and on the 27th and the line was very light which states that I might not have the LH surge. Either way we had sex on the 27th and 28th and plan to have sex again on the 29th. I never noticed any very liquid egg white mucus would that be because we had intercourse on the 27th. Sort of a lot of questions in one paragraph.

20090129103110AAa0sOp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I let our daughter go to her cousin's beauty pageant? ?	Our daughter will be five in a few weeks. Her cousin (my niece) is six and does beauty pageants. She's invited us to come see her compete - and I just know our daughter will be jealous and want to enter pageants because she's very girly and loves to dress up. I disagree with pageants (no offense to any pageant moms) and I don't want our daughter wearing makeup or acting flirtatious. My niece wears these elaborate costumes and so much makeup - and even clip on teeth!       Should I take our daughter to see the pageant or make an excuse not to? I don't think it would upset my niece if our daughter didn't go - to be honest I think her mother (my sister-in-law) is the one who wants everyone to come see her daughter in the pageant.       Any thoughts? Am I overreacting? I just don't want to have to explain to our daughter that her cousin can do these things but I won't let her, too. Advice?

20090129113439AAqmiA4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	10 month old and foods....?	My son is 10 months old.   He eats Gerber baby food and foods we've pureed for him.   I know babies aren't supposed to necessarily like something the first time they try it...but he seems like he "like" a VERY limited amount.   He loves sweet potatoes.  We actually resorted to that for breakfast this morning because he wasn't digging cereal and fruits.   He loves pears and applesauce (not this morning).   He HATES any Gerber meats (and I don't blame him).   He'll gag on them - even when we mix them with a little fruit.   We started to try foods with him when he was six months- he really wasn't interested for about another 1-1/2 months and we didn't force anything.  He was a preemie- 7 weeks early.      We've let him play with Cheerios and Biter Biscuits...   he's just more interested in putting things into his mouth that aren't edible.      His iron level is great and he's gaining weight.  But he just doesn't like food.  Anyone else's baby not like food??

20090129122016AADQL2h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think about this name for a boy?	I'm not pregnant, and not planning on having a baby until I'm at least 27 (22 right now), but we really want to have a boy when the time comes. I know you can't really choose that, but if we do have a boy the name we chose is Guy Thomas Black. My fiance's middle name is Thomas, same as his father, so we're keeping that in the family. Obviously his last name is Black, but the name Guy has always been a favorite of mine, and surprisingly it's always been what HE wanted to name his son if he had one. His reasons are completely different from mine. My fiance is a HUGE goof, and he's very outgoing and absolutely hilarious, and he wants his son to be that way, too. So, his reasons for naming him that is that when he's in school, and they put name tags on the desk, last name first, his name will say Black Guy. lol. I actually think it's pretty funny. I don't see it as being a way to make fun of him or tease him, just something funny to talk about. My reasons are I've just always loved the name Guy. My fiance thinks it will mold him into a funny person with a good sense of humor. What do you think of the name?

20090129093435AAtLVwd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think they're right and I can't keep a secret?	My friends keep telling me that. And that I "tell everyone everything" and that they don't trust me. These are the only things that have happened to make them think that    -A mutual friend of ours told me that his dad was abusive. So I asked his girlfriend, one of my best friends, if she knew about his dad. I didn't say what though. She said she knew that his dad was abusive. But a few days ago another friend of ours asked her how she knew, and she said that I told her. When I said that she said she knew, she said that she didn't, and just figured it out when I told her.    -Another friend's boyfriend told me that he got an egagment ring for his girlfriend, aka my friend. This was a few months ago. I was going through my email a few days ago while I was on the phone with her, telling her everything he said. And I read where he mentioned the ring, not thinking anything of it. She freaked out and called him, and he said he told me not to tell her, but I'm sure he didn't. So both of them are mad at me.    -My best best friend told me what she thinks about another best friend of ours, but told me not to tell.. One day when she was mad at me and our best friend, and I thought our friendship was over, I told her what the other friend said. Because she asked me if the other girl ever liked her or if she was just pretending. I told her not to tell anyone she knew, but she did anyway. Btw, this is the same girl who said that I told her about our friend's dad when she said she knew.     I'm fourteen by the way, and my friends are all 13-17.    So now they just assume I tell everybody everything they say.
20090129110753AAOZpWE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Need help on how to politely get rid of the "help" from people?	I have a beautiful little girl who has a birth defect (Vesicoureteral Reflux, it's nicknamed VUR)where her ureters both have holes in them so her urine runs backwards into her kidneys causing infections galore. She has a high grade (pretty severe) We have her on medication to protect her kidneys cause too many infections and she has the possibility of having a kidney transplant. Hopefully, this will heal itself by the age of 6 or 7 years old without surgical intervention. Yes, she is closely watched by a specialist and her DR.      Here is the issue: She is going to be 3 in August. She is no where near being potty trained partly because she doesn't have the same kind of feelings that a child with no issues has. When people find out she isn't potty trained, I get unsolicited advice telling me how I am "doing it wrong" My wife and I decided not to push her whatsoever because it really isn't her fault she can't feel all the way. We are letting our daughter not feel bad at all for having accidents and are taking a carefree approach to it in general. All of our family is in complete support of this.      How do I tell people to butt out and leave her alone without being completely rude or having to explain her entire medical history??

20090129120040AA4B9mX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 1 year old baby is deeply attached to me, should I let her cry?	My 1 year old baby was really independently before. But since last week, she has been deeply attached to me, she cries everytime I'm not with her. Even her dad can't play with her or hold her when she's crying. I don't think she is teething or anything wrong with her because she is still very happy in the other time.   I already tried to do everything I can think of. She can't not walk yet. So she's sitting in high chair (right next to me) while I'm cooking. I talk to her, tell her stories, sing for her... But once she starts crying, nothing can stop her except holding her. But I don't want to spoil her like that and make her more dependent on me.    When she starts crying, can I let her cry and do nothing to stop her? Will that hurt her?    Thanks.

20090129114948AAD7YFO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms - tell me about your day! ?	I love hearing about other moms' days and how they compare to mine!   I have 6 year old twin girlies called Lily and April, a 3 year old son Tobias and a 6 week old baby girl called Isla.       It is nearly 8pm here now. I've had a bit of a bad day!    This morning Isla woke me up at 2am, 4am and finally 6am. I was exhausted! But I got the kids ready for school and dropped them off, and Tobias off at nursery. I got home and realised I'd left the twins' lunches at school so I took them there. At this point Isla was bawling her eyes out because she was hungry.    I fed her then she did the biggest sick-up ever!       I went to the shops later in the morning to get groceries, then had lunch at home with Isla. I met a friend for coffee before picking up my toddler and kids.       Tobias got in a fit with another little boy in the playground over a toy. Then April wet herself on the way home (it's a half hour walk). So that was a bit of a disaster!    They had teatime at about 5pm. Then I fed Isla and bathed her and Tobias together for the first time. It was ok actually! He has finally stopped hitting her so much. I then fed Isla with her and Tobias on my llap, then read Tobias a story while burping Isla. The girls were playing downstairs.    I then put Tobias and Isla to bed at 6.30pm, and went to be with my girls.    After spelling homework they had a bath at 7pm, and were in bed by 7.30pm.

20090129105534AA1wL23	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sharp, stabbing cervical pains during pregnancy? Anyone else experienced this or know what's up?	I'm 18 weeks pregnant, and every once in a while I'll get this sharp, stabbing pain in my cervix. It stops me dead in my tracks- but only lasts for seconds before going away. I've experienced this throught my pregnancy so far, and it doesn't happen too often, but every once in a while I get the sudden stab of pain. I haven't had any spotting or abdominal pain, just this.       Is what I'm feeling related to cervical changes during pregnancy? (although what those changes are exactly I'm not sure!) Or a sign of something else? Has anyone experienced what I'm talking about?

20090129121304AAaFyud	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could this be a pregnancy?	I started my period a couple of days ago, and on the first day only used 1 pad the entire day. I bleed the most at night, but when I woke up the next day there was nothing. I went the whole day with no bleeding, and Have had no bleeding today. I am however having major cramps that make me want to cry. My stomach is really tender to the touch. "my husband rub across my stomach last night and I screamed out in pain" Cleaning the house makes me hurt worse as well. I have had 2 pregnancy before and both children are healthy as can be. With my son I had a c-section and it feels like the pain is coming from the scar "as stupid as that sounds that's what it feels like" We are being extremely care full to not get pregnant "birth control pills and condoms are in use". Could I still have gotten pregnant, and it possibly be a tubal "or ectopic" pregnancy, or does it sound as though there is something else wrong. Oh and to add in the pain worsens when I set down to use the rest room..

20090129115256AAbO2h7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Birthday party at the russian tea room for a 9 y/o birthday party?	Last year for my daughters 8th birthday party ~ I hired a limo, booked a party at this cute "My Party Princess" place where she and her friends had a "Spa Day".  It was a lot of fun, and very cute.      Now we're turning 9.  I was thinking that it would be cute to host her party at the Russian Tea Room downtown in Chicago, do a desert sampler only (if I can get the chef to work with me on this) and serve tea... but I'm wondering if this would go over well for this age group or if I should be looking elsewhere..      Thank You!!!
20090129105651AAs6n4p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you curse around your children?	My husband and i both have I guess what you could call "dirty" mouths. We have 2 children, a 7 year old and a 10 month old. Our 7 year old does not curse, and he is a wonderful, sweet,  and (for the most part) respectful little boy. We do curse around him, but he knows what words are words that he isn't allowed to say because he is a child. Our reasoning behind this is that we are open with our kids, and we don't really want to act like perfect people when we are not. Now, we have cut back a bit since the baby is beginning to talk. We never curse around other people's children, because I respect that not all mothers feel this way. I am just curious to see how many other mothers are like me (but since Y!A is full of perfect mothers, I'm not expecting much :-)). Do you curse around your kids?   PS. Don't attack me...I'm a wonderful mother (my kids have everything they need, most of what they want, are well behaved and very much loved and taken care of), I just want to know how you feel about "Bad" words around your children.

She then, with holding the big pencil with her whole hand, drew a circle however the ends didn’t really meet. She kept on explaining to her mother that she had drawn a dog, her mother then praised her I think that she got a bit too over excited because she started to scribble over her ‘dog’.

20090129102443AAIHh9I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	2 year old crying "Everyone hates me"?	I took my 2yr 3 month old daughter playschool where I stay with her & she loves it, afterwards we went into town and she had the biggest screaming fit about everything, she kept saying she wanted something like toilet, food,water but everytime I tried to give her what she asked for she got more wound up.Her face was soaked with tears and everyone was staring like I was a bad mum, then when I asked why she was so upset she screamed loud "everyone hates me" and kept repeating it. No one around her has said anything like that for her to have picked it up , I went straight home and then she was fine but told her grandma the same thing on the phone.   I know I shouldn't worry about it but I feel sad that she feels that way, we couldn't do more for her and we are desperate for cuddles but she can't stand anyone getting too close to her, its like we irritate her most of the time.    Is it normal for a 2yr old to say things like that? My mum in law things its too early & she must have heard one of us say it but we have never said anything along those lines & the only thing she watches on TV is cbeebies, its more like what a teenager would come out with when going through puberty.
20090129104137AA2nh74	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do epidurals just not work on some people?	I had my little guy on the 13th, and tried the epidural again. Unfortunately, it only lasted a little while and wore off once it was time to push and it left me no time for any pain killers at all. So it was pointless and a waste of money.      With my first pregnancy, they had to continuously give me more and more, and it still didn't do anything near what it was supposed to do.      Does that mean that it just doesn't work for me or that they did it wrong?       Did it work for you or anyone that you know?

20090129104332AANH2eI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Potty Training a 3 year old?	My child has turned 3 and we are kind of desperate to get her potty trained.  Up until now we have not pushed it as we figured she would do it at her own pace.  For the last year she has shown interest and will occasionally tell us she has to go pee-pee and will go and get tons of praise.  Up until a week ago she wouldn't poo in the toilet at all.  She has done this once and has no desire to repeat it even though she got tons of praise and a prize.  While I understand that this is a long drawn out process with accidents and things, we are getting really frustrated.  My child will go to the bottom step and stand there whenever she has to go to the bathroom.  Doesn't matter if she's wearing panties or a diaper.  The steps are right next to the bathroom.  She always goes there when she has to potty.  Last night she went to the steps and peed and pooped.  She got it all over herself, the floor, the steps, etc.  To me, this isn't an accident.  She knew she had to go and instead of going to the bathroom she went to the steps.  What do we do to help her start going all the time in the bathroom??  We've tried rewards when she goes, we've tried praise, we've tried everything we can think of but she still goes to the steps.  She wanted to wear panties again today but I wouldn't let her.  She NEVER tells you she has to go.  We ask every hour and she'll say no.  We try to get her to sit on the toilet and at least try and she won't.  She throws a fit.  MInd you... she was the one who insisted on wearing panties.  Now we are getting to the point where she comes to us when she has panties on and says she needs a diaper and refuses to go sit on the toilet.  As soon as you put a diaper on her, she goes.  So it isn't that she doesn't know when she has to go.  Please help... we could really use some advice.  No rude comments please.

He already knows that he would be really happy if I got pregnant and we had a baby.  It's just that he's afraid to start actually trying.

They live in England now, and speak Spanish daily.      They have two boys, Valentin Juanito (6) and Quique Timoteo (4). They both speak English perfectly, and don't even have a Spanish accent, but people always speak slowly to them because they have Spanish sounding names. I always said it would be bad to name them with such Spanish names, but their parents said it wouldn't be. Now, it obviously is.      Do you think it's wrong to give your kids such foreign sounding names if you're living in England?      Also, they have a daughter on the way, and want to call her Isabella Grace,  which doesn't sound Spanish at all. What do you think about this? Would I be right to tell them they should choose something more Spanish despite what I said before?

20090129102015AAjStGz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	About my child's last name..?	Well im 31 weeks prego and my babys name was going to be Camarii Jamell Mackey.. but now my bf/baby daddy is saying he wants him to have his moms last name and not his because he wants to get his changed to her too.. (Lawrence) reason for change is because his last name is the name of a man that is not his daddy so he has either his moms or dads name and wants to change it to his moms therefore he was me to name our son with his moms last name so it will be the same as his when he changes it but there is a chance he will never have it change because of all the stuff you have to go through to get it changed.. so my question is should I give him is grandma (on his daddys side) last name or what??

20090129113831AAn4T9A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	13 month old does not want to eat food just his bottle, suggestions?!?	Hello,      My 13 month old will not eat any food.  I can get him to eat maybe a piece of fruit but that's it.  He is slowly eating a chicken nugget but that's only about 1/3 of the piece.  He is sick (congested) and with a cough that doesn't let him (or mommy and daddy) sleep at night.  I want to give him some nutritious food but I'm out of ideas other than forcing the food in (which he spits out).  Any ideas would be appreciated.
20090129114038AAIkwp1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	13 month old needs white noise to sleep??? Please help :)?	My daughter Ava is now 13 months old and she is a HORRIBLE sleeper. I don't know if it is from the teething, or it has become a reflex for her to wake up often. She goes to bed around 9:00 every night (usually without a fight) and wakes up every 30-60 minutes after wards. Last night however, it was cold here in Los Angeles and we had to turn on the heater and when when the heater went on, she would fall asleep, right when it would shut off, she would wake up 5 minutes after wards. So, I was wondering if this "white noise" really helps children sleep through the night, and was wondering if there is an actual store that I can purchase it from. I prefer not to order but will if it's my last resort. Thanks in advance.

The dr. said everything is fine except for the fact that the baby has the cord wrapped around the neck and then through the legs. I asked her if this was something to worry about and she said "no". Everyone I talked to since then stated that they would be worried because babies can die this way!! What do I do? Is it something I need to worry about?      Thanks

20090129120724AAh1u6l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Possibly pregnant. Could I be?	I had my period Jan. 8th 2009 and ended it Jan. 13th 2009(or a day before or a day after). I've been trying to conceive I guess. Well lets just say we weren't exactly being careful. Well anyway, I started spotting(really light pinkish-sometimes brownish- blood) for a couple of days. Probably like two. It's also sometimes kinda dischargy- like the way it looks.)I feel fine. I'm get nauseous every now and then. Certain foods kinda mess up my stomach right now(but there's a tummy virus that's been going around. havent got it yet. dont think i will) and I've been going back and forth between minor constipation and diarrhea. Been more tired than usual. Those are really the only things that are happening right now though. So if I were to be pregnant it would only be like two and half weeks or so(?). Does this sound usual and is there a possibility that I am indeed pregnant? I hope so :) I'm not expecting my next period until the 10th or so.

After I had my daughter I wanted another baby very soon, but my fiance was not ready.  That feeling never went away for me, but I respected his decision and we waited until she was old enough to understand, and give her "HER TIME" u know?  So then we had our son, and he is 4.5months old, and now here I am already wanting another baby!  It's driving me NUTS.  Does this feeling ever go away???  Why do I feel this way?  I would LOVE to try again, but like before, my fiance says "NOOOOOOOOOO WAY!"  LMAO.  I'm a stay at home Mom, and LOVE it.  After having my daughter, I have been the happiest I have EVER been in my entire life.  It feels like...this is what I was meant to do in a way...But the urge to have another baby is driving me NUTS.  I Love both of my kids very very much, so it has NOTHING to do with not loving them...Did anybody else feel this way after having their kids?

20090129112512AAnS84k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do babies take lessons in the womb?	I have a theory that all babies get taught certain classes while they are still in the womb.   Have you ever wondered how babies know how to get out of being held or picked up?  They always put their arms in the air, arch their backs and go limp.  It is impossible to hold on to them when they do this.
20090129113826AAOWfQM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think we are blind when it comes to our own children?	I've noticed alot of people on here saying how their child would never act a certain way, and how much better behaved their own children are compared to others.  Even parents outside of Yahoo (yes there are some) have similar thoughts.  So many people say they believe their children are better behaved than average.  Which of course does not make sense.  Are we more critical of other children than our own?  Are we blind to some of the behaviours of our children because we see all the good qualities as well, as opposed to just witnessing a melt down from a child in a store?  Or is it just ego that makes us think we are better than average.
20090129112122AA3HIgs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do parents treat their sons better than their daughters?	When I was a child me and my twin sister were always hit by my dad with belts and hangers (not anymore because I moved out)   my mom and dad used to smoke and drink when we we're born      then when my brother came along the day he was born because they both were so excited he was a boy they stopped smoking and drinking and still haven't to this day (his 17 now) and he doesn't have breathing problems were as me and my sister do.      haha well its there loss, I feel sorry for them. now they have an ugly a$s son who is pale skinned with hardly any hair, fat and he hardly even talks to them. I would have thought that two identical twin girls are more special then one boy      but WHY DO PARENTS TREAT THERE SONS BETTER ??? when a son is a son until he gets married, a daughter is for life (my grandma used to always say that.)
20090225130911AAZTwgX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why wont my 1 year old eat solids anymore, please help!?	My 13 month old used to eat anything and everything. We would give her, beans, lentils, chicken soup, totillas, eggs, fish anything and she would eat it. About a week and a half ago I noticed that she has been refusing her solids. The only thing she will accept is fruit. My aunt takes care of her while my husband and I are at work. When I call my aunt to see how she is doing she tells me how Emma is eating the things I pack in her lunch bag or what ever my little cousin or aunt are eating. But when she is with her father or I its like we have to fight her to eat. We have tried not giving her milk but after an hour of struggling with her she gets so cranky and fussy and still refuses to take anything but her bottle.    I have also noticed that she is now waking up at night. She used to sleep though the whole night around 11-12hrs straight but now she wakes up after five or six hours. I try not to give her milk until about an hour has gone by and she is still tossing and turning. I have noticed that her gums are more swollen especially the area around her "canines". We also took her to the dentist about 2 weeks ago and he noticed that one of her molars/premolars were coming out.    Could this be why my daughter is refusing to eat solids with us?    I dont know if this has anything to do with this but she has also been very clingy with me lately. I am pregnant again. I notice that when we get home at the end of the day/weekends she just wants me to be holding/hugging her.     I seriously dont know what to do anymore. I am now gotten to the point where I am chasing her around the house every hour or so just offering her new foods and all she does is looks at me and smiles (grr). What is going on!? Please help me any advice/suggestions I can get would really help.       Thank you very much for taking the time.

20090128092117AAJosd4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mommies, how can I help my miserable, teething little man?	Mason has 2 bottom teeth that are just about to break the skin. He's so miserable and pitiful. He woke up at 7:30 this morning and has screamed until about 5 minutes ago (11:15) when I finally got him settled and down for a nap.       No matter what I do, he screams. I tried plating, going for a walk, looking in the mirror, and he's just miserable.       He doesn't take a pacifier and he won't chew on a frozen rag or teether ring. He just throws them down. I tried to hold it for him so he could just chew it and he just screamed. He's usually a very happy baby, so all this screaming is really getting to me. I have been giving him tylenol for the pain, but I'm not comfortable giving him medicine all the time.         What else can I do?
20090225123204AAnH7sI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I think woman who breastfeed are awesome people.  However,?	I don't understand the whole breastfeeding past like a year or a year and a half.  Is it really necessary to breastfeed for that long.        I couldn't breastfeed for personal reasons and I couldn't get the baby to latch on right.  Neither could any of the LC people from the hospital.  I have huge nipples, but that is a whole different story.  lol   I formula feed exclusively, and on the can its says from birth to 12 months.      Why breast milk after 12 months?        I just saw a thing where this lady breastfed one child until he was 5, and another until she was like 4.  Is it really necessary for that long?  It's totally none of my business I guess.  I just don't understand how woman could be comfortable doing it for that long.  It seems to me that if the child can talk and ask for it, they are too old to be getting it.

She won't go get socks or underwears in her drawer because she says there's alligators in it, she says there's mean wolves under her carpet. And I was wondering if there are any good books that I can read to her maybe about fears or that there is nothing to worry about. The fears are constant and daily and she's just really afraid of a lot. And she is seen by a therapist who helps her but I was just wondering if you mommies had any ideas of how I can help her cope. We went to an indoor playground yesterday and she wouldn't go climb and play inside because she said that there were mean wolves in there to eat her...so it's even hard to take her out places because she is constantly afraid. I just need your advice

20090128085737AAyUM7Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Did your toddler have a big chance at 3 years old?	I have heard that at 3 years old toddlers have this big transformation and just all of a sudden it's possible to do things with them and they are more interested in sitting and playing, etc.  I was just wondering what everyone's experience with 3 year old kids are, especially 3 year old boys!    My son is 2 years and 9 months old -- 3 months until the big birthday!  I love him so much, but he is driving me nuts!  He doesn't listen to anything (I don't expect him too listen to it all and be perfect, I understand he is still a kid and will still be at 3 and 4 and 5, etc.).  But it's gotten to the point where he can be told to stop 15 times, be removed from the situation by my husband or myself, have toys taken away, and still go back and do it 5 minutes later!  Right now it is hard because we can't do the "send him to his room" thing, as we are living with my in-laws until we close on our house, so there are 4 of us in the bedroom - my husband, me, our son, and our daughter who is 1 year and 9 months old.  The only things in the bedroom are everyone's bed and a bureau.  If he was put in there he would jump on our bed, which is too high up if he falls, and he would climb on the bureau, as well as destroy everything on it (a night lamp, radio, alarm clock, fan).   He doesn't want to play with his toys, he just wants to dump them all in a pile and run through them and drive over them with his ride on toys.  I think this will all be solved when we move, as he used to play with toys, but right now there is no room to put anything, so I think he is getting overwhelmed with every toy both he and his sister have being in one room - the living room!  But it is even getting hard to take him out in public.  We have ever since he was born, but we can no longer take him out to eat, as he is getting worse and worse!  We always took him grocery shopping and to the mall, thinking he would get better if we let him go with us, but it is so we can't even take him anymore.  He refuses the cart and refuses to hold our hands to walk.  He takes off running or starts touching everything on the shelves.  Luckily he has only broken 1 jar of salsa one time....  And he is getting his sister to start in on these things too!  I am just at my end!  I think when we move it will solve everything for the most part, as he never used to act this way.

20090128094341AAzECN2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	At what age did your toddler start?	counting backwards?  My son is 2 years and 9 months old and he just did it today!  He has been counting up to 20 by himself with understanding for about 6 months now, but I didn't want to confuse him by teaching him to count backwards. Well, I have been at my end with him today, but not taking it out on him since it is not his fault (it is our living situation in living with Grandma and Grandpa - my in laws).  He had just been squealing and screaming and running around plowing through everything, including his sister.  Than all of a sudden he decided to be his old self again and sit down and play and we were talking and he says, Mommy I think I can count backwards.  I said, oh really?  And he says, Yeah, Listen.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1      I am so proud!  When did your child first start doing this?

20090129122149AApGHyK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Weirdest Dream you can remember while pregnant?	So last night I had this dream where I was pregnant (I am 16 weeks 6 days now) and I was getting ready to go to my ultrasound appointment when I went into labor, I would have only been 20 weeks at this point.  I wasn't able to make it to the doctors office and I gave birth to two sets of twins right there in the kitchen- two boys, two girls.  However, 1 girl was mentally challenged and the other girl was a genius and the same- 1 boy was mentally challenged and the other boy was a genius. (I don't know how I knew they were smart, it is one of those dream things)  I remember at this point crying.  After that though my husband and everyone else in the world turned on me and the 4 kids and were constantly mad at us.  Then I got pregnant again, only this time I was carrying only one baby.  I was trying to get my husband to go with me to my appointment when his mother came down and started whispering in his ear bad things about me.  He then pretty much turned into her puppet, saying really awful things and made me go by myself.  I was then driving to my appointment and I tried to call my husbands cell phone and he shut it off so I started crying again.  Only this time I actually woke up crying and I never did make it to either of my ultrasound appointments because I woke up during the drive to the second one.   I have to say that that was the weirdest dream I have had pregnant thus far.        Do any of you ladies remember some of your strange dreams?  What were they?

My question is since I had 2 mature follicles present does that mean if i become pregnant this cycle it is a very high chance of it being twins? I know they say clomid has about an 8-10% chance of increasing twins but do all women have 2 follicles or am I apart of the 8-10%?

20090129112540AAx7nIu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is labor closer then 3 weeks away?	I know there are a lot of questions asking "when will my baby come" or "does this mean he is coming soon?" Well, I guess I'll add to the pot and ask one kind of similar. I am 37 weeks and my doc told me today I'm about 80% effaced, but not dilated. He also said his head is not abnormally low, but extremely low. His head has been low for the last several doctor's appointments and recently I started to feel a lot of pain, tremendous pain, in my lower back. I also feel tons of pressure and pain in my vagina and I think I am feeling what are contractions in my abdomen. The Dr. said I just am feeling this because the babe is so low. I guess I would like to know if is sounds like labor is sooner then 3 weeks away? Is my Doctor not taking my pain seriously? And if his head is so low, does this mean that once labor does start, or when I do start to dilate will it move pretty quickly? Any advice, or suggestions will help. Hope everyone out there knows a little more then I do!!!!!!:)
20090129113948AAL0Du4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy & work, advice please x?	my work place is like a sauna as it's soooo hot, I'm not the only person who moans about the heat.   I've asked for the heat to be turned down as it makes me fell unwell (headaches, sickness and dizzy) and extremely grumpy but I was told that it's not possible to turn it down as other areas of the office would then become too hot... it must be broken.   However, a lady in the office has a fever of some sort and permanently complains that it's too cold!  so the manager turns the heat up even more!   It sounds silly to say it but sometimes the heat makes me feel like crying or walking out at least, I can't take it anymore.  My face even feels like it's burning up sometimes and everyone else is sweating buckets.   There are no windows due to the computers (I think) and I don't feel that I should have to spend my money on personal air conditioning when it's their responsibility.      Do I have any rights on health and safety grounds?  Could overheating affect my baby?   They have not even done a risk assessment yet and I'm 25 weeks!  I work 11 hours a day so I feel like I should at least be comfortable.      I would love some info to present my manager with as I'm thinking of making an official complaint.

20090129113953AA1StcW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do I have a voice on the abortion issue as a man - please read below?	I have asked questions about it and there is always some rationally bankrupt chick who gives some simplistic dismissal to my valid arguments. And many of you are this chick. It goes like this: "You are a man; that is reason enough for me not to care what you think. You never have been pregnant. You never will be pregnant. You dont have the right to tell a woman anything in regards to it, end of discussion."      To that I would reply "I'm not a doctor either, I guess I have no right to discuss the ethics of health-care either. I'm not a policeman or lawyer so I suppose my opinion about justice in society is worthless. But why stop there? I don't have children an don't want them so I guess I shouldn't tell a parent to stop abusing their kid."      Are there any rational libs who see the glaring error in the mindless chick answer? I'm not trying to be facetious here. There's always an intelligent lib in every crop, but I don't want to make that hasty assumption.
20090225121052AACQ9kT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about the sex of baby.?	I have never been pregnant (and I am not now) so this might be a dumb question. But, I was just curious as to what happens when you DON'T want to know the sex of the baby at your 'big' ultrasound?      Do you see what is happening up on a screen? Or do they show you pictures? Is there a way to block out 'down there' or would they just not show the lower region? Do they tell you to turn around? I am just curious, as I fear I'd be able to tell whether it was a boy or girl on my own. I have done a an online boy or girl ultrasound quiz and I done pretty well.      Did anyone know the sex before the ultrasound technician/nurse/doctor told them based on what they saw on the screen?

20090128085357AA4DRKo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How to deal with my girlfriends overprotective parents?	I'm 26, my girlfriend is 23 going on 24 in a few months and over the past 16 months of us going out it has been interesting.  Her parents are roman catholic italian, but do not come across too strict at first, but in many ways I can tell they have babied her and it seems as though they have tried to put in place extra boundaries since our relationship has gotten serious.       I am concerned her parents affect her decision making in our relationship more than needs to be and has actually been the source of serious confict, indirectly and directly.  my main concern is how long this will go on for or if it will ever change.  I cannot have my partner's every decision controlled or questioned by her parents, especially if it's very serious stuff like running a business one day, or buying houses, or what to do with our children.  Not now, but in the future.         Examples:      Their youngest daughter, 18, in college, just called home to tell her mom that she has a boyfriend who goes to another school in the state next to ours.  Well all hell broke loose at home because the kid has dredlocks, the mom was freaking out, playfully, but still freaking out.  Now they are going down to her school this weekend to have a "chat" with her to dissaude her from going to visit her boyfriend since they feel she shouldn't have to go visit him.      I think it is a ploy to be overprotective, and I've seen this kind of crap they pull with my girflriend.  Problem is my girflriend not only lives with them, but she works for them in their office so the control factor is double.        Thank god i'm not dating her sister.      However, her mom controls my girlfriends finances. Her name is on her checks like they are married or something.  I know it's a student checking account.  Problem is my girlfriend doesn't have access to her own bank statements!!      This makes me mad because I need her to be independent from her parents so that way we can make decisions on our own.        Every time it snows just a little bit, her parents freak and don't let her drive to come stay with me.       The girl graduated college 2 years ago!!      They fix her car at this crappy way overpriced auto place all the time and don't let her make any decisions as to where to fix her own car.  Meanwhile they probably spend more on " fixing" her perfectly fine car every year than on car payments on a new car.  She is afraid to take it somewhere else because they will be mad.      My parents asked us to come visit them since they are staying in florida for the next few months.  Her mom wont hear it because we already took a vacation recently, even though she has 2 weeks paid vacation and should be able to take the time, and she didn't even mention anything about needing the help at work.       I know my girlfriend is a little frustrated too, but it seems only since I've started talking to her about it about how I'm frustrated with it.      I asked my girflriend to move in with me, and the first thing she mentioned was that she had to talk to her parents about it.

When I had my now 18 month old I breast fed her for 3 months until I literally dried up one day. Well I want to breastfeed again, but I just feel wierd about doing so infront of my daughter who will be just over 2 at the time. I mean I know a 4 YO who has seen her mom breastfeed her twin brother and sister and now walks around breastfeeding her barbies!! And to me that is GROSS! She also talks about it all the time. I dunno when I had my daughter I was alone with her so when I fed her it was quiet bonding time, it was "private" for us. But to me to sit on my couch and whip it out so-to speak infront of a 2YO and then try and make her understand the whole idea, and the idea of privacy ect. seems like too much for me. Also I know pumping is an option however I refuse to have that be the main way I feed my baby. I'm an all or nothing kind of person so  2 is either breast fed-from the breast or they get formula (no earlier then 4 weeks old though). Has anyone else had this nervous feeling about it? Does that ever go away? I've always been a very private person, even when  1 was born I made my hubby leave the room when I breastfed, so I cant imagine...?
20090129114435AAf90zf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	"Mushy" Poops at 2 yrs and 2 months?	My 2 year old son has always had soft poops.  He has never had a "formed" poop to my knowledge.  I never thought much about this until I was talking to his day care provider about potty training and she said:    Well, what worries me is his poops are still so mushy.     ???? I am totally confused.  Is it abnormal for a 2 year old?????  I always thought it was a sign he had a good digestive system.  What do you think?

20090225122539AAdIkVB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Skin rash on 1 1/2 yr old... pics included?	I did already call the pediatrician, who said to wait to come in til his 18 mo. checkup next Weds (since he isn't bothered by it, and it completely disappears). Here's our scenario:   -rash when he woke up Mon & Tues morning that went away within 30 minutes of waking   -rash came again after his morning nap today and vanished within a 1/2 hr again      The rash is only on his legs and arms... not trunk, butt, or face. It's very inflamed, and looks like huge welts on his skin. I looked up Eczema, but this rash isn't bothering/itching my son at all. I've been putting Aquaphor on it when it shows up, and then it just completely vanishes Here are pics of his leg & arm (doesn't show how raised it is though):  http://s397.photobucket.com/albums/pp55/...     http://i397.photobucket.com/albums/pp55/...       ...I should add that he has had 2 cases of MRSA in the past, but neither looked anything like this, as the infection was localized, constant and worsened. Also, he hasn't eaten anything different, has no known allergies, we haven't switched detergents, and his jammies are the same he's been wearing 6 months. His room is kept at a comfortable temp. Anyone seen anything like this?
20090128094637AAfupEu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Family problems and 2 boys Please help!!!! some much going on?	Ok i'll try not to go everywhere with this but it's hard to sum it up. Please don't judge i know this will sound bad but it's just whats on my mind. Ok i have 2 young boys 9mos and 2yrs. anyway the past 4yr been real crazy with the money problems, my bf losting his job and bills and living with a roomate and her 4 kids and i place i hate that just nasty. Anyways i got a chance now to move to Fl. my aunt needs help with her nurseing home. It was looking good expect for the fact that she moves alot and there my only family there and a new problem came up my bf. which brings me to my second problem my bf we just found out he has lupus which his mom died from when they were young. And now there so much going on i want my boys to be around there father as muchas they can. And because his grandpa died he was trying to stay here with his grandma anyways. but because he has no job his grandma wasn't going to take him back in her house anyways. I  just can't get my self together up here i want to go back to school but i need!!! my own place and i can't do both plus i can't find a good job i'm working 2 jobs now and can't take to much more of this. Plus i hate to say this but I'm thinking of is anything does happen to my bf where would that leave me were not married(he says he wants to wait till he has money and were older were 25 now) I didnt do child support because he was helping me and because of his sickness he couldnt keep a job. His grandma his life insurance on him but i really dont think she'll give me any money and i really wouldn't fight her for it cause she been taking care of my bf since he was 6 when has mom pasted so she earned it even though i'm the one paying the monthly cost now cause he's not working i wouldnt feel right.    I mean she barley talks to my kids now she doesnt buy them any gifts, she won't even watch them or even holds my youngest which doesnt' bug me much i mean there her great grands and she been taking care of kids her whole life. She only had her daughter(my bf mom) and now she has her grandson(my bf brother) child cause her mom died from asuma and he while lets just say she doesnt trust the girl he staying with now, she 7yr. I know this is alot and just advise me the best you can i'm kinda everywhere. But i guess to sum it up. Should i move? am i wrong for feeling this way about the money and his grandma. And what should i do.
20090128090748AAjhtYU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Confused anyone had this happen, and still pregnant?	ok, So I took a test 12dpo. It showed a VERY faint line (after the ten minutes) but it was pink as the control line. Took more after that and all negative. Now, i was due for my period the 23rd. It however did not come. on the 24th I had pink when I wiped.. the 25th it was a little reddish/brown only when I wiped.  then yesterday I started my period I think?  IT is alot lighter than normal. ( usually I fill up a overnight pad in an hour and and a half ) "suffer from endo" This seems to be red/brown but nowhere near as heavy as normal !  I did take a test again this morning and it's negative. could this be implantation bleeding? today is lighter than yesterday and more dark red ...    Also, I usually have Horrifying pain in my lower back and stomache with my periods.. I don't right now!!!!

20090128090302AAqW8M2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	These hCG levels have me worried.?	I'm about 10 weeks pregnant right now. Everything I've read says that hCG levels should be doubling every 24-96 hours. Here are what mine have been.      January 15--66,000   January 17--74,000   January 19--77,000   January 25--80,000      Even in 10 days (the 15th to the 25th) they haven't come close to doubling. My regular doctor tells me they're "fine." The ER doctor I saw on the 25th said they were increasing so my body is sustaining the pregnancy. I know all I can really do is trust what the doctors tell me, but I suspect they may be glossing it over.      I've had brown vaginal discharge most of January and red spotting one morning. I've been to the ER twice, to my regular doctor once and I have another appointment on February 4th.      I'm just wondering a couple things:  Can the pregnancy be healthy with hCG levels like this? Maybe someone else has been through something similar and can let me know. Second, if I continue to sustain the pregnancy will the fact that my hCG levels aren't doubling have a negative effect on the baby?      Thanks to anyone who can reassure me or let me know that I'm worried for a good reason.
20090129110259AABUAsW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When should I stop working? (little long, sorry)?	I'm currently just about 32 weeks pregnant. I work as the office manager for a company that moves pianos cross-country. I'm in charge of just about everything (small business) Payroll, Accounting, Scheduling, etc. I am wondering when I should schedule to stop working.      I've heard a lot of people say that they work right up until their due dates, or go early and just don't go into work the next day. I can't really do this because I would have to have a plan for how to cut paychecks and banking and tax checks every week. The whole of my work isn't finished at the end of each day.      My boss and I have decided that when I have the baby, he is going to pretty much take over the office phones (by having calls either forwarded to his cell or checking messages). However I was still planning on doing the bookkeeping VERY PART TIME after the baby was born. So basically because of the nature of the business, I have to schedule a date to be done.      My pregnancy is going fine so far. Although I look and feel like I am a lot further along. I was on the birth control pill when we conceived, and they only did one ultrasound. We do have a slight history of early deliveries in my family (my brother was born at 33 weeks); so I'm wondering when would be an appropriate time to schedule off.

My daughter is going to be 4 in April (real soon) and I`ve been ttc for 6 months. I didn`t want to wait this long to start trying for our 2nd, but my husband didn`t want to have a baby yet, and we did have some important family plans (moving to another country) that having a baby right then, would`ve been too complicated for us.    Finally he agreed to start ttc but things have gotten complicated and I`m seeing that I`ll be having my 2nd baby many years apart from my 1st one, more than I wanted to. If I get pregnant this year, 4 years...   Mothers who have kids this many years apart...tell me it`s going to be ok! Give me some great reasons why this is not such a bad thing!

Here's my issue, I'm unsure now if I want to try again.  I would be overjoyed if I was still pregnant, but now I'm thinking I want to wait awhile and am starting to feel guilty for that.

20090128091324AAxa1Ut	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to help my five year old behave better?	I need some advice on my son. He is five and started kindergarten this year. At first he had a really hard time because he likes to talk and do his own thing. In September I had a baby and that it was because of that. He would swat peoples bottoms and do other things that might be fine at home but not at school. I had to meet with the teacher and principal. Then he started doing really well learning a lot and behaving better. He even received the most improved award. Now he is behaving badly. The teacher says he doesn't seem to care if he gets in trouble or has privileges taken away. I have him practice reading and his homework and let him know he needs to listen to teacher and be a good boy at school. I don't know what to do. I try to get him treats if he gets a good number. (This school gives a number from 1-10 based on how well they do each day) I don't know if being around my mom a lot can be a cause of this. We spend a lot of time with her because she helps me with a lot of things but she treats him like a baby and lets him get away with anything. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

20090225122657AAsbWie	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I get my husband to help more with the baby?	My husband and I were engaged and 4 months later we found out we had a baby on the way. I was still living with my parents and he works out of town all the time (gets 2 weeks off everything 3 months), so we knew we needed to get a place where he works (works in oilfield, but same city). Our son is 4 months and we just got our place, so now hubby can come home every night. He works every day from 5am to 5pm, so I don't expect him to do much. I take care of all the house work, errands, and the baby. When he comes home our little one is only up for another 2 or 3 hours, but he hardly spends any time with him. He barely feeds him or tucks him in. I love our son, but by the time he gets home I'm ready for a break. I even changed his sleeping schedule so that his first night time feeding would be when my hubby wakes up for work. It was his idea to do this so I could get more rest at night (remember I've been doing this practically every night since I had him), but he couldn't even get up early enough to have 15 minutes to (seriously thats all it takes lol) feed our son. How do I talk to him about helping out more? I know he works and is tired so I don't expect what few hours he has to be completely devoted to our son, but I do expect him to help. Anyone out there that has found a way to bring this up and have a real conversation about it that won't end in an argument or resentment?       p.s. I've heard some nasty responses before about its the woman's job to take care of kids 24/7 etc. Well guess what, if that was the case then we wouldn't need a man to procreate. Children are both partners responsibility and every person needs a break at some point from their job whatever it may be, I'm just trying to find a better median between 24/7 childcare and housework with my hubby.

I am engaged... my fiance and I have not been TTC, but we aren't very careful about being protected when we have intercourse. I am not using any type of birth control and my period is usually pretty heavy & regular...      I had my cycle in December like normal, but my January cycle came early and was lighter than usual. I think it was still too heavy to be implantation bleeding. I had cramps like I normally do, but it was still a lighter period than usual. I have been getting headaches really bad off and on for the last few weeks and this morning I woke up and my left lower back (I think it might be my kidney) is killing me. I have not felt nautious at all and my appetite hasn't changed either. I plan on taking a test... I'm just curious to everyone's thoughts.

He told me to give him 1 1/2 tsp miralax a day for 3-4 days, then give him the same dosage every other day for a few weeks.  I have been giving him the dosage for 8 days now and he did get a little better for about 3 days, but now has returned to the way he was before.  His tummy is rock hard and I can feel, when I do baby massage, a lot of substance in there.  He acts fine all day like nothing is bothering him then he screams bloody murder when he has to go.  Sometimes he produces a little mush but usually nothing comes out.  When he started this whole thing at about 8 1/2 months, I did stimulate his poop with a q-tip and vaseline and it worked, but only the one time.  I have tried twice since then with no results.  A friend suggested I try Fleet supporsitories.      For diet he has his milk which he has never had a problem with,  he eats applesauce, green beans, squash, yogurt melts, toasted cheerios.  I have tried prunes, but I could tell his tummy cramped up because he was up all night with a belly ache.  I would like to move on to table food, but with the pooping issues I am afraid to move to thicker substances.  He drinks about 4 ozs. of water a day and his milk is about 30 ozs.        Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I have searched the web for simular questions and their answers have not helped me yet.

I am on the pill, and I take it on schedule, only missing a couple times and always taking it as soon as I remember (and not missing at all this month). I had my period this month from 2-3 to 2-7, which is right on schedule. I had sex on the 8th and he didn't withdraw and again on the 14th where he did. I've been nauseous for a little over a week now, but it's not isolated to any particular time (morning, night). It's all the time, with a few hours here and there where I feel alright. My breasts aren't tender or sore (in fact, I don't notice any difference in the color of my nipples or the way my breasts feel). I'm wondering if I might be psyching myself into thinking I am, because we just found out my best friend is pregnant, too. Everyone says I should wait to take a home test until after I miss my period, which should be coming up in a few days, and I'm still taking my pill. Any help would be greatly apreciated.

I'm ttc for my first time.      I've been tracking my BBT and using fertilityfriend.com. The past 6 days my temp has risen. I ovulated on the 19th.      I had intercourse these days before ovulation: Tuesday the 13th, Thursday the 15th, and Sunday the 18th (which was the day before ovulation). So it was pretty much every other day. He came in me all 3 times.      My temp has also risen. Its usually anywhere from 96.1 - 96.8   But the past 6 days its been anywhere from 97.2 - 97.7      Since sunday, I have been having some symptoms. My breasts are sore, seem swollen, and are heavy. And I never get breast tenderness around my period time. Ever. (they just dont feel like usual, ya know?) I've also been a little nauseated. But that seems to come and go.   But I'm not supposed to start my period until Monday.   I've heard of alot of people tho, get symptoms very early on.      Is there a chance I'm pregnant? Good chance or not so good?      I also heard if your temp stays elevated for 12-16 days, its a good indicator your pregnant?      I'm just not sure, and need advice.   Help please.   Thanks and baby dust to everyone!      God Bless.

Just curious ^_^ I've heard the first usually goes later, but I'm not sure if that is a wives tale or not as I've also heard of a lot of babies being born early.

Before I got pregnant I figured we'd wait until 12 weeks, but now that it has happened we don't think we can wait that long! I wouldn't mind telling close family soon, but the problem is once we tell my husband's family, all his extended family will know within an hour...they can't keep a secret to save their lives lol!      My first ultrasound is scheduled for 6 weeks, 5 days along, and I've had no bleeding or bad cramping, so we're thinking if the Dr. hears a strong heartbeat we will tell people that weekend (it will be my husband's bday).       What do you think? How long did you wait and would you have waited longer or told people sooner if you could do it over again?      Thanks!

BUT...I am a little worried, need some other moms or preggers to help put my mind at ease...      I will be 9 weeks tomorrow.   2 weeks ago, I have a small amount of spotting the day after my b/f and I had sex, it was only when I wiped (tmi)(sorry) and only lasted a day, (first was red, then orange-ish, then pink) . I went to the ER, they were rude, but basically said if I was not bleeding heavily or cramping, not to worry.   I do have all prego symptoms..I have to pee every 5 minutes, and I am not exagerating, and still have sore/full breasts, only nauseated on occasion, and am super tired and hungry!   Tried to hear the heartbeat yesterday at midwife appt. but could not, a little early. I have a sonogram scheduled for tomorrow and I am super excited about it, but nervous too. I am worried that maybe its eptopic, (I have not had any pain though, just the usual pregnancy cramps, and pulling etc.) or spotting since that day......seems fine I guess, my clothes are fitting snugger, but I have not gained any weight yet....feel very bloated!!      So....reading internet blogs and all, it looks like I am okay...but...still can't help but worry a little....okay maybe alot. Some internet sites can be confusing....some can scare you....so maybe I should not be reading/looking, but am paranoid that maybe we we have the sonogram it will be bad:(      Any advice/words of encouragement???
20090128103541AA2kOpV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When registering, should you invite people to go with you?	We are having a little girl, and my husband really isn't into shopping and I prefer to do it without him. He didn't mind me going to register for the baby without him, and was actually relieved that I didn't force him to go.       I asked my mother if she wanted to come with me since this is my first and I really didn't know what I would need to pick out.  She said yes and we were supposed to go a few weeks ago but that morning her house burned down so we canceled. My mother inlaw knew that we were planning to go, because I told her. She didn't say anything about wanting to go, and to be honest, I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I already knew the bedding I was going to pick and the furniture for the nursery.        So this weekend my mom and I went as a last minute thing to get my mom out of the apartment she is now living in and to help her relax a little bit. So while we were at the store, I really only picked out small things like a breast pump, bottles, diaper genie, monitors as well as the crib, glider and dresser for the nursery (but like I said before I already knew which ones I was going to pick-it was just a matter of scanning them into the registry). Everything else as far as the pack n play, high chair, car seat, bedding (and everything to match for the nursery), etc. I wanted to look up online for safety ratings so I didn't pick them until after I got home and could research reviews online. Also for the bedding, they didn't have it in the store, so I could only pick it online.       My mom has previously said she would buy the crib and mattress and my MIL also knew this because again I told her to avoid any issues or problems. There isn't much communication between our mothers and I'm pretty much the middle man-so I rather than create a problem in the future, I let everyone know what is going on ASAP (our wedding was a mess and things haven't been the same with the moms since then).      So last night, my MIL sent my hubby a text saying "I'm going to buy the crib and mattress." He called her and told her that my mom was still planning on buying it, well she got very upset and said "well what am I supposed to buy then?" and then went on to complain about how she should have been invited to go with us when we registered because she feels like she isn't wanted and is going to be slighted with everything concerning the baby.      Was I really wrong for not inviting her, or is she being a little to sensitive? Did you have anyone go with you to register? I feel that she could have spoken up several weeks ago when we were planning to go, if not to me than to her son. I wouldn't have cared if she went or knowing that she wanted to go-my mom and I aren't big on shopping but his mom is and she can be a bit pushy with what she likes, but regardless had I known she wanted to be included, I would have invited her.

My son is 5 weeks old and he always seems to be in such a pain trying to push something out! His stools are yellow, soft and frequent though theres little green bits in it most times. I know babies are meant to find it difficult to pass stools but are they meant to be crying and grunting over it constantly?!? I've spoken to the health visitor and all she ever tells me is to keep feeding him everytime he cries (no matter what question I ask) so theres not much point talking to her... I tried getting in contact with the doctor but apparently I need to talk to the health visitor first before and seeing as all I get from her is 'he's fine just feed him everytime he cries'......    He''s contantly in pain and crying all the time! Even when he's sleeping he never sleeps soundly he's always grunting and trying to push something out and wakes up and cries even more... I'm burping him all the time and giving him cooled boiled water, staying away from foods that can give him wind.... nothing seems to have worked. (By the way I breastfeed...) I dont know what else I could try? what could be the problem!!
20090128103157AAPOxT9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Miscarriage question?	(I don't think I am pregnant or anything right now, but just in case I got pregnant unexpectedly)       I drink a lot of caffeine, I work in the food business so really, the only thing I have to drink is pop so I always grab a mountain dew (family owns pizza business.) Someone said on here that if you drink a lot of caffeine while your pregnant, you can miss carry. Which I could totally understand why, but say I didn't know I was pregnant and I was drinking mountain dew still, are my chances of having a miscarriage high? And how high?       Also, I wanted to try to conceive in the next month after this period (I should be starting today or tomorrow.) So, say I stop drinking caffeine completely starting today, what are the chances of me miscarrying if I ended up pregnant in the next month or two?      I'm so scared that something like that bad will happen to me, I don't know what I would do if I actually miscarried.       One more question, if someone miscarried in your family, say your grandma and she was the only person, could it be genetic and that's one of the reasons that it happens or did the baby just have some complications?         Sorry about all my question.            BABY DUST TO ALL. XOXOX   ANDDDDDDD BABY DUST TO ME. XOXOXOXO
20090128100555AAb1nAv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant??? nausea,light bleeding, tender boobs?	Ok so here's my story. In the month of December I missed taking a couple birthcontrol pills. My period came at the midtime of January, but I wouldn't really call it a period because I bled for a day. After that my boobs were super sore...really tender to the touch.  It has been about two weeks since that day I bled. My boobs still hurt and I have been throwing up every morning since yesterday. BUT soemthing else started 2 days ago. I started lightly bleeding. I took a pregnancy test last Saturday, and it was negative. What's up with that. Miscarriage maybe??? I have been pregnant before, and these symptoms are just like the ones I had with my daughter,

20090128100315AAiN8lD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	"What to Expect the First Year" says to give baby a sippy cup at 5 months?	My daughter is 4 months and I was just reading through the "What to Expect the First Year" book to see her development. I was reading a section that says it's a good idea to introduce the sippy cup at 5 months?? That seemed a little off to me considering my baby can't even hold her own bottle yet! I just might try it next month to see how well she takes to it, but if she flat out refuses, then I'll wait until she turns 1 like I had planned to. Did anyone else wean their baby from the bottle at 5 months?

Did you register for sippie cups, spoons, forks, bowls (stuff like that) and a potty seat even though they won't be used right away?

Please don't judge i know this will sound bad but it's just whats on my mind. Ok i have 2 young boys 9mos and 2yrs. anyway the past 4yr been real crazy with the money problems, my bf losting his job and bills and living with a roomate and her 4 kids and i place i hate that just nasty. Anyways i got a chance now to move to Fl. my aunt needs help with her nurseing home. It was looking good expect for the fact that she moves alot and there my only family there and a new problem came up my bf. which brings me to my second problem my bf we just found out he has lupus which his mom died from when they were young. And now there so much going on i want my boys to be around there father as muchas they can. And because his grandpa died he was trying to stay here with his grandma anyways. but because he has no job his grandma wasn't going to take him back in her house anyways. I  just can't get my self together up here i want to go back to school but i need!!! my own place and i can't do both plus i can't find a good job i'm working 2 jobs now and can't take to much more of this. Plus i hate to say this but I'm thinking of is anything does happen to my bf where would that leave me were not married(he says he wants to wait till he has money and were older were 25 now) I didnt do child support because he was helping me and because of his sickness he couldnt keep a job. His grandma his life insurance on him but i really dont think she'll give me any money and i really wouldn't fight her for it cause she been taking care of my bf since he was 6 when has mom pasted so she earned it even though i'm the one paying the monthly cost now cause he's not working i wouldnt feel right.

And what should i do.
20090128120328AAtH2iO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Trying for baby number 2 ?	my hubby & i are TTC baby #2 -- we've been discussing names the last few weeks because when i was pregnant w/ our daughter it took us FOREVER to come up with a name, so this time we hope to have a name picked earlier on in the pregnancy. Problem is my fave boy name is Brayden, but we cant use that because we have a nephew named Brayden, and as for a girl i cant think of anything.       Our daughters name is Kaylee Addison, and if its a girl the middle name will be Denise after my cousin that passed in 2008.       Any advice on boy/girl names?

20090128115301AAlsXEv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	5 month old baby hasn't urinated in 6 hours!?	My daughter has a cold with a cough and congestion.  We took her to the doctor this morning because she isn't eating well and when she does eat, she throws up when she has a coughing fit.  The doctor did a test for whooping cough (results will be back in a few days) and found that she does have an ear infection.  The problem is that she hasn't had a wet diaper since she got up at 7:30am (6 hours ago).  The first feed this morning lasted 10 minutes, then she pulled off.  Ten minutes later she coughed up her feed, but wouldn't eat anymore.  The next hour I was able to get her to take 5 oz from a bottle which she kept down.  Two hours later she took another 5 oz, but vomited up at least half during a coughing fit.  She still hasn't peed.  I've got a call into her doctor, but was wondering how long is it ok to let her go without peeing before she needs IV fluids?  We were just at the doctor 3 hours ago and he didn't say she looked dehydrated.

Why do women think that pregnant women want and need to hear their sad stories such as miscarriages, still births, what sex the still birth baby was, etc?   Seriously, I didn't give a sh!t! I had my son at 26 years old and he was perfectly healthy i mean i was 26 years old and no female problems duh. I found it depressing to hear all these women's sad stories. one girl said she was pregnant with triplets but miscarriaged and she was just a customer that i waited on. I said to her well you should try again. Then she said "but what are the chances of having TRIPLETS again???" I'm thinking oh Jesus F...ing Christ go cry to your best friend but not a pregnant stranger.    What is with that?

I'm a first time stay at home mom of a 6 week old adorable little boy, and for the past 6 weeks, baby and I have been somewhat hibernating at home, getting our routines down. Lately, as expected, he's been much more interested in toys, singing, tummy time and various other things we do everyday during play time, which got me thinking about classes he and I can take together that  foster a comfortable learning environment.           I would like to meet new moms in my area who have children around my sons age so that my son can grow up around other children and learn how to socialize from a young age. I'm not going  to rush into classes right now if he's too young for them, but I'm curious as to what classes you might have gone to with your baby (and at what age), and if you found them fun and beneficial both socially and educationally.        So if you're a mom or dad who took their baby to classes, could you please share your  experience? I've heard of those Gymboree classes too, has anyone done those?
20090128120355AAWBsXE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do I discipline my 5 year old daughter?	She's an angel at school, and as soon as I pick her up, it's like she's a complete different child! It’s as if all her aggressions build up at school all day long, and then she takes it out on me, my husband and 7 yr old daughter. Example, yesterday she sits in the car and asks if we can go to her favorite grocery store to buy ice cream. I said no, and she had an immediate meltdown to the point where she made herself throw up. Then this morning she asks for a $1 for the vending machine at school. She knows the rule where both her and her sister get $1 every Friday for the vending machine. I don’t want her snacking on chips/cookies everyday of the week. She went into a crying fit, and said You are the worst Mommy in the world, I hate you, I hate your rules. Her 7 yr. old sister was trying to calm her down!! She’s very selfish, demanding and aggressive at home. But at school she gets along just great with her teachers, friends, and is very well behaved….What should I do?

She is happy bc she dont have to go through Vaginal delivery. She says it bc her Dr. says bc the first is c-section then second has to be.

20090128112816AAVe7XI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	7 Weeks Pregnant, are we ready?	I am 19, turning 20 in April.  I just found out that I am 7 weeks pregnant.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 1/2 years.  We both live at home with our parents.  We have been planning on finding an apartment for sometime in June-July.  We decided this before the pregnancy.         For the last week we have been trying to decide what to do with the child.  As there are 3 clear options.  We are both young, 20 years old and know that many think we are too young, but when something unexpected happens there is not much you can do about it.  We have mostly come to the conclusion to keep the baby and raise it.  The only worry I have is, are we financially stable?        My boyfriend makes $2000 a month after taxes.  And I make $2200 a month after taxes.  I will be off work and have mat and parental leave for one year where I believe I am qualified for 55% of my wage.        The baby is Due in September and it is end of January right now. We will start saving Feb 1 and hopefully have a place by July 1st.  Living on our own, paying rent, buy groceries, making insurance payments and the day to day costs of living are we financially capable of having a child?      Please correct me about Alberta's mat leave and parental leave if I am wrong.  This is all new to me and I'm trying to figure out our finances while I would be staying at home with the baby for a year, and also what kind of funding I qualify for.        Thanks for your help and any suggestions or advice would be so much appreciated!

THe mafia head, took me and one other guy to break into a house - i cant remember if we were the good guys or the bad ones. But after we finished getting the "evil" guy from the house, i saw a woman, carrying a child and crying helplessly. I went up to her, and she told me she was going to die and didnt know what to do with the child. So i told her, i would take her baby girl. I asked the woman how old the baby was and she answered 1.5 yrs old, but somehow both her and later me, carried her in my arms as if she was just a newborn.      I loved the child as i have loved nothing else. I gave up fighting and became a single working mom. THen i was going to enroll her to school one day, (she is 2 now) and then she buys a cheap chocolate from a shop. I felt so sad because i could buy her the expensive better ones. And i also thought that i wud teach her to go only for the best, if she cant afford the best, then not to go for anything, but to go only for the best ...      surprisingly, i am 15 and i never  felt such love before. I simply loved the girl, and she loved me back, and nothing could have made me happier. Why the f**k did i see the dream though, nothing specific happened in my real life for this to occur!

For the past 2 days ive been having this weird discharge only a couple times a day it kinda looks like boogery but sometimes its more brownish tan sorry TMI its gross! And also for the past week and a half ive had horrible nausea that lasts all day long and i usually have vomiting at night. Well my nausea has lessened, I actually feel good when I wake up ( i still have sore boobs/fatigue/frequent urination) I still vomit at night and have occasional mild nausea during the day. Isnt morning sickness supposed to last like a month? Is it normal for it to become milder the second week? Its almost unnoticable during the day. Im just paranoid about miscarriage!! I know that symptoms that disappear can lead to that. Also today I had a couple weird cramp things in my left lower back that only lasted a second...ive heard that can be a sign of ectopic or miscarriage...any suggestions as to if everything is normal? Thanks ladies

They looked alright but we have so far used 3 of them and 2 of them have leaked. Has anyone else had this problem with them? All the reviews that I read say how great they are. I think im sticking to the Pampers.
20090128122122AAjtNjk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of the names my husband and I chose?	If we have a boy, he will be Connor Loring. (middle name is tradition in his family)      If we have a girl, she will be Ariel Elizabeth.       Yes, we're aware of the Disney princess connection but are in love with the name and feel that a little teasing will build character, anyway. :)
20090128124159AARqbYC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How long after a mis-carry does it take for HCG hormone levels to return to pre-pregnancy levels?	I'm wondering if I've has a Missed Abortion which is the medical term for having a miscarriage w/out expulsion of the fetus & related tissues.  There are NO signs other than a loss of pregnancy symptoms.  I was feeling extremely depressed, tired, bloated, & a little gassy as my pregnancy symptoms but for the last 2 weeks I haven't felt any of those things.  I'll let my midwife know but I haven't actually even hired her yet.  I'm 9 weeks & was wondering if it would show up on a pregnancy test yet if I miscarried.

20090128122310AAXGdcX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Baby names: Siegfried and Skyler?	I am planning on naming my baby Siegfried Michael (+last name) after my dad who died when I was 15. I know Siegfried is not a common name here in the US (it's the old Saga of a dragon slayer) but it could be short Siggi or something.       Girl I am thinking Skyler Hope (+ last name) and since I think the "original" spelling Schuyler is too complicated. That name goes for both boys and girls ....anyway can I get some opinions on those names? Some people said Siegfried will have a hard time in school (poking fun at him etc) but it means so much to me?!?!?!

20090128123637AAHFsbm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	To all the parents out there? how would you bring up this concern with your baby's daycare?	yesterday i went to pick up my toddler from the day care (she is 29 mo). they were playing outside and i noticed she had a scratch mark on her face, close to her nose.. i asked one of the ladies if she knew what had happened... she said, oh, i'm just seeing it now... there were no fights today, maybe she got scratched by a plant or something...    today, i went to pick her up and i noticed another scratch mark (a new one) on her collar bone... i asked if she had gotten in a fight, several of the caregivers were present when i asked, and they all heard my question; i got the same answer: oh, i'm not sure, they said my daughter is usuallyplayingg with the boys and can get in the middle of a fight... when we got home, i was giving her a bath when i noticed two other scratch marks on her left thigh! it's as if someone pushed her nails in but didn't scratch.. you know what i mean? they are both sort of deep nail marks... this shocked me because they are bigger than a child's nail... when i asked my daughter to let me look at it closely, she refused, i called my husband and my daughter panicked, started crying saying NO, No... i showed them to my husband and we are both shocked, we keep asking her who has scratched her, she gives us the name of her close friend.. but for some reason i can't believe it... the one on her face and collar bone are understandable but on her thigh? she must have been without her pants.. and they are not walking around with no pants on, unless when they are gettting changed,... another thing that perplexes me is the size of the nail mark which as i said is quite long..    i'm going to talk to the principal tomorrow.. how would you bring up the subject without putting a blame of any sort on anyone?    what should i say??? has anyone dealt with a similar situation before? help please... i mean, i know all the care givers and they are really sweet, caring and kind... but how could they explain the scratch marks?

20090128130904AAAtA9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	5 month old daughter leg issue?	My 5 month old is very busy trying to crawl right now.  She will push up on all fours and rock back and forth. I am concerned though because she constantly taps her left leg.  She will just lay there on her stomach, holding her head up, and kicking the floor and now that knee seems to be swollen.  She has a small crease in the middle of both knees, and the left one seems to be much deeper.  I was wondering if tapping one leg like that is normal or if I need to be concerned about muscle/bone issues.        I don't know if this helps, but she stands up perfectly fine (she has to have help balancing but she has really strong legs and can stand for a really long time)
20090128130649AAJIlCO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ciprobay and Pregnancy?	My wife was given Ciprobay for a week to treat UTI by her doctor before we knew she was pregnant (probably she was 3 weeks pregnant at that time). She took it for 1 week. Now she is almost 29 weeks pregnant. I have read that this medicine should be avoided during pregnancy. Now I am very afraid ! Could the medicine have had and effect on the fetus? We did the detailed ultrasound at 20 weeks and they didnt tell us there is anything wrong....please be honest !
20090128124754AA2SArF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Poll: Is it low of me to get on Medicaid?	I guess I don't really have a choice if I end up being pregnant. But are there other options available when you don't have insurance?      I work 8 hours a day and so does my husband. If I got on his insurance it's $260 a month! I work for a private mortgage company that does not offer benefits.      We can barely pay our bills as it is, so I'm not sure what else I can do. I just dodn't want to feel like one of those people who abuse the system. I'm not trying to, we just have no money.

20090128123258AAdIBO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm Pregnant and my boyfriend has cold feet?	Our daughter is 4. He was 17 and I was 16 when I got pregnant, it was a stupid of me to get pregnant that young but he stuck by me the whole time. I am now 20 and he is 21 and I am 10 weeks pregnant. It is still young, but he was ok with it the first time?  I told him two weeks after I found out as I wanted to wait a little while in case i lost the baby and at first he seemed great but now he's getting very distant. Whenever I try to talk about it he avoids the question. I've wondered if its because he wants to split up but he is always telling me how much he loves me. I've talked to my mum about it and she tried to reassure me, but obviously that hasn't worked. What the hell is going on?

Me and my baby's daddy have been separated for a year now and we have a 2 year old daughter, who is my pride and joy. Just recently she was taken away from me and I got her back. Well now we are on a temporary parenting plan until we go to court. He has her 4 over nights and I have her 3. My problem is that when I got her back from her dads she started acting up. She is cussing alot saying the F word and the S word, she is pushing and telling me and everyone to go away, the other night she was taking a stuff animal and choking it and hitting it against the wall, to me that is very alarming, she is throwing  temper tantrums, and just starting to be a lil pain in the butt. I don't know what to do to get her back to her sweet normal self, my mom says that i should take her to go see a child psychologist, but i'm not so sure about that. I am in need of help so can anyone give me advice on what i can do?
