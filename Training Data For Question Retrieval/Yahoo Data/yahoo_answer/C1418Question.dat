20090226192810AAgqL0w	Social Science;Psychology	Why does this happen to me?	At my job, a lot of the men come and talk to me. I am young but not that pretty, I am pretty plane jane. Yet all these men come out there and talk to me and sometimes I will have like 5 guys standing around my desk..and the boss walks through and gets onto me! I do not ask these people to talk to me, people just do it! Tomorrow we are having a meeting at work and I am pretty sure it's about how everyone goofs off there or something. I am so worried.      Also, sometimes I will mentino something that I want or need and people will get it for me..like people at work or just people I know and sometimes even people I barely know. I don't say "hey get this for me!" just in conversation I will mention something and it happens.      And also sometimes we have voting contests to vote for the best photo, etc., and the one I vote for people always vote for it too..even if they dont like it they just vote for it bc they say they will if I do????      I really do get stressed out about this..do you think I am putting a needy "do this for me" vibe out there bc I really don't think I am..It's just so odd that stuff like that always happens to me. It's very weird and honestly very worrisome. I don't want anyone to get in trouble for talking to me..this has me worried sick.      What do you think I should work on to get rid of some of that neediness vibe I put out, if that's what I am doing without realizing it???

20090226194238AALlOtH	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream last night and I woke up crying, because of what happened in it..?	what does it mean?      I supposibly went back to the place in Mexico where my mom was born. Right now at that spot there's a lot of police and army going around because of the drug dealers. So, we were there after about 7 years that we hadn't gone. I saw so perfectly. I was at my grandmas house. She went to go get some tortillas from the store. Then, some time passed and she never came back. Then someone told me that she had died. Except, I saw my great grandma in this dream too.. but she passed away like 4 years ago. My great grandma is my grandmas mom. So, turns out my grandma died in my dream. I was crying. I remember sitting in her living room crying and crying and I woke up crying. It was unbelievable.       I know there's a lot of detail in this dream but, they say sometimes the smallest things have the meaning..      Oh and btw, my grandma that died in my dream is alive, but her mom is dead.      It keeps on bothering me because i can kind of predict when someone will die.. you might think im crazy but w/e.. i usually wake up at 1:00 am when someones going to die.. but except i woke up at like 2:20am this time..      help please?

One of the innumerable complaints that modern Feminists seem to have is that there are insufficient numbers of women in government representing them (not that there's anything at all preventing women from running for public office).      Why don't hip hop or rap artists like the brilliant Flavor Flav complain that they don't have adequate representation in government either?      I can't think of a single hip hop artist in a position of political influence.  Why don't they complain like modern Feminists do about this?

20090226201143AAgxaXy	Social Science;Anthropology	I think I am a werewolve!?	Its really creepy. I know it sounds really weird and all but I think it's true. I have all these weird symptoms. One, I always end up like either in a closet or in the living room on full moons, also on full moons I feel really edgy like I need to be doing something. Two, I have really sharp teeth that look just like fangs. Three, I can communicate with dogs, not just saying hi to them but actually barking and understanding them. Four, I can't stop eating meat, I always need to be eating it constantly. I also have really bad temper problems, I always get super mad over little things and try to bite them. When someone messes with me I don't just sit there and get mad I growl and snarl and start shaking insanely. I also have weird mind urges, I can almost tell what people are gonna say, not just knowing them well but even people on the streets I can tell. My drama teacher yells at me a lot so that's when my anger really starts. Please no comments on how crazy I am or I'm a just weird. I am afraid that if I am a werewolve that I will hurt the people I care most about. Any ideas on how to keep it a secret and how to control it?

Anyway I never really talked to him much or did not give him any thought, apart from I actually thought he was a bit of a dick.  Then I started having dreams with him in it, and now even 5 years later when I haven't seen or heard from him for years I still sometimes have dreams with him in them.  The dreams are always different but the theme is that I am either his girlfriend or wife or that I love him.  I am in a relationship and my boyfriend (we have been together 8 years) knows about the dreams.  Does anyone know what this means?

20090226210257AA84GEM	Social Science;Economics	What mathematics should I be focusing on for economics?	I've decided to go back to school after about 10 years. I already have a B.A. in philosophy, but now I want to do a M.A. in economics. The problem is I never really studied advanced math.   The dean said he would be willing to get me into a quick essential course program of economics of one year and right into the master's program as long as I could pass two preliminary math courses.   I'll be taking those classes in September. In the meantime, I want to start picking up math textbooks and get myself up to par.    I would like to know what I should be focusing on in order to maximize my time until then. I have a basic knowledge of algebra. I understand statistics rather well, calculus is new to me and I don't remember much trigonometry.    So basically, what should I be focusing my energies on until september?

20090226211643AAJXEAa	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it true that some people choose not to adopt children because they don't want to deal with...?	the emotional baggage and abandonment issues they might have?      I was having a discussion with a woman today and we got on to the topic of adoption. She stated that newborns are most "in demand" for adoptions. (I could not find a source to back this up, but it's not terribly relevant to the question)      I asked her why.      And she responded that most people don't want to "deal with" all of the emotional issues that a lot of abandoned children have; they would rather have a "fresh start" with a newborn.      I responded, and this is my question to you:      Doesn't the abandoned child especially need a stable and loving family to prevent further emotional damage? Isn't it selfish for people to dismiss this child in favor of an "undamaged" newborn?      Do people really think like this?      Would you see the irony in an abandoned child growing up to become a serial killer and then condemned by a jury of the same people who didn't want to deal with him?

Maybe it is wrong but if I am so sick andmy body aches and I am dying a painful death why can I not ask for help from someone who will be there, beside me to ensure I do "it" right...so I don't make a mistake and cause myself further pain or suffering.    And the biggest question is why are those that want to help not looked at as if they were angels of mercy instead of murderers?       I think there should be a place where we can all go when we are ready to die....a building...we can walk into...lay down on a bed....and breath the same kind of stuff that the drs give us to help us sleep and just sleep until we die.       It is our bodies....should be our choice.      BUT....with evaluations and drs approval......just like what those people who are trying to help others by assisting their death.       I hope and pray the day the time comes for me to die and if I am in pain someone will be there to help me die...in peace and without pain.       Oh and I hope that is many many many years from now...lol      But what do you guys think of assisted suicide?

Last night i had a dream that i was w/ a bunch of friends. We went in this elevator that went all the way down underground like in a cave/mine or something. I think we were in a country in Africa and we saw 2 people (one woman carrying a baby looking helpless and scared). i was shocked by this sight. and one of my friends replied this is how it is. this is how people live. Africa's tough. my friends said look at this carpet! (it was this rolled up oriental rug) this would be great for our place, this is why we're here.      the rug was located in the narrow passageway made of rock. half of it was covered by shadows. so they got the rug.      we turned around to get back on the elevator i was behind the 2 of them and all if a sudden a bat came from the narrow passage and clamped its teeth and curled up into my neck.      IT WAS SO GROSS! i remember trying to get it out. being afraid to touch it and its teeth were in my neck. it tickled and hurt IT FELT SO STRANGE!! it had clamped itself down in was in my "nook" ugh!!!      needless to say my neck is VERY sensitive. its a very sensitive area of my body and needless to say it's my "spot" where boys kiss or talk softly when they want to "get me going". its so sensitive some times i cant even take it when someone talking to me and i can feel their voice vibrations on my neck. its overwhelming!!!      what does this mean, when a vermin or something disgusting is invading a sensitive area of my body??? its reoccurring not every night, but periodically..   THANKS A MILLION!!!

Because of this, foreigners demand more American aggregate output. Will this make the aggregate demand curve move up or down?

BUT when they called my name out from the class infront of my classmates.. i felt somewhat offended because they might think i stole it or something... they even pulled a classmate that would not do such a thing but... should I confront my teacher and say something? and what? I wanted to say, "Mrs. ... Do you really not trust me?"    at this point they dont trust anyone.   It shouldn't be a big deal for me because I didn't do anything... but i don't want teachers to be questioned and concerned about me.

We talk about anything and everything, and he's made comments like he thought I was hot, how he misses me, etc...      He's also the sarcastic type, so I joked with him and said "I think you have a crush on me" and he said "No, I only call you to kill time"      He's a busy guy, with work and school, and I doubt he'd have an hour or two to waste talking on the phone...so, why did he deny having a crush on me when I called him out on it?      Any opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

I really see no point in living, I see it as we're pretty much ******, and if I die I could atleast donate my organs to someone who needs them. I've been seeing a psycologist and now I'm on prozac, none of which are really helping(infact its making me feel worse). Kinda stuck, can't go anywhere, no job, no friends, family that dont really care about me, too shy to make friends or even be social. I start college in a couple months which just seems like a glorified high school, which I had just dropped out of in 9th grade. I'm not a good talker so even if someone was to listen I doubt I could get it out.

( im 17, female)   Thee other day, I was in odd mood, a little down because of something someone had said to me. I was surprised because I really wasnt effected too much by it. So i picked a fight with  my mom (sorta) by telling her to clean something, in a rude way.   she started to yell at me. which for some reason made me feel a little better.( haha yeah i sound crazy) Then, while doing the dishes i started to feel bad for myself, i started crying. I thought of how I felt better after getting yelled at. I felt really sorry for myself   its hard to explain      but this happens too often ( not fighting with my mom , but rather the way my emotions work)      -something will upset me a little, but not too much   itll put me in an bad mood though   and i just break down from soemthing else

20090226213725AAUxPqZ	Social Science;Economics	Health Care Problem (I answered the question, check to see if I am correct!)?	QUESTION:      Required health care is like a government-mandated increase in wages. Consider the market for workers whose employers do not provide health care coverage. Draw a supply and demand diagram for labor, with annual wage or salary on the vertical axis. Show in this diagram how a requirement to provide $4000 of health care for workers implies a downward shift in firms' demand for labor by $4000. What happens to equilibrium wages and labor? What would happen if the wage rate could not adjust downward, say it was because of a minimum wage?         Now apply these ideas to the economy as a whole. What would happen if there was universal coverage for everyone in the US? (Similar to the Canadian system.)         MY ANSWER:      For the graph of the "market for workers whose employers do not provide health care coverage" I draw the standard Supply and Demand graph with the X-Axis labeled "Labor Force" and the Y-Axis labeled "Salary."   I shifted the Demand curve to the left.      This hurts equilibrium wages and labor because the companies have to pay $4,000 for each employee - this takes that $4,000 out of the employees' salaries and hence the workers are paid less.      If the wage rate could not go downward, then companies would take on a financial burden. The size of this financial burden would depend on how large the company is.      If there was universal coverage for everyone in the U.S., there would be two main effects. First, workers wages would go down. True, no one would be without healthcare, but now as a whole, workers in the U.S. would be paid less. Second, companies collectively would take on financial losses. This would hurt America's GDP.

I have to find out if the statement is true, false or uncertain and why. Any help is appreciated, thanks.      1. A decrease in the tax rate causes autonomous expenditures to rise which leads to a rightward shift of the aggregate demand curve.      2. If the price level increases, the real value of household wealth falls. This will result in a downward shift of aggregate expenditures and a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve.      3. The short run aggregate supply curve is likely to have a constant positive slope.      4. When the price level is endogenous, a $10 billion increase in government spending will increase national income by the multiplier times $10 billion.

20090226200402AArrgBs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Three dreams in one night....What do they mean?	In the first dream, I was basically in the forest when suddenly a black wolf comes. The wolf chases me, and I run to a random little house that happens to be my Aunt's. She protects me and lets me escape in an underground tunnel. The wolf kills her.      In the second dream, I was walking down my neighborhood street with a child. I knew we were being followed, and that I had to protect the child. At one point, darkness surrounds us and we are attacked by invisible things. Somehow, I manage to drag both of us out of the darkness and run to the nearest house.      For the third dream, I can't even explain. It gets too complicated, so I'll say this: at one point I am standing on rocks, a river flowing past my ankles. I was dwelling on something, until the water started coming faster, eventually rising to my knees. I knew I had to get out of there before the flow grew stronger.      All three dreams happened in the same night. I woke up for about three seconds between each. What do they mean?

20090225123720AAk1gN5	Social Science;Psychology	Personality, views and so forth... do they contribute to personality disorders?	Good afternoon!      I've been wondering this for quite a while, but after gotten around to answering it until now.      To start off, I'm not a social-butterfly and I am usually isolated from people. I'm very arrogant/egoistic, can be bossy, highly intelligent (given my mood) and am a real smart-butt. I never had much of anything nice to say to anyone, I'm unbelievably sarcastic, I'm a negative person - despite appearing to be laughing and cracking jokes all the time. I also think I'm a sadist.      I GUESS I can be considered an misanthrope (somewhat), I'm a feminist, I don't follow religion and don't believe in a god. However, I am REALLY open minded and believe in most things that people don't. (Ex: Vampires, zombies, afterlife, reincarnation, aliens, spirits...)      I've been told time and time again that I'm: Sadistic, morbid, twisted, disturbed, strange, weird - and just about everything else along those lines. A couple years ago, while I was in elementary - I use to not believe in most of the things I do now, and I definitely wasn't bitter towards people. But, I had some really bad experiences in school that went from bullies to people using me in order to get answers on tests and so on. After that, I've went into homeschooling and I've done a complete 360 of my former personality. Use to be I was rather nice and liked friends, total opposite now.       I have a twisted sense of humor and like things that involve: blood, death, gore, paranormal, occult and things such as those. My degrees of likeness to these things aren't expressed much here because I don't think it's appropriate. I don't approve of senseless violence or war - at least, not the kinds that we know of.      I love nature, the environment and animals. I want to help homeless children, foster children and those who need it, find homes - shelter and food. I want to be someone who discovers the new, biggest discovery that might not be able to be put in a museum. And I want to become a parapsychologist (along with archeologist.)      Despite my negativity, I feel that I am generally a happy person. I live life to the fullest and am eager to finish out school and go to college. I like to read shoujo (girl/romance) manga (japanese comics), and am a serious daydreamer. Along with these, I write fanfiction and play video games (not very often). TV usually only comes out of boredom or before bed, other than that I'm doing something else.       Do any of these personality traits or views contribute to a personality disorder or something else? Any sites provided will be greatly appriecated as well.      Just remember something, these are just scratching depth of my person.

20090225123319AAxuM1R	Social Science;Psychology	Feeling suicidal can anyone help?	know that sounds a bit dramatic but within the last two months my health has rapidly deteriorated. I was taking a hormonal drug for hair loss and came off in late December noticing dramatic side effects. Since then my skin has aged, I have chronic fatigue and panic attacks and worst of all I appear to be permanently impotent, or at least for a very long time going by others' experience. I am 32 and it has come at a bad time as I had just started seeing a lovely woman, my personality has also changed somewhat as I get depression and anxiety and generally feel lifeless.      I read stories of other men and feel quite desperate as there seem to be few recoveries after several years. I don't have many friends or family and have been off work a month. I stay in a bedsit. I've lost interest in music and sport and current afairs, things which used to get me going. I'm just in a panic thinking about the future. I'm my mum's only child and now seem destined not to have a kid. The drug messes around with your hormones and makes you emotional, ages your body and causes great distress.      Does anyone have any good advice?

20090128101418AA1GxeX	Social Science;Psychology	Socially what is wrong with me? ?	i have a great social life, have plenty of friends, go out go to parties talk to girls etc. but when it comes down to meeting new people i fail. seems friends i meet come from a friend via friend basis. for example i will try avoid going to to college cafe unless i know my buddies are there due to fear of failure. when i talk to new people (girls) with no friends around i start to sweat, yet i can talk fine and carry a good converstaion with them. its just i feel myself avoiding huge social areas because of the fear of walking in there and not seeing anyone i know and feeling silly.   what is wrong with me:(?
