As to market turnaround no one knows.

So keep it on the sideline for now. Rumor has it that the us treasury bonds will go up to about 5%, and when that happens the other bonds will go up higher than that, so if you are interested in bonds wait till the US treasury buts a high interest rate on theirs, that is the time to buy one. <br>  <br>  As for cd's i wouldnt because i think they are a waste of time. so keep your money on the side lines for now, adnd thinks will look way good in abour 8 months
tmh42R6Caa	It will not be taken off, but it will be reported as "paid in full".  Even when you pay off or close a credit card it still shows on the report that you had it at one time and under what circumstances it was closed.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	No.  Your credit report is a report of the history of what you did in the past, not just a report on what you still owe.  Even if a bill is paid, it can remain on your credit report for 7 years.|`|CI4SY06baa	You will definately want to start paying off this bill.  You can negotiate with the collector on how they will report the debt once it is paid.  If the debt has gone into collections, once paid, they will probably report it as "Collections/Paid in Full."  Your credit will get better as you pay off the debt and will get even better once you have paid it off.  It will take time to get your credit back to where it was before the negative information was posted on your credit report.....12-18 months possibly.....depends.  Rebuilding credit is a slow process.  People spend a lifetime trying to keep their credit scores on the up and up to be able to take advantage of good deals with future large purchases such as that dream home and that dream car, etc.  Although your credit will improve over time by paying this debt off, it will take even longer for it to go into the "good standing" category.  Try your best not to let this happen again if possible.  You don't want to spend years trying to fix damaged credit.  Good luck!|`|AA11304775	Well, there is still a chance it has not been actually reported on your report.  <br>  <br>  When you get to the point where a collector is calling you, you're probably past 90 days late.  In some cases, just paying off the collector will prevent any negative reports.  In this case, the worst would be a "charge off" which takes up to 7 years to go away.<br>  <br>  If you just have a late payment, most will ignore it after 6 months or so.<br>  <br>  So, what you can do is first pay the bill..if you can and ask for a receipt from the collector showing the dept is paid.  Then you can ask if a report will be made or not.  If yes, you can then approach the doc to see if they'll write you a letter stating it is paid. <br>  <br>  When you have that, use the free credit report option.  Each US citizen is able to get a free copy of your credit report from EACH of the three reporting agencies.  The link is below.  This is NOT one of those scams where you get it for free but end up paying for monitor service.<br>  <br>  When you have that, you can file a dispute and use the receipt and doc as proof the item is paid and requiest it be removed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1OMpG5cPaa	First you must call Mortgage Co to pull you credit <br>  Dont do it your self on a web<br>  If collection is there what MTg  Co can do for you they can negotiate <br>  You might end up 1/4 of what you owned <br>  Than they will ask for a letter from Collection Co and once the letter is received they will remove it from your credit <br>  The credit B will take uo to 34 point every three months from your credit <br>  Please feel free to  call my office <br>  847 -550 -9502 x225

They invest in offices, hotels, residential properties, etc. Many of these are also close to there 52 week lows due to the market and housing crisis.

a33ff33bac6e1aaef10cac76905bbf8aaa	i wanted to be a nurse because i basically wanted to care for those who were sick and wanted a rewarding profession. I was constantly told that it was very hard work and the job was very hard going especially the field i went into which is paediatrics. I was determined to be in this career and have been a nurse for four years so far. The career can be rewarding when you get to see the children get better and go home knowing you had a part in their recovery but can be very stressful at the same time. This is with the lack of resources and sometimes lack of support within the place you work in. As a nurse you are the person the families go to if they are upset or needing someone to fight their corner so you are also being an advocate for the patients you care for and ensuring that the doctors don't get too carried away as you will find that doctors and nurses ultimately have different moral compasses. <br>  I personally would not change being a nurse even with all the highs and lows there are in this job. If you are considering this as a career i would encourage you to go in with your eyes open and speak with people who are in this career face to face and get their experiences as it is definately not like what you see on tv.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	I completely agree with scat. I went to nursing school to help people. My mother died when I was 11 from having "routine surgery" and really incompetent surgeon. I thaught that if I could prevent this in just 1 person I would be able to make a difference. I have always enjoyed  the elderly and helping people. <br>  <br>  Nursing can be a very hard job, depending on where you work. Home Care is less stressful than the hospital, but the paperwork follows you home everyday, and you usually work 5 days a week like normal people, but still work holidays and weekends.  <br>  <br>  Hospital work alows you to leave work at work, well mostly. I had a patient go "bad" yesterday, and he ended up dying last night after I left. Couldnt stop thinking about him last night. Wife was so nice and very emotional yesterday, spent a lot of time with them.  Helping them through these types of experiences is very rewarding. <br>  <br>  If I could change 1 thing it would be lower patient loads. I work at a long term acute care facility with vent patients who are very sick, like the man above, but have 5 or 6 patients on day shift. Too many and cant spend the time with them I would like.

AA11284831	Whether his DL remains valid is up to his state of residence.  Many states automatically extend the validity of a DL while the member remains posted outside of the state.  I've carried an "expired " for over a decade in the past that still remained valid when I was active duty.  Other states require the member to renew just like anyone else, but usually have a mail renewal process for military members who cannot return to the state due to military committments or cost.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, the expired DL may not be accepted as valid ID by many merchants as they would have no way of knowing if it was valid or not.  Police carry a book that outlines state licensing rules and can verify a valid right to operate with the home state pretty quickly but merchants don't have that luxury.  He can almost always use his military ID though.  Most merchants WILL accept that for such purposes of writing checks, etc. but are not required to accept it for the WA & OR reciprocity agreement.<br>  <br>  Two different sets of rules are at work here -- the validity of the license for purposes of operating a motor vehicle and it's validity as proof of OR residence for the tax reciprocity between OR and WA.

And it isn't for people who won't work to become good at it.  "Work" in this context means thousands of hours of learning, practice, and actively searching for weaknesses in your plans, your outcomes, and yourself.<br>  <br>  Why this much work?  Because the guys out here who are taking your money have done this much work and it is the most important reason why they win and you lose.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  stop large losses.  you need a loss stop for each issue and must rigidly enforce it.  properly set loss stops are about 3 times as important as everything else you do.  While loss stops aren't the only element in a money management plan [position size is also critical], if you have large losses because of a poorly designed plan, you'll end up losing.   period.<br>  <br>  No trading plan is perfect for every market and there is some market that will flat kill any trading plan.  you have to make sure that the process you use to detect such toxic markets limits your losses enough that you can recover when you find a winning plan/market combination.<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  this implies that you need to either have a winning plan for each possible market type -- AND the means to detect which is correct for right now -- OR that you limit trading/investing to only those market types for which your plan wins.<br>  <br>  Example:  "dollar cost averaging" and "buy value and hold forever" work fine in long bull markets.  In stagnant markets, they limit your returns to approximately the dividend yield.  In bear markets, they lose.  While they may lose less than other trading plans in a bear market, they also make less than others in bull markets.  WORSE -- at some point the total losses can become so large that you can not recover in any reasonable number of years.  If that happens, your life plans are dead and you need to readjust to a lower [poorer] reality.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.  after this, you can build a trading plan for a specific type of market.  This is a learnable project with learnable methods.<br>  <br>  It is NOT the first task, nor the most important.

RhEhzGbraa	Normally a tree house or any other outside structure which is not attached to the dwelling would be covered under Coverage B Other Structures on a Homeowners Policy Form for 10 to 20% of what the home is covered for under Coverage A Dwelling.  For example if you have your home coverage for $200,000 under Coverage A then you would have $20,000 coverage (or $40,000 depending on the company's form) available to cover a garage, gazebo, shed or in your case a tree house.<br>  <br>  However, if you use the structure to run any type of business or even store business equipment or inventory in it you have automatically voided out all coverage for the other structure (not just the liability as another poster states).  So if you are using the tree house for an office which produces any type of income you will have absolutely no coverage under your homeowners insurance (liability or any other type of peril will not be covered).  You would have to obtain a Commercial Package Policy to provide coverage for the liability, business personal property and the structure itself.  <br>  <br>  Further since you are talking a tree house, it is fairly safe to say that you would probably not find a standard carrier willing to write insurance on that type of structure due to safety concerns.  A substandard or specialty carrier might be willing to do it.  You would need to check with an independent agent that has access to the surplus lines or substandard market to help you with obtaining quotes for this.<br>  <br>  If you are talking home office as in for your own personal needs and not planning on using it to run any type of business (or do any type of commercial activity or storing any type of business producing equipment or inventory), then you would be covered under your homeowners insurance and I am not aware of any type of exclusion under a standard homeowners policy.  Your only concern then would be to make sure that the 10 or 20% extension is enough to cover all (i.e. the treehouse and any other structure such as a shed) of your outside structures.  If it isn't then you can ask your agent to increase it and they will bill you for the additional cost.  <br>  <br>  In terms of your question on property tax--any time you obtain a permit to do construction or remodelling of your home it can trigger an increase in the assessed value of your home which can in turn increase your property taxes.  Of course you always have the option of appealing the assessment and if you are successful holding down your property taxes.<br>  <br>  For any additional information check with your agent or find a local independent agent that can help you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|9k4d7Kytaa	This sounds like a joke, but I'll bite.<br>  <br>  Typically a tree house will be covered under your dwelling extension coverage on your homeowner's policy...which means that it will be covered for 10% of the amount of coverage you have on your home (unless you purchase more coverage).  But your policy may have an exclusion on it for a tree house (they are a liability concern).  You'd have to ask your agent to know for sure.  Also, if you're using it as an office to operate a business out of, you most likely would not have liability coverage extended to your business activities.<br>  <br>  Property tax?

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	It's best to get pre-approved for a loan so that an agent knows you're serious, and not just shopping or being a lookie-loo.  Just be aware that some lenders may say you can afford more than you really can, but you want a pre-approval letter for less so there is negotiating room.  There's no sense in getting one for the biggest amount because then that's all they will show you.|`|AA11173563	pre approved so you know how much you can spend<br>  I am a mortgage banker in TN & KY|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Get preapproved.  All that involves is a lender helping you learn how much you will be allowed to borrow.  Never ever borrow that much. <br>  This way you can tell the realtor what price range you are interested in.<br>  If your top amounts is 200k then do not waste time looking at houses that cost more.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	The other advice is fine: Get prequalified first.<br>  <br>  However, if you have an unusual situation (or even if you don't), there's no harm in going to a Realtor first. Reason: Most Realtors know who the "good" lenders and mortgage brokers are. They know the ones that are most successful at getting loans through, especially in difficult situations. So if you go to a Realtor first, you can explain what your situation is and he/she will probably have a couple of good recommendations for you. You then get preapproved, then return to the Realtor.<br>  <br>  Regarding your follow-up question, the lender or mortgage broker (not the Realtor) would help you know how much you're approved (or would be qualified) for.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Lender first, then Realtor.<br>  <br>  As Acermill likes to say, he can get a ham and cheese sandwich pre-qualified, what you want is to be pre-approved.  This will give you a firm amount that you can spend, good information to have so you are shopping in the correct price range.<br>  <br>  It strengthens your offer to be able to put a sentence in that says you will provide a copy of the pre-approval letter with x number of days after acceptance of the offer. <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend you shop with local lenders.

I'm willing to bet that before you utter the last syllable, he will be fully compliant about the situation; that is IF you have proof that this actually happened. Be calm, cool and collective.<br>  <br>  If you have internet banking, then access your account and print out a history log of all of your recent transactions, especially the incident in question, it will only add to the veracity of your argument. Bring this proof to the branch manager, and see what he has to say.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CPObbqfsaa	Buddy, this is sticky. <br>  <br>  Complain to management at that branch. Explain that one of their employees, usually refered to as "ATM Teller", is unethical and you believe they stole your money. They know the date you made the deposit, so have them review a security tape of where that teller processes deposits for that business day.  If the manager is of no help, escalate the situation to the District Manager. They not only should be able to review the tape at the atm where you made the deposit, but the teller processing the deposits should be on camera as well.<br>  <br>  Give them hell! Dont worry about not having a reciept they acknowledge you made the deposit on that day, the dispute is they don't have "the envelope".

2N6oTOLQaa	The only things you can claim on the car are the sales tax and the portion of the registration fee that is based on the car's value. These only matter if you itemize deductions on schedule A. <br>  <br>  If you itemize then you can deduct the registration (only the portion based on the car's value) for any car regardless of when you bought it. This is considered personal property tax. <br>  <br>  The sales tax deduction is an either-or type thing. You can deduct either your state income taxes or take an estimated deduction for sales tax based on your local sales tax rate. If you live in an area with both types of taxes, you get to choose one or the other, but not both. If you take the sales tax deduction, you can add the sales tax you paid on the car to the estimated amount. <br>  <br>  Those are the only 2 deductions related to your car.<br>  <br>  As far as mileage goes, my guess is that you probably don't qualify for any deductions. If you join the military and are forced to move away from your hometown, you don't get a deduction for traveling back home because it was your choice to join the military. Plus, if you live far away from your work its your choice so you don't get tax deductions for commuting to and from work. The only way you can deduct mileage is if you own a business (or are an independent contractor) or if you are required to use a personal vehicle for business travel, in which case your first and last trips of the day are considered commuting and are not deductible.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The sales tax you paid on the car is deductible on the schedule A, if you itemize and if you itemize sales tax.<br>  <br>  When you say you are military, do you mean reservists?  How often do you have to travel to get to training?<br>  <br>  If you mean you live on base and travel home to visit relatives, that's a personal expense and is NOT deductible.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	sales tax is the only thing you might be able to claim related to a car and that's only if you itemize deductions and have enough to exceed the standard deduction|`|hCqoJ4nTaa	For the future you can try FileLate.com:  <a href="http://www.filelate.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.filelate.com</a>  you will be able to file all you late tax returns here and they will answer all questions you have.

iaugc41aaa	In the UK, where I presume the question was asked, civil servants are those directly employed by a government department.<br>  <br>  They are part of the wider group of "public servants", which includes those employed by NHS trsusts, police authorities, fire authorities, local government, etc.<br>  <br>  And now let's see how many sarcastic answers we get.|`|qBCGH52haa	They do a variety of jobs - security (FBI, police officers), safety (mine inspectors, workplace safety inspectors, firemen), lawyers (attorney general, prosecutors), process stuff (Social Security Admin processes benefits, unemployment officials process UI claims, etc.), <br>  <br>  The list goes on.  If they work for a government, they are a civil servant.|`|eMqa1ehuaa	Police, Firemen, Nurses and MI5 / MI^ are not civil servants but they are public sector employees.

Nurses work for Hospital Trusts. MI5/MI6 is a standalone Government funded organisation. Armed Forces are employed by the MOD but are not civil servants. Civil Servants include those who work for the Department of the Environment, Home Office, Cabinet Office, Ministry of Defence, HM Revenue & Customs, HM Prison Service, HM Court Service, Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries & Foods, Ministry of Defence Police to name a few. They carry out a wide variety of work and within each department there is a wide variety of staff from clerical assistants and call centre staff to policy makers, technicians to Law Enforcement staff in various constabularies, e.g. MOD Police, Customs.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I think it depends on specifically what you say.  If you left a job for a medical emergency, they might be concerned that after they hire you and put forth the effort to train you, etc., that you're apt to quit again.

I am working with the IRS regarding my 2007 refund and when I spoke with them today, the IRS woman asked me if there was any financial hardship going on - was anything going to be shut off, or was eviction a possibility.

d6SntxLwaa	It's a good idea to receive multiple quotes.  When a broker gives you a good faith estimate, you really need to be aware that often times they will under-estimate closing costs to make it more appealing.  You have the option to cease working with a broker up until the deal funds.  <br>  <br>  If you are concerned with credit inquiries, don't give a broker your SS number until you are ready to move forward and lock in the rate.  While your credit score does directly effect the interest rate that you can qualify for, you can provide any new broker with an accurate score, based on the last credit pull.  As for credit score ramifications, so long as you don't have several pulls for an extended period of time, there shouldn't be any lasting affects.|`|MJKAjgrLaa	please note that if the credit is check within the same period it does not affect it too much, but you can consult another broker if you don't trust the one your using.|`|FE4i4T6eaa	I think you're fine in backing out unless you signed a contract stating you'll do business with him.

FhD2wC6laa	Those other responses didn't directly answer the question.<br>  <br>  First, it is correct that paying more than the minimum *won't* affect your score.  What you are trying to accomplish is to keep from being characterized by the CC companies as a struggling payer.  The strategy is to pay the min plus a little while paying down other cards.<br>  <br>  My experience is that paying an extra percent above the min will keep the CC software from identifying you as a "minimum only" payer.  To be safe since some companies are bumping the min from 2.5% to 3%, I suggest you pay 4%.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It doesn't matter what you pay monthly. Only that you pay on time.

That might be something to mention in a voicemail to your former landlord that you'll file a complaint and he'll end up having to give you more.  I'm sorry for the problem, but this is something that ends up having to go through small claims court if he doesn't pay.  <br>  <br>  His excuse doesn't wash because he wrote you a check.

2N6oTOLQaa	If you are buying something as your primary residence then don't look at it like a risk vs reward like you would with an investment. Look at the price and decide if its worth it to you to pay that price for a home to live in. Once you buy something with a fixed rate mortgage, you have reduced your risk because your payments are fixed and fluctuations in the market don't affect you. Your value only matters when you sell. So as long as you plan to live in the house long enough to be confident that the values will go up, you shouldn't worry about short term fluctuations.|`|23SkYEw5aa	real estate is LOCAL, LOCAL, LOCAL.<br>  <br>  National averages up or down don't mean ANYTHING.

Unless you can afford paying two mortgages until the market is good again, don't do it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qBCGH52haa	If you are buying to live in the house, as opposed to investment, there really is no risk.  After all, the only time that value comes into play after you buy is when you go to sell.  Values will eventually start moving back up, the only question is when.  Do not expect 10 to 15% increases in value like we recently had (figure closer to 3 to 5%).  The days of real estate price run-ups are over.

If you do not claim exempt, I believe they should withhold 28% towards federal taxes.  If your taxes are not filed/paid by Jan 31 of the following year and you owe more than $1000, there may be an under withholding penalty (like if you wait until April 15th).  The IRS has small business info about schedules C (or C-EZ) and SE that you likely need to know about and file.<br>  <br>  You also need to see what your state requires for quarterly estimated taxes.

You can deduct some related expenses, such as the sales tax you paid and the mileage you put in if self-employed, or milage for charitable or medical uses.  Neither of those require actually holding title to the car.  You can take depreciation if the car is used in your self-employed business, but that requires being the owner.
ePkiOzPSaa	Correct, you can't get more back than you "pay in".  The idea of a tax return is not the government giving you free money out of nowhere, it is that they will refund money to you that you paid but didn't actually owe.  <br>  <br>  This is why it's better to try to "break even".  It's actually better NOT to get a tax refund at all, because it means that you held onto the money throughout the year, instead of letting the government hold onto it an collect the interest on anything they invested it in.<br>  <br>  Doing writeoffs is not a waste of time.  The point is to bring down the amount you actually OWE, which will, in turn, mean getting more money back (from the money that you paid in).<br>  <br>  Example -<br>  <br>  Over the year, you end up paying $500 in taxes.  You could theoretically receive up to all $500 of that back, but you most likely won't.  Given your situation, let's say that you would normally receive $100 back.  If you keep track of your write-offs, itemize donations, etc., they can take some of that amount off of the amount of taxes that you owe ($400).  Registering that, you could get $200 back from the $500 that you put in. <br>  <br>  Depending on which of those setups you were working with, you might want to change how much you are "withholding" for taxes, in order to try to achieve "no refund".  You could try to only pay the $300 in taxes throughout the year, but then if all your write-offs/deductions didn't come out as you planned, you might end up having to come up with the additional $100 to PAY the IRS for the taxes that you missed, instead of getting a refund.  This can be very inconvenient, since you will have to come up with the money all at once.  A better choice would probably be to hedge your bets, and pay $400 in taxes, that way you would either get nothing back, or $100 if everything worked out.<br>  <br>  Anyways, I hope I didn't go on too long, but the point is, a tax refund is just the government saying that you paid OVER what you were supposed to, in taxes for the year.  They are handing you back money that was always yours, but they surely made a profit on it in interest that you could've made if you had held it in the first place.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	It sounds like  you are confused about how taxes work. What your accountant told you is correct. Since he works for you, you should ask him for a more detailed explanation. One of my rules that I use if someone is going to represent me as a financial adviser, accountant, lawyer, or whatever, is that they have to be able to explain things to me in a way that I understand them. <br>  <br>  Anyway, your accountant sounds perfectly correct. <br>  <br>  Write offs ensure that you do not pay income tax on money that was never profit. For example, lets say your company takes in $500 on a deal. But it cost you $200 to close that deal because you had to buy the product, travel to meet the customer, or whatever other expenses were involved. You made an income of $300, so you should pay income tax on $300. however, your books show $500 coming in, so you need to "write off" the other $200 in expenses or else you'll end up paying taxes on the full $500. <br>  <br>  He is also correct about the refund. Think about what the definition of the word "refund" is. Its getting your own money back if you paid too much. If you go to the store and hand over a $20 bill for a $15 purchase you get a $5 refund. You aren't getting $5 for free, you're simply getting your own money back because you overpaid in the first place. <br>  <br>  A good accountant will make accurate estimates for your quarterly payments so that you have a minimal refund. In the example above, imagine if the store kept the extra $5 and sent you a check for the difference at the end of the year. You'd probably pay with exact change instead, because you don't want to loan your money to the store with no interest. That's the situation with the IRS. If you send them too much money, you'll get a big refund, but its not free money, you are getting your own money back from overpaying. Plus it was like an interest free loan because they kept your money all year. <br>  <br>  There are a few specialized credits (mostly for low income individuals) that can actually result in getting back more than you paid in. Unless you qualify for one or more of those credits, you can't get back more than you paid in. Ask your accountant to explain what "refundable tax credits" are.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	You should be deducting your business expenses from your business income.  For example, if you buy a printer paper for your business, and pay $25 for the case of paper and $1 in sales taxes, you deduct $26 in expenses for your business.<br>  <br>  If you didn't deduct that expense, you would pay taxes on the $26.  <br>  <br>  If you are talking about estimated payments, the only way you can get back more than you paid in is if you had a loss in your business, and used it to amend other year's taxes and reduce those taxes and get a refund.  Otherwise it is just what you put in.|`|45eac989ffaca096a7c1cd2c65881c42aa	If you got all your money back that you paid in plus more, then you wouldn't be paying taxes at all.

This would be a bankrupt corporation but for the billions of dollars poured into it by the federal government. Even at the end of November -2008 it was selling for a $1.15 so if you would have invested your $6,000 then today your investment would be worth $2,557. You would have lost more than half of your investment in less than 3 months.<br>  <br>  Any individual who chooses to invest in any securities should do so with caution.

Yes there are a lot of cheap stocks, but some of those could get wiped out, or lose all their value instantly because of the lack of consumer confidence. Keep anything extra that you might need, and then put money that is extra from that into an investment.

Also the government holds large amounts of its balance sheet and has large amounts of convertible loans propping it up. This means that the shares will get heavily diluted if the government ever exercises them (which they will). That being said, if you feel like taking a gamble - think of the odds as being 120 to one or higher (currently trading at 0.45c per share, was over $60) if it was a horse would you bet on it?<br>  <br>  Current earnings predictions for the stock market shows that it is over valued and will likely fall further, look for the S&P 500 to be trading around 650 and then buy a fund called a SPDR (this stands for standard and poors depositary receipt) which will give likely double your money in the next 2-3 years and pay you dividends.|`|AA10652652	You could try an ETF that covers a foreign government and offers a decent dividend.

You can deduct that amount, up to $300, on the net amount that you have to pay or get back from the federal government. Let's say you owe the IRS $300 and paid $80 in foreign taxes from the dividends. You'll owe the government $220 instead.

However, I know what I'd do! I'd keep at least 10% in a CD, no more than 5 to 10% in a mutual fund that has a good track record (keep in mind that over 80% of them went down last year, only 4% of them went up the last that I knew!), 2.5 to 5% in savings and checking, perhaps another 2.5 to 5% in savings bonds, and the rest I'd spread out to no more than five  to ten different stocks. Right now, stock are low, but if you wait a couple of weeks, I'd dare say that they'll be back down a bit more! We might have a rally in the stock market over the next week or so, but then I think we're headed back down after that. Why? Unemployment is still rising, stocks are below what they were in October when everyone thought the sky was falling. They're near their lows of November and just the lows they hit on Monday.<br>  <br>  Besides unemployment continuing to go up, there are more job losses (technically, they're different though very much the same), most likely there will be at least another bank or two taken over by the Feds, auto sales will probably continue to be down, etc. Oil might be spiking temporarily (just the last couple of days), but it too will probably fall back down again either in March or it will go up further and then go down. I'd give it at least another two to three weeks to see what happens. If the Dow goes up, it will come back down. It went up just the other day, but it's back down now. It will come down again, though I do think it will go up over the next week or so and then come down. I've been right more than once. Too many times for that matter.<br>  <br>  Same thing with gas and oil. Gold too! It's down a bit from it's recent highs, it will probably come back down a bit more then it too will go up, probably past $1,000 an ounce, up to about $1,150 to $1,400. Oil will probably hit $50 to $60 a barrel before summer is over, but then it will be back down a bit and then it'll be going up further. Gas too, just went up, as I had been telling people it would, it's been dropping, but it's going to go back up over the next week or so and it might hit $2.05 to $2.20 a gallon in my area and yours. It's about 1.85 here now. I was hoping we'd see 1.79 a gallon again, even 1.69, but that might not happen until between April and the end of June.<br>  <br>  I think that we're going to bottom out in the market again soon, and go below 6,900 on the Dow, possibly down to 6,200 to 6,700, then we'll have another rally up a few hundred points at the most, then we'll go lower. If this happens, and pay attention to the market, then that's when I'd get in! If you see the Dow down to 5,700 or so, or even 5,400, then yeah, I'd be in. I'm in off and on now, and I'm in on a few stocks, but it's going to be many months before you see any real growth from it!  Energy stocks (ethanol, gas, natural gas, oil, etc.), Utilities, materials, suppliers, they're all most likely headed down further. If we're lucky, we'll see the bottom in April to October. If we're unlucky, we'll see the Dow no higher than 7,700 at the end of the year, 7,200 at Thanksgiving and the bottom might come as late as March of next year. If thats the case, we're in for a long wait on these stocks to come back up.<br>  <br>  I'm deperately looking for stocks I can trade, and I made $100 this week trading. That's still better than what I'd get from a savings account on $600 in a year. In a year from a bank, I'd only get about $12 to $18. I'll find another stock that I'm going to buy again, soon enough, and even if I make $70 to $200, I'm better off than waiting for that kind of return from a bank. But even I and the pros get hit. You can buy them if you wish, and yes, I have about 5 shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and I think they're coming down further (I figured they were on Monday and they've gone lower already) and will go down further still! When they are down further, I'll be back in them myself as well! I'm in a few penny stocks as well! You can always try $100 in each of these if you wish:<br>  <br>  UVSE - Universal Energy<br>  EBOF - Earth Biofuels<br>  AVR - Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings<br>  JNIP - Juniper Group<br>  MDT - Medtronic<br>  SSLR - Sunrise Solar<br>  CLNE - Clean Energy.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that MDT is not a penny stock though. The other are, except for CLNE. If that goes below $5 a share, then it too will technically be a penny stock again. Even if you put $50 in them, you might get lucky with them. If they triple or quadruple in value, and most of them could, you'll make a lot of money. The same thing with Fannie and Freddie too. Being spread out on them though, you get the benefits of more sectors of the economy. Energy, fuels, etc., they're going to go up. Maybe it will take a few months, or up to a year, but they'll be going up. Just wait until 2011. Oil will be back up past $100 a barrel and gas will probably be up past $3 a gallon again. Natural gas will be used to power a few more vehicles and will be used in co-generation more. Solar and wind will both profit from the government plans also over the next year or two.<br>  <br>  I just want you to remember that this is what I'd do or have done, and what I'll continue to do. For now, and especially in the months ahead, when the Dow is down further, it'll be a good time to invest. By the end of 2010 or into 2011, we'll see the Dow above 9,000, possibly even up past 10,000 if we're lucky. I thought we'd see it this year, but I can see that's not going to happen. Not with 8.2 to 9% unemployment coming, and that's not even the true numbers. The true numbers are actually higher than that and will be higher still. They don't include the homeless any longer when counting unemployment and many of them want jobs; but just like others, they can't find the work.

1Bto3sZeaa	Yes, they'd easily be able to 'find out' you worked there.  Btw, it's ILLEGAL for a former employer to say anything 'disparaging' about you... EOE laws prohibit this.  Sure, they can say things truthful (not opinionated) like, "Yes, so and so worked here on said dates."  Also, the asker of the questions has rules/laws to follow.  Like, they cannot ask personal questions about you at all.  They can only ask general things such as dates of employment, etc.  They aren't obligated to say anything good on your behalf, but if they say something considered 'bad/against you', you can sue them.  Take that into consideration... and they do too... so most likely they would only have 'good' things to say about you.  EOE laws... you may want to look them up.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Just tell them you worked there. There is very little they can say or ask.

LPN is a licensed practical nurse, meaning the person has been through schooling to be allowed to sit for the NLCEX-LPN exam or boards as most call it. LPN programs are approx 1 year in length and they typically work in nursing homes, home care and occasionally the hospital or dr office. LPNs can do most patient care procedures in most states, they do have restrictions on hanging blood products or giving meds IV push.(mo law)<br>  <br>  If your interested I would take a CNA course and try it.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that.

AA11616170	If you were a regular saver, approval would be quicker .  Also, they could see how much you can pay without hardship, and they often work their repayment amounts around what you can afford.  <br>  €300 a month is about €75 a week.  Could you start saving that with them now, every single week?  After 4 or 5 weeks, ask about applying for €1800.  Each credit union makes its own rules.  Some may accept the loan application then, and others may require you to save with them for longer first.<br>  <br>  My credit union will only let you take out shares in excess of the loan balance, so I suggest you hold onto the lump sum and apply for the balance, €1800.   The application process entails filling in a form which will be considered at a meeting of the directors, and a decision of approval or not made.  They usually meet weekly, so if you knew which day, you could ask next day about the decision.<br>  <br>  You can realistically save €300 per month.  That is without any undue hardship.  6 months = €1800.  If you really pulled out all the stops and cut down unnecessary spending to zero, you could save the same figure in a lot less - say 4 months.  So if you don't get the approval (or are required to wait longer before you apply), you can still get that car under your own steam.  And have no repayments or interest to worry about.<br>  <br>  And I expect you are aged 18 or over.  Can't take out a loan otherwise.<br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|ARAYm7BLaa	As you haven't saved with the union they wont lend to you...they need a record of your saving for 12 weeks before they lend...also they only lend up to 3 times what you've saved...in the firrst year, so,try getting a loan somewhere else.

You didn't pay it when it was due, so it does not matter if you pay it off now, it is still not in good standing.<br>  <br>  What they will do is mark it as paid and that is all.

And remember, night shifts at almost any company always pay more so if you work a job like that and have no problems in working late night do a third shift and your paycheck will be higher.  <br>  <br>  You should really try out at least some certification or college program if you are really motivated you will be fine, regardless of money.  You can go to community college and any c.c. will offer a score of certificate programs.  College opens the world to you.  Give it a shot!  I did and it changed my life! (for the better!)<br>  <br>  Good luck! : )

I believe you signed what is known as a non-binding agreement which states that the company let you go for cause. Did you actually read this letter before you signed it?<br>  <br>    It sounds crazy but many companies are doing this now so they don't get stuck with unemployment insurance. It's unethical as heck but is definitly happening. <br>  <br>    If you do get denied you will be offered an option for a hearing. I would take this option and plead your case. If you win you will get back umemployment pay for the last few months.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
05ueWetraa	In the United States, a tax refund is the result of having taxes withheld on earnings that amount to more than a person owes in income taxes for a calendar year. Federal and state taxes are withheld at a specified amount each pay period, and when the year ends, each tax payer must file income taxes by submitting the proper filing forms. In many cases, people have paid more than they were required to pay. When the federal government or state treasurer receives the tax forms, they issue checks for overpayment. This is a tax refund.<br>  <br>  Some people view a tax refundrefundrefund as forced savings, while others consider a tax refund to be money they allowed the government to borrow interest-free. Those who wish to receive a large tax refund each filing year may purposely have their withholdings set higher than necessary. This increases the amount of money they get back on their tax refundrefundrefund. However, many people mistakenly view their tax refund as free money, forgetting that it was money they earned in the first place. Unless aaa large tax refund is treated as savings or is invested, it is often better to receive your money each pay period rather than in a lump sum at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  Those who view a tax refund as an interest-free loan to the government take time to do careful tax preparation and planning each year to avoid paying more in taxes each pay period than they have to pay. Tax preparation involves estimating your eligible deductions and credits each year to get an approximate tax total. <br>  <br>  In some situations, tax planning and preparation is complex, while in other situations it is simple. Computerized taxtaxtax preparation software used to prepare a tax return prompts users with questions to help prepare for the following tax year. While this software can be useful to some, many require the assistance of a professional service. For people with interest income, self-employment income, or other unique situations, consulting with a tax professional can also increase your tax refund for the filing year. Fees for services will range with the complexity of your tax situation, but the more complex the situation, the better off you will be in the hands of aaa professional who is familiar with all current tax laws.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	To your first question, "Why do we have to file<br>  our taxes?", the answer is you do not have to,<br>  unless you volunteer to file.<br>  <br>  Paying taxes is by voluntary assessment.  There<br>  is not a single law that says anyone has to file<br>  taxes.  However, once one signs their name,<br>  under penalty of perjury, one has volunteered<br>  to become a Taxpayer, and is subject to Title 26.<br>  <br>  A W-4, or similar form, is a legally binding<br>  contract, and that is why the IRS insists on a<br>  signed returned.<br>  <br>  The refund question has been addressed.

So basically you must spend what is on it. <br>  <br>  You can go to your bank and test it out though.

And it's permissible to go year-to-year with money in the bank!<br>  <br>  What's not allowed with a not-for-profit is the distribution of the profits to owners, shareholders, or members -- in amounts greater than their contribution.<br>  <br>  There are certain accounting rules about what's acceptable for a not-for-profit to have in the bank, but in general it's not true to say that they don't have anything.<br>  <br>  A cooperative is a special kind of organization where the "owners" contribute to the organization.  For example, if the organization needs $1000, then each member will be asked to contribute their share.  This money can then go to fund the organization's mission, including operating expenses.  What the money cannot go to, however, is to create profit that is returned to the owners.<br>  <br>  Let's take an example: a grocery store.<br>  <br>  A for-profit grocery seeks to charge customers an amount greater than what it cost to buy the food and run the store.

And it can be more if the money is used to make adjustments in the operating budget (e.g., to purchase another store).<br>  <br>  A cooperative would ask that each member contribute money and/or time to running the store.

Possibly more- check your lease.|`|23SkYEw5aa	yes.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Prior to March 1, your landlord should send you a letter asking whether you intend on renewing your lease. At that time, they may say that they will be raising your rent. Still, they will want to know whether you will be in a lease situation or month-to-month (when a lease expires and it's not renewed, it automatically defaults to a month-to-month). <br>  <br>  If your landlord is okay with a month-to-month arrangement, you keep paying your rent. Unless they raise it, in which case they must give you a 30-day notice for an increase less than 10%, or 60-day notice for greater than 10% increase. They can also issue an eviction notice at any time that gives you 30 days to vacate the premises. And, you have the right to give them a 30-day notice to vacate.<br>  <br>  If you don't hear anything from your landlord by March 1, contact him/her to find out what they intend on doing. But, they must give you a 30-day notice to vacate, if that's their intention.

Obviously, you can make a bunch of "free" money if your investments pan out.|`|AA11173563	they get a loan on stocks they already own and use that money to buy additional shares of something. That is the benefit. The danger is if the stocks on which the loan was secured drops in value they get a call to deposit funds asap with in 3 days. If you do not have the cash then they sell off what you do own to satisfy the margin. So they must sell more shares of what you have a loan against at a loss and thus you loose in the long run as the value may go back up the next day|`|ymqWa8GNaa	Because in a margin account you can use the same money - again and again - during the day, AND, you don't have to wait for the money to recycle 3 days (as with non-margin accounts) to reinvest it, after taking it out of a stock.<br>  <br>  Having a margin account does not mean that you have to USE the margin.  <br>  <br>  Let's say you start a margin account with $30,000.  25K is the minimum, so you'll want at least a little cushion.<br>  <br>  You'll have the right to use more than your 30K, up to 60K (2 to 1 margin) depending on your credit agreement with the broker.  If you only trade with the $30,000, you'll be able to repeatedly use the money for multiple trades of your choosing.  And, if you have to sell out of a position that's starting to decline on you, you'll be able to get right back in the market when you want.  This is great for momentum traders.<br>  <br>  As long as you don't use margin accounts overnight, there is no interest charged. If you invest in positions overnight, there is an interest rate charged. <br>  <br>  A lot of people don't understand that having a "margin account" does not mean that you're actually using margin. You don't ever have to use more money than you have in the account.  You can if you want to, but if you're not a seasoned trader, I do not advise it.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to trade effectively, attend a training class at the Online Trading Academy.|`|BdE5niY3aa	1. because it needs less capital.<br>  2. benefit: less capital; danger: can lose more than the capital.|`|M8w6moDeaa	About Buying on Margin can be read in <a href="http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=Buying%20on%20Margin" rel="nofollow">http://usa-people-blog.blogspot.com/?q=B...</a>

Of course your answer will be negative... no.  Then, given that he/she already left you a message/callback #, that is a GREAT SIGN!  Most definitely, you've got the job!  Congrats!!!  They never leave a callback # if they aren't expecting to hire you.  Unless you left out some answers or something odd is placed on the app they need clarification of.  So, IMHO, your foot is already in the door.<br>  <br>  Just answer any remaining questions honestly, to the best of your ability.  Relax, stay calm.  You already have the job, think of it that way.  Everything else is just icing on the cake.  Congrats!  I wish you luck in the future.|`|jNx9tVxqaa	Just relax and ring. The longer you leave it the harder it will be.

If he is not decent he is not worth working for.
aifDtz1Naa	They may mail you a T4, but it is unlikely.  If you don't receive anything call CRA and ask about what "slips you have on file".  If they submitted a T4, but did not send one to you they (CRA) will be able to give you the numbers you need.  I would not count on this.  If they went out of biz, I doubt that they took care of the T4s.  Did you keep your cheque stubs?  Some have year to date totals.  Although it is not a T4, it will give you a pretty good idea of what you made and paid in tax. You are expected to report all income, regardless if you have received a slip or not.  You will never be penalized for reporting as long as you try to be accurate.  When in doubt call the Canada Revenue Agency.  They are very helpful and will advise you on how to proceed.<br>  Hope this info helps!

And I disagree with the comment before me. Finding a job its very had in this economy. I have been looking for a job for the last 2 months, I been putting applications for pretty much everything and I still can't get a call. And there is not too much left to apply for. If you had a job recently and lost it, you should be able to collect unemployment to get by while you find something better, If you did not have one recently, you could sell some of your stuff in craigslist since its free to post. And if you dont have much stuff to sell, I guess you can clean houses or cut peoples grass, but I think even that its hard to find, since not to many people can afford that anymore. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

1Bto3sZeaa	Well, for future job reference, you may want to leave that job out.  Other employers (unfortunately, but obviously) don't look favorably on the 'adult/sex industry', especially lots of uptight female employers.  Heck, even some uptight male employers.  I'd think twice if I were you, and like you said, you could always get a job at a 'normal' place instead.  You may want to consider doing that.  Most likely it won't be your lifelong carreer, so the next job you get, you don't want to have to write on the app that you worked for "The Mega Sex Emporium - We Specialize in Dildos!"  Most likely, you won't get the job... they'll question your integrity taking such a position in the past.  <br>  <br>  Take care, and I wish you luck job hunting!|`|O0JZzJ6caa	About sex shop can be read in <a href="http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=sex%20shop" rel="nofollow">http://yahoo-finance-st.blogspot.com/?q=...</a>|`|ExaerfDraa	In this economy, you take any job you can get.|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	You are not breaking the law. If your folks are not paying your rent why should they care? As for future employment there is very little they can say or ask and if you feel this will harm your chances do not tell them.|`|N4xd99Qaaa	In my opinion there is nothing to be ashamed of to work at an adult shop. It is a job after all and some people are proud not to even have that. Look at it as what it is, it is a Retail Shop. You supply and sell goods to people who have a demand for it. Even with the internet taking a big hit on the adult entertainment industry it is still in the billions of revenue. It shouldn't look weird on your resume because when you put 'Big Bob's XXX Shop of Love' as previous place of employment you also put down that you worked retail, inventory, cashier, shipping/receiving and anything else they do as a business which what another employer in retail would be interested in, is the experience you have to offer. Your parents will find out if they or any of their friends who know you are customers of the place. Basically just tell them up front that you applied for the job and if they have any concerns or questions that you will be happy to answer them. If you can not be proud of your place of employment then why work there at all?

AA11616170	In a lot of places (especially if union-run) it is last in first out, which seems unfair if that means the better employee gets the boot while someone less dedicated is retained purely on chronological grounds.  In an ideal world, there would be the ideal job to suit every person's talents, but we are in very strange times now, and while I don't wish redundancy on anyone, it is simply a shame that the better person may be let go in favour of someone less suitable.
AA11966821	You must be legally an adult, i.e. over 18.  But that is only the start of the requirements to obtain a loan.  Your income is too low to qualify for any loan.  Being in an apprenticeship, you do not yet have a track record on the job, employer references, etc.  How long have you had your accounts at the bank, and do you have both checking and savings?  How much have you saved up so far?  How much do you want to borrow?  What credit references do you have?  A credit card, car loan, etc, that you have had for at least one to two years and paid on time consistently?<br>  <br>  In short, it would appear that you do not meet so much as one single requirement of the many requirements to be eligible to apply for a loan.

AweC7pHgaa	You have to spend about 5 or 6 years repairing your credit report back up overtime before places will give you loans.. When you declare bankruptcy your chances of getting any money loans or credit cards pretty much drops to 1% untill you spend 5 or 6 years biulding up a good positive number credit history before companies will look beyond your past bankruptcy... thats a pretty long time if you ask me.. If i was you i would look for some help from an official dept help program, some program that will help you get out of dept and bad credit and help you get back on your feet.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Bankruptcy is a way to get out of your responsibilities and making them everyone's problem.|`|kifwyOgKaa	It should be the very last, rock bottom choice.
RZzMse3Haa	Well if the lease specifically states "any police activity" then it would technically be legal. Not fair and not right but legal.  <br>  <br>  This is not a standard clause.  Landlords usually only evict if the tenant is the one that got the police called on them and not usually for a one time occurrence. Landlords don't usually evict for that unless they have been called a lot. <br>  <br>  I definitely agree with you that he left something out.  I guessing there had been a lot of fights and calls before this incident.|`|0rpS2b97aa	It doesn't sound so strange when you think that the apartment complex has their reputation to consider.  If they are trying to portray a family environment, you would definitely try to limit the need for police activity there.  It really is going to depend on the lease that he signed.  It is very possible.  I say kudos to the apartment complex for thinking ahead.|`|AA11352641	It says "police activity" not "conviction". He signed the lease, so he's bound to those rules.

He may be the "victim" of this crime, but it most likely was not an accidental crime, therefore he put himself in this situation and now has to deal with the consequences.<br>  <br>  Based on what you say, I would NOT be loaning any money to him, sorry to say but this may be a gamble if you do.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	If your Uncle has a month to month lease, the landlord can ask him to leave at any time with 30 days notice. If he has a yearly lease, he would need to breech the lease to be evicted, but "any police activity" means exactly that. Your Uncle invited this person over, causing the situation.|`|hBW9vnB0aa	The apartment complex doesn't want a law suit if anything else occurs|`|kifwyOgKaa	It's clearly stated on the lease.<br>  <br>  Your uncle should have kept his cool and not allowed an arugument to errupt.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	No, if your uncle didn't live there that "friend" wouldn't of caused a raucous.

Well, I can guarantee you I did file and I qualified for the free e-file.<br>  Anyway, it should be under the "Main Menu" tab.

rLxYw2v3aa	This is how business usually works.<br>  <br>  The ceo was allowed such a huge raise in pay because the shareholders allowed it... And the 1800 workers who were laid off could not manufacture the goods for cheaper then they could in China.<br>  <br>  The shareholders would allow this to happen in order to save costs, and would be more then happy to pay the CEO a bonus for this strategic money saving maneuver. <br>  <br>  As a shareholder in the company, you just saw your cost of doing business shrink by who knows how much, probably 80%. So if you sold surf TShirts for $20, and it costs $5 to make, and Now with this change, you still sell them for $20, but it costs $1 to make...<br>  <br>  If the company popularity drops and the company fails, the executives don't care because they already got their money.

AA10464818	No. The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.<br>  <br>  Even if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.<br>  <br>  Note though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|0yqQg9CXaa	No such thing.<br>  Most of these fake grant sites are really loan sites.<br>  Most will want an upfront fee for processing ( a few hundred dollars).<br>  I've heard they decline you for the grant (loan), and they keep your money.<br>  /|`|AA11966821	If you pay for the info on government grants and actually read it, you will discover that you do not qualify for any of them.  Yes, there are various government grants, but almost all of them go to non-profit organizations: charities, research institutes, institutions of higher learning, etc.  They do not go to individuals.  Also, different grants come from various government departments and agencies and there are different requirements, application process and deadlines for each one.  And any proposed use of the money must be in line with grant issuer's requirements and will be audited to ensure compliance with the regulations.  In short, someone tells you how you can spend it and checks up on you.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as what you want.  The govt (i.e. other taxpayers) are not going to give you a cent.  You will have to earn the money & save up, same as everyone else.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	You DON'T 'sign up' for grants.  You APPLY for them and they are NOT free.

I-bonds are better (because they also factor in inflation), but both are about the preservation of wealth and not the gaining of wealth.  There are two negatives that you have to struggle against to make an investment.  You have to subtract inflation and taxes from your gaines.  If that amount is still a positive then it's an investment.  If the amount is a negative, it's a loss of worth.  I've heard the magic number being 7%, but that was a few years ago.

But even with that data, unless you know which companies are part of the same group, you can get some very misleading answers. <br>  <br>  If you want to know the market share for a particular company, you could get close(ish) by downloading the whole market data from the ABI website, going to the company website and taking their premium figure as a % of the market whole.

Not on paying things off. If you want to boost your credit use your card to buy stuff such as gum (just a few bucks on the card), go home and immediately pay it off. Therefore you have no more towards your debt to income and you are boosting your credit by paying it off on time.
oTSB5BITaa	No. You have to be on the property deed and/or mortgage to claim mortgage interest and property taxes. The fact you live in the house makes no difference. The IRS would define the money you pay as rent, which you cannot deduct.|`|AA11284831	No, you can not.  The owner cannot give you permission to do so either.<br>  <br>  To claim the deductions you must be legally obligated to make the payments.  Since you are not the owner you are not legally obligated for the payments so you cannot deduct the interest or taxes.  <br>  <br>  If you are living in the home then you are a tenant and the owner is your landlord.  He must claim the income and can deduct any rental expenses against that income.  If you are paying fair market rent then he can deduct costs that exceed the income.  The fact that you are mailing payments to his mortgage company does not change the fact that you are paying rent.

Other than calling the doc (obvious) what are you going to do?<br>  <br>  A patient is in severe pain and requesting some morphine. The doc has written an order for it.  What sort of things do you look at before giving the morphine?<br>  <br>  A diabetic asks you what's the big deal about controlling my blood pressure? He says "I don't have any symptoms, so why bother taking a pill for something that doesn't bother me?".  what do you say?<br>  <br>  A patient has put out 20 mL of urine in one hour?  Is this good? If so why, if not why not?<br>  <br>  You are working on the telemetry floor.  One of your patients has a prolonged QRS complex.  What are they at risk for?<br>  <br>  A nurse is caring for a client with colon cancer.  The client has a new colostomy.  What are 3 appropriate nursing diagnoses for this client.<br>  What are some specific areas of ostomy care that should be addressed in this situation?<br>  <br>  A nurse is caring for a client admitted tot he hospital with respiratory difficulty after being diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis approximately one year ago... what equipment should the nurse have at the clients bedside?<br>  <br>  That's just a teeny weeny sample of things you should know.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg!  Don't forget about the skills...how to insert an IV, how to properly give an IM injection, how to change a dressing while maintaining a sterile field, how to prevent skin breakdown, how to pack a wound, how to insert a foley catheter, how to suctions and care for a tracheostomy etc. etc. etc.<br>  And don't forget dealing with egomaniac doctors, impatient families, worried parents, colleagues who think they know everything and patients who refuse care.<br>  And the wide array of body fluids... poop, pee, vomit, blood, pus, drainage, etc.<br>  And the physical labor of  trying to get a 200 lb. patient to the bathroom...<br>  And covering the doctor's a** when they prescribe amoxicillan for someone with a penicillan allergy...<br>  <br>  Seriously, nursing is an extremely hard job!!! You have to have an immense knowledge, not only of disease, but how disease affects a person emotional, physically, and socially.  You have to understand medications, what they're for, why each patient is getting that med, and what the possible side effects are.  You have to have the technical skills for procedures, and the social skills to deal with patients from all walks of life, as well as their families.  It takes a lot to be a good nurse!   But, don't let it deter you if that's what you want to do!  Even though it's one of the hardest jobs, I can't think of ANYTHING else I'd ever want to do.  I love the challenges, the constant learning (even when you're done with school) and doing what I can to meet a person's needs.|`|SOveWKxkaa	Take the the most disgusting thing or movie that you have ever seen and multiply that by reality then multiply that by emotion, then add emergency and composure.

And you have to remain calm and keep a straight face and treat the patient, you also have to deal with sick angry people who are being very difficult. It is a very demanding job if you make a mistake you can kill someone, you have to take care of several patients at once and remember each patients orders. It is a very demanding job.

You end up dehydrated and exhausted by the end of your shift.<br>  <br>  Nurses have to be able to think on thier feet and make decisions and assessments in a matter of seconds. IF you screw up, somebody can die!!!! It is a HUGE responsibility to be a nurse. <br>  <br>  Best thing I would say to compare the physical stress to is imagine walking, bending, stooping, pulling on patients, and heavy lifting for 12 hours with very few chances to sit down, except to chart which is also done standing at times. It is kind of like moving yourself with no help and no rest breaks.

BoAEgaAGaa	First congratulations on your marriage.  As for taxes, the way you claim for withholding does not have to be the same as you are filing your income tax return.  Actually by you each filing as single and 0 all year this means you had more income tax withheld, which could mean you will receive more of a refund.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion would be that when preparing your income tax return do a comparison of married filing jointly as opposed to married filing separately.  If you live in a taxing state, do the state returns also.  When you compare the bottom lines each way, decide which will net you the best tax return.  You are allowed to file either way in any year .<br>  <br>  One more thing is when you do see where you stand after completing the 2008 tax return, you could decide if you want to change your withholding with your employers.  If you see you had more withheld than necessary you could change to married and possibly 1 exemption.  There is a worksheet that goes along with the W-4 to help you decide.  Also if one of you has a lesser income than the other, it is often best for the lesser income taxpayer to stay at single and zero.  This is because when this income is added to the higher income it tends to become taxed at a higher rate. <br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Laura H – H&R Block – Senior Tax Advisor 5 <br>  **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You can do whatever you want on your withholdings - - it does not have to reflect your actual "correct" status & exemptions.<br>  <br>  You are fine.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The W-2 form is what your employer gives you at the end of the year to show how much  you made and how much taxes they withheld. <br>  <br>  The W-4 form is what you give your employer when you start working so they know how much to withhold. <br>  <br>  Claiming 0 is almost always a safe bet and usually will result in a refund. If you have multiple jobs it can cause some problems though. Your company will assume that the first dollars you make aren't taxable because of standard deductions and personal exemptions. Then the next dollars are taxed at the lowest tax rate. However if you begin stacking income from 2 jobs, and both employers assume that those dollars are either tax free, or in a low tax bracket, then you can end up owing money. <br>  <br>  I would say the best thing to do now is file your taxes and see where you're at. If you owe money, then turn in a new W-4 to your employers asking them to withhold an extra amount from each check. If you are getting a huge refund, then consider increasing your allowances so they take less out of each paycheck. When you get a refund, you aren't getting some magical bonus, you are getting money back that was yours in the first place and the IRS doesn't pay you interest. Its better to get bigger paychecks all year than to get a big tax refund at the end of the year.

I met my partner and after being together for two years decided to buy a house together i had enough money to put down as a deposit for a house. Saving for a rainny day deffanatly a good idea.<br>  Hope you recover soon|`|9j4wmpOeaa	isa is probably your saftest bet, good rates of interest, but if u want to have easy acces to use it n the near future then a savings account will be of most use to you|`|MkDypslnaa	i would save it and keep building the savings so whenever u need money u have some waiting for you|`|z1UXptEmaa	give it to me|`|NvA1Ksrdaa	well, personally i would spend it on something nice, or somthing that you really want, you know, whatever you feel like. i suppose it depends on how much you got. either that or you could give some to charity and help someone less well of that you. that would be really nice. or you could simply save it. althoug i'd be a bit weary of the banks if i were you.<br>  hope the crash didn't do too much damage.<br>  <br>  :D<br>  have a nice day|`|4Jy8Hioiaa	It depends on how much you got and what your future plans are. Just off the top of my head I would say to do the following:<br>  <br>  1. Pay off debts<br>  <br>  2. Have an emergency fund of $1000. I assume since your 16 you are thinking about a shiny new car. Don't do it. Go buy a beater and pay cash.<br>  <br>  3. Are you planning on going to college? I would use the money for that. Do not take out student loans for school. They will be an anchor around your neck for a very long time. <br>  <br>  4. You can set some aside for savings.<br>  <br>  I am always a big fan of not going into debt for anything with the possible exception of a house on a 15 yr. mortgage. There are a couple of books you may want to read on investing. One is The millionaire next door. I do not know the author. The other is The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey. These will help you get a handle on how money really works. I assume you are not that familiar with the financial world, being only 16. Go and get books on investing to learn more about different investment types. I know it sounds weird, but I am a big fan of the "xxxxx for Idiots" books. They break things down into simple, understandable terms that anyone can understand. While you are learning, you might just want to park the cash in CD's for now. While it is there, do all you can to learn about the investment world. It will still be growing and once you feel ready, you can move it to whatever you and your financial advisor thinks is best.Hope this helps. If you invest now and follow a life of good financial practices, you will have a retirement that is better than you can possibly imagine. Good Luck.

lLm5uIuDaa	We have used real estate agents to help us find rental properties each time we have had to move to a new State and have never been charged.  The property agents may pay them for the referral.  We have also then used the same agent to find our new home so in the end they get paid by us.  When you are new to an area, it's best to have a local direct you to the best location for you.  Websites don't talk to the quality of the area the rental is in.  That is too big a risk.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	I don't know what country you live in but in Australia real estates do not charge a tenant for helping them find a rental. The landlord of the rentals are charged a fee for the services the real estate provides. The real estates job is to keep tenants in all their rentals otherwise the landlord will change to a real estate that will. You will have to pay a bond of 4 weeks rent which you get back when you move providing no damage has been done to the property. you will also have to pay your rent 2 weeks in advance.

If there is no signed paper work with the different address on it then you are in the right.

You have rights and there are people out there to stop this crap from happening. If you need help to find who to go to, call your local court house and they will have the info on the best people to contact.

HBV9GGXDaa	Join the club.  This happened to me in 2001.  Yes, there is unemployment in some states for this.  Your local state website will have this in their on-line unemployment area.<br>  <br>  You will submit your unemployment request twice monthly, the same way as if you were completely unemployed.  The difference is that you will also enter in the amount of income you received during that period.  Again, this is a state by state thing.  California has this and so does NY....I think the threashold is $72k.<br>  <br>  The fact that you are making under $30k a year qualifies you for some kinds of assistance with both the State and Feds.

Join the thousands of other folks that are in the same situation.  The unemployment pay here in GA is only 340 week, which  is like minimum wage, but if you make more than than what the weekly unemployment rate is here in GA, they will not subsidize the difference. Your only option would be to find a second job.  I think you even make too much money to qualify for food stamps which is really sad because they make it difficult for middle class people.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Call your unemployment office.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what the cap is on income--your old job may have paid XX in benefits and if that was more than the $14K job, then you *might* get the difference.|`|Hx88UGlpaa	Joey, you can contact the unemployment office, but, they will pay you the max if you are not working full time. I don't believe they will pay the difference in income, that's basically up to you to find a job comparable to what you were getting paid. Unfortunately, happened to my hubby too, and income has decreased as well. A lot of companies are getting rid of the "money" makers to hire people for less money in this economy. It's really stinks, but...that's mainly what is happening with most companies. Unemployment may have a lead to a job that would get you close to the amount of money you were making. Good Luck!
yO5tm6e1aa	When one gets to the IT Consultant and IT Manager levels, it's not a matter of who earns more money.  Decades in the IT field, their location and associated costs of living, and their experience will dictate salary.  It is possible for the IT Consultant to make more than the IT Manager, though it's a little more likely the IT Manager will make more than the IT Consultant.<br>  <br>  IT Manager:  Directs Information Technology projects (or a team of IT Consultants and Analysts running multiple projects).  They are resource managers.<br>  <br>  IT Consultants:  Highly skilled, very well rounded, Information Technology specialists able to guide analysts, developers, testers to delivery on IT Projects while managing client expectations.  They're often responsible for direct delivery of the IT portion of projects under the guidance of Project Managers (whom run the project plan across multiple domains - i.e. more than just IT).<br>  <br>  An IT Consultant should not be confused with an IT Contractor.  A Contractor is more like a hooker.  You're paid by the hour and are under the guidance of Employer.  You're at the bottom of the employment chain, but not really an employee.  And, you're the work horse that's expendable as soon as employees can pick up their work or projects are completed.  Consultants, on the other hand, can be employed or contracted.... but are generally much higher skilled.   Contractors get high wages too.... but those are justified due to the high risk of their job stability.
vqdurAA5aa	<<<What are the difference with the two?>>><br>  <br>  The SCZFB option is a traditional option that expires on June 20, the Saturday after the first Friday of the month.<br>  <br>  The ROQFB option is a quarterly that expires June 30.<br>  <br>  <<<Which one would I buy?>>><br>  <br>  Either one. I would probably choose the SCZFB option because it has a lower bid-ask spread. (The bid and ask prices are closer together.)<br>  <br>  <<<How doe the costs work?>>><br>  <br>  The price quotes are given "per share" and each contract represents 100 shares, so the actual price per contract is the 100 times the price displayed. Assuming your commision for buying once contract is $10, that would make the total cost of buying one SCZFB contract at market ($4.35 x 100) + $10 = $445.00<br>  <br>  <<<Hypothetically, If in 5 weeks SPY went up to 87.00, then could I take my stock at 80.00 per share and then sell it for 87?>>><br>  <br>  You could exercise the option, buying 100 shares for $8,000 then sell the shares on the open market at $8,700. Assuming you paid a $10 commision on both the purchase and the sale of the stock, that would make your total profit<br>  <br>  ($8,700 - $10) - ($8,000 + $10) - $445 = $235.<br>  <br>  That would, however, be the wrong thing to do. Five weeks from today is April 2, and the option does not expire until June 20. An $80 strike call options expiring June 20 would almost certainly be worth at least $9 per share, so you could instead simply sell the call option instead of exercising it. Assuming you sold it at $9 that would make your profit<br>  <br>  (($9 x 100) - $10) - $445 = $445<br>  <br>  You would be giving away over $200 by exercising the option and selling the stock instead of simply selling the option.

S4swOoyDaa	It's important to note what the tax credit benefit defines as a first-time home buyer. According to the bill, a person who hasn't owned a home for the past three years is considered a first-time buyer! This may be the loophole you are looking for. To qualify for the credit, the purchase has to be made before December 1st of 2009, so keep this in mind for your planning. <br>  <br>  Otherwise if both of you can not qualify as first-time buyers before December 1st, you would not qualify for the credit IF you are married (bostonia is right about this). You can ask your tax adviser OR a licensed mortgage expert for help. Any legitimate mortgage banker will give you straight-up advice for your situation, free of charge. <br>  <br>  For some information on the tax credit, check out this article: <a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/mortgage-news/stimulus-plan-includes-homebuyer-incentives-and-foreclosure-support-5526" rel="nofollow">https://www.quickenloans.com/mortgage-ne...</a><br>    <br>  For a complete summary of the all the tax relief provisions provided for in the bill, see the link in sources below.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No.  If one has never owned a home then that should be the only name on the deed.|`|AA11284831	Are you married or not??

UAW1U3Uoaa	If you are in the UK unless you work in a sector where Unions are not permitted then there is nothing he can do. You have a legal right to be a member of a Union, your employer does not have to recognise the Union but he must allow you to use its services including asking them for legal advice. He also has to follow the correct disciplinary procedure this will be outlined in your employment contract or handbook. He cannot simply say you are doing a bad job and sack you, you must be given proper official warnings and given the opportunity to improve. If he is bullying you then that is very serious and you could consider bringing a grievance through your HR department if it continues, your manager has a duty to help you if you are struggling by offering constructive criticism and training.|`|bNcL4RfZaa	Your manager can't fire you for going to a union.

With this, you would have ntohing to worry about at your job.  If you were to get "fired for getting advice from the union" then you would have him on tape threatening you, harassing you.

If he gets on your nerves so much that you feel obliged to resign ( this may be what he wants) you may well have a case for constructive dismissal ( you didn't want to resign, but he made life unbearable for you so you had to ) <br>  You should join the union, and they will stand by you. At least go to the Citizens advice bureau, if you are in the UK, and get the best advice  - for nothing. <br>  If you have had  a six-months trial period and then been confirmed in the job, you are in a stronger position than otherwise.

They are a good alternative if you do not qualify for a traditional cc. If you are looking into a secured card to build or rebuild your credit, make sure you go with a cc that will report to all 3 major credit bureaus. In time, if you show you are responsible, then either that company will "unsecure" the card, give you your deposit back, or you may qualify for a regular card. Good luck|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	A secured cc is a cc that is usually backed by a bank, credit union or similar financial institution. <br>  In order to open the account, you pay a certain amount of money (like $300, $500 or so) into a savings-type account as security. They will issue you a mainstream credit card with a limit that matches the funds that are in your account. <br>  You can use it like any normal Visa, Mastercard, etc. You charge money and they will bill you at the end of the cycle. The money will remain in the account you established as the bank will only use it if you fail to pay.... so you are expected to pay off/ pay on the cc as you would an unsecured card. <br>  After a time period of on-time payments, the bank usually closes your savings account and refunds your money; they then offer you an unsecured cc. <br>  <br>  Yes, they are an excellent way to build credit. I personally would find a local bank or credit union to establish one as opposed to a national company. <br>  Good luck!

If you want your credit score to go up (the thing banks use to judge loan interest rates), open 2-3 credit cards.  No more than 3, or your score will go down.

This means no interest, it's free.  After 5 years, it becomes a regular credit card, and your APR is adjusted to Market value.  This allows you to build credit history without the threat of paying interest if you keep a balance. The only thing is that your credit limit will be less than a regular credit card. About $2000 only.<br>  <br>  Also, If you're a student, you get,1 free overdraft per year on your checking account.

AA11284831	When did you apply?  Normally a claim period is one year which means that you applied in October of 2008, not exactly "recently."  Benefits are normally payable for 26 weeks in the claim year unless extensions have been granted.  There have been at least 2 extensions granted and possibly a 3rd.  The first was for 13 weeks.  The 2nd was for either 7 or 20 weeks depending upon your state's unemployment rate compared to the national rate.  There were additional extensions in the stimulus bill passed last week.<br>  <br>  Contact your state unemployment department.

LkOcJRRWaa	well since you have to work with her, I would involve the supervisor since you too couldn't work it out on your own.  If anything you have to be at least cordial when it comes to working together.|`|d305138b3a4d89bb9a20a75933040915aa	I have always found it amazing how women have no time limit on immaturity, it can go on forever. they will hold grudges as long as possible. Men, on the other hand will yell, cuss each other, and then move ahead. I'll bet there are few men in your office, meaning all of you are vying for attention from the few for whatever reasons, maybe to be moved ahead, maybe for dating, maybe for monetary reasons, maybe to just be noticed.<br>  You did your part and tried to talk, tried to apologize, you cannot do any more. This person is quite the baby. Thus, you have only 2 choices: deal with it, or leave. Do not let it get to you however. If you do it will be for no reason, and this co-worker will be the winner, and you the loser. Do your job, ignore this person, do not talk to anyone else about this, as it proves nothing, and may get back to you again. Or. as I said, get out.<br>  If you stay, and let it eat you up, you open yourself up to losing your appetite(or just the opposite and find yourself eating anything before you as a way to insulate against anger), getting high blood pressure, becoming nervous, unable to sleep, and will lose ability to fight sickness.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	you're both acting like children so yes, the supervisor is the best route to take.|`|LNBYoMCNaa	boss|`|4XVAMsL5aa	It sounds like your coworker may be border-line sociopathic. That is-she has an extremely severe social-ineptitude. She just can't handle pressure, Too much attention, or just plain loss of control over her situation. My suggestion: Stay away unless you absolutely can't. This is one backstabber that could turn the office into some scene from a SAW film if you tick her off or make her feel cornered. Of course, you could go to your boss, but it would really only make things worse, or end up in one of you(or both) getting laid off. This is a common happening seen as your employer may be afraid of a lawsuit should he/she pick a side. I would just let your coworker cool off for a week or two, then maybe invite her to an informal lunch or dinner, and apologize_even if you feel you were right. This may prompt her to take responsibility for her childish behavior and make her take a closer look at her actions. Hey, it might even lead to a reciprocal apology. Good luck, I wish youn all the best.|`|NvQMQv8Daa	Send her an email telling her your want to keep a business relationship, or coworker relashionship, that you know there where some issues in the past but for the sake of having a respectful place of business you have forgotten and have surpassed a common business friction. And if there was any fault on your part, you sincerely regret it.|`|pyBHdJ90aa	This is your fault.  You should not have dealt with her problem for two months.  That was her account to deal with.  The fact that you got involved means you had already breached an acceptable coworker boundary.  Time is the only thing that will solve this wound.  Tough luck, but don't barge in next time.|`|R78LnO1haa	yeah go to the boss. <br>  what a b*tch!|`|6d0iJ4RQaa	I think you did the right thing by trying to initiate conversation with her.  However, one thing that you have to keep in mind is that in the workplace...always keep things professional.  If she feels that the best way for her to resolve the situation is to ignore you, then you should respect her space and not talk to her anymore.  In my opinion, you did what you could to bring closure to the situation, you tried to initiate conversation, you tried to apologize for your behavior, and truthfully there is nothing else you can do.  For lack of a better term...the balls in her court.  If she wants to initiate conversation with you, then you should accept it, and move on from there.  From the sounds of your statement, it does seem like you were at fault with the situation, and respect that and respect the idea that all people handle conflict situations differently.  Some people are passive, some people are aggressive, and others just straight ignore the situation all together.  In this case scenario, it seems like your co-work has an ignorant way of handling conflict, "if I don't talk to her, then their isn't a problem."  With that said, respect her space, and as time passes, the situation will probably resolve itself, often times people with ignorant conflict personalities tend to just forget about it as time passes.  If you decide to escalate the situation, I personally think it will leave you in a corner, primarily because you did cause the conflict in the first place, and instead of having only one person who is mad at you, the entire office will probably label you a non-trustworthy person, and will probably be the outcast throughout the office.  With that said, take this advice...you did your best, and if she wants to ignore you, then accept that and move on...|`|9FtGwz7Vaa	I agree, it seems to be she is being very immature about the whole situation. It seems like it's out of your hands though. <br>  <br>  I'd give her some time to cool off, maybe about a week?<br>  By then she should have either forgot about it, or decided to let it go.<br>  If this however is still going on after that it's time you talk to your supervisor so it doesn't interfere with your work progress.<br>  <br>  I hope you're able to get things settled.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Yeah, your friend is correct.  You need to beware.  She sounds like the kind that will get you canned for any reason she can think of, or invent.<br>  I would go up to her, again, (but do not do it on company time)and state that you are sorry for the way things worked out.  By doing this, you are clearly showing that you are taking the high road, and that you are wanting to work things out like adults.  I know you have already apologized, but do it again in a sincere tone. When you are apologizing, dont say "I'm sorry, but....." <br>  a true apology states "i'm sorry for..."  Putting the "but" in the apology only implies that you are really not to blame, and that youre really not sorry..<br>  <br>  Then, give it a couple of days.  In the mean time, be cordial..but don't be overly friendly, like some kind of suck-up.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

The W-2 box 12a, code D is for "elective deferrals to a section 401(k) cash or deferred arrangement. Also includes deferrals under a SIMPLE retirement account that is part of a section 401(k) arrangement."

And it would depend if 2% is the PERIOD rate or the ANNUAL rate.<br>  <br>  If 2% is the period rate, then:<br>  <br>  Annually (1987-2008): About $3,800<br>  Bi-annually: About $5,700<br>  Quarterly: About $13,200<br>  <br>  If 2% is the annual rate, then:<br>  <br>  Somewhere between $3,100 and $3,700.<br>  <br>  Basically the higher the rate and the more often it is compound (calculated) then the more money you should have.

And apparently, many compassionate consumers are continuing to fall for the convincing sob stories, the unfailingly polite language, and the unequivocal promises of money. These advance-fee solicitations are scams. And according to the FTC, the scam artists are playing each and every consumer for a fool. Here's the play book:Claiming to be Nigerian officials, businesspeople or the surviving spouses of former government honchos, con artists offer to transfer millions of dollars into your bank account in exchange for a small fee. If you respond to the initial offer, you may receive "official looking" documents. Typically, you're then asked to provide blank letterhead and your bank account numbers, as well as some money to cover transaction and transfer costs and attorney's fees.You may even be encouraged to travel to Nigeria or a border country to complete the transaction. Sometimes, the fraudsters will produce trunks of dyed or stamped money to verify their claims. Inevitably, though, emergencies come up, requiring more of your money and delaying the "transfer" of funds to your account; in the end, there aren't any profits for you to share, and the scam artist has vanished with your money.<br>  If You Receive an Offer<br>  If you're tempted to respond to an offer, the FTC suggests you stop and ask yourself two important questions: Why would a perfect stranger pick you — also a perfect stranger — to share a fortune with, and why would you share your personal or business information, including your bank account numbers or your company letterhead, with someone you don't know? And the U.S. Department of State cautions against traveling to the destination mentioned in the letters. According to State Department reports, people who have responded to these "advance-fee" solicitations have been beaten, subjected to threats and extortion, and in some cases, murdered.|`|EXm6lelaaa	I am in the same situation too.  so I searched about this company and only thing I could find was this job site.   <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/london/20/35058120.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gumtree.com/london/20/3505812...</a><br>  I believe, they're actually hiring in UK.  but I am still not sure about this job.|`|xuXWtlEWaa	I am in the same situation.

FN3KQgwPaa	I am an avid ebay seller, and what you have to do is go on ebay and search your product. If people are selling it and people bid over $10 for it, then you know that you will make that much. For example; I sell a baseball card and I see that it's selling for up to $25 US dollars. I put it at 0.99, and then I write a lot of stuff about it, such as "mint condition, extremely rare, etc etc."<br>  <br>  I ended up making $30.00 on it. So just research it first. If worst comes to worst, put a reserve on it.<br>  <br>  Email me @ moosefacexd@hotmail.com for more help|`|AA11510511	There isn't a way.

Lets say you want to start the bidding at $1 to attract lots of attention, but you don't want to sell for less than $20. You set a reserve price of $20 when you set up the listing. Then when someone looks at the listing and the price is still below $20, it will say "reserve not met." It won't tell buyers what the reserve price is, only that it has not yet been reached. When the price goes above $20, the message will change to "reserve met." <br>  <br>  If the final price of the item exceeds your reserve price, then the sale continues like normal. The buyer sends payment and the seller mails the product. If the final bid is below the reserve price by even one penny, then the sale is canceled. The message of "reserve not met" alerts buyers that if the price does not go up, the sale will not happen. <br>  <br>  When you set up your listing, you'll pay a fee for setting a reserve price, plus your listing fees are based on the reserve price. So it costs you an extra dollar or two but its a good way to protect yourself if something is valuable and you're worried about it selling too low.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	You can't.  Start the bid at the item cost so you can be sure you make or exceed what you paid for it.
