(im trying to use present tense, but the embedded quotes i use are past tense!)   -weird wording of sentence?   -sentences structure      problems?               In The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the author presents the characters in which their physical appearances mirror their mental, emotional, or moral state. Roger Chillingworth and Arthur Dimmesdale are two such characters that portray these characteristics. Hawthorne uses descriptive language such as rhetorical devices. Detail and imagery for example, are used to accomplish this goal. Detail is used to lay facts of Chillingworth’s characteristics, while imagery is portrayed to display Dimmesdale’s physical features. At the same time, this better relates how peoples outsides, represent their insides.           Nathaniel Hawthorne conveys descriptive detail in this writing to portray a relation between Chillingworth’s outward appearance and inner emotions.  By doing so, the author presents the character as a sickened old man, seeking vengeance against Reverend Dimmesdale. It is also ironic to analyze Chillingworth’s name; chill, may in other words mean a raw, cold-hearted being. One of his “…shoulders [also] rose high[-er] than the other…a slight deformity of the figure…” (57), which can conclude that he is unbalanced, not knowing how to balance right and wrong, which leads to a dark, ugly, corrupted and “distorted” figure. Roger Chillingworth had arranged a stay at Dimmesdale’s house, “so that every ebb and flow of the minister’s life-tide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician” (114). Although he is Dimmesdale’s physician, he has an insincere hatred towards the minister. He wants to wreak vengeance upon Old Mr. Dimmesdale once finding that he is the adulterer of Hester Prynne. Chillingworth has “… a terrible fascination, a kind of fierce, though calm, necessity seized the old man within its gripe, and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding. He now dug into the poor clergyman’s heart, like a miner searching for gold…” (117). By portraying descriptive detail in that passage, Hawthorne then exhibits the actions and inner emotions of Chillingworth’s wishes to wreak revenge upon Reverend Dimmesdale. Chillingworth has a “dept of malice, [toward] the unfortunate old man, which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy” (127), he is “the spring that controlled the engine; and the physician knew it well!”(127). Chillingworth is letting his rage and anger devour him, turning him into a mindless machine whose intent goal is to torture and agonize Reverend Dimmesdale.          Chillingworth had all the strength and energy he needed, that that drove him to inflict misery and woe upon old Reverend Dimmesdale, but “… after Dimmesdale’s death, in the appearance and demeanor of the old man known as Roger Chillingworth. All his strength and energy—all this vital and intellectual force, seemed at once to desert him; insomuch that he positively withered up, shriveled away, and almost vanished from mortal sight, like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun” (232). He lived to do the devils bidding, and once done, he let himself rot; there was no reason for him to live.   Chillingworth was no longer a man of intellect, but a man of full of vengeance which had taken over his entire body destroying all the good within him. He had made revenge his everything, but once Dimmesdale had died, there was no need of vengeance in his soul, and he was left with nothing, there was no heart within his soul. In short, “… there was no more Devils work on earth for him to do” (232).           In The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne also displays imagery of Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale in the novel to portray how inner emotions can mirror their outer appearances. Dimmesdale was once a very “… young clergyman, who had come from one of the great English universities, bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forest-land” (62). He was “…of very striking aspect, with a white, lofty, and impending, brow, large, brown, melancholy eyes” (62).With imagery applied, Hawthorne presents Dimmesdale as a lively young priest. Though Dimmesdale soon grows insecure of his surroundings, guilt starts to lay heavy on his shoulders from the lie that causes him misery. His conscious and guilt begins to torture him. He clenches his heart as if some inner emotions pain him; he shortly grows to trust no friend. “He loathed his miserable self!” (130), with such fault, Dimmesdale begins lose his strength and grows weaker and weaker by day especially with Chillingworth hovering over his shoulders. Guilt and shame has caused him despair and also weakens his heart. After years o

20090202081825AAIFopW	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What could be wrong with me?	A few days before christmas I started getting headaches each day. I can't remember exactly how long they lasted for, but that's another thing. I'm sure that I seem to have memory loss sometimes. My eyes are also constantly weird. I can't exactly explain it as I've kind of got more used to it, but my eyes feel sore and a bit blurry all the time, and I also get eye pains and feel dizzy sometimes.      I do worry a lot especially about illnesses as my grandad died of cancer, and there is a good chance that it's nothing serious. I've had dizziness for years and also acute memory loss, and the sickness and pains could be because of my eyesight. I'm shortsighted and I recently went for a test and found that I need a new prescription. My glasses I have now did seem to hurt my eyes since I first had them, but then they went ok. I also skip meals sometimes, especially breakfast, so this could also be a cause. Also, I'm only fourteen anyway, and the problems happen everyday but I don't suffer in any other way (eg, I'm still able to think clearly) so this could just be nothing.      This may seem a bit long and confusing, and not really a question, but, like I already said, I worry and I'm not the kind of person who shares their problems with people I know and askes to go see a doctor, and I prefer to keep things bottled up, so I just thought I'd get help from somewhere else as apparently these symptoms are signs of a brain tumour.

20090202152805AATxipa	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you help me make this paragraph sound better and more educated?	In the words of NBA Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley, “Look for your choice, pick the best one, then go for it.” In life we are constantly being faced with choices. Some choices can be as easy as choosing whether to eat vanilla ice cream or chocolate cake for dessert, or as difficult as deciding who you will choose to spend the rest of your life with. Choices can either make or break us; they can bring about much happiness or can cause us much pain. The main characters of the poem The Road Not Taken and the short stories, A&P and The Hills Like White Elephants all made the life-altering choices to stand up for their beliefs and not conform to the ways of society. Although sacrifices came along with each of the characters’ choices, each chose a path that would ultimately lead to their true happiness.

Do you know what your children are watching on television? “By the time a child is eighteen years old, he or she will witness on television 200,000 acts of violence including 40,000 murders.” As parents we should monitor and put a limit on what our child watches on the television. As a parent of a five year old daughter, I don’t expose her to watching violent movies and cartoons that I feel and inappropriate at her age. For example, when we go to the movie theater I pick a movie suitable for the family. Second, at home I have to supervise what cartoons she wishes to see and that I feel it’s appropriate for her as well. And I prefer her to watch something that is more educational yet entertaining at the same time such as bindi the jungle girl in the kids discovery channel. Parents need to know what their children are watching. I feel its very important to

I'm a really active person..I like to go outside and enjoy life..   but when it comes tho chores, homework, or doing something for someone  i set my mind on it... but never get around to it.   I tell myself I'm going to do it.. but always end up procrastinating.   When i tell myself i'm going to be on the computer for only 10 min, i end up staying on for 2 hours.   Whenever I say i'm going to do my homework, i end up waiting till last minute.   I try to stop this habit, but it's sooo hard.   I usually don't go to bed till 2 in the morning, but I don't get up till10 so i'm still getting good sleep... but usually when it's around 3 in the afternoon i start feeling really tireed, even though i got a lot of sleep.   Why is this?      I feel so lazy and i never pick up my trash or even consider asking someone if they need help picking up stuff, or cleaning.      I feel soo lazy and i don't know why.   I also get out of school a lot pretending i'm sick even though school doesn't start till 11 for me, i still am too lazy to go!   ahhhh helpppppppp

My friend, Emily, comes to visit me every Saturday. Last year, she would always ride the elevator to the 7th floor and walk up the rest of the way. This year, she rides the elevator to the 9th floor and then walks up the rest of the way: Why?      2) Last week I went to the baseball game, and my favorite team, the Yankees, beat their opponents, the Tigers, 14 to 3.They managed to do this without a single man on the Yankees team scoring a run. How?      3) Two train tracks run parallel except for 1 spot where they go into a tunnel. The tunnel is not wide enough to accommodate both tracks, so they become a single track for the length of the tunnel. One afternoon, a train entered the tunnel going in one direction, and another entered the tunnel going in the other direction. How did they avoid the accident?

20090203001715AA0H7tE	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Grammar check please?	Not many children are born as a prodigy; although many parents yearns their children to be a prodigy. Most genius exists due to the hard work that compels from their parents. Most of the children under protection of parents are assured with their welfare. Matters such as, getting presents on special occasions, eating three meals a day, or even just having a family can be small gratification. However, parent’s overly exaggerated worries can be burden for their children, especially on academic performances. Good examples are illustrated in parent’s inordinate interference on their off spring’s academic career. Most parents are willing to dedicate their life to raise children to be bit better than other family; from a motive to give out their children a more preferable conduct and occupation. On the other hand, regardless on amount of expense spent on child’s education, if parent overly interference in youngster’s academic vocation, vast demand can sacrifices children’s imagination, fantasy of world and childhood.    Parent’s desire for their children to be more ahead than others can limit youngster’s future. Because most of parents did not have much opportunity to educate themselves to pursue their happiness and life, they seek to search self satisfaction by leading their children to flourish in the same society which has repudiated them when they were young. Therefore, sending children to private schools and often to numerous after-schools, only allowing them to work on academic tasks; making kids exhausted with works. Especially parents who decide their children’s future, concluding they recognize kid’s essentials and demands, damages child’s belief of them having boundless futures. Once parents have determined off spring’s future, it is most likely for children to have limited sight and even terminate potentiality to find their own true aspirations. As my father, Ho-yeon Hwang had a dream as a child to become a classical musician, until my grandfather demanded his son to become an Oriental Medical Doctor. Since my grandfather was an Oriental Medical Doctor and owned a hospital, he had strongly suggested Ho-yeon to be an Oriental doctor to inherit the hospital. When Ho-yeon brought out his dream about being a musician to his father, he was punished and was to be confined in his room for a month. For that reason, my father had abandoned his childhood dream and started studies on oriental medicine. As Ho-yeon started to study oriental herbs, he needed to go to at least three different institutes to catch up with the education; there was no free time to get any hobby. Aftermath, he became an Oriental Medical Doctor, but although Ho-yeon became a doctor, the compulsion from grandfather to become a doctor had both ruined his dream from childhood and gave a wound in an innocent child’s heart.

I made a stupid mistake, I took out a book entitled a Raisin in the sun and it wasn't the actualy play it was just a literary component. And for tomorrow i have to read the play and answer discussion questions. I am going to post them here. If anyone can answer them for me, you save me. I will be able to participate in the discussion and get a good grade. I would have done it myself, but I can't find the play on the net. The internet only has the synopsis which is not enough So here are the questions:      1) A Raisin in the sun was written half a century ago. How relevant, today, are the story and the struggle of the characters? How universal is the subject matter? The situation?      2) Will African American relate more easily to A Raisin in the Sun than other groups? In what ways can other groups relate to it?      3) Will it help to understand the play better if we know the social and political climate of 1950s and 1960s?      PLEASE HELP!!!!
