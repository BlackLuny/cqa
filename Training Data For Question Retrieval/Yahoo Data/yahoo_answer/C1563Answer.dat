MhelxLdFaa	I have been to japan with a group of people from my school inc. teachers. It was a great trip and something that made me feel more independent.  At first we stayed with host families which was a little hard because ofthe language barrier but soon became better. the only thing was my family were quite shy and this was quite annoying when you want to and are used to talking pretty much all day.  Then we went and did all the "touristy" sorts of things. This included going to disneyland (bit of a disappointment seein as a thought it was gonna be massive). Also, himeji castle, toyko sightseeing (very fun at night with a bunch of teenagers), riding trains (thank god for travel agents who know where they are going), hiroshima peace museum (a must for everybody, really sad but interesting) and harajuku (also a must for younger people who like shopping and seeing some weird people dressed up).  Great trip and would recommend going to japan from anyone to young people to families. Really safe also.    (10 points please!)|`|vQTYDR1oaa	Yes. Love it but a long list....
hNfg7oXeaa	I think it looks quaint and cozy.  But perhaps a bit crammed.  Have a great trip!

Se vuoi trovare un biglietto a buon prezzo ti consiglio di non andare subito sul sito di una compagnia in particolare (lo puoi fare in seguito).  Ci sono alcuni siti che, sulla base di cosa richiedi, ti indicano tutti i voli (di tutte le compagnie) e i loro costi.  Prova a fare alcune ricerche sui siti:  www.volagratis.it  www.edreams.it  www.lastminutetour.com   Se vuoi risparmiare evita di acquistare il pacchetto assicurativo che ti propongono unitamente al biglietto (basta non mettere la crocetta sull'assicurazione).

uz018yafaa	1- We eat buckwheat noodles 31st Dec, New year's eve.    2- Before we start to eat any food, we put our hands together and say" ITADAKIMASU"  means we are living thanks to food stuffs's life. We nderstand human beings are killing other creatures to eat. So we appreciate their life.     3- Miso soup      Every family has distinct menu on Miso soup.   Some put pieces of carrot on it, some don't.  Some put a pieces of yam on it, some don't.|`|c49bf5f7dd5a22fd26b76d86f10336f3aa	1) Sticky(really)rice with red beans called "Oseki-han".  We have this on any festive occasions, such as baby birth, birthday or wedding.  Anything to do with fun and happy time.      2) No rituals.  We just say "Itadaki masu."  Meaning, "I will have this(with respect)."    3) Rice, anything from the ocean, vegetables.|`|pMrdTbCXaa	1)  As said, end of the year "Soba".  It's buckwheat noodles in a nice soup.  Very simple and meant to mean longevity, unless I'm mistaken.  It's the last meal of the year and eaten either at dinner or an hour or two before midnight on Dec. 31st.    From Jan 1-3, people are supposed to eat "Osechi".  It's a traditional New Year's feast.  The food tends to be small and very sweet.  I usually see sweet black beans, shrimp, and a fish paste thing.  It's traditionally not that good.  The tradition is that you don't cook for the first 3 days of the year, so you need something relatively preserved to last for the first 3 days.    Sake is generally served in a traditional Shinto wedding.  It's not served in Western style weddings.    Other than that, there are only seasonal foods, but that's a completely different question, and very hard to answer quickly.    2)  Itadakimasu (mentioned many times before)  You may also want to know "Gochisosamadesu" or "Gochisosamadeshita" which is said after the meal is finished.  It's generally a way to say thank you for the meal.    3)  Sushi is not a common food, from what I've heard and asked.  It's considered a special food for special occasions.  While this may not be food, beer is very popular among working men, and they tend to eat "tsukemono" with it.  It's essentially Japanese pickles.  It is far from the traditional American pickle, and it can very greatly in taste.  They also tend to eat a lot of fried food, such as karage.  For working men, eating donburi is common.    Being Winter, the most common food is probably nabe.  It's a simple soup with various meat and vegetables that is boiled for a few minutes.  Very easy and simple to make and very delicious.    To go into further detail would take a LONG time, so that's just a sample of some of the common foods Japanese people tend to eat.  This is also just from my own observations.|`|20c07534a18ce17f8fab7531f7306bbcaa	-There are some traditional foods that are usually for holidays which vary depending on the kind of occasion that is celebrated  -Well the most basic is right before they start eating they say the phrase "Itadakimasu!" which comes from the word "Itadaku" which means to receive. Since your saying this before you eat, it means "to receive food"  -In different regions of Japan, there are a variety of foods that are commonly eaten there. Some that I can think of is sushi (of course) and sashimi which is just raw fish with no rice.    I hope this answers ur questions ^_^|`|jSQNYgIPaa	Q1-are there any japenesse foods that they save for special occasions    In my case, we often have Chirashi-Zushi on special day.   Chirashi-zushi is vinegared rice with thin strips of egg, pieces of raw fish, vegetables and crab meat arranged on top.   It's very colorful, so looks really gorgeous!  Sometimes, we have Sekihan, which is red rice. Sekihan is very traditional celebratory food in Japan, but I think it's far from modern.      Q2-are there any rituals they perform before eating    ummm...we don't do anything those kinda things usually.  Commonly, we say "Itadaki masu" joinning our hands in prayer, but I don't think it's ritual.      Q3-what is some of the most common foods they eat    on special occasions?    I'll edit later!

ebijsVIAaa	Yes you can take your laptop into the aircraft cabin but remove it from it's carrying case and place it in a separate bin when it goes through the x-ray scanner at the terminal checkpoint.  There's also a good chance the TSA agents will ask you to turn it on to prove it's a working computer.    You can store the laptop under the seat in front of you so that you don't have to get up to retrieve it from the overhead bins.  You can use the laptop in flight as soon as the captain gives the "OK" for use of electronic devices.  Charge it before your flight because there are no AC outlets in most commercial aircraft for passenger use.  Turn it off when the flight attendants or the pilots request for you to do so ...... they get touchy when passengers have to be asked multiple times.   I have always brought my laptop into the cabin and as long as you follow the simple directions I have listed above, it should be smooth sailing.

Like other polls taken in recent years, this one shows a continuing reversal of the Israelization of the country's Arab sector that was apparent through the mid-1990s. Only 33 percent of the 1,202 Arab citizens surveyed said the term "Israeli" best defines their identity, compared to 63 percent in 1995. Only 35 percent said they feel a stronger affinity to Israeli Jews than they do to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, compared to 50 percent six years ago. Almost half  46 percent  said they reject Israel's existence as a Zionist state, compared with 35 percent in 1995. A majority of 58 percent said that the intifada had distanced them from the state.    Nadim Rouhana is a professor specializing in Conflict Analysis at George Mason University and heads Mada al-Carmel, the Arab Center for Applied Social Research.  Here's what he has to say on December 13 2007:    During Israel's establishment, three-quarters of a million Palestinians were driven from their homes or fled in fear. They remain refugees to this day, scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza, the Arab world and beyond. We Palestinian citizens of Israel are among the minority who managed to remain on our land. Like many Mexican-Americans, we didn't cross the border, the border crossed us. We have been struggling ever since against a system that subjects us to separate and unequal treatment because we are Palestinian Arabs--Christian, Muslim and Druze--not Jewish. More than twenty Israeli laws explicitly privilege Jews over non-Jews.    The Palestinian Authority is under intense pressure to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. This is not a matter of semantics. If Israel's demand is granted, the inequality that we face as Palestinians--roughly 20 percent of Israel's population--will become permanent.    On 3 Feb 2009  dandyl, Top Contributor on Israel in Yahoo!Answers had this to say:    its a democratic country, no one forces anyone to sing or do anything against there free will.The Israeli Arabs are very happy living in Israel, they dont complain|`|Me2oJOtAaa	i imagine they feel much the same way as Hindus, muslims , christians etc feel in this country when they sing '' god save the queen''    England is a christian country- people who come here and / or are born here know that.

Its their choice and unlike many peacefull muslim countries their heads WONT be chopped off if they refuse to sing it at national events.     If arab israeli citizens so object to the words of the israeli national anthem there are many many muslim countries they could go to instead.

No such accommodations have ever been made for Jews living in Muslim countries.  - - - -   EDIT: re: pibroch1234 - That survey only proves what I've been saying all along.  As soon as the Arabs get their 58th and 59th Arab countries (WB & Gaza) there will be yet another uprising within Israel by more Arab terrorists who suddenly feel "offended" and they will demand that yet one more chunk of Israel be handed over to them to give the Arabs a 60th country.     Israel never should have let any of them stay there.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	Israel is the Jewish state.    There are 22 Arab states.      .|`|hZltMpiPaa	since they don't have "Jewish souls", have basically been told they are guests in their own land, probably are separated from their families and anyone who means anything to them, and are MOST definitely NOT a "free people in their land"...    I'd probably feel like i wanted to cry and scream at the same time.  wouldn't you?        p.s. the person who says Israel is 'hospitable' to arabs with citizenship...needs to open their eyes.  i have arab friends who have been in israel, both Christians and Muslims.  they were not allowed to speak to anyone about their faith, only permitted to answer a direct question with "yes" or "no", and victims of racism wherever they went in the so-called "Holy Land".  sounds like a lot of fun, right?  jeez, who wouldn't want to go to Israel??

It belongs to the Arab Revolt grouping of Arab flags and is a deliberate copy of the Jordanian flag (minus the star), which presumably represents the historical link to 1920-23 when Palestine and Transjordan were one territory. I think the flag was adopted in 1964 at the creation of the PNC and PLO, possibly a little later. It was definitely in use by 1974 when the Arab League declared the PLO the sole representative of all Palestinians and the UN granted the PLO observer status. There was no single Palestinian authority prior to 1964 that could have created a flag.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	Approximately four decades ago.

Then adopted by both countries. The israeli flag was created much earlier in 1885 then adopted by the gov't in 1948. The flag was created by Rishon LeZion (one of the first zionist cities). All of the countries of the middle east are new. Therefore, all of their flags are fairly recent. Oddly enough, the Israeli flag is older than most of the middle eastern flags.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	The Birth Of The Flag Of Israel  The Story of Morris Harris- Designer of the Flag of Israel    Jews and their friends the world have celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel (declaration of independence is May 14). Few, however, know the true story behind the flag of that ancient Jewish Nation, now a modern State.  The story begins in a very small town called Svadish in Lithuania (then a part of Russia).    Morris (Maishel Arriz in Hebrew) was born there in 1874. Svadish was one block long with very small one-story houses, except for the Harris house which had two stories. The first floor of this house contained their blacksmith shop, ice house and saloon. The townsfolk gathered in the saloon on Saturday nights to drink and listen to the Harris family entertain, for they were also the village musicians.    Life was very hard for Russian Jews. They were not permitted to own or farm the land. When they were attacked during the horrific pogroms of the 1880's, many Jews fled Russia. In 1891 Morris' family, his father, mother, sister and brother joined the thousands immigrating to America - A Land of Freedom and Golden Opportunity!    Arriz had been Morris' family name in the old country. It meant Cedar Tree in Hebrew. (Other relatives are called "Cedarbaum" (Yiddish-German). When the Ellis Island official asked their name - they answered "Arriz!" The official wrote down "Harris!" - and so it was from then on.    The Harris family settled in New York City with relatives who lived in Harlem.    To earn some money Morris and his father bought a pushcart. They sold soft drinks (a saloon on wheels). One day after a severe windstorm, a store owner asked Morris if he could repair a torn awning. Because his mother, Lena, was an expert seamstress, Morris took the awning to her. Thus began Morris Harris' career in awning repair, upholstery, and flag decoration.    Eventually the family opened a shop called the "Harlem Upholsterer" on 116th street, between Lenox and 5th Avenue. They specialized in canvas products, awnings, bags, and covers. They also created flags and banners for parades and special affairs.    Morris was designer and inventor.    When his father died before the end of the century, Morris became the head of the family. He welcomed into his home many relatives and friends newly arrived in America. They were known as "Landsmen" (coming from the same town or same area.) They would be helped and housed temporarily until they found their own way to make a living. One of these house guests was a young, beauty with curly red hair named Mary Kahn. Love bloomed. Soon Morris and Mary became man and wife.    The young couple became interested in a social group known as "Hovevei Zion" (Lovers of Zion). This group had a goal of saving money to buy land in Palestine for a Jewish settlement. The money they saved was returned after a year because the Ottoman Empire discouraged Jewish group settlement in Palestine. But the dream did not die.    In 1897 the first international meeting of worldwide Jewry was held in Basil, Switzerland, to consider establishing a homeland for Jews in Palestine. It was to be a haven for oppressed Jews from all over the world. Representatives from Hovevei Zion groups attended this meeting. The returning New York Hovevei Zion representative was greeted with a reception in which various members contributed their talents in cooking, baking, etc.    Morris Harris used his talents to design a suitable banner and decorations for the reception. He created a flag of Zion. He made it the same size as the standard American flag - 6 x 10 feet. He chose the colors from the traditional Jewish prayer shawl the "Tallis." It was sky blue and white, symbolic of heaven and earth. He designed two horizontal stripes with the biblical six-pointed Star of David between the stripes. His mother, Lena Harris, actually sewed the flag. They also made twelve smaller flags representing the 12 tribes of Jews.     Hovevei Zion loved the flag. Soon other groups were requesting Zion flags for their organizations. It was accepted as the official Zionist flag at the second International Congress held in Switzerland in 1898. Morris Harris continued making flags of Zion for many years until he gave the design to the American Flag Company.    The Flag of Zion was used as the "Jewish Flag" everywhere in the world until 1948. Then, when the State of Israel was born, it too adopted Morris' creation as the official flag.    Morris Harris lived to see this great honor. When his mother Lena died, to honor her part in it, he had inscribed "The first Zion flag was made by her" on her tombstone.    Although he never left his adopted country, America, Morris Harris was a dedicated Zionist who wanted all Jews to have the option of returning to the ancient homeland of their people.     His dream lives on as the Flag of Israel flies high over the Jewish State.      .|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	http://jordanwhite.com/Images/Palestinia...  This flag was designed in 1916 as a flag for the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, and was used by the Arab national movement.  [Under the Ottoman Empire, from the 1500s till its end after WWI, there was no place officially called Palestine.]  Only in 1948 was it adopted by the "all Palestine government," an organization that was formed after anti-Jewish Arabs were unable to stop the establishment of Israel.  Later it was adopted by the PLO.|`|QoNEfo5Haa	The flag was created in 1916, but it wasn't originally for Palestine. It wasn't until 1948 that the flag was adopted by them.|`|t58rc9tCaa	The Palestinian flag is extremely recent.    Just take a look - a green triangle (green being the favorite color of Muhammad, so a symbol of Islam) and a red, white, and black tricolor (red, black, and white were the colors of the pan-Arab nationalist movement, and can still be found on the flags of almost every Arab country).    Same with the language - Arabic. The religion - Islam. The culture, the customs - nothing so very different from Syria or Egypt or Jordan. Just what is so different about "Palestine"?    ARABS AND PALESTINIANS ADMITTED:    "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism.     "For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan."  - Zahir Muhsein, PLO executive committee member, interviewed by the Dutch newspaper Trouw, March 31, 1977    "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate."  - Prince Hassan, Jordanian National Assembly, February 2, 1970    "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture."  - Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan, 1980    "There is no such thing as 'Palestine' in history."  - Arab-American Princeton historian Philip Hitti, testifying before the Anglo-American Committee    "Palestine has never existed - before or since - as an autonomous entity... There was no language known as Palestinian. There was no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a Palestine governed by the Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc."  - Arab-American columnist Joseph Farah    "Since we cannot defeat Israel in war, we do this in stages. We take any and every territory that we can of Palestine, and establish a sovereignty there, and we use it as a springboard to take more. When the time comes, we can get the Arab nations to join us for the final blow against Israel."  - Yassir Arafat, Jordan TV, September 12, 1993

nEgJAtK7aa	Internet connection was very slow the one time I ever purchased the internet package it was $100 for 200 min. It would use 4 min just signing on. I do not know about VOIP I am not sure if that is available. I know with a cell phone you need international calling on your plan and then it is whatever the cost is with your plan plus international roaming fees. You for sure dont want to use the ship phone in your room depending on the cruise line it runs around $9.95 per min I hope this helps.|`|94b8KImYaa	I found there is a difference between cruise lines, how fast an internet connection is. mostly they are reliable. For VOIP calls, expect some interruption or a not so great signal, but it works. I don't use the ship's computers, but my laptop, since most of the ships have wireless access by now. With this, you control better when it starts charging, since you can get all ready before you connect.     Regarding mobile phones, be careful, because by now many of the cruise ships will route through their system, which will cost you additional pennies (more dollars) when you call from the ship. Even if you are docked in one of the islands and you are thinking you are calling from Puerto Rico to your destination - you could be on the ship's network which will cost you much more.   To avoid that you would need to know the network of the place you are at and manually change that on your phone - or walk off the ship to make your call.
o5aHZ1Xdaa	I can't comment on a high school for environmental studies (wish i would have known about one of those 7 years ago when i was a freshman), but i can tell you that environmental studies is an amazing field.    But if your are getting into in it for the greenhouse gasses and the polar bears, your in the wrong subject. Environmental science is much deeper then what you see in the movies, it is the wide range of traditional science and social science disciplines that are brought together in order to understand and manage the natural environment. It combines physical, chemical, and biological science with a detailed understanding of contemporary social issues.    it makes my knees shake just typing about it =D    good luck!    -Shamar

He takes him over the Sydney harbour bridge.. .and says .. " Hey Mate, this is the Sydney Harbour Bridge... It took x-many years to build it and it cost the lives of x-many men and it cost x-many million of dollars .. It's a beauty ain't it....."    His american cousin looks at him .. and laughs .. " Hey Bud .. we have a bridge three times the size of that little pecker .. it cost ten times as much and it only took three months to build and seven times the men died building it"    The aussie is a little bit annoyed at that .. .but then he shows his cousin the Sydney Opera House... " Hey Mate, see that building there.. That's the Sydney Opera house. We got some world famous architect to design it .. got her royal highness  Queen Elizabeth the Second to Open it. It took X-many years to build... and cost x-many dollars.. It's pretty bonza isn't it mate ?"    The american snickers.. " well I guess so if you have no faith in your architects and you have to get some old biddy from another country to open it. We have a grand ol' opera house back home.. american designed.. american opened ,, and it only took six weeks to build and cost 16 times that weener of an opera house of yours did"    The aussie decides to take a drive out of the city ... contemplates taking a turn off into the Belangalo state forest cos his cousin is driving him mad....    Suddenly a kangaroo bolts across the highway... .  "Holy Moley .. What the F*ck was that,? the american exclaims..     The aussie thinks quick and replies with .. " THAT my dear cousin..

I honestly have never really talked about where I am from. I come from Florida and sure it's beautiful, especially the beach that I live on (when not in Japan) and if someone asks me where I am from, I will tell them... they usually say "oh nice, we hear Florida is wonderful and I will say yeah it's beautiful, but I don't rave about it. I might say, if you ever get a chance to go there, I recommend it... but that's about it.  Normally I am complimenting the locals on how nice their area is and it's nothing like back home...     Like the person above stated, I'm also surprised she went on about how great Detroit was... not many people (including people who grow up there) have anything good to say about it.     I will say one positive thing about Detroit and it's the only positive... the airport is wonderful. The customs agents there are extremely kind and helpful. Very short lines, don't hassle you and actually help you if you need it. I have flown thru many airports and Detroit has been the only positive experience so, I always fly into Detroit when I am flying back and forth to and from japan.

hZltMpiPaa	i've asked the same question myself.    but the truth is, Israel would never accept this.  to be an Israeli citizen, all you have to do is prove is one grandparent on either side was Jewish (ethnically).  in this case, i could get an Israeli citizenship even though I'm not Jewish.  most israelis are atheists...the country is based on genetics, not faith.  a variation on ethnic purity if you will...    so of course they would never allow arabs to live in the same country as them with equal rights!  that would mean that Israel would not just be for Jews anymore.  if anyone proposed this Israel would be outed as a racist, 'apartheid' state....    if i actually thought this was a remote possibility it would be wonderful.  but it's not...the point of Israel is keep non-Jews out and quiet.  honestly i believe the only solution will be either when US & UN withdraws support for Israel, or when all the Palestinians are dead.  i wonder which will happen first...|`|zy8mKJxeaa	That failed experiment of a one state solution was tried in Lebanon with disastrous results for the Christians living there.

As an ex israeli and a jew im fine with arabs/ palastinians / muslims whoever living in israel. There are actually a lot of things I like and find interesting about arab culture and i think it would make israel an interesting place...     but what so many people seem to have forgotten in all this conflict is that PEACE TAKES TWO  sides to make.     any kind of solution is a pipe dream until the muslim fanatics and palastinians loose their thirst for jewish blood..     and i personally think, sadly that a one state solution is an impossibility...     you only have to look around the world to see that islam as it exists at the moment is intolerant of any one who isnt a muslim.     how can you have peace with a people that dont recognise your right to exist at all , let alone exist in their own state  and that advocate strapping bombs to children and blowing up families as a justified way of making their point ??|`|BTSQBk6Taa	It sounds nice to those of us who understand democracy, but it can't work.

As is the case today, however, the suggestion enjoyed no popular support.    The utopian view of the advocates of a one was that the Jews and Arabs both had legitimate claims to the land and should live in peace together in one state. This idea negated the Jewish right to its historic homeland and also assumed the Arabs were prepared to coexist peacefully with the Jews within the same state. This was proven wrong through two decades of violence by Arabs against Jews in Palestine, and by the Arab rejection of the British White Paper of 1939, which offered them just such an arrangement.    As early as 1937, it had become clear that the two peoples could not live together and needed to have states of their own. As a result, the Peel Commission proposed a partition in that year and the UN approved the same approach a decade later. Nothing has changed since that time to suggest any other solution can end the conflict.    Since Palestinian Arabs already constitute almost 45 percent of the population living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, and their birth rate is double that of Israeli Jews, they would soon become the majority of the population in a binational state. The Jewish character of the nation would then erode and disappear, and Israeli Jews would lose political control over the one safe haven for Jews.    Given the historical mistreatment of minorities, especially Jews, in Arab lands, this idea would be a recipe for the persecution of Jews (and Christians).One proponent of the idea of a binational state suggested that an international force would protect the Jews, but no leader would entrust the fate of the Jewish people to such an unreliable guarantor. More important, if advocates of a one state solution acknowledge that Jews would need protection in such a state, what is the basis for believing this is a solution to the conflict?|`|uyfFGeMsaa	The whole purpose of establishing a Jewish majority state is to provide Jews with a safe haven where they would not be a minority at the mercy of a non-Jewish majority.  History has shown that Jews have been persecuted in almost every country, and the murderous rage of the whole Arab world against the Jews is not likely to dissipate if the Jews are foolish enough to trust their fate to an Arab majority that they deceive themselves into thinking is a democracy.    To put it simply, the "one state solution" is one in which the Arabs slaughter the Jews, as they have been saying all along they'd do if they ever got the chance.  It's pretty much identical to the Nazis' "final solution".    This is the taped message from a Hamas suicide bomber:    "My message to the loathed Jews is that there is no god but Allah, we will chase you everywhere! We are a nation that drinks blood, and we know that there is no blood better than the blood of Jews. We will not leave you alone until we have quenched our thirst with your blood, and our children's thirst with your blood. We will not leave until you leave the Muslim countries."  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82DqXmvDX...    THAT'S what's wrong with the "one state solution" delusion.  You suggest that the Jews invite this guy and all his pals into their living room for tea and democracy?    I don't think so.    Right now, this monster is a hero in Gaza.  The people of Gaza are not fit to be neighbors, sorry.  There may come a time when this sort of thing is universally reviled among Palestinians.  I'm not holding my breath.  In the meanwhile, Israel is wise to build a wall to keep out these people and their bomb vests and their psychopathic culture that's founded on grievance accumulation and revenge.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	Israel won the war of independence , it does not have to go backwards.Arabs in Israel are full citizens , those in the Palestinian territories are a different matter. They  want  a separate state or another Arab state in place of Israel. Anyway it was tried (1 state solution)under the Palestine mandate. The  British  and the Arabs severely restricted the immigration  of Jews to Palestine during the Holocaust. Millions of Jews could of been saved if Israel (the Jewish state) existed back then.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	You mean like the equal rights Jews and Christians have in Muslim countries?     Oops.. that's right, Jews and Christians don't have equal rights in Arab or non-Arab Muslim countries anywhere in that region.     What you're suggesting though is what Israel offered the Arabs/Egyptians/Syrians who had migrated there prior to 1948. But most of them refused the offer because they want all of Israel, Gaza, Judea, and Samaria to be combined into one country governed by Islam.  If all three areas were combined today and everyone given the right to vote, it would become just that overnight.     We know this because approximately 41% of the total population of Israel consists of Jews and their offspring who were driven out Arab-Muslim and non-Arab-Muslim countries. So why should Israelis allow the same thing to take place in their country that has happened all over the Middle East?     Jewish populations 1948 - 2008    Arab-Muslim countries  Saudi Arabia - Judaism and Christianity are outlawed  Jordan - Jews are denied citizenship  Algeria - 140,000 - 0  Bahrain - 600 - 36  Egypt - 80,000 - >100  Iraq - 130,000 - >200  Lebanon - 20,000 - >100  Morocco - 265,000 - 5,230  Syria - 30,000 - >100  Yemen - 55,000 - >200    Non-Arab Muslim countries  Afghanistan - 5,000 - 1  Iran - 150,000 - 40,000  Pakistan 2,000 - 0  Turkey - 80,000 - 30,000  The Nazi Imperialist mentality of the Muslims in that region is why such a plan would never be accepted.  -------  Edit: Frankie, I don't know where you got your information but approximately 17% of the population of Israel (approx. 1,200,000) are Arabs (1.7% are Arab Christians the rest are Muslims) and they have the same rights everyone else has in Israel. That's just slightly more than the number of Jews that were expelled from Arab countries (approx. 1,025,000). So please save your false claims of Arabs being victimized by Israel.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	The one state solution would be like putting fire and gasoline together it will just create one big explosion. Both sides are filled with extremists and putting them together would actually intensify the conflict as both sides will just do pograms against each other. It would not be a fair peace deal because it gives too much consession to the Palestinians and not enough to the Israelis and a truly effective peace solution has to benefit both sides equally.

You have to pay a fee to leave it parked there for a certain number of days. They usually have security guards around the parking garage so its safe. Also if something were to happen if you be their responsibility since you paid them to care for your car.|`|6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	1.

They are about $8.00 0 $10.00 a day; a  few dollars less per day than the airport long term.  One of them is Park N Save.  There are others.  Just Google Miami Airport Parking.

XfjAwH7Haa	You won't find any GOOD skiing anywhere in Canada in sept. Whistler is on the other side of the planet from Toronto. Toronto could be more than +30C outside. We don't get snow in most of Canada until Nov and thats if we are lucky. May I suggest doing something that you would do in summer, just a question, where are you coming from? Can I guess you are American.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Toronto, and Ontario generally, can be quite warm, even hot, in September. I don't think there's anywhere in Canada you can ski in September. Maybe there's some snow in the Arctic by then, but most areas are still pretty warm. Whistler doesn't usually open until some time in November. There's snow on the higher mountains in BC then but they don't have ski hills.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I just spent 10 years living in the Blue Mountain area which is about 2 hours north of Toronto.  I'm 100% certain that you will not find any skiing in any place in Ontario in September.  In September I was still wearing short sleeves and shorts.  For the most part there was not any decent skiing, even at Blue Mountain, till mid to late November in the best of years.|`|056cd57fe1506567da3828f5884632ecaa	Ooh. Skiing is pretty unlikely in September near Toronto. There aren't any REAL mountains (just "ski hills"), and September is warm, so there isn't any snow!     Glen Eden is close, but in September there is still swimming. No snow! Same with Blue Mountain.     Apparently Whistler has glacier skiing, but it is ridiculously far from Toronto (like a 3-4 hour PLANE ride. And an expensive one too!). I can't think of anywhere in Ontario where you would be able to ski in September.|`|5c6671e8f478958f34681c2f7e863dc2aa	You will not find any skiing anywhere around Toronto (Blue Mountain - which is not really that near Toronto - or otherwise) in September.  In the fall, Toronto and area still has temps in the 70s and even 80s sometimes, and Toronto and all the surrounding area is very flat.  The "Collingwood" area of Ontario has skiing, but I would say probably into at least November.  Whistler is in B.C., thousands of miles away.  In Quebec, Mt. Tremblant, etc., you may find skiing, but not as early as September.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	no where near toronto will have snow in sept,  it gets very hot there at that time of year|`|qdWLHHTHaa	try blue mountain.... but sept in bet u wouldnt find any snow out there..|`|Dd14BZncaa	Australia

pcHp7Dgkaa	The pictures are genuine but there are many, many better beaches in Australia than those two. I'm happy for Manly and the Gold Coast to be the most famous so that the really good places are left for Australians and tourists who like to get off the beaten track. I haven't seen or heard of any better beaches in the US though I guess it's possible that you have some hidden away.     The US has many fantastic and beautiful places and the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls (shared with Canada and tourist tacky but still magnificent), New England in Fall, Washington State, the Rockies, NYC and many other places are just as good and sometimes better than anything we have in Australia. It must be said though, that the combination of our great climate, our beautiful natural environment, our relaxed lifestyle and the equality of opportunity here make Australia a paradise for even very ordinary working people. The US is beautiful and exciting and rich (well, it used to be), but it's not a paradise for vast numbers of its people.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	The Caribbean, there are some beautiful out of the way beaches in Florida, especially gulf coast.

I have stayed at both the Portland Square Hotel (right off Times Square) and, more recently, Herald Square Hotel (approximately 5th Ave. and 31st).  These are sister hotels and the Herald is a little nicer than the Portland, but both are reasonable and convenient to all the attractions.  Check out their websites.
4m8jryUmaa	I think if you buy your ticket online you go up to the counter at the station and they give you a real ticket. You don't need to get there super early (I've done it a few times and I always get there early anyway). Or if you haven't bought a ticket, you would have to buy it there. If you look at your route it should tell you how often the bus stops, because it differs. On a two hour trip it might stop two or three times. So for 500 miles you're looking at a lot of stops.     Definitely bring food and drink, but be aware that you are in a tight space so don't bring anything that smells very much/at all. Also be aware that the people around you might smell bad. Bring headphones/earplugs. Make sure to dress comfortably and bring a blanket and pillow!|`|KEbn0z4uaa	well a 500 miles tirp in a grey hound is sorta uncomfortable and the bathroom kinda smell lol. it's safe.    just to be sure 30 mins early. yes it is the same as a check in in the airport. you need ticket and maybe ur id and they might have u fill out a tag for ur suite cases 2 max!    it's makes alot of stop pit and 30 mins to eat and u can have food and drink.    have some music some sort of entertainment!   good luck on ur trip hope this helped since i do like alot of traveling|`|006d3fb083d9c813ff6736eb9009149caa	I used to travel from Philadelphia back home to NYC when I was away at college. I neevr experienced anything that made me question safety standards. I used to try to get to the station about an hour early. But, you really dont have to be there that early. Just in case, though. If you already have your ticket, if you purchased online, you can just go straight to the gate. I always had my ticket in advance, so I don't know about the process of buying it on the same day.  You can eat and drink (just nothing alcoholic), they don't care.  The most times a bus has stopped when I was on it was twie, going upstate. It depends on the length of your trip.|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	There is no long check in like at the airport. 15-20 minutes before departure should be enough. There are no reserved seats on a Greyhound, it's a first come basis. They stop for lunch about every 5-6 hours. You can bring snacks & soda, but as stated nothing that has an odor stronger than some of your fellow passengers. Don't leave valuables on the bus when at the lunch breaks, they might disappear. And if possible sit near the front of the bus. You're less likely to get motion sickness up front, and the air smells better there too.  If your journey is going to be in the southwest understand that some of Greyhound's routes are contracted to Mexican based bus companies. Go online and put in the information about your trip. On the schedules page look for a carrier code of "GLI". That will be a Greyhound bus driven by a Greyhound trained and employed driver. Good luck on your trip.|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	Best advice i can give you is be aware, don't get stabbed, and there is a metal detector and that is your check in plus you go to a counter and show your ticket and that's it

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Motorhomes are a cross between buying a car and a house.  There is no base cost.  We are talking did you pick the carpet and the granite countertops or the laminate?    Like a car, it's completely depending on the make and model.  Motorhomes are also sold in feet so you'll need to figure out how many feet you want.  Winnabago ranges from about 60K-300,000.  Monarch run way more than that.    Plus like a car, a used one is worth less.  You could also consider just buying a popup.  That would be much smaller.    Roughly buying one used is about 30-50K. Renting one for 6 months would probably be a fair amount too though I have no idea how much.  I don't know if you can rent for 6 months, long term rental like that.

nFV0LAudaa	You can withdraw as much money as you want, since they don't care if you are a green card holder in your native country, well I don't think they will even ask in the first place. The only limit is how much you can bring into the country if you are flying into the states. I remember it was $10,000 as the limit, if more they will question you why you are bringing so much money into the country. Hope that helps.
yOxhQQnJaa	From Atlanta to Virginia Beach should be an 8-11 hr drive. This depends on how often you stop, summer time construction, etc.    As for flying, I'm afraid that I can't help you much, other than it should take about the same: 11 hrs. That's due to layover's, etc. I do know that to fly from Miami, Florida to Seattle, WA takes 8 hrs. So, it's approximately the same from Paris to Atlanta 8-11 hrs.

In fact, there's a good chance on the day this record-breaking temperature was recorded by a meteorological station in El Azizia in 1922 there were other places hundreds of miles away that were even hotter. In all likelihood, this record temperature has been exceeded since then in many places on earth, but we have no official records of the temperatures. It is important to note that when atmospheric temperatures are recorded it is not the surface temperature, where it can sometimes reach 150 F/ 66 C, but rather the air temperature at about 5 feet (1.6 m) above the surface in an enclosed shelter. Of course, it's important that the temperature sensor is not exposed to direct sunlight - the shelter is louvered to permit air flow across the sensor. Most humans don't 'hang out' where some of the hottest tempertatures on earth are regularly experienced so there aren't a lot of meterological stations in these places to reliably record extreme temperatures.|`|o0QVfQJgaa	Honolulu, Hawaii|`|eVqeIqtCaa	tanjung rambutan

There are around a dozen little ones on the beach  that frankly probably are not up to your standards, but they are right on the beach.......Even the Malibu Beach Inn (one of the most expensive with 47 rooms and around $300 per night) ) is only OK compared to what you are probably used to. They are kinda like little Bed and Breakfast type places with few rooms and less services...CHECK THE EXACT LOCATION before you make a reservation. A lot of hotels far up in the hills and hill towns claim to be Malibu hotels because they want to use the name.

GHTDunLMaa	Lufthansa or Air France? Their are both national air carriers known for punctuation (especially Lufthansa)  and services typical for airlines of their size.    Now, it all depends upon which route you will fly, airplane serving the route (newer or older), starting point.....    On international flight Lufthansa still use Boeing 747-400's, and some A-330, 340 and 350. Till recently, entertainment consisted of listening to radio...... They are now introducing latest front seat IFE's with touchscreen on majority of international routes.     In that aspect, Air France has had more to offer, but Lufthansa is getting better lately.    If you are fan of airline cuisine, then you wont fail if you chose Air France.    Airports in Germany are not far better organized then those in France, and better option regarding connecting flights.|`|AA11496012	Both are good airlines and I would not have a problem flying either one.  You can check http://www.seatguru.com to find out the seat width and pitch.  I would also consider the departure and arrival time to help decide which airline offers a more convenient time.  Is there a big price difference on tickets between the airlines?  Finally are you have a frequent flier account with a particular airline?  Air France is in the SkyTeam Alliance and Lufthansa is part of the Star Alliance.  So if you have a frequent flier account with say Delta or KLM, I would choose Air France because you can earn Delta or KLM miles.  If you have a British Midlands or United Airlines frequent flier account, I would choose Lufthansa.  Both SkyTeam and Star Alliance have numerous members.  You can go to their websites to find a list of all member airlines.|`|23b69e7f8073aa893274935eee6f43ceaa	To be honest, they're both decent airlines.  I would have a slight preference for Lufthansa for a couple of reasons - changing in Frankfurt or Munich is easier than Paris for example.  Their overall experience is slightly better too, but not by much - Air France is still a decent airline.  I've actually had a pretty crappy meal on Air France but for me, the quality of the food would not prevent me from flying an airline again - and I've had good meals on both airlines..  The most important thing is being reliable and having overall decent (or good) service, and both of these airlines are fine.  I would go with whichever is cheaper and/or has the most convenient schedule.|`|JocRA3jhaa	ive nt been on air france but i have been on lufthansa  was very comfie n pleasant

True Torah Jews is a non-profit organization founded by a group of Orthodox Jews dedicated to informing the world, and the American public and politicians in particular, that the ideology of Zionism is in total opposition to the teachings of traditional Judaism.     So he is a part of a group that think differently, so what.|`|B3FBgxjEaa	A friend of mine, Rabbi Isidor Abulafia said: There are a number of reasons why "palestine" should never come into existence. The historical reality is that Jewish rights supercede arab and muslim rights to the land. This is merely a brief summary of the facts.      In the first place there never historically had been a sovereign state of palestine, it was a British territory and prior to that part of the Ottoman empire. For that matter most of the arab states, artificial creations which were carved from out of the defeated Ottoman empire after WW1 by the colonial powers, actually have no right to exist. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and and all the gulf states.      Another fact to mention is that an arab state already was carved out of 76% of mandatory Palestine, and that of course is Jordan, originally named transjordan given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.      The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "palestinians", Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so who's territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied, they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense. Yet even Israel itself and its supporters have bought into this false narrative of Israel being an occupier.       Another point to be made is that the creation of a palestinian state will not only fail to bring peace, but will result in the creation of another terrorist entity. Why on Earth does the west want to create this terrorist state when we are supposed to be fighting a war against islamic terrorism? As it is, the hamas run PA is imposing sharia law on the population, Christians are being threatened and persecuted, resulting in many of them fleeing. When Israel surrendered Gaza in the summer of '05, rather than trying to build a viable state, the palestinians looted and destroyed the greenhouses that were given to them by wealthy and generous Jewish Americans who had bought them from the former Jewish residents of Gaza. And let's not leave out the fact that anarchy and chaos is the order of the day as hamas and fatah factions shoot and kill each other (a good thing as far as Israel is concerned), as well as various clans, tribes and militas controlling the streets. These people have not shown that they are capable whatsoever of running a peaceful, viable state. So why should they get one? If anyone in the Middle East deserves its own state, it is the Kurds, who have proven they can run a peaceful, viable state. But the international community isn't clamoring to create one for them.      And finally, a state of palestine would create a terrorist base for Syria and Iran, which already supplies the various terrorist entities with money, arms missiles and so forth.       For all of these reasons and more, there is no logical reason that a palestinian state should be created. As long as the arab muslim world remains mired in a medieval barbaric culture of hatred and death, Israel and the rest of the free world must make no concessions to it whatsoever.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Well that is his opinion and people can say what they want but a naysayers opinion doesn't make it so.

"What more proof does one need than the fact that for centuries, Jews have lived peacefully in Arabic countries, enjoying the respect and friendship of their neighbors?"    Dhimmi status is peaceful........ok.......    "Zionism was deviously designed to replace the Torah and its holy, God-given commandments with nationalistic, power-driven ideals that are devoid of holiness, godliness, or spirituality."    That is not true, most of the zionists knew the torah and knew parts of the talmud such as Ben Gurion and Menachem Begin. Shimon Peres grew up religious. There are others. Zionism was designed to find a safe haven for European Jews. Now it became a safe haven for middle eastern Jews. Oddly enough, Zionism failed at its attempt. Most european jews, russian and polish did not want to live in Israel because it was not easy.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	The ideas printed here belong to a lunatic fringe group called Neturei Karta.    The Neturei Karta, a tiny splinter group, has been condemned by every other Jewish group, from the non-religious to the very religious.

3LmXfFoBaa	I was born in Kingsport, went to grad school in johnson city, and have tons of family out around lenoir city. So, I guess that makes me a mountain man--even though I live in Connecticut today, blah.    Its so beautiful, and its rich in culture. The land/property is fairly inexpensive. The weather is four season but not terribly extreme in any one. The towns are tight knit usually, revolving around county fairs and prep sports. The public education is not bad either, but this depends on where you live--the Tri-Cities are actually very well educated, including Carter , Washington and Sullivan counties.    Politically speaking, its Christian Libertarian. Look into the sale tax--its about 9% but thats because they have few other taxes. Again, it libertarian.    If I could just live any where on the planet, it would be along the outskirts of Johnson City, like Gray (TN) or anywhere in Carter County, especially Elizabethton. Its a really nice place to live. You are not far from the airport, Johnson CIty is right there for anything you need, and you're an hour away from Knoxville as well as Asheville (NC), the latter being the coolest small city stateside.    Avoid Kingsport--thats where Eastman Kodak is located--unless you are living outside in Sullivan County. Sevier County is full of tourist traps but is loads of fun in every direction. The Chattanooga area, like Lee, is super-hyper-Conservative...I mean I was raised Baptist, and they even scare me at times, lol. Chattanooga itself is amazing, however. Don't drink the water in Oak Ridge--Y12 is located there, yeah my uncle and his buddies who worked at Y12 all died of cancer, go figure. Knoxville is nice to visit, but do not live in it...why would you move to the hills and live in a place like the Hill (a reference to the University of Tennessee, which is sprawled throughout the city itself)?    I recommend the Tri-Cities, though I am biased having grown up there. Darn, I miss 'em. Go see the Smokies. Hike Buffalo Gap. Drive around Johnson City and visit Elizabethton or Jonesborough. Download some Everybody Fields. Go to Bristol and dance at the Carter family fold. Also tune in online to the local NPR station from East Tennessee State; the link is below.

I would have to say that Nashville is my favorite place in Tennessee.  I live in far north-west TN near the KY line.  It is VERY rural, but hospitable.  The summer weather tends to be very warm and can be muggy at times.  Tennessee displays the best spring and fall colors imaginable!  The winters are normally tame, but you will definitely get a chance to see some snow.      I will have to agree with an earlier post in that it is a very religious state with predominantly conservative values.  The largest cities are Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville/Chattanooga.  These cities are in West, Middle and East Tennessee, respectively.  It is very pretty in East TN with all of the mountains - especially in the fall.  Nashville is lovely with the river views and the energetic nightlife.  Memphis is rooted in history from the Blues to Elvis.  Memphis is a bit dodgy these days, so if you have a family - it might not be the best idea to live near downtown.  They are making great efforts to clean these issues up, but living 20 minutes or so outside of downtown Memphis is close enough to the action, but far enough away to enjoy the perks of a rural neighborhood.  Overall, Tennessee is a lovely state with a 'at home' feel.  I love living here.
vFHXrOHNaa	Most people who are overweight up 300Lbs fit in to the little economy seats easily in most carriers.    Carriers I like:    United, American, Jet Blue for Domestic    American, Singapore Airlines, KLM and Lufthansa for International.    If you want a wider seat you can splurge about twice as much and get a First Class Ticket for Domestic Travel.    Good Luck.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Seats in First Class and Business Class are always larger and more comfortable, in addition to being more expensive.  Personally, if I had a choice between purchasing two seats in Coach Class or one seat in First, I would go with First even if the price were the same -- food and service are much better!    I really don't know the answers to your other questions, but am sure that if a seat belt extender is needed they will have it available.  I suggest you contact a travel agent for advice with your other concerns.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You need to go online and type in airline tickets, and the airline you are closest to. the sites like expedia.com, .kayak.com, cheapflightseats.com are best. They will give you the cheapest flights.    Yes, you have to buy two seats if you don't properly fit in your seat. The best are the seats near the emergency door.    I would advice you contact the airport or airline and ask regarding weight/seats.    I would not go with Southwest. Look at the show Airline and you will find out that that airline is not popular with customer service.  Delta, American Airlines are both great.    May I ask, what do you weigh?

The cheaper way is to fly business class. The seats are much bigger. I have never seen people who couldn't fit in a first/class or business seat.  The airline is not as much of a factor as the PLANE it's self. Some airliners have bigger seats because they are intended for long hauls.  If I were you, I'd go into an American Express office where they can answer all of question for EACH flight!  Have a nice time!

Which in English means, "even a poor man has his pride".    Pride is not exclusive to the rich.  It is a quality present in all human beings.  More apparent when one is poor.  No one likes to be poor; no one likes to see himself living a miserable and a destitute life.  And understandably, an impoverished man is ashamed of his social and financial status in life.  That is a natural reaction.      Is there pride in poverty?  Some would say no.  It is something shameful.  A stigma of one's failures, of one's pitiful roots.  Others would say yes - there is pride in being poor.  No one wants to be financially incapacitated.  However, pride in being poor comes knowing one is not idle, one is not breaking laws or rules or, one has integrity - a respectable person despite one's social status, respecting others as well.|`|AvKwr0ZSaa	Yes, if we are going to see it on the spiritual meaning of poverty.

94b8KImYaa	No.   How do you come up with that idea ?   Because it is called Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and your dictionary tells you that Tauber is the German word of a deaf person ?   In this case Tauber is a river.   Rothenburg ob der Tauber means Rothenburg oberhalb der Tauber which in English would be: Rothenburg above the Tauber.     More info on Rothenburg can be found via the link below|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	LOL    Partly yes, but it's not that they live "Ob der Tauber" ("taub" means "deaf" in German, for all those not so familiar with the language). In Rothenburg, and in many small medieval cities in Germany,common culture is very traditional, and elderly people are, although good at hearing, very foreigner-unfriendly and unwilling to understand foreign dialects or languages, which MIGHT appear to foreigners as if they were deaf, but in fact, they aren't. There is an easy way to check if a granny walks in front of you or blocks a supermarket aisle and to check for her deafness: Use a thing that's known in German as a "Schiedsrichterpfeife", a soccer referee's whistle. Blow it gently: If Granny jumps, her hearing is excellent.|`|He90d9Dqaa	There are not more deaf citizens in Rotenburg than in every other city all over the world.|`|mdc7f5zyaa	No, I live in Rothenburg ob der Tauber and Im not deaf.

Ic8FLXm5aa	The villages shown in the video were taken out by Israeli bulldozers. They are a punitive measure. I can't say I agree with it though. It is essentially collective punishment but I can be wrong. Although unrealistic, here is how you fix this situation. Hamas and Fatah cannot rule because of their corruption. The same goes for the Israeli gov't. Take away or replace both gov't and take out the settlers out of the west bank or exchange land. Create a tunnel connecting gaza and west bank. The idea of a refugee return cannot be done though. The law states that anyone who lived in the british mandate of palestine at least two years is a refugee. This doesn't take immigrants into account or other situation. Just create a 2 state solution with 2 states and one gov't in each state. Unfortunately, this cannot happen because the gov't of both states will be permanent.

There is no doubt that Israel is playing for keeps and are intent on destroying any part of Gaza that was used to launch rockets.    Over 6000 rockets have been launched since 2002 from school grounds and villages.    At this stage about 10 villages have suffered significant damage from bulldozers and bombs including some on the Egyptian border where tunnels were constructed.

6fPfKfLVaa	Palestine.    My add on:  As I read the replies that others have given, I feel I must expand on my answer.  I support Palestine because they were promised their state while Israelis were promised one as well.  It was agreed that Palestine would be allowed to have the West Bank & conduct its own elections (ie: be its own entity).  The same for Israel.  Now, can you please tell me why are Jewish settlers moving & HAVE BEEN moving into the West Bank when they know that this is supposed to be Palestinian land.  Why is the Israeli government tearing down Palestinian houses?  If Israel wants peace, then they need to support peace.  You cannot claim that the Palestinians are not peaceful when you are taking over land that Israel AGREED to give to them & you sure as heck can't knock down their homes.  I don't support the killing of innocent people - what Israel is doing is terrorism.  And if that is not enough, they have used phosphorous bombs against the Palestinian people - most of which are women and children.   So, you ask me if I support Israel.  NEVER.  Israel's actions go against the Geneva convention & they are going back on their agreement that allowed for Palestinian land.  As long as they continue this selfish act, there will never be peace in that region.  And my last point: if God had promised the Jews this land - would He have wanted them to kill innocent women and children for it?  I don't think so.  That is against what God is and Israel is going against God for their own personal gain.  There is a better way to live in what you consider to be "your" land without killing those in it.|`|vHQsz8HHaa	I support Palestine|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	I support now more then ever , Israel.Its the only country the Jewish people have, its been theres for over 3000 years.

They already got their Arab Palestinian state when Jordan was created, after which they expelled 95% of the Jews (approx. 1,025,000) out of every Arab country in the Middle East.     None of these people ever claimed to be "Palestinians" until after they lost the Six Day War. There is not one legal document dated prior to 1967 that states someone's nationality as being "Palestinian" That's because there has never been such a nation or nationality.     The Arabs/Egyptians/Syrians, etc in the Gaza Strip, Samaria, and Judea need to go find one of the 57 countries now controlled by the Arab Imperialists and their ilk and make their homes there. They have no right or authority to control the entire Middle East and they certainly have no right or authority to control the Holiest land known to the Jewish people. They wouldn't stand for anyone trying to take over Mecca so there should be no arguments about handing what belongs to Israel back over to Israel, meaning ALL of Israel, including ALL of Samaria, ALL of Judea, and ALL of Jerusalem.

There is no country called Palestine and there never was.   I will assume that you mean  Who do you support? Israel's right to exist or the right of the arab refugees from Palestine to self rule.    The answer to that question is.  Both.  I support Israel because it has a right to exist and a responsibility to protect it's citizens. I support the right of the arab refugees to self rule.  The elected Hamas and now they have to live with having a government that is a terrorist movement and is not recognized by the world.     The real victims are the Palestinian refugees who do not support Hamas, they get it from 2 sides.

Speaking on behalf of All Arab Muslims, Christians and Jews who live in Palestine (hence to the people who have no clue what Palestine is, look at a map prior 1948 and you will see that the country known today as Israel was Palestine), all we want is what is rightfully ours. Palestinians are killed off daily because they roam the land that Israel has been trying to forcefully take for years now. Israel does not belong to the Jews. It is Palestine, stolen land that belongs to the Arab. Stolen land that Jews created to be their own because Palestinians welcomed them there during harsh times such as the Christian Crusades and Hitler's rule. Here's footage of an Israeli rabbi who states that in the Jewish faith, Jews are said not to have their own country. How were the Palestinians supposed to know that if they lent a helping hand their land and homes would be taken from them?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udm0xEfCf...    I am for the Palestinians.

oThKwCw4aa	since I lived in Tehran I adore it and feel at home whenever I go to Tehran.no place is like Teharn although it is a very big and crowded city.... I love even the poluted air and I try to fill my lungs and smell the smoke as soon as I ge to the airport!! lol    Kish is a very nice place to visit but I can't imagine to live there during summer!!it is really hot and humid. but if you like that kind of weather it is A1....;) the gulf is very beautiful and the water is clear and blue.... and it is a very clean city.    Isfahan is also a very nice place and my second choice after Tehran would be Isfahan.It is rich on old buildings and historical places to visit specially from the safavid era...  shiraz is a bit too quiet for my taste but a very historical city.... and very interesting also specially the ruins from "Takhte jamshid" (persepolis) and apadana and the pre islamic era places build ....  Tabriz  and Urumie are worth visiting too from the qajars are many bulidings left ....and the weather is cool and fresh during summer.

AA12350023	well having a modest amount to achieve the goals you want isnt bad. Im from a middle working class household and I am happy..I can get what I want if I save and work for it.. So no problem.. I just prioritize my things a bit differently than a wealthy person would..  I do have many wealthy friends, from varying degrees of wealth, from having a bit, to stinkingly wealthy.. and they actually have more problems than I do.. I didnt realize this until I became an adult.. All my wealthy friends while growing up, I felt jealous of.. but once I became an adult, seemed like money caused problems.. More adultery, more divorce, more arguments. I dont know why..   All my really wealthy friends seem to have more marrital problems than I...   The ones that can pop in a plane and fly to Europe at a whim, they all are complaining all day long.. Why? I would love to go on a vacation when i wanted..   I am forced to save up and only get a vacation every 3rd year or so.. But I am happy.. I think when you actually work for something, it means so much more to you than if you get it handed to you..|`|cypZ0ykXaa	ofcourse yes!! but "NOT ALL THE TIME". its just in few cases we can buy happiness.tahtz waht i feel|`|dp2Rocjraa	can money buy happiness ?     well , the definition of the word " happiness " is different from one person to another , for me for instance happiness comes when treasuring those preshuse moments in life , sometimes from the simple everyday routine you have , like watching ur brothers and sisters playing together , or sharing a conversation with my parents , or even making mistakes that you will later on will learn from in life ..    to others it might mean being able to have everything you want , a certain kind of car , a beach house ,, and on and on ,,, for those money will probably buy "happiness" .    but to be fare ,some goals and accomplishments do need money to achieve them , in order of being happy .  so in my opinion money can buy "happiness" , but not necessarily the right kind of " happiness " .|`|kgNkuNOJaa	Money is an alternative...its like a side dish for our meal...without it, life wouldn't be so easy to gulp !!|`|Bc3WOgUYaa	Well sometimes when u really need it, it counts but to some ppl money isnt happiness.|`|QI2OxkImaa	I knew a girl who was selling happiness|`|K2bpyDVsaa	It all depends on what you want really.

The Palestinians and other Muslims routinely accuse Israel of threatening their holy places in Jerusalem and have discovered that this is a good way to provoke local violence and international condemnation. The tactic goes back to the 1920s when the Mufti of Jerusalem made similar charges that provoked widespread rioting. The latest example of using this method of incitement (which violates the road map and Oslo agreements) came when Sheikh Mohammad Hussein, the director of the Al-Aksa Foundation, accused Israel of excavating under the Temple Mount with the intention of destroying the Al-Aksa mosque.    As in the past, the charge is a total fabrication. The most recent construction involved the development of a new visitors center built around new findings excavated near the Western Wall. Discoveries at the new site include a ritual bath from the period of the second Jewish Temple, destroyed in 70 C.E., and a wall archaeologists say dates to the first Jewish Temple, destroyed in 586 B.C.E.160 The work was done in the already tunnel area that has now been open to tourists for several years. It is not underneath the Temple Mount and nowhere near the Al-Aksa mosque. What really bothers the sheikh is that the center will show a fabricated heritage that might help them to deceive foreign visitors into believing Jerusalem as a historical place of the Jews....     Israel denied the accusations, but official government denials rarely satisfy those who are ready to believe any libel emanating from the Palestinian Authority. In this case, however, UPI reporter Joshua Brilliant attended the Foundation press conference during which a misleading film was shown purporting to prove the charges. Brilliant independently investigated the tunnel and found no evidence of any excavation in the direction of the mosque. A Hamas website nevertheless said that a synagogue was under the mosque and We will spill blood and offer souls in defense of the mosque.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	No Israel protects all Jewish ,Muslim, Christian, Baha'i Druze and any other religious sites within its border|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	Yet ANOTHER paranoid Arab delusion.

This is not supported by the general population in Israel and the Israeli government and police do not support such action.

But they are just claims and there is never any evidence to validate those claims. They are often just attempts to provoke violence or prevent Israeli's from uncovering archeological artifacts that verify Israel is their Holy Land.    There is however more than sufficient evidence of a concerted effort by Muslims in Jerusalem to destroy any and all of the archeological evidence of the former Jewish Temples.

The Israelis know for a fact that Al Aqsa being there is mere proof that Jerusalem as well as the rest of "Israel" belongs to the Palestinians. They are currently digging underneath the Aqsa to try and find some sort of proof that the Temple of Solomon existed there but they have found nothing. They don't want to destroy it because every Muslim country in the world would demolish Israel for that, but they want to claim it, so to speak as where their Temple was.    FACT: Al Aqsa Mosque was built 3 times in the same spot it is today....The first time it was built was by the Prophet Adam (PBUH). This is what Muslims believe and have always been told from the beginning of time. Muslims pray 5 times a day towards Mecca, but before Mecca they prayed towards Al Aqsa.    God Himself destroyed the Temple of Solomon the moment Jews executed your Lord and Savior.|`|e488c78b0404e0d573309d30166d7451aa	Gosh! I dont hope so... and honestly, I dont think that it is true. Because the Ajsa Mosque is a real symbol of Jerusalem and it is a sacred place for many people.   And it is as well human patrimony.    I mean it makes no sense at all, because if this was true, they would also have in mind to destroy all religious places of Christianity and as far as I am informed, Israel does protect these places.  Dont start to get paranoid. Nobody will ever destruct one of the symbols of Jerusalem.   I get nervous when I hear things like that, because destroying religious signs is really awful, such thing made by the Talibans when they destroyed the Buddha statues.   Israel will never do such thing, because Israel does respect the history and all sacred places.  And not mention that Israel is a democracy and its absolutely impossible that a democracy blows away any religious building for any other religious ideas. Israel is a non-religious country.   By the way, in Palestine they do not respect the Christian churches a lot, right? And what I got to know from people who had literally to flee from Palestine not because of Israel has done something to them, but because of being mistreated by the Muslim majority because of being Christians but I am not talking about looking badly at them or just insulting them. I talk about beating them up and things like that and they were really afraid of their lives.   I guess you dont want to know how these nice Muslim neighbours treated the women of this family for not covering up and silly stuff like this?   So you post this question trying to convince us that Israelis are religious fanatics while they are not and you are not able to see that the only ones who do not respect any other religious belief among them are the majority of the Muslim Palestine.   Israel has nothing against Muslims in general or against Palestine in particular  But indeed, Israel does not approve these terror groups who want to blow them away and its them who do not respect others who are different.  Get this into your head please.   In Israel there do live many Israeli Arabs as well and nobody does discriminate them because of their religion.   Israel fights terrorism and not religions.   And although it does not go with this question I want to point out that I am against any war where innocents are killed, but I strongly support any action which eliminates these who are guilty for all this misery, the terrorists.|`|eyJqrqn7aa	No the only reason to do so would be to rebuild the Temple and no one is asking for that yet.

LA covers a very large area. So there are 100s of neighborhoods. Also you have to consider what city you will be working in. Traffic is definitely a constant here.
kgBPU4xxaa	Siena is a great place to visit. The old town is pretty extensive. The Duomo and Baptistry are both worth visiting and just walking around the the old town admiring the architecture is interesting. There are some good shops. The main square is encircled with restaurants and shops and features a very nice fountain and an extremely tall tower.    Things to do depend on exactly when you're there. Twice a year, there's a horse race in the square attended by a lot of pagentry with people in medieval costume. The square isn't flat and there are some sharp turns. The last time I was there, there was a big multicultural festival in the old town which was very interesting. It covered many blocks of the city and featured food, music, exhibits and merchandise from a lot of different countries around the world.    If you go behind the tower to the Mercato area, you can look down into a valley. There's a garden there with a good restaurant - Orto di Pece.    There's a small shopping center down by the train station now too.|`|3fHZOobiaa	I live in Florence that is quite close to Siena, and I've been there sometimes ...

I also had to roll my suitcase thru the cobbled streets as I didn't have anywhere to put it! THe town is on rolling hills...and there are some good views of the town and surrounding area at a few sites due to the up and down nature.   There is a nice duomo( bascialla) but as there were a number of steps uphill to get to it..i had to admire it from outside.  The town has a medieval feel to it, so all the buildings are stone and have a neat look. There is a roman ampitheatre with a tall building...there is something significant about it in being the largest and tallest somethings. This is the centre of town...there are a few nice churches too.  Its a lovely town and well worth seeing...the countryside around it is also nice.  I stayed in a town called monetpulciano which is one of the hillside villages in the siena region and is lovely with great views of the surrounding area. You can get a bus from Siena ( although I missed this and took a train to chusi and then got a bus there!!! it added to the fun of that day))|`|KI56y9gmaa	We spent the day there in May and had a fantastic time.  It is a gorgeous city with great history.  The bell tower is really tall and was added to the church years after it was built and is really incredible.  Rick and Steve's guide to Italy gives the name of a great little restaurant just off the piazza.  We will go back on our next trip.  We were staying in a villa at Farneta which is fairly close and made the drive easily.

LUL9WNR7aa	The weather is nice.  Some days in the winter are cloudy, but most of the time it is sunny and mild to warm.  I understand that it gets very hot in the summer, but the spring and fall are beautiful.  I just moved here in October, so I don't have a whole years' experience with the weather.    I think it would be a good place for a single woman.  I moved here with my boyfriend.  There are plenty of opportunities to meet people - from bars and music joints to hiking trails and theaters.  If you are shy about approaching people, go to meetup.com and join some groups that interest you.    Good luck!

1v3LFI89aa	American biscuits with honey.In American English, a "biscuit" is a small form of bread made with baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent rather than yeast. (Biscuits, soda breads, and corn bread, among others, are sometimes referred to collectively as "quick breads" to indicate that they do not need time to rise before baking.)    Biscuits are extremely soft and similar to scones; in fact, many recipes are identical. In the United States, there is a growing tendency to refer to sweet variations as "scone" and to the savory as a "biscuit", though there are exceptions for both (such as the cheese scone). A sweet biscuit served with a topping of fruit and juice is called shortcake. In Canada, both sweet and savory are referred to as "biscuits", "baking powder biscuits" or "tea biscuits", although "scone" is also starting to be used.    Biscuits are a common feature of Southern U.S. cuisine and are often made with buttermilk. They are traditionally served as a side dish with a meal, especially in the morning. As a breakfast item they are often eaten with butter and a sweet condiment such as molasses, light sugarcane syrup, sorghum syrup, honey, or fruit jam or jelly. With other meals they are usually eaten with butter or gravy instead of sweet condiments. However, biscuits and gravy (biscuits covered in country gravy) are usually served for breakfast, sometimes as the main course.    A common variation on basic biscuits is "cheese biscuits", made by adding grated Cheddar or American cheese to the basic recipe.    Large drop biscuits, because of their size and rough exterior texture, are sometimes referred to as "cat head biscuits".    Biscuits are now ubiquitous throughout the U.S. and feature prominently in many fast food breakfast sandwiches. The biscuit sandwich burst onto the scene primarily through the Hardee's chain of restaurants as an answer to the McDonald's Egg McMuffin.[citation needed] Along with the traditional country ham, Hardee's added sausage, cheese, eggs, steak, and even chicken to the breakfast bread. Breakfast biscuits are much bigger than ham biscuits, most as big or bigger than a typical fast food hamburger. In addition, biscuits are commonly found as a side dish at fried chicken restaurants such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Bojangles', Church's Chicken, and Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits.      This link will give you a picture|`|wCL5abreaa	A biscuit is a roll. Not a hamburger roll, but a roll. It's a bread.  Good, too. Like, biscuits and gravy or chicken and biscuits.

I would suggest you look up a reciepe on line and make a small batch. but remember that it is an art. Truely great Biscuits are a food fit for the gods, and made by few.|`|AA11937736	A biscuit is a type of quick bread. It is made with just flour, shortening (lard is most authentic), baking powder, salt and water.    The ingredients are combined, the resulting dough is rolled out, cut into small circles and baked.    Here in the Southern United States (I live in Texas), biscuits are commonly eaten with breakfast and are often eaten split open and covered with a milk based gravy containing pork sausage.

GvJMM6u0aa	yo tuve la suerte de descubrirlo a loq 18 a?os y me marco profundamente, no es un libro para ni?os, por lo demas el autor lo insinua claramente antes de empezar    A Lon Werth.  Je demande pardon aux enfants d'avoir ddi ce livre  une grande personne. J'ai une excuse srieuse : cette grande personne est le meilleur ami que j'ai au monde. J'ai une autre excuse : cette grande personne peut tout comprendre, mme les livres pour enfants. J'ai une troisime excuse : cette grande personne habite la France o elle a faim et froid. Elle a besoin d'tre console. Si toutes ces excuses ne suffisent pas, je veux bien ddier ce livre  l'enfant qu'a t autrefois cette grande personne. Toutes les grandes personnes ont d'abord t des enfants. (Mais peu d'entre elles s'en souviennent.) Je corrige donc ma ddicace :  A Lon Werth quand il tait petit gar?on    que se traduce:    A LEON WERTH     Pido perdn a los ni?os por haber dedicado este libro a una persona mayor. Tengo una seria excusa: esta persona mayor es el mejor amigo que tengo en el mundo. Pero tengo otra excusa: esta persona mayor es capaz de comprenderlo todo, incluso los libros para ni?os.      Tengo una tercera excusa todava: esta persona mayor vive en Francia, donde pasa hambre y fro. Tiene, por consiguiente, una gran necesidad de ser consolada. Si no fueran suficientes todas esas razones, quiero entonces dedicar este libro al ni?o que fue hace tiempo esta persona mayor. Todas las personas mayores antes han sido ni?os.

If you are facing the Amtrak ticket desk, first go to your right, then left (before going up the ramp into the old part of the station... toward the south gates), and the lockers are on your left in the baggage claim area.  I don't know exactly how much they cost, it's been 5 years since I actually used them, but be sure to read all of the specifics about the price... When I first rented one, I didn't notice that the price was per HOUR, so I ended up spending a lot more than I'd intended while lollygagging around the station.      Oh, also, there are various sizes available.  I had a decent sized duffel bag and sweatshirt that I left in one with room to spare, and if I remember correctly there were some larger options.|`|AA10349376	There are no lockers at Union Station.
vcNUpjrYaa	Yeah, I'm a sophomore at Lane Tech right now and they have ROTC, but I have no clue what JROTC Raiders are. It's an option to choose either ROTC or PE. It's very rigorous and you have to wear those uniforms to school about once every two weeks or so. Other schools are Rickover, Phoenix, and that's about all I can think of. Talking to your school counselor would be best to find a school, but I would really encourage you to go to Lane Tech, it's a pretty good school. |`|IHHOHsMbaa	Before you join JROTC you better brush up on your English.

b61d886af315be700deb5ff41c372d68aa	That area is pretty sketchy. You are really close to Oak Park which is probably one of the worst neighborhoods in the whole town and my company does work at a shopping center at Stockton and Fruitridge that experiences a lot of crime and has a homeless problem. When I have to go there, I try not to get out of my car if possible.     There are some nice pockets of houses in the general area because doctors who work at the UCD med center have bought real estate on the cheap and renovated or moved in but in general its not someplace where I'm going to take an evening walk to the store. If you really want to live in this part of town, my advice would be to look west, closer to Curtis Park or north of the hospital and closer to downtown.

YvNCOYZZaa	You'll need a passport to get on the plane and to check into hotels.     You'll need cash to spend.     You'll need clothes, toiletries, shoes, etc.      I'd buy some guidebooks as well.  Fodor's are my fav.     I'd also buy pocket translation guides and practice things that you might need.  Like "Wo ist der Damentoilette?"  and "Dove  l'hotel Ambassador?"  and "Je ne mange pas des poissons" or whatever.      You also should have a wrap or a scarf to put on.  Italian Catholic churches will NOT permit you to enter them if you are showing your shoulders (tank top), chest (v-neck shirt), or knees (shorts or short skirts).      For entertainment, bring whatever you need to be entertained.  A good book, an ipod, whatever.      You may also want to bring an empty stainless steel water container so that you can refill it constantly.    You may want to bring adaptors if you are bringing any electronic equipment.     Since you are young, you should also bring a phone card with lots of money on it so that you can call home and touch base with your family.|`|LXZyqGiyaa	Box cutters.|`|OECroCMWaa	Here are some resources for traveling abroad, all of these helped me save time, weight, money and frustration.

I have traveled almost every state of Mexico and haven't had too much of a problem .  Sometimes the police are as bad as the criminals .  Don't wear jewelry and stay clear of bad areas at night .       Watch out for the guys who want to take you for a ride , because they treat 14 year old girls in Mexico the same way as an 18 year old in the U.S.                Don't get involved in ANY one's problem unless you want the same trouble .             For example , I watched a man try to help a drunk who fell in the street and police arrested both of them .               Don't assume everyone has good morals .  Some people are good and others are evil .  Many of the poor are just plain lazy and want to take advantage of you .

AA10411829	Yes. You need aU.S. issued passport to travel anywhere in the world outside of the U.S. and the Virgin Islands.  Passports usually take about 10-12 weeks after your application is put in to the U.S. Post Office or you can pay an expedited fee to make it faster.  Children's passports are somewhat less money.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	You most definately need a passport valid for at least 6 months to go anywhere outside the US. You however don't need a visa for most places in the world.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	To FLY anywhere outside the U.S. and its territories you must have a passport.  You will not be allowed on the airplane without it.  Until June 1, 2009, you may still travel by land to Canada or Mexico with just your birth certificate and photo I.D.  After that, you must have a passport.  You may go on cruises to Mexico and the Caribbean region with just your birth certificate and photo I.D.  See sites below.|`|kw8tu4Aiaa	It depends on where. See the source.|`|0tHYQHY7aa	I would have one. Maybe some places don't mind but there are many countries that expect a passport. I needed to show my passport when I traveled in Europe 6 years ago. It is better to be safe then sorry.|`|a86TSv5Caa	yup|`|FpT7x2VVaa	yes, in order to be allowed back home, you must have a passport if you fly. driving, you can get away until the summer without one.  here's the verbatim:    U.S. law requires that Americans entering the U.S. from Canada by air (including those returning by air from short trips to Canada ) must have a valid passport.   This requirement will be extended to sea travel (except closed loop cruises), including ferry service, and land travel by the Summer of 2008.   Until then, travelers entering the U.S. from Canada by sea and land must have government-issued photo identification and a document showing their U.S. citizenship (for example, a birth certificate or certificate of nationalization). Further information on upcoming changes to U.S. passport policy can be found on the Bureau of Consular Affairs web site at click here. We strongly encourage all American citizen travelers to apply for a U.S. passport well in advance of anticipated travel. American citizens can visit http://travel.state.gov or call 1-877-4USA-PPT (1-877-487-2778) for information on how to apply for their passports.|`|1F4ILBYVaa	There are a few places that you do not have to have a passport for.  You did not used to have to have one to visit Canada, from the US.  This however has changed, due to 9/11.    Even if it would happen to not be required.  You should carry one any time you cross any national boarder.  It is the universal ID.  Never leave it in your luggage..  and NEVER leave it in your hotel room.  Keep it in a locked safe when it is not permissible to keep it with you.  Also, keep a xerox copy of your passport and immunization papers with you, but stored seperate from your original.  It is also a good idea to leave a xerox copy of all these documents with a close friend or relative, back home in the US.  In the event they would have to fax you a copy.  Good luck.

nFV0LAudaa	I don't know about India, but the majority of the countries around the world require you to have a license as a travel guide/agent. If you don't have one its illegal to be a guide/agent, and most people won't use your service.    But one way to advertise yourself is to make a homepage, also you can advertise on craigslist or other travel forums for your services. This is the easiest way to find tourists. Also post flyers around tourist areas, like in cafes or starbucks. Hope that helps!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	people in hell want ice water|`|9Ss62yKWaa	Great idea.   first, you must understand anything about travel guide; planing, preparation, safety travel, guide, hotel, hot place for vacation, etc.   http://worldbidtravel.com  You can find and download a free ebook or travel kit for your benchmark, use search engine like yahoo.

We was never brought to justice because his Arab captors disarmed him and then tore him limb from limb.|`|BTSQBk6Taa	He was a wacko who killed arab worshipers in the Tomb of the (Jewish ) patriarchs in Hebron close to 20 years ago.  The reason his name is famous is that it is almost unheard of for a Jew to start shooting people at random.    Try listing the names of all the Arabs who have gone on shooting sprees against Jews in Israel since Baruch Goldstien? Can't, that's because it's so common that it stays in the news for about 24 hours.|`|b8ae5eef3b2d61ecb71b1965967306bcaa	Of course, you are not asking, "Who is Baruch Goldstein?" What you are asking is what actually happened in Adar 1994.  First: Who was Baruch Goldstein? Baruch Goldstein (Z"L, HY"D) was a saint and a scholar known to many of us as the most gentle soul we had ever met. He was a poet, a historian and a giant among men known to all as a giver and a comforting individual. He was a physician who often went more than 24 hours without removing his boots or placing his medical bag more than a meter from himsel so that the victims of Arab terror would not have to wait an extra ten seconds to receive his aid (generally delivered by him without payment received by him). He was a genius and a philosopher. It would be impossible to list all of his good traits.  What happened in Ma'arat HaMachpela in Adar of 1994? This is a subject I have researched for the past 15 years. I approached it in an impartial fashion. I have read accounts (of people who were not in Hebron that day) describing him as having a psychotic break from having lost (to terrorism) more than a dozen friends and fellow-Israelis commencing 18 months prior to the event in The Cave of The Patriarchs. I have read interviews with people who saw Dr. Goldstein less than a week prior to the event of that fateful day in 1994. I have analyzed more than twenty thousand pages of reports, books, newspapers, etc. (from every viewpoint you may imagine) and listened to more than five hundred hours of interviews, etc. The following are the conclusions that appear to be the most accurate historically:  1. There was a group of Arabs who were planning on massacring many (I have estimates as high as nearly ten thousand and estimates as low as a probable total number of Christian and Jewish victims of 250) Christians and Jews on that day.  2. The "mosque" was being used as a place to plan the attack.  3. Dr. Goldstein was approached by Israeli Army officials and told there was credible chatter that a(nother) terrorist attack was planned for that day and that he should be available because this one was going to make Munich, Kiryat Shmoneh, Ma'alot, Tokyo Airport, etc. look small by comparison.  4. He obtained information (there are differing versions as to the source) that the "mosque" was the center of the planning operations for the massacre-to-be.  5. He went to the "mosque" and prevented the attack and neutralized the terrorists. (There are three major and conflicting versions of the order of events as to how this occurred and numerous theories as to whether he expected to survive after he prevented the terror attack.)    6. He was murdered/killed in the "mosque." (There are two versions as to whether he was beaten to death or shot and two versions as to by whom.)  Question: Was every single person in the "mosque" that day a terrorist? We will probably never know the answer to that as we can not even accurately determine the exact number of Moslems in the "mosque" at that time, but it appears most or all of the individuals shot by Dr. Goltdstein were part of the plot or were used as shields by those who were.  Question: Is Dr. Goldstein a hero or something else? You decide. He appears to have prevented a 9/11 type of event. Some call Martin Luther King, Jr. bad names and some praise Hitler and Arafat. I am not telling you what to think; I am merely reporting the facts and letting you decide who you admire and who you castigate.  Question: Was he treated fairly by the majority of the press? Probably not, but so what? The Truth is what matters to me. I leave it to demagogues and the brainwashed to repeat mantras without thinking. I am interested in The Truth.|`|YSK2PbAEaa	He was a resident of Hebron who was murdered by Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs.      .
VxtSO8BGaa	"Hi"....nope.....no rental car service at the ferry terminal !     The ferry system is actually an extension of the highway so it's off the ferry and straight to Victoria about 25 minutes away passing the turnoff to Sydney !    What I would suggest is that you either catch the Pacific Coach Lines bus right on the ferry (they announce the ticket sales ) and then boot it right to downtown Victoria on the coach/bus and get a car there.    There are lots of car rental agencies in Victoria.    You can also walk off the ferry and catch transit but if you have bags it's a pain !    Glad to help ! *S* (Michael C...)    **************************************...  EDIT...Hey you're welcome "glowsnail" , my pleasure ! *S*|`|b28dc809402d907f290d1fba72651a75aa	No.  The closest place would be in the town of Sidney or the Victoria International Airport which are both a few miles south of the ferry terminal on the highway into Victoria.  City bus is available at the terminal and could take you right into Victoria where the car rentals would be a little less expensive that the airport.

uAyYRXnvaa	Work is extremely hard to get on the Sunshine Coast and wages are very low.  My partner is a qualified carpenter and was earning about $500 a week installing curtains (that is not a good wage).    I couldn't get a job at all that paid more than $10/$11 an hour, so started my own business.  It's a funny old place - very expensive to live, and most people either start their own business and can't afford to pay staff as well as in the cities.. or they bite the bullet and take a low paid job to get by.  Unless you know someone I'd say sponsorship will be next to impossible.  As someone else suggested, applying to the Sunshine Coast University would be your best bet.  Obviously shared accommodation will be more affordable.  Last time we had to look for a rental I looked at over 30 properties trying to get something liveable under $350/week.... that was 5 years ago.  I'm just being honest, it'll be very, very difficult for you.  But as they say "where there's a will there's a way"|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	As you already know, skilled immigration is out of the question at this stage as you don't have qualifications.    You could come as a student to one of our universities and will legally be able to work for up to 20 hours per week during the semester and unlimited hours during official vacations.If you do your degree in Australia, you have an excellent chance of getting a permanent visa if you choose your course with an eye to what is required here. The uni on the Sunshine Coast is small with limited course offerings and poor facilities but there are many great ones in other lovely places.  http://www.immi.gov.au/students/students...    Your best alternative for the short term however, is to come on a 12 month Work and Holiday visa. You can work anywhere at any kind of job and the only restriction is that you can't work for longer than 6 months with any given employer and of course you must leave at the end of the 12 months unless you change to a student visa.  http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...    If you're on a Work and Holiday visa and want to travel around, hostel accommodation is cheap, located in all the best places and is excellent for making friends and getting info about places to go and things to do (including what work is available).  http://www.bugaustralia.com/essentials/ (hostel info and links)    If you want to stay in one place, shared accommodation is probably best. It shares the costs of course, but you also generally avoid the hassles of taking out a lease, arranging utilities and a host of other things.    EDIT:  princesscutey has no idea where the Sunshine Coast is located. It is near Brisbane and over 1300km south of where the floods are in the far north.|`|JEMtVVkBaa	Maybe try to apply to the University of the Sunshine Coast to do a University course.

vgNELAQIaa	As a regular visitor to Vietnam, I find ex-pats come in two categories.... those who keep to themselves and look down their noses at 'tourists', and those that are great mixers.<br>  <br>  My tips for Ho Chi Minh City...<br>  <br>  The Blue Gecko, owned by Simon Ngyuen has put together a decent Australia theme bar that is oh so similar to an small pub in inner city Melbourne. Most Aussies that hang out there are Government employees and tend to mix with visitors (tourists). It is also popular with visitors and ex-pats from other countries.<br>  <br>  Another area is just off Pham Ngu Lao in the back packer district. From Pham Ngu Lao, look for Huoung Vy restaurant/cafe at 177 Pham Ngu Lao. It is opposite the lane to the Giant Dragon Hotel. The place is a very popular hang-out for expats from Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada and UK. I particular like the place because it seems all of the ex-pats there are real mixers. They don't look down their noses at visitors. Prices of food and drink is more than reasonable. It is open 24 hours. (Look for Paul the Australian english teacher with his Harry Potter glasses - top bloke and very warm and friendly. He almost lives there, since he is there so often)<br>  <br>  Down that lane way on your left is Margaritas which is a popular place for expats, but not so welcoming, but still good. <br>  <br>  Across from there on your right is Tim Tams which is a very popular Aussie and New Zealander hangout later in the evening.<br>  <br>  Further down on the right is Le Pub, which is more popular with visitors, but quite a few ex-pats are there during the day and early evening. <br>  <br>  A little further down on the right is a place which name I do not remember. It's own by a Vietnamese French man. (He left Vietnam as a refugee, and returned to invest heavily when Vietnam re-opened to foreign investment - the guy is the spiting image of Pat Morita from" Karate Kid"). That place is a majorly popular place for ex-pat French and rumored strongly to be associated with the local mafia.<br>  <br>  A visit to Huong Vy at 177 Pham Ngu Lao in HCMC will put in you in contact with expats who can point you in the right direction for up to date info on the best places to eat and drink.<br>  <br>  You can stay at the Giant Dragon Hotel across the lane for around $20 a night and is clean, tidy, 2 stars with fantastic and friendly  english speaking staff.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I am pretty sure they have good spots and a good place to drink depending on where you will visit.|`|6aI0WD8Saa	You are going to Thap Cham/Phan Rang???? If you are more than a party of one, you may comprise more than 50% of the expat population in town when you are there! You may even be 100% of the expat population while there (even as a party of one!).  See if you can find my friend "Tony", whose drinks/bites stand is set up across the street in front of one of the hotels on the main drag in town - just walk up and ask "are you Tony?" and if someone says yes, tell him "I" said hi! Not too long ago there were no expat hangouts, since there were not a lot of expats (except for the Russian MIG technicians who serviced the air force, and they didn't seem to spend a lot of time in town, at least when I was there), or at least as far I I knew when I was going there on a fairly regular basis. <br>  <br>  Enjoy, it is a nice town, nice folks, but maybe a bit quiet for many Tay tastes.|`|Cs7YotwCaa	Buy the Lonely Planet guide when you arrive. All the book sellers have them. Be sure to visit the Po Klong Garai Towers which are 5ks NW of Thap Cham/Phan Rang. Spent yesterday afternoon there with the wife's family. Worth the visit.

kjB4jLcxaa	Well it's in the northern portion of Seoul.  The address at the bottom says Jung Gu.  So it will be cheaper than southern Seoul.  I would estimate for a 33 pyeong apartment, to buy around $500,000 USD.  To rent between a $10,000-100,000 deposit depending on how much you want to pay per month.  The less you deposit the more you pay, so for a only a 10 thou deposit your are looking at over 1,500-2,000 per month.      The average price of an apartment in Seoul is around $300,000 USD.  This one looks brand new, so of course it will be double that amount.|`|q4IyhUQYaa	i live in anjung-ri and we pay 1200 usd. we are about 2 hours from seoul. it is hard for an american to get a cheap place. if you are military it is easier cause they help you on rent. but maybe 300 is right. i have been here for  a year and i have never seen anything in that range. good luck!

9z5NASypaa	Ive been to Bali three times, its an amazing place, the people are very friendly too you ( mainly coz they want you to buy something)  The main beach is called Kuta beach, its a kind of surf beach.  What you need to do is hire a scooter or a car and go exploriing round the island. There are so many hidden beautiful stunniing little beaches that noones really going to tell you about.  There is a monkey temple, where you can go see monkeys and feed them, though they do tend to get quite evil. You can go up the volcano or visit all the temples, go round all the markets and go shopping or take a boat out to the outter islands.  Mostly you will find heaps of Aussies in Bali that love to drink so the night life is great. You can try the local beer bintang or the local spirit calld Arak. Very yummy. I suggest you get a hotel in Kuta or Leigian.  Kuta is where all the resteraunts and night life is, and leigian is a little bit further down the beach.  Amazing place. Im sure you will love it if you go.  After the bombings they had there everything went down in price, so you can find some really cheap accommodation there. You have to make sure you stay in a place that has a bar in the swimming pool and is very close or across the road from the beach.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	I was there a few years ago.  Liked it very much;  had a nice 2bdrm/2bath bungalow for about $150 usd a night.  It is more expensive than Thailand, but less than Singapore.    Mostly Hindu people living there, and they were very helpful and friendly to me.  I did get to meet some locals, and had prepared in advance with some contacts online.    Frankly, though, a few days would be enough for me if I ever went back, I prefer Thailand.  Neat volcano in Bali.  Arts and crafts are more expensive there than if you bought the same imported to Bangkok.  Lots of nightlife it seemed, but I'm a non-drinker and more of a beach person.  The beach was large, but very boring I thought.    Definitely a place to see.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of must sees. Visit as many as you have time for.:    Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors cant be wrong.  1 Destination in SoCal.  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour.  2 Destination  Even if you dont visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And theyre free to visit.     Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors.     Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.    Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste.     Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies.     Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings.     Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.    Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.    Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.    TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go.     Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.    Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.    Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.    Places to eat:  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.  Pinks Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.  Tommys Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.  Canters Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.  Phillippes: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, its hot.  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.    Places to Stay:  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame.   In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.    Places to Shop:  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica  The Grove, Los Angeles  Americana @ Brand, Glendale  Beverly Center, Los Angeles  Citadel Outlets, Commerce  Brea Mall, Brea  The Block at Orange, Orange  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  Fashion Island, Newport Beach  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|C6d4ndMOaa	Stay at the national chains, if you stay any place else, you risk of getting a dump. It happened to us when we took some friends around California. I wouldn't stay on Hollywood Blvd., save some money and go someplace 15 minutes away.|`|uwzfTIKxaa	Most people would say Disney land. THEY ARE WRONG! You here me? W-R-O-N-G! Knotts Berry Farm is the place to go. The  wax muesem and Ripleys believe it or not are cool too.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	I recommend a place like the Best Western on Sepulveda Blvd if you are interested in saving some money. It's only a few miles from Hollywood and the place is not nice but it's also not a sh*thole either. I'd recommend taking one of those tour trolleys which show you all of LA. You'll need a car, their public transportation is not good enough.|`|ZCLtuEiNaa	I've lived here my entire life, and I would say definetely check out Santa Monica, 3rd street promenade. Venice Beach promenade. Disneyland or 6 flags Magic Mountain if you like roller-coasters. Also, get tickets online for free to see a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live right on hollywood/highland.

It's also right next door from Disneyland.|`|mX27tszPaa	I haven't stayed at any near disneyland only disneyworld, but I can tell you a couple pieces of advice from that.  First, you want to book a hotel that looks nicer in the pics than you actually think you need because they make the pics look really good and some of them are way outdated and if it looks just OK in the pics then it will probably be pretty crappy when you get there.    Second, if you can book a hotel that is at least on disney property then you will have access to some of the disney perks like shuttles and things like that without the added expense and usually all the hotels on disney property are pretty decent.  I also put a link to an ehow article on how to save money on disney hotels so that should help to.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4764797_discount...    Good luck and be safe.|`|K4EO2NeCaa	Im staying at Castle Inn Suites, it looks fine. I know it wont be 5 star but looks clean adn tidy and they have been very easy & helpful to deal with. Across the road from Disneyland, I think we got it for $56 a night through the gta travel website.|`|AA10214265	I've also stayed at the Tropicana Inn which is walking distance. I've heard good things about the Candy Cane Inn. I've wanted to stay at the Park Vue Inn, which is even closer than the Tropicana.     Most of the hotels offer shuttle service to and from the park.    You can price what Disney calls "Good Neighbor Hotels" on their website disneyland.com. Right now they're running a promotion: stay three nights, get the fourth night free.    Some of the travel sites like Expedia also offer rooms at the same Good Neighbor Hotels, so its worth checking out Disney's offer and then crosschecking with a travel site to see if you're getting the best deal.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	I think you're asking a bit much. Those cheap hotels around Disneyland average 100 per night. Even the Tropicana, Park Vue, and Castle Inn run over $100 in summer. It all depends whether you go midweek and/or during the busy or slow season. The Tropicana, for example, has a year-round average room rate of $160.    Basically, if you want clean, you are going to have to pay more for it. And coming during the busy season means you'll have to pay more. People who paid under $100 definitely came during slow season (like right now), and probably midweek.    I always recommend the Candy Cane Inn and Howard Johnson. They're around the same price range as the others, but just a little more value for the money. The properties are nicer.|`|uwzfTIKxaa	Disney owns some great hotels. Look them up. Many are cheap enough to stay. We stayed for a week.
