Right now I'm throwing maybe around 25 yards, being accurate is not that big a problem, as like i don't have a problem with my throwing motion and the spiral of the ball. It is just throwing harder and farther. Are there any special exercises except for the actual throwing motion?

Olha que o Robinho disse:  - As pessoas me reconhecem o tempo todo na cidade. Eles s?o muito gentis comigo. Dizem-me grandes coisas e este tipo de motiva??o  muito importante para um jogador de futebol. Eu j sou um deus e eu n?o fiz uma coisa! Mas a minha vontade  a de pag-la de volta, para mostrar a minha gratid?o com os torcedores, com timas atua??es e vitrias - afirma em entrevista ao jornal britanico "The Sun".  Ser que isso  uma forma da torcida do City cobrar uma melhor atua??o do Robinho durante os jogos?  http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/N...

20081115165507AAABoZk	Sports;Football (American)	What position should I play next year?	This was my 1st year playing football and i played wide receiver. I only caught one pass for 2yds all season, during a jv game.  All year, even in jv games and when the jv players got to play at the very end of varsity games, i was always passed up by my coaches for other receivers. I have bad vision, which led to me having bad hand-eye coordination.  Because of this, I'm really bad at catching the ball; in fact, the one time i caught it in a game, i was so shocked that i caught a pass that i forgot to run and got tackled after 2 yds.  But anyways, next year is my senior year, and I'm afraid I'll never get to play at wide receiver.  Next year there will be five juniors, probably five juniors, and me and one other senior at WR. I'm about 5'11", between 145 and 155 lbs, not very strong, not a very good blocker, and moderately fast.  Taking into consideration my "disability," what position should I play? (By the way, there are already four CBs in my grade and 2 in the year behind me).

Here are the details:   - Man Utd were leading 2 - 0 within the first 20 minutes   - Rooney scored the first goal with a header (from a corner).   - It was, Most probably, a 4-0 victory. Nani scored too I think.   - It was a 17:00 (give or take half-an hour) kick-off.      I have a feeling it was between December 2007 to Feb 08. Help please!

20061201214612AA45pZg	Sports;Football (American)	Is "The U" the most classless program in America? Will this change?	We all know there are teams like Oklahoma that love to run up the score and win games 77-0 and go for it on 4th and 10 with the game well in hand. But anything OU does is NOTHING compared to what Miami has done over the last couple of years. Do you know of any college program that starts fights with other teams? (see LSU , FIU) Do you know of any other college program of late that stomps on opponent's logos before games? Do you know of any other program that recruits criminals (Willie Williams) and has athletes recording offensive rap songs? NO. Miami is BY FAR the most classless college program in America and still hasn't gotten rid of their "punk" image. No wonder Sports Illustrated , in 1995 , once called for them to quit Div I-A football. LOL.       Anyways , notice how no one wants the Miami job? Might as well bring someone up from within (i.e. Shannon). Good luck Miami , because you're still going to blow even with a new coach.
