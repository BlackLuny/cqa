20090225023650AAd5IzB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you explain this from the bible.. Then Jesus took His disciples up the mountain?	and gathered    them around Him.  He taught them saying, "Blessed are the    poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Blessed    are the meek.  Blessed are they that mourn.  Blessed are    they who thirst after righteousness.  Blessed are they who    are persecuted.  Blessed are they who suffer.  Be glad and    rejoice for your reward is great in heaven.  Remember what    I am telling you."       Then Simon Peter said, "Do we have to write this down?"       And Andrew said, "Are we supposed to know this?"       And James said, "Will we be tested on it?"       And Bartholomew said, "Do we have to turn this in?"       And John said, "The other disciples didn't have to learn this."       And the other disciples likewise.       Then one of the Pharisees who was present asked to see Jesus'    lesson plan and inquired of Jesus His terminal objectives in    the cognitive domain.       And Jesus wept.

And i repeat the question as many willing participants could not make up their mind on the topic of the hour.Personally i feel fruits of reservation has not reached the target because of again the BRAHMIN FIRST Manuwadi mentality . In fact the reservation has been grossly misused by their clan.Today they are crying foul.   Secondly people born to legal/illegal wedlock between so called high caste parents are easily inducted into priesthood in BIG AND SMALL temples unrelated to merit/talents they talk of so loudly . In a rough Guesstimate the numbers of such people employed is in Crores directly or indirectly . This is nothing BUT RESERVATION for the upper castes which is never talked against.   Time has come Upper Castes by birth leagcy is wiped out . For that reason it is utmost necessary to take control of the govt , the military , the judiciary , the civil police and the so called high caste held all religious institutions which act as the SWISS BANKS for launching PRAGYA and PUROHITS to create MUSLIM HATE-HATE situation to divert attention and prevent consolidation of BC/OBCs.    The so called religious leaders , MAUWADI in their mental frame MANUSAMHITA as  their BIBLE / QUORAN /Gurvani are the frontman for the BRAHMIN FIRST . The Judiciary , the EC , the Military and the TOP echlon of govt officials are not free from this disease . To end casteism BRAHMINS must remove the so called sacred thread ( which is not all eaned by merits /talents as per your definitions ).

Well one thing is I was sitting here at my chair a while ago and I could have swore I saw something out of the corner of my eye, it looked like a cat or a dog. I went into the room I saw it and nothing was in there. I've seen a couple things like this off and on lately. Also I've been kind of sick so I went into the bathroom and turned the shower on to sit and inhale the steam and there was a large handprint in the steam on the mirror. Also I could swear I heard a couple things here, kind of like a sighing/hissing sound. And also we have one of those things that blocks a doorway. Like those things some people use so babies won't wander into other rooms or down the stairs. Anyway, we had it sitting up and my dog was in there with me and the thing fell on it's own. Is this all just a big coincidence and my mind messing with me, or do you think I got something?

20090225032059AAZJWDH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Have these bible passages been interpreted correctly?	John 3 where Jesus says that unless you are born of the Spirit you cannot see or enter the Kingdom of God. Especially verse 8 where he explains what it means to be born of the spirit by saying "The Spirit breathes wherever it wishes and you hear the  voice and language thereof but you cannot tell where it comes from, so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit"   Meaning: When you recieve the Holy Spirit, you speak in tongues, thats the voice and language just like it happened to everyone in the       Romans 8:15 and Galations 4:6.   Meaning: There is other way in the Bible to recieve salvation other than speaking in tongues.The Bible also explains that just as a human baby is born, you hear it cry out and you know that life is in it. So also when you recieve the Spirit of adoption The Spirit crys out Abba Father              John 4:24 True worshippers as opposed to false worshippers, must worship and pray to God in the Spirit   1Corinthians 14:2 and 14.    Meaning: When you speak in tongues you are worshipping and praying in the Spirit - therefore to be a christian you must speak in tongues       Matthew 11- Blessed are they which do not turn away from me because of my words.       Proverbs 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.   Meaning: Churches other than those that speak in tongues may tell you nice and smooth sayings but they are shooting you and your family in the foot by lying to you.          Thank you, just trying to get my head around what someone has been telling me. Thank you

Say this is happening at church, the workplace, or an environment where you are around the same people alot. I just started and one of my worse fears is becoming a relaity. Someone is already accusing me of thiings that I it would never even occur to me to do. I cannot tell if this person is joking or playing around but it is starting to bother me.    Thats why every environment should have cameras so when people start tof alsely accuse you of things they can easily be proven wrong. I also know this is a tactic of getting rid of people so I dont know what to do.      I know I cannot tolerate being accused of something that I wouldnt do. However as a black women there is a fine line between speaking up for yourself and having an "attitude" and being rude...as people mis-interpret.      Do you think it is possible that they do not like me and are trying to find someone else? IF this is the case how come they do not tell me directly?      What do I do?

20090225032040AAjEeOK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religion for Dummies?	The most logical standpoint i see is in our early beginnings.  We have this nature, this train of thought so to speak, that makes us yearn for truth, for facts.  Think about pre-man, when vocal language through grunts and yells, we began the task of finding things out, searching for truth. We saw something we cannot explain, back in those days, such as lightning, diseases, growth, health, the creation of life and so on.  Things that pre-man wanted to know, but didn't know what created all this.  So we had no knowledge back then, neither in times where history was actually recorded, so we made something up to justify them. We created  large figures that answered all of our questions back then.  We would say... act of god.  So in short, did we invent god for things that we could not explain?  For things that our societies and cultures could not comprehend?      I went to a christian school and once as a young teenager, I was doing what our species has done best, above all things we have done.  Is to further my knowledge and seek truth.  I studied evolution tirelessly, questioned every flaw about a holy figure who created all, and stupidly got expelled from that school for what was called god-bashing.  It may not seem like much to you but my parents though sadend by the fact i broke a rule, but where happy that i had found my truth, no matter how crude the way i represented it.  Then my dad said "If you have found your thruth, then why would you dissaprove other peoples truths.  If you respect their beliefs, then they will do likewise.  And to those believers that disowne you for your belief... than they are no better than you, on that day, when you drew a picture of jesus ******* a piece of **** on the headmasters car."      I know that incident may seem a bit out of charcter compared to what im typing right now.  But it happened, so yeah.  That is my truth to the belief, of belief of religion.

Like "The Cure" I like they're songs, but so many people think your goth if you do. And Fall Out Boy your emo. And so on. Isn't this classifying thing just plain dumb? I mean why do you have to be a scene, or emo, or goth or prep? Can't we just be us? I mean is that really how you fit in now?

20090225032057AABttZF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why some people think that science and spirituality are necessarily incompatible?	Freeman Dyson (a theoretical physicist and an opponent of reductionism) once said : "Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute."      Here I'd like to point out that there are no alternatives to materialism in science, yet. But that doesn't mean materialism offers a satisfactory description of reality either; the famous "explanatory gap", accepted by many philosophers as real, already shows materialism to be an incomplete picture of existence.      Anyway, why do you consider theism as an entirely illogical worldview ? No doubt humans have evolved to be inclined towards pattern-seeking, and the very fact that there are patterns or "laws" that make the physical universe intelligible for us entails the existence of a "lawgiver agent”. The universe is far from being a chaotic mass, if it were, there would've been simply no science or scientists trying to *discover* the rules laid down out there. On the face of it, it certainly seems as if the universe were thought and designed by an ingenious mathematician (Not to be confused with the intelligent design concept already refuted by science)      Now we may disagree on the nature of this law-making principle, and that is not my point anyway, but we can say, at least as it has been revealed so far, it is compatible in many ways with the teachings of the world main spiritualities. So what is so illogical about the idea of God ?      PS. Please note that I'm not here trying to turn you into a theist, but it certainly bothers me when all theists are sometimes seen as illogical closed-minded people who are unable of reasoning.      ...

20090225040954AA0BrmE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists you say that the bible contradicts itself, how?	You love talking about the scripture that says that thou shall not judge. But if you really knew scripture, you would know the bible also says in, John 7:24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. Yes you have Christians who quote thou shall not judge all the time. This doesn't show proof of contradiction, but it shows proof of dishonesty when it comes to using scripture to justify why they do the things they do or don't do. People who quote thou shall not judge are always the ones who are doing wrong and using that line to get out of someone correcting them. This is why they use the line thou shall not judge. As well as other scriptures to get people not to correct them. So no, the bible doesn't contradict itself, but it's the people who are using it for their personal gain who make it sound contradicting, but it's really not a book of contradiction. oh one more thing. A couple of months ago I wrote something asking the church, since the apostle Paul wrote one thing and Jesus wrote something else, who is in the right? The church said they both were write. It's impossible for them both to be right when both stories are different. This also makes the bible sound contradicting but it's not. It's the church that makes the bible seem contradicting. Not the bible.

20090225043233AAQ8dFl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Believers tell me that the Apostles of Christ didn't know what was going on. So which is more likely?	I've been told that the hand picked Apostles of Christ did not understand that the Crucifixion was "good news for mankind," but that since the believers now have a book to read (Bible), and the words of the one who terrorized the first Christians (Paul/Saul, who said "Christ died for our sins") that they now know something that Christ was unable communicate to his own Apostles.       Are today's "believers" that brilliant that they can grasp something that the Apostles just could not understand?      So which is more likely? The personally taught Apostles who were being trained to teach on Christ's behalf did not get it, or the people who are 2000 years removed from the actual events just don't have a clue?      And let me add here that this is how Christ spoke about the Crucifixion: "the light will be with you just a little while longer." And he said to the women who morned for him... "weep not for me, but for yourselves and for your own children." Hey, If you were around to hear that, would you be thinking that the Crucifixion was good news for mankind?      So who knows more? The people who were there, or the ones who came along to read a book 2000 years later?
20090225035631AAekGde	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christ said to become "Children of the Light."

Can you possibly explain how children of the blood can be called Children of the Light?      If you have doubts as to the relevance of this question, just pick up a concordance and look at what Christ said about "light" and what he said about "sacrifice." Dozens of positive statements on the first and about 3 negative statements on the second.      So how does the idea of Light fit in with the Pauline idea of sacrifice for sins?

Matthew 7:28-29.......28When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, 29because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.      See also   Mark 11:18.....The chief priests and the scribes heard this, and began seeking how to destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, for the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.      Luke 4:32 and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was with authority.      John 7:46 The officers answered, "Never has a man spoken the way this man speaks."      Matthew 7:28&29 seem straight forward & I am not sure what to ask about these verses .   What can we learn from Matthew 7:28&29 ?   Can you comment on the other scriptures quoted ?

20090225050150AApzi9p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of my wacky theory about Jonah?	OK, I have a theory that Jonah was in a submarine for 3 days! bear with me on this one... (try and think God exists and everything, it helps)   2 Peter 3: 8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.   imagine that this means that God is not bound by time in the same way we are   also, because time is an integral part of OUR universe (relativity and such) think - why was the universe created in this way? because God would have ultimate control on all the laws of the universe and how it behaves - so it was created in this way so that he could see the future of the universe (if he chooses to do so)   the fact we can distort time, is a side effect of this law      so essentially, this builds up to this...   because all of time has effectively happened already in God's eyes, he blagged a submarine from WW2 and put Jonah in it!   ^_^   (this has no reference to the Monty Python sketch - "excuse me boys")

20090225052554AAgoCDt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about this "Christian science"?	FIVE QUESTIONS TO ASK AN ATHEIST      1.  How did the Universe Originate?      Many atheists believe matter and energy originated from nothing.  But the First Law of Thermodynamics states "matter and Energy is neither created nor destroyed," thus atheists violate this Law of Science.      2.  How did Order Originate?      The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states a system (like the Universe) will go from Order to Disorder over time.  But atheists argue the Universe went from chaos and disorder (a big bang) to an orderly Universe.      3.  How did Life Originate?      Atheists believe living organisms first arose from non-living matter.  However the Law of Biogenesis and the Cell Theory states: "Life only comes from life."  Thus atheists violate these foundations of Biology.      4.  Was there a Cause for People?      The Law of Causality states: "Every effect must have a cause."  Atheists would argue there was a cause for a pencil, but they argue there was no cause for people.  Thus atheists violate the Law of Causality.      5.  Everyone knows Mount Rushmore was the result of intelligent design.  Do you think the human body is the result of intelligent design?      Laws of science show that it takes more faith to be an atheist than it does to believe in God.

20090225042819AAZjCtb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Thoughts on the Bible?  Bible Accuracy.  Please Respond.?	To believe every word of the Bible to be true, you have to believe that all the stories happened.  Including many instances of the suspension of the natural world.  Dead people walking out of their graves, ghosts, dragons, men living for 800 years, men parting seas, men living in fishes stomachs for several days, and especially you have to believe that a man was the son of god, born a virgin, walked on water, healed the blind, turned water into wine, died, came back again, ascended to heaven.  That people saw all this, told their family and friends and so on for 50 years and no one forgot a single word of what the man said or did or accidently changed some characteristics of the story, until finally someone wrote all this stuff down correctly, that those stories stayed pure over time (nobody changed anything after the fact), that over the several translations of the stories from Aramaic/Hebrew to Greek to whatever language to English etc… that nobody accidently translated anything wrong, also that the books in the Bible are the right ones and the omitted ones are the incorrect ones like determined at The Councils at Carthage and Trent, etc.. where people decided by vote whether certain stories should be included in The Bible and certain ones should not be.  And that again after these translations and additions and subtractions of books, that the thing you read today is wholly accurate.  Thoughts?

The recession diet works simple, and it works too!   1. Get your wages cut at work.   2. As you spend more money to make rent, you spend less money on food.   3. As you spend less money on food, you eat less.   4. As you eat less, you lose weight*!   5. ????   6. Profit!      God, dont you love how the economy is going to improve our health overall? Besides the massive amount of stress, depression, nausea, and insomnia that comes as a result of getting your wages cut and/or losing your job.      * WARNING: Studies have proven that the opposite may in fact happen, since it is also shown that people who eat less spend more in fast food. The long term effects of this diet are not known, and it can cause serious medical conditions. Please consult with your accountant before you consult this diet.   (read this part as fast as those drug commercials show the last warning.)      In all seriousness though, I have lost 20 pounds the last 4 weeks thanks to this BS economy.

I mean, what use are pearls, gold and jewels in the afterlife?  They only have value because men place value on them and use them for barter and prestige.  You have no need of either in the afterlife. What use would God have for such materialistic things?  Only men on earth build their life around trinkets and baubles. Which would lead one to believe that the Bible is not divine in any sense. Merely common, written by common men with common greed.

However, my Asian neighbour (who lives about 4 houses away from me and who I frequently see at the same bus stop now and again on the way to work and is a married man with 3 children in their 20's) is very friendly and chatty. I feel his friendliness is fine, but only occasionally, seeing as it is very early in the morning and I just want to be quiet until I 'come to'. He has begun to ask why at my age I still live with my mum, and why at 37 I'm not married. I don't mind anyone being friendly, but I feel he has crossed the line. I told him that I'm not interested in discussing personal matters a while back, but he's started up again. I now avoid him at all costs and keep my head down at the bus stop when I see him, as I can't stand the man nor his familiarity. Am I normal to feel this way and is what I doing right?  Also, he's a joker.  My mother and I were walking up the road one evening, as he was washing his car using the hose.  He then sprayed the water on us as we passed and he burst out laughing when he sprayed us deliberately.  Unfortunately, I don't share his humour, neither does my mother.

He said, that also the woman put a red dot on the head called the "bud bud ding ding" the husband would shot her on the dot if she did something seriously wrong like ask to marry a normal Christian man, or a divorce. If she done some thing minor like not get food ready or not starve herself for his long life he would make her dance on broken glass.

Rev 1:5  "Unto Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own Blood".  Rev 7:14 "These are they who washed their robes and made them white in The Blood of The Lamb."   WHERE DO YOU SEE THE TRINITY IN ANY OF THIS????

The fence between us is only 1 m high and rotten. She scowls at my kids for being too noisy, 3 and 5 year old kids cannot play quietly and should be kept indoors according to her!! So I asked her if i could replace the fence with something more sturdy to enhance safety and privacy. She said no. I then asked about adapting the current fence. Still no. I put netting up so the kids toys didnt blow through it. Still wrong. Her dog came into our garden and growled aggressivly at my 5 y old girl. She denied it. I am a council tennant so I contacted the council who aggreed to put a 2m security fence just inside my boundary foc but it would have looked awful on her side so we spent all our savings, ￡1000, on 1.8m panels, decorative with trellis on top so we didnt block the light. 15 cm inside our garden and it was done by a proffessional fencer. She is not happy. We tried to talk to her before we did it but she would not answer her door to me. She claims she now cannot dry her washing as the fence is in the way!!! I was fed up of being whipped by sheets and jeans and so on anyway but her washing should not enter our garden as far as i am concerned.      We feel bad but should we?

20090225044245AAEX2C8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Who am I? what makes you who you are?	Now this question when it pops up it confuses me a lot, I want some opinions :) just out of curiosity..    I have not had the most calm and stable life. Since I was an 8 month old child I have moved around from england to poland, to Chile, to Poland, to Madrid, to Prague, to London and back to Poland. Now I'm a 22 years old, living in a city where I spent 4 years of my youth and I find myself unsure of how to behave.. I have been a friendly person my whole life and I have loved my friends dearly, but in every country I played a different person, like if life were a big act. The distance eventually degenerates our relationships to acquaintance and now I am left with many acquaintances and totally unsure of my act.    On my road to this current situation there have been many things that have happened, I was born into a hindu sect witch I left as a 15 year old, as a 17 year old my parents left me in Spain to finish my last year of studies independently which led to several moves during the year and a growing bitterness. Finally having graduated from high school I moved to London to live on my own and fell into a 2 year hardcore drug addiction. After a nervous break down I decided to sobering up and adjusting has been a year and counting.    And last but not least my parents love each other profoundly but can almost never be with each other continuously. My dad was absent nearly my whole life searching for a better life for us which also explains our travels, always loving us but in a very confusing way. The sect was his idea lol and after that he got into don juan, david icke, power of the subconcious mind, jung and the kabbala consecutively. Now my parents are not together either. My dad is in England searching for a job as a 50 year old, unemployed for a year and a half, and my mother works in Poland where I am staying, as an English teacher earning barely enough for food.. We live with my senile grandparents in a tiny apartment..   In all this mayhem appears the question 'who am I', what a mind job..     Where your born, gives you national identity.   Your friends, a sense of continuity and value.   A home and your parents togetherness, stability.   Without all that, what really defines who you are?

If you're a gay Christian could you tell me what you think of these verses?      Lev. 18: 22     22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.         Lev. 20: 13     13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.      Rom. 1: 27     27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.         Jude 1: 7     7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
20090225060606AAToCha	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Am I psychic?  No really...?	Or is this merely coincidence....      Last night, I had a dream that I flew to Turkey with my daughter and husband. I remember specifically a point on the plane where it went down like on a hill of a tall roller coaster and everyone said, "Whoa!"      The plane didn't crash and we made it to Turkey fine.  Read this:     http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090225/ap_o...       I don't know anyone in Turkey. Didn't hear anything on the news about Turkey last night and haven't thought about Turkey period.

Why even discuss the accuracy of the Bible?      Christ himself was sowing the Word of God in the Parable of the Sower... and I can assure you, he was not sowing out bound copies of the Bible, or even papyrus scrolls to the people of his day.      And the Word of God came to John the Baptist out in the desert... and I can assure you that a Bible did not drop from the heavens on to his head!      So why all this discussion about a book when the original Word of God was obviously not a book! (more context here  http://gospelenigma.com  )

The disciples of Christ were peaceful among themselves and united before and after his going to heaven. On the other hands, before and after Muhammad's death, the Sahaba's (Muhammad's companions) were disunited--killed one another, poisoned one another, blackmailed one another, among other terrible things normally done by people lacking any genuine spiritual or divine guidance.   What does that tell you about the real origin of Islam?
20090225062040AA2EeJX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I have my own religious beliefs...?	I am a Christian. I believe in Jesus Christ and all that they say he did.  However, what I really hate is when I go to these churches and they say anyone who does not accept Jesus Christ as their lord & savior will go to hell.  I really hate that line of thinking.  That tells me that all Jews are going to hell and I don't believe that.  I just don't believe that God is going to punish anyone for a type of religion like that if they are really good people.  So, basically I want to find a church that doesn't preach so much of that BS.  I don't know much about the Catholic religion, can anyone help? Any other religion I can try out?

20090225061527AAeIJ1t	Society & Culture;Languages	Why can some people trill an "r" while others can't?	I heard once that the ability to trill an "r" is a genetic trait, but I haven't seen reference for that so I don't know if it is true.      I have always been able to trill an "r", but there are many people I know who can not do it and I don't know why. Where I come from in Spain most people can trill their "r" s, but there are small minority who can't. Is it a learned behaviour? I have found in my travels that very few people who countries where the primary language is English are able to do it. Nor are people from African nations.   When I tutor please in languages I try to teach people how to do it, but I haven't been successful so far. Can it be learned? It's hard to try to teach someone something that you never learned to do, and have always just known out to do.      Can you trill an "r"?

We haven't met up on date yet so I don't know how he looks like.      When ever we talk on the phone he always talk about sex and things that he wants to do to me. Sometimes I try to change the subject but he doesn't seem to get a hint.      He always asks me what I am wearing, if I am wearing an underwear or bra, if I have hair on my arm pints or down there and if my nipples are getting hard. He always asks me these same questions ever time we talk on the phone. Yesterday he was telling me to spread my leg to finger myself while he was masturbating. The other thing is, I have a very low sex drive and he seems like he loves sex       So my am completely turned off by it and I am not sure if I want to meet up with him.

20090225051232AA4JIO7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do you celebrate other holidays that aren't in the bible?	Please answer with respect and candor      As a catholic, I do celebrate lent.   It is not pagan as some have described it which I find to be very close minded and disrespectful.      I can understand if your faith does not celebrate lent, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with those who do.      Why do you celebrate Christmas and Easter.   Those holidays are not in the bible either.   Where in the bible does it say that at Christmas you give presents to friends, family, or whomever.   Does that make everyone who participates in this holiday pagan?      What about all the shows that churches put on about the resurrection of Christ on Easter...since when is that biblical?   Is that considered pagan too.         I don't find trunk or treat in the bible either yet many children celebrate halloween...are they all pagan?      Youth groups aren't in the bible yet they have been formed.      It isn't pagan to fast, abstain, and reflect on our savior.   Catholics do not do this openly for everyone to see, we do not wear sack cloths and look like we are fasting...we just do so quietly in the privacy of our own homes.      Like I stated earlier.   I have respect for your traditions, although many of them are not in the bible either.   Why can't the same respect be give to those who are Catholic.   I don't put down your beliefs...why do you feel the need to put down mine?

20090225051147AAwD6mU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually spanking: is masochism a godly act?	The idea of “mortification of the flesh” - literally putting the flesh to death - has been an aspect of Christianity from the beginning. Christianity's first scriptures, the letters of St Paul, are the source for its ascetic tradition. Romans viii, 13 says: “If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye live through the Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.”       So is it okay to indulge in a bit of S&M in god's name?

20090225061456AAp4Bs4	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Can someone help me please?	My life's in a bit of a mess and now so is my mind. I was diagnosed with social anxiety 2-3 years ago but I think my real problem is that I am not good enough, otherwise I wouldn't be so worried about how people perceive me in the first place. On monday night I drank far too much (it helps to make the anxiety subside) and when I got back my male friend thinks I tried to come onto him. I am not entirely sure what happened because I was drunk but I would like to think I was only being friendly.      So yesterday I had a huge hangover and my housemates wanted me to go out with them. I went with the understanding that I wasn't going to drink. When I was there I was extremely nervous. I couldn't speak properly to my friends and I tried to dance but it was more like standing on the spot and jerking my head back and forth. Now anything I said to Chris, the housemate who I've considered to be my best friend, was kind of shuned. He just looked at me and at one point I saw him look towards another one of our friends in a way to laugh at me.      So I had one drink, and I came home at 12AM feeling depressed. I feel like I don't fit in, the people I live with are probably confused about my behaviour, and I think living here is going to fall to pieces like everything else in my life. Every attempt I make fails: my old job, my ex girlfriends, old friends, trying to get my life back on track. It's like a horrible trick is being played on me and underneath it all I have so much ambition.

What do you think I should do, because I want to hang out with him, but on the same note I'm really confused?

20090225054102AAH3S8K	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will I really go to Hell for something I simply cannot believe? How is this free will?	The Bible says that God gives us free will to choose whether or not to believe and accept that Jesus is the Son of God and was sent to Earth to die for our sins. But can anyone honestly tell me that they can force themselves to believe something?       Imagine someone gives you a book that millions of people claim is infallible and divinely inspired. In this book, it states that every human being on Earth is surrounded by 12 purple unicorns every second of every day, but that these unicorns are invisible to humans. It also states that if you "choose" not to believe that this invisible purple posse exists, you'll spend eternity shoveling unicorn feces in 120 degree heat. Would you believe it?       Given the current available evidence, I simply cannot force myself to believe the claims of the Bible. So, how exactly has God given me free will to choose my eternal fate? You either believe something or you don't. You can't "choose" to believe. Sure, I can go through the motions. I can pray, go to church, tell myself over and over again that I accept Jesus Christ as my savior, but if I don't actually believe it, what's the point?

I went to a interview for a job that was just down my street (literally it was a 5 minute walk from my house), doing EXACTLY what i did at my last job, i have 7 years experience in this field and similar. Anyway, went for the interview, i thought i did really well and was silently hopeful. I gave it my all. Well as interviews go, i didn't get it. Apparently 14k jobs go to people with more experience they told me, but i was really great and it was a hard decision etc etc. Really bigging me up even though i didn't get it.... Desperate times means i have to take a pay cut in a field i know about and they took someone more experienced, (do you need a phd for a lousy office job?)      Long story short, today i got an email from another job agency about this same job. They called and said would i like to apply and i said no, i already had and was unsuccessful. Now the part that's pissing me off is that they told my other agency that i was great etc etc. Interviewed really well, knew the company, knew the job role, experienced.... then they chose someone else. Fine i can live with that. But then the job role opens again (a mere month after I applied) and they don't look back through past applicants? If i was so great why did they not re-consider me? Why the hell did they say i did really well if i obviously didn't in their eyes? Hard enough finding a job and i would of appreciated the honest feed back. Yet they lied. Why? What do they have to lose by being honest? It's pissed me off because now i don't know about my interview technique. Am i usually rubbish at interviews? Is my experience not as good as i assumed? Are my qualifications not enough? I have half a mind to call the job up and ask....

My son came out to me as gay a month ago, and I used to not be accepting of him. However, I realized that I didn't want to lose my son, and I learned to accept him. When I see that all these countries don't allow gay sex, it just makes me sad. So, I'm going to be extra supportive of my son until the end. But why in the world is gay sex illegal in so many countries? I don't see a good reason.

20090225055607AAVzvt0	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My Girlfriend Asked If I Ever Thought About Having A Threesome With Another Girl. I'm A Guy But Don't Want To?	Well I've been with my lovely girl for so many years. We just had our 5th anniversary on valentines day that just passed.       Ever since our anniversary came last valentines 2009 she's been acting weird saying things like "I want to do more in life, I'm getting older, things are kind of routine, etc". Now this isn't an everyday thing but she has mentioned it a few times.      A couple of days ago she asked me if she could see my myspace profile page comments when see saw me browsing through myspace. I've been using it for years in front of her and she never cared to see it at all. She doesn't use a computer so she doesn't know much about how things work online, and is oblivious to how raunchy the net can be. Now being that I'm a musician people leave massive amounts of comments about my music on my myspace page, as well as some girls who tend to leave me comments on my looks or what have you. So as many of you know every profile has a pictures section. I kindly asked her if she would be understanding and act like an adult before I let her see things I can't really control since I my profile is setup to let all comments automatically approve, and post. She read random people's comments about my pictures for the first time ever, and asked me why girls were all over me, saying I'm sexy, that they want to marry me, and obsessing over my looks and stuff with some really juicy comments. She got very upset for an hour and I had to reassure her that it was about time that she dealt with some of the fanfare I've been receiving now and will be in the future. We had talked about stuff like that happening since we first got together since she knew it was inevitable. Accept this time it is happening! I told her that I want no one but her and don't even talk to the girls that leave me comments. She seemed really upset and asked if I sit and cheat on her when she's not around by talking to girls on the computer. I said no, and had to reassure her that I only care about her. She let it go and brushed it off but did bring it back up the next day for another angry confrontation which ended peacefully again with reassurance towards her being my one and only.      Than a few days later out of nowhere she saw me sitting on the computer and casually asked me if I ever wanted to have a threesome with a girl.      She also came out and told me said '' back in grade 10 there was this one girl who I was chilling with and we were alone at her house kind of under the influence of alcohol/weed, and both of us kissed and ended up touching each other down in our privates until we had orgasms. Touching each others breasts, and well we even penetrated each other with our fingers." I asked her if she was watching adult movies when it happened she said "no". I was shocked that my girl has done this kind of act in the past. It made me feel dirty and upset but in a small way aroused and excited. She laughed out loud because she couldn't believe that she told me something so personal like never before.       She told me all she wants is to have sex with another girl and I. But more specifically having the girl do certain things to her. To make things even more awkward I asked her what this girl would look like, and she said "pretty much like me but fit, with a nice body, big chest, and rear".  I asked her how long she has fantasized about this and she said she has been having this fantasy for over 2 years.       People I don't know what to tell her or if I should tell her more about my issue with her thinking like this. Now I'm wondering if she's bisexual which she says she isn't. Or if shes out there doing stuff with girls since she initially said that doing something with a girl isn't cheating to her but since it is to me she takes it as I see it. I'm so heartbroken, this is the love I want to marry one day... We're perfect for each other. But now I'm wondering what else shes hiding. Maybe shes done more than that. Maybe she has had a threesome before. She said it herself last night without me asking her, that she hasn't but who am I to know? Please help me!!! What am I to think, say, or do? I am getting so insecure about my relationship. Help me... This is a girl I've known for 8 years and been with for 5. She hasn't ever come out to me this way before... I'M SHOCKED!

I'm learning english, and although I undertand what people says; it's hard to me to distinguish english accents, so I was given some listening exercises.

If I just understand what they're saying, that's not funny; but if I listen well HOW they say it, then it's funny.        http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=lrDixgft1A...     http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv75mhoNN...     http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sS...

I think Iwas able to do my homework, but although I could distinguish between the accents in the exercises, I was asked latter to answer where the guy who tells the instructions is from.    He doesn't sound like anamerican to me, could you tell me where that accent is from? Is he a native speaker (but from another country) or is he form a non-english-speaking country and he's speaking english? if so: where do you think he is from? It's hard to me to identify that ccent.

Some may argue that you cannot be addicted to the latter and that is OK, but if someone is using it on a daily basis multiple times a day, is this worse than someone using alcohol multiple times a day.       I ask because I have a family full of alcoholics and I just don't understand why when it has caused so many problems in peoples lives they would allow it to be legal, but outlaw the use of  Marijuana, which I have seen not to have as much of an effect on people.       Is it because the way that we take in the drugs?      Is it because of alcohols background in history?      What do you think?

Well the only thing is we are still at the friends stage. How do I get to know him better and get him to notice me? I don't want to rush but I am really eager to get closer to him. I am sixteen and I have never so much as held a boys hand. Since I am new at this I have no idea what to do! And I don't want to embarrass myself. Can someone please help me out here?!

20090203142348AAPIlS1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	All religions are right or all religions are wrong, true or false?	First of all, it seems like most people would instantly disprove any theory where "salvation is decided at birth" which, stangely enough, is true for most religions, because they believe that your salvation is based on your religion, and most people follow the same religion they had at birth. Therefore, statistically speaking, for MOST people, their salvation status is determined from birth.      Preposterous.      Anyway, I believe that all religions are "correct", in that they are just here to help us in our life on earth: peace of mind, good will toward men, etc. etc. They are in no way requirements for salvation, except unless they help you become a better person.      Ironically, this means that perhaps most of the "really religious" people who don't help others aren't going to make it, but oh well. Pretty much EVERY society on earth has the rule      "Treat others as you would treat yourself"      in some form, so you REALLY have no excuse.

20090225062918AAJxPrW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Cain & Abel; Question 4 ( please read to the end)?	In The ‘City of God’ St Augustine wrote of two types of men forming two types of cities: the way of Babylon (Cain) and the way of Jerusalem (Abel). The earthly cities of Cain-type were corrupt and hopeless and destined for hell, whereas as God's chosen people, those represented by the Church, which inherited the mantle from Jerusalem, Abel-type believers were pilgrims on this earth moving toward a higher and more perfect eternal life in heaven. This frequently led to the view that God's chosen people were more important than others, and hence a basis for religious bigotry. This often meant that the Abel-type people could use the earth and run roughshod over Cain-type people and their social institutions to promote their pilgrimage to heaven. This promoted a dualistic worldview in which of the spheres of Church and State in Western civilization would never be reconciled. Some scholars attribute the dualistic outlook of Augustine to his prior affiliation with Manichaeism with its cosmic dualism of good and evil.      This Interpretation by Augustine was used as a excuse to justify    Anti-Semitism and Racial Discrimination throughout the Centuries (Innocent  III Papal demand that all Jews distinguish themselves from Christians by their cloths - a Yellow Circle - The mass deportation of the Jews from England under Edward I and similar laws passed by Alfonso X of Spain)   The Slave Trade (The Christians saw the Blackness of the Africans skin as the ‘Mark of Cain)   The Holocaust (mass Genocide)   The basis of racial discrimination.   The Mercy of God shown in the Mark given to Cain has been misplaced as punishment   (Marked man etc)      This is what a literal interpretation of an esoteric narrative has done to humanity      How does this interpretation of Cain & Abel affect society in the 21st C ?      Have we learned from our mistakes?

A group of six church-goers came in last night after their evening services and sat down, not in her area but in another server’s. When the girl came to greet them and take their drink order, one of them said, “We want to tell you up front that we will not be tipping you tonight because…”          Are you ready?          “…we do not believe in people working on Sunday.”          The girl was taken full-aback, stammered out something that sounded like “I wouldn’t have to work on Sunday if so many church people didn’t come in,” or some such. She was furious. So was the manager of the restaurant whom she summoned to deal with them. I think he should have tossed the people out on their…uh…Bibles. To his credit, and demonstrating something like agape all around, he did say to them, “Well, we don’t believe in making our people work for nothing, so I will be serving you tonight.” And he did.

20090203145221AA3aLg8	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	How to find meaning in life when there isn't any?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my lif

If this is true, then wouldn't that mean that having human freewill is a curse and not a blessing? He gives humans the chance to be forced to endure eternal misery after they die just by making a few mistakes in a finite lifetime while he lets animals do all the same things and anything else they want, but God will NEVER punish them after death, humans have to follow rules while alive or be tortured with eternal misery after death whereas animals DON'T have to worry. This means no animal, no racoon, grizzly bear, sheep, wolf, snake, or killer bee or T-Rex from millions of year ago; has to worry about being tortured in a place of pain and misery called Hell, after they die. No matter how the animal lives, what it decides to do, what it wants to believe, and no matter how many other animals(or humans) it kills, or how it wants to do things, it has no worries, God takes good care of the animal and brings it straight up to Heaven without any hassle, questions, or judging.      This means God favors animals over humans.

Its been going on for awhile.. Theres this boy in my year; and i suppose he's quite popular. But i've never really liked him anyway.. i think he's mean to pretty much everyone and he thinks he's better than everyone, i hate him. He's always calling me names like '****' and stuff, and saying ''nobody likes you'' and stuff like that, he always finds SOME way of putting me down and making me feel bad and upset. (It doesnt seem THAT bad.. but it really hurts my feelings and when i get home i just sit on my bed and cry...) Today, it was snowing, and it was fun! because it hardly ever snows here. But him, of all people, threw a massive snow ball in my face and it really hurt. He's always pushing past me and kicking me and just making horrible remarks about me, i dont know what to do. can anyone help? :/

I have also been taking Japanese for a year and a half, and my friend and I are currently searching for an international school in Japan to go to next year. Instead of becoming a manga artist, I want to become a studio musician and a translator for Japanese manga (because my drawings aren't that good) and live in Japan. I also don't just like anime and jpop; I also like the culture and everything, like the clothing, the temples, etc. Many people call me a weaboo, and it is really annoying.

20090202103741AA3FxKL	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is my buddy flirting with me?	I am gay and have a very good friend I hang out with a lot.  As far as I know he's straight and has a girlfriend but I wonder about some of his behavior towards me...  He likes to sit right next to me on the couch with our legs touching while watching TV even though there's plenty of room.  He stares very intently in my eyes me when we're talking and he often asks to trade back rubs (which I usually agree to) and now he's taken to tickling me all the time since discovering where I'm ticklish and hugs me every time we part company.      I don't know if this is just platonic affection or if there's more to it...  What do you think?  What should I do if there is more to it?
20090203144806AAOdngh	Society & Culture;Etiquette	They can be mean but I can't? (A bit time-y but I really need an answer)?	Okay so yesterday, I told my friend that she was breaking out (BUT NOT IN AN INSULTING WAY) but more in an advice-way to give her a heads up on not to touch her forehead because we all know that if you get one drop of bacteria in it then it's game over. So anyways, after that, she started calling me a mean betch and stuff. I was like "I'm only saying. I'm not trying to be mean or anything" and plus, she WAS my friend before she went psycho. Why would I be "mean" to a friend? Seriously, then today, I apologized to her and she was like alright. Then, during last period, she starts to flip out and decide to make up stuff about me and keep saying I was mean and got half the class to hate me. She was "listening" to a conversation that me and another classmate had. Okay, but recapping, I find her (my friend) more mean than "I am". She makes fun of gay people at our school (from Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender club) and calls her friends betch and fags. Okay, so when did being mean to gays is okay and when was it considered "nice" to call your friends whore, skank, slut, tramp, fag, and betches? Last time I checked, those were insults. Then she gave me a lecture :       "I'm not your friend until you start being nice"      and such and such. I didn't say anything back. She's been calling me those names for so long and seriously, I never got mad at her even those are hurtful. Okay so, I just told her to be careful and not to touch her forehead because it's breaking out and all of the sudden, I turn into the school's most hated girl?       She was saying how I'm always mean to her and stuff. Um, reality check to her. She betrayed her friend Danielle. Danielle ALWAYS gave her answers to quizzes and tests and one day, she forgot to study and Danielle asked if she could get answers off of Olivia and Olivia said no. I got really mad at Olivia (my friend) but I didn't say anything. I felt sorry for Danielle so I gave her my answers instead.       Okay, seirously, what do they expect from me? If Olivia was really my friend, she would know that I'm never mean to her. I'm NEVER mean to any of my friends. Even though some of them misinterpret my jokes as insults but they're never even about them.       Also, during last period as I said earlier, me and the other classmate was joking and Olivia decides to eavesdrop on our conversation and doesn't even know what we're saying. The only thing she heard was me (she claims) making fun of this girl who moved 2 years ago. I was merely repeating what the other classmate said and all of the sudden, everyone says I'm mean? Wth.      Idk what to do. I already apologized if I insulted her and she was okay until the end of school. And she wants me to be nicer when she's no better?

HI all,      heres the thing, when I was young at at school I was a bit of a tom boy and 99% of my friends were male. and still are. I have been with my boyfriend for over a year but lately he does not approve of me meeting my male friends for dinner or simply going to the cinema with them. i never flirt with them as they are all like brothers to me and even my boyfriend says I dont flirt but he feels the guys do.... even though they dont!!

(2/2/09) The management company arranged this and I have a notice written stating my work starts 2/2/09 and there is other work due to be started 2/9/09.  Today is day #2 and nothing has been done to my balcony.  I had to clear it off of plants, furniture and I am still waiting.......  I called our management office x2 with no response.  I called the contractor.. no response.  Meanwhile I have a written and a verbal notice telling me I was due to have this work done.. yesterday.        I noted there are work men on the property who told me that they dont' have my supplies or scaffolding yet....  OK.  IF THE NEEDED TO SWAY FROM THE SCHEDULE SHOULDN'T OF I BEEN NOTIFIED???

20090203143854AA5zVO5	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do you hate people who are nice to you, even if they don't like you or think you're weird and annoying?	If you don't like someone, tell them because don't pretend to be nice just so you won't hurt their feelings. It will only hurt worse if they find out you were never their friend. It gives the person false thoughts and they'll actually think they're liked. People do that to me and it pisses me off. Today, this loser (who my English teacher lied to me and said she was nice), had a problem with me sitting one chair from her, and I did that so she wouldn't say anything about me sitting next to her. Well, that didn't stop her, she practically begged this other jerk to sit next to her, she didn't actually say it, but I knew it was because of me sitting by her. This guy, who was also a douce, was like "Madi, just let her sit there." She whispers "No! I don't want..." But, I wasn't going to sit there! I sat a gap between two chairs from her! She's nice to everyone else, but secretly doesn't like me. And rolls her eyes if I say something. A lot of people at my new school do that and it drives me nuts, like this guy I talked to today on facebook and I said how was ur day, he ignores me and signs off later. I don't have true friends, and if I were to movie, I wouldn't miss anyone there because they're all superficial, but I still want them to like me or have a few genuine friends.

20090203145257AAHhAZ2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I gay or just an undecided virgin?	I am a 20 year old male virgin in college, still a virgin, was never that outgoing and didn't really ask many girls out...I had one relationship, if that I went on a first date and we were really good friends before but we were going to colleges 3 hours apart and didn't live close.  So I've never been in a sexual relationship, and I want to be, I'm not holding out in any way! I use to masturbate to straight porn and still do, but more gay porn than regular.  I think it's because I'm concerned how big my penis is and want to "compare" myself to others.  I think i could be Bi, but I think until I loose my virginity, I will never know.        * I would love to get opinions from bi, gay, & straight, for more of a perspective!
20090203144353AA1XuL6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Oreo?(white on the inside and black on the outside)?	So I'm 11 years old and I'm black and I listen to rock music and my mom was just like me, and my dad thinks it is bad and he made me cry once because he saw me listening to rock and he said since you're my child I thought you'd like my music. My friends call me an oreo and they are all white, and other people say "all her friends are white" and it offends me. I love rock, but because they are like that I say "should I be like the other people in my classroom that are black?" Honestly, I cannot understand R&B or Rap and HipHop, and the black kids in my school won't even talk to me, and sometimes they make fun of me, but they usually leave me alone. Seriously! Why do people get made fun cuz they're oreo's?! I get it from my mom, and my sister and brother are mixed, and they listen to rock. I would call myself kind of punk cause I listen to MCR, Paramore, Taylor Swift(I listen to some country too) Korn, and Slipknot. Basically the question is, why do other blacks not like it when there's a black person that acts white?"

I know you have to "know yourself" but my two 'sides' *feel* different?	Over the years I have gradually come to show strong bisexual (some would say gay) tendencies. Some of my closest friends were bisexual/gay girls. I am a guy, 20 years old and I still do not know who i am.      I know I am either straight or bi, because I am 100% physically attracted to girls and have had crushes on many.      With guys, i have really only had a couple of infatuations. I can fantasize about men and it works too - but not as much as women. I am also a lot more picky about who I think about in these, than I am with girls.      It's usually hard for me to swap mindsets, It is like i have two sides, one has crushes on girls and wants to get married and have a partner, the other side wants to have sexual encounters with men.      Most people think I am gay because I am very "flamboyant" and talk in that homosexually identifiable way. I am not gay.      The only physical contact i have had has been with guys, because I feel less sleazy coming onto them than i do with girls.       However it is usually when i am drunk that i get far enough that it becomes sexual. The two times this has happened I was not even aroused, however my friends say that is because I was scared or too drunk.       Whenever i get intoxicated I become very gay, I become much more forward with guys. However, when I am sober i always take care of how i look around the girls.       It feels less sleazy to like guys, but i like girls more. With guys, it is almost a mental need, but with girls it is more with my heart. But both needs I want satisfied.      Please help me with some advice, especially if you are bisexual as I am very confused as to why I have such a strong gay disposition but I like girls more...

Everywhere i go, there's always someone there to remind me of how ignorant a large portion of our society is. Whether it's on the highway, and some idiot is driving 60 mph in the left lane, while ATTEMPTING to pass someone that's going 59.85 mph. Or someone in line at starbucks or whatever that thinks its perfectly fine to waste everyone else's time by ordering a 10 step coffee. Or the mother that likes to let her little hellions run around the store screaming, throwing stuff and doing whatever they want (what ever happened to slappin the hell outta your kid? I got my *** beat, and look at me now)  Or playing call of duty and half your team goes 2 and 18 (old people might not understand that last one, lol)       Basically, people that are oblivious to their own ignorance make me crazy. And I am finding it hard to deal with this without showing aggression and anger.      I'm a very "non-violent" person, so when someone makes me just want to ***** slap them and call them a dumb ****, something is wrong.       Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with people like this? I know, the answer is to ignore them. But I dont think this is the right way to go about it, after all, the word ignore looks a lot like ignorance. :P

OK, Im not trying to get everyones attention, but I do from time to time sunbathing nude. I love the sensation of freedom and relaxation. There is a nudist beach in a watering place where I go sometimes with 2 of my friends. We are all 3 maids, good friends and all about 35 (knowing each other for a long time) and every time nobody else recognizes us, because we go alone and is quite far away from home.  We are here right now and yesterday I arrived and met the girls right on the beach. Everything was perfect, lying on sun, until I herded a boys voice next to us. It was a friend of mines nephew, a 19 y o boy I know since he was a baby. He was right there, at our feet, and came to ask if he may go to an amusement park. Turned out that my friend brought him as well, and he was with some of his classmates on the normal beach. And there I was, totally naked, with my fiends, in front of this young boy I know. I was so embarrassed, even if I tried to act cool. Well, it is true that the embarrassment was stronger at first seconds, than it vanished a little bit, but even so  Now my friends are teasing me and they ask me to go tomorrow again on the beach, all 4 of us. Boys crazy aunt tries to tell me that Im acting stupid, she and Melissa sunbathed nude with him and they are cool with that and that on the other hand her nephews already sow me naked. She has a point, but what should I do? Im an experienced nudist, so I can do it, but should I?

20090203145833AAsJkhK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think of my creationist detective work?	The other day a young-earth creationist answered a question with a quote I didn't remember seeing before:      "Despite the bright promise that paleontology provides a means of 'seeing' evolution, it has presented some nasty difficulties for evolutionists the most notorious of which is the presence of 'gaps' in the fossil record. Evolution requires intermediate forms between species and paleontology does not provide them." - David Kitts, Evolutionist and Paleontologist      Well, there seemed something odd about that.  So I decided to do some detective work.   First, Kitts is listed variously on creationist web sites as:   -- evolutionist   -- paleontologist   -- PhD, Zoology    -- Curator, Stoval Museum   -- PhD, Paleontology and Evolutionary Theory      In real life, he has a PhD in Geology from the University of Oklahoma (1968).  He is a geologist, not a zoologist, paleontologist, etc.  While he was an assistant curator of geology at the Stovall (note spelling) museum, that museum had its name changed in 1980 to the Museum of Natural History at UO, then again in 2000 to the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History.      The quote referred to came from the journal Evolution, volume #28, in 1974.  There was no on-line issue, so I paid the journal's online subscrition fee (it seemed like a good journal anyway), and got the full text.  Surprise...turns out the quote from Kitts was taken from a review article he wrote, where he was reviewing somebody else's paper -- and the quote attributed to him is actually a quote of *this other paper* in his paper.  He never said what was attributed to him.      Not to mention that it's 34 years old, and gee...maybe we've learned a thing or two since then.      So basically, they got all his credentials wrong, they got his jobs wrong, they took his quote out of context and it's not even his quote...in other words, absolute and complete BS.        So what do you think -- do I get a star for my detective work? :)      Peace.

Why would their signatures mean anything? They are no more knowledgeable on evolution than your local auto mechanic. (nothing against mechanics, but you see my point).       Why would anyone use a list like this to convince themselves their religion's creation story was literally true? Do we want proof so easily we're willing to accept it without thinking about it critically? And why would anyone think that because they were willing to do that that it will convince anyone else?       Dissent From Darwinism List:    http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/...

20090203150626AAYDtJJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why were the gods so violent ? ?	The Bible points out that no one was permitted to approach Jehovah’s mountaintop except Moses and a few select leaders. Jehovah had threatened to kill anyone else who tried   Early human writers often portrayed mankind’s Custodial “Gods” as bloodthirsty creatures prone to excessive violence. Sadly, those lamentable qualities did not improve with Jehovah. During the trek from Egypt to the Promised Land, Jehovah demanded unflagging obedience from the Hebrews. Many humans rebelled and Jehovah reacted with extreme cruelty. Jehovah reportedly killed up to 14,000 Hebrews at a time for disobedience. He used a variety of killing methods, such as spreading diseases, just as other Custodial “Gods” had done earlier in Sumeria.       And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ***, with the edge of the sword.    JOSHUA 6:21       After that was accomplished:       .. . they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.    JOSHUA 6:24    What does god need with silver and gold ?      The next target was Ai, a city with a population of 12,000 inhabitants. All of the citizens of Ai were butchered and the city was burned to the ground. This savagery was perpetrated city after city:       So Joshua killed all in the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the valleys, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.    JOSHUA 10:40       Does any one eles find this a little Stange ?

I did apologise but he just kept having a go.    I nearly got slapped by a person of small stature

20090203150121AAExKLE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	C'mon u anti-religion folk, what really happens after death? ?	I have been listening to a lot of debates between people who believe in some form of religion & those who do not. Let me say early that I am one of those who believe.The funny thing is that while we who believe base our belief on books written by people who claim to have been there, done that, & are writing from experience, those who do not believe base their "facts" on logic, science, & maybes from people who have never been there, or claim to have been there. The problem is that all these people are so very emphatic in their belief. To listen to them talk it is like if they know all there is to know about life after death, & what happens. They know for certain that there is no God.  There is no "it is my opinion..." or "I believe that..." It is all statements & facts for these people. They are the authority on our existence. So, I am getting the feeling that they are privy to some inside information that we other religious people are not privy to. There is some conspiracy going on. I mean, anyone who can be so emphatic about their beliefs must be getting it from someone who have been there and come back, or they have been there themself. I am emphatic about mine because my information come from someone who had been there and came back. I know, I know, I dont want to hear about fairy stories or anything. At least it is there & lots of it have been proven to be true, & for lack of a better source it is what I go by. So guys, out with it, the game is up. Who have been there & come back to testify that my guy who gave me the info have been telling lies?  Which of y'all have been there to know for certain, certain that there is definitely no God, & all this religion thing is nonsense?  C'mon out with it. I want to be in the know too.

20090203150202AA54lm9	Society & Culture;Community Service	Help with a Purpose Project for 1,500 teens?	I run a website type thing that over 1,500 girls visit. It's a site that encourages people to do something to make a difference in the world, no matter what it is or how small/big. Every person who visits the site has a common interest in music and certain bands.  I want to start a big project where everybody can get involved and contribute but where it'll still be a group project. I'm running blank on ideas though.    I got the inspiration to do a big project after seeing a movie about kids in a town in Tennessee collecting 6 million paper clips to represent the people killed during the holocaust and to learn about what happened and why people should have tolerance and treat everybody like they want to be treated.      Anybody have any ideas on what to do?
