20081121141044AAIFfKG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the music you listen to does not mention God's name is it sin?	I don't see how that's a sin... People state that anything that doesn't directly states God or Jesus is sin because they are not glorifying him. Well I have heard uplifting music that has not mentioned God at all but it still has a righteous message.      If it's a sin to listen to music that does not actually speaks of God then is it a sin to talk to people about the NFL,NBA,etc? When you are talking about sports you are not talking about God, so wouldn't that be a sin too? Or talking about a new movie, video game, etc.      Someone please help me... I'm very confused about this...
20081121140945AAjsY1V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does anyone here care about religion? I'm an athiest and really don't get why people are religous?	Like why do people believe in something they can never prove is real or ever was real.    But they can't believe in Science and facts??      If you're religous, what are your reasons for being religous, if you really think about it...      Do you agree with everything your religon teaches you?      And how can you base your whole life on just what some dude wrote in a book a few thousand years ago?

20090309181253AA2GCe4	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I don't think its right my friend called me evil cuz i don't like kids?	I don't get it. If other people want to have kids, that's fine by me. If other people want to even work with kids in their job, that's also great for them too. But first off, i'm only 16 and i'm tired of people judging me just because i am not a kid person. And my friend called me evil today and i think that's just stupid!!!! Plus i have a lot of family problems and abuse runs in my family, so i don't wanna risk turning into a parent like my dad, who also did not want kids. So how do i get people to respect me more and just respect my lifestyle choices?

20090309180853AAI2yIl	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Should there be more curvy white actresses?	Do you think that white women need more public figures to look up to like Scarlett Johansen? im black but i was just watching one of her movies. shes so much more natural than most actresses who are white. she looks healthy and shes beautiful. kate winslet as well. i dont know too many others. also i remembered that when i went to the movies to see twilight with 2 of my friends (one of them white) and one of them (white one) said that she thought the white girl was fat because she had a "big ***". i dont know the actress or her name in the film because her role wasnt very significant. she was a blonde (not the evil one). she was no beyonce by any means but she still wasnt stick thin like a lot of famous white actresses. my friend who said that has a nice figure but she is obsessed with being thin because she is a dancer (ballet).      i just personally have known a lot of white girls growing up who were victim to a severely low self esteem. people want to pull the "all is equal" thing which im usually on board with but the fact of the matter is that white women make up the overwhelming majority of women with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.       so does anyone else think that there should be more shapely white actresses in the media? i think that if there were there wouldnt be so many young white girls obsessed with not crossing the 100 mark on the scale. true story that one as well. : \      people should be healthy. many actresses exercise but arent necessarily healthy.

20090309184311AAwBrsD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	So what kind of questions are actually acceptable in this section?	apparently       1)you cant ask any question about any race because otherwise most of the answers are "that's a stereotype" or "quit generalizing".    2)you cant ask questions that dont deal with race because they get reported for some reason by the yahoo answers community      so if we cant ask questions about any race group because we're "generalizing" and we can't ask anything that doesnt deal with race then just what exactly is acceptable? you would think by asking questions about people of different races it would help to gain some cultural understanding but I fail to see how thats gonna happen when the people answering preach and judge you instead of actually answering your question      so then what kind of questions are we allowed to ask?

I am just getting irritated with people's answers of they're con artists well here is my example to prove to you guys that not all of them are CON ARTISTS!   Lorraine Warren   She and her husband solved many cases but they're most famous one was the Amytiville horror case! Were it had to do with possesion and many other things. Lorraine and her husband said there was a bad spirit and two other ones.   Also why don't you guys just watch paronormal state! Even though you guys might not believe those mediums they always know info about the case even though they have been told nothing!

I have a friend that has always liked feminine things, music, clothes, the works. And he recently came out as bi and then gay with "heterosexual tendencies." So when a guy walks by he convulses, and acts like he can't breath. He draws a lot of attention to himself, talks about the male anatomy in front of people constantly. Asks people when a hot guy walks by if he is blushing, brazenly stares a men's behinds in public where everyone will see him do it, sends people pornography and talks about homosexual sex in every conversation in any situation, and talks about homosexual relations, but when it is described to him, he freaks out as to if he wouldn't have the guts to do it, like it grosses him out and scares him. I have other gay friends and they don;t do anything like this. Is he protesting too much?

20090309185717AAA8Yh9	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why wouldn't they respond?	I attended a meeting of researchers with the possibility of being their volunteer assistant (I'm a college student).  everything seemed to go well.  I was told to email their volunteer head and another person to continue my application, but now, as I'm attempting to complete my application, neither of them are emailing me back or responding to any questions.  I've sent about three emails now, two to one of the people and one to the other (don't want to go overboard).   I am not so concerned about the position, as I have other prospects, but I am wondering what the heck went wrong that no-one is responding to me.  I.e. I'm paranoid thinking maybe I was super weird in the meeting or something.  Can anybody think of a reason why this would be happening?  I am basically trying to get over the idea that they didn't like my personality-cause frankly-my feelings are hurt!

We should  remember that school is a department specialized in academic subjects, rather than dogmatic subjects. The beliefs of a God cannot be consider academic, since such claim of a creator cannot be a testable hypothesis and of course the teachings would be based merely on faith.      I hope some answer to help me understand this because right now it makes as much sense as trying to teach evolution theory in churches.

20090309202801AAtOpVP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	X'ians & muslims: why do you think your god gave a religion he knew would cause violence towards the innocent?	Mortals like mahavira (Jainism) and Siddharta Gautama (Buddhism) revealed religions that haven't been used to justify violence towards innocent people. The religions aren't perfect, but you see far less violence towards the innocent in their history than the history of your religions. Do you find it strange that your omnipotent deity revealed a religion that couldn't inspire its followers to live up to the peaceful standards of Jainism or Buddhism? Do you think a divine religion ought to have inspired even more tolerance than man-made religions?      (A common defence is "the religion is perfect. Its followers aren't", but if the religion is revealed in a way that inspires some of its followers to do violence then the religion's partly to blame isn't it? If Buddhism inspires its followers to do violence in its name I'll criticise Buddhism on this point as well).

And FOR THIS CAUSE God shall send them strong delusion in order that they might believe a lie...so that all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness...."

Its totally your chioce ....   and you will have noone else to blame but yourself....   God will even help you out if you reject Him by letting you be deluded so you can have no excuse when you are damned.       So go ahead and curse and rage on how you hate God and the Bible.

20060905014005AAWjjeJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For Muslims concerning Jesus's ressurection...?	I've read that you believe Jesus was not crucified and killed, but rather Jesus was swapped out with a look-alike on the cross and raised to straight to God at the moment he would have died...      [Qur'an 4.157] ...they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to them so (like Isa) and most surely those who differ therein are only in a doubt about it; they have no knowledge respecting it, but only follow a conjecture, and they killed him not for sure.      This (as we both know) contradicts Biblical scripture, and I know you are taught that the explaination is "because someone changed the original scriptures of Jesus's Apostles". What I am having trouble understanding is that in the Qur'anic story of Jesus, he appears to be saying that he will die, and THEN be raised to life...       [Qur'an 19.33] And peace on me on the day I was born, and on the day I die, and on the day I am raised to life.      How do you explain this to a non-Muslim?

And even if you dont beleive the word of the Bible i trust you will have the respect not to insult or disrespect this question, i know a lot of you wouldnt dare insult Islam for fear of the retribution and see Christianity as a soft touch, so dont.

20090309203818AAsbUdP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I make my prayer come true?	I've been let down by a series of guys but I'm still attracted to men and I still wish for someone of my own in spite of all this.  I've prayed and prayed that I'll stop wanting a boyfriend so much.  I'm sure this isn't the first prayer that has apparently gone unanswered, but I wonder if there's anything I can do to make it come true.        I've prayed and prayed that I will stop being attracted to men and stop wanting a boyfriend.  I don't ever want to let someone into my heart because it will inevitably be broken again.  I've had a series of disappoinments and I'm sick and tired of having to get over someone.      I think a lot of prayers seem to go unanswered but I have had a series of disappointments and I can see that I'm not meant to have one.  I'm not bitter about it.  I've just prayed and prayed that I can be content without a boyfriend.  There's never going to be that one person that I'll love with my whole heart that won't break my heart.  I just want to stop desiring that person.      This is making me wonder if my prayers are even heard.      I'm sure I'm not meant to have one, but I want one so badly.  I just want to be able to get rid of this longing and I can't.      It seems so little to ask... and I'm being ignored?

20090309200235AA0kfLo	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Are sports to blame for the America's struggling education system?	I am a high school student, and I think one of the reasons Americans are falling behind in education is because sports are emphasized throughout high school. Sports don't provide any benefit to their education, yet they spend hours a day doing them. Some see school as a place for doing sports. Those who don't do sports are looked down upon, when they would rather spend the time learning or studying.      Why can't the United States be like Asian and European countries that don't focus on sports and focus more upon education. (which is what school is for in the first place)

20090309204146AAa3SeJ	Society & Culture;Languages	Is there a stronger translation of "love" in another language?	In English, the word "love" has a very vague meaning. Someone can say, "I love that movie!" and "I love you." In these sentences, the word has two vastly different connotations.   I've heard that in Greek, there's a way of saying "I love you" that is much stronger than others; it puts a person's love on a holy level.   On a similar note, in Turkish, there is a single word ("yakamoz") which means, "the reflection of the moon on water."    My question is, are there other languages like these which can describe a deep, intense, almost spiritual, love in a single word?

If they are not pressurised they can become the worst rulers oppressing people who are not muslim like they did in India when they in delhi raping womens looting gold from temples killing non muslims in the name Of Allah..I agree that with Israel is a long time rivalalry with muslims but Hindus in India didnt have anything to do with violence then why would they hate muslims ..ah now the answer is cause the muslims were killing every non muslims in India and marrying their womens and raping kids..that why the history speaks itself no wonder now since they are being fcuked by Isrealites they ask for mercy.

20060902064006AAxB4Jh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question on Islam?	according to Islam, Prophet Muhammad (forgive me if i spelt it wrong.. my spelling is bad) was once walking to some place from some other. Then night came. So he slept under a tree. After a while, some angel woke him up and brought him to heaven and said Allah wanted to meet him. so he went up and met Allah. there, Allah told him the people have to pray to him 1000 times (i think its 1000) he went down and told the angel. the angel said the people would b 2 lazy to do that so he asked him to ask Allah to reduce it. so he went back as asked. Allah reduced by 5. this process happened until there was only 5 left.then he felt too ashamed to ask for lesser. so the angel brought him back to the place he was found. the next day he woke up and spread the news. from an atheist's point of view, this could have all been a dream. and why did Muhammad not feel ashamed when he asked for lesser so many times. only when it reached 5 he was ashamed. why?

No l dont think of myself as judgemental.but lets use a comparrison to this human relationship. When you sit in front of a psychiatrist with your problems; to find the root problem, he will take you right back to the beginning , with the seed first germinating. One woman said that it goes back to Abraham and Sari's not keeping faith through obediance to Gods word. This is it, indeed!, thats how it all began-ABRAHAM ,SARI, DISOBEDIANCE, HAGGAR, ISHMAEL.and 16 years later lSAAC, and the following terrible family upheavel of Ishmaels family break down, being replaced by his half brother in the house that he'd been brought up in, with the Father hed loved and worshipped ,as sons do there good Fathers. So many of us will know the terrible damage that family breakdown dose to the childrens foundations, The proof is all around us in this generation. It takes Blessing out of a childs heart and replaces it with a curse of anguish and aggression and hardness of heart.- See the similarities ?

20070526234237AAsASss	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do we persist in feeding trolls?	Everyone complains about the people who only post in order to be nasty (the Ex-Low IQ question below is a case in point).  Yet everybody jumps on and posts answers to the question, so they get lots of attention and lots of fun reading everybody's outraged answers.  Yes, I know, I answer these wretched things too and I'm trying to stop...      What if we all just ignored the trolls?  If they don't get any attention for their nasty habit, is it possible they might just stop doing it?  For sure, pouncing on them and answering is just rewarding the unwanted behavior.        Rewarding unwanted behavior is the best way to guarantee that it will continue... at least that's what we learn in canine obedience training.  Ignoring and not rewarding a behavior should lead to its extinction.

So, if you are one of those people who's terrified of cloning humans or other animals, please explain your fears and thoughts on the matter.

20070311171302AAQnEVm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Que es verdaderamente ser ignorante?	EL IGNORANTE       Un hombre de avanzada edad llamo a la puerta de un monasterio.   Aunque era analfabeto y muy ignorante, vibraba en el, el deseo de purificarse y encontrar la libertad interior. Solicito humildemente que le aceptasen como novicio, pero los monjes y el abad del monasterio se dieron cuenta de que era analfabeto y de muy corto entendimiento intelectual.   Le consideraron totalmente incapacitado para leer los sermones de Buda, recitar mantrams o poder efectuar las ceremonias sagradas. Pero contemplaban en el anciano mucha motivacion espiritual y un ardiente deseo por perfeccionarse.         ?Que hacer, pues? No podia llevar a cabo ningun tipo de estudios, no entenderia la escencia de los metodos meditacionales y ni siquiera comprenderia el sentido de los rituales.   ?Que hacer entonces? El abad y los monjes hablaron sobre el tema unos minutos y decidieron permitirle al hombre que se quedara en el monasterio. Pero, aunque fuere porque no se sintiera humillado, alguna ocupacion habia que asignarle. Le dieron una escoba y le dijeron que se encargara de mantener limpio el jardin del monasterio.      Iban transcurriendo los meses y los a?os. El anciano se aplicaba con minuciosidad y esmero a su sencilla tarea. En los frios amaneceres del pais de las nieves, imperturbado y muy atento, el hombre barria con precision el jardin. Ni un solo dia falto a su deber. Y poco a poco los novicios, monjes y lamas comenzaron a darse cuenta de que el anciano habia conseguido un notable y evidente avance espiritual, un gran progreso animico. Siempre era afectivo, nunca se inmutaba y era ecuanime en las palabras. Los monjes y lamas, extra?ados, decidieron preguntar al barrendero que practicas o metodos especiales habia desarrollado para conseguir un estado de mente tan lucido, estable y ecuanime. El anciano dijo:   "No, amigos, no he hecho nada especial, podeis creerme. Diariamente, con mucha atencion, me he dedicado a limpiar el jardin. He puesto, eso si, mucho esmero y amor cada vez que barria la basura y limpiaba el jardin, pensaba que estaba barriendo la basura de mi corazon y limpiando mi espiritu. La verdad es que asi, dia a dia, me he ido sintiendo mas sosegado, contento y lucido.        CUANDO LA MOTIVACION Y EL ANHELO ESPIRITUAL SON GENUINOS   Y VAN ACOMPA?ADOS POR LA ACCION DIESTRA,    SE DESENCADENA LA SABIDURIA LIBERADORA.

20070413060142AAkrKRn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Strange behaviour?	last year I was doing an exchange year in canada (ontario) and I was living inthe campus, in a students residence. While I was in canada I made a lot of friends but I met most of them outside the campus as I noticed that ALL  the white residents didnt care about foreign students like me, especially when they are'nt white (I'm french but I have arabic origins and they are really obvious!!). They didnt not even care about the other non-white international students (chinese, indian, pakistani, etc). Evene in the food court, they were really impolite toward me!!!I would have understand if i had a bad behavior but I swear I didnt have a bad one + I'm funny and sociable. I'm not saying that they are racist  but I wonder why they were like that, I have some white canadian friends but really few. What's wrong ? they dont like French ? or Arabs or both?? I 've already suffered from a strong racism in France so the situations seems completly confused for me. What was wrong with these canadians ?

Bonjour,   J'ai dans mon devoir de Fran?ais une question que je n'arrive pas à ressoudre; Voilà la question :   -Rélève dans le poème "ma bohème" les verbes de la troisième strophe. à quelle catégorie appartiennent-t'ils ? Qu'est-ce qu'ils veulent dire par catégorie de verbes ?        Voici le poème :      Je m'en allais, les poings dans mes poches crevées;   Mon paletot soudain devenait idéal;   J'allais sous le ciel, Muse, et j'étais ton féal;   Oh! là là! que d'amours splendides j'ai rêvées!      Mon unique culotte avait un large trou.   Petit-Poucet rêveur, j'égrenais dans ma course   Des rimes. Mon auberge était à la Grande-Ourse.   Mes étoiles au ciel avaient un doux frou-frou      Et je les écoutais, assis au bord des routes,   Ces bons soirs de septembre où je sentais des gouttes   De rosée à mon front, comme un vin de vigueur;      Où, rimant au milieu des ombres fantastiques,   Comme des lyres, je tirais les élastiques   De mes souliers blessés, un pied près de mon coeur!         Merci éNORMéMENT

20070513183813AAavAeN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you define "Christian mysticism"?	I am interested in hearing from persons — whether Christian or not — who have an opinion on how to define "Christian mysticism." What separates Christian mysticism from other aspects of Christian spirituality? What distinguishes Christian mysticism from non-Christian forms of mysticism? Is there a difference between Christian mysticism and "new age" Christianity (like "A Course in Miracles" or the writings of Paul Ferrini)? And finally, how can mysticism be a significant part of Christianity in our time, and in the future? Please feel free to weigh in with your opinion, but I'm especially interested in scriptural support for whatever you may believe about this topic. Thank you!

Carta de un hijo a todos los papás del mundo      No me des todo lo que pido. A veces solo pido para ver hasta cuando puedo tomar. Te respeto menos cuando lo haces y me ense?ás a gritar a mi también y yo no quiero hacerlo.      No me des siempre órdenes. Si en vez de órdenes, a veces me pidieras  las cosas, yo la haría más rápido y con más gusto.      Cumplí las promesas, buenas o malas. Si me prometes un premio, dámelo, pero tambíen si es castigo.      No me compares con nadie , especialmente con mi hermano o con mi hermana. Si me preferís antes que los demás, alguien va sufrir y si preferís a los demás seré yo quien sufra.      No cambies de opinión tan a menudo sobre lo que debo hacer, decidite y mantené la decisión.      Dejá que intente valerme por mí mismo. Si vos hacés todo por mí, yo nunca podré aprender.      No digas mentiras, ni me pidas que las diga por vos, aunque sea para sacarte del apuro. Me haces sentir mal y perder fe en lo que decís.

JOE L WROTE: "It is a well known fact that Islam grants women greater rights and respect than any other religion or culture in the world. Islam is a wonderful, peaceful religion and they bring joy to everyone, can you not realize that any malevolence is all your fault and George Bush's fault? "   ****************************   So, I guess this is the wonderful treatment your Quran teaches you concerning your women:      4:34 If you fear high-handedness from your wives, remind them [of the teaching of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them.      And a peaceful religion teaches this too:      Qur'an 47:33 "Believers, obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. Do not falter; become faint-hearted, or weak-kneed, crying for peace."    Qur'an:9:5 "Fight and kill the disbelievers wherever you find them, take them captive, harass them, lie in wait and ambush them using every stratagem of war."

Recently, I had the pleasure of getting to know a really nice girl who recently immigrated to this country from Serbia.      When it became clear that she was becoming interested in me, I attempted to cover up some of my Redneck tendencies in an attempt to appear more sophisticated and hopefully impress her.  This included removing the gun rack from my truck (even though it only contained my fishing gear), not playing the usual country music selection on my trucks radio when she asked me to give her a ride to school, taking the buck heads off my walls (in case she ever came inside), suppressing the urge to hit my “General Lee” truck horn, and attempting to avoid wearing anything from Bass-Pro Shops, Cabelas, camouflage, and anything that featured the Confederate flag when she might be around (such items constituted the majority of my off-work wardrobe).

20070721091009AARXj7j	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is there a middle ground?	Until about 6 or 7 years ago, I always wore pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office. Needless to say, with me dressing that way for work each day, my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity for my pantyhose. Right around the time that my wardrobe transitioning to skirt suits and going bare legged with skirts, I was wearing pantyhose for work only on occasion. One one of those occasions that I was wearing them, I just asked him if he was so curious about the hose, why doesnt he just try them. I then hiked up my skirt, eased out of my sheers, handed them to him, and told him to slip them on. Well long story short, he went absolutely ga ga over the way they felt, which I thought was kind of neat. Hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again, but I dont want things to get out of hand. At the same time, I don't want to deny it to him because of how much he liked it that one time. How can I achieve a balance here?

We are so smug and secure, especially in the USA, but if at least one rising religion has its way, Christians will be put to the sword if they don't convert in the next 100 years!   Adherence to "Shiara" law has already been seriously proposed in Britian, including stoning of young women who lose their virginity before marriage.   I think it is a very real possibility that in our children's lifetime they will have to choose between abandoning belief in Christ and being slaughtered along with their wives and children.   It happens in the Middle East everyday, where people who change faiths are sentenced to die!     That's ditto for you if you're gay, atheist, Wiccans (they're the ones who started 50-60 years ago) or even agnostic!   Anybody agree?  Could you see it actually happening?  I can!

Well, they were gay, but what is the connection between sports and one's sexuality? No one is banned from sports due to their sexual orientation. It's not like the Negro League, which needed to exist due to racial prejudice. WTF?

Ok I don't find people opinions as long as there fair but racism is completely unfair and not right. I'm white but my 2 younger brothers are half pakistani.

Why do people do that because of were someones from and the colour of there skin that is disgusting and completely wrong I'm 15 years old and even I know that so what is wrong with adults?!?
