If mass can be converted into energy, and this happens in things such as explosions, chemical reactions and nuclear reactions, and the energy potential of a mass can be calculated, then how much energy is contained within my body, given that I weigh 85kg.  In essence, if my atoms could be split, like in a nuclear explosion, then how much energy would I give off?

20090129004917AAeNoGi	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Hawking Predicts Discovery of Alien Life: But Asks, Will It be Carbon Based?	Do you think this will ever come true or not?   the question, “Are we alone?”      Hawking presented three options. One, being that there is no life out there, and two – somewhat pessimistically, but subsequently, a little too realistic – being that when intelligent life gets smart enough to send signals in to space, it is also busying itself with making nuclear bombs.      Hawking, known not only for his sharp mind, but his sharp sense of humor, prefers option number three. "Primitive life is very common and intelligent life is fairly rare," he quickly added: "Some would say it has yet to occur on earth."       Alternative biochemists speculate that there are several atoms and solvents that could potentially spawn life. Because carbon has worked for the conditions on Earth, we speculate that the same must be true throughout the universe. In reality, there are many elements that could potentially do the trick.

20071224145734AA5VHli	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	? Es cierto que el Teorema de Pitágoras no es de Pitágoras?	El teorema de Pitágoras dice que en un triángulo rectángulo el cuadrado del lado más largo -la hipotenusa- es igual a la suma de los cuadrados de los catetos. Esta fórmula, tan sencilla a primera vista, ha influido decisivamente en el campo de las ciencias que se ocupan de problemas geométricos tales como la astronomía, arquitectura y navegación.   Se ha insinuado con bastante frecuencia que este teorema no es deducción del gran matemático y fundador de la escuela del mismo nombre. La opinión más generalizada es que un miembro de su escuela formuló por primera vez el teorema en una época muy posterior. Pero por el mismo tiempo que vivió Pitágoras, es decir en el siglo VI a. de C., un matemático chino de nombre desconocido debió de haber llegado a la misma conclusión. En el Chon Pel Suan O Ching, libro matemático-filosófico, se encuentra una descripción que presenta dibujado, sin ningún género de dudas, un triángulo pitagórico con sus correspondientes relaciones.

20090129005143AA2xcd1	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What are radio waves made of?	Ok so, radio waves are a part (the low end of the wavelength) of the electromagnetic spectrum (together with microwave,infrared,regular light, ultraviolet and gamma rays), and they are disturbance in the electric and magnetic fields. They go like this : /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\, like you see on an osciloscope, only the length of the wave is realy big, up to the size of buildings.   But...since light is made up of a PARTICLE- aka photon, but is also a wave (meaning the photon goes like /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\, but on a smaller scale), then what the hell are radio waves made of - or for that matter what are gamma rays made of, and all of the other "invisible to the eye " stuff> could it be that they are made of "Radiotrons?/Gammatrons/Violettrons" (per say, a particle, just like the photon, only with a lower/higher end wavelength), or still the same photon that we perceive from light, only with a different wavelength?

Pois sempre que estou debaixo das cobertas, eu fico quente.      Resposta:      O cobertor N?O esquenta.      O calor que sentimos é o nosso próprio calor corpóreo.      Tudo o que o cobertor faz é impedir que esse calor se espalhe e se perca no ar.       Como o ar ao nosso redor está mais frio do que o nosso corpo, ele rouba calor e, ent?o, precisamos produzir mais calor.      MAS...O cobertor faz com que o calor fique preso...      O ar embaixo das cobertas se aquece e pára de roubar o nosso calor...      E assim nos sentimos aquecidos...      Aquecidos pelo nosso próprio calor!!!      Essa você pode apostar com os seus amigos:      Se você embrulhar um bloco de gelo num cobertor, ele derrete??      N?o!      O gelo está mais frio do que o ar e tentar roubar o seu calor...
