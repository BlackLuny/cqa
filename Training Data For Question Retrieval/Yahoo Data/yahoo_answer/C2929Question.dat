20080317205312AAHWkzH	Environment;Other - Environment	Hola Sabían que??????	que un tercio de carbono de una persona promedio se debe a su consumo de alimentos de origen animal. El carbono que despide un auto o la energia usada en  en casa es menor  que el de una persona; sin contar que estamos cooperando a la destruccion,contaminacion y  escases de agua del planeta; Se dice que una persona desperdicia 22 libras de carne al ano no tomando en cuenta que toma 5 libras de grano y 2500 galones de agua para tener una libra de carne en la mesa,   el desperdicio equivaldria a 100 libras de grano y 55000 galones de agua si cada persona comprara  1 libra de carne menos al ano ahorraria 250 mil millones de galones de agua

20090222151843AA3jtsY	Environment;Global Warming	Did Arctic Ice Levels Exceed Normal Levels This Year?	Arctic ice levels grew at the fastest amount in record in October then the ice level appeared to just stop growing even though temperatures were at record lows.      Recent discoveries found that sensor failures caused ice levels to show 500,000 sq km less than actual amounts.       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...       Corrected values would put Arctic levels above accepted normal levels.        How can growing ice levels exist during a time of "Global Warming"?      Does the corrected level of ice cause a rethink on the theory of "Global Warming"?      Does this increased ice mass indicate that the arctic ice will not melt as much this summer?

In the $800 Trillion "stimulus" package, Obama allocated $3.4 Billion towards the research of clean coal technology.        It's going to take years before we see new clean coal burning power plants, and this $3.4 Billion is just a down payment, as billions more will be needed before the technology is perfected.      Do you agree with the president that clean coal is the direction of the future, and how much money would you use to perfect clean coal technology?       http://www.usnews.com/articles/business/...

Was Ike warning future generations of the liklihood that money would corrupt real science?      If he could only see what is being done to this great country by those two and others like them!      From:  Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation   January 17, 1961      “The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present – and is gravely to be regarded.       Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.”        http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/ike.htm

Someone in my neighborhood (I live in the mountains) is burning something in their stove that's putting off a nasty smell, not just woodsmoke.    I don't know if they're burning their garbage, or treated wood or what.   Smells almost like burning deisel fuel mixed with burning plastic and a hint of woodsmoke.   It's really caustic.   Anyone have any Idea what it could be?   Should I report and if so, how?   I don't think this is something good for the environment or to be breathing in.   Oh, and get this... they only burn it at night when no one can see where it's coming from, so I'm thinking maybe they KNOW that they're doing something they shouldn't.   Any information or even speculation is very welcome!   Thank you.
