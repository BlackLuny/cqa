You should shoot to the top of the list. Best of luck. BTW, check with your council if they can increase your grant and be sure to check if the Gignerbread group at your school can help out. If your school has no creche, demand it start one.|`|AA11000207	you can always try your luck in the council offices of all the london boroughs i don't know what kind of student you are but if your at uni you might want to try the relevant department at your uni first and see what they suggest being pregnant wont get you a house any quicker there will be another people on the housing list more in need of homing that you do<br>  if you have parents see if you can go live back home with them|`|j7fzuDxgaa	hi there yes going and get the forms from your local council you will also need your pregnancy record book and when baby is born you will need to let the council know. you will then be added to the council list.but there is a shortage of housing every where even more so in london i should think your talking years. depending on your situation ie where your staying etc|`|ypnWDDB8aa	Another one who -WE- have to pay for... perhaps you should have got a job before you got knocked up?

AULn9uPYaa	Depends where in the State you are. Backpackers will work often for cash and under award. If you look like you are a bit of a Beach person, you may not get a look in because surfers etc are known to drop tools and 'get sick' on good surf days. I know a lot of people that cannot get staff that can answer a phone and present well for love or money.

dAjYPMg2aa	No not really, the area around by the shop has suffered a little bit from graffiti, but that's kids with little else to do (unfortunately that's the story everywhere), (not running them down mind), some of the roads are named after deceased singers, Presley Way, Cochrane Ave
UDEMDcGuaa	The history of the HBC with all of its warts ( ie the exploitation of the aboriginal peoples etc) is very important to Canada however since HBS was bought by an American a couple of years and then sold to another american comapny after his death I would say that now it is just another store.|`|p5wkOii3aa	I'd say the HBC blankets are more iconic.<br>  <a href="http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/blanket/history/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/b...</a>

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	Your best bet would be to use the Postcode finder to get the correct post code.   There are are 2 Station Roads in the Diss area. One IP22 4HN appears to be an industrial area with 4 addresses and the other IP21 4QT is housing.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	FYI IP is an IPswich postcode.|`|60cwSqE9aa	The 1 is wrong. UK post codes follow the general formula:    Letter [Letter] Number [Number or (London) Letter] Space Number Letter Letter. In square brackets [ ], not always present.    Checking with Multimap.com, it appears that the correct post code is IP22 3HN.    Further correction: playing around with Multimap, the correct post code is actually IP22 4HN.|`|LvMtHQh6aa	postcode should be IP22 4HN    4 addresses listed for Station Road|`|3MvXsBVnaa	post code should be ip22 3hn
