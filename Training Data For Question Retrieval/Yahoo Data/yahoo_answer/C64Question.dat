20080925072102AAO8liN	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is the United States turning fascist?	Anyone who has studied the history of fascism and the history of fascist regimes throughout history can easily, without a shadow of a doubt conclude that the United States is directly in line with every single scam a fascist government pulls on its people.        This bailout for instance is a fascist power grab. 911 was a false flag operation. etc.  The people who would never even consider the US to be a fascist regime under George W. Bush gravely mistaken. I can understand how American citizens would dare never think the US is a fascist state because we have grown up our whole lives being told America is the best and most fair and most just country in the world.      Well I am telling you now that it is not that at all.  Now that you know, only a fool would argue that we are still a democracy and a capitalist country. This move right now for bailout is a national socialist( Fascist) move to secure elitist wealth by redistributing the wealth from the average citizen into government and private elite hands.       So my question is...what do we do to stop this fascist coup? Any suggestions? Or do we still continue to sit back and demonize the people that have it all figured out while waving the stars and stripes like mindless zombies?

20081003012951AAn1Osn	Politics & Government;Elections	Where is Obama going to get all this money?	A little Quote from his website      Obama and Biden will restore fairness to the tax code and provide 150 million workers the tax relief they need. Obama and Biden will create a new "Making Work Pay" tax credit of up to $500 per person, or $1,000 per working family. The "Making Work Pay" tax credit will completely eliminate income taxes for 10 million Americans.       Ok soooo what about the other 140 million? No tax cut?    Who is this gonna help the poor man who can't hold a job and has to pay child support at 17?       He claims to have all of these plans but only wants to tax the people who are "well off" and worked hard to get where they're at. Every other bum that sits around all day waiting for the welfare check will get rewarded because Hussein Obama wants to help your sorry ***! Right? RIGHT!!!

20090227051402AAnevrn	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do liberals betray their lack of logical consistency when they suggest that since, under BUSH II, the national?	...debt increased by $4 trillion that, under Obama, no amount of increase in the national debt matters?      I ask because there are about 30 posts a day here by different liberals who seem to imply just that. They appear to have no earthly idea of just how much Obama is planning to spend with the help of Pelosi & Reid. Nor do they comprehend that it is THEY & THEIR CHILDREN who will be paying significantly higher taxes for the rest of their lives as a result.      Can they really not do simple arithmetic? I mean, really, the numbers are in enough different sources that it's not difficult to piece together the fact that Obama is planning a MASSIVE EXPANSION of government and he plans to borrow most of the money with which to do it. That whole "We're going to raise taxes on people making over $250,000/year, increase the capital gains tax, and make the government more efficient." schtick is just that - a schtick.      Here's what I suggest for you liberals: Starting with 2009, and for each subsequent year, write down the current amount of the national debt and also write down the amount of the deficit for the preceding year. THAT is the sort of exercise that will allow you to determine whether or not your elected betters are selling you a bill of goods.      I GUARANTEE YOU that you will be surprised by what you discover. It will put paid the nonsense that, just as he's announcing a New Deal-style spendathon, Obama is going to reduce the deficit by half. WHICH DEFICIT, PRAY TELL!?!      Let me suggest that what he's really saying is this: "I'm going on a spending spree of epic proportions but I PROMISE that I'll make it all good in the end." To ANYONE who buys that sort of nonsense, all I have to say to you is: I have a bridge I can sell you cheap. Real cheap!

20090227052215AA0BK6E	Politics & Government;Elections	Do you think young Americans need to hear this ?	A Letter From a Grandpa      Guess you heard that 68% of the youth vote went to Obama.. My granddaughter called this morning to tell me she was one of them. I replied with this e-mail:      Dear Granddaughter,   The election of Obama comes down to this. Your grandmother and I, your mother, and other productive, wage-earning tax payers will have their taxes increased and that means less income left over. Less income   means we will have to cut back on basic purchases, gifts and handouts.      That includes firing the lady who cleans our house twice a month. She just lost her job. We can't afford her anymore.      What is the economic effect of Obama's election on you personally? Over the years, your grandmother and I have given you thousands of dollars in food, housing, cash, clothing, gifts, etc. By your vote, you   have chosen another family over ours for help. So in the future, if you need assistance with your rent, money for gas, tires for your car, someone to bring you lunch, etc. ... call   202-456-1111 . That's the telephone number for the Office of the President of the United States. I'm sure Mr. Obama will be happy to send a check from his personal or business accounts, as we have, or leave cash in an envelope taped to his front door for you, as we have.      It's like this.. Those who vote for the President of the United States should consider what the impact of an election will be on the nation as a whole and not just be concerned with what they can get for themselves   (welfare, stimulus checks, etc.). What Obama voters don't seem to realize is that the government's money comes from taxes collected from tax paying families. Raising taxes on productive people means they will have less money to spend on their families.      Congratulations on your choice. For future reference, you might attempt to add up all you've received from us, your mom, Mike's parents and others and compare it to what you expect to get over the next four years   from Mr. Obama.      To congratulate Mr. Obama and to make sure you're on the list for handouts, write to:                The White House            1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW            Washington, DC 20500      Love you Honey, but call the number listed above when you need help.

I know about the 1.2 trillion and the mortgage bail out for 600 billion. Now I'm hearing about another 4 trillion for something else? Plus there's also the spending plan with the 8600 earmarks. I also heard on a separate news agency about another bail out in the trillions. Does anyone have the totals? They are throwing so many numbers out there that it just seems made up. It's overwhelming.
20090227052434AA19qzf	Politics & Government;Politics	Wouldn't this be a brilliant plan to take over America?	The Feds could allow big banks to exploit people by effectively becoming loan sharks so that many people can no longer afford their homes.  These people default on their loans and the banks foreclose on their property.  Then the economy continues to decline and the government has to gradually gain control over everything to "save us from disaster".      Wait...this sounds familiar....

OK, I don't just mean that the government should go around ruthlessly and pointlessly torturing any terrorist they come across. I mean controlled torture to gain information that could SAVE innocent lives. Im talking about where we are almost certain that the person was a terrorist, were we are almost certain that the person held information that could save innocent lives and were we are almost certain that by torturing we would get that information. In this situation, would you be for or against torture?

Io, prima pensavo :"E' giusto, in un'Italia così difficile, rendere più... più snelli, più facili i rapporti di reciproca assistenza. Un Di.Co. è una via attraverso la quale si mettono più facilmente in condivisione le poche "forze" (economiche, fisiche, di tempo libero...) ancora in possesso degli italiani. Due persone che mettono in condivisione le proprie forze non tolgono nulla agli altri.      C'è però il punto riguardante la reversibilità della pensione. Vi pongo il caso estremo : un/una giovincello/a stipula un Di.Co. con un/una anziano/a in fin di vita. Magari il primo (o la prima) non ha mai lavorato in vita sua, ma in caso di decesso del secondo (o della seconda) prenderà per un bel po' di anni la pensione.

20070122043005AAXPdMO	Politics & Government;Elections	Que pensez vous de cette info ????	Exclusif Capital.fr Patrimoine de Sarkozy : le candidat a vendu un appartement 1,9 million d'euros       Le patrimoine de Nicolas Sarkozy et de sa femme Cécilia est probablement au moins deux fois supérieur à celui de Ségolène Royal et de Fran?ois Hollande. Selon la conservation des hypothèques de Nanterre, le couple Sarkozy a en effet per?u, le 10 novembre 2006, 1.933.130 euros de la vente de l'appartement qu'ils occupaient boulevard Vital Bouhot, sur l'?le de la Jatte, à Neuilly sur Seine.       A moins qu'elle ne soit largement gagée par des emprunts, la possession d'un tel logement aurait probablement d? rendre à elle seule les époux Sarkozy redevables de l'imp?t sur la fortune depuis de nombreuses années. Or le candidat de l'UMP a fait savoir par la voix de son porte-parole, mercredi 17 janvier, qu'il ne payait l'ISF que depuis un an.       Jusqu'aux années 90, Nicolas Sarkozy était propriétaire, avec ses frères, de plusieurs appartements à Neuilly, notamment avenue du Général de Gaulle et rue Bailly, mais il a vendu ses parts en 1997, vraisemblablement pour acheter celui de l'?le de la Jatte.       Contacté par Capital.fr, l'entourage de Nicolas Sarkozy n'a pas souhaité commenter cette information.

La France c' est pas seulement le RMI ou l' allocation ch?mage ou bien un meilleur niveau de vie avec un beau métier à la clé, c' est la langue de molière, des institutions un code civil.   Alors je me demande pourquoi ne pas faire comme aux USA un examen concernant nos traditions nos valeurs et notre langue, plut?t que de donner sur le simple fait qu' on a vécu en France ??

20071114114552AAga7BV	Politics & Government;Immigration	Riflessioni sul  RAZZISMO:lo sappiamo sempre valutare per quel che è?	non sono sicura che si sappia cos'è in realtà il razzismo,ho spesso l'impressione che si faccia confusione,che si esasperino le cose,che la parola "razzismo" venga usata per qualunque cosa.   ESEMPIO:   pensiamo a questa frase:"il popolo X mi sta sul ****,quelli sono antipatici/rozzi/boriosi/maleducati ecc"-   ora,quando questa frase viene rivolta ad un popolo che è stato ed è sottoposto a discriminazioni e pregiudizi e vessazioni,tutti si infuriano e parlano di razzismo;   se viceversa questa frase viene rivolta ad un altro popolo,tutto tace.(chiaramente adesso sto generalizzando).   dunque mi viene in mente che,per una sacrosanta rivolta contro un razzismo che "storicamente" ha colpito certi popoli,ci sia una reazione che troppo spesso è esagerata e incoerente.   e che si tenda invece a "scusare",a prendere alla leggera insulti rivolti a certi altri paesi.

20090227060023AATl9A2	Politics & Government;Politics	Do Republicans need intervention for their problems from Dr Drew on 'Sober House'?	Here is a serious story about my old party:      Republicans Un-Hinged   by Paul Jenkins       In recent days, Republican leaders were called cheesy, off-putting, disastrous, untrustworthy, and inconsequential, not by Democrats, but by their party's own members, from high-profile commentators to Governors.      The highlight of the GOP week was, of course, Governor Bobby Jindal's response to Barack Obama's Congressional address. The best that can be said for Jindal's performance is that it channeled Kenneth the Page from 30 Rock, presumably not the objective, even for someone who willingly changed his name to "Bobby." But the past seven days have offered so many moments of breathtaking inanity by the GOP that our head spins at trying to organize them cohesively. With the country on the verge of being swallowed up in its entirety by the spiraling economy, Republicans obsessed over Obama's citizenship, gay people, pregnant women with HIV, helicopters, primary challenges to their own Senators from porn stars and Christian fundamentalists, registration forms, hopeless recounts, and assorted variations on the 1981 theme of "Government Is The Problem."

20070707100608AA3Q7Pv	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	In memoria dello stato di israele?	Oggi, Israele è lo stato più ricco e meglio armato del medio-oriente, nonchè l'alleato prediletto degli Stati Uniti.    Però, Israele è destinato a sparire dalle cartine geografiche. Perchè?    Semplicemente, ogni invasione-occupazione coloniale può durare soltanto un tempo limitato; cioè fino al momento in cui l'invasore viene fiaccato dall'opposizione sistematica e irriducibile degli indigeni e, suo malgrado, alza bandiera bianca.    Ovviamente gli amici (interessati) di israele rifiutano tale profezia; d'altronde, che s'aspettano? Un appoggio divino?       Per di più, la ricchezza o la forza (per quanto grandi come possono essere quelle israeliane) sono sempre relative e, soprattutto, limitate; in questo senso, il mondo ebraico-israeliano vive lo stesso declino di quello euro-statunitense (dal quale è nato e cresciuto)e    la crescita del capitalismo estremo-orientale (soprattutto, Cinese e Indiano) suonerà da marcia funebre tanto per gli israeliani quanto per i ricchi deretani di Europa e Stati Uniti.    La realtà, cioè, il prossimo futuro, non ride ad israele né ai suoi (interessati) amici.    I lupi sionisti continano pure a mordere, ma lo fanno sempre più stancamente... E tanto presto o tardi si ritroveranno sdentati!       (con largo anticipo): riposa in pace, Israele.

20090227060259AASwaUQ	Politics & Government;Government	Why do we continue to allow our elected officials to...?	ignore and violate the U.S. Constitution?  Are we that lazy and brainwashed to believe that freedom is something of the past and not for our future?  Isn't being your own person and having your sacred individual rights upheld important to you?  Also, do you consider the income you make from your job your personal property?  and if so, why would you allow the government to steal that property and give it to whom ever they choose without your consent?        I realize that we have to pay taxes for certain things like infrastructure, road and bridges that's not the question here.  Limited government was the objective of the founders of our country and paying tax for specific functions is Constitutional.  However, the Constitution only allows for 18 specific governmental functions and nothing more, the rest is up to the states and the people.  Isn't getting handouts/bailouts, courtesy of the working people, shirking all personal responsibility and accountability for ones' actions?  Why must we all pay for every failure and how is that morally correct? Sometimes bad things happen to good people but why does that mean that we must all share in everyone's misfortune equally? Please explain your moral reasoning as it relates to the Constitution.      Is there hope that all Americans will want to have their liberties and freedom?  Why would anyone want to be a slave?   Please, no hateful posts...This is to get everyone thinking about why our officials have chosen this path for us and whether it matches your particular set of values. And if it doesn't what should happen next?

"the defendant recklessly drove his vehicle racing at speeds of 80mph trying to catch micheal curry. Curry stole money from levine after he staged a drug deal. During the chase curry and levine did intentionally ram each others vehicles repeatedly the vehicles collided causing an accident. they spun out of control almost striking several vehicles operated by citizens thus recklessly creating a substantial risk of serious physical injury to the citizens and themselves. One of the vehicles that were almost struck had a 3 year old child passenger along with her mother"      the swerving out of control and 3 year old child(along with other cars almost hit) is ridiculous, no one was almost hit in the chase.      The only defense i can think of is i was young and stupid and involved in some things i shouldn't have been involved in      Id appreciate any information on these charges, if you have a link that would be great   also i was wonderig; if i do get a sentence would it be unrealistic to ask to begin the time after may 15th, when the semester ends?

A Government Accountability Office report released Tuesday night was requested by congressional oversight panels in advance of hearings on the program to be held Wednesday by the House Committee on Homeland Security.

20080925065843AAdWEC6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	To the LIBERAL finger-pointers, have you considered "pointing" at your own party?	This crisis was caused by political correctness being forced on the mortgage lending industry in the CLINTON era.      Before the DEMOCRATS' affirmative action lending policies became an embarrassment, the Los Angeles Times reported that, starting in 1992, a majority-DEMOCRATIC Congress "mandated that Fannie and Freddie increase their purchases of mortgages for low-income and medium-income borrowers. Operating under that requirement, Fannie Mae, in particular, has been aggressive and creative in stimulating minority gains."      Under CLINTON, the entire federal government put massive pressure on banks to grant more mortgages to the poor and minorities. CLINTON'S secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, investigated Fannie Mae for racial discrimination and proposed that 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers by the year 2001. Threatening lawsuits, CLINTON'S Federal Reserve demanded that banks treat welfare payments and unemployment benefits as valid income sources to qualify for a mortgage. That isn't a joke -- it's a fact. Meanwhile, economists were screaming from the rooftops that the DEMOCRATS were forcing mortgage lenders to issue loans that would fail the moment the housing market slowed and deadbeat borrowers couldn't get out of their loans by selling their houses.      A decade later, the housing bubble burst and, as predicted, food-stamp-backed mortgages collapsed. DEMOCRATS set an affirmative action time-bomb and now it's gone off.

20081119025651AAFCyb0	Politics & Government;Military	Should Gays serve openly in the military?	I was once married to a man that I loved dearly.  We married at a young age and it didn't work out.  I was naive at the time (6 years ago).  During our marriage, he did some things that made me think that he was "on the down low" with a guy friend of his.  To this very day, I still don't know the truth behind that.  Anyway, our divorce (process) tore me apart.  Fast-forward, about nine months after our divorce, I, myself, admittedly straddled the fence with my own sexuality (mentally, not physically).  Though, I truly believe that for me, it was out of pure hurt and a lack of confidence in men.  At the time I felt that a woman would be able to understand me better and that she wouldn't hurt me like a man already had.  Now, I have always been a Christian and felt that deep down, homosexuality was a sin, and not just "oops, I slipped up", but a "this is my lifestyle sin".  Somewhere down the road, I came to my senses and realized that "I am not gay", "I really do like men".  I also know a lot of other women that have gone through this in their lifetime.  As for hating gays as some think that we Christians do; for me this is not true. I don't agree with the lifestyle because I think that it is making a choice to live in sin.  I have never uttered these words to someone that I knew was gay, I feel that that would be wrong and cruel of me.  I do not think that I should impose my belief or my "God-fearing, lifestyle" on them.  However, I ask, why should their lifestyle be imposed on me?  Or more importantly why should it be imposed on my husband (who is in the military) or my son (if he ever decides to join the military)?  What is so wrong with the Don't Ask Don't Tell Policy?  What are your thoughts on this subject?              Sorry, if I gave TMI.  You don't have to read it, you can just answer the Introductory Question.

Just out of curiosity since one of the main arguments in this election is Obama has no experience what does McCain have up on him, because 20+ years in the senate is not executive and however many years in the armed forces isn't exactly good experience either. From what I remember about ex military and senators they weren't exactly the best presidents - corruption and poor decision making for cabinet.

My professor assigned the following question:      When you read through the first seven Articles please note those three or four phrases which, although apparently written in English, mean absolutely little or nothing to you: [HINT: Few modern Americans can read and understand ALL of the eighteenth-century English in which the Constitution was written . . . so you should not leave the spaces below blank. DO NOT focus on departures from standard 20th Century spelling. e.g. "controul" for "control."]       the question is confusing in itself, but I guess he just wants me to list the location of the confusing phrases. I can't find what I think he's looking for.      So, which parts in the 7 Articles make little sense nowadays due to language differencs?

I don't know for a fact if anything was actually said but I do know her sister-in-law doesn't like me and feels very protective of my nephews.  My sister never really cared for me either.

Russian scholar says US will collapse — next year      By MIKE ECKEL, Associated Press Writer Mike Eckel, Associated Press Writer – Wed Mar 4, 4:39 am ET      MOSCOW – If you're inclined to believe Igor Panarin, and the Kremlin wouldn't mind if you did, then President Barack Obama will order martial law this year, the U.S. will split into six rump-states before 2011, and Russia and China will become the backbones of a new world order.      Panarin might be easy to ignore but for the fact that he is a dean at the Foreign Ministry's school for future diplomats and a regular on Russia's state-guided TV channels. And his predictions fit into the anti-American story line of the Kremlin leadership.      "There is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010," Panarin told dozens of students, professors and diplomats Tuesday at the Diplomatic Academy — a lecture the ministry pointedly invited The Associated Press and other foreign media to attend.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090304/ap_o...
