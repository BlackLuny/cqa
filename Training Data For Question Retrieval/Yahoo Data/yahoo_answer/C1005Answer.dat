nxymxSUFaa	First of all Bonds hit 762 home runs.  As to whether anyone considers that to be the "record", remains to be seen.  Most fans don't!  Can Pujols pass that number, probably.  Ask this question in 5 years and the picture will be much clearer for all to see.<br>  <br>  Now that A-Rod's number don't mean anything, Albert may be our last, best hope for a "real" home run record.  For now most consider Hank Aaron's 755 career home runs as the record and Roger Maris 61 single season home runs as the record...........and so do I.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	How do you know Pujols isnt on the roids??????????!|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Prince Albert is superlative, but he's a more all-round hitter than just a long ball type.

He's going to need to stay healthy to have a shot.<br>  The thing I've always wondered about guys who are seeking the home run records is why they don't spend the last few years of their career in Colorado?

l5cxmTb9aa	The other guys are right. The chain popped off the front sprocket. You can either put it back on by hand or stand on the left side of the bike. pick the back up the bike up with your right hand, twist the left shifter with your left hand and turn the cranks with your right foot. After getting it back on have the shifter or derailleur checked to make sure the adjustment is correct.<br>  <br>  They're also right about swimmer. Almost every bike on the road is used. It's only new one time!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Looks like the chain came off the front chain ring.  Put the chain back on and try again.  You have to be pedaling when you shift gears and let up until it shifts.  Pull the little red gear down and forward to get slack in the chain.|`|YE87HP26aa	It appears your chain has come off of the front gears because you shifted so aggressively that the front derailleur (the device that moves the chain up or down the gears) moved the chain off the last gear and on to the frame.<br>  You have to pull the chain up on to the gears to fix it temporaly.<br>  You should also have it tuned up by a mechanic to fix this problem so it won't happen again.

oAjbBLDpaa	It was not Vincent McMahon. Anyone who said that does not truly appreciate it enough to do a bit of research.<br>  <br>  The actual beginning of it and the idea of this cannot truly be traced back to the real answer to this question. As it was said before, the olympics is probably the earliest we can trace it back to but it began to prosper with the carnival version of it done in early to mid 1800's (which is the genius behind Kizarny's gimmick by the way =)). Carnivals developed it until local promoters brought about businesses that based itself upon it and thus brought about the modern style of wrestling through the regional promotions. <br>  <br>  What Vincent Kennedy McMahon (to those who used him as an answer) did to wrestling was break the regional barrier and carry one company to an international base. An extraordinary feat, no doubt, but in doing so he lost much of the history of wrestling to appeal to the casual fan and it has now lowered to brawling be appreciated over ( in parts of the United States casual fan base at the very least, this is a large generalization and is not meant to offend) some of the great technical wrestling.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Wrestling with a predetermined outcome has been done since since the first olympics in greece and that goes back many hundreds of years and the current format started around the 1920's when people putting on pure wrestling shows didn't draw a crowd. no one person is credited with the creation but was done by carnival workers all around the US at that time.<br>  <br>  Vince McMahon... are you people serious?|`|AA11482019	It wasn't Vince McMahon.  Professional wrestling, in the sense of traveling performers paid for mass entertainment in staged matches, began in the post-Civil War period in the late 1860s and 1870s.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	To all those who answered Vince, I would just delete my answer.|`|AA10150940	I believe Smart Mark has it correct (first).<br>  <br>  But the thing that Vince Senior did do is pull many of the small regional groups into one larger group, when he created the WWF way back when.

Sorry I couldn't answer your question.|`|YyEOi1Tpaa	As a scripted art the profesional wrestling we know today as Smart Mark said first originated in carnival sideshows but it also started from music halls with mock combat, catch wrestling and theatre|`|H3nbC71eaa	Ron Simmons has something to say to all the answers that said Vince:<br>  <br>  <br>  DAMN!|`|lCzBONU1aa	Carnival wrestlers in the 1800s just decided to "work" the matches so they didn't risk hurting each other and they could do the same thing night in and night out to earn a living.|`|wMh38OzVaa	No Vince didn't created it.Don't know for sure but at one time most wrestling was real like boxing.But as times changed the Sport changed and more and more wrestlers stopped trying the really fight and began putting on staged shows just to make money.In the end to whole business went that way. That's what I think happened no proof of it thou.

6JE0mcrLaa	It really depends on the breed and what the horse is trained in. In this economy it really depends. You can get horse for free or horses that cost up to $35,000. An average price these days is anywhere from $2,500 to $6,000 or more for a jumper or dressage.<br>      Not only is there the cost for a horse but for feed, bedding, vaccines, vet, farrier, tack, grooming supplies, supplements, wormers, fly masks, sheets etc. The list goes on. Purchasing the horse is the most inexpensive part.<br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure what you mean by breaking in a horse...? Do you mean training, or you and your horse adjusting to each other?<br>  <br>  Horses are a big responsibility. An even bigger responsibility if he's on your property. If you were to board, you'd already have a stall, wash rack, cross ties, and an arena. You probably wouldn't have to take care of feeding or cleaning the stalls either. Because you would keep the horse on your property, you would need all of the things listed above, and they would be your responsibility. Do you have a place to exercise your horse? Wash them? Groom and tack them up? Make sure you are fully committed before getting a horse. Also, make sure you know how to ride, feed, muck out stalls, bathe, give wormers, and recognize equine illnesses.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Jenny, That's a big question/questions.

85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	You need to get a base and rings for it to add a scope. A simple Weaver style base works fine for a 10/22. Just buy a set of rings to fit the base and you're ready to mount the scope. If you buy the scope, mount and rings at a gun shop most will mount them for you at no charge. If you get them at Wal-mart or a store like that you'll have to do it yourself but it's not hard to do.|`|ruc14dO9aa	Like some have already said, the Ruger 10/22 usually comes with the *base* of a scope mount, but you will need to find suitable rings to fit the base (available from a VARIETY of sources).  If I were you, I'd decide what kind of scope you would like first, and get the rings (and a new base, *if* necessary) to fit the scope.  The main reason is, scopes have different dimensions, and it's better to have to search for better rings for your scope, than to try and find some kind of scope to fit your scope-rings!  If you wind up buying a high-quality scope, you should also give serious thought to having your scope-rings "lapped" so they don't damage or even 'bend' your scope!  This matters more for long-distance rifles (far in excess of the effective range of a 10/22), but if you choose to move your scope to a bigger rifle later, you don't want to bend it accidentally!<br>  <br>  One of my favorite places to look for Ruger 10/22 accessories is <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com.</a>  Brownell's usually has a few, as well as cabela's, and cheaperthandirt.com.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	It come with a base for the narrow .22 size rings. I suggest getting a regular size Weaver base(I think it's #TO-9 but the shop should have a book to check) as the rings made for them are usually more precise and durable. Either of the bases have proper length screws packed with them. Get Leupold Rifleman or normal Weaver rings of medium or low height and you should clear any scope with up to a 32mm objective lense. Don't forget to put a dab of Loctite(blue or green NEVER red) on each of the screws to keep them from vibrating loose over time.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Depends on how much you want to spend.

Bob get walked and Carl strikes out so Dave is on second and Bob on first.  At this time the offensive team realizes that Dave batted out of order and should be up now.  Since he's on base they'll skip his turn.  Had he made an out he would have batted again.

kjAsuC6Haa	Kurt Busch will have to move to another, better team if he wants to recapture his success; he's not going to do it with Penske. I don't know about Hamlin. I know he's with a better team than the others and has made the Chase, but he just doesn't seem focused or something. He probably has the best chance of coming back of the three. Ryan Newman--I hope he improves because I like him, but he's with an unproven team.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Denny has never missed the chase in his 3 full seasons.  The fact that he has had some bad racing luck during those last 10 races the last couple of years says nothing about his driving ability.  He has had the dominant car in quite a few races the last 2 years only to cut a tire or have some sort of mechanical issue.  This kid is every bit as talented as Kyle and might win his first cup championship before him.  Kurt needs to get out of those Dodges if he wants a chance to win another championship.  Ryan Newman should be better now that he is in a Chevy but we will have to see.  He is the one that I don't feel as good about, ability wise, out of the 3.  <br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|g4cYFVrmaa	Hamlin has a good owner and that will help him a lot.<br>  <br>  Newman is with a new owner and team; so I doubt he'll do anything any time soon.<br>  <br>  Busch is an odd one I believe he can win some races, but I don't think he'll win a cup again.|`|zYuDstYLaa	They ain't "has-beens" but I think each (possible exception of Hamlin who may get more) are going to get at most 10 more wins before retiring.

They are all still racing, doing better than a lot of drivers out there.  They all have rides with contracts to keep them going.  What is has been about that?  They are all doing just fine.  Did you see the race yesterday?<br>  <br>  *SHOQ*|`|Uaj4B84iaa	Bias alert, but I know Denny will gain back his early success. He's been hit with some crummy luck, but I think he's finally gaining focus and will be on the prowl. Kurt Busch is a great driver but, like others pointed out, should probably seek a better team. I like Ryan but I honestly don't know about him so I won't say anything. I would not call any of these drivers "has beens" though. They're all awesome in their own right.

g4QFDU6paa	I'm dismissing any system that has Rajon Rondo as more valuable than Chris Paul or Paul Pierce.  Sorry.
Y31Ci8vlaa	I need to say that the legs of male athletes are more stronger than that of female athletes.Male athletes have more power and they will be able to generate more speed from their legs.That is the reason you see usain bolt and no such in female athletes.As per the physical comparisons males are more stronger than females.Females dominate males only in their mental strength.You can look at the difference between the events and the performances of athletes.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Women have better lower body strength than they have upper body strength, but they are not stronger than men.<br>  That is easy to prove if you lift weights, and compare athletes of equal body weight.<br>  The male is stronger.<br>  <br>  What your boy friend can do or not do is not indicative of men who train. He should be able to do much more weight with his lower body.|`|mopWWQQiaa	I have been trying to figure this out for some time, too.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend has much stronger legs than me. She can leg press 500 lbs for reps, I can do around 350 if I push myself. But she weighs 25 lbs more than me and has bigger thighs, so I am not really surprised. Not to mention, my numbers are increasing slowly and steadily while hers don't seem to be increasing much from when she started. I'll eventually catch up to, and likely surpass her leg strength. By the way, people's leg press numbers tend to be higher than their squat numbers--not quite double, but maybe 25%.<br>  <br>  But your result is very strange and I would not ever expect it. All I can figure is that you are much more dedicated to your exercise than your boyfriend is. But, I can't for the life of me figure out how you could squat 450...surely this is not with a barbell. Squatting with a free barbell takes a lot of upper body strength, and 450 is no small weight. This is truly bizarre! However, I'd believe you if you said you did it on a machine.<br>  <br>  Then again, I have a friend who has roughly the same height and proportions as you. More than once, I saw her boyfriend climb onto her back and then she squatted a couple of times with him. But he doesn't weigh more than 170 lbs.<br>  <br>  This doesn't answer your question, but what I know is that in college, I see a lot of girls with very large, muscular-looking legs in the warmer weather. Some of them aren't even what you'd consider to be in good shape, and carry extra weight. These are the same girls who have big boobs; it's like everything about them is big, and they are the same height as me (5'9''). I even asked a question about this once on here. I have no idea what is causing this, but it is getting very common lately. And the guys generally appear to have thinner, less muscular legs. <br>  <br>  This still does not explain you though; you are tall, but not big, as you are thin. Then again, weight lifters are not always big; training heavy will allow a person to gain strength, but might not result in substantial muscle size increases.<br>  <br>  All I can figure is that we have a new breed of women who are altering their natural bodies through rigorous exercise. It seems that modern young women even look prettier/healthier due to the exercise (compared to pictures of their mothers when they were younger). I see a lot of women in the gym, so this makes sense. There is new research going on that is showing that huge amounts of testosterone aren't really needed for one to increase strength; huge muscles, yes, but strength, no. Therefore, women can become very strong, but they just won't get big like men will. And the upper limit for strength is known to be higher in men. But women can still rival men in the lower body, where strength seems fairly comperable between the sexes. The one thing I still don't understand is why women seem to be able to develop such proportionately large leg muscles compared to the smaller size of their knees than men. You often see men and women who workout. The guy is much taller and broader in the upper body, but the woman's legs are proportionately larger when you factor in her smaller build.<br>  <br>  I think I brought up more questions than answers.

LnJjS8BRaa	What did the parlour say? I've heard you shouldn't be stressing it for a week or so. Even without direct impact you'll be using the muscles a lot and your gear with me pressing and rubbing against it as you move. I've heard this can effect the pigment and ruin the tattoo. Call the place you got it and ask them. They'll know best.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pLsQdLl3aa	It will still be fairly sore. Maybe worse then that depending on how you took care of it. You might be starting the scabbing over phase, but it will be pretty early for that i think. As it is in a spot on you that wil be doing a lot of stretching and flexing i'd say if it is scabbing over and you think it will flex to the point it would break or split the scabs then, yes, it could cause damage to the tattoo. i would sit out sparring all together. getting kicked in it will raise the likely hood you will cause some sort of damage to the scab. <br>  <br>  Friend of mine took 2 weeks off tang soo do when he got his. and he is a 7 day a week guy. My advice, play it by ear but don't push it. It's gonna be with you a while|`|6qMaZ0N4aa	No it should not harm your tatoo, just cover it up with seran wrap or similar and some sort of cream to keep it moist and the wrap will keep both sweat out as well as keep your uniform from rubbing and irritating it.  After it heals you will be OK then, till then though keep it moist and cover it when you must.
l0iCqzlQaa	yes.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't, I think they'll either be in first or 2nd.  I mean, you're talking about a young team, who's players are only getting better, and they have fairly the same team.<br>  <br>  I think that the Yankees are going to finish in 3rd.  They made a lot of off season moves, but in all honesty, I don't think they'll help.  They have no chemistry, they'll have a TON of pressure to finish first with that payroll, and their pitching is still suspect.  Sabathia has had problems in the past in the postseason (ie pressure situation) and he's coming off a season when he pitched so many innings, that I doubt he'll be as effective.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Switch the Yanks to #3, the Rays to #4 and the Jays to the surprise #2 spot.

oPbLcfKoaa	I had to go waaay back in the archives for this one.<br>  <br>  RetBar Manufacturing of Peoria Arizona made trike conversions for bicycles. Schwinn eventually either copied or bought the rights to the design which made it's way onto their "Town and Country" model. This goes back a-ways.<br>  <br>  American Beauty is an oooold name and was probably the bike that Custom Cycle Co. used to do the conversion. I don't recall with absolute certainty if American Beauty was a brand made by CC or not.<br>  <br>  I've noticed that a bikes which include a RetBar conversion, pretty much regardless of condition (but I imagine in "used but rideable" shape) ser bringing in the area of $150. I'll try to locate more info and post it on my archives.

poc3xrCeaa	The blood wasn't real if you look on youtube for fake blood wwe you can clearly see the ref handing a blood capsule to Mr.Kennedy so i would say it was put on flair before the cameras were put on.

aYVPZjLVaa	Union has much more contact (rucking, mauls, contested scrums). But league has more violent hits (shoulder charges). As for differences play continues after the tackle (ie people fight for the ball in a ruck most of the time) there is no set number of phases, shoulder charges are illegal, try is worth 5 conversion 2 and in game drop goal or penalty is worth 3, there are 15 players on the field, scrums include flankers and a no8 and are contested (either team may gain control of the ball), lineouts (as opposed to a scrum for out of bounds), much more in play kicking and a greater variety of kicks (league rarely uses grubber, up and under, or other kicks beyond a basic punt for yardage). I'm sure I missed a lot (most on purpose because it would take so long) but that should be most of the basic differences.|`|1K2VCtrLaa	Well i've played both personally i prefer union.<br>  <br>  Union definitely has more contact because you can ruck and maul where as in league you can't.<br>  <br>  There isn't as much running in union as there is in league but its more physically tiring.<br>  <br>  Ans in union you tend to kick the ball alot more than in union.|`|K4rP4A0naa	Union is more constant contact because the defensive line is very close to the attacking players, whereas in league the defence has to be10 metres in front of the play-the-ball, therefore there's the possibility for bigger hits. Both are very rough though, unless your a winger haha.|`|g6b6vScPaa	Union has far more contact but league has bigger hits|`|c86DKQyUaa	Depends what position your going to play, theres a lot more contact in union for the forwards than in league because youv gotta work to contest or keep possesion, so if you dont like the contact stay on the wing.|`|Q7wEg0boaa	Union|`|0xfVyxxIaa	Rugby league is much rougher and has more contacts... and consequently injuries.|`|YDXITLv1aa	iv played both for a few years.<br>  <br>  league is a rougher sport than union<br>  <br>  you get tackled far more times, and you often have 2 or 3 people tackling you at once.<br>  <br>  shoulder charges are also legal in league whereas they are illegal in union.<br>  <br>  its also a harder sport than union.<br>  <br>  a lot more running involved.
KVCabHoeaa	Well swimming isn't going to MAKE someone taller. The only thing that I can think of that would affect height is diet - if you don't have proper nutrition when you're growing, you can end up shorter. <br>  <br>  I don't know if there's any correlation between height and swimming (i.e. not sure if it's a coincidence), but if there IS a correlation, it would be that being taller makes you a better swimmer and not the other way around!|`|lcpLAS3Kaa	Having extra height and a bigger build definitely helps when your swimming. I notice that on breaststroke especially that the girls with bigger builds have the lowest times.|`|PJec1EfGaa	im short & i always have a tough time keeping up with the taller girls. but swimming doesn't make you taller, its your natural build! <br>  <br>  (:|`|pWz8d8MBaa	it just must be the swimmers u know i know short swimmers.|`|B1egWmSNaa	Well, tall people make good swimmers so most swimmers are tall. I know short swimmers too...but they are slower.|`|zmhQdYbDaa	There is a reason why most swimmers are tall, but not the fact that they swim. In the world of competitive swimming where milliseconds decide between gold and silver, winning and losing, the extra height makes a huge difference.<br>  <br>  More height makes for a greater reach, usually more power, and a greater extension over the water. Bigger feet act as flippers, bigger hands catch more water, and a longer torso glides over the water easier. <br>  <br>  Therefore the most famous swimmers are tall, as being tall gives you a big advantage in swimming.|`|lgBD4BS0aa	Most of the people on the swim team that i was on weren't really tall. Most of them were between 5ft and 5ft 5in.

OdFnHVbhaa	You really need to just run a lot. I was the same way i ran decent 10 and 20 times, 40 was in the same ballpark and i had trouble with the 100. I just ran everyday, had protein and worked out.  If you run a good 2 miles a day you will gain speed and endurance. Another way to improve endurance is jump rope. It whips you into shape and shaves off almost 3/10 a second off nearly every sprint.|`|e4ekb1amaa	Don't focus too much on lifting - focus on drills that build your legs for power and explosiveness. In doing so, you'll increase the stamina of your muscles. From the sounds of it, you either simply lack a good top speed or are out of shape..... My guess would be it's a healthy dose of both. <br>  <br>  Running hills helps a lot. <br>  <br>  Another good sprinting drill is sprint 10 yards. Stop. Reset. Sprint the 10 back to the start. Sprint 20. Stop reset, sprint back, reset, sprint 30 etc, etc until you get up to 100.<br>  <br>  Also, doing footwork/agility drills can help you - you can only go as fast as your feet move you!<br>  <br>  Also, try adding some light jogging to your workout regime. Nothing too big, but run a mile or 2 after lifting, just to get your legs some work, and your heart pumping. It'll do wonders to your physique, and will help you build stamina. <br>  <br>  In any case, don't focus on your 40 time too much unless you're running track. There much more than speed drills to playing football. Sure, they can help, but doing "football" drills would be much more beneficial for you.|`|qsKOlpUyaa	Have you been checked by a doctor for bronchial asthma?<br>  (What? You don't believe all these HS freshmen and sophomores on this site who want to get their forty time down to 4.4 from 4.6?)|`|fabf3a4ab60d6117be9407e330339181aa	When I was in H.S. my 40 time went from 4.9 to 4.5 by just getting in better shape and doing this simple drill.  Run at a constant speed for 30 sec then sprint for 30.  You can change up the time a little, but as long as you variate your speeds you work both types of muscle.  Should work as long as you don't halfa@* it.
mml9J88caa	no i usually get cheep seats if i have to buy. then after the third inning is when i usually will be looking to see what seats are still open then i just sit down in them. no one has ever came up to me. sometimes before you walk down to your seats they have th people that work there and they ask to see your tickets. but i have said oh i dont know where my seat is, or i lost it.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	I never been caught but me and my friends used to go all over the the ballpark, first, second, and third level.|`|huAm27beaa	Nothing happens they ask you to move then you find better seats wait till the 4th inning to do so|`|yk4S7uuraa	Never happened. I've yet to see anyone thrown out expect for running on the field; or being really drunk.|`|axxQzOCHaa	It's yet to happen, but I did this while at a Giants - Dodgers game years ago. I waited until the 8th inning, that might have helped.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Usually,   we chalk it up to a misunderstanding the first time,  and escort you back to your own seats.   It depends if you will get a 2nd chance should you move out again (depending on how far away,   for example I will be rather blunt and have little patence for a guy with a upper deck seat who is in a seat 3 rows behind the plate).   If you do it several times,  and are known for it,  you will get the boot.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind though,  it all depends if someone notices and complains (aka,  the one with the ticket for that seat).   Its not uncommon for scalper seats to remain unsold,  and a bunch of decent field level seats stay empty for the game.   In this case,  its also not uncommon to see them fill up with people moving.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	Definitely Stone Cold all the way ! For sure he was a gifted and charismatic wrestler who became the figurehead of the legendary Attitude Era.He worked an intense style of power brawling wrestling that incorporated mat-based manoeuvers.Stone Cold had stength,stamina, endurance and the ability to brawl and then come straight back at his opponent.For sure Goldberg couldn't compete on the same level or beat the Texas Rattlesnake.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMxCjVnG1jg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMxCjVnG1...</a>|`|WQGvE60waa	Austin.<br>  <br>  Goldberg was supposed to be a knock-off of Austin<br>  <br>  Golberg failed agaisnt true wrestlers like Sting and Bret Hart.<br>  <br>  Austin didn't<br>  <br>  The only reason Goldberg beat sting wuz cuz Kevin Nash interfeared but I saw him tapping to the Scorpion Death Lock during that Nitro Match|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Goldberg wasn't much of a wrestler at all. He was successful only because he sold well and was easily marketable. Stone Cold wasn't much of a technical wrestler but prior to breaking his neck in the botched piledriver, he was actually a good wrestler in my opinion. Stone Cold was both more successful and a better wrestler than Goldberg.<br>  <br>  Stone Cold still makes appearances but he won't be wrestling, except for a small possibility of one last match at the upcoming Wrestlemania, due to his injuries and Goldberg is, I think, starting to wrestle again but I doubt the WWE will hold any interest in him because, from all I see in him, he could do a good spear and that was all.|`|aXdGCbEDaa	I feel that Goldberg is a much better mat wrestler than Austin.Stone Cold was mainly a brawler,while Goldberg was much more skilled in technical wrestling.Stone Cold however,had a much btter gimmick,and a bit more charisma than Goldberg did.In terms of who's been most successful, I'm gonna give it to Austin,he was one of the wrestlers who made the Attitude Era and WWF do great.As for whether or not they'll come back,Austin is under contract with WWE but due to the neck problems that he has,I doubt that he'll come back and wrestle again after WM25,which is rumored to be his last match.As for Goldeberg,he's getting old now and I don't think that he's interested in coming back to the WWE,but ey,I'd welcome him to come back anyday!|`|3I6YUfg0aa	NO CONTEST! STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN!|`|9ijwrcTZaa	Austin by far............|`|c614aa36f47781f6160bcceaebb97251aa	Austin, because he was tough as hell, a brawler, had no quit in him. He worked his *** off to get to the top.  I think Austin would win in a match between him and Goldberg, because Goldberg may be tough, but Austin's even tougher, he wouldn't beat Austin that easily. Goldberg's matches usually last 2 minutes, but he won't get that with Austin, because Austin wouldn't quit so easy.|`|AA10150940	Austin was the better wrestler.<br>  <br>  Goldberg (although I really did like him) was one of the many football players who converted to wrestling after football.<br>  <br>  I don't believe either will ever return in any meaningful way.<br>  <br>  I think Goldberg has too many burnt bridges and Austin's knees are too torn up.|`|Z10Oed2faa	goldberg didnt really wrestle much or long matches<br>  he got dominated then did a spear to a jackhammer <br>  <br>  plus goldberg messed up bret hart|`|yhqa5FIXaa	Goldberg was the ****!!!!!!

I highly doubt that either will return to a full-time schedule, but in their respective "primes" Austin was also a greater draw.  As for who would win, it would be down to the promoters.|`|aNhzynIYaa	As far as wrestling went i'd say Goldberg. Austin could sell a bigger crowd no doubt. Just look at how things went for WWE during the Attitude era.<br>  But Austin just punched and hit people off of things. At least Goldberg mixed it up with kicks, power moves and submissions. Takes a strong guy to military press Brock Lesnar or Jackhammer the Big Show(Giant as he was in WCW). Never seen Austin show that kind of strength. All be it Goldberg's non PPV matches were abit on the short side. At least it wasn't 30minutes of two men punching each other, doing the same in different spots.<br>  So Goldberg wrestler. Austin better character.|`|poc3xrCeaa	Austin would win i think at his peek he was great no disrespect to Goldberg. And Austin still makes regular appearances for wwe usually around wrestlemania because of his ability to bring in the fans. As for goldberg i doubt we will ever see him on wwe television again.

zg1lIy7Oaa	1. Toronto Raptors<br>  Coming into this season, many NBA experts believed that the Raptors would be ready to breakout onto the scene and make noise in the playoffs. Not have the Raptors not broken out, they look to be out of the playoff picture completely. <br>  <br>  2. Houston Rockets<br>  The Rockets had NBA championship aspirations when the season started. However, now with Tracy McGrady looking like he’s about 45 years old and Ron Artest looking close to retirement, the Rockets appear a long ways away from a championship. <br>  <br>  3. Detroit Pistons<br>  The trade for Allen Iverson was supposed to inspire and invigorate the Pistons. Instead, the trade has basically ruined what the Pistons had going. With no Chauncey Billups to spread the ball, the chemistry is bad and Iverson’s me-first attitude just makes things worse. <br>  <br>  4. Phoenix Suns<br>  Unlike a lot of teams in the Western Conference, the Suns have stayed relatively healthy. And despite getting a good year from Shaq, Phoenix is floundering. If they don’t get it turned around quickly, Steve Kerr will probably have to make another trade.<br>  <br>  5. Philadelphia 76ers<br>  The Sixers are still in the playoff hunt but there’s one big problem — they are a worse team with Elton Brand. Brand, the free agent who the Sixers signed in the offseason to a gigantic contract, slows down the teams and makes them easier to guard. That harsh reality is overshadowing their current playoff hopes.|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Detroit Pistons<br>  Washington Wizards<br>  Golden State Warriors|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	THE PISTONS!!!!!!!!!!!!

cOPCNP7Laa	Disagreed. ONE OF the top defenses yes. Not THE top. Yes they played crap vs Brazil but we also had Chiellini missing (Materazzi doesn't start anymore Darkie :P)<br>  <br>  However it is hard to say who has the top defense. For example, which other team if ANY has so far conceded ZERO GOALS from Spain (other than in penalty shoot-out) in the last 1 to 2 years?  People tend to forget Spain went through only on a penalty shoot-out. Hardly a big show of strenght and superiority. But if they're classified as having "the best midfield" and "the best striker in the world" in Villa then that says a lot about Italy's defense.<br>  <br>  Edit Silas: I didn't say nor imply that Spain's defense is bad. Idk how u got that impression.<br>  <br>  Edit Darkie: Matrix doesn't even start for Inter no more and he was a symbol of the club in their last two Scudetto wins<br>  <br>  @ Arsenal Trophy Cabinet: Maybe you don't watch Real Madrid and haven't realized Cannavaro was at the heart of their defense in last year's La Liga title and has been doing really well paired up with Pepe in their resurrection this year...<br>  Oh yeah I forgot. You're so prejudiced about Italy you wouldn't see regardless...|`|VpiYSQVnaa	no you can't deny it, those players are the wall of the team...but *ahem* arent u forgetting to praise somebody?<br>  <br>  lol i know he's a midfielder, i just wanted to hear u praise him :P<br>  <br>  vvv true|`|jLRpCt03aa	Cannavaro is nowhere near as good now as he was in the WC. Same with Zambrotta and how on earth is Materrazi a top defender with his yellow/red card collection? The guy that said Italy is not the Top Defence anymore is right and you didnt mention Chiellini, he's worth more than those other guys. Anyway Spain has great defenders + Number 1 GK and  if we talk about individual skills (club level play) I think its France: Evra, Abidal, Clichy, Sagna etc., Frey on goal.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	They are all amazing but honestly you cannot say their the best currently.<br>  :D I mean theirs Argentina, Brasil, Espana, and much more.<br>  I mean half the reason why Italy are such a great team is because of Buffon and their defense. But currently its not them.<br>  <br>  @Marco so are you trying to say that Espana's defense is crap?<br>  <br>  @Marco oh wait nevermind sorry :)|`|PsCS0GK3aa	you mean that short bald guy who hasn't been heard from since summer 2006 and that shawn marion (nba star) nickname stealer who is a disaster waiting to happen? o.O<br>  <br>  <br>  The only thing I remember about that short bald guy was Messi scoring a great goal while the defender hopelessly slid into his own goal.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Best next to Brazil's...|`|VhgyQES9aa	They are best for sure but Cannavaro on the way out, look for Oddo to step up more|`|HkqiGEMuaa	I wish I can..

dgialQHeaa	I agree with your observation, however i do not think they are better for these reasons. <br>  <br>  1. Garnett  is a jump shooter which means that if the screens are not there for allen & rondo the need another wing scorer so unless your saying that they need a R. Hamilton or Kevin Martin type player so suppliment Pierce's wing scoring when the penitration is not they will most likely not be able to perform like this for a whole season. not to mention NO pick & pop is gonna work with Perkins or Powe. <br>  <br>  2. weather he is 6'11 or 7'1 (measurments change every few years) KG is basically a 7 footer and pretty well the only big man that commands significant defensive attention on their roster.  Powe, Davis, & Perkins will get in to foul trouble defending bigger centers & power forwards.  This also leaves a huge rebounding void for the celtics. Big Ben & Lebron would have a 2nd chance point field day in a 7 game ECF that would most likely only last about five not to mention a 7'3 center that they have in the middle.  <br>  <br>  3. Bostons offense is not about talent, it's about their system, what talents do Paul, KG, and Ray have that Shaq, STAT & Nash don't, or that Duncan Parker and manu don't. the answer is none. They are just more cohesive. Which is why Ray's numbers go up so much without KG it's a supplemental scoring option. They win games based on D and as I mentioned in # 2 they are at a huge loss defensively without him Ray & Paul make it very difficuly for an  offense dependant on a wing scorer like Cleavland & LA which is why KB & LBJ struggled last year in the playoffs, but without KG they become Bowen & Manu, meaning it's not impossible to dominate you as a offensive player so unless they play a 1-3-1 zone or a 2-3 and overplay everything all game without getting winded.  They are subject to giving up points in the paint, and when the game is slowed down they would be a lot like the suns without a STAT.  Which is why they need those extra two passes to create when the pace is not what it was yesterday.  The floor needs to be balanced when they are not in transition as well.<br>  <br>  4.Overall i think the celtics are not better but different without KG.  KG makes the a championship team instead of what we have seen the kings, suns & pistons have been in recent years good but just barely not good enough. <br>  <br>  nice observations though we should do an nba halftime show together LOL|`|CTAXzZBMaa	sad|`|cR4W88GYaa	That doesn't make them better. The Celtics are a defensive team not an offensive team so they don't want to score that quick. KG brings work ethic, leadership, intensity, and presence meaning rebounds and blocks. Nobody will out work him. If they played a team like the Lakers or Spurs in the finals, who is gonna stop their big men? KG. There are certain styles that work for certain teams and fast paced isn't for the Celtics just like slow paced isn't for the Suns as we seen earlier this year. And thats why you aren't an NBA analyst lol.|`|AA11488609	Well they are running more without Garnett.  KG isn't slow, but his game is more half court than Rondo's. whose game is more speedy.  With KG, Rajan has adapted well to the half court.<br>  <br>  Either way, the Celtics are good at adjusting tempo of games, which is crucial for a winner.|`|i5MInqeMaa	There good, but not better without KG.  Using the Suns game is not a good judge of how good the celtics are.  The suns played terrible defense.  The worst PG in the league could of put 30 against that defesne.  They need KG against good teams that play defense.  As somebody already said, the lost to the jazz when kg went down.  Lakers, Cavs, Rocket, Magic, and jazz would all be teams that would be able to handle the cletics witout KG.|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	Ok, they have a few good games, but in the long run into the playoffs they will lose w/o him. For crying out loud if they didn't need him, why did they trade for him. He is more than someone holding on to the ball. There is alot more than he does on the floor, he is one of their leaders. And come playoff time, his experience will give them an edge.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Without KG the Celtics become a more perimeter oriented team that runs. When the shooters are hot that offense is far more potent, because Rondo is at his best full speed dishing to shooters. Plus the Celtics have guys who can hit a 3, in Allen, Pierce, House, Pruitt, and even Scal on occasion.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Its fine in the regular season... But In The Playoffs they would be DEAD without KG...<br>  Playoff BasketBall is a hole different game and you need a Big Man 2 be Competitive...|`|kFcdwVwdaa	excuse me boy, when did KG get hurt? against the Utah Jazz, right? THEY LOST. when the celtics played the lakers at boston and lost KG to fouls in the fourth, THEY LOST. can you give me a list of the games that KG didn't play and against who? you should make more sense of what you say. they need KG. Phoenix doesn't play defense yet, so you are expected to win a team like that, since you still have defense on your team. But seriously think about what you say.
GswnLKtQaa	It's not his forte, he's become more of a pure shooter so you can see less penetration from him and unlike d-wade he doesn't have good handles and speed.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Because not only he has knee problems that he's a pure shooter and is old and doesn't had the speed as he used to in the Bicks and Sonics.The Celtics Doc Rivers is keeping him out of this things because he like Ray's touch and he's more to use it but we all know that Ray drives to the basket|`|EKF2HdZKaa	because that is ray allens role as a celtic<br>  ray can drive but he is there to knock down shots,all the celtics are to do their job becuase if they do they are a great team|`|1KPKEsHsaa	Because he's getting older.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Because wade is more physically better than Ray Allen.

Pc0QjrQ4aa	I sit in section 114 hoping to see the kids get better (let me briefly polish up that turd a bit), and have known all year that, barring some sort of miracle (roughly the entire team having a collective career year) that the playoffs were not going to happen.  Look for the 30ish guy with the Mr Clean haircut sitting in a row of charming and funny older guys (60's/70's; all vastly smarter, funnier, and more charming than me).  We've all pretty much gone in this year knowing the playoffs are fantasy.  Most of the folks I see regularly at games understand the deal.  I can't and won't speak for other people.<br>  <br>  Even Don Cherry keeps referencing "oh, wait until the Irishman (Burke) has been in for a couple years...then you watch."  Not exactly the stuff of "let's print those playoff tickets".<br>  <br>  That MLSE did not budget for any home playoff dates...pretty much made it easy to book that mid-April golf trip in Myrtle Beach.<br>  <br>  Fletcher, for me, did an underrated job of shedding payroll during the summer, and did the best he could to get picks during last year's trade deadline (the guys with NMC/NTC clauses were never going to leave...that's their right).<br>  <br>  Burke should think similarly, and apparently is.  I've said that other than Schenn and maybe Pogge, there's nobody who, for the right price, isn't trade-worthy.  If a team comes in with some silly offer for Kaberle and its on his approved list...see ya Tommy.  Blake...JFJ overpaid.  Antropov...gone.  Kubina...if he waives his NMC, see ya.  They have some other guys who I do like watching (White, Jeremy Williams, Moore, Stajan, etc.) but again...if some GM is going to throw a prospect and a draft pick...toodleoo!<br>  <br>  I know that Leafs fans (okay, I'll admit it) deservedly have a bad rap for being...more than a touch delusional.  I'm a Leafs fan to the bone.  It's going to take them another couple years to improve (as in not next year).  They need to follow the model of Washington and Chicago.  Get young, fast, skilled, and physical (it might help if they could pull a Washington and draft a Hart Trophy winning winger and a potential Norris Trophy defenceman in the first round).  For years their drafting was...how do I put this...a joke.<br>  <br>  I don't know who these people on Y!A are, but I can assure you that I am not one of them.  <br>  <br>  As a fan, I expect that they go out, and compete every night to the best of their ability.  With a few stinkers, they've done that.  Their skill level is in the bottom 1/3 of the league.<br>  <br>  Please feel free to print this and send it to any of my fellow Leafs fans.|`|yRT5HjF0aa	I'm here! I'm here!<br>  <br>  While there is the select few who refuse to give up hope on the season and think no matter what we will win the Stanley Cup, I think most had realized right from the beginning of the season that this year, and the next few years, are rebuilding years for Toronto. Anybody who thinks otherwise is just delusional. Cliff Fletcher and Brian Burke didn't need to tell us that the Leafs would be bad this year, we already knew and expected the worst. <br>  Right now if the Leafs were to try and make the playoffs, they'd probably get rid of some of their draft picks to acquire a rental player. Then they'd try to make a late season surge for the playoffs, which would make them go up in the draft, and they would probably fall just flat of cracking the final berth. <br>  While it is difficult to see your team suck, I'd rather go through with this a few more years, build a good team, and then contend for the Stanley Cup rather than get veterans, barely crack the 8th spot, only to get defeated in the 1st round.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	People who ask about the Leafs winning the cup are not even a fan of the Leafs. They just want to poke at the team for not winning the cup for over 42 years when their team probably haven't won the cup yet.|`|UoUaO52taa	They don't use Yahoo or need to ask|`|2iuZdBXraa	I think most Leaf fans were realistic about the team's chances this year even before the season started (any Leaf fan I talked to was not optimistic, including myself).  No real big names and a lot of young inexperienced players.  We didn't expect Wilson and Burke to turn it around over night, we knew their goals and expectations for this team.  I don't think you can totally judge a fan base by what you see in Yahoo Answers.  I mean, how many times did we see "Who's going to win the Cup?" back in November.  I guess it's kind of expected to see these types of questions in here when there's a difference in age and hockey knowledge from one asker to another.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	We're still around. The real fans don't ask stupid questions. They don't want to act like Red Wing or Pens fans. <br>  We enjoy the new style Leafs and wonder what will happen at the trade deadline. Even trying to lose we can't get as bad as Ottawa or Tampa Bay or Atlanta or .... <br>  The true Leaf fan is sitting back and watching what Burkie is going to do. We are watching our favourite players getting placed for trades and have quiet cheers for places like Saint Louis, Vancouver and Colorado. We will not make the playoffs this year. Probably not even next year but we will challenge before Philadelphia, the Islanders, and the Senators.|`|xIx1XrGfaa	Real Leaf fans have given up paying attention to the media because it's to damn depressing. It doesn't help that real fans can't afford to go the games either. I mean seriously, would ANY real fan (doesn't matter the team) start leaving the game in the BEGINNING of the 3rd period cause their team is losing? Not being a leaf fan, I have to laugh every time I hear it mentioned during the game.|`|AA10068004	In case they missed the news to support point "b", here is a reminder published on NHL.com today. He is looking "long-haul", unless something "is offered that get's them in the playoffs and not affect their long-term plans".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=410667" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=41066...</a>|`|9ujT56Maaa	We're hiding.<br>  <br>  Your points are absolutely true, but some fans are eternal optimists.  Toronto fans doubly so.  There's not much we can do to disillusion them, so most of us are just letting them go on with it.|`|AA11514493	hmm..how do I explain properly, yet briefly..<br>  I 'follow' the Leafs because of location. Living in the GTA, I can't help but hear how they are doing. I am a 'hockey fan.' Given the 'hometown edge' my heart leans toward the Leafs. However, as a fan, I appreciate watching a team that gives its all every single game, win OR lose.<br>  Haven't seen that with the Leafs the past few years. One or two players have done so, but it takes 6 on the ice to keep my interest.<br>  I found it very refreshing to hear both Fletcher and Burke admit what they did, and it got my attention. I certainly have no illusions of the Leafs being contenders for a time, but it will be interesting to see how the team evolves. The first part of the season had my wife and I both glued to our seats because the effort, the heart, was evident. And yet..once again, it seems to have 'dried up.' If they would play like they did at the first of the season, then there would be no question. But until the 'ownership' stops thinking 'profit only' and begins to think 'fan base,' then I won't be just a 'Leaf fan'.<br>  sigh. and yet, even so, there were several fist pumps watching the game last night. THAT was hockey!<br>  I know I'm not the only one hoping that Burke does have the autonomy they gave Colangelo...maybe Harold's ghost can finally be exorcised.<br>  I know I didn't explain well enough, and I am sorry for that..but to do so would take a lot more than space than we have here.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	I've been answering Leaf questions all season and I've never suggested that the team could or should make the playoffs.  I've always said that they had to trade the entire team (except Schenn) and start all over from scratch.  I've even suggested that the Leafs are more than two or three years from contending.  They need to get anything they can for every player on the roster and begin the rebuilding process from scratch.  By doing so, you remove a bunch of guys who have repeatedly shown that they don't have enough talent to make the playoffs, and you can rebuild the team under a single vision - Brian Burke's.  In years gone by, anybody the Buds were going to pick up had to please Tannenbaum and Peddie before their GM could say a word.  That filter has completely destroyed any sense of identity and character on the team.<br>  One GM<br>  One coach<br>  Five years <br>  Then maybe the Leafs will contend.

l0Sf1oIkaa	Could be similar to what Tedy Bruschi had. Tedy had a hole in his heart, which caused his stroke. Sad story.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	He probably has a leak in a valve.  I am guessing that it is the mitral valve as that is less serious than an aortic valve leak.  Many years ago a wide receiver with Detroit went on a route and just collapsed and died.  His last name, I think, was Hughes.  I think that death may go back 20 years or more.  But, it was a cardiac death and was reported to be a type of problem that could happen to a young adult walking down the street.  The article I read about Mandeville was weak on meaningful facts about the guy's health problem.  You cannot tell what the problem is from what I read.  Nobody is asking for a cardiologist to write a sports article; but, a sports writer should have consulted with the combine and a detailed medical report supplied.  But, you have the confidential materials problem.  Most of us out here do not know anything about an A-10 Conference football player.  Weak article.
4uW1QdMpaa	The Knicks as well as alot of the teams in the NBA are trying to free up massive amounts of cap space just to prepare and try to sign a big named star in the 2010 offseason... <br>  <br>  They are all looking for someone to build a team around<br>  They want to keep a couple of key pieces that would help with a championship... and then get the big named player to carry the load, and win the franchise a title...<br>  <br>  But yes, its February 2009... there is still half of this season left, and another whole season before the "stars" like Wade, LeBron, and Bosh become free agents... i mean sure.. with the big named stars they are there will be alot of hype about if they are going to move, since all three have played for the same team their whole careers... but yes... for it only being Feb. 09.. there is WAAAAAAY to much hype going on about LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Stoudemire... among others.. changing teams in the 2010 offseason|`|714cba240d17420c308fc51bd5b0160caa	i believe it is talked about WAY too much. Lebron will probably sign with the Cavs for a few more years when his contract is up and the whole 2010 thing will be viewed as a bust and nobody will get anything. Chris Bosh might move but that will be just about it.|`|KJxUCqFpaa	It is being way overhyped, I think that most of these superstars will end up signing extensions before that summer comes<br>  Lebron will stay with Cleveland,D-Wade will stay with the Heat,Amare will stay with the Suns, Bosh might move though|`|2dnuQ3iyaa	No because it could shake up the NBA and there isnt that much to talk about until the playoffs|`|AA11939728	It has the potential to be overhyped every year... this year is no different<br>  <br>  but it should be noted that there is always the possibility that a major trade shakes up the playoffs|`|NWXBqftkaa	Which of all the free agents are actually unrestricted free agents?|`|PjFLDSmdaa	NY fans are going to be VERY upset when it comes to 010. Why would any superstar want to go to team with no one...Lebron already had to go through rebuilding on his team. What makes them think he'll go through it again just to play at MSG? If he leaves Cleveland it will be to a competitive team that gives him a chance at the finals, and he'll only leave if Cleveland hasn't gotten him a ring. Which hopefully this year....well, we'll see :).

ElH6jMEXaa	I think this would be a very good fight, and I think Cotto wins it on points.  Clottey is a pressure fighter, but he is limited, Cotto has shown the ability to deal with pressure guys (even in his loss to Margarito I thought he was boxing very well).  Cotto has also shown very underappreciated boxing ability.<br>  <br>  I think Cotto would be able to deal with Clottey's attack, it becomes predictable, and Cotto has enough power to hurt him and wear him down to the body.  <br>  <br>  Cotto seems to be very strong mentally, the type of arrogance that doesn't allow his ego to bruise - and the controversy with Margarito I think only helps him...in his mind he has to be thinking that it took 2 loaded gloves and over 30 mins for Margarito to win.<br>  <br>  Clottey is a terrific welterweight, and could certainly pull off a victory, but I still think Cotto is the cream of the crop, his victory of Mosley should only serve to magnify that based on Shane's destruction of Margarito.|`|4432bf9b709422220cc7a44ccbf8f500aa	Clottey nearly beat Margarito with two busted hands.  Margarito pounded on Cotto with LOADED hands. <br>  <br>  I think Clottey will be able to weather the early Cotto storm. . . and end the fight with a unanimous decision. . . without having to cheat in order to do it.|`|AA11176841	would be a great fight, it would finally give clottey the fights he deserves if he comes out with a win,<br>  <br>  personally i think cotto would win, but clottey needs to be given a chance, to many fighters are avoiding him, this fight could make or break clottey|`|AA11884987	cotto wins easy by points ud.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	the thing about Clottey is that NOBODY knows who he is! only hardcore fans know him. And Cotto right now seems to be at that level where he is looking for opponents who will either make him look good or attract large crowds because of the name they bring to the table. I am not saying its the right or wrong thing to do but everyone seems to do that after a while. <br>  Look at Mayweather! His last 4 fights where against "name" opponents who either made him look good or brought a "name" to the table.|`|LSg84ucPaa	I wonder man, it would be a really good and close fight i must say, as for the Margarito issue why cnt people leave this alone now, guy got suspended end of thing

Y31Ci8vlaa	I think Roger federer will be breaking the record of pete sampras very easily and he will get it first.Rafael nadal will be able to cross the record of bjorn borg but it will take more time than that of Roger federer record.|`|d9hzMrzwaa	i personaly like rafael nadal better because he's super hot but i think roger feder will be the first to break it|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	nadal would be first|`|s359lZj4aa	I would probably say that Federer might break Sampras' record first. Although he'll have to work hard because Nadal beat him in 3 different courts now, so it'll be hard for him. Nadal will break Bork's record but it will take him a while, but he's been winning French opens since he was 18!|`|DuGanGcNaa	Nadal needs 1 more to break Borg's record and the next Grand Slam is his speciality - The French Open. I would guess Nadal (easily).|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Rafael Nadal will break Borgs record of 6 French Open titles :D !!|`|3NvSUXmqaa	I think both are inevitable and are bound to happen one day or another. I feel Federer is much closer to his mark since he only has to win 1 slam to equal the record and 2 to break the record. So technically speaking Federer can break the record before the end of this year. Nadal has to win 3 more French Opens to break Borg's record of 6 French so he has to wait for 3 more years.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i do not know about that but i know rafa if God keep him healthy and strong till 30 years old he will win nearly 8-9 French  open and he will break sampras and federer records!<br>  he will also be in top 10 with maradona phelps jordan  Fedor  shumaher  valentino rossi- babe ruth lance armstrong sergi Bumbka, athlete from all sports worldwide, of all time!|`|714cba240d17420c308fc51bd5b0160caa	Fed is on the decline right now and its gonna take some time for him to get back on top as long as Rafa is there. I think Rafa will break the french open record first.|`|A1ohtlWsaa	Federer first then Nadal|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	nadal will probably break borgs record 1st|`|KReWaGFsaa	Nadal will break Borg's record FIRST.

4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	The batsmen are offered bad light for their own safety, if they can't see the ball they have a good chance of getting out or hurt.  The umpires on the other hand want to see a result so will offer the light to the batsmen and let them decide if they want to go on, as they are the ones most in danger of getting hurt (if the batsmen are chasing 10 runs with wickets left they probably wont want to but if they are 150 behind with only 1 wicket left like in the west indies they had no hesitation in coming off).  The other thing that may happen if it gets a little gloomy is the umpires will tell the fielding captain that they can't bowl fast bowlers so that means the game can continue with less risk of injury to the batsmen.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Since it is dangerous for the batsman to face bowlers at such fast speeds in poor light(that is why opposition captains bring on the slower bowlers when they feel the umpires gonna offer the light)<br>  u cannot call of a test match jus for bad light on 1day. The batting team is offered the light because they need to be able to see the ball clearly and if the light is poor, that wont happen.. Fielding teams can also complain about poor visibility|`|arjadO5daa	They are the main part really, if the Batsmen can see the ball, then so could the fielders. If the batsmen cant see the ball, they will get hit, god knows where. It could injure a player, especially with a pace bowler coming around 85 mph. It may even be career threatening if they get hit, like in the chest, head.<br>  <br>  It is mainly just for the batsmen's safety, so it wouldn't hurt them/<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	The batsmen need to see the ball.  If you are batting and it is getting dark, the batsmen can appeal for bad light.  Yes, umpires can call off the match if it gets too dark.|`|AA11088802	cause they have to face the bowling|`|f9hiPMDxaa	It is mainly for the safety of the batsman. If the umpires feel it is too dark to safely play (use of light metre) they can stop play until the light gets better or call stumps.<br>  <br>  Keeper 95, the fielding side could have asked for the light in the old days. A famous case was in SA when Stan McCabe was carving up the SA attack and due to fading light the SA captain asked anout the light for the safety of his fielders.

5MtNumoSaa	Having gotten to know Harry a little bit through a charitable organization that he generously supported, I must correct a couple of misunderstandings about him that you have. <br>  First of all, Harry did not leave the White Sox because he thought baseball should be free. IN his autobiography "Holy Cow", Harry talked about this, and while he wasn't crazy about the idea of pay-TV (which is different from cable- it involved a scrambled signal with people paying basically to rent a descrambling box, and involved only one channel, not hundreds of them), his real concern was not the idea of being on a paid service, but instead was the fact that they had only sold about 40,000 subscriptions. He actually once told me that, if there had been a million or so subscribers, he would have stayed. While Harry did always feel the game was for the fans, his moving to the North Side was precipitated more by his concern that he would disappear from view if he stayed with the Sox. And to be honest, as much as Harry seemed to be a Chicago fan, his true baseball love was still the Cardinals, his hometown team.<br>  As to why so many Cubs fans think they "own" him, I think it is more because of the level his career went to with the Cubs. Remember, WGN became a superstation not long after Harry started with the Cubs, and that is when he went from being a very well liked local broadcaster to a national figure who reached almost legendary status. I am lucky enough to have heard him with the Cardinals, (my parents are originally from Central Illinois, and I spent many summer nights listening to Cardinals games with my father and grandfather while visiting that area) White Sox and the Cubs. Those of us who had that privilege (even Cubs fans like myself) appreciate Harry's career for his entire body of work.<br>  I would liken it to fans associating a particular player with one particular team. reggie Jackson, for example, played 9 years with the A's, and 6 with the Angels, but most fans (myself included) think of him as a Yankee (5 seasons) simply because that was when he was the most visible. Likewise, I will always tend to think of Carlton Fisk as a member of the Red Sox, despite the fact that he played more  seasons for the White Sox.<br>  I don't think anyone associating Harry more with the Cubs then with any of the other 3 teams he did games for (don't forget- he did A's games for one season between his time with the Cards and the Sox) is necessarily a matter of refusing to acknowledge his time with those other teams, but simply a matter of his time with the Cubs being the time in which he was more visible.<br>  <br>  Thank you for remembering him so fondly.<br>  <br>  From a life long die hard Cubs fan who loved Harry even before he came up to the North Side.|`|IqRtCFcZaa	Harry FINISHED WITH THE CUBS.... Cubs for 15 years i believe is exactly what you just stated.. Guess what he was also an annoucer for the cardinals.. it all depends on who is loyal to YOU... and in that fact the CUBS were loyal to Harry, NOT the WHITESOX, and not the CARDINALS, he finished with the cubs because the cubs wanted him, and he loved the cubs. Dumb *** socks fans just keep looking for new ways to cut down the cubs.|`|kHYRznVBaa	I'm a Giants fan and I think they do..  Why not???  That's like saying Willie Mcovey isn't a Giant just because he played a few years in San Diego,,or Joe Montana isn't a Niner just because he ended it in K.C...<br>  You think Harry; you think of the Cubs!|`|XeNGmDHvaa	when u think of him if u dont think of him with the cubs your crazy not many people no who was till the cubs|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I don't care who he announced for he was the reason the mute button was put on TV's.  I do have to say that White Sox fans are easier to be around than Cub fans.|`|sVPjp3dUaa	Everyone knows what Harry meant to Chicago. Unfortunately, seems like only the Cubs fans are willing to pay tribute to him & talk about him with respect. OK, he did start the 7th inning stretch with the Sox, but it obviously didn't become popular until he went to the Cubs. He may have been loved by fans of both teams, but I have never heard any Sox fan of any age say anything about him other than 'he was a drunk broadcaster'. Sounds to me like loyalties run thin on Shields & 35th.
nxymxSUFaa	Honestly no.  I have no interest in the eventual outcome of the tournament.  It's just another money making machine.  As limited as the schedule is, it really doesn't have that "team feel" to it.  It's just a bunch of all stars getting together for publicity and a big pay day.<br>  <br>  My mindset is on the upcoming major league season.  That is the true test of a team endurance.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Not really, I just want to see my mets play again. Letrs face it anyway the U.S team sucks. Purto rico or Dominican will win.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	Not really.  America is a melting pot of cultures.  Baseball is the ONE game that breaks down all barriers.  It doesn't matter where you come from or what you nationality is, we can all play together.  You find superstars from all over the globe playing in Major League Baseball.  Grant it, most are now citizens of America or here on work visa, they are here.  A lot of teams won't let their players play, or at least prefer that they don't, which dilutes the talent pool.  Add the lack of practice time and experience together and it's basically a scrimmage. <br>  <br>  The WBC is a novelty.  It's like an all-star game.  It's fun to watch.  And they can be as serious as they want to be about it.  It just isn't that important.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	No, because the timing of it is terrible.   Most US fans are focused on spring training and if they're going to watch baseball, it's going to be their own team's exhibition games.   The only good thing about it is that you get to see more prospects get spring playing time because some of the regular players are gone to play in the WBC.<br>  <br>  Now maybe if they held this thing in November, American fans would care.|`|RLoilwCNaa	No. Baseball is the 3rd largest sport here now behind the NFL and the NBA. Even college football is bigger. Steriods have killed baseball along with ridiculous salaries.|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	Its a waste of time just talking about. Get a better question.|`|34FXLLAHaa	Not really. The WBC is still a new event and not all players participate in the event because it could cause a player injury at the start of the MLB season. Some players choose to sit out the WBC out of caution for their MLB contracts.|`|AA10252869	No not really I am afraid some of the good players will get hurt|`|huAm27beaa	Yea its some good preseason ball and its good to see players rep their country

QC2NozBkaa	There actually was a steam cannon used during the Spanish American War.  I don't recall the specifics of the design but it held the steam externally and released it to launch sticks of dynamite.  It was not successful.  <br>  I don't see any way to heat the water fast enough to be practical.  And, if you could find a way to flash the water to steam, there are so many variables (elevation, atmosphereic pressure, etc.,) that inconsistant pressure release would make it inaccurate.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	The primer wouldn't be enough to vaporize, boil, or even warm the water much.<br>  <br>  Read up on conservation of energy.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	No.|`|LWxmRKnnaa	I don't think you would want steam in your barrel.|`|dpSr0icwaa	it does not sound feasable nor interesting.<br>  <br>  No way would the primer be able to put out enough heat to boil the water.  Even after boiling you'd have to super-heat it even further to get anything close to the pressures generated by the gunpowder burning.<br>  <br>  I do recall one set of novels where some college kids playing DnD got sent to a fantasy world by accident.  It was basically like the cartoon from the 80's DnD, except these guys kept their modern values.  This means they decided to fight the institution of slavery which was very common in middle age societies, including this one particular fantasy culture.  A few of the students were engineering and/or chemistry majors, and they developed gunpowder and flintlock type firearms.<br>  <br>  The 'real magic' wizards etc countered this by creating steam and then transmuting it to a powder, then once the process was reversed, it acted like the gunpowder propellant.<br>  <br>  Of course, you need magic to make this work.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Sorry, Bud. That theory just don't make the mark. The primer would have to be something seriously hot, but then you have corrosion problems, extra weight, blah, blah, blah.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	A primer produces very little heat (think a spark). This spark would usually ignite the powder and cause the bullet to be propelled out of the barrel. In your situation the spark would be extinguished by the water. If it were possible to use only water we would already be doing it because water is so cheap and readily available.
RjQLB9s1aa	I know a number of people who have happily bought rackets on ebay, so I think that would be a great option. This racket is only worth $65 brand new, (from tennis warehouse) so if you got $50 for it you would be doing really, really well. Somehow, I think that you would probably expect to get $30 - $40. <br>  I would suggest putting it on ebay with a set reserve, or start it at the minimum price that you would accept. Best of luck with selling it.|`|s8SSpUpjaa	people really do not buy raquets on ebay or directly from a person. I would say sell it to a friend. but buy a Wilson best raquets for a cosistinte player
fS8joiTaaa	Well to do the spine you dont want to start off with a big 6ft spine you will want to try a small 3 or 4ft one. So basically what you want to do is approach the ramp with moderate speed unless you want to go super fast and die or go to slow and fall over sideways lol. Then you want to pull up at the top of the spine and jump out into the other side. You might want to have some experience with jumping onto the decks of quarters. Then once your in the air and you are a little over the coping you will want to push the front end down and tuck the back tire up to your butt so you dont hang up on the lip of the spine. It also helps to go up at an angle and  sort of moto whip it a bit for a little more clearance.<br>  <br>  If you dont have much experience though i would take it slow and just try to land a little towards the bottom of the spine. So basically dont try and just air it super high and stylish just work your way up then you will be doin 180's over it in no time.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped. Best answer please :)

bTNxl0ohaa	I think its an excellent idea, though restrictions would have to be placed, and it would have to follow transfer windows etc, so players arent swapped in and out of the team.<br>  <br>  I think an under-23 team in the lower divisions is a good idea, with an allowance to play a couple of older guys per game.  <br>  <br>  Should the team need games to get first team guys match fit, they can do what Rangers did this year in the reserves winter break - organise friendlies.<br>  <br>  Id be interested to see how it works in spain and italy as im sure there are a few teams who do this already.|`|PChsC9traa	The fourth division would be to high for them|`|nH4TOhGVaa	Yes would be a good idea|`|S0LSmJ9haa	it's a good idea, need to write in there that we are allowed to swap the teams when we are playing pish, as our reserves are amazing right now and our first team are my arce|`|bzwSCm6taa	ha with the way our 1st teams are playing maybe they should be in the 3rd and let the reserves have a go...couldn't be much worse..
sGrrbz1aaa	i had the twins winning the al central before they signed Crede...they are taylor made for the metrodome...the Indians will be a team for the twins to watch out for...good luck to the twins...from a big reds fan|`|2ISGwSK7aa	I live in MN....and I like this deal for the Twins. They got a steal lets face it $2.5M base salary with incentives up to $7M. This deal has the opportunity to have great rewards for a small risk. There are PROBLEMS though. Back problems. A back isn't something that just gets better. Its a lifelong issue. IF the Joe Crede of old can show up, get his at-bats, and make his incentives, I think the Twins could lock up the Central. That is, if the Tigers continue to underachieve.|`|ak5A435maa	good for Joe and Twins i guess, yes it does make their infield a lot better and im going Twins for the AL Central.|`|0XTSsephaa	No.<br>  <br>  I love Joe Crede, but his back is all shot to hell.

bRrWuAqhaa	I agree.  Once a player doesn't want to play with a team anymore, it's best to let him go.  It was a good business decision and best for McCants personally.
ocHNtbQZaa	The reason you slow down at 60 yards is because you are not strong enough to support your body weight at ground contact. It's like trying to bounce a flat basketball. The fastest runners have the shortest ground contact times because they don't collapse at the ankle/knee. To get stronger do  'negative only' squats. Negatives are where you just lower the weight. Get in a squat rack and standing on the balls of your feet, lower the weight by squating down to the support pins to where your upper legs are parallel to the floor. If you don't have spotters, unload the weights and put back to start position and repeat. Hold enough weight so you can only do about 8 reps. You will be very sore until you get used to these in about a week. Only do 1 or 2 workouts per week. <br>  <br>  Run under distance top speed sprints (30-yards) to practice running as relaxed as possible.|`|AA10451072	High weight low rep is how every runner / athlete should do it, you're not looking to gain mass, you're looking to tone your muscle.<br>  <br>  Do 3 sets of 20 at around 1/2-2/3 your max.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wall sits would be an at home alternative.<br>  <br>  <br>  But overall, yes, low weight squats will help your 40 yd time.

gM0pk41jaa	I have the exact same problem. I can jump high as hell off two feet and dunk easily especially when i squat down first, but when jumping off one leg...i can barely just grab rim and im 6'2''. I think it has something to do flanging the opposite leg you jump off of in the air to propel you up more but its very hard tho when your not used to it. Id say the best bet is to practice dunking on lower rims off one leg and get the feel and gradually move up to 10 feet. Also work on explosiveness in your hips/shoulders etc|`|APqwrrpDaa	just jump rope it puts in amazing results

8qZrlz07aa	Your seating position could be the problem. <br>  <br>  If the nose of your saddle is positioned too far forward (pointing down), you can be putting too much pressure on your handlebar causing the pressure you are feeling in your hands.<br>  <br>  Check the position of your saddle with a level.  It should be basically level as a starting position and you adjust it very small amounts up or down from there (that means the nose of the saddle moving up or down).<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is the angle of your handlebar stem and the height of your steerer tube.<br>  <br>  Best to take your bike to the local bike shop and have it properly fitted to you.  The correct fit can make such a big difference you really can't believe it.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It could be several things.  The bike may to too big causing you to lean forward too much.  The saddle may be tilted down too much in the front causing you to push back with your wrists to stay in the saddle.

axxQzOCHaa	Welcome aboard. What took you so long ?|`|AYiVipawaa	You're actually making a good decision in liking the Red Sox. Yankees are only good because they're NY so they automatically get money.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	no problem  with that. you realized how class-less they are|`|frDcAqyWaa	no, no, yr not a bad person, you just see things clearly, that's good... you cannot be a real man if you are a Yankee fan, that's what I've always said. Yr growing up and making adult choices. <br>  <br>  NYC is nice... I lived in Upstate NY for a bit, but I'm from south of Boston originally, lemme tell yah, yr friends are gonna give yah hell fr switchin' ... heck they gave me hell after 04 fr bandwagoning and I was always a Red Sox fan (one of only 3 in my town) so imagine what yr gonna hear from those bleacher creatures.|`|0XTSsephaa	I hate telling someone to be a Yankees fan, but part of being a fan is being there in the crappy times as well as the good.  And anyways, the Red Sox ain't much better in my book.<br>  <br>  I bet you if the 103 came out, quite a few Red Sox would be on it.|`|NQBtZkeoaa	Do you drill holes in the heads of small woodlands creatures? If the answer is no you are not a bad person for liking a baseball team.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Your not a bad person. But I hate to let an Ex Yankee fan on the Bandwagon. NO turning back now.<br>  <br>  I'll let it slide if you get a "Yankees SUCK" t shirt.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	You'll be back, I guarantee it.   There is no escaping the dark side.|`|wm57tePUaa	its not that bad u could not be any more of a bad person|`|ICzMIML6aa	Honestly, all sports allegiances come down to is the amount of relate-able traits that can be attached between the team and the fan. The easiest comparison would be the Yankees "Evil Empire" vs. The Red Sox "Scrappy factory worker" perception. But lets be honest, that's a fallacy given the recent contract signings etc. The truth is perception is reality. Any team can seem like a good guy, just like any team can be a bad guy. As I'm mildly a redsox fan, I hated the devil rays. Someone who enjoys the sport may see the redsox as the true "Evil Empire"<br>  <br>  It comes down to this, if a team represents itself in a manner in which you do not support, then you have no responsibility to stick by that team. If you now relate the NYY for the things that are happening: Contract, Thongs, A"Roid", and the Steinbrenners, maybe it's time for a new team? <br>  <br>  On the flip side, if you enjoy the history: The Dimaggio, NY Stadium, the Torre era, the Jeter, etc. Then as the previous guy said you have to take the good with the bad. <br>  <br>  All in all, where you choose to place your allegiance or spend your money is entirely up to you. All of the "Good guy bad guy" stuff is in place to sell tickets by splitting two of the largest fan bases by unique parallels. There are no good guys or bad guys... There are Yankees and Redsox... Two teams (just like all the others) trying to do the same exact thing, WIN.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Wth is ur question? <br>  uhh no ur not a bad person|`|k5zvA1X9aa	Fair-weather/bandwagon. I'm sure the Yankee FAITHFUL don't mind losing you as a fan. Right now it's "cooler" to like Boston teams anyway. Just remember not to get rid of your Yankee hats/jerseys/etc because I'm sure you'll jump back on the bandwagon as soon as they win another World Series. <br>     <br>  P.S. I'm a Royals fan. So I'm not someone from NY hating on you. Stick with your team.

As for the kids, just keep them interested... what I've found is that as long as they're included, that's all they care about... catch a fish, and it's just a bonus, and I doubt the foremost thing in their mind is catching lunkers just yet.

pGlWlzj4aa	Here's what worked for me...<br>  <br>  You NEED a good spotter.  Find a buddy to workout with that has similar goals as you and is (preferably but not necessarily) similar to you in size.  Someone who has similar goals will help motivate you.  Someone of similar size won’t intimidate your or make you feel embarrassed because they’re so much stronger than you are.  It also helps make the workouts go faster because you won't be switching out tons of plates every set.  <br>  <br>  A good spotter will also recognize when you're struggling and assist you in lifting the bar, not yanking it out of your hands.  That's extremely important.  Both myself and my workout partner would get so upset when the other couldn’t make it to the gym on a chest day because we hated using someone new.  We knew how to read each other and how much to help one another and that’s what’s important.<br>  <br>  Many people like using sets with certain numbers of reps (i.e. 3 sets of 8, 10, or 12) but that doesn't work the best for me.  I worked out with a buddy like that for a couple of months.  I got bigger but not much stronger.  <br>  <br>  For strength building I use a 4-5 set system.  Usually 10 reps for the first 2 sets and then 5-7 for the third and 3-5 for the fourth, and 1 or 2 for the fifth.  That’s all you should be able to do anyway.<br>  <br>  I generally start with 10 reps of a weight that I am able with minimal effort to warm up with.  If your max is 143 then I would probably warm up with 100.  <br>  <br>  WIth each successive set go up 5 - 20 pounds, depending on how much you're struggling.  Do 10 reps or as many as you can do up to that.  If you can easily do more, then you're not lifting enough.  If you're struggling, have your spotter use a couple of fingers under the bar to help it up.  You're still pushing most of the weight, but he/she is just taking a couple of pounds up to allow you to do so.  <br>  <br>  By the fifth set (if you make it there) you should be just about exhausted.  Do 1 or 2 reps of a weight somewhere between 5-10 pounds heavier than your fourth set.  That’s all you should be able to do because your arms should be on fire by then.  Have your spotter help you if needed.<br>  <br>  Here’s what gets you stronger - even if you know you can't lift the weight anymore by yourself without help, do at least 1 or 2 reps with assistance.  Remember, your spotter is assisting you, not lifting most of the weight for you.  Make SURE your spotter is strong enough though.  If your spotter isn't strong enough, find a bigger guy for that one set.  It is not worth getting your ribs cracked.<br>  <br>  Other Tips: <br>  Don't do the same muscle group workouts back to back, make sure you have at least one day of rest in between to allow your muscles to heal and rest.  It will actually slow your progress if you overwork your muscles.  My favorite is a 3 group system similar to this:<br>  Day 1, 4: Chest, triceps, abs<br>  Day 2, 5 Biceps, shoulders, back, abs<br>  Day 3, 6: Legs, run, abs<br>  Day 7: Rest<br>  <br>  Also make sure to work large muscles before smaller ones.  If you smoke your triceps and biceps and then try to do bench press you’re not going to be able to lift anywhere near the weight that you would if you started with your chest.<br>  <br>  By using this method I was able to go from about a 105 pound max to a 175 pound max in a few months.  The thing is, I'm a female.  I actually slowed myself down because I was getting to look like Zena - Warrior Princess.  That was not my goal. :)   My (male) workout partner went from about a 140 pound max to over 225 in less than 6 months using the same system.  We're not pros, we just did what worked for us.  I hope that this helps you.<br>  <br>  Dreu|`|cypNCoh3aa	Learn to kick.|`|AA11601225	I can't beat the first answer|`|0b8887cb1bb770f83c9043e623f4cffcaa	if ur a junior, i agree with the other guy...which i hope ur not|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	As my high school coach use to say, "Do you have weights at home?...eat um'."|`|a1c85fb2fa8cb46f89a4425fb3921555aa	if you are a freshman...spend your summer in the gym..if you are a junior, take up cross country...

As far as Griffin and Blair, they'd both get theirs but Pitt would win in the end. Sam Young for Pitt would be the difference maker.|`|i5MInqeMaa	I hope that's the match.  I would love to see that.

I really hope we get to see them play.<br>  <br>  But to whomever said Pitt is an average team with Blair in foul trouble should rethink that statement.  They lead the big east in three point % (Blair hasn't attempted one obviously), Sam Young is one of the best swingmen in the big east, and Levance fields leads the nation in both assists to turnover ratio and assists per game.  So check yourself, FOOL!|`|WF1vAFpoaa	I would just hope the refs let 'em play!
XLXncQu9aa	I think they need to focus on their defense.  That has been a major issue with them the past few years.  Their offense is above average and can score points but the issue is they need to be consistent.  The worst thing they could have done was release Deuce McAlister.  Even though he was injured the past few years he could still produce. Not having him will hurt them next year if they don't get consistent on offense.  Reggie Bush is a bust so far in his career so they really can't rely on him.  I think they need to draft another WR, and get their defense beefed up.  Drafting another LB or a player in the secondary would be helpful. If they can get their defense on track they will be better.  I predict them to be 10-6 next year.  They had some tough games that they won this past season.  The only problem is their defense allowed too many points and their opponents racked up too many yards.  I say draft defensively and try to fill the void in at RB.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	They will play 16 regular season football games.

We lost about 5 games by 4 points or less, and two of them should have been one but our terrible kicker missed two game winning kicks. But we have a new kicker, 13-13, and we will get Vilma back, We got LB Dan Morgan, and I'm hearing rumors that Safety Darren Sharper is going to be a Saint. If Malcolm Jenkins falls to 14th, and theres a chance of that because Green Bay is the only one before us that really needs a corner, but sense their switching to 3-4 they will need a Nose Tackle like BJ Raji more, then we will have two great great corners with him and Tracy Porter, and an average one with Randall Gay. If we get all this squared away look for the saints to make a big splash next season

AA11337952	Teacher's will have further incentive to do a better job in the classroom.<br>  <br>  Teacher's work a lot harder than hockey player's do, because teaching people is pretty hard work. They have to devote a lot of off-the-clock time to grading and helping students and such, not to mention teacher's still have lives outside of school to maintain.<br>  <br>  Teachers are what help raise up the next generation. They watch-over, nurture, and educate children almost (and sometimes more) than parents do. Everybody can use a teacher, not everyone can use a hockey player.|`|IgxJRGpkaa	Obviously you don't know how much time and commitment nhl players have put in to better themselves at what they do<br>  <br>  Most nhl players have been practicing and playing hockey since age four.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most teachers have been training for teaching since 18<br>  <br>  Along with practicing hockey players need to get in their best physical condition and have to invest alot of money into hockey. <br>  <br>  Sure hockey may be just a game, but it has drawn many nations together watching something they love<br>  <br>  <br>  Although teachers should be paid more money, hockey requires way more talent and work. Hockey players deserve way more than teachers.|`|QKc5VFK5aa	It is tough to compare the two.  If you are trying to justify teachers earning more than hockey players, you need to realize that even though hockey is one of the "lowest" paying professional sports the minimum paid hockey player still earns half a million dollars.  This would mean that teachers would then need to earn more than half a million and there is no way that the money is available to do that.  <br>  <br>  Teachers certainly should make more money then they currently earn, but there isn't enough funding to go around.  There would be a lot more people wanting to become teachers.  Teachers are great role models and offer students guidance that they can use for the rest of their lives.  If the money is there then teachers should earn more.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	everyone is acting like hockey is an easy thing. Do you know how hard it is to even be in the NHL? They work their butt's off all year long. Teachers just hand out worksheets and book work and they also get the summers off. Some teachers make kids life a living hell. How's that for a good role model? They are getting a little more than what they deserve. It's a billion more times easier to be a teacher than a hockey player. And if anyone would like to disagree, lets check out the hockey workout room and on-ice practices, you wouldn't last a second.|`|UdoLcwm4aa	No reason.

KtJmEx1zaa	Get a local to help you, or you probably won't catch anything. It's a joke with the people watching tourists catch no fish.<br>  <br>  You need local bait. And many of the shore fish are vegetarians, so bread balls and corn or other types of bait works.<br>  <br>  Peers are good or sometimes places pleasure boats dock if allowed. If you can fish around fishing boat doc areas where they clean the fish and dispose of the parts it can be really good with some huge fish. If you want to shore fish find a place where beach meets rocks and no one is surfing or you could incur serious local wrath, and you don't want to do that. <br>  <br>  What can you catch? There are literally hundreds of species. There are places the deep water is only a few feet away from the shore, and during high tide anything could come in. Probably not Marlin or huge Tuna, but an amazing variety of species and sizes of fish including sharks.<br>  <br>  It's not easy fishing the shore because coral catches your line and if you get a fish on it's likely to cut it quickly. Better to get a higher perch where you can keep them out of it with pressure up.<br>  <br>  Going out in a little boat and getting a kid to go down and bust up some clams to attract a bunch of reef fish is a good way to get things going. You break open a clam and they come from all over and have a feeding frenzy which attracts larger fish. Now that's a secret I learned in Okinawa, and I know it works in Hawaii too because of friends who told me. I've been there in Hawaii, but never spent a lot of time fishing. <br>  <br>  Going out after the big game fish isn't worth it if you ask me. Very few come back with anything. The deep sea fishing for bottom fish is better if you go out, and much cheaper. Don't go screwing around in a little boat yourself either, so many people get swept out every year. There are currents which will have you out to sea before you know it, then you can't get back because of the current, and you are way out there and pretty lonely and it's a crap shoot if anyone gets out to help you. It's a damned big ocean out there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|252719641f8be9be749df917e256dd53aa	If you can find an area that permits it, try surf-fishing. That is an affordable, easy way to enjoy fishing. I am sure that using a bait such as shrimp you can catch some red drum or even salt-water cats. The great thing about salt-water fishing is that you never know what you might catch! LOL.
zih6UH0laa	actually get on it|`|TnCEBXIjaa	depends what your going for.. <br>  <br>  for example if its for fat burning, the pyramid techinique is best! this is where you go at a fast pace for 2 or so minutes.. then a steady pace for 3 minutes. then back to another 2 minutes of a fast pace. the 3 minutes will leave a good recovery time to get your breath back!<br>  Do this for about an hour or so. and you can vary your pyramid times!!
JXJQTgULaa	Okay, I may not be a boy cheerleader, but I did see that no one has answered your question. So first, you are definitely not too heavy to be a flyer. Remember, guys are VERY strong, especially cheer leading boys. You will do fine, if you know how to fly, and can do it well, it really doesn't matter how much you weigh (well, if you weighed 180 pounds or something, that may be different lol). If you are flexible and are able to pull something really good off, like a scorpion or something, you will do well. I think you should tryout, even if you don't make it, what are you going to lose? Besides, not everyone flys, and I bet you have really good tumbling skills and jumps. Go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck =D|`|d3B9MxYbaa	i am not a boy but you are not to heavy.

They are actually surfing above large underwater structures.  Actual open ocean swells don't typically break because there is no land for them to shoal on.  <br>  <br>  If the video looked like monstrous open ocean swell with no visible land it was probably Cortez.  Todos Santos is pretty far off shore also but is pretty easy to pick out because the wave has a large ledge in the middle of it while it is breaking.  If you saw Step Into Liquid there was a section shot at Cortez.|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Cortez Bank|`|YCRIHPJwaa	it is 100 miles of san diego in a place called cortez bank|`|hXbwXDMfaa	It's Probably 'Jaws' on the North shore Maui.

My 4-year degree is in History. I've only hired one employee in the past two years who had an Outdoor Rec/Forestry degree. Most of my guides were hired because of experience, not degrees. I have lots of friends with Outdoor Rec degrees, Parks Management degrees, Tourism degrees, etc. etc. For the most part, very few of them have a year-round gig. Many still work seasonal jobs year after year. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, a degree in Outdoor Recreation Management is almost worthless. You pay a lot for the degree and you usually get out of college still working an hourly wage seasonal gig with no bennies and no way to pay back the loans. Get a job with a guide service, outfitter, or something similar first. Then build your experience. Pick up certifications as you go. As you gain experience and certifications your value goes up. You can work as a seasonal guide or a park in the summer and then switch gears and teach skiing or mountaineering in the winter (or guide in the opposite hemisphere!) By the time you are 22 you have worked 4 years, picked up a bunch of certs (sometimes paid for by your employer) and you have no college loan to pay off. <br>  <br>  Park Rangers and Outdoor non-profit organizations usually like their people to have degrees.

8MUj24s6aa	If this is your first handgun and have no or little experience I would suggest a .22lr pistol. They are a low cost pistol that will allow you to learn the fundamentals of shooting handguns with a low recoil and low costing round.<br>  <br>  I suggest a Sig Sauer Mosquito, Smith and Wesson Model 22a, or a Ruger Mark III or 22/45 Mark III.<br>  <br>  If this guns primary job is home or self protection i would start off with a 9mm pistol. 9mm is a good round for defense and is on the lower side of price for ammo and recoil. A .22lr pistol will not work for defensive uses.<br>  <br>  Either way you go, make sure you attend a safety class and if you choose self defense take a defensive handgun course as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sigsauer.com/Products/ShowCatalogProduct.aspx?categoryid=30" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigsauer.com/Products/ShowCat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&langId=-1&pageSize=10&published=1&beginIndex=0&resultType=2&attributeName1=Model&attributeValue1=22A&attributeValueType1=STRING&attributeValueOperator1=EQUAL&isFirearm=Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php?version=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAFamily?type=Pistol&subtype=Centerfire%20Autoloading&famlst=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FASubType?type=&subtype=Rimfire" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...</a> Autoloading<br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/products/product-details.cfm?id=157&category=Pistol" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/products/produc...</a>|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	What would be the primary purpose? Pleasure shooting, home defense, concealed carry? What is your price range? Keep in mind, most autos these days only come with 1 magazine so you might figure in another 1-2 mags in your budget<br>  <br>  If a revolver, something in a .357 mag. Taurus and Rossi are very affordable. Smith is good but will cost twice as much.<br>  <br>  In autos, a 9mm or .40 is good. A .45 is a real stopper and great for defense but takes a little more practice to master. In autos, a 1911 model is a traditional model but is heavy and takes more practice to be comfortable enough with for self defense. Many companies make composite pistols that are light, easy to use and reliable. They can be a little more pricey but you usually get what you pay for. I have personally fired about everything under the sun. While not a personal fan of the Glocks (don't like the trigger pull or the lack of a positive safety), many love them including many police departments.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	As someone else mentioned, it depends on use. <br>  <br>  if you want something for protection in a CCW is going to be something that you'd carry in bear country or take to the range. <br>  <br>  Personally I like a couple of things. I love the Ruger Revolver line.. However for CCW revolvers, I like the taurus or S&W subcompacts. <br>  <br>  For semi-autos it depends on frequency of use, size of hand, (best fit).. <br>  <br>  I opted for Taurus MP Pro. with the multitude of autos, some people like the 1911 frame, others like Glock.. Best tact is to go to the range and check the rentals and try them out. Don't buy before you find a good fit.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Colt Combat Commander.*|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	Even though your question is for the "guys" lol.

For plinking or paper targets you can't beat a .22lr. A S&W .22A is a good inexpensive handgun. It has a 5.5" barrel and adjustable sights. The Ruger .22s are good too. For carry, look at the Glock or Springfield XDs or a revolver like the S&W 686 or Ruger GP100 with a 4"bbl.

The "best" handgun is different for everybody. I would recommend going to a range that rents guns and trying a few out. Go to a gun shop and ask for recommendations. There are so many possibilities that it's impossible to tell you what the "best" gun for you is. Also, please disregard any answers that say "this gun is the best". There is no one size fits all when it comes to guns.

IITnJjAjaa	Either your legs and not too big for your body and are supposed to be that size, or you're running too fast and are using the legs so much it's building up lots of muscle. For running, remember the slower you run, the more fat it burns. You are better off running than using equipments/weights as they are more likely to build up muscle wheras running (slow) just builds up lean muscle|`|mLtOEN9Qaa	By doing squats and lunges you are building up muscle in your legs.  As opposed to doing lunges and squats increase the length your run.  Doing this creates a "sleeker" physique.  By running longer, muscle is broken down, therefore decreasing mass.

nxymxSUFaa	There is absolutely no question that if we compare both careers, Derek Jeter is by far the better of the two.<br>  <br>  One need only take the time to review their career stats.  This question always leads to the defensive portion of Ozzie's career.  Although Ozzie had the great talent of making the average play look hard and the hard play look impossible, there are a number of shortstops who have comparable and even better defensive numbers than Smith.  Deter Jeter is one of those shortstops.<br>  <br>  As far as offensive stats, Ozzie couldn't hold a bat to Jeters numbers.<br>  <br>  Finally, Ozzie has one ring, Jeter has four!|`|L77OlY1naa	The Wizard by a long shot!!! What has Jeter done REALLY!!! The Yankees won Championships NOT Derek.He is a decent long term player.Ozzie played in a hard time where the ss was just a body.Now can U name me a better SS with range and hitting ability then Ozz NO u cant.Jeter is AVG at SS and Avg on the base pads.IM done talking Jeter is a poster BOY THE FACE A F*CKOOF n ORG|`|k5zvA1X9aa	The Wizard of Oz.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Going by the key word "overall" I would have to give the nod to Jeter.<br>  <br>  Ozzie only gets the nod on Defense - Ozzie was one of the best ever with the glove and was still above average when he retired.<br>  <br>  As a hitter, Ozzie was more of a liability on offense for more of his career than Jeter has become on defense in his.  Ozzie was known as a very good baserunner, but I don't think Jeter gets enough credit for his baserunning instincts.<br>  <br>  Jeter has been "big game" player throughout his career.  Ozzie was a great guy, but often overshadowed by his teammates from his early Padre days through the Willie McGee/Vince Coleman era.<br>  <br>  If I was putting together a team and had to pick one, I'd pick Jeter.  What I got back in "presence" would more than make up for Ozzie's advantage with the glove.|`|5xIroQjMaa	That's more of one of those club needs things. I would give Jeter the slight edge over Ozzie  based on intangibles, but it's so close that if I were a manager and had to choose, it would depend entirely on the rest of my lineup. If I had the bats, I would shore up the middle with Ozzie. And if I needed runs, I'd use Jeter. <br>  <br>  Of course if I wanted a defensive shortstop I'd go with Omar Vizquel over Ozzie Smith as it is. Ozzie might be the wizard, but Omar is the best of all time.|`|eDL3cnL4aa	Ozzie by far.  Jeter is a defensive liability at this stage.|`|wmYnJd2jaa	Offense: Jeter is in a completely different league than Ozzie<br>  Defense: Ozzie is in a completely different league than Jeter<br>  Intangibles: Jeter - leadership that is second to none, one of the all time great clutch players (although Ozzie was pretty good in the clutch, too). <br>  <br>  Overall, I'll take Jeter. I think the additional runs he creates on offense outweigh the runs that Ozzie's defense would save.|`|W7BZcdynaa	Jeter is way better offensive player. Ozzie was an awful offensive player. He was a career .260 hitter with no power. He is 9th all-time in Stolen bases, however.<br>  <br>  On the defensive side it's completely different, Jeter is an average defensive player at best don't let those Gold Gloves fool you. He finished dead last in zone rating for three years in a row (02,03, and 04) and second to last in '01. We all know how good Ozzie was with the glove.<br>  <br>  I'd take Jeter becuase of his offense.|`|2p4AqnUNaa	Ozzie Smith is the better defensive Shortstop but as a teammate and who i would want to be up to bat in the World Series i would say Derek Jeter. Ozzie Smith is the best defensive Infield of all time but overall i would say i would rather have Jeter at the plate.|`|AA11720887	Ozzie with the glove but Derek with the bat any day.

It is in fact Jeter who makes the average play look hard, because his range is just aweful. the only reason that he looks good is beacause he has to run and jump on plays that the average SS can make with his feet planted. and his arm is very inacurate, because he almost never sets his fet when he throws. Defense is the name at SS. The wizard gets the nod.|`|AA10183304	Ozzie.<br>  <br>  other than Cal Ripken, Jr....shortstop was not one of the overly HIGH offensive positions. It was more a defensive position. If you have more offensive production out of your corners and 2nd baseman, then there's nothing to worry about. Whatever ya got out of your shortstop, was all a plus.<br>  <br>  plus the fact, Ozzie was the pure professional. Jeter's just a cocky a**|`|ASeS1Jo8aa	Derek Jeter no dout. this guy makes the whole team better he is a born leader and everybody thats work with him loves him and he is really a people's person and most important gets you those amazing catchest and hit when the team really needs them!!|`|T9vs3asQaa	Ozzie until Jeter can do a backflip

uwx7etCXaa	I have not tried this but let me give you a few ideas why it wouldn't work, not even for beginners.  It wouldn't work because not every shot is treated the same.  Any tennis player can tell you that your stroke will vary within the same game more than twice because your return is accommodated to whatever shot is returned at you.  You can expose beginner players to the bracket because they will get used to hitting the ball the same way all the time, and when they face someone with weak returns, they will be in trouble.  Why have them learn the game the wrong way and force them to relearn the game later?  It doesn't make sense.  The whole purpose of the learning experience is to learn from your opponent; this is the limits of the racket bracket, you only learn to hit the ball one way against every player; wrong technique!!|`|NR5LhOpPaa	They actually are effective for giving beginners the feel of what they are supposed to be doing.  Many beginners have a very wristy form at first, and this will help correct that.  <br>  <br>  But it's best used just so they get the feel. Then, they should play without it and try to mimic that feel on their own.<br>  <br>  However, some of the pros at the club I used to go to got hold of one and tried it out just for fun.  Some of them could deal with it, but for others, it actually kept them from being able to use their form.  This would imply that their form is, in fact, incorrect.  However, these are teaching pros with very solid form.  So, it's not a great tool for advancing/advanced players.

444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	capoeira is a great deal of fun.  I've never encountered any other martial art that had the element of fun so embedded in it's core philosophy.  the entire idea of capoeira is the idea of play.  You play the game in the roda and try to outdo each other in your skill of the game.  capoeira teaches a bit of everything: martial art, dance, acrobatics, music and many more things.  Many of the people that bad mouth the art have obviously never trained in a class.  the acrobatics and dance routines you learn are an ideal tool to build up strength in those areas that you'll need most during a real fight.  plus your sense of rhythm is greatly trained by working to the music.  Capoeira has been used as an effective system of self defense and even during many of the wars that Brazil fought with their neighbours and by the slaves themselves during their struggle for liberation.  Even today many people envolved in Capoeira take part in vale tudo competitions  with great succes.  you will learn self defense but mostly in an unconventional way<br>  but above all you will have a lot of fun doing it.  just take a class and be hooked for life|`|UHTcpdkVaa	I've only been playing for about a month (and yes you do play it, contrary to the other poster) and I enjoy it tremendously.  Prior to finally signing up for a class, I took a few weeks to try out a number of different groups and think that I received a good feel for what Capoeira is in my area, and how the different groups differ.<br>  <br>  To make it simple, the group that I signed up with was fun.  The groups that I did not sign up with, were not fun.  All were an amazing workout that I doubt that many could make it through (I'm still trying to make it through a full beginner's class myself).  The one I chose had a great deal of variety in the format of the class - others were more structured and less varied from class to class.<br>  <br>  Sure, 30 minutes of stretching are important, but one did it all at once, and the other did it for 5 minutes at a time and then did something else for awhile.  This kept my muscles warm and limber, and give me a chance to work out the inevitable kinks.  In the other, I had to soldier on despite getting cramped - and I didn't like that.<br>  <br>  You asked about Capoeira in general though - and while I wanted to let you know that groups are different and worthy of trying out several - let me get to what I enjoy and don't enjoy.<br>  <br>  I greatly enjoy the workout.  I'm not the type to go to a gym and run for 45 minutes - and ever expect to return.  If it's a sport, I can run for 45 minutes and love every second, but without a reason to run I just don't do it.  In class, I move my body at a running pace for at least that long, and never notice how god awful boring it is.  Since they mix that up with calisthenics (some of it brutally difficult), and acrobatics, you're not going to find a better, or more varied, body weight workout outside of gymnastics, or a crossfit gym.<br>  <br>  When I was 6 years old, my family was on a car trip.  During the trip I was looking out of the window and saw a guy walking on his hands - I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen and wanted to learn how to do it.  I thoroughly enjoy the various acrobatic moves that I'm learning - even though I still suck at them.  I am getting better though, and that's awesome.<br>  <br>  Finally, while I would probably never, ever use Capoeira in a street fight (at least without 5 years or so under my belt, and then only sparingly) I like martial arts.  Ask any taekwondo guy if they would ever actually use a jumping spinning double kick in a fight, and most would say probably not.  Then ask them if they are glad they learned it - I have a hard time believing that they would say no.  Sure, a crescent kick may not be a powerful kick - but taking a hook to the face and turning the momentum into a Meia Lua de Compasso is quite possible, and would be highly unexpected in the right situation.  Valdemar Santana used it to defeat Helio Gracie after all.<br>  <br>  The kicks are as diverse as those in Taekwondo, and when combined with the evasive movements could be quite useful.  As of yet, I do not have the experience to really use them, but I'm hopeful!<br>  <br>  Finally, the roda is a blast.  There is something about the roda that makes an hour or two of sweating out all of your fluids seem like something that happened a week ago when you get in the roda at the end.  There is a mental part to it that really lets your whole essence get into what is going on.  The unpredictably of what the others are going to do, and how they are going to play means that each time is a different experience that is always fun (for me!).<br>  <br>  What do I not like?  I don't like landing on my head, that hurts, but I'm getting better.  I don't like that I can't speak Portuguese, so I miss out on some of the jokes in class - but I'm learning.  I don't like that the class I chose is 45 minutes away - but I turned down the class that was right across the street so it's my fault.  I don't like how out of shape I am compared to the people that have been there for a year or more - but it also gives me something to aim for.  I guess the thing that I don't like the most, is that I don't get to do it more often. :-)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just noticed that you were a female - you might like to know that there a a lot of females that play Capoeira - and the reason that I started it was the smile that this one girl had in the roda.  I wanted to be that happy too!)|`|tQGRJBYAaa	You don't play it. It's more of a flashy thing that rarely works in modern MMA fights or even street fights. But it's not ineffective but compared to other styles, it's not good.|`|AA10069553	In all the fights/training I've seen it used, it has failed miserably (And no I have not seen only one fight either maybe 15 or 20). It's just too flashy and ineffective.
kWL0WDRnaa	The Italian Serie A is the top flight of Italian soccer. The UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League are the European club championships.  The top 4 teams from England, Spain, and Italy qualify for the champions league.  The number of qualifying teams varies from league to league, but teams from all over Europe participate.  The next best teams who do not qualify for the Champions League qualify for the UEFA Cup. The FA cup is an English tournament in which teams from all levels of English football compete. The Championship is the second flight of english football. Coca Cola Leagues 1 and 2 are the next levels.  The SPL is the Scottish Premiere League.  AC Milan finished 5th last year in Italy and so qualified for the UEFA Cup.|`|ojHN65J0aa	Champions League & Eufa Cup are between all the teams in europe that finished 3 or 4th(mostly). Its multi national, and involves teams from different leagues, in different countries placed 3 or 4th(mostly).<br>  <br>  Champions league is more prestigious, its between 1st & 2nd placed teams. AC Milan is in the Eufa Cup. <br>  <br>  FA Cup and Premier league are all English competitions. Only english teams compete in them. The FA cup is a tournament that involves teams from differing teirs of competition. <br>  <br>  Premier League is Englands most sought after trophy because its the highest tier of football. <br>  <br>  L1/L2/SPL - im not quite sure. Wikipedia should help. Im guessing they are differing levels of football in one country.

D9zB8suoaa	Well I jump very high, but mainly because of 2 things. 1- I love skateboarding. 2- I used to jump over large objects a lot. I guess find a hobby requiring jumping or exercise your legs, then practice gradually jumping over large objects, like a sofa, to a chair, etc, and bend those knees if your going to jump OVER something at least. Then, if you want to jump up, thats all about the combination of jumping over objects combined with just simply leg strength.|`|XbW3ItBsaa	i say up the weight that yo do on your legs and play alot of basketball with some friends thats what i did during the summer and it workeed

IITnJjAjaa	Train on the track for the Cross Country then. Surely training for cross country involves the track anyway? They both kinda tie in with each other. Tell them you're not quitting, you just wanna focus on cross country and that you wanna train less on the track and more on grass/hills/roads. Btw, track is a lot better for your legs than roads (i have medial tibial stress syndrome)<br>  <br>  I know how you feel, i took both French & German but i only liked German and only took the French because my parents and teachers wanted me to. After a while, they realised and everything was fine.<br>  <br>  I love cross country too, it's soo much more exciting in my opinion than running round in a circle. Still, i do like track!|`|G1ZgTqNcaa	If you really do not like it, then you should quit.  I am surprised you hate track, but love cross country.  What about track do you not like?  Is there something about it you can change that will make you like it?  Track will make you stronger for cross country.  However, if you are really unhappy and your grades are being affected, then you should quit.  Talk to your coach and dad about how you feel.  track is such a demanding sport that if you are not enjoying it, then you should not do it.|`|wdzL4cZZaa	if you get no joy out of it, quit. i took guitar for 2 1/2 years and i had only one more semester of it but i quit because it was no fun for me. <br>  <br>  can you answer my question?

KJWxqQHiaa	There's many baits to catch carp, worms, doughbait and corn being the most popular. But, my favorite bait would be a peanut butter/cinnamon doughball. Made of peanut butter, cinnamon, bread, crackers and maple syrup. It's an amazing bait. I cannot catch any carp at all, without peanut butter in the recipe.<br>  <br>  You can put it on a regular hook, or a treble hook and it seems not too hard to stay on the hook, because of the syrup. All i do is get some split-shots to wait the bait down to the bottom.<br>  I use a medium-heavy rod, with either 10 or 14 lb. test.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	Why would you want to catch carp? I'm from the US and over here we consider carp a "trash fish"|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Another one to try when carp fishing is use dough balls made with grape jelly or grape soda and use small treble hooks.<br>  Another one we used was dough balls made with strawberry jam or strawberry soda(if you can find it)<br>  .<br>  We always fished for carp in fast water right below the spill way when the water was coming over. <br>  <br>  Another thing we used to do was spear fish for them right below the spill when water was coming over. But you have use scuba gear and a tag line (safety line to pull yourself out with) instead of just skin diving because of the fast water.  Otherwise you will get in big trouble real fast.<br>  Had to go in a drag more than one guy that was skin diving out when they got in trouble.|`|LzfkWJzNaa	Best thing to do to catch carp is to chum with dog food. Then if you dont see any action chum with sum corn.  Once you do that than put a piece of bread on. I prefer Wonder bread it stays on the longest.  This would most likely be the best way to go.  Make sure you set up many poles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck Carp Fishing!|`|vv0v03SHaa	If you want some real fun try fly fishing for them. here are a couple of great articles on how to do it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.helium.com/knowledge/183354-how-to-fly-fish-for-carp" rel="nofollow">http://www.helium.com/knowledge/183354-h...</a>|`|fypEh5FWaa	corn is the good bait.|`|x1BE43hYaa	my neighbor takes chunks of dry dog food, drills a hole in each piece and puts it on a hook (through the hole).

A smart tactician picks whichever tactic works for each game.  You can't approach every game with the same mentality.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Agree with all of the above|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Agree....you are really good at defending your club :D|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Well for me as Barca fan just a win is not enough, if Pep was winning games but was playing like Milan he would be fired already, some fans doesn't care how their team wins, we Barca fans care, we want attractive attacking play....... Mourinho wanted to be Barca's coach and Laporta rejected him because of one reason, he plays unattractive football, there is no doubt that Mourinho would bring a lot of trophies to Barca but the fans would be unhappy with 1-0 wins and Italian style of game...... I would rather lose but fight and attack until last second than to win with defensive anti-football tactics!!!!

I think he should improve on the outside shots anyway...  If he can make those shots time and time again, he'll have the most complete game of all centers in the NBA.  Look at Tim Duncan and his game.  Though he is back to the basket 90% of the time, he'll still drain the three when you need him to.
zJC18FtAaa	Aaron Curry, Brian Orakpo, and Brian Cushing|`|ABoo1doVaa	Malcom Jenkins out of Ohio State is a can't miss. If he isn't fast enough to play corner, he will make a great safety. He is a great kid that works harder than anyone else. I think Pat White is pretty much a can't miss. The only question mark for him is injury. He had a great day throwing the ball at the combines, and is very athletic, so that if he doesn't work out as a QB, he can move positions. Stafford can be great, but he is still a year or two away imo. I like Moreno, but I am not sure he is a top 15 pick. Same with Maulaluga.(I have no idea if I spelled that right).|`|j5fNBBi9aa	Im lookin forward to seeing Darius Hayward-Bay....had an impressive Combine....could be really good.....also lookin at Crabtree (obviously), Hakeem Nicks, and for a RB even though he didnt do much at the combine im interested to see wat LeSean McCoy can do in the league... on the defensive side of the ball I really like this Aaron Curry kid....he could be really good....as far as some that I dont think are too promising....Matthew Stafford....he will come in with HUGE expectations especially with wat Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco did last year....but I think hes more like Jamarcus Russel then Ryan and Flacco.....|`|n4dnIrBlaa	Besides for Michael Crabtree, I think we should be talking about Pat White. He's pretty good, good arm with solid accuracy and decent accuracy down field as well. He can scramble and rush very well if he has to and he can hit the out routes too.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	r u serious harrell won't even get drafted he has looked like garbage ever since the end of they year i agree pat white has worked his way up best quarterback who threw at the combine yes better than freeman and sanchez he can make it playing quarterback|`|U3KAgO0baa	Graham Harrell- QB Texas Tech<br>  Great accuracy and a good enough arm 2 be  solid starting pro QB...|`|BEgSXcZaaa	I see Rhett Bomar as a sleeper.

NXktxy8jaa	Great Question :-)<br>  <br>  The Superstar that has impressed me within the past few months has to be Randy Orton. Since the start of 2009, Randy Orton has drawn a lot of heat and that started when he Kicked The Chairman, Vince Mcmahon. That gave him so much attention especially leading up to The Royal Rumble Match. At The Royal Rumble, he managed to win the Rumble Match, and that Guaranteed him a Main Event Title Match at Wrestlemania 25 and it seems like he is going for Triple H and the WWE Title. After The Royal Rumble PPV, Shane Mcmahon got in a recent feud with Orton that led up to No Way Out, where they faced off in a No Holds Barred Match. Orton won the match, but the next night on RAW, Shane challenged Orton to an Unsanctioned Fight. Once again Randy Orton won and he kicked Shane's head as well. Then Stephanie Mcmahon came out to see if Shane was ok only to get RKO'ed by Orton. Finally Triple H Rushed to the scene to help his Wife as Orton ran off. This drew a lot of Heat towards Orton, and now a possible Triple H and Randy Orton could be seen at 'Mania.<br>  <br>  The Diva that impressed me these past few months was Melina. I never thought that she would get a Title Run at all, especially this long. The Divas Title Run's are usually short, but this one I think will extend over a decent period of time, maybe through The PPV Backlash or Judgment Day. She has a good feud againt Beth Phoenix going and they can;t just drop it now. Also with Rosa Mendez joining the feud, who knows, maybe she will be The Next Womans Champion?<br>  <br>  The Superstar that Im very Disapointed with is JBL. He is one of my favorites and he deserves a Major Push but the WWE fails to give it to him. His recent Storyline with Shawn Michaels was Pointless, and I don't think anyone cared about it. There was no point to it, and it was obvious to what was going to happen. JBL should have at least gone for the Intercontinental Title.<br>  <br>  The Diva that Im disapointed with is Mickie James. She was one of the most popular Divas last year and now the WWE fails to give her a push. She rarely appears on RAW anymore and if she does, its only for a quick scene. I think she should change brands to Smackdown and up the Diva's Division over there.<br>  <br>  The Superstar that Deserves a Major Push is Shelton Benjamin as well. I think he is going to be the Future Of The Business and he does deserve a big win. At least let him win the Money In The Bank Ladder Match or maybe even give him a Major Title, even if it is just for a few weeks. He has the talent that a Main Eventer needs but currently the WWE Fails to see that. As for a Diva I would have to go with Maryse as well. Like you said, she is The Divas Champion, but she rarely appears and she is losing Popularity fast. She needs to put her Title on the line more often and get more TV Time.<br>  <br>  A superstar who should take some time off the spotlight would have to be John Cena. Everyone is tired of seeing him as The Champion for no reason and it is time for others to have the Belt. Perhaps Kane or JBL?<br>  There is currently no Diva who should step down, the Divas need all the Pushes They can get.<br>  <br>  Like you said, Finlay winning the ECW Title. They guy is 50 years old and his only title that he won in the WWE was the U.S. Title. Jack Swagger is a good champion, but he got the title way too early. Finlay deserves to win the ECW Title even for just a month or two.<br>  <br>  Rivalry would be Chris Jericho Vs. Edge. I Know it already happened but it was in 2005 and both of their attitudes and In-Ring Performances have changed.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Most impressive<br>  Matt Hardy - The heel turn he had was very impressive<br>  Eve - Quite a debut in my opinion. She isn't a great wrestler but one night on TV and she surpasses Kelly and Maria combined. <br>  <br>  Disappointed <br>  Big Show - I just am not happy with his performances lately, he isn't doing very well in my opinion....<br>  Maria and Kelly continue to disappoint along with Candice who hasn't shown any reason to why she had the title before since returning but I'm disappointed mostly with what the WWE did to Natalya and Katie Lea, they first made them jobbers and then transferred them to a show with no title on it. <br>  <br>  Push<br>  Chavo Guerrero - Make him the winner of this triple threat feud for the US title, this guy is a great wrestler with plenty of charisma. <br>  Katie Lea and Natalya for their amazing wrestling ability that got made into managers into a no diva title show.<br>  <br>  Timeout from the limelight <br>  I personally think that the superstars are all in good position right now. The Triple H - Orton feud could really signify a passing of the torch while Edge's title fits his character and storyline as well as pulling John Cena away from RAW's main event allowing for Orton and Triple H to take center stage along with Jericho's promos. <br>  Diva - Maria, no ability in the ring but we see her so often in matches and as No1 Contender for Diva's Title.<br>  <br>  Champion <br>  I would personally put the US Title on Chavo. I'm a huge fan of his in-ring work and mic skills and a short title reign could help others appreciate it. <br>  <br>  Feuds<br>  I wanted to see Kane and Orton. The storyline wasn't great but the matches had potential to be....other than this I would like MVP to be drafted to RAW and feud with CM Punk and Regal with Regal remaining heel and either Punk or MVP turning heel. (They both play excellent ones).<br>  Diva <br>  Natalya and Katie Lea. Stick them on a show together, make them feud. Not much else you can do with them for now unless Tiffany and Alicia Fox are joining in.|`|3I6YUfg0aa	Which Superstar has impressed you most recently?<br>  Randy Orton<br>  <br>  Which Diva has impressed you most recently?<br>  Melina<br>  <br>  Which Superstar have you been most Disapointed with?<br>  Chris Jericho<br>  <br>  Which Diva have you been most Dissapointed with recently?<br>  Michelle McCool<br>  <br>  Which Superstar and Diva do you think deserve a Push?<br>  Chris Jericho and Matt Hardy<br>  (This can mean anything from being pushed into Title Contention or a Good Rivalry)<br>  <br>  Which Superstar and Diva needs to take a bit of timeout from The Limelight?<br>  HHH or Edge or Vickie<br>  ( This can mean anything from always being involved in Title Matches or constantly involved with something which someone else could have been used for)<br>  <br>  If you could change any Champion who would it be?<br>  (This can be for any Title, plus who would you like to have in their Place?)<br>  Nope<br>  <br>  Which 2 Superstars or Diva's would you like to see involved in a Feud with each Other?<br>  Orton and Edge-just to see how low 2 heels could go against each other.|`|QpRUNk0laa	Which Superstar has impressed you most recently?<br>  CM Punk<br>  <br>  Which Diva has impressed you most recently?<br>  Melina<br>  <br>  Which Superstar have you been most Disapointed with?<br>  Chris Jericho, come on now, beat up legends,he can do WAY better than that<br>  <br>  Which Diva have you been most Dissapointed with recently?<br>  Beth Pheonix and Jillian.

He has made this rivalry good and he is doing a great run as a heel.<br>  <br>  Which Diva has impressed you most recently?<br>  <br>  Rosa Mendes she has done a great job of being the intern of Glamourella and she is just a really good part of the team.<br>  <br>  Which Superstar have you been most disappointed with lately?<br>  <br>  JBL he has really just annoyed me in the storyline with HBK and he was just horrible at it. If it hadn't of been for HBK that rivalry would of been crap. He has also lately not done so much wrestling but talking.<br>  <br>  Which Diva have you been most disappointed with lately?<br>  <br>  Maryse honestly I know she was injured but her match back really disappointed me and she needs to be a bigger heel.<br>  <br>  Which Superstar and Diva do you think deserve a Push?<br>  <br>  Shelton Benamin he is a great superstar with magnifcent skills but just doesn't get any credit but i am happy that the title reign he has had with the U.S has been a long good reign. He also can wrestle against the best.<br>  <br>  Which Superstar and Diva needs to take a bit of timeout from The Limelight?<br>  <br>  John Cena because he has just been the spotlight for ages and you know all his moves and he just does the same thing and even when he was injured he was in the spotlight so I think he should have a bit of a feud with CM Punk or Kane. Or get into the tag team division.<br>  <br>  If you could change any Champion who would it be?<br>  <br>  ECW Championship only  because Christian is back and i think Swagger is a great superstar but I like Christian and he needs a world title reign.<br>  <br>  Which 2 Superstars or Diva's would you like to see involved in a Feud with each Other?<br>  <br>  Divas I would have Natalya vs Beth Phoenix that would be one of the greatest matches in womens history and they are both very technical and they both have superstars they manage so it could be a great rivalry.<br>  <br>  Superstars: Undertaker vs Chris Jericho would be amazing the storyline everything in my mind and I would love to see that match.<br>  <br>  Good Q Thurlow starred|`|smcDn76jaa	You know Matt Hardy has really impressed me all year. He had a tremendous reign as ECW champion. He had some good matches against Bourne, Finlay, and Swagger. He also had some decent matches with Mark Henry. He seems to be taking this heel role to the highest level possible what with the whole black cloud thing. He seems like he might be putting in some jealousy he has felt about Jeff. Melina is the Diva that is impressing me. She bounced back form an injury pretty fast and with new moves. The TNA star that has impressed me is Matt Morgan. He has been impressive throughout his TNA tenure and he seems to be stepping it up another level. Hopefully this feud with Abyss brings him to the main event scene. There is no Knockout impressing me. They are at the same level as last year. They receive a small push and then get squashed by Kong.<br>  <br>  I am disappointed by TBK. I'm talking about backstage and slightly in the ring. I feel like he could have had better matches, but that might not be his fault. However how he conducts himself backstage is really what's keeping him back and that disappoints me because the only person stopping him from reaching his potential is himself. No Diva, TNA star,or Knockout disappoints me because they are either the same, or they improved.<br>  <br>  John Morrison really desearves a push. I want to see him get pushed into a feud with HBK. They are like mirror images of each other and a feud between these two can make Morrison really go over. I feel Katie Lea should be pushed. She is really talented and I want her to be some sort of Women's champion on ECW, maybe a Vixen's title. I would like her to feud with Natalya. TNA star I want pushed is Awesome Kong. I want her pushed out of the KNockouts division she is too dominate. Maybe pushed into the X Division or tag team division or even the heavyweight division. I want her to feud for some strange reason with Kurt Angle.<br>  <br>  Kozlov needs to be out of the limelight. I'm really getting tired of him. I agree Edge should leave the title scene it's getting annoying. I want all of the MEM to be out of the limelight they are too dominate.<br>  <br>  When Evan Bourne returns I want him and Kofi to be the Tag champs.<br>  <br>  Rivalry I would like to see. John Morrison vs HBK. Rivalry in TNA. I would like to see Matt Morgan vs Kurt Angle or Awesome Kong vs Kurt Angle. Something new and unexpected. <br>  <br>  Boy am I tired.|`|IQZNkeNzaa	wow you must love wrestling with a question like this.<br>  <br>  Don't even know where to begin bro.<br>  <br>  You would get way more answers if it was shorter.|`|T8IFOfHCaa	dude this is the longest question ever

nxymxSUFaa	I'm not so sure that Fehr had anything to do with A-Rod's name being leaked.  However your question has some credence in terms of baseball cleaning up it's act.  I asked a question earlier about perspectives and how people will look at this era of baseball.  How long will it take to cast an objective look on the last 15 years.<br>  <br>  You're right, it's a mess and it's far from being cleaned up.  As I see it if people are being asked to pay ridiculous amounts of money to attend a major league baseball game, then at the very least we should know something about the product we are buying.<br>  <br>  I agree with Chip on one count concerning the leakage and the fact that someone should and must be held accountable.  That will be interesting to keep an eye on.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	You ask that question as if Fehr is the one that leaked the names.

I mean, on one hand, these players did something wrong and deserve anything they get, on the other hand, they were told the test would be anonymous.<br>  <br>  I think Donald Fehr is a complete joke.  I mean, I know his excuse will be that the tests were supposed to be totally anonymous, but lets actually think about why they were anonymous.  The only reason the administered tests were anonymous, is because Donald Fehr fought MLB every step of the way when it came to steroid testing, and wouldn't agree to the tests unless they were anonymous.  He's the reason they are covered up, and he's the person who doesn't want the game cleaned up.  <br>  <br>  I mean, I know he's a union rep and his main job is to protect the players, but how is it protecting them by encouraging cheating and steroid use.  He doesn't care about the game of baseball at all, unless he would have agreed to the steroid testing a long time ago.  For all the people who like to blame Bud, this is the guy to blame.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Who says it was okay to leak Rodriguez' name?<br>  <br>  It should not have been leaked. The information was not only confidential per agreement between MLB and the MLBPA, but it also was under court seal. Even if the information found its way into non-baseball hands (and it did), leaking it was never an option. Heads should roll if the leaker(s) becomes known.<br>  <br>  People's curiosities in wanting to know who else may be on the list must take a back seat to upholding the law here. The list is under seal. We should NOT learn its contents.

IITnJjAjaa	Well track is on an athletics track (lol) it's normally based in the summer. Distances can be as short as 100m as as long as 5km. Wheras, Cross country is on grass/mud. You get very muddy which is great. You run up lots of hills and it's based on long distance running and from juniors its normally around 4km to seniors it's upto 10km.<br>  <br>  I do both, and i could never choose between them both. One helps the other. The track helps my speed and the cross country helps my endurance because i run 800's, 1500's and cross country (: Depending on what your good at e.g 200m then stick to the track if you're better at longer distances, do both or which ever one you prefer. They're both excellent so either is great fun! (<br>  <br>  Btw, Athletics has high jump, but if you're doing track it shouldn't be involved unless you're doing steeplechase!|`|C6VVhNdRaa	Track is short and on a track. Its maximum distance is usually about 2 miles.  Where cross country is off the track and on streets, grass, etc and can stretch from 5 miles and up easily.|`|2a018170ff75d363213a98baeae86b10aa	Cross Country is just long distance running.  One mile and greater.<br>  <br>  Track encompasses all track and field events running, hurdles, shot put, discus, pole vault, jumping events etc.   Usually, you don't have to do all of them to be on the track team.|`|pRklTpuFaa	well...cross country is where you run much longer distances over every type of terrain. cross country runners are usually lightly built (if that makes sense...!)<br>  track involves jumping, sprinting and sprinters are usually more muscly ..<br>  hope i helped!!<br>  :D good luck|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	Sometimes in cross country, they expect you to turn right.|`|VhgyQES9aa	Track is run on a track, cross country is run in the country on grass or sand|`|vmdMVBliaa	In Cross Country you run 3.1 miles on a trail. In track you have multiple events that you do around a track. Track includes sprinting events, running hurdles, and the longest running event is the 1 mile. Track also includes field events such as shot put, discuss, long jump, and high jump. You don't have to be able to jump in order to do track or cross country. You pick whichever event your best at.|`|ISX11RnAaa	wow! how do you not know the difference!?!?! <br>    Sorry. lol ok track is also known as track and field so you can do running or filed events. the running distances are 50,100,200 meter dashes and then the 400,800,1200,and 1600 meter runs. there are also relays. the filed events are shotput (seeing how far you can throw a weighted ball) discus (throwing a weighted frisbee kind of) long jump, and high jump. you dont have to be in both track and field you can specialize in one.<br>    Cross country is long distance usually at least 3 miles. its a lot harder and is more for the serious runner.|`|V3TQOp0aaa	You don't have to jump in track if you don't do hurdles high jump or long jump. Cross Country is long distance, usually about 2.5 to 3.5 miles in a race.  Track is shorter and is around a track obviously. haha.|`|1w6m03RNaa	you do not have jump to do track.

Pq5Ds8F2aa	Nah...I think your over thinking it Greg.But that being said the 4 coaches that got fired where on 4 teams that where predicted to go far this year, and at this point the playoffs are even questionable.People even ranked them all tops. <br>    Europe is a coincidence, but not living up to expectations is the reality.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	Well, I say good luck to the Red Wings next year, cause they are starting in Europe ;) hahaha<br>  <br>  Who knows, i think all the coaches that got fired had it coming in one way or another.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	Just goes to show that if coaches want to keep their jobs, DON'T lose to the Leafs.

I want the lotto numbers . <br>  Interesting thought though.|`|G33E41IBaa	I think it was a good move to fire Renney.  The Rangers are talented; there is no reason for them to underachieve the way they are right now.  We know they're capable of winning.  They were first in the Atlantic, straight, through the first few months of the season, then they just went downhill.  The Rangers have guys like Gomez, Naslund, Redden, Drury, Roszival, Lundqvist, Dubinsky, Mara, Staal, and Zherdev who's just been amazing.  I think with that kind of talent, the Rangers shouldn't just be scraping by in a playoff spot.  Only 2 points separate them from being in or out of the playoffs.  The Rangers also have 19 more goals AGAINST than for!  A lot of non-playoff teams have better numbers than that.  They've had a lot of disappointing games this season - six times (roughly 10% of their games played so far) they have had 6 or more goals scored against them, including that 10-2 loss against the Stars...<br>  <br>  Firing the coach will definitely shake the players up and let them know the Rangers mean business.  Renney just wasn't doing his job to get the talent on his team to work together and win.  The players need to pick it up or it's going to be a looong season (but I hope they still lose because I'm a Devils fan ;-)<br>  <br>  I think part of the reason why many coaches who started the season in Europe were fired is because the teams they coached were considered some of the better teams in the league.  The NHL wasn't going to send a team like the Thrashers to Europe.  They wanted the cream of the crop to play there.  When those teams that were considered good start to slump, firing the coach is necessary because they aren't playing up to their expectations.

Except for recent years, the Cubs are never predicted to finish above 3rd in their division. What's more, If they ARE predicted to win the division, or at least battle for it, there's always an excuse for why they'd win. A lot of analysts say 'it's a weak division', 'the other teams didn't do much in the off season'. Whatever excuse analysts want to come up with, most of them don't say 'the Cubs will win the division outright'. Honestly, year after year the Cubs are always the underdog and get looked over. They're just not given the credit they deserve. Like I said, except for recent years, this is all true about the Cubs.|`|AA11720887	They aren't!

tvuhGTD9aa	No charges of possession, trafficking, distributing, or manufacturing have been brought against any of them.<br>  <br>  Bonds, by his own grand jury testimony, has used steroidal applications. In that same testimony he claims not to have known the true nature of those applications. The DOJ says he's lying about that, and that's the basis of the current indictment against him, charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trial is scheduled to start 02-March.<br>  <br>  McGwire is known to have used androstenedione, which is a steroidal precursor. At the time, 1998, it was a legally available supplement and not prohibited by MLB.<br>  <br>  Sosa -- geez, his name keeps coming up, and certainly the timing and some circumstances are interestingly suspect, but there's never been anything even remotely solid against him re/PEDs.|`|nDzenpkwaa	No, No and No<br>  <br>  I am not wrong.  None of the players you listed have been found guilty of taking any steroids...|`|a42JpX2uaa	Not yet, or not in a court of law.  But the general opinion of people who follow baseball is that they did take steroids.  McGuire would not say whether he did or not in front of Congress, which is seen as an admission by doing so.  Sosa also skirted the question, and Bonds I THINK has admitted that he did it, but thought it was flax seed oil.  Bonds and Sosa also went through dramatic weight changes during their careers.  I heard McGuire looks smaller now, which would indicate he stopped (which also means that he was on it).  I don't know if they will ever be ''proven" guilty, but the baseball world will probably always consider them so regardless.|`|wJd0gNymaa	Bonds is on trial for "lying" to congress about his alleged steroid use. But, because he's trainer won't testify against Bonds, all "evidence" that they have is washed.... meaning it's unusable in the court room. So, he's gonna get off. <br>  <br>  <br>  *If the glove does not fit, you must acquit"- Johnny Cochran during the infamous OJ Simpson Trail|`|CiY9Tkf6aa	They admitted to taking the drugs.

TPZwmQK9aa	You first go to an FFL dealer, or call one, and found out if they will (and what they charge to) accept delivery of the gun and do the paperwork to transfer it to you.<br>  Then you order the gun online and have it delivered to that FFL dealer, go have your background check done there, pay the handling fee to the FFL, and get the gun.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	Living in this anti-gun state, you're going to have a hard time getting someone to ship to an FFL dealer.  California gun laws have become so strict that online gun dealers have stopped shipping to California.  <br>  <br>  If you find one who will, you need an FFL dealer who will accept it.  Handguns must be on the California DOJ approved roster of handguns for sale.  <br>  <br>  Another problem you're going to run into is finding an FFL dealer that isn't going to gouge you.  A $50 transfer fee, including DROS (Dealer's Record of Sale), is good.  More and more, these FFLdealers want $100 to $150 to receive a gun and transfer it over.  There goes your savings down the toilet.  <br>  <br>  IMO, it's not worth it anymore. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dpSr0icwaa	You make arrangements with a local gun dealer to do a 'transfer' i.e. receive the gun, put it in his book, then follow all state and federal laws and sign it out of his book to you. This would include the standard NICS background check.<br>  <br>  A local dealer will often do a transfer for $25.<br>  <br>  You then get a copy of the local dealer's FFL.<br>  <br>  you select your firearm from the website and pay for it, plus shipping and handling.  Next, you mail or fax them the copy of the recipeint's FFL.  Following that, the website staff gets the gun boxed up and mails it or Fed-exes it to your local dealer.<br>  <br>  When it comes to the local dealer, he calls you and tells you it is in.<br>  <br>  You go and verifty the gun is yours.  Next you follow all steps of state and local law just like if you were buying the gun from the local dealer's own inventory.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest browsing for guns online then mentally adding $50 to the price and see if you can just buy it local.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  Because of CAs crazy laws, many gun dealers outside of CA, including a lot of the big online places, simply refuse to do business with CA.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	You order the firearm online and pay using whatever method the website requires and it is shipped to an FFL dealer in your state. You then have to go through the hoops that you would normally have to to buy a firearm in CA.<br>  The exception to this is if you have a curio and relics (C&R) license.

You'll be accountable for knowing them and making sure that the guns you wish to purchase is legal to own in CA.  Ca. has some very restrictive laws.<br>  <br>  Sales of firearms from one person to another (private party transfers) must be performed through a licensed firearms dealer using a Private Party Transfer form. The licensed dealer may charge a $10 fee, in addition to the $25 transfer fee that the state charges. Any number of firearms may be transferred at one time using this method. The dealer will submit a Dealer's Record of Sale (DROS) form to the state, and the purchaser must wait 10 days before picking up the guns from the dealer. Federally defined curio or relic long guns over 50 years old may be sold without going through a licensed dealer.[17]<br>  <br>  Handgun purchases, except for private party transfers, are limited to one per 30 day period. To purchase a handgun, a buyer must have a Handgun Safety Certificate.[18] This is obtained by passing a written test, given by a Department of Justice certified instructor, on the safe and legal use of handguns. The certificate is valid for five years. A buyer must also perform a Safe Handling Demonstration when taking possession of a handgun. Some individuals are exempt from the Safety Certificate and Handling Demonstration requirements, including active and retired military and law enforcement personnel, hunter safety certificate holders, and concealed carry license holders.[19]<br>  <br>  Dealers may not sell any handgun unless it is listed in the Department of Justice roster of handguns certified for sale. Listed handguns must include certain mechanical features and pass a set of laboratory tests. Private party transfers, curio/relic handguns, certain single-action revolvers, and pawn/consignment returns are exempt from this requirement.[20]<br>  <br>  It is illegal to sell a firearm that the state has defined as an "assault weapon", and which has been listed in the DOJ roster of prohibited firearms, which includes many military look-alike semi-automatic rifles and .50 caliber BMG rifles.[21] DOJ rostered firearms may be legally possessed if already registered with the state prior to January 2005. Military look-alike firearms that are not listed on the DOJ roster of prohibited firearms, known as "off list lowers", are legal to own and possess, as long as state laws concerning configuration are followed. It is illegal to import, sell, give, trade, or lend a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition, except for fixed tubular magazines for lever-action rifles and .22 caliber rifles; however, the possession of such magazines is legal. It is illegal to possess an automatic firearm or a short-barreled shotgun or rifle without permission from the Department of Justice; such permission is generally not granted.[22]<br>  <br>  On October 13, 2007, California enacted AB 1471. This controversial[23] law requires that, effective January 1, 2010, semi-automatic handguns be equipped with microstamping technology in order to be listed in the roster of handguns certified for sale. When such a pistol is fired, the microstamping mechanism will imprint each cartridge case with a microscopic array of characters that will uniquely identify the gun that fired it

tzrLDbHWaa	Lowe - I don't know.  I mean I think they should have signed him, or at least tried.  He's been our best pitcher the past few years.<br>  <br>  Penny - Didn't want to come back and is glad to be out of LA.  He clashed with some of the coaches, like Larry Bowa, and also management.  The team didn't like when he offered to pitch through his injury only if we picked up his option for next year as well.  They took it as a selfish "me first" attitude, like he could play if he wanted to, and he could help the team, but would only do it if he financially benefited.  <br>  <br>  Maddux - Wasn't really that great last year.  He's old and done.  I still would have liked to have him around to help our younger pitchers though.<br>  <br>  Saito - I agree.<br>  <br>  While it may look like our pitching is down from last year, I think we'll be fine.  Billingsley is ready to be an ace, and his numbers weren't that far off Lowe's.<br>  <br>  And here's my bold prediction for this season.  Clayton Kershaw will be one of the best pitchers in baseball.  He's turning 21 and entering his 2nd season in the majors.  He was alright last season, put up about a 4 or 4.5 ERA (not looking at his stats) which doesn't look too impressive, but lets compare him to another top lefty, Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum.  Though he's like 3-4 years older, if you look back at Lincecum's rookie season, he posted similar numbers as Kershaw did last year, very similar.  What happened in year 2?  Cy Young.  While Kershaw may not win the Cy next year, he does have one in his future, and he's going to be a beast this season.|`|V430UrvFaa	They seem to be relying on young pitching for the future, I wouldn't worry too much, they still will contend.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I read that Penny was a clubhouse problem, and management wanted him out of there. Saito is always on the shelf. Derek Lowe isn't worth what the Braves paid, let them piss away their money. Maddux, well he was Ok in 1999, but this is 2009 and he's done.<br>  <br>  They improved their staff.|`|9d5001a56ba031ba48358cae82b85660aa	They needed to reform their rotation and bullpen.|`|NCqsnlClaa	<a href="http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/</a>|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Penny had become a liability on the mound and in the clubhouse ... He had gone from "workhorse" to 6-inning guy and when there were questions about his work-ethic, he sulked and left the team.<br>  <br>  Saito was an injury risk.  Other teams could sign him at "injury risk" rates, but his agent would have asked for "Look at all the things I've already done for you" money.<br>  <br>  Maddux was asked by Colletti about staying with the team last Fall, but Maddux was already leaning toward retirement.  The one thing that disappoints me is that he's coaching with the Padres instead of the Dodgers..<br>  <br>  Lowe was a big loss to me, but I understand it.  I still believe that they're going to sign Manny....but had they given Lowe the money he wanted, they wouldn't have to money to make him an offer.<br>  <br>  As for the pitchers available, they were not going to get Sabbathia or Burnett and Colletti looks pretty smart to have passed on Sheets.  After that, who was left?  Livan Hernandez?  Russ Ortiz?  I worry about Billingsley in the "Ace" role, but Lowe was the only other one out there and it was clear that the Braves were willing to offer more years and more money.<br>  <br>  Whether they're being cheap or gun-shy after foolish deals they gave Schmidt and Pierre, the Dodgers have held to their strategy of "low dollars, short terms or both" approach with free agents.|`|nH8AV9Soaa	They were and still are soooo obsessed with signing Manny Rameriez that they really didnt care about anyone else.|`|XgAea2Olaa	they needed new players and they had to trade the old players thats how the game of baseball goes|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Get better players.|`|q0xFtWt4aa	Two Words...MANNY!!!

cOPCNP7Laa	Firstly to Freshy. You have to know English people do not consider England part of Europe. It has refused to adopt it's monetary and financial system though part of the EC but believe me, I'v had MANY arguments challenging their belonging to "Europe" but the arguing parties (english people) never game up their insisted assertion that England is NOT part of Europe and when they talk they refer to Europe as mainland Europe.<br>  <br>  Secondly half of what is written is BS. They have taken some bad points about both countries and societies and have magnified them 10 times to make them look worse and ridiculous. <br>  <br>  But overall the comparisons on a general basis are right. I have to say however that I am proud of being an Italian who has experienced English life and society. I feel I have gotten the best out of the two, and sometimes it meant taking out the bad from one or the other - I gained from it ;)<br>  <br>  I watch games standing up at the San Siro but would never throw a seat. I drink many pints of beer before a game but whether home or away I never go mad. Stewards at San Siro watch the crowd but also the game. I've become an Anglo-Italian. <br>  <br>  Oh, and I LOVE my British accent ;)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	lool<br>  Actually, make us all a PowerPoint Presentation and have visuals included. :))|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Ugh,English people consider Jordan a babe?<br>  <br>  I'm doubtful about number 15,just look at Hicks and Gillett and Roman Abramovich.They're in the spotlight almost as often as their club.Number 18 made me lol.Anyway,Italy sounds strangely similar to Asia.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	I love it how England doesn't consider itself a part of Europe.

AGqnjmgpaa	surfing for sure is easier, the water is warm, the only thing you need our board short and sun cream, no chair lifts come on the list goes on, but i like snowboarding too, but surfing is what i call a full time job and it pays great|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Snowboarding cause your all bundled up in gear. Surfing mo bettah!|`|KkkugCJ0aa	surfing is 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times harder to learn..after a 25 dollar lesson and a day of boarding you'll be tearin' down the bunny slope..after a month of lessons and surfing 3 times a week you'd be lucky to be able to even ride a wave at an angle correctly|`|k4UKTpedaa	Surfing!!!! There's a lot more to surfing than just stand up and getting a wave. Boarding is easy, I see a lot of fallen leafs on the slopes these days no front side (toe turns), so you just get an edge and kind of slide down the hill, fall on your bottom when you start to go down. The slopes won't change on your next run either. The hardest part of boarding is getting on and off the chairlift, where surfing is total different just about every time you go out. Just learning how to paddle on a board is hard, find your balance sitting on a board. Then try paddling to get a wave (don't pearl) and standing up. Is the wave a left or a right (frontside backside). Once your up is the wave mushy or breaking at mach 2 speed, is it going to close out, or hold up. That's the one thing about surfing I really enjoy, when you are up and on a wave no other outside thoughts come to mind your totally focus on the task at hand. Where boarding you have your I-Pod to mess with, whens lunch,  is that girl or guy single, how's my hair and clothes look, Blah Blah. So to learn Surfing, to master I'm sure they are pretty close, but I would go with Surfing again. GETWET|`|xal0P1rNaa	Surfing.  You're standing on an unstable surface, you have to propel yourself not only out to the wave but also you must match your speed with the wave to catch it.

It is harder to learn, because you have to get used to the balance its a lot easier on snow but once you get the hang of it surfing is more fun

qlJ0anfAaa	I agree. I haven't really liked Kobe for a long time. He's a great player, but he seems to have an attitude. I really respect players that know that the reason they are great is because of their TEAM ... players like Kevin Garnett for example. Kobe seems to into getting HIS points.<br>  However I am kinda biased, since I've been born and raised a celtics fan. Still, I am never a fan of any players who are more into their own stat sheets than their team's.<br>  <br>  Sincerly,<br>  a devout basketball fan|`|ur1bnkrZaa	your retarted.<br>  that was almost 3 years ago!<br>  things have changes dramatically since then.<br>  he has won a mvp made it to the finals and this year has the best record in the nba.<br>  at the time he had kwamie brown and smush parker as starters. you would be pissed to. but i do understand whereYour coming from. you like a crappy team that was ripped apart by the seems by steve kerr. so not much else to talk about this year but how u hate kobe ha ha. let the haters hate. 44-10 best record in west. whats up with suns?<br>  <br>  hahaha. good luck making it to the playoffs you wack *** MOFO|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Dude, why do you guys keep bringing up the past? it's over with, move on!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Shouldn't you be worried about your own basketball team?<br>  you should be disgusted by the way your "team" have been playing this year.|`|wIO7KJ2laa	That's the way it is in the NBA. Someday, probably not too far away, Bynum is going to the be the MAN on this team and Kobe will be a fading star. Let's see if Bynam plays it cool and lays off of the Kobester.|`|65H77wolaa	not even a video., sputid! lol|`|i5MInqeMaa	Yes i am, thanks for asking.|`|BiMkowVMaa	Are you stuck in the past or is this the only thing you could come up with from 2+ years ago?<br>  <br>  Man you lose one guy for the rest of the year...<br>  <br>  EDIT: The guy above me.

Nowadays everyone blames the other when their team is under performing.  I don't ever remember Magic or Bird blaming their teammates for losing the NBA finals.  As fans, we shouldn't be too concern about their complaints.  They get so many millions to play and yet they complaint when they don't win.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	ok first off i'm not downloading that zango crap... ive seen the video on youtube..<br>  I will never be disgusted with Kobe. so the answer to your question is no.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	I'm always Disgusted with Kobe Bryant.|`|uoIV59V6aa	stfu hater
UHTcpdkVaa	I love the classes that I take, and I consider them to be the "fun" thing that I do during the week.  As to which is fun for you - you never know until you try.<br>  <br>  For me, I don't want to compete in tournaments (that's just not fun for me) so I take arts that don't have them.  I enjoy the intellectual challenge of the arts, to I took one that was more mental than physical.  Interestingly enough, later on the lower physicality of that art started to bore me (and my personal goals evolved), so i added a new art that was much more physical, yet still mentally engaging.<br>  <br>  I don't like getting hit, so something like boxing was right out.  As I got more experience, I found that getting hit bothered me less and less, but I still wouldn't like getting pounded on so I avoid those arts because it isn't fun to me.<br>  <br>  Each person is different.  Each person has different goals.  What you want to do is find a class that is fun for you, and advances your goals at the same time.  Notice that I said class and not art - because each art can be taught in many different way - some will be fun for you, and some will be fun for others.<br>  <br>  Since your dad wants you to do it - you'll probably have to try at least one - my recommendation is to try MANY.  Almost all class will offer a free intro class - go and try out as many as you can.  Some will totally suck for you, and some will rock your socks.  Eventually you may get enough information to decide that you like [X art] so you'll focus on classes in that art only.  But in the beginning, it's not uncommon to try out as many different arts as are available until you learn enough about what makes each unique.  If you let the teacher know from the get go - "I'm trying to find out what fits me best" - they will let you try out as much as you can to help you out; and still not be pissed if you never come back.<br>  <br>  Depending on your area, this could mean months of free classes!  And that's always fun.<br>  <br>  (Oh, the arts that I enjoy are Aikido and Capoeira - but like I said, these may bore the crap out of you, or you may love them - IDK)|`|bqqGZfiSaa	I will tell you the first few months will not be "fun" if your a slow learner like me- all you will feel is pain and frustration but once you get the hang of it and start sparing it get going,  its a lot of fun. competing is fun. Really depends on what you like I prefered karate over tkd but my friend is the exact oposite give it a try. Im a completly different person do to martial arts and I have like a second family- my senseis are like second parents to me and the other students are my brothers and sisters. But now my whole life revolves around karate- i love it|`|TnTXGNyMaa	yes its really fun, i dont suggest you take karate, tkd or kung fu. I suggest you take something like brazilian jiu jitsu, its a good art, and will be useful to you for self defense, they will teach you chokes, locks, takedowns.  Not to mention bjj is like a family. Do what you like doing though, go check out some different martial arts and see wht u like the best:)|`|r5AMG8g7aa	It has been fun for me for nearly 42 years. But then you must realize that asking the martial arts section if they like it is like asking someone in the Church Choir if they like to sing.|`|YPzfSYc4aa	Personally, although I am biased, I am a big fan of most martial arts. I myself have been doing Ju-Jutsu for 6 years and have loved every minute. It's a great way to meet new people and gain tons of confidence in the process. I wouldn't recommend you join unless you can control yourself and will be dedicated. You won't regret a second of it. The feeling of security whilst out alone is incredible and you'll be surprised at how much it contributes to fitness.<br>  In terms of the "best" martial art there really isn't a clear winner however I would like to recommend Ju-Jutsu. It is a self defence art that also focuses a lot on a sports side. The community is polite and easy to get along with. I wouldn't recommend Karate as it consentrates more on looks rather than the defence side.<br>  Anyway I could talk forever on the matter however I feel that should surfice and help you.<br>  Hope that helped<br>  ~JD~|`|5HLAOoz9aa	Martial arts are a whole lot of fun. No matter what martial arts class you take (I am biased but I am using a general view for the best answer possible) they are all enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Now it depends on what you would call the most fun. It all depends on you. <br>  <br>  If you have little time or patience, try karate or an easy one like that. Not to diss it, but I don't think karate goes very deep.<br>  <br>  I personally recommend authentic kung fu. This is why:<br>  <br>  --oodles of styles, like mantis, taming tiger ( a basic form ), drunken monkey, eight immortals staff and sword, etc. LOTS OF CHOICE!<br>  <br>  --patience, young grasshopper. You don't go straight to forms; you build up your basics. And boy, these take up longer than you think.<br>  <br>  --endurance. In authentic kungfu, you build up your endurance. Like, really. After spending a while in kung fu, I got hit hard by a football and thought some one was literally just patting me on the back. You can endure a LOT more.<br>  <br>  In any martial art, you build up self-defense. I strongly recommend this; our nation needs to get stronger and safer. I feel confident that I, a little 5'1'' midget, could severely hurt and get away from someone who wanted to hurt me.<br>  <br>  Enjoy, and I hope you choose a great martial art.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Its a lot of 'serious' fun.  Like studying for a final exam in college on a subject you really like.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	one of the funnest things besides sex<br>  you learn, you train, you get better, then you test yourself<br>  tournaments are fun, training is fun, sparring is fun, street fights are fun<br>  martial arts is especially fun when you beat the crap out of other people
ENBhz7Asaa	As an OU Sooners fan, I thought Harvin should have been the MVP of the Nat. Champ. Game over Tebow.  That dude (Harvin) is F A S T , fast.  I think he'll do well at the next level.|`|UiewAPE3aa	He will probably flop in the pool.<br>  Seriously he would be better off if he had return experience.|`|u3JjH9azaa	yes most of the pretty good college player recently don't do so great in the nfl|`|WBjZGnpiaa	No.... he will make the Chicago Bears a good big Play threat. they need this guy.
a6EndAPiaa	If this were true his college football career would  be over; so, I am going to go out on a limb and say no he has not done that.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	I'm pretty sure according to NCAA rules he can't do that yet, although it certainly wouldn't be a bad idea for him to consider in the future.|`|cypNCoh3aa	Won't happen.  He may pull a Flutie and go to Canada after flopping in the NFL (and trust me, he will flop) but he won't start his pro career in Canada.  At least not voluntarily (and someone will give him a chance mid-to-late in the 2010 draft.)|`|l3y23yVcaa	Flutie was the MAN...|`|v7hkYRDLaa	Tebow might make a great NFL safety.

Zymxhc7Jaa	Possibly, not as a contributor but as a sort of mentor to the young wr's there.

He would fit on the skins well.<br>  <br>  Overpriced, over-the-hill player that is past his prime and just wants to cash in one more time.|`|A6AJ6nxLaa	yeah maybe, but the redskins have picked up alot of talent in the past few seasons, but they just can't win|`|UiewAPE3aa	If he had anything left the colts would keep him.|`|cypNCoh3aa	They have a lot more to worry about than to sign an old receiver that's way past his prime.  If Harrison was the final piece of the championship puzzle it would make sense, but the Redskins already have enough average to slightly above average WRs, which is what Harrison is at this point.  That cap money is better spent elsewhere.|`|15qceXaOaa	yeah! harrison is amazing!|`|YFFhkRSdaa	heck no he is done he has no speed he is done he should take anything he gets from the colts
dpSr0icwaa	contrary to what was posted above, there is no "Gunfacts.com" or anything else like Carfacts.com<br>  <br>  however, if your dealer is a FFL (Federal Firearms Licenced Dealer...which he needs to be to run a gunshop), he is really risking serious jail time and loosing all his inventory on lying if a gun is new or used.  I don't see him bothering to do that just to increase the sale price $100|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* He would not still be in business if he was screwing anybody.*|`|4SF4KGu4aa	To the best of my knowledge, the only way to trace a gun is through BATF. I worked with them when I was still a policeman and they could trace a gun in about 10 days if all information was given them. It will only saw when it was made and the first place it was shipped to. Then they ave to get that stores bound book and see who the gun was sold to. <br>  <br>  BATF will not do this for the average citizen. There is no listing of "registered" guns. Unless you state requires it, there is no actual registration of than what BATF can find. If it says it is new, and the price is fairly consistent with that model being sold elsewhere and the box and all papers are with it AND the condition is like new, then I wouldn't worry.|`|WBjZGnpiaa	if he is a licensed gun dealer he must be upfront on if it is used or new. if it is sold as new it come with a warranty and registration card for the manufacture. if you really have more questions then that you can take the S# done and call the police dept or even a pawn shop and they should be able to tell you is the gun has ever been registered.|`|HgU1rNTsaa	I am un sure of tracking a guns serial number but if you ask your dealer to remove the hammer or bolt than you should see clearly if the wear and tear is actual firing of multiple rounds or just cocking the gun (which happens often as shoppers browse and feel)

Instead he had to make due with players like Edgar Bennett, Antonio Freeman, Robert Brooks, Dorsey Levens, Mark Chmura, etc. <br>  <br>  Not to say that those players were not good, but Favre himself spent most of his career in Green Bay as an ACE among Jacks... if you get the analogy and management did NOTHING to help the situation.

W1GHZW3Caa	he had Randy Moss and his offense isn't the greatest of all time. You know why because their defense kept getting them the ball. THey had more opportunities than the 04' colts. Notice manning in 04' had like 80 less attempts and only 3 less total touchdowns. Marvin Harrison is not as good as Randy Moss. Also Brady had almost an entire yard per attempt less 80 more attempts less rating and 3 more lost fumbles but that might not be his fault. You may say Manning has more ints but brady has more turnovers over all. Remember awareness in the pocket is also a quarterback skill.

He had the support of an amazing defense, as well as a great line, and the best gameplanner in the history of the game as his coach. Brady always had a decent offense around him, but he lacked a great receiver before Moss and Welker came to town - they made the offense exceptional.<br>  <br>  No one argues about Brady's success without a great set of WR's. What they do argue is if he had as much to do with their success as his defense and offensive line. Since 2007, he's had an incomprable offense around him - the best line in the league, the best underneath receiver in the league, an underrated running game, and the best deep threat in the league. What people are saying is that he has a ton of OFFENSIVE talent now. Before, he had a ton of DEFENSIVE talent.<br>  <br>  Basically, many people think Brady is getting too much credit for what his team accomplishes. However, the only contemporary QB who has been anywhere near as competitive as Brady has been with similar talent at WR is McNabb. Brady deserves credit, but I don't think he's better than Manning.|`|g4cYFVrmaa	Because Brady makes playing QB look easy.|`|0821af06fe4e702880d804a9e2cc13e0aa	they were better last year without him.

bLhTwPqIaa	I agree with both your points there, but as it is a Celebration WrestleMania it would be nice to see a few 1 off comebacks, but then again we normally do like with The Royal Rumble, but this year it is likely to be a few more. Remeber without these legends there would not be a WrestleMania today because if they did not put on the great performances they did including Hulk Hogan (Although not many will admit to liking him anymore, but he still had alot to do with making WWE what it is today) then things would not have been so popular and would not still be going on now, so I guess this is WWE's way of thanking them.<br>  <br>  By the way I have not had a BA for ages, not asking for one, but just saying as you think TC's get them all. As for me giving them I dont care if The Best Answer is from a TC or anyone. If I like it best thats the one I will pick.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	Well the wwe has bring back stars like hulk hogan rowdy piper etc to bring in more fans for wrestle mania and for more $$$ and since wrestle mania is biggest event off the year they only put big stars in big matches cause what vince cares about is the ratings and the doller doller|`|poc3xrCeaa	I totally agree with you i am a big fan of wrestling and if they keep bringing back old stars and not pushing new younger talent im afraid that wrestling will disappear from our screens over the next few years.

BEgSXcZaaa	The first thing you need to work on is hand placement.  You probably have small hands, so only one finger should be above the seams.  By seams I mean the white laced part of the football.  Next when you are getting ready to throw the ball keep both hands on it until your ready to throw.  The ready position which is located near your ear, if you have ever played baseball or softball, just think of it as playing catcher or making a quick throw from Short or Second.  The ball should also be slightly angled up where as your hands are slightly rotated towards your body. This helps when you release the ball.  Next when you begin to throw your body should be squared at your target and weight back on your back foot.  When you step, your weight will transition from back to front.  When throwing the ball, your index finger will be last to leave the ball, and it you should follow through to you pocket.  Things to remember is to square your shoulders, index finger is the last to come off, follow through to opposite pockey.  Also don't grip the ball so tight.  Hope that helps|`|qExNjtTqaa	if they have already showed u and u still cant get it, maby u just cant get it<br>  play reciever instead or something on d|`|YMoOsKGCaa	hold it and throw it.|`|y4ZB492oaa	you put your hand on the football and throw it

dpSr0icwaa	wood has better looks<br>  <br>  wood often has a bit more weight which in theory makes it recoil a little less, but with a 25-06 that shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  synthetic stocks have a bit more flex and that itself often absorbs some of the recoil.  Further, and probably more important, synthetic stocks do not change at all with high or low humidity conditions, nor at all but the most extreme conditions.  This means you aren't going to have your stock swell up a little and press on the barrel changing point of impact|`|StDPJ7bXaa	Look for the T3 in a laminated stock.

Some players are just meant to be skinny.|`|Z03zgM0maa	It's possible but we'll never know. You can't judge players in that way because somebody could just say "if LeBron was 5 feet tall he wouldn't be in the NBA". It's also like questioning people like Yao and saying "oh he would suck if he wasn't 7 foot 3". The point is, they are, and that is why they play the way they do. They were gifted with great genes and now the are in the NBA because of it. Durant could be 50 pounds heavier and 5 inches taller but that means he would have to change his playing style.

Grid is an arcade type racer. I don't know what to expect from this game. I just miss the days when F1 games were made and licensed by multiple developers. Exclusive license deals mean no competition. No competition means no chance for us to look for other options if this game sucks.|`|GL3TbtHBaa	I have a $60 gift card sitting in my wallet just waiting for this game to release. I cannot wait. I will buy the Steering wheel and everything. In fact its the only reason i bought an XBOX360.

On average, the gun will take 3-5 days to reach you, after about 7 days, you should call in and check the order delivery.  I am familiar with the staff, and they are very willing to help you if there is a problem.|`|zKMvdGruaa	It will usually take 1 week or 7 days for an order from airsoft gi to reach me, I live in the east coast also. Since you ordered on Sunday, most likely what will occur is Monday they will test and ship it, or Tuesday, they have already tested it and then they will ship it. Expect the gun on Monday, UPS doesn't deliver on Weekends usually.

AA11016927	Hmmm.....Well, ugh......#1. I would not place a ton of confidence in those Humminbird cast-able fish finders. <br>  <br>  Because, the pixels/contrast on those units aren't very high you could be picking up 6" Bluegills, sticks, schools of minnows, Etc. <br>  <br>  However, your Carp situation may be a major issue.<br>  <br>   If I were you I'd become a Carp fisherman and start making some "carp fertilizer", (if you know what I mean). Carp RUIN natural Bass/Bluegill habitat by eating everything "green" and leaving lakes barren of any weeds. I've seen it happen over and over in Florida lakes/ponds. People/real estate company's think by putting a couple hundred Carp in a lake/pond it will keep the weeds down and help a lake stay "pretty", BUT, 9 times out of 10 it ends up causing a fish kill. <br>  <br>  Grass Carp have no real natural predators in a man-made or small lake/pond. Because of this, they just continue to eat and grow. After 2-3 years 8-10 medium-sized Carp can literally devastate a 100 acre Florida pond! Can you imagine what 100 Carp would do to a lake?<br>  <br>  The reason your Bass, (if those are Bass and not Bluegill or misreads), are suspending is probably because the weed-beds/vegetation they would normally hide in & stage around are disappearing. <br>  <br>  Weeds and water-plants add nutrients and O2 to a lake, once the Carp EAT all the plants guess what happens? <br>  <br>  Fish begin dying. <br>  <br>  I've seen lakes/ponds have huge fish kills (due to Carp) SO bad that the lake could only support Mudfish, frogs, & minnows. <br>  <br>  A good idea would be to make some Fish attractors so your fish have a place to hide from Osprey, birds and other predators.....<br>  <br>  X-mas trees, wire-wrapped bundles of palm fronds weighted down with cinder-blocks, Etc. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps somehow......<br>  <br>  Here's some info on Grass Carp in Fla- <a href="http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/grasscarp.html" rel="nofollow">http://plants.ifas.ufl.edu/guide/grassca...</a>|`|amlmhoUuaa	Use a suspending crankbait or a spinnerbait or like you said try a topwater presentation|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Use a spinner bait like the ole tried and true H & H if they are suspended 2-4 Ft. I get the yellow and black ones: Black head with yellow skirts or yellow and black skirts:  What my girl friend does is knock the paint off the head then she paints them red with her fingernail polish.  And if you are going to be fishing in murky water she uses a sparkly looking red. They seem to work best for some reason.  She saying it makes it look like blood in the water.<br>  That also works when fishing for crappie. We buy yellow Beetle spins and I knock the paint off the head while she paints the heads red with her nail polish.<br>  .  <br>  Use a worms (purple, red, etc.) if they are suspended 2-4 inches: And if water is read murky we usually switch to worms with metallic flakes in them.<br>  <br>  If you are going to be fishing on top use a double propeller bait like a skip jack. <br>  .<br>  As far as finding them along the edges you will just have to do some scouting watching for were you see them striking the surface. Also looking for any sunken logs or logs partially in the water. <br>  A couple days of scouting will sure save a lot of wasted effort when you start fishing.

NDbx9CSvaa	I also wonder the same thing. One reason why people hate him are that they are die hard fans of the top 3 and lately Murray has been defeating them all so they see him as a threat to their fav players so they state lame reasons like his play style is boring or that he's arrogant and thats why they hate him.<br>  <br>  What's so boring about his style of play? He goes to the net more often than Novak and Rafa and he goes for lot more winners than Rafa as well. Besides, if something he does works against the best then how can that be bad?<br>  <br>  Then of course you got other lame reasons like he thinks he's the best. Now, I don't remember him making such statements to the effect. I can believe a guy like Novak making such statements (or even federer making them in front of the press) but Murray is quite gracious in the things he says just like Rafa. Yea, on court he does seem a little arrogant and specially his muscle flexing, but then Rafa also does that at times.<br>  <br>  His haters must have got special satisfaction when Murray got booted in the 4th round at the OZ open, but they fail to realise he lost to Verdasco, the same chap who pushed Nadal to the brink (that semi final was way better than the final also), who was the eventual winner. So, while losing to Verdasco was nothing short of a disgrace in the past, there was no shame in losing to him at the aussie open since he played way above his ability. I hope for Verdasco's sake it wasn't a one off display and that he can keep up his high level of tennis too!|`|AA12034105	I don't dislike Murray at all, I think he's a great player :)<br>  I think a lot of people in Britain can't stand the British press cause as soon as he wins one minor tournament he's the world's greatest to them haha :P<br>  He used to be arrogant and like a spolit child but he's matured a lot in the last couple of years and it's done him a lot of good :)|`|plvFEEqNaa	i'll put a different twist to it.<br>  i guess some will agree, and some will be pissed at it...<br>  <br>  personality wise...murray has grown up a lot since his tantrum throwing days...however his on court demeanor seemingly potrays him as a boring player, one which not many would like to associate themselves with...<br>  <br>  see with rafa...the fans see his heart and determination.<br>  fedex...they see masterful strokes and pure elegance.<br>  nole...a joker on court that makes high risk shots every chance he gets.<br>  murray...is a big question mark???<br>  <br>  + i neither like nor dislike him but i think its just a "face" problem...murrays got the kinda face that is hard to fall in love with...well thats bout the best way i can put it|`|KReWaGFsaa	1. He's arrogant<br>  2. He's rude/disrespectful<br>  3. He plays boring tennis<br>  4.

He yells and puts down his opponents to give himself a slight edge. He's also arrogant and thinks he's the best. He considers himself above any of the other players. Even the ones ranked higher than him. Those are basically the reasons I dislike him.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's true that Djokovich is arrogant also, but just because he is too doesn't excuse Murray when he's arrogant<br>  <br>  He's a great player, but he could use some maturity|`|hRoR7AY8aa	he is an arrogant person and player and does not have a likebale personality or any class unlike the 3 players above him.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Yea i guess people thing he's arrogant but i dont see that in him. I like him.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	LOL what's not to hate!<br>  just kidding!<br>  <br>  You know it's stupid, but the only reason I hate him is because of his "muscle" flexing, and the fact that he beat Gasquet in that match...kind of a bitter reason to not like him, but hey, I'm a bitter person!|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Im not sure. I guess people dont like him because he`s scottish, which is stupid really. Also i hear many say his appearance angers them lol again not something you should judge him on, its about his tennis and to me i think he has a great talent.<br>  <br>  Im scottish and love the fact we have finally somebody in tennis who is doing great and a big contestant for the Grandslams. However im not a fan of Andy Murray, i`ll give him credit when he plays amazing and deserved to win however he just annoys me, the way he acts on court its irritating i suppose he`s got a little bit better but still the guy drives me crazy. lol<br>  <br>  If its purely based on tennis tho i have to admit he is an amazing player and will he win a slam? Yes at some point, duno about this year but he certainly has the talent.|`|s359lZj4aa	Its because of an incident that happened about 2 years ago. During the football world cup, he was joking around and he said that he would be supporting any team against England. It was just a joke, but a lot of people took it really seriously. He apologized for it, but a lot of people still hold grudges.<br>  <br>  And some people might think he's an arrogant player because one time he got really mad during a match and he swore at the umpire. Britain had to pay a fine for it of about ￡1,500.|`|iyDXt5d9aa	-Bad attitude<br>  - Arrogant!<br>  - Blech!|`|k6M48eUMaa	Because he is the most arrogant player currently on tour. Eughhh.
1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Northern pike are an aggressive fish and I have caught them on just about everything I have fished with.  Fishing them with a jig and minnow is one of my favorite techniques but surface baits, spoons, spinnerbaits and soft plastics all work well.  Because of their versatility, the soft plastics are getting more popular all the time and consistently provoke strikes.  Crankbaits work well in deeper water and trolling.  I catch more on live bait than anything mostly because of all the ice fishing I do with tip ups.  I will be targeting some big ones this week as our open season for northern ends in about a week and a half or so.  I have also had a lot of success trolling an inline spinner, like a Mepp's, with a minnow on it and throwing a weedless spoon with some pork rind.  It depends on the time of the year and where the majority of the pike are located that determines which technique works best.  Good luck!|`|vv0v03SHaa	There are two many lures to even mention.

LGVrhTFTaa	All I know that he is eligible at 1st+OF on Yahoo.<br>  (And that wont change if he doesn't play any 1st base this year.)<br>  I drafted him in the 7th round of a 12 team league.And I think he'll hit me 40,or more bombs..But,I've offered him+a top closer to several opponents for there top 5 1st baseman.(I intentionally drafted lots of closers to use them as add ons in trades.)<br>  <br>  Still,if there's no takers,me winning the league is a "Dunn Deal" either way!<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|8kTCCKadaa	i think I'd use him at 1st, because Big Slow from WWE can run faster and field better than Dunn.

gM0pk41jaa	Practicing on your own time is the key. 3 years ago i was in the same situation. I was 14...about 6'0 tall and i didnt have all the skills i needed to be the best i could be. So the summer of 2005 i worked my *** off...i played in my driveway by myself....practiced shooting....dribbling....working on my hops etc. The results were immense. I went from not being able to tuch rim to dunking in one summer....got better at shooting threes....my handle increased a bit and i got a little stronger. And this was all done by  myself on my own time(no coach, no tutuor nothing) It helps to have a trainer or coach but all you really need is yourself and dedication. ALso i recorded NBa games and watched key players moves and manevers. And at 5'11, 180 lbs and ONLY 14...man thats scary. You will only get taller, an dbigger naturally as you grow and so if i were you...id make myself a deadly shooter and great ballhandler so by the time ur my age(17) ull be a monster on the court with size and skill|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Practice makes better.|`|sBrYcT5daa	Use Roids, it works well for the NBA players...|`|VHphDgrhaa	Practice.|`|uoIV59V6aa	practice
CttL3LmBaa	Ok. First there is no "good quality" and "cheap", sorry.<br>  Second there is no road bike you can ride on tri's for $200.  Unless you are buying used, an entry level bike -- meaning of good quality and a reasonable price -- is going to be nearer to $900 than to $200.   Check out the bicycle stores in your area and see what you like, and get them to help you on sizing.  Check out craigslist.org and ebay for a gently used machine.  A used bicycle should cost between 2/3 to 1/2 of the original price depending on condition -- If it is more than 5 years old it should be on the lesser side.<br>  <br>  Take your time.  Check out Trek, Giant, Cannondale, Raliegh, Fuji, Felt, Bianchi, Orbea, Specialized, and Professional (from a bike shop not Wal-Mart) Schwinn.  You can do that on Google first.  Then make your rounds of the bike stores.   Ask them more questions as you have them.  Bike shops are a wealth of knowledge.  Read this web site to wet your appetite. <br>  <a href="http://sheldonbrown.com/articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://sheldonbrown.com/articles.html</a><br>  <br>  Welcome to road cycling.|`|YE87HP26aa	Look in your local bike shop or thrift store(for used ones(have it tuned up by a mechanic))<br>  The only brand I would stay away from are huffys. Try to get a high end bike if you can, such as: Trek, Raleigh, Cannondale, or Specialized

IITnJjAjaa	Because of my medial tibial stress syndrome, i run 2/3 times a week. I also sometimes go on a nordic ski machine, i cycle once or twice and i go swimming. One of my runs is always speed (e.g 15x200m reps), the other distance (e.g 8 miles). At the track meet, i get my number, pin it on my vest, drink tonnes of water, eat a banana wait for my event, warm up jogging round the track then i race then afterwards me and my friends mess about and have fun and then i go home and i'm either feeling great because i've smashed my pb or rubbish because i did rubbish lol. Track is amazing, it's soo fun and i love it!<br>  <br>  Well depending on what distances your planning to do, just running 4 miles isn't the right sort of training. For example if you run 800m like me, you need to do 100m reps, fartleks round 400m track, hill reps, circuit training, 400m reps, 1km reps, 8 mile run ect.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lightweight spikes suitable for your event (asics are best). Drink plenty of water before your race and just have fun (:|`|a6fgG0gRaa	well at my school we usually run inside the school and we have to do the "library block" which is like 10 times aroudnd the outside of our library..then our coach came up with a thing to do with htat...but once we get outside me(distance) we would end up doing some kind of sprints all practice becuase are coach was gay! and you should be well off being able to run 2 miles non stop for now because they will condition u to be able to do more|`|1w6m03RNaa	It all depends on how good you want to be. I am also going to run track next year and I will also be in 9th grade. this is how I train <br>  monday 3 miles<br>  tuesday 4 mile repeats <br>  wednesday rest<br>  thursday 5 miles<br>  friday rest <br>  saturday 7 miles<br>  <br>  you do not have to run this many miles just keep on doing what you are doing and you will get better.I like you name.|`|6BZ6m0Quaa	Well I'm a really good runner I just don't like track. But I really know  a lot about it. It matters on what event you want. Let's say your event is the mile. If you train for the mile before the track season starts that would help you. <br>    My event is the mile and I trained year around for it without training your not good. My seventh grade year I made it to state with a 5:20 mile but the only way I got there was by going to practice and training in off season. Your high-school coach is probably going to plan  your practices. I hope you like track! I used to like but I done to much running lately! <br>                         Scott
NXktxy8jaa	I Agree With You.<br>  <br>  People Need To Realize That Chris Jericho Is Doing What The Script Writers Are Telling Him To Do. They Always Take It Way Too Seriously. It Is A Script People, Get Over It!<br>  <br>  And What He Has Been Saying The Past Few Weeks Are True. Some Wrestlers Don't Get Recognized While Others Do Even If They Have Accomplished Less.|`|rphR4pXKaa	Good question, I kinda......no, no, no, I really hate Y2J now but i guess that means he's doing his job, but I wouldn't really care and he left. Plus when he left there was no big hole in wrestling.... no big deal to the fans. He's a good wrestler but damn, change his gimmick or something he's just lame now....I cant even see Y2J turning face for now or probably never after all he's done (including the fan incident).|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Since he is arguably the best wrestling in the world today, yes i care! Right now i love to hate Jericho, i have been a fan since i saw him in WCW 11 years ago and because he is so good i hate him right now! exactly how i should feel! Jericho has done something very brave in his heel turn, dropped everything that made Y2J a superstar and done a complete 180. Jericho works as a heel because he is speaking the truth we wrestling fans are what he says we are and he is a master of working a crowd. If Jericho leaves the company would have an hole no one could fill because there are very few that can wrestle as well as jericho, talk as well as jericho and get the reaction Jericho does!<br>  <br>  ladies and gentleman now more than ever before RAW IS JERICHO!|`|3G2kI3Vqaa	It was Jericho's idea for him to turn heel!!!  He likes being the heel better than he does face.  He doesn't want to go back to being a face!  He was not pushed aside for anyone!!|`|9Us6XYg8aa	No really.<br>  <br>  But he is right people are hipactats.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Chris Jericho.<br>  My personal favorite wrestler of the current generation and one of the top for favorite wrestlers in history. <br>  <br>  No, a face turn is not in his near future but is that bad? He is arguably the 2nd greatest heel after Edge (Randy Orton rounding out the top 3.) His heel turn put him in another great feud with Shawn Michaels, won him 2 world championships in just his first year after his return, and has made him really show off his amazing wrestling ability and mic skills. <br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question, I didn't understand the entire thing of it and this was what I thought you meant...|`|IMQm9JTMaa	Bottom-line is he shouldn't be dising legends, hall-of-famers, past wrestlers. They got him to where he is right now. They made the company what it is today, without them WWE might be nothing. To tell you the truth, I don't care for him lately. He needs to turn face.|`|4THkC6Pgaa	completely disagree with you, jericho has always been the most entertaining superstar since his debut and it would be a shame if he was to leave wwe again, i must admit though, i'm annoyed that he's not at his y2j gimmick anymore but he will become face again.|`|ETkqlgqwaa	Now that you bring that up.. no. He's boring now. He has no big enemies.  And is in no good fueds. He's really running his mouth 90 % of the time. I tevo Raw, and I fast forward him.|`|0wQYJCxfaa	Yes it would matter.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	I agree with you. Well at least he was given two reigns (short ones) with the title.|`|I4HPyJ0oaa	yeah i agree with u all the way|`|WIiKPQZTaa	he was my favorite all time wrestler back in the early 2000's man, i loved that guy with a passion..i knew when he came back with his hair cut short this was going to be a totally different jericho, and god damnit he was. he was a better heel back in 2003 when would actually wrestle good and not jab his mouth off the whole the time. i think we all miss the funny laughy jokey jericho, that Jericho put the Entertainment in wwE.
ydoIYwGTaa	If Anderson left I think it would be a power struggle of the who's who in the MWD. I think Rich Franklin would be in there in a heart beat trying to retain his title. Hendo is a former champion and could be a good argument he should get a title shot. Personally, as a fan, I would hope they would have a tournament of sorts. Top 8 fighters over a three month span for the title. 4 MW fighters, next month 2 MW fights, third month top 2 fight for the belt.<br>  <br>  I would love to see Gegard Mousasi compete in the UFC. By other two would probably have to be Jorge Santiago and Vitor Belfort.|`|E563RzW2aa	The middleweight division isn't very interesting these days.  Silva has simply been running through everyone so far, and I think he will probably do the same to Leites.  Ironically, if Anderson Silva, probably the most exciting middleweight, left the UFC or retired, I think the MW division would get more competitive and exciting to watch again.  Franklin may step back down if he hasn't made a mark in the LHW division to regain his belt and Hendo probably will stay down in MW.  When the Spider leaves, expect title matches with Hendo, Marquardt and Maia, and maybe Franklin, again depending if he moves back down.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	I would think that Rich Franklin would go to take the belt again. I mean he is a good fighter but as anybody else just can't beat Silva. <br>  <br>  Also I would like to see these people in the ufc I think that they would Make a serious impact.<br>  <br>  1. Fedor Emelianenko<br>  2. Cung lee<br>  3. Vitor Belfort <br>  <br>  Can you imagine that.|`|OURb1rnTaa	hard question. i know dana white hopes silva hangs around for a while. i suspect if he's reading this, he's spitting out his coffee!|`|WEbWVGO7aa	Marquardt is looking to slap the **** out of the division once Silva has had his fill and sets his eyes on the LWM champion, which at that point will likely still be Rashad Evans.|`|k19i61q9aa	Georges St-Pierre|`|9NDL5YQJaa	If Anderson left I think it would be a toss up between Nate Marquardt and Demian Maia.  Both those guys had impressive showings at UFC 95.  Marquardt looks big enough to fight at 205, strong, quick, good striking and wrestling.  Maia's submission skills are insane.  If you go to the ground with him a tapout is coming shortly thereafter.<br>  <br>  Then you have Dan Henderson, Rich Franklin, Leites, Okami.<br>  <br>  Outside the UFC:<br>  1.  Cung Le- problem is he wants to be a movie star.<br>  2.  Robbie Lawler- fierce striker, good sprawl, strong.   Problem is Strikeforce has his rights.<br>  3.  Gegard Mousasi- won the Dream middleweight grand prix.  K-1 level kickboxer, and excellent on the ground.   Mousasi could be the best middleweight in a year or two, but recently said he wanted to fight at HW for some reason.|`|IRNvfdB9aa	In the org: Demian Maia.<br>  <br>  Outside: Matt Lindland, Gegard Mousasi, and Cung Le. <br>  <br>  Honouable mentions: Jacare, Vitor Belfort.<br>  <br>  E
9NDL5YQJaa	I think my interest in the promotion would remain the same.  Soon the WEC will roll all its lightweights into the UFC.  That would leave the WEC with three divisions and a potential women's division.  WEC is a well run promotion, they spend about 350K on fight purses, bring in 500K in ticket sales, and have a tv deal. <br>  <br>  Personally, I think the WEC should add the HW division.  It is the hardest division to find talent, so the UFC should use the WEC to cultivate some of their own talent.  <br>  <br>  If they had HW prospects fighting my interest would go up.|`|OURb1rnTaa	what would increase my interest is if weight classes became uniform, like boxing. welterweight should be 147 lbs, period!|`|YN93QRdyaa	WEC's Welterweight division already has moved to UFC. Carlos Condit fights Martin Kampmann at the next UFC Fight Night. Also the WEC is starting a flyweight division this year. No news on women's division yet though. Really that all depends on where Gina Carano goes, she's the big draw in women's MMA. <br>  <br>  Both organizations still have lightweight divisions, though I suspect WEC's may not be long for this world. No way will the UFC move their lightweights to WEC, not with BJ Penn in that division. Why waste a big drawing fighter in an organization that doesn't run pay-per-views? (Not that BJ would probably put up with such a 'demotion' either). Also the lightweight belt has at least some history in the UFC and the division is strong lately. Whereas the WEC's lightweight division basically doesn't have many notable fighters.<br>  <br>  As for Super Heavyweight, I see no good reason to institute such a division. There are basically no good Super Heavy fighters (at least, none that aren't already fighting at heavyweight).
NnsizqH2aa	It depends on the style, really. More traditional arts may actually use a different belt color system. Only recently did some of the southern style switch to the more popular color system made famous by Japanese and Okinawan arts.<br>  <br>  Modern arts will lean more toward 2 to 4 years for a "black sash", with about to 1-3 years for each rank thereafter. I was in Tien Sun Pai Wu Te Fa for 10 years before I gained my 4th level gold sash (now called 4th black sash), the first level at which you are allowed to be an independent instructor of this art. It took me about 3 years to get my first "black" sash.<br>  <br>  Now, I've seen others progress faster. Our school had 5 different teachers at one time, and some of those teachers gave advanced ranks to select students in an effort to pull those students with them when they broke off to form their own schools. Personally, however, I stayed with TSP because I felt it to be the more complete art. As it was, I was one of the longest-standing students at our school when I was given my highest ranking. Soon thereafter, I went to the military and my old instructor moved to another state. Had it not been for those special circumstances, I likely would not have been ranked to 4th sash when I was. <br>  <br>  So, again, it depends partly on the style and partly on where you are training. In China, you will likely take longer to rank than in the US. In states with fewer schools, it will take longer than those with more schools. This is really the way it should be, since skill and quality of character are always more important than rank.|`|OURb1rnTaa	depends on the school, but don't worry about belts. just get training and knowledge!|`|1NtC3SG0aa	a couple years, depends on how good u r<br>  i started when i was 6 and i got mine's when i was 10 <br>  im 15 now and im a 5th rank black belt<br>  <br>  u hav to work hard for it|`|b0d96knJaa	Hi, dear friend, you may interest in buying martial arts clothes, equipments or weapons <br>  <br>  etc., please go to www.ShoppingEast.com, <br>  they just provide these products from China, cheap and good quality!<br>  <br>  www.ShoppingEast.com

The 590 is a heavy duty tactical, military, police shotgun well suited to combat but is way overkill for the house... It would be wasted money.....  Surely if you want the best buy the 590. On the other hand I have put thousands of rounds thru my Mossberg 500 Persuader and haven't had the slightest of problems....

Everything from light-weight 2 3/4" bird-shot, to 3" magnum rifled slugs.  Never a mis-feed, and the blow-back on the slide after every shot fired makes it seem more like a semi-auto - it does half the work for you when you're loading another round.  I haven't shot a Mossberg 590 to compare, but based on the positive experiences I've had with my own 1300, I would recommend it.<br>  <br>  Both shotguns appear to have a fairly decent after-market following for parts, especially stocks. <br>  <br>  My 1300 fits nicely, and has a favorable balance to it - I use mine with a sling, and it seems to work very nicely.   The day-glo fiberoptic sight that came with mine (snaps onto the front of the barrel) works nicely during the day and in low-light situations.  <br>  <br>  I made the decision to go with Winchester when I got my home-defense shotgun based more on winchester's reputation - but I hope the info is helpful nonetheless!|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Mossberg.  Much more reliable gun.

8MUj24s6aa	Since this is your first gun I would strongly recommend a 9mm. It has way less recoil compared to the .45 and the .40. 9mm ammo is much cheaper than the other two as well. Many police departments still use 9mm around by me. <br>  <br>  Whether you get the XD or the XD(m) I would go with 9mm and then work your way up the latter. <br>  <br>  I will say that the .45 is much more smooth than the .40.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  My first gun was a .40 and I had to trade it in because it was a horrible handgun but I went down to a 9mm because the .40 was just too much to shoot all the time both in recoil and in money. I only had it 4 months.<br>  I own a 9mm and a .45 XD.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Get the XDM-40, i have the xd-40 ( i live in ca) and love it. it is the best of both worlds. Recoil is not bad plus the more you shoot it the less you will feel. It also comes in a few sizes so you can get a small one for concealed carry. I have the tactical because it like the feel of a big gun in my hands. But if i had to choose between a 9mm or .45 i would go with the .45. However ammo is cheaper for the 9mm.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	I don't own an XD but I have shot a number of them.  I would get the 9mm first.  Ammo price is much less and you can practice more.  <br>  <br>  The 45 is nice, but you're going to spend a fortune on ammo.  You'll be lucky to get a box of 50 for $16.  The 9mm is around $10.  Jacketed hollow points are even more.  <br>  <br>  Sure, the 45 has more stopping power but it's more important to consider where you hit the assailant.  No use having a 45 if you can't hit what you're shooting at.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I carry the 9mm most of the time.  I have the Smith & Wesson in both full and compact sizes.  When I go with the full, I carry 17 + 1 in the pipe with 2 extra magazines (because magazines fail, not because I want to carry a lot of ammo).  I have the M&P 45 but I have yet to qualify with it.|`|AA12243350	The Springfield XD is a great pistol. My wife carries the XD compact in .45acp for her CCW pistol. I tested it extensively and it passed with flying colors.<br>  My first chice is .45acp, second choice is .40S&W<br>  and last choice is 9mm.<br>  for self defense you just can't beat the performance of a .45. the .40S&W also performs very very well, with a little less recoil.<br>  The 9mm will work.<br>   I have seen first hand the results of hits with all 3 calibers.<br>  the .45 ends fights right now.<br>  the .40 is very very good.<br>  I have yet to see a one shot stop with a 9mm. But have seen people take multiple hits from one and still have time to shoot back.<br>  In the end, you should try shooting the different calibers to see what you like, and can shoot with the most accuracy. In a gunfight, I want the odds stacked in my favor, so I shoot the .45acp.<br>  shoot safe|`|bjuVcxN8aa	I'm in the same situation. I really liked the look of the XD's especially the XDm. <br>  <br>  I have also looked at the taurus 1911. Heard some bad reviews from them in the past, but they seem to be making better guns. And the blue steel ones look pretty cool. Right now i'm looking at a Springfield 1911. <br>  <br>  Sorry don't have too much for your answer. Also, you should be able to handle the recoil fine. Unless you're 13. Then you might have trouble. :)|`|GmRscBkPaa	For you first gun, get a used XD9.  9mm ammo is cheaper, recoil is less, and a used gun will save you some bucks while you learn how to shoot safely and accurately.  <br>  <br>  Because the money you save now, will be spent on a brand new .45 later.  Trust me.|`|2gWJjIEfaa	Ive owned both. I like 9mm personally, there alot cheaper to shoot and with some of the hollow points on the market today stoping power isn't an issue. The XDM is the way to go if you can afford it.|`|AA12211483	I've been struggling with the same question and I believe I'm gonna go with the XD-m in 9mm.  If I still want a .45acp later I'll save up and get a nice 1911.
OURb1rnTaa	how are you taking the test without knowing those? did they not go over them in preparation for the class? i studied kenpo also, but it's hard to say becasuse there are still differences in the styles. get together early with someone else in your class and go over some stuff today. you might pass without knowing those, but i don't know anything about your school. also, check youtube and the internet for some basic moves, jot them on paper, and go over them in your mind for the rest of the day! good luck!

poc3xrCeaa	As the WWE has change its target audience and is now PG i doubt we will see the harcord title again which is a shame i used to love the 24/7 rule brought in by crash holly|`|4YcZv0d7aa	Like others, I would like to see the Harcore Title come back. For safety reasons and to keep it more PG, I think they shouldn't have it 24/7. Instead, make bigger and more spectacular matches. What's the big deal about seeing a match go on with as much violence as in a regular match. Is it PG when Triple H uses his sledgehammer or when the Dudley Boys would use a table all the time. I think a Hardcore match isn't as hellacious as the infamous TLC match.<br>  <br>  I could see them bringing back the Cruiserweight title first. The wrestlers that are leaving TNA could be picked up by WWE and since they are smaller wrestlers, they could bring it back. If they brought it back they could put it on ECW to even out the titles. If they did that, they could create a unified tag-team championship and make it a floating championship. That means it would go from show to show, wherever the wrestlers are.<br>  <br>  Like always, its just my thought.|`|Q7U2HaYdaa	Nope, hardcore title might be to much for the lil kids<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a><br>  it never lets me down and it always shows High Quality and HD streams and plus it never lags with the amount of people!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> Also it shows RAW, Smackdown, ECW, TNA, ROH, Boxing, UFC!!<br>  <a href="http://freesportsnetwork.net/" rel="nofollow">http://freesportsnetwork.net/</a> !!!!!!!!!!!|`|BglekVnQaa	It's the PG era now which means less blood and violence, so I really don't see them bringing it back. Also how can you bring back the harcore title without the hardcore legend Mick Foley?|`|AA10309775	probably not. they originally got rid of it because too many guys were getting hurt. and because wwe is becoming more family-freindly don't count on it anytime soon.|`|lJ3icYSKaa	no|`|InX5Pfl5aa	They wont bring the hardcore title the attude era is over... get over it :/.<br>  <br>  Now they should bring back the cruiser weight title...|`|bLhTwPqIaa	I think they should as well, but in this day it is never gonna happen I'm afraid. They may do something similar one day having a Title which is 24/7 which would be like a new version of The WWE TV Title, but it would not be in Extreme Rules. But you never know. It would be nice.

U1lmbP7kaa	When you worry about dropping the ball, your gonna drop the ball.<br>  You need to work on your mental aspect of the game.|`|Zymxhc7Jaa	You are thinking too much, putting way too much pressure on yourself. Just chill out|`|AA12022123	just act like your playing at home with your friends and dont think about anything but catching the ball dont try to hard cuz thats when you mess up, go out there do your thing|`|Cn7rXPimaa	ok first of all its probably not your skills that are bad, it might be more of a mental thing. You might be trying too hard don't think about it and just do what you would normally do even if it wasnt a game. I know hockey and football are two different sports but forever in a game my slap shot sucked. So i just decided to calm down and do what i do in practice. If u are still having trouble, try practicing in game situations. Also don't think about getting hit if thats your problem|`|MbcvI1A9aa	i had the same problem when i played tight end. ur thinking 2 much. i was nervous and thinking about how bad im going to look if i dont catch the ball. i was thinking i wouldnt catch it while i was running when the ball was in mid-air. believe in ur hands. watch the ball in the air the whole time and think about nothing else. if u concentrate on the ball and have good hands u should catch the ball 90% of the time.|`|l3y23yVcaa	Sounds like you're thinking WAY too much... perhaps if you chill out and relax a bit and let the game flow to you... it'll come...|`|1613506c4d9c8e75054ffdcc3607c11daa	Yo I played at WVU for 3 years at Tight end and i can tell you exactly what your problem is. It is confidence. If you have confidence you will catch that ball. U need to focus. U need to want to catch the ball and want to score. Everytime I caught a pass I just knew I would score. And if I didnt then it made me work harder everytime. I never got complacent when i started doing well because i alwasys set my gaols beyond my ability so I stayed focused. And practice makes perfect. I made my quarterback my best friend and we were out running routes and throwing the ball everyday. In the gym or out on the grass. There are many different drills that will make it so catching is second nature.|`|zAQI22sMaa	i always felt more comfortable playing baseball in my backyard. it was what i had done my whole life. when i got into a game, it felt weird and different. think i had become so used to the game while wearing a torn shirt, shorts and regular shoes, that when i tried to play with all the attire and helmet, it felt too weird to do anything. <br>  maybe ur just not as comfortable with the game as when youre playing with ur boys in the backyard?|`|vuxef3O4aa	Your not having fun in the game, Just have fun, don't think to mach, just play on Instinct, memorize all the plays and when your at home sit down some were quite and  play the game in you mind. at school take 10 minute to play the games in you mind before going out there|`|qExNjtTqaa	i often had the same problem<br>  u haft to work hard at catching with ur qb outside of school/practice<br>  also get stronger in ur arms, it will help u catch and cradle the ball<br>  hit the benchpress|`|h1XOY41Faa	i agree maybe its your nerves..... but ask coach to run some drills wit you after practice. it will help you and show ur coach that your dedicated.|`|SHRKIJxkaa	idk maybe it's nerves|`|G2OdDlmjaa	stop thinking act like you are with your friends and relax|`|u3JjH9azaa	maybe your friends suck and the qb doesnt|`|mMhgmMKqaa	do u wear any gloves when u play? If u do when you play for school ad dot when ur with ur friends then dot wear them. it might also be the helmet messing up you concentration.

6tGYe5roaa	Because many people from Philly are relentless. Booing and hating on players comes pretty natural to them. They desperately want a Super Bowl and every year they do not get one, they get more and more frustrated. I guess it is just easy to lay blame on the QB.

8t5vPDnqaa	At the top of their career, Sakic is better than Heatley.  At the end of their career, Sakic is also better than Heatley.  Right at this moment in time, Heatley is better than Sakic simply because he's 10 years younger.|`|zMSdChKgaa	Joe Sakic is way better. He has more goals, assists, and points. He also has 2 Stanley Cups. Not to mention the best wrist shot in the league.|`|YajYjjxLaa	When Sakic was in his prime, Sakic.

oqQjnpfGaa	Bottom Line: Yes, do this trade. <br>  <br>  Personally I really like Chris Bosh's game even though he is playing through some injuries right now. Melo is a high risk (high reward player) but he is quite hot lately, so you might be able to trade for a better player than Bosh right now. <br>  <br>  Since you have a good sf, Bosh should be able to pick up his game in the next few weeks. <br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Do it.|`|p8A6oN2Faa	It seems to me that Bosh is what you need and Melo isnt so I would do the trade.

If you are certain you have to fight here is what to do:<br>  <br>   This honestly works but is seen as a bit dirty - Ask him a question, something like Do you know the time or something that will get him to think, even for a second. There is this thing called the 3 second fight. It is a technique muggers and rapists etc use. There are these things called the zones, like in White and in Red. If you ask him a question like that, He will hopefully be close to white, which is like unaware. Then you have to attack as quick and hard as you can. A punch to the side of the head. Withdraw your hand quickly and punch him in the guts hard. Then kick him in the shins. Do like a football kick, nothing fancy is required. Then try to push him over which will be easy by this stage. Try putting your foot behind his and then push him over. When on the floor, kick him in the guts and threaten more. You will need to get him scared ***less.  Remember, you have to do this quickly, so i suggest you practice a bit. <br>  <br>  Good luck mate|`|vyGyLV7paa	i know a guy who was in the UFC and he always told me that if you are ever in a fight with someone who is bigger than you (outside of a boxing ring) it is OK to play dirty.  if i were u id bring a bat or heavy pole, that way neither of you will want to hit the other one.  also, you shouldn't go alone, because if you do start a fist fight, chances are the bigger guy will win.  try bringing you toughest/biggest friend to help or someone a lot older than you like a senior in high school that you know (even nerds in high school are a lot stronger than you and i, i am 13 too)  if you skateboard, getting hit with a board hurts a lot too.|`|W8v86HYoaa	I could tell you some simple techniques but I'm not sure if I should<br>  Don't use complex fighting moves - you're too young to carry them off sucessfully<br>  I had a simular situation when I was a kid, except I was a girl. I managed to get the guy in a pretty bad state<br>  ignore the chest - go for the face and legs. A quick way is to use a finger jab into their eyes. they will be distracted, and kick out at their legs. you can hurt the guy further by placing your hand under his chin and shoving so that their neck bends backwards - but this move is very dangerous so I don't reccomend it. These moves will give you time to decide if you want to escape or fight, and should show that you know what you're doing<br>  also tell your parents and the police in case anyting happens. If you reported it previously, it will look like you're telling the truth if you report it afterwards, and your side of the story will be taken into more consideration.

brxKFT1Laa	mmm,<br>  Personally i think swimming is great!<br>  sometimes people worry way to much about things that arent really that bad.<br>  i know how you feel tho cuz i was like that too before i started swiming competitively.<br>  Anyways i say Swim, youll love it!<br>  its relaxing and nice, and better then running miles and being covered in sweat..<br>  <br>  As far as privacy,<br>  What you do is change inside a towel, thast how swim team people do it.<br>  You hold your towel over your body. like wrap it around your body<br>  Then you take off your clothes underneath it and put the suit on your body while the towel is still completly covering you. Then you changed wihtout revealing nething at all! put some lights shorts and a tshirt on over if you dont wanna just wear a swim suit until you get to the water from the lockerroom. but your suit hides things pretty well, depending on the suit<br>  <br>  The physical aspect, swimming isnt that hard. its mostly technique if your not swimming competitions. And everyone is always bad unles they swim for a team. Plus P.E. its not like a team where you need to be good! Just have a good time and try and do whatever they ask!<br>  <br>  Oh and the smell, well no real way around that, just take something that smells good, take soap that you like and take a shower with it, With your suit on... for your privacy...<br>  <br>  Your hair,<br>  Wel put a cap on before you get in the pool, if you get a tight cap, it will barely let ne water in, ive seen girls swim competitions without even getting there hair wet.!<br>  but im sure it wouldnt be that bad if your hair got wet, it might even be a nice change of pace!<br>  <br>  As for the doctor's note, i mean if you really think its that bad...<br>  but honestly its not as bad as you think...<br>  Good luck!|`|pWz8d8MBaa	Go to a different school only a few more months of school left so you wont miss ur friends to bad graduating is important and it looks to me like ur not changing ur mind, also everyone has to do this, just stand next to the fat guy in the  locker room and ull look great!!! or change in a bathrroom its more common than you think while everyone is changing go  look at the bathrooms trust me theres people who do it and no one will no change super fast so then u can immmediatly go into the pool so then no one will see u if there is someone in ur 2nd period that ur worried will seeu change periods and ask ur counselor to see the class lits when ur changing, there nice about it and will let u look,, another good option would be to change it to ur last period of the day so u have extra time to avoid everyone in the locker rooms.<br>  <br>  also the docter is going to want a physical problem and proff of a physical poblem of why you cant swim so dont.<br>  <br>  if u have a nice counselor at ur school u can getout of it super easy tell them this:<br>  i dont know how to swim and im terribly afraid of the water and try to completly avoid it when i was little i drowned in a lake and ever science then i cant go in it!!!!!!    hope i helped and good luck on getting out of iit|`|2umKyYEaaa	Suck it up, it's a part of life. Also, you question isn't so much swim-related as it is moral and ethics. I'm a swimmer, I love the smell of chlorine, don't mind having dry skin for a few hours and have no problems showing my body. If you're afraid of getting in a pool, how do you expect to live normally in a society?|`|q549d4Obaa	wow|`|yk6Kg0aOaa	Budy you are a stupid idiot swimming is good excerise. You need to know some basics on swimming for in an emergency somethig could happen to someone you know and there is no one else around to help them and if you don't do anything to try and help you could be held accountable for for thier death if you did not do anything. An accident can happen at anytime.<br>  Say for instance that you are driving down a hill and you loose your breaks on your car and you wind up loosing control of you car and it go into a large body of water your car sinks you oly have a few seconds to get out of the car swim upto the surface to save yourself and if you don't know how to swim I guess you will drown and die. So I say just suck it up and take the swimming lessons. I took some a few years back during the one Summer  and I didn't want to take them either and I just sucked it up and took them and it was one of the most enlightening experiences that I have ever had amd now that I took them I could probably be able to save my self if I wound up in an emergency and had to. Or if one of my friends or neighbors or girl friend wound up in trouble in a private swimming pool I would be able to get in and save them if I had to. So again I say just get your f****** head out of your f****** *** and just take the swimming lessons it might be one of the most enlightening experiences that you will ever have other than sex and marriage.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Increase your vertical leap. You will need the lifting power of your legs to get you in the air and up to the basket. Plyometrics are the best (and often fastest) ways to get results. Doing squats, or if you don't have weights, wall sits, also help you gain those inches. Something that also helps is having strong abdominal muscles(Abdominals have little or no effect on jumping. They are stabilizers and do not help with movement[1]). Increasing your height will take time, though, so stick with it. <br>  Muscle groups that need to be stronger: Quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, calves. The quadriceps extend the knee. The hamstrings and gluteals extend the hip. The calves plantar flex the ankle. <br>  Muscle groups that need flexibility: Hamstrings and hip flexors. Tight hamstrings will impede the knee extension during the jump. Hip flexors resist the hip extension part of the jump. <br>  Running stairs will develop the quadriceps, hips, and calves. <br>  Invest in a good pair of shoes. Most players find that high-quality shoes improve their ability to dunk, and more importantly, prevent you from getting hurt when you try to dunk. <br>  Practice jumping at the court.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jump across the whole court and back. Try two laps or more. <br>  Jump to touch the net with a running jump until you are able to do it ten times in a row (not all in one day!). <br>  Progress to the goal of touching the backboard, again until you can do it ten times comfortably. <br>  Set your sights on the rim until you can touch it consistently. <br>  Practice handling the ball. Get a feel for how to use inertia to control the ball when your arm is extended. Even people who can palm a basketball will lose grip when dunking. <br>   <br>  Start with an adjustable height basket, if you have access to one. Lower the height so you can get a feel for dunking, then raise it gradually to the standard height as you improve. <br>   <br>  Dribble toward the basket, then take the allowed two steps while palming the ball in your dunking hand. Jump as high as you can after your second step, extend your arm to the rim, and drive the ball through the net.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most people jump off of one foot, but some people find that they jump higher off of two. Find what works for you. <br>  Dunk a tennis ball or golf ball first, then a volleyball, and work your way up to a basketball. <br>   <br>  Dunk one-handed first. It helps to find a small sized Basketball to train with. It takes a lot more effort to touch the rim with two hands, because you must jump high enough that both reach the rim. After that, you can progress to the reverse dunk. <br>  The ball may come back and hit you in the face. Be prepared for it. Fear of getting hit will negatively affect your ability to dunk. <br>  Let go of the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you. <br>  Be persistent. You'll likely embarrass yourself during your first several attempts to dunk, but get up off the floor and try again. You'll be impressed at your improvement if you keep going. <br>  Do backboard touches for 2 minutes|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Squats and Situps.|`|uoIV59V6aa	first u jump then u put the ball in to the basket then u grab to the basket and that a slam dunk

It depends on what you want to do and your skates.<br>  <br>  For plain recreation, I have seen people around 300 lbs skating.  I have also seen a person who was probably a little under 200 with discount store skates where the cheap plastic mounting for the front wheel broke.<br>  <br>  I really don't recommend discount store skates because they tend to be quite poor quality.<br>  <br>  If you are much over 200 lbs, I would suggest getting better than average skates because they come with stiffer (and more durable) frames.  Stamped aluminum frames are better than any of the plastic ones and extruded aluminum are the best.<br>  For heavy people, I would generally recommend against getting the 100mm wheels.  They will put more side forces on your ankles.<br>  <br>  If you want to do aggressive skating or other jumping activities, you will need to pay even more attention to the quality and strength of the skates.

jY6cis4Kaa	Hopkins would win by decision... one that maybe closer than what many may expect. Hopkins would take full advantage of his natural size over Mayweather, who would not be use to fighting at middleweight. Mayweather would fall short just like Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad. Despite thinking Floyd would lose, I think he would look better against Hopkins than what Trinidad and De La Hoya did, because of his natural ability and skill.|`|dh48AkbCaa	in their primes, mayweather was no middleweight, and mayweather winning titles starting at jr lightweight, would not stand a chance against hopkins.<br>  <br>  mayweather is faster and more skilled pound for pound, but is too small for b-hop, and even if he wasn't, his brittle hands would not stand up.|`|oia4i0qCaa	Mayweather, honestly he always finds a way to win.

That is why most basketball players nowadays are aiming to get the perfect dunking skills for them to be able to show off or flaunt.<br>  <br>  However, doing such or attaining such a skill, requires a lot of discipline. That is because to be able to dunk better, the basketball player has to improve and work out his larger muscle group - the legs.<br>  <br>  Jumping<br>  <br>  It is very elementary. The knowledge that jumping requires agility and strength of the leg muscle group is a basic and very apparent and logical.<br>  <br>  Jumping requires applying force to the feet, and to be able to jump higher, more force is needed.<br>  <br>  That is why to be able to jump higher and dunk a basketball better, here are some useful tips that can be of great help to you, the basketball player.<br>  <br>  1) Do leg exercises<br>  <br>  There are a number of leg exercises. The good thing about it is that these exercises can be done even outside the gym. These exercises can be very simple and can be performed even if you are just standing in the bus terminal, waiting for the next ride.<br>  <br>  a. Stand firmly on the ground. Then stand on your toes, down to the ground, and do the procedure repeatedly.<br>  <br>  b. Jump up and down. It does not necessarily be higher.<br>  <br>  c. Jog round if you have time. Jogging is not just a good leg exercise but also an effective cardiovascular activity.<br>  <br>  d. Jump using a jumping rope.<br>  <br>  e. Stretch your leg muscles every now and the. It does not only relaxes you but also improve the circulation in that muscle group.<br>  <br>  2) Wear the best shoes when playing the game<br>  <br>  There are good shoes out in the market nowadays that are very comfortable and ideal for basketball games. Basketball shoes currently are considered necessities in the lives of basketball players.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, shoes add up to their confidence, which in turn boost agility, inspiration and then, performance. Imagine having a dunk, people will be staring at your shoes, so prepare for the occasion and wear the best shoes. Your shoes tell stories about you, don’t you think?<br>  <br>  Overall, jumping higher to dunk a basketball depends on your mood during the play. Open up your mind, be happy and relaxed while playing the game.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Practice jumping.|`|Hvhynlftaa	Lmao.....<br>  <br>  When I was grade 9 I can Touch the rim.

0uONmqYCaa	According to Baseball Prospectus, Nationals Park in 2008 had a park factor of 1.030, meaning it was 3% more favorable to hitters than the average major league ballpark.  The park factor for Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati was about the same, so I expect that Dunn will hit about the same number of homers as he usually does (40).|`|KTp27Fokaa	I don't think it's either of them. It's certainly easier to hit homeruns than it was in RFK Stadium (the Nationals former stadium), but it is pretty deep out there. It's a little closer to a pitcher's park than a hitters park.<br>  <br>  The Reds stadium (sorry, forgot the name), is the biggest hitters park in the MLB. I think Dunn's homeruns will go down, because right field is pretty deep in Nationals Park, and Dunn hits all his homeruns the right field. <br>  <br>  I think he hits 35 homeruns|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	It generally plays "neutral" although by today's standards it would probably be considered a "pitcher's park."  It has larger OF dimensions than most of the "new" parks like Cincy and Philly, especially in the gaps...If I remember, Dunn seems more like a dead "pull" hitter, so the bigger gaps won't hurt him.  In fact, it could lead to more doubles for him.|`|q0xFtWt4aa	Certainly is not a winninig park! I am joking but I think certain aspects of it favor the pithcer......I think Adam Dunn does not care where he hits!|`|P93LdoDPaa	I wouldn't say so, Nationals Park is very friendly to the pitcher in my opinion.|`|AA10987824	Who knows, no one's ever actually be inside it before...no baseball has ever been played there...

But if i was an Eagle's Fan I would want TJ Housemonzzilla(i know that not how u spell it) than Marvin...<br>  He just isnt the player he used 2 be. He has lost atleast a step or 2.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	well the only real reason would be to help rookies like jackson or if they draft a new WR but i wont expect them to get him|`|WqI4cmoSaa	hopefuly not hes got about a year or two left on him t.j is the better bet|`|nkaJ0t5Vaa	NO!!!! he will be a free agent or play for the colts|`|ubGNtkHQaa	How are the Eagles better than the Colts!?!?!?!?!?!?!?|`|4kdlE54Paa	To be honest with you, I am not keen on Marvin Harrison becoming a 49er.  He is just up there in age and spiralling down in his career due to prior injuries.  We need to think future rather that patch work with an aging WR on the downslope of his career.  We already tried that when we picked up Darrell Jackson in the 2007 season.  Tell me that wasn't a bust.  Similar to what happened with D Jax can easily happen to Marvin Harrison.  <br>  <br>  In my eyes, I would be far more content if the 49ers were aggressive in picking up TJ Houshmandzadeh even though the WR core is not the immediate need for the team.  I consider Isaac Bruce, Josh Morgan, Jason Hill and Arnaz Battle good enough right now for the run first type of offense that Mike Singletary wants to implement.  The immediate needs for the 49ers right now is an O line, Pass Rusher, and a Safety.  Those are our biggest weeknesses that are stopping us from being a strong playoff contender.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|e4ekb1amaa	The Eagles already have 6 WR's who would be great #2 - 4 receivers on any team (Curtis, Jackson, Avant, Brown, Lewis, Basket).... they most certainly don't need a 7th.<br>  <br>  He will not be signed by Philadelphia this year, especially not with other, much better options available. If the Eagles get anyone, its going to be Hoosh or Boldin.|`|uU9aCPB4aa	he could be good for the eagles for a year or two, but then he would probably retire. if the eagles get harrison they will win the superbowl so watch out. <br>  <br>  Donovan McNabb + Marvin Harrison = Superbowl ring<br>  <br>  <br>  actually yeah Houshamdzadeh is better he's younger and got more years left in him. Great hands too so ................<br>  <br>  Donovan McNabb + TJ Houshmandzadeh = Superbowl ring|`|ftP6mhuvaa	Harrison isn't what he was. Injuries killed him.

LeBron literally carries the Cavs himself and has nowhere near the amount of talent that Kobe has with the Lakers.  If Kobe went down I can see Odom, Gasol, a healthy Bynum, and that bench getting wins.  They obviously wont be as good but I think they could still make the playoffs. If the Cavs lost LeBron they could still win games to but they really have nobody like an Odom or an Ariza or someone athletic like that to pick up some of the scoring load. Neither LeBron nor Kobe are ball hogs they are the 2 greatest players in the game right now but for this season as of now I have to give the MVP to LeBron James.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Sure he deserves to be MVP. He has taken a mediocre Cavs team and turned them into an Elite team with the only addition of Williams.<br>  <br>  But, you can't forget about Kobe, Howard, CP3, and Wade.

ALL THE WAY|`|F65Km3Coaa	lebron for mvp|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	LBJ deserves to be MVP. LeBron James is a better leader than Kobe. PERIOD. LBJ single-handedly carried a  team before in the NBA Finals. It reminds me of a young Steve Nash that made his PHX team improve and became one of the top playoff contender, and he was MVP back-to-back because of that. You don't have to be a stat-leader to become a MVP, you have to be a great leader and push yourself to the limit to be a better player and make your teammates contribute too. KB24 had a lot of superstar around his team, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and a very good coach Phil Jackson but because of his attitude they didn't got the ring.|`|a8yDDprlaa	As of now,my pick for mvp is Lebron James.He is having a fantastic season.The addition of Mo Williams certainly helped but Lebron also stepped up his game.However, If the Lakers get the number 1 seed in the playoffs, it must be Kobe.It would be the second year in a row that he led his team to a #1 seed, without their starting center,Andrew Bynum.|`|HiuNSScLaa	wade is mvp if he isnt then its lebron then kobe kobe shoudnt even be in the conversation just because kobe is probably the best player doesnt mean he gets mvp every year laker fans stop being stubborn its lebron and wades fight so far and bringing the worst team in the nba to 5th seed in the east is by far better than bringing something to a bigger something|`|NALuet7Zaa	Dude, you can make a thousand points and I wouldnt care... you lost the game...

Kobe shouldnt even be in the discussion now... Last year he won the mvp award because lebron had a bad record standing at 4th best in the EAst... now that the cleveland are top in the east, Kobe winning the mvp is what you can erase already in ur laker loving heart, because u'll all be depressed when kobe is not named mvp, Lebron will..

American football is based around the concept of moving the ball toward your opponents goal-line.  The ball is kicked off to start the game.  Let's say the opponent kicked off to you and your runner was tackled in the field.  Then, you get the ball, you line your eleven guys up against your opponents eleven guys and try to move the ball and you have 4 downs to move 10 yards toward the opponents goal-line.  If you do not make it 10 yards in the first three downs, you have to punt the ball back to your opponent on fourth down, except if you are close to the opponents goal-line.  Then you can try to score a touchdown (7 points with an extra point) or kick the ball between the uprights for a field goal (3 points).  You then kickoff to your opponent and he will try to move the ball 10 yards within 4 downs toward your goal-line.  <br>  <br>  You also have fumbles (losing the ball before a player with the ball is down on the ground) and interceptions (catching a pass that your opponent tried to throw to one of their teamates).<br>  <br>  After fumbles and interceptions the team recovering the ball gets to start their progress toward their opponents goals line same as after kickoffs.  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	Watch the games & if there is something you don't understand ask somebody who would be willing to help.

Two seasons before they got Magic and won their first championship.<br>  <br>  Plus I'm from LA. I pull for the local teams.|`|ASeS1Jo8aa	i hate the lakers because their loser kobe can't stop crying and the whole team ain't going nowhere because the whole team solf|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Don't know|`|j0119zipaa	Well, mostly because there are so many Laker lovers out there, and I like to go for the under dog!  Plus the attitude of just about everyone of their players -- except for Derek Fisher -- just bugs me.  They act like they are "privileged".   <br>  <br>  Plus I grew up watching the Jazz..since I was at least 6 or 7...so home town loyalty!  Nothing wrong with that, since you seem to have the same mind set!<br>  <br>  But just so I'm clear, if I hadn't grown up watching the Jazz, I'd still be a Laker Hater.<br>  <br>  By the way, I was at the last Laker vs. Jazz game..you know the one where the Jazz won?  That was fun!|`|i5MInqeMaa	I lived in L.A. briefly during the Magic Years and post magic years.  I left before the kobe and shaq era, but was absolutely disgusted with the bandwagon fans they have in L.A.  You should of seen what it was like when the laker were not that bad of a team, but how lots of fans jumped off after the showtime team retired.  The fans leave early and arrive late to the games, and are more hollywood than real NBA fans.  It's increased 10x that since the kobe days.  I hate the Laker fans more than I hate the lakers, but I hate the Lakers cause i hate their fans.  I've hated the Lakers since the mid 90's.<br>  <br>  My buddy has season tickets and i catch a few laker games every year when i come down to visit and it's just to hollywood.  If you wanna see real fans go to a Utah, Detroit, San Antonia game.<br>  <br>  I lived in multiple NBA cities and I have been in nosebleeds and courtside and L.A is mostly filled with people that just wanna be seen.  I also been up in the nosebleeds and those fans disappeared after magic left so dont' give the real fan crap.  I know cause i was there.  Staples centered is packed everynight, but i guarantee you that if the Lakers were a 500 team there would barely be anybody there.  Thats a fact.<br>  <br>  YOu could go up to about the average laker fan at staples and they couldn't even name you the bench players.  Lots of them didn't even know that farmar was out several weeks with a knee injury.  LMFAO.|`|0TAld46gaa	The best team did struggle against minnesota<br>  <br>  but they best team did beat the Celtics at home<br>  beat Cavs at home and never truly been at full strength all yr

Vep76FT9aa	wade he is trhe best player since mj|`|bQqkdPL9aa	Since Kobe won it last year I think the voters are gonna vote for LeBron. And he truly does deserve it. Just look and his and numbers and how the team is responding to him. And their record is pretty sick. But who knows...|`|KydnrU5raa	it is definitely kobe or lebron. They are the top 2 teams and are most likely going to go to the finals. Lebron continues to play consistently and well, but kobe is doing that too. it all depends how well their teams do in the playoffs|`|Tt3aZltJaa	Kobe and LeBron are the most likely candidates. I would say at this juncture Kobe is leading because he has the Lakers with the best record in the NBA and has beat LeBron head to head twice.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Wade|`|mwxKnUleaa	Yeah I really think it's going to be Lebron he has put up great numbers and has a great record there in Cleveland. Just like last year I think Lebron is going to get the benefit of the doubt and get some votes because he has never won the award. In the end I think he is very deserving of the award|`|vzH7f7V5aa	LeBron.|`|E1nWrW61aa	Dwight Howard deserves it.  Leads the league in rebounds and blocks.  Delivers a double-double just about every game.  Lebron is in the mix too I would say.  <br>  <br>  A lot of people would say Kobe also, but to me, he's just a scoring machine.  Scoring is important, but there is more to the game than just scoring.<br>  <br>  Go Magic!|`|kFcdwVwdaa	its definetly who between kobe and LBJ. but the guy who said it depends on the playoffs, it doesn't.

KG is hurt and Lebron can't win a playoff series by himself. He needs more help.
Vep76FT9aa	ta|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	"Hall of Famer" implies that he is in the Hall of Fame, so no. He is not a Hall of Famer.<br>  <br>  Could he be one? Maybe. He's still got a few years a head of him to make or break his career.|`|AA11051192	He has potential, but if he was to retire today, then no.<br>  <br>  He has had a very successful last 10 or 11 years int he NFL and maybe if he can put up another 6 or 7 years of 1000+ yard receiving seasons then he has a shot|`|5B6w8mxVaa	no. great all around receiver yes. Hall of famer no.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	I HATE ward but i got to admit he might make it to the hall of fame.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	I agree with most people here, it all depends how he does the next couple of years.|`|9Dv4GBHYaa	yes how couldent he be. every single nfl mvp for the super bowl has been in the hall of fame|`|lpiMi3s3aa	not quite....its questionable dpends how he does next few yrs|`|ZLvdy5nBaa	Yes!!|`|9Vrrj0otaa	maybe on the way. but not yet|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	yes|`|q0xFtWt4aa	yes!!!|`|ZWkX43zMaa	Yes he is. I mean, it is pretty good if you're the best receiver in Pittsburgh Steelers history stats wise. He has more career receptions, yards, and touchdowns than Lynn Swann and John Stallworth. Now that's saying something.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	No.|`|4kdlE54Paa	He is on pace for consideration, but still needs more years to be a serious contender.  The only thing that hurts him is his statistics.  He does not have many seasons over a thousand yards receiving.  He has 5 seasons over 1K in receiving in his 11 season career with the other ones being mediocre at best.<br>  <br>  What seperates Hines Ward from other WRs is his all around ability as a WR.  He can do everything with above average ability.  He is very physical and blocks extremely well.  On top of that, he plays with a permanant smile on his face.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Hines Ward is my top hated player in the NFL but look at Swanns numbers and Swann is in.  Ward blows him away. Indeed he is.  He is an excellent WR.  Swann was simply on a good team, thats exactly why he is in the HOF. <br>  <br>  Lynn Swann CAREER stats<br>  5,462 receiving yards<br>  336 receptions<br>  51 tds<br>  <br>  Hines Ward career stats<br>  9780 receiving yards<br>  800 receptions<br>  72 tds|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He might have a shot.  I mean, at first I was thinking absolutely not, because you really don't hear about him as much as guys like Harrison, T.O., Moss, etc, but if you look at his stats, they're actually fairly good.  Also consider he's never had a good QB like some of the other WRs (no, Ben is NOT good), his numbers are actually even more impressive.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	We will have to wait and see how the rest of his career unfolds before we can say Ward is a Hall of Fame player.|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	He has been under the radar of the 1998 rookie class that has sported names like Peyton Manning and Randy Moss.  In his eleven seasons, he has amassed nearly 10,000 yards and 72 TDs.  For a man of his physical stature, he has continually made himself a dominating name in the NFL at the wide receiver position.  His impact on the team reverberates even more so than Roethlisberger and Parker.  Hines Ward can be seen as the heart of the team and a true leader on and off the field.<br>  <br>  Beyond the stats and rings, Ward epitomizes what it means to be a Steeler.  When he retires and his name pops up on the ballot, he will not only be in the hall of fame, but look for him to be selected for entry on his first shot.<br>  <br>  Side Note:  if you are just examining stats as the basis for entry into the Hall of Fame, then why is Joe Namath there?  His stats are horrible, yet he was elected.|`|cdQryr7paa	My first instinct to this question was to say no.<br>  But looking at his stats, it seems that he could be considered for the Hall of Fame.<br>  However, he did not get 1,000 yards receiving until his 4th year in the league (2001).<br>  So, he didn't make an immediate impact on his team like most Hall of Fame players do.<br>  But, over the last 8 years of his career, he has easily averaged 1,000 yards per season and collected 2 Super Bowl rings.<br>  So, at this point he could be considered to have accumulated the kind of numbers needed to enter the hall.<br>  I do believe what he does in the next couple years will also be taken into consideration.<br>  I look for him to be inducted, but by no means the first year he is eligible.<br>  He may have to wait 2, 3, or more years after he is eligible before it actually happens.<br>  He is alot like Rod Smith from the Broncos was. He produces, but you don't really hear about him too much.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	yes. he is on a running team first so his stats arnt packed. he is one of the best WR blockers in the game, MVP of superbowl 40,  i wonder what his catching % is, because he catches everything. a few more good years and he should be in. 2 superbowls won.|`|ABoo1doVaa	If Swan is, then Ward should be.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I think he is and will be, one day.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	yes he is amazing!!!|`|scdOQ2CAaa	NOPE<br>  LOL|`|xxtvhn5Naa	NO!
Vep76FT9aa	no|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	I don't see any vast improvement with the Raiders.<br>  <br>  Offensive unit issues are still present.  Their offensive line is questionable.  The QB situation is weak, as is the WR position.  The RB by committee is still in flux, with the team still trying to fit McFadden into the whole fray.  <br>  <br>  Defensively, they are improving, but still lack the rush defense to help contain opponents.  This is huge in their division since San Diego and Denver are RB forces, and Kansas City is looking to return to the run scheme in full force.  The pass defense is fair with Asomugha being a solid defensive back, but nothing else stands out to help him.  If they face a halfway decent QB, the Raiders will get passed on without much effort.  <br>  <br>  The Raiders need to fix their defense if they want to stay in the game.  Most likely, they will draft a solid DE to boost their defensive line.  Also, they might hit the free agency market and snag a WR or two that could give them a chance to stretch the opposing defense (Houshmadzadeh could go silver and black, who knows?).<br>  <br>  Still, this will be another dismal year for Oakland.  Do not expect much from them for another couple of seasons before they get their act together with this current bunch . . . and BETTER COACHING.<br>  <br>  Also, someone please get rid of Al Davis.  He has been the singlemost biggest cause for all the recent issues to hit the Raiders.|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	They looked good the last 4 or 5 weeks of the season and play in weak division.  So its possible, but I think they will probably go 7-9 if JaMarcus Russell can improve.|`|3b909qhqaa	I doubt it, their line-up is all wrong and their best players have all had recent injuries|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	NO ! I don't think they are going to go much of anywhere until they get a new owner.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	hahaha good one|`|AA10958272	At what?|`|30K1WLruaa	no|`|1uRM6jjraa	What I think is that the Raiders are not going to be good this year because last year(2008) they were not playing that well. That is what I think.|`|Wgp1065Laa	That franchise is like the song by the Hives<br>  "Tick Tick Tick Tick BOOM!"|`|PC60YeBIaa	They should, because based on past, current, and future salaries they'll have the best CB and P whoever played or will play the game.|`|IRsIdiKJaa	No! they will suck like every year! just like the cowboys with romo homo! The king of fumbles! wow!|`|09fdLaeIaa	probably not<br>  They pretty much always have bad seasons!|`|lpiMi3s3aa	7-9 probaly|`|ePDhY233aa	no. lets just say the lions would be better than them|`|c6v8veJgaa	Probably not, but it is the NFL so ya never know.|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	Not at all.|`|tBsMH9kGaa	No I don't think so..=/|`|9to0vRbhaa	nope|`|AA10776645	no|`|nlIpKw8Paa	no maybe 5 wins|`|2980af5b4722d033c6edc3ef6f679894aa	no. go cowboys!|`|HMv6jvUCaa	No, because Al Davis is still running things|`|4kdlE54Paa	The Raiders need to address a couple of issues.  They have a very poor D line that has trouble stopping the run.  They also lack the talent in WRs to help JaMarcus Russell come out of his shell.  Lastly, Al Davis needs to step aside and let his Head Coach do his job rather than using him as a puppet to execute his every whim.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not a chance.  They sucked horribly last year and not much is going to change.  They spent an insane amount on keeping Asomuagh, and granted he is the best CB in the league, thats way too much to give one player.  They also spent $4 million on a punter.  A PUNTER!!!  Thats insane.<br>  <br>  What all that means to the Raiders, is that they're wasting money, and unlike other sports that acutually allow that, its a big nono in football.  They'll have very little money to spend on other players who could otherwise help the team, so they're going to be stuck with no way to rebuild.  No chance they're good.|`|cdQryr7paa	They have a lot of work to do to improve.<br>  They have some talent, but unfortunately, as long as Al Davis is controlling the team, they are doomed to failure. The guy is senile.<br>  <br>  But you never know.<br>  They are in a very weak division, so that will help them stay a little competitive.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	We can dream.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	NOPE

Sometimes AI cant make any shots, and still takes TOO many! Dumars made the trade. I do not know much about curry, but he seems like a coach that is scared of the paint. Rip does his share well, but he sometimes misses those wide open shots or a critical shot that the game depends on. RASHEED! He has been terrible! He is obviously the main cause of the pistons downfall. He has a bad attitude, he turns games into his own 3 point contest, he gets the technicals, whenever the pistons are losing, he does not try. He makes the occasional 3 ball though. Heck, his attitude made us lose the ECFs last year! and stuckey, sometimes he has great games, but on ones that he does not do well when he is shooting, we always seem to lose. He is still improving and is a brilliant player who can penetrate well though. give AI some time, he will adapt better. Chauncey did not go well with rip for a while, but look at him after that period.|`|AA10263761	They all got old at the same time.<br>  and now we see chauncey Billups deserved more credit than he was given|`|TrARAwGRaa	2 things the first ai he doesnt fit in with the pistons. but more importantly they dont have the drive or fire that they used to, to win. also they started going down hill after losing wallace. and brown|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	They are not crossing thier "T"s|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Do You mean the Pistons.

Chris Paul tops steals per game but don't belong in the top 20 of blocking category and Dwight Howard tops the blocks per game but is not on top 20 of steals per game. Dwyane Wade is in the top 3 of steals category and if 2 players are tied on each spot in bpg then Dwyane is in 19th place that includes him in the top 20 of steals and blocks, only player that did it this season.|`|NALuet7Zaa	I want lebron to win, with him defending the best player on any team and he can defend players from pf, sf, pg, sg at any given time... but, dwight is the most likely choice... dat dudes a beast when it comes to coming inside his paint...|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	I think it is either Dwight Howard, Dwyane Wade, or Lebron. But there is 90% change Dwight will take it.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Dwight Howard.  Best rebounder, blocker and is a great on ball defender.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be surprised if LeBron won it.  I would love to see him get it, but he doesn't deserve it this season...<br>  He is playing great D though.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	it will be between dwight howard and c. paul. his name is in there only because of that streak he had going

H8u7gMAYaa	probably the Spurs, in my opinion they have been one of the most consistent teams in the last 10 years, yet they have been labeled as boring, which is something I don't find when I am watching Tony Parker driving the lane, Ginoblil makes a crazy layup or when Bruce "Lee" Bowen do a high kick.|`|f7OHg8PCaa	Gotta say Jazz, Heat, and Blazers. All in order most to least underappreciated|`|tLY2jFUxaa	The Bucks.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	Memphis Grizzlies and New Jersey Nets|`|KydnrU5raa	I would say either portland or atlanta.the trailblazers were a bad team last year, and people still think they are. but they are not! they have improved dramatically! atlanta continues to improve aswell, they were 8th seed in the east last year, now they are 4th, after the celtics, cavs, and magic!|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	1. Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder got off to a horrible start and although their record is bad, they have been great against the spread lately. Ten of the Thunder’s thirteen wins have come at home.<br>  <br>  2. Milwaukee Bucks. Presently holding the last playoff spot in the East I expect the Bucks to move up to a higher position. Milwaukee has a lot of talent as they have seven players averaging in double figures for points per game. <br>  <br>  3. Golden State Warriors. The Warriors look to be hitting their stride right now. Golden State is on a three game winning streak and putting up big numbers with their run-and-gun offence. Andris Biedrins looks to be a force inside.|`|quCfpWM7aa	ill tell you who; My Miami Heat is the most under appreciated team right now. although they got smacked by the magic recently. But you have to give them credit for coming from a 15 win season last year to a team thats holding 5th place in the east above teams with waaay better players including detroit.|`|FGLvlH65aa	That would be the Utah Jazz.  They have played only 3 games this season with their core of starters, yet they are still in contention.  Plus they beat the Lakers, Celtics, and Hornets all in a row! D-will should have been an all-star both this year and last.  So the answer is the Utah Jazz!|`|bQqkdPL9aa	By underappriciated i think you mean a team that has won and still gets little or no credit?<br>  <br>  If thats what you mean then it has to be the Spurs... I'm not a fan of the Spurs, but they seem to always be winning when everyone thinks their done. So yeah.. spurs.<br>  <br>  GO BULLS|`|HiuNSScLaa	miami heat <br>  denver nuggets<br>  yah and the jazz<br>  yah and trailblazers<br>  kind of the hawks|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Jazz and Thunder|`|AA11488609	Jazz.

H8u7gMAYaa	It looks good. Full of All-Stars. How can you go wrong with that?<br>  <br>  Plus, you have a great bench.|`|KydnrU5raa	you need a point guard that makes himself and everybody else better. I suggest chauncey billups for PG.<br>  <br>  for center, you cant really go wrong with dwight howard. He is strong, sturdy, big man, and can really penetrate in the paint.<br>  <br>  i would also suggest taking ron artest off the team.|`|bQqkdPL9aa	ummmm wat about LeBron??|`|HiuNSScLaa	what mamba said but what are we talking about a vid game real (wich it will never happen) i dont get it|`|9jwNS1YUaa	In real life, it looks like a time-bomb. Not enough playing time to go around, so VC will become a little *****. AK47 will go to Europe. Bibby will retire. Kobe will destruct the team. The lone bright spot would be watching Kevin Love blossoming while learning from Duncan after Chandler gets hurt. <br>  <br>  In a video game, it looks boring as hell because there is no way you could ever lose.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	On A Scale of 1-10 I will give You A 6.8.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	dont like it. sorry. <br>  tony parker, tim duncan,.. they need to go! i dont want any players that play dirty on my team

Tony Parker was gonna try and beat it but decided not to take the risk after getting a call from Popovich.|`|uFk8ohenaa	Probably Allen Iverson.|`|XMxf8BGSaa	Cuba Gooding JR.|`|bQqkdPL9aa	Barbosa... Did u see this dude run! <br>  <br>  also on the list is AI, tony parker, ROSE, Devin Harris|`|KydnrU5raa	Allen Iverson, no doubt.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	right now. maybe Harris from NJ.

Vep76FT9aa	because of their players. heat are better|`|NALuet7Zaa	well the addition of Mo williams was what James needed to get the Cavaliers at the top spot in the east and only 1 game behind the lakers... just think if he had one more, he would have been on the streak to break the bulls record of 72-10... that's how good they are now... one more role player and the cavs will be unstoppable...|`|kFcdwVwdaa	im guessing because you bought them and created a team chemistry. how much did you buy them for?|`|vVLwrzGbaa	They have a GREAT team.<br>  And Delonte is no longer injured!|`|AA10263761	Cause Lebron Is A Beast|`|9NVwFNjOaa	they got mo williams from the bucks in the off season,<br>  not to mention that west just came off ir & put 20 up on detroit.<br>  & they have really good teamwork spreading the ball around the perimeter. i loook for them to go to the eastern confrence finals, & maybe the championship.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	They have Mo and Delonte and LeBron gets better every Year. Mo and Delonte have changed the Team.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	cause they are the best
NALuet7Zaa	I'm not a hater of both players, but Griffin is like a lebron sort of type of player, i think... Hansborough, is like a mark madson type of player.. if u watch the nba, u'll know what i mean... <br>  <br>  but about your game, if you can shoot, den u have such a great advantage... cause if u shoot well, the defender will have to defend ur shot... that way u pump fake and lay up... just be smart... the thing is size doesnt matter.. be smart with the ball, and u r clearly going to be good...  but study griffin, he's better den  hansborough, trust me...|`|9NVwFNjOaa	fk hansborough he soft in side, blake has an mid range jumper & i see that his brother is following in foot steps watch for taylor griffin next year, i dont like hansborough never will, i like UNC but he weak & oveeeerrraattteeeddd

9e9996f674e52d2497ca2a97f53058a7aa	That $12 million figure angrily quoted by Calhoun is the GROSS income from the Men's Basketball Program. It does not take into account expenses, advertising, payroll for coaches and assistant coaches, stadium operation and upkeep, player stipends, uniforms, athletic trainers, medical expenses, etc.   He does not hand $12 million per year to the University. <br>  <br>  That said, if he and Geno didn't have their programs winning year in and year out, who among us would even know that UCONN existed? You can't measure the financial impact of a coach like Calhoun on an otherwise nondescript school like University of Connecticut. <br>  <br>  He could have been less of a douche in the presser, though, and indicated that he was at least sensitive to the residents of a state facing a multi billion dollar deficit and huge increases in homeless and unemployment, instead of going all scary dad on the kid.|`|Nkwv2hygaa	Nope.

They named that award after him.|`|YJIivf2Haa	Dwayne Wade played his heart out that year its funny how when time goes by and a team/player stops winning championships or they get hurt people throw them under the bus.  Wade earned his finals MVP. Look at Chauncey Billups he was the reason Detroit won the Finals that year and he got the MVP then because he took them to Eastern Conference Finals 6 times in a row (deep playoff runs) Detroit decided it was time to throw him under the bus to and look how that worked out for the Pistons. Bottom line all of the Finals MVP's earned that award and they performed at the highest stage under the most pressure you have to give them their credit.|`|a8yDDprlaa	Tony Parker, but he deserved it because he played at a different level against the cavs.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Billups?

zhXFtgPqaa	I have been and it is amazing. It is cool to be amongst people that love the WWE. You get to play cool activities, like Smackdown vs. Raw, and best of all your favorite WWE superstars are there. You can get their autograph, shake hands with them, and get a picture. <br>  <br>  I would highly recommend for you to go, I have been to a lot of them, and I have never left disappointed. There is a wrestling ring, and mini entrance ramp set up (at least at the one's I've been to), you can step in the ring and do imitations of superstars and it is a really awesome experience.|`|8UGCCPHRaa	I was gonna go but im worried it will be too much of a little kid thing|`|BglekVnQaa	Yeah. I went to one. Cade and Murdoch and Jimmy Hart were there. It was so much fun. You win prizes, play SVR, win DVDs, commentate a match and look at what's inside Superstar's locker rooms, get free postcards, and take a pitcture with a WWE Championship.

YN93QRdyaa	I don't think so. I don't he has the tools to beat Silva, I personally feel he would lose to Maia, Marquardt or Okami, and to be honest I think he'll be doing well just to beat Henderson. I don't feel he's going to bring anything against Henderson that Rich Franklin didn't.<br>  <br>  Bisping is a good fighter, but he's being promoted very heavily in the UFC which is leading some folks to overrate his abilities. He's certainly a nice technical striker, but he hasn't shown real nasty power, and he hasn't got the ground game to hang with the top guys in the division.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	yes he can, heck what i'm I saying actually while Ander Silva is the one that's holding the belts then nobody has a chance to ever be the champion in the 185 division.|`|AA10069553	If he beats Henderson definitively then I think he can.

Please people, he can lose-Just not to Bisping, Silva's too aggressive for him, Bisping's an above average fighter but not in Silva's league, (C'mon I can respect his ability, But not everyones claim that he's the pound for pound best)

dpSr0icwaa	G36 definately<br>  <br>  of course you can buy 4 AKs for the price of one G36|`|U0Rvsabdaa	G36. It is a better piece of firearms engineering, without question. <br>  <br>  But if I had to train an army of illiterate conscripts to clean and use a weapon, the Kalashnikov wins.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	It's like comparing a Mercedes and a Ford pick-up. One costs a ****-load the other is made for under $50. I don't know about the HK but I have never had a malfunction with my Chinese AK.|`|dVaN1wIJaa	Now listen. They are 2 different cartridges. The ak-47 shoots the 7.62x39mm or .308 of an inch. The g36c shoots the 5.56x45 or .223 of an inch. The ak-47 is not known to be accurate past 400 yards. The ballistic coefficeint of the 5.56 is higher than the 7.62 (ak round). The 5.56 is more stable, more accurate, but, the ak47 shoots a bigger bullet. It will do more damage to a human, and it has more knockdown power (kinetic energy). G36c has a shorter barrel than the g36k so its less accurate. They are both comftorable to hold, ak has more recoil.They are both great and are specifically good at something better than the other.|`|XjCu4c7Zaa	Better the Ar-15!!!!!!  I'm not fond of the ak47 or g36c....

There just to crude|`|8KxNa0eVaa	The G36C is more accurate at longer ranges, but IN MY OPINION, the AK47 makes up the not so good accuracy with it's stopping power and durability.

oqQjnpfGaa	Wow, first of all, wish you the best in the playoffs. <br>  <br>  Bottom Line recommendation: <br>  Drop Monta Ellis for Rodney Stuckey will be good. <br>  <br>  Matt Barnes and Steve Blake are pretty inconsistent.  Blake will be good for assists/3pts.  I think it'll be good to keep Terry if you think you can advance to the finals without him, if not drop him (or Ellis) for Stuckey will be fine.  <br>  <br>  Keep Manu since he is only out for two weeks or so.  Hopefully his injury is not that serious. <br>  <br>  Good Luck once again!|`|7028a57dd0c204e4a29c1640ccbcb4b6aa	If you're guaranteed a spot in the playoffs, keep your current roster. It's better to have the best team come playoff time than it is to make sure you have a better regular season record.|`|xQFWjFyZaa	Dropping Terry for Stuckey wouldn't be so bad.|`|guLruSbqaa	packerfan

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Not a chance of that happening.  I have heard Kyle say he wants to go try F1 after awhile, maybe after he turns 30 and has won a couple of championships.  He is under a lucrative contrct with JGR right now and with all the success he is having he will not be going to a start up F1 team anytime soon.  There are only 2 or 3 teams capable of winning the championship in F1 at this time and he would not go anywhere that he wouldn't have a chance of winning.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|mTGEeCHaaa	The only names I've heard mentioned are AJ Allmendinger and Danica Patrick.  I won't miss either one of them.<br>  Kyle Busch has said that he might consider going to F1 when he's 30.  I think that's still a few years away.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	He's stated he'd like to try it closer to the age of 30.<br>  2010, I don't know about.<br>  <br>  *loves Patriots avatar*|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	He has said he would like to try it, but he can not wait till he is 30, thats way to old for F1, most guys are gone by 33-35. He need to get a Cup Championship, then go by the time he is 25, he can always come back to Cup and drive till he is as old as he wants to be. F1 is all about youth, theres a 20 y/o out there this yr, I think Lewis Hamilton was only like 22 or 23 when he won the Championship last yr in F1. I hope he goes to F1 Rowdy will do the USA proud, and heck I'll go visit my friends in Germany, France, and Italy to see him, and hopefully we will have a F1 race back in the US and Canada by then.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	maybe by 2015 or after he wins the cup|`|XNdDrXAzaa	what ever turns his crank.

I kinda like the guy|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I don't think it will be an option..|`|9OVm1hL0aa	Never, as far as I know, he doesn't have road course experience like that.  He grew up racing Karts, Legend Cars, and Late Models in Las Vegas at the Bullring. <br>  <br>  He'd never leave NASCAR for F1, especially the way his team is running now and he popularity growing so fast in NASCAR.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	Hahahahaaaa,<br>  Hohohohohohhhhh.<br>  Heheheheeeeeeeeee.<br>  <br>  No, never heard that.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	I'd heard Allmendinger might be going, but I don't see Kyle leaving. He's still got too much to accomplish in NASCAR. I honestly don't know much about Formula 1, but he doesn't seem to fit that mold.|`|AA12255396	Its NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN and the driver rumored was AJ Allmindinger not Kyle Busch|`|NOool8qIaa	he will stay in nascar
9vALs3kkaa	Out of those three i would pick San jose, but i dont think any of them will win, the devils will win because all season they have been without brodeur and have been awesome, just imagine how good they will be with him in the lineup, they have lots of depth.|`|DP9mrJ1Oaa	SAN JOSE SHARKS!|`|TsRgRLuiaa	if i had to pick one of those prob. San Jose<br>  <br>  but i like the Capitals so hopefully they will win|`|UG1wEbBJaa	Neitherof the three, the Florida Panthers will win it all with David Booth, Thomas Vokoun, and Bryan McCabe lol|`|FG3qT6BWaa	I've been backing my Bruins for years and a slump won't change that. We have alot of good young players and some great veterans. I really do think we will turn this around by the playoffs. GO BRUINS|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Red Wings are stacked and will win, Sharks will choke like always, and the Bruins will lose to the Caps or Flyers because they can't beat them for some reason.|`|HNE7dJQiaa	Boston, I have faith in them, but im still pulling for anaheim even though its slim to none|`|GRfnMIQTaa	The Bruins are slumping yes, but everyone has peaks and valleys in a season, and more often than not the team witht the best record doesnt win the cup. II think Boston has the tools to take it all the way. Kessel, Savard, Wheeler, Krejci, Ryder, and Bergeron provide great offense. Chara leads a solid D corps including Andrew Ference and Dennis Wideman. And the goaltending is superb, Two of the top 5 goalies in the league by GAA. I think Claude Julien has them primed for a cup run. I cant count out Detroit however, they are experienced like no other team. i think San Jose is running at too high a pace and will tire in the playoffs. Also, watch for an upset alert in the West- Chicago Blackhawks led by Toews, Kane, and Campbell, look poised to go deep into the playoffs, and i see them as one of only a few teams capable of taking a best of seven series against Detroit|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	None of the above. The Bruins don't have a prayer of making it and are primed to be the first round upset of the playoffs. The Wings have no goaltending right now and are going to be hard pressed to repeat without any, the Sharks are a load of chokers lead by the biggest of the bunch in Thornton.|`|X6xsnDJ8aa	I would say that it would be... San Jose wins, Boston loses 3-2|`|jRTJbmEDaa	None of them. They all suck. Devils will|`|ZF4uKvFgaa	None Dallas Stars!! haha =)
TCehI17kaa	I will say that anything is possible.  According to some information he struck out Ruth & Gehrig respectively.<br>  <br>  <br>  In her teen years (17), Jackie played for a women's team in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and attended a special baseball school in Atlanta, Georgia. There she attracted the attention of Joe Engel, the president and owner of the Chattanooga Lookouts, who offered her a contract to play for the entire 1931 season. On March 28th of that year she signed the contract and became an official member of the Chattanooga Lookouts, a Class AA minor league team.<br>  <br>  <br>  The New York Yankees and the Chatanooga Lookouts were scheduled to play an exhibition game in Chattanooga, Tennessee on April 1, 1931. Due to rain the game was postponed until the 2nd. Seventeen-year-old Jackie Mitchell, brought in to pitch in the first inning after the starting pitcher had given up a double and a single, faced Babe Ruth. After taking a ball, Ruth swung and missed at the next two pitches. Mitchell's fourth pitch to Ruth was a called third strike. Ruth slammed down his bat and yelled at the umpire before returning to the Yankees bench.<br>  <br>  Next up was Gehrig who swung through the first three pitches to strike out. A seventeen-year-old girl had struck out two of the greatest hitters in baseball history using seven pitches and five swing-throughs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Mitchell_(baseball)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Mitc...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  This is her site as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jeanpatrick.com/jackiemitchell.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeanpatrick.com/jackiemitchel...</a>|`|RJghPceKaa	i think part of the reason they struck out was not because of her ability, but because they did not expect anything from a woman|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Babe Ruth struck out 1,330 times in his career so a lot of people can claim that.|`|NCqsnlClaa	<a href="http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clevelandicons.blogspot.com/</a>

Lower the rod tip and quickly raise it to start the lures  swing.  When you reach the back of your arc, lower the rod  with the tip of your rod pointed at your target and your bait will swing forward hitting your desired target.<br>  <br>  Pitching is also an underhand motion, but you can do it at longer distances.  when pitching put your reel in freespool andd let out the same amount of line as the lenght of your rod.  Hold your lure in your  free hand so it is even with your reel. Lower your rod tip toward the water and quickly snap it upwards while letting go of the lure. As the lure moves forward and starts pulling line off the reel start lowering your rod tip to control the height of the lure above the water.  Use your thumb to gently feather the spool as the lure falls in the water.

ZKikquiOaa	I would have to say that the best type of bow to start with would be a recurve bow with sights.  I'll explain why.<br>  <br>  There are 3 major bow types, a longbow, a recurve and a compound.  Both the recurve and compound can have sights installed, I've only seen one longbow that can accept sights.  <br>  <br>  The compound is the easiest to start with, so easy that you can develop some bad habits without any significant performance impact for beginners.  The problem with a compound will become significant down the road, once you hit the intermediate and advanced stage you'll begin to see the difference between using optimal form and sub optimal form.  <br>  <br>  The longbow is the hardest of the three to learn with.  Without sights, you're constantly guessing which is the problem when you're not hitting the target, is it your aiming or your form.  Longbows also usually not made in beginner poundages.  Starting at 30 lbs is not a good idea, there are many subtle things that you need to feel out in this sport.  With 30 lbs, it's very easy to miss these things.<br>  <br>  A recurve with sights, is the middle road.  It's not as hard to use as a longbow and not quite as easy as a compound.  It'll still punish you for using improper form, but not quite as harsh as a longbow would.  With a sight on the bow, you can focus on form and not so much on aiming.  Just point that sight at the target, if the arrows aren't grouping well then the problem is most likely your form.  <br>  <br>  If you're in the US, try www.usarchery.org and find a range near you.  Some might have equipment for you to use, to build up your strength and develop a good form.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I just got my son a Fred Bear compound and it is great!

AA10068004	I read about this guy on various websites. On Feb 13th he was sent to the minors after clearing waivers. He had a shoulder injury that forced him to miss 14 games.

This was his 4th trip to the NHL and his 4th trip back.  He's out of options now, and Burke said he has no plans to resign him (and I doubt anybody else will sign him to an NHL contract either).|`|oJsrGmmPaa	There was also no room for him in the line up.

bJn83u7Oaa	Vick is not an NFL QB.  I doesn't matter that he went to jail, he wasn't good before he went in.  I think the Vikings should go after Jeff Garcia.  They need a leader who can run the West Coast Offense I believe Garcia can do that.  I also think Garcia would be a good mentor for John David Booty.  If only Bad Childress would get over T-Junk and realize that he's not the answer.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well the Bears defence would always know what to do, but that would be good for them. It would help them finish second in the NFC North.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	LOL......you would actually wish Vick on the team you like?  If you're looking for a QB why go from bad (Tavaris) to worse (Vick).  Vick is not a NFL caliber QB plus do the Vikes really want the PR nightmare that would be having Vick on your team?|`|4kdlE54Paa	Believe it or not, Sage Rosenfels would be a better option than Michael Vick.  The Vikings backfield is stacked with AP and Chester Taylor.  You have 2 very dynamic RBs that can wear down a defense.  What the Vikings need is an accurate and confident QB to manage the passing game so that the opposing defense does not stack the line with defenders.  Doing this will make the running game more dominate.  Rosenfels, when he started in both seasons when Matt Schaub was injured, did quite well considering the talent and protection he was getting.  He has an above average completion percentage (better than Vicks by almost 10%) and was a solid back up.  What the Vikings need is a QB that can manage the offense similarly to what Kerry Collins did with the Titans.  T<br>  <br>  he Vikings already have a scrambling/running QB with Tarvaris Jackson.  He is not nearly effective in the run like Vick, but he has the same problem of not completing his passes.  I would say that Rosenfels would thrive in the Vikings offense if given the chance.  He will definitely not be a Peyton Manning or Tom Brady, but he can be similar to a Kerry Collins.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Meh, neither are great options.  Rosenfels is not a good QB, and if they're honestly thinking him, I'd rather stick with Tavarius.  Vick isnt a good QB either, but the plays he can make with his legs can break a game open.  He's your better choice overall, but there's no guarentee that he'll be back and ready for the start of the season, nor do we even know if he'll be in shape and as effective.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	Sage Rosthenfels??? Is that the same guy that tried to be a hero against the Colts LMAO. He thought he was Vick on that play. I say the Vikings go after Vick.<br>  <br>  Unless any of u know Mike Vick and talk to him everyday dont say he will be out of shape|`|scdOQ2CAaa	Whether its the 49ers<br>  or the VIkings<br>  or even Oakland<br>  whoever takes Vick will be successful, hes payed is dues and is in perfect shape, i look forward to the comback from Vick|`|6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	What?  You don't want to keep Tarvaris Jackson?  Sheesh, the guy only has a couple years and everyone is ready to throw him under the bus.  Then again, he is not that good anyways (he is developing a lot slower than expected).<br>  <br>  Taking Michael Vick would not be a good thing.  You're run game might jump, but he is a horrible passer.  You would be wasting Berrian, Rice, and Shiancoe unless you had them run very simple routes.  Looking at the rushing game, if the Vikings came across a nasty rush defense, Vick would end up collapsing on both fronts (he has trouble handling pressure behind the O-Line).  <br>  <br>  Sage Rosenfels is not a bad option, but look at how he did in Houston.  He was too inconsistent to maintain a stable QB option when Matt Schaub went down.  Also, what is Houston looking to get from Minnesota is Rosenfels heads over?  Houston wants to overload their rush defense and snagging one of their starting linemen may end up hurting your team more in the long run.<br>  <br>  Free agency is not looking too strong on the QB front.  The best choices are Byron Leftwich, Jeff Garcia, or (yes I am saying this) Rex Grossman.  The future QB for Minnesota is most likely a draft prospect though, since there is better upside for a rookie than most of the veterans floating around the market.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	1: they wont get Vick, their owner doesnt like having cons on his team, and doesnt like having distractions on his team especially if they sign him they will have PETA protesting<br>  <br>  2: Sage Rosenfels will not help this team out at all, he younger version of Gus Frerotte, and we dont need him<br>  <br>  3: I want them to go after Derek Anderson, because he is a good qb and the only reason he sucked last year is all his recievers kept dropping the balls<br>  <br>  but what will really happen is they trade for Rosenfels and Tarvaris gets the starting job, and impresses people because hopefully Brad Clueless has him run a little more because if they had him run when a play breaks down instead of throw the ball away they would have beaten the Eagles, but Clueless is an idiot and needs to go|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	the vikings have been cleaning house the last few years, they are not taking anyone in with big criminal records they are trying to get away from negative media attention... T-JACK is not that bad, the offensive line (right side) is bad and the wr's with the exception of berrian like dropping balls all the time.  they need to keep t jack and if they can pull something off sign jeff garcia. the draft and free agency they need a RT WR'S  and a shutdown corner and with late round picks they need to get a DT for the aging williams duo..|`|MbcvI1A9aa	every 1 hates vick 4 what hes done but im sure hes sorry and wont make the same mistake. vick and A.P. would be hard to stop. sage rosthenfels? hes not the answer. garcia is also a free agent who i picture to be very good in minnesota.|`|GT5dKSOdaa	Kerry Collins|`|nlIpKw8Paa	y would they want vick they all ready have jackson who is a bad passer.|`|uFk8ohenaa	dk..probably should go after my man Vick after he get out dat pen.|`|q0xFtWt4aa	hmmmm.Isn't Garcia the same guy who could not make it in Tampa? Vick has been out of the league but he is an ATHLETE. You don't lose that no matter how long you have been away from the game. (if you can go from bagging groceries, you can play football!) Vick maybe a little rusty but he still can play IMO. I don't think the Vikings will take him though b/c Jackson is almost a spitting image of him.....Look for another QB(not on the verge of 1000 i.e. Brad Johnson) to be signed while Jackson is groomed to be the franchise guy. It would not make sense to DRAFT a QB when you are in the process of training one.|`|Tt3aZltJaa	Mike Vick is not someone you should hope to have. He cannot be in football shape and would look very sluggish with the 2 years he has had off.

DzqEoMbVaa	they cut weight so they can pass the WEIGH IN.  If they're not at the specific weight, they wont be able to fight. whatever weight they put on after doesnt matter. the fight is usually the next day, so they wont be able to gain a huge amount of weight in that time|`|ZKikquiOaa	I don't know about others, but it seems like cheating to me.  It's a way to go into a lighter weight class.  So let's take Anderson Silva, his walking weight is around 200lbs, so normally he should be fighting in the Light Heavy Weight division.  Yet, he cuts weight when he fights so he can fight in the Middleweight at 185.  Recently he started making a foray into the crowded lightheavy weight division at 205.<br>  <br>  See, weight give you an advantage, so you cut from 200 to 185 and by the time you fight, you're probably in the 190-195lbs range.  That's 10 more pounds than someone who doesn't have to cut.

Really, most players in the NBA are gifted with a talent for playing basketball or unusually tall, and I don't think that stressing yourself over something that literally sounds impossible. Overcoming your fear, is nearly impossible too you just have to face the fear. Also, if you really want to become a pro, you have to be 100% serious about this and you can't goof off. Also doing well in basketball doesn't mean you should blow off school, because blowing off school would be bad. Playing straight out of high school is possibly the toughest challenge in the NBA but maintaining a good grade point average through out college and playing ball is another. If you want to get serious you need to overcome a lot and just take it seriously.

With a healthy roster, they will add the experience and clutch ability of guys like James Posey and Peja Stojakovic to Chandler, West, and Chris Paul.<br>  <br>  the Rockets will not have T-Mac and may struggle to find baskets from their backcourt.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Rockets 4-2.|`|dXblgZEzaa	The Rockets.They have a better defense and better options on the team.|`|YJIivf2Haa	The Rockets have more talent but they never really came together that well. Plus Tracy McGrady is done for the season. The Hornets are talented to but that whole trade thing with Tyson Chandler is going to disgruntle him and he is going to question if he is really wanted in New Orleans the rest of this season. I think the Hornets win, Chris Paul is the best point guard in the league right now and he gives them the edge over Houston. Yao is good but will he stay injury free we will see and Artest is a good defender but the Hornets have to many shooters plus Paul's ability to get into the lane.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	New Orleans Hornets will easily beat Houston Rockets. Hornets is a very young team with plenty of potential while Rckets is a contending team plagued with injuries. With Ron Artest and Yao Ming carrying the load left by T-Mac. Hornets got lots of talent from CP3, Morris Peterson, David West and Rasual Butler that can bring them until the last round of NBA Playoffs.|`|7QMRiROQaa	I'm gonna go the other way on this one, since everyone seems to love the Hornets. Even though Tmac is out for the rest of the season I think Houston has better team chemistry. New Orleans to me seems to be lacking production from some of their guys who actually played with heart last year. I think some people just really love chris paul a lot and therefore put much faith in the team. The Hornets could be out of the playoffs and I'm sure ppl would still be pushing them...why, I don't know.|`|4dy4AvW6aa	Hornets.. The have tyson chandler back so CP3 will give him lots of assists.

Tracy McGrady is out so that would make it harder for Houston. No one on the Rockets will be able to defend Chris Paul. Yao is great, but that guy gets tired too much and in a 7 game series he'd be too tired, especially if Chris Paul runs the break a lot. And I liked Alston, but he's not there for Houston anymore.|`|CQuHkB6paa	the hornets are you serious i mean they got chris paul enough said if the rockets had a healthy team they might have put up a good fight but really i mean are you serious man the rockets would get swept no question about it|`|fYOgKaJWaa	hornets, they have better team chemistry and leadership.|`|3z7CKybfaa	The hornets are a better team, I think theyd win in 6.

nqBhFyt7aa	Before Tryouts:<br>  Get yourself into shape [cheer exercises]. You should work on your flexibility, power, and your endurance. You might want to find out if there are any tryout camps, practices, and/or sessions before tryouts to give you some practice. You may also want to look into getting involved in some tumbling and/or dance classes to help with your technique and get your body physically prepared. Here are some other tips prior to tryouts:<br>  1.) Stretch as much as you can [stretching exercises] - focus on your hamstrings and legs for toe touches and stretches<br>  2.) Work on your Endurance [endurance exercises] - work on your endurance so that you can keep up at tryouts<br>  3.) Strength train [Strength exercises] - you need to be able to lift and be lifted. Many skills require you abs, legs, arms, shoulders to be ready to handle the stress.<br>  4.) Power train [Power excersises] - many cheerleading skills require for you to be explosive even if you are a flier or base.<br>  5.) Work on your Jumps [jumping excersises] - it will be a required skill and you can work on it in the safety of your home.<br>  6.) Take Tumbling classes - you will get a leg up on the other girls trying out, because some will not be able to tumble<br>  7.) Take Dance classes - dancing is similar to cheerleader, so get used to moving your body.<br>  8.) Work on motions in the mirror - it is the little things that count and I have even seen college girls make the mistake of not working on their motions.<br>  <br>  Tryout sessions pointers:<br>  Tryouts will usually have a practice session beforehand. You will be given some cheers, chants, and a dance to memorize during this time. You will also be given the chance to work on your skills beforehand so use your time wisely. Here are some session pointers:<br>  1.) Don’t compare yourself to others. It might make you nervous. I have seen girls who would have made the team give up, because they thought that they were not going to make one of the spots.<br>  2.) Don’t' be afraid to ask for help. Get all of your questions answered before the tryouts. It makes you look like you care about the tryouts, and you get all of your questions answered so you confidence improves.<br>  3.)GO to the sessions. Some girls won't even go to the sessions, and I guarantee you will miss something that you could use in your favor.<br>  4.)When practicing the cheers, chants, and dances be sure you stand somewhere were you can see the instruction.<br>  5.)Pay attention to questions asked by the other, and NO goofing around.<br>  6.)Take a blank tape to be able to record the music for the dance.<br>  7.)Again practice you motions in the mirror. BUT this time also do it with you cheers, chants, and dance.<br>  8.)Pratice with other individuals so that you can critique one another.<br>  9.)Go full out when practicing, so that when the time comes to do it in front of the judges you are ready.<br>  <br>  Morning of tryouts:<br>  1.)Get plenty of sleep<br>  2.)Eat a good and healthy breakfast, but don't fill yourself up. Stick with Oatmeal, fruits, and/or vegetables and stay away from junk food. <br>  3.)Stay away from Caffeine or junk food. It will make your voice break.<br>  4.) Bring a snack and some water as it could be a long day.<br>  5.)When getting dressed wear school colors and a bow in your hair<br>  6.)Be kind on the makeup and possibly wear a temporary tattoo on your cheek with the school mascot<br>  <br>  Tryouts:<br>  1.)Show up to tryouts ahead of time to get use to your surroundings. It will calm your nerves.<br>  2.)Stretch out beforehand<br>  3.)Practice you cheers, chants, and dance beforehand so that they are fresh in your head, but don’t over do it.<br>  4.)Remember not to wear yourself out, it could be a long day.<br>  5.)Try not to sit down too much, it will tighten up your muscles and you could get an injury<br>  6.)When you are called run in (or tumble) and "hit the crowd" showing your enthusiasm<br>  7.)Always smile. It gives everyone the impression that you are happy to be here and makes you approachable. Both are qualities of a good cheerleader so keep this in mind. Become a judges favorite and get on their good side.<br>  8.)Yell load, but don’t scream<br>  9.)Make sure your words are clear and crisp. Do not sing the words.<br>  10.)If miss a skill don't frown or pout, or the judges will see this and possibly deduct this from your score<br>  11.)No matter what skill you are attempting just make sure you do it and don't give up. I have seen many girls give up on tumbling when they could have given themselves some points by trying something simple.<br>  <br>  You usually don't have to know how to do a tuck, but it will help your tumbling score. So heres some tips on tucks: <br>  Here are some tips to help improve your splits:<br>  <br>  1. Warm bath - Taking a warm bath beforehand will loosen up the muscles and tendons<br>  <br>  2. Stretch - Stretching is very important in improving your splits. Here are some exercises:   <br>  -Butterfly<br>  -hamstring<br>  -Lunges<br>  3. Don't Bounce - Bouncing when stretching can cause more damage to your muscles, than good. <br>  <br>  4. Get assistance - Si|`|uKyfRzxIaa	if it's school cheerleading there's no flips it's just basically dance but gym cheerleading is VERY competitive and flippy.|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	umm in cheer you don't refer to it as "flip" theres a name for every tumble.<br>  you have to know how to do 5 jumps: toe touch pike double toetouch herke [both ways] and side toe touch.<br>  you have to know how to do a ram and a heel stretch,<br>  you have to know a standing tumble and a running tumble.<br>  [ i did backlayout for standing and a roundoff backhandspring for running]<br>  <br>  and if you have someone hold your waist while you're doing a jump; have them push you up; it helps keeping your back straight and get you up higher.<br>  <br>  **you have to keep your back straight in everyhting; you are judged on being coordinated.<br>  **be loud and enthusiastic|`|2p7XZQcRaa	You don't have to know how to tumble (do flips) but it would help you in tryouts.

nxymxSUFaa	Bud Selig has a great deal to answer for.  He obviously knew all along that Barry Bonds was on the juice during his home run march.  Yet Selig allowed the faithful Giant fans to continue to pay big bucks for tickets just to watch what has proved to be a bogus home run tally.<br>  <br>  Think of the millions of dollars spent to pad his pockets as well as the owners while innocent fans cheered for the cheater.<br>  <br>  The only reason Selig was appointed commissioner was because as a big league franchise owner he knew what as in the best interest of the owners and not necessarily baseball.

There's little that can actually be done without the consent of the union.

If you are looking for a scape goat how about Donald Fehr, and the Players Union, who continually shot down every plan for a drug testing program for years.  However, I am not even going to single him out since I put 100% of the blame directly on the shoulders of those players that elected to use drugs.|`|2YhigCnXaa	first even if its legal in baseball or not its illegal in the USA<br>  ex. Arod said that the stuff he used was not being tested for there for making it Not legal but Not Illegal problem is its a steroid and is very much illegal in the USA then know and always<br>  So yes he should be held accounted as i am 100% sure he knew what was going on ......<br>  <br>  But how about the Bush family...why you ask <br>  well who was one of the first roiders?? Canseco and where did he play when he first experimented with roids ?  A's / Rangers<br>  and well it pritty well known that managers and owners are aware of steroid use some even encourage it  .....and who was the owner of the rangers when conseco played BUSH <br>  so BUSH is to blame for roids in the MLB|`|QwCsFKLQaa	baseball should just be dismantled.  everything thats taken place in the past 30 years doesnt even count,   the fan base will NEVER come back|`|rv6zl5t3aa	LOL...nice line from Frost/Nixon<br>  <br>  He should be held accountable, along with Donald Fehr. They should both resign and baseball needs to start fresh. Nothing good is going to happen as long as those two buffoons are still in there.|`|DLevM7WDaa	You know, I never thought about it, but yeah he probably will eventually be carted off to court!!!|`|TCehI17kaa	Him & Donald Fehr should be investigated by Congress again in my opinion.|`|CsBvnpkSaa	he's a bum, i say yes|`|c3tADklmaa	If it gets worst we should go to JERRY!!!! JERRY!!!! JERRY!!!! JERRY!!!! Well he blamed Romero for stuff to keep him healthy, his trainers and him don't know him but banned him 50 games immediately. Well almost since he has warnings before. But A-Rod admits the truth about it, shouldn't he acted quickly, the overpaid commish?|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well yeah, if he knew that it was going on he should have put the players through court.
Ar5VHDiBaa	start a league, set it up for offline draft, set waivers to 0 days..... invite 14 friends. determine a draft order (there are free draft order generators... just google it). have the draft on the message board. when the draft is over put one person from each team on the teams & set league to "ready" let the teams pick up their players off the waiver wire. once this is done check the teams to see that they don't have guys from the wrong teams.... set waivers back to 2 days.|`|frDcAqyWaa	I dunno, but i would not put money on that.|`|Zvdbe0H1aa	What would be the point??

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	No, you are trading away to very solid outfielders for one that is changing leagues and will endure the scrutiny of potentially being nothing more than a midseason trading chip. I can see that weighing on Matt....love the crazy good abilities but wonder if all the distractions wont have an effect on his play. Pence could hit 35 dingers (BA a bit of a concern but .270 is acceptable....RBIs shouldnt be a problem) and Wells in the every other year cycle...this is the "on" year and when healthy his numbers arent a whole lot lower than Hollidays in the first place (and he will swipe a few bags...bonus). Too costly in terms of what you give up potentially and too risky with all the "newness" that Matt will be dealing with.|`|syzMIfLLaa	Don't do it, Holliday is leaving the best hitters park in the world, in history, and going to oakland, which is a average hitters park at the very best, Both of the guys youd be loosing could easily be as good or better than he is this year.|`|aiBSMFWmaa	I would do it. Vernon Wells just hurt his hamstring (they don't know how badly, but its never a good sign to go down this early). Pence has yet offer more than his HR's. While hes a great up and commer, Holliday is a stud. <br>  <br>  I hate that people have written Matt off so early. He has been one of the best 5-stat players in the last few years. In COL he offered a great AVG, and tons of HR's, RUNS, RBIS, & SB. He's one of the best around. <br>  <br>  He has heard about the splits (better at COL than anywhere else) and he has heard the critisim. That doesn't bother him. 09 will prove everyone wrong, he has something to prove! The A's are a better team this season, and Giambi will complement him nicely. Also, he won't be OAK after the trade deadline (assuming the A's are losing), and he'll be on a contender that can probably pay to keep him. Oh, did I mention hes on a CONTRACT YEAR. Players play to their highest ability (seriously, this is a proven fact) on the years in which their playing for a contract. He will show up in 09, beter than ever!!!<br>  <br>  Wells is hurting, and Pence is still developing, GET THE BETTER PLAYER thats in his Prime!!! Holliday all the WAYY!!!!|`|PcJG3lrDaa	During the spanish annexation of northern New Guinea countless indonesian wars valiantly fought for the Twinkies that were secretly stored away after the terrible Nuclear Wars of the 1500's. The wars finally ended when John Wilkes Boothe found the last scroll of the torah and read until his eyes became gumballs.|`|AA11519561	Yes...do that trade.  Vernon is hurt and out for a month and Holiday is being vastly underrated this season.|`|88b32f4c7657b63ef626f1a39391d7e8aa	no way vernon wells alone is gonna put up matt Holiday numbers|`|MG6bYy6Qaa	YES.  I don't have high hopes at all of Vernon Wells.  I like Pence but not that much.  I believe that all the talk of Holliday dropping in production is overrated.  His HR's may go down, but he'll far outperform both Pence and Wells in the BA category.  He could also get traded to a better park mid-year.  <br>  I still believe his numbers will go down across the board, but that's because of the fact that is 2008 was amazing, rather than him doing poorly.|`|GIrqcxWAaa	It looks like a very reasonable trade. Go ahead and do it. Matt Holliday is probably gonna go off in the National League and Vernon Wells is definitely not putting up Hollidays numbers because hes gonna be injured for about a month. So continue with this trade.<br>  <br>  Also try to get Dustin Pedroia if you dont have him yet.|`|00OXpItPaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmVp7PGnxO8Sszcafhg1BtXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223153237AANYIiN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Ucbnl7VJaa	Well start looking at the used gun rack at your local shop. Savage model 110 are great rifles that were not expensive new and I have seen them in used racks for under $250 with a lot of bluing wear. Remington Winchester, Browning and other makes will tend to be more expensive used just as the were new. For around $300 you should be able to find a new Stevens model 200 (basically a non-Accutrigger Savage 110) and it should be good for a few decades of hunting.<br>  <br>  If the 98 mauser didn't fit you well... are you shorter then about 5'6"? IF so you might want to check out a youth model rifle or for a modest fee many good gunsmiths can shorten a full sized wood stock and fit a recoil pad.<br>  <br>  The trouble of fitting a scope to a Lee-Enfield is my only dislike about the design for hunting. They are very durable and reasonably accurate. The ammunition be it factory loads or handloads at safe pressures is  able to cleanly take deer out to maybe 300 yards with 150gr spitzers(225yds with the 174-180gr round nose designs) and most of the rifles can still shoot accurately enough out that far IF the shooter can do it.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The SKS is actually quite decent for deer -- BUT it is a close range deer cartridge.... If your shots are under 125 yards and you use decent ammo made for hunting the SKS will work well......<br>  <br>  On the other hand if you want something with a bit more reach and power then surely consider the Mosin Nagant...... It uses the 7.62X54MM cartridge -- It has similar power as the venerable 30-06 cartridge.....|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Got my Savage in .308 for about 200-250 brand new, Haven't had one problem with it yet.|`|9f1815216915b904efd9e933b1a5b03aaa	I would look at the Mossberg 464 lever action 30-30. It has a good price point and it is basically a winchester 94 with some improvements. It has metal over the Receiver so you can mount a scope and the empty cases eject sideways so they clear the scope. You can get a scope at Cabelas that has a ballistic reticle to compensate for bullet drop out to 250 yards if you use Hornady lever evolution ammo.|`|0R46pYb3aa	The 7.62X39 is adequate for deer, but the rifle you mention is greatly lacking in the accuracy department you'd want for a game gun.  Look for a used Remington 700 or a Ruger 77. As far as military surplus rifles, you can find a good Mauser in 8mm or 7X57mm, both excellent deer cartridges.  The 6.5 swede would be another excellent choice.|`|OrvTG44laa	It depends on what you mean by cheap.  The cheapest one will probably be a 243.  Personally, I'd get a larger caliber, like a 270.<br>  Here are some 243s.   <a href="http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/default.php?cPath=9935_13987_14246_14261&page=1&sort=5a" rel="nofollow">http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/default....</a>|`|DHIudHy2aa	If you buy a lee-enfield, you will never have to worry about it being underpowered or rugged. They are have an awesome action, it is quite smooth.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	The SKS Round 7.62x39 is equivalent to a 30/30, which has most likely put more meat in freezers than any other caliber in history as long as you pull the trigger inside 100 yards.<br>  <br>  If you want inexpensive, go with a Mosin.  You can find them for under $200 and the surplus ammo is dirt cheap.  7.62x54R also has plenty enough energy to get the job done.  Look for the weapons and ammo at any local gun show.|`|Erci1kSGaa	In my opinion, the lee enfield you mentioned is a good gun and can be mounted with a scope. ( i did it)  but if you want to go with something else..... i have a model 111 270. its a great gun. i was lucky and stumbled into 1 for 140$. but if you look in the papers and stuff you can find them fairly cheap. Happy hunting!|`|rWYp4ekeaa	a 270. win is a great caliber|`|UbRtV8QQaa	my choice would be a .270, .243, 30-06 those are good cheap ones if u get the right one

d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	I haven't done Physics for 18 years, but I do know the bits that apply to F1. <br>  <br>  You actually need to combine Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion in order to see the workings of aerodynamics in F1 cars.

It is just a variation of conservation of energy. In the simplest terms it means that the total mechanical energy at all points in a streamline flow is the same. In other words, if kinetic energy decreases potential energy increases (and vice versa)<br>  <br>  I'd suggest focusing only on the vertical forces because the complex profile of the car would make the computation of the drag forces extremely difficult. Consider the wings as inverted airfoils creating a "downforce" pressing the car to the ground, proportional to its relative velocity. The basic lift equation should work here, if you know the lift coefficient. Rosbif's link should give you the reference surface area, density can be obtained from the Met stations and speed is up to you. <br>  <br>  (Basic lift equation L = ?CL*ρ*Area*V2, where CL is lift coefficient, ρ is density and V is relative velocity) The link below should be of help.|`|yz6G7jfXaa	why don't you look into the Venturi principle used in F1 to produce downforce? it's called "ground effect". it was discovered by the Lotus team in late 70's, and has revolutionized racing ever since.|`|02kkSw3Laa	This is why I majored in History while in college. I agree with everything that Juls, Rosbif, and Firefox said...yeah, that's about right :D.|`|KTxxd700aa	The bigger the frontal area of an car, the more wind resistance it will encounter, so a larger car will travel slower than a smaller object with the same amount of power to propel it. Downforce complicates matters, because wind resistance can be used to improve a car’s performance if the forces are transferred in the right way to provide extra grip around corners, downforce is simply the force acting down on the ground. If you think of an aircraft, it has lift / a force acting upwards. A racing car has wings which work in the opposite direction to those on an aeroplane.<br>  Also, when you see a modified front wheel drive car with a rear wing, its only creating drag, as powered drive is not on the rear wheels so extra downforce on the rear is unnecessary, actually slows the car down, so chavs be warned!<br>  Sorry if this is too simple but I ain't no areodynamisist.
f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Massachusetts Law requires firearm owners to be licensed through their local Police Department or the Massachusetts State Police if no local licensing authority is available. A license is required by state law for buying firearms and ammunition. An applicant must have passed a State approved firearm safety course before applying for a license.<br>  <br>  All applications, interviews, fees, and fingerprinting are done at the local Police Department then sent electronically to the Massachusetts Criminal History Board for the mandatory background checks, and processing. All approved applicants will receive their license from the issuing Police Department. All licensing information is stored by the Criminal History Board. Non residents who are planning on carrying in the state must apply for a temporary LTC through the State Police before their travel.<br>  <br>  There are four different types of Firearm licenses issued in the state. The most restrictive license, the Firearm Identification License (FID), only allows the ownership of long arms (rifles or shotguns) that hold 10 rounds or less in their magazines. The Class B License To Carry (LTC) allows the ownership of handguns which hold 10 rounds or less or long arms with any capacity magazine. The Class A LTC allows the ownership of any capacity handgun, or longarm and the ability to carry concealed. Licenses are valid for 6 years.<br>  <br>  The issuing authority official may restrict the Class A LTC as he wishes, such as target and hunting only, which may effect the authorization of an individual to carry concealed.<br>  <br>  The final license is only issued for "machine guns" so I won't go into that.|`|a42JpX2uaa	I'm from this stupid state.  Yes, you have to take classes.  To own a the simplist of shotguns, .22's, or other hunting rifles, you need to get your FID.

ehfe97Zcaa	First off, just so you know, it's not called being "cleated" in rugby, it's called being "rucked". Also, we call cleats "sprigs". <br>  <br>  So here's the dilly. Had you not done anything, it's likely he would have been sent off for dangerous rucking. Though, of course you can't always let the ref deal with things like this, because sending someone off isn't always good enough, especially for an offense like that. <br>  <br>  Next time something like that happens, you should start turning up a few seconds late to your rucks and mauls. This way, if he's there you can charge in with a well aimed shoulder or elbow to the head. If he's wearing head gear, there is usually a hole at the top of the head. Hook your fingers through that and plant a good knee into his face. Also, let your team mates know what's happened, and let him know that your whole team knows. Watch him shrink into the background of the game, worried about the retaliation he's going to receive at every ruck.<br>  <br>  PS: just to round this out, a red card for a punch is completely ridiculous. It's definitely not deserving of anything more than a yellow. The ref needs to sort himself out.<br>  <br>  PPS: I, to some degree, agree with the poster after me. Sure, he probably doesn't need the encouragement. But in my opinion, the dirtiness is something that has always been a part of the game. I know people will complain about that kind of thing in this sterilised era, but it's the truth. The things that I talked about were things that were passed on to me by my grandfather and father and also from Craig Dowd, Andy Haden and the Whetton brothers (my father was a high level player, so we're family friends with many famous ABs). It's part of the mystique of the game, as long as it doesn't go too far. <br>  <br>  Incidentally, I've been playing for longer than 17 years. I was just a little older when I went from first-five to prop in one year :oP|`|fabf3a4ab60d6117be9407e330339181aa	They always say that it is the person that reacts is the one that always gets caught. Now if he cleated you like Haynesworth cleated that one guy then I would say morally you are okay, but if he didn't mean to then you may need anger management. LOL|`|rDrPI3DLaa	you shouldnt have retaliated..thats why you got sent off....the way to get back is at the bottom of a ruck or something when the ref cant see a thing|`|c86DKQyUaa	The ref might not have seen him do it, so next time smack him a bit more descretly ;)|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Two points against you. 1. You retaliated and got caught; 2. What was your head doing in the other side of the ruck?<br>  <br>  I would say you are a back who got caught in the ruck? I say this because forwards tend to be brighter and they don't get caught like that.|`|YsSwe1Laaa	Well, we only have a portion of the story here, so I'd go a bit slow at offering advanced methods in rugby mayhem to a beginner.<br>  <br>  What in the world is his face doing in a position where he can be rucked?  Means he's on the wrong side of the ball, first off, and face up??  That's not too flash, surely.  And, of course, we don't actually know from this post whether it was a ruck.  Maybe he caught a loose foot in an unbalanced line-out, or another player got cleared out and lost control.<br>  <br>  I don't think we have the information to say that the other player was dirty at all.  I can easily imagine an accident, albeit one that woudl anger the person stepped on.  As for him getting red-carded, well that depends on the circumstances, surely.  It is was just a couple of schoolboys swinging handbags at each other, that's one thing.  But if he sucker-punched the other kid (who might, after all, not have been a villain at all), I'd red-card him.  In fact, refereeing high-school in the US (just a guess from "cleated"), fighting is a zero-tolerance offense.<br>  <br>  If he sticks around for 17 years like you, I'm sure he'll learn all manner of things.  Just don't think, especially on this basis, that we ought to be encouraging him.<br>  <br>  Mark L.

b2qdwABVaa	Sometimes.  Lately he's been playing like a beast though.  I like how his brings his rebounding every game, even though he may not bring his 20+ points that he could potentially put up everynight.  As long as he gets 15+ rb a night, he's doing good out there.  Hopefully he'll keep up this pace though w/ 16/14 a night.|`|VHphDgrhaa	I don't. There must just be something about you that doesn't like people who can score and what not but don't.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	i can agree with your assumption. we know what he is capable of, but what has helped him a lot starting from half way last year, he finally let go of all the trouble that kept him down is his life. losing his kid and grandma(who took care of him and raised him). he is not coming off the bench anymore and has stepped up as of late though. i love that. ever since bynum's injury, he hasn't had a bad game, except for maybe 1. the first game when kobe scored 61 on the knicks. but even then, not his fault. he is a good player. keep doing your thing L.O.|`|vFthoB6Haa	me!!! when he was with the clippers i thought he would be one of the best in the nba with his size and skills...too bad he didn't reach his full potential! i honestly think he plays too soft..he could play like amare if he wants to but i dont think he plays physical and loves hitting from the outside..he got a pretty nice touch though.|`|gM0pk41jaa	He's a slacker.

Y4mz8BShaa	Bad choice of websites<br>  <br>  Optics aren't accurate. Weapons and humans are accurate.<br>  <br>  You can't compare a laser and a scope, and both of those are terrible quality. That scope will probably fall apart when you pick it up.<br>  <br>  Why lasers are useless:<br>  Unless you get a high quality laser and are using it correctly in low light conditions at close range, you may as well not even have one.<br>  Hard to find quality ones.<br>  Difficult to zero, and to hold zero.<br>  Give away your position.<br>  You aren't going to see that tiny *** dot past 10 metres, if you can even see it there.<br>  <br>  You're better off with your iron sights. You can't improve on something so simple.|`|cXgN6pmaaa	the laser would be most accurate at short distances but for longer range shots the scope would be far better|`|rzomCffbaa	accuracy comes down to how well you sight them in and how accurate you are as a shooter. you also have to think about the weight of those plastic bb's. i know everytime i shoot my gun the plastic bb will carry the same path for a lil and then it would get that hook at the end where it curves a different direction every time. to be honest i would recomment the laser and possibly buying higher density bullets if your gun can handle it. thats what i did|`|QL9h2fT0aa	a lazer would be better 4 short distences and 4 rifels and/or macine gun . the scope would work better for long distance snipers and rifls.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think that any of the former WWE Superstars who are now in TNA might consider moving back to WWE when their contracts expire, like Kurt Angle, Team 3D and Rhino for instance.All four wrestlers are very talented and were popular during their time in WWE and if they re-signed, would be valuable assets to WWE.|`|dcNT65mTaa	I think you might see a few who had success coming back but as far as TNA originals coming to WWE, no.

8qZrlz07aa	The rotor size is the diameter of the brake rotor and not the fork.  Your fork needs to be specifically designed for 210mm rotors to take the extra stresses these large diameter brakes can induce.<br>  <br>  Larger brake rotor, larger surface area for the brake pads to contact.  This means more stopping power, more resistance to fade and ability to more safely stop heavier weights.  <br>  <br>  Generally you will see 210mm rotors on downhill bikes or tandems.  Regular mountain bikes don't need 210mm rotors unless you fall in the Clydesdale class.  (big and heavy).  160mm rotors are just great for nearly everyone.  <br>  <br>  I have 160mm rotors on my mountain bikes but have 210mm rotors on my tandem due to the weight of me, the stoker and the trailer we haul on occasion.

All pistols are hand held<br>  2. You can get a Glock, Taurus, Ruger, etc.  $600 is more than enough money.<br>  3. Seriously?  If you can't figure out where to buy a gun, you aren't smart enough to own one.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Go to a local gun shop. You will see there are dozens of handguns for $600 or less. Both semi-autos and revolvers in 9mm parabellum, .40 S&W, .357 Magnum, .45 Auto.<br>  <br>  I recommend a double action revolver in .357 Magnum with a 4-6" barrel for a novice or anyone who doesn't have the time and funds to shoot 50-100 rounds at least every 2 months in practice to maintain skills and muscle memory. That's after a couple hundred rounds to get generally familiar with the weapon and adjust the sights plus with any autoloader at LEAST 200 rounds fired of the defensive use load to verify the reliabilty of the individual pistol/ammo combo. A .357 revolver allows you to shoot .38 Special ammo for practice(some .357 Mag every practice session or so is good if you use full power ammo) and you can use any of the good .38 Special+P defensive loads in it if the full power .357 is a bit much. Anyone who knows what they are doing is very well equipped with a revolver no matter what the people who love spray & pray with hi-cap autos say. <br>  <br>  <br>  See how the various designs feel in your hands then when you have a couple of models you really like figured out. Go to a local range that rents guns(assuming there is one) and try those models out to see if any one of them feels better then the rest when actually using it.  If you like one brand/model over all the others buy that one. <br>  <br>  I also would strongly suggest taking a handgun safety class & (at least at some point) a concealed carry class. These are good for anyone even someone who's been around guns their whole life or someone with no intentions of carrying. Everyone should know how to safely handle a firearm the same as every driver should know how to parallel park a car even if they never plan to do it.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	Best bet for Home Defense is actually a short barreled shotgun.  Go to a reputable gun shop (even better, one attached to a range) and talk to the guy at the counter.  Don't go to a big box sports store as they don't know squat about guns; stick with the pros.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a Mossberg 500 Tactical 6-Shot.  It has the shorter 18.5" barrel, a collapsible stock for either shoulder firing or quick hip shots (not recommended).  It is a weapon designed for close quarter combat and will do the job!  And it is less than 600 bucks.  Use the extra money to buy some 00 Buck ammo and go practice.|`|LWxmRKnnaa	I suggest you go to your local gun shop and hold some of their guns. See which ones you like around your price range. Then let off a couple of round in each gun if possible which is what they do in my area. Make sure you do some research online and ask your gun buddies about the pistol before u go ahead and buy it. <br>  <br>  The main things to look out for when buying a pistol is accuracy, comfort, and reliability, not to mention ammunition availability and price these days haha.<br>  <br>  I would take a friend with me that knows a bit about firearms before purchasing any pistol especially if it's second hand.|`|h6y25GSBaa	try buds gun shop<br>  <a href="http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/advanced_cat_search.php?cated=26&manufacturers_id=&ITATR_list%5B1%5D=1717&ITATR_list%5B2%5D=&ITATR_list%5B3%5D=&ITATR_list%5B4%5D=&ITATR_list%5B5%5D=&ITATR_list%5B6%5D=&ITATR_list%5B7%5D=&ITATR_list%5B8%5D=&ITATR_list%5B9%5D=&ITATR_list%5B0%5D=" rel="nofollow">http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/advan...</a><br>  they have a whole lot of guns that can be used for self defense you just have to take your pick.|`|SAaHhrNuaa	You should be able to get what you want for that price ,that is about what a hand gun cost.Go on Cabelas web site and check pricing there.|`|AA12211483	whatever ya wanted.

LA Lakers - Kobe Bryant has come alive, leading his Lakers to the best record in the NBA and defeating the Boston Celtics 92-83 in late December. They've also won six straight.<br>  <br>  2. Boston Celtics - Still a powerhouse, but dropping some games lately. They've won just six of their last ten, which isn't typical for them.<br>  <br>  3. Cleveland Cavaliers - They've been tough all season and are making a case for LeBron James to sign an extension.<br>  <br>  4. Orlando Magic - Dwight Howard is officially the best center in the NBA.<br>  <br>  5. San Antonio Spurs - They've quietly climbed their way back into relevance after losing several key players to injury earlier in the season.<br>  <br>  6. New Orleans Hornets - They're still finding themselves this season. They don't have the energy they had last season. Yet, Chris Paul is good enough to carry them for now.<br>  <br>  7. Atlanta Hawks - Mike Bibby gives them a whole new dimension and Joe Johnson has capitalized the most.<br>  <br>  8. Detroit Pistons - They've won seven straight and are starting to figure out how to play with Allen Iverson. Though, Rodney Stuckey is fast emerging as their best guard.<br>  <br>  9. Denver Nuggets - Chauncey Billups was a better fit for Denver than Iverson ever was, but Denver hasn't proven that they can hang with the other top teams of the league on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  10. Phoenix Suns - Shaquille O'Neal is showing he still has some juice left in the tank and has helped carry the squad with Steve Nash out with injury|`|nukqnS6Eaa	Right now the Boston celtics in the past the LA Lakers,Before that the Chicago Bulls before that..the Lakers again|`|a8yDDprlaa	The Lakers.

Easy reason: best record in NBA. They beat both the cavs and celtics in the same weekend. Don't forget they are the only team to beat the cavs at their own home. They beat Boston twice. Lakers have the deepest bench with Ariza and Farmar and how Powell is play great too. Boston is not the same with out PJ Brown and Posey. Cavs needed to make one good trade to be better than Lakers but the trade deadline is past. Lakers are the best team in the NBA <br>  WOOT WOOT!!!|`|qu2kBYkAaa	as of rite now i have to say the Lakers.<br>  -no major injures except for bynum<br>  -they are still doing very well without bynum <br>  -other players than kobe are contributing consistently<br>  -kobe is the best finisher in the league<br>  -and all the bench players have finally got enough experience|`|YSkRoVxTaa	Season 08-09<br>  Lakers are in the first place right now<br>  <br>  1 - L.A.

ZKikquiOaa	of all the archery shops I've dealt with, the cheapest prices I've found is at these two shops<br>  <br>  www.k1-archery.com<br>  www.altservices.biz<br>  <br>  I'm partial to K1, since the owner is my buddy, plus he's also a target shooter so he knows what he's talking about.<br>  <br>  The Hoyt Eclipse is a great riser, but be sure the you like the tec style riser before you buy it.  See if there are other archers in the area who own one.  I own a Hoyt Helix and I love it, but I've heard of people complaining about the riser being too stiff and the tec bridge hitting their arm when they shoot.<br>  <br>  Other option around that price point is the Win & Win Winact, or the Winstar 2.  The Samick Athlete is also a great riser but at a higher price point.  Hoyt also makes another riser that looks darn good, but they're only available in 21" and 23" models.  Called the Excell, it's brand new for 2009, so if you draw length is less than 27" you can look at that one.<br>  <br>  Limbs, I like Samick limbs, but I've heard nothing but praises for the new PSE Xpression limbs, they're cheap and smooth.  I've pulled the limbs but never shot it, they are good limbs.

y5TTkgFYaa	Many ways.  Put some balls on the felt, and rock n fire.|`|D9CtEDHPaa	YES.,<br>  <br>  scatter billiards ball in the table then try to shot as many ball as you can.,it help you to build your pocketing more successful|`|dbmIsbucaa	I used to always play right handed versus left handed. The practice really helps when you get those hard shots that you have to stretch or use a bridge for, if you can shoot with either hand you don't have to worry anymore. Also yahoo search the game "Bowliards" it keeps score like bowling and is tons of fun.|`|JGjwHrqAaa	Yes throwing the balls on the table works but gets boring real quick. Often it does not even help your game because u lose interest. What u need to do is set goals. Shooting 9 ball by yourself works but too often u lose interest trying to run them all. I like to shoot drills. Short ones so I don't lose intrest and I get better because I'm always concentrating. Can u run 3 balls? Most people will say of course. But put the 1,2 and 3 on the table. Place the 1 on the spot and the 2 and 3 behind it like a triangle. A mini rack. Then break them and u have one chance to run all 3 after the break. The goal is to do this 10 times. Who care if u can't do it at all. But mark down how u did. Ok u did it 2 out of 10 times. Your score is 20 percent. Do 2 sets of 10 in a row. Mark it down. I bet in 2 weeks ur game will improve. And u will enjoy this. 3 balls keeps your attention so u stay focused. Maybe in a week u will make 4 out of 10 and so on. Once u reach 70 percent u will be able to beat 95 percent of the players in pool halls. When u play 9 ball u can look at it after like 3 games of 3 ball in one. It really helps. Good luck. Add me if u want. I can give u lots of other games or whatever|`|8ThsMGueaa	Well of course you can!  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just set up like a normal game!|`|8kTCCKadaa	You can play pocket pull (pool if you prefer), just put your hand in your pocket and......
