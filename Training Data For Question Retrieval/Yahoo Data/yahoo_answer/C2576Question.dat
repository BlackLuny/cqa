As a result of this my car kind of spun out of control and mounted a kerb.      What happened was I was on a roundabout turning right when all of a sudden the car decides to go left (because of all the snow in the road). I tried desperately to steer it straight but the car just went skitzo and I went up a kerb.      When driving it after I notice that the the steering wasn't straight. The steering wheel would be lined up to go in a straight line but it would veer to the right.      Any diagnosis as to what may have happened? It may be an obvious answer but I am clueless when it comes to the mechanics of a car.

20090225052309AAc0lt3	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Pontiac	Having Power Window Issues With 1999 Pontiac Grand Am?	Hi everyone! I have a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am With Power Window Issues? My Grand Am is a great car, does not eat up too much fuel, and only has 105K miles on it. The problem exists with the power windows, specifically the back power windows. A couple of weeks ago they started refusing to go up when I or someone in the backseat hit the "windows up" button. We pulled the window up by hand and tried them again, and same thing occurred. So to sum up, they roll down fine like good little windows, but refuse to roll up, like evil little windows. Since the problem happens to both backseat windows on opposite sides of the car, I'm thinking it might have to do with a wiring problem, maybe at a spliced location a wire has gone bad. The fuse inside the car has been checked and is good. I hope some of you fabulous geniuses out there can help my wife and me solve this, 'cause it's driving us nuts! Any help would be greatly appreciated. One more thing, I'm fairly good at crawling around cars and under engines, and could certainly engage in a do-it-yourself process, but solving the equation is no doubt way above my pay scale. Any help would be most welcome! Thanks

I have a 2001 Ford ZX2 with automatic transmission.

20090203143637AAnnFBp	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	How do you determine who's at fault?	Borrowed my roommate's car today (I don't have my own, but I've had a license for years w/ no accidents), was going through an intersection (I had looked both ways twice before proceeding), and a car that was speeding coming from my left hit my driver's side headlight and tore off the front bumper. His passenger side headlight was smashed up.       I found out my roommate had let his insurance policy expire and hadn't updated it.       Am I automatically at fault for being in a car w/o insurance?       I have a witness that told the cop the other guy just tore up the road and slammed into me, as far as road laws go, would I be at fault since he had the right-of-way, or would he be at fault because he was speeding (really fast) and I had no reasonable time in order to stop?      I think I'm royally screwed here, and just want to know what I might be in for. I'm in California.

I bought  one and it did not help anything so then I replaced the other one.  That code went away but then I got a code saying the system was too lean, now it is saying the system is too rich.  My father is telling me to take it to a dealer to get it scanned but they want to charge me 150 dollars to do it so I thought I would ask here first.    When I go around 50 mph and 70 the car starts to "chug"  like it is skipping or something and I would almost compare the feeling of having a stereo really loud.  The car slightly bounces.  It is a 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass.    My father seems to think it may be a wiring problem or that one of the O2 sensors may not be working   Any Ideas?

I paid with one check, so they were mad because they wanted to raise the price with a warranty. So they sent me to a financer anyway and I reluctantly signed for a warranty (I asked if I could think about it and he said they couldn't offer it later). So less then 2 hours later I ask to cancel and he says I have 30 days. I decided not to wait and I tried calling and I couldn't get connected with anyone. So I went in and had to fill out a form to cancel. They said the warranty company would send me a check in 3-6 weeks. So earlier this week I got that check.    Now, a couple dys ago I get a check from the dealer for $2,347 and I have no idea why. It says "VSC refund flat cancel due customer on 04 hyndai tiburon purchased 12-29-08 never billed"      My question is: why did I get this check, and should I deposit it?
