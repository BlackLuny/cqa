RmwVC33Waa	You feel like the most unlucky person, well, check this out; I'm 18, I've just been kicked out of school, I'm so poor, I cant pay for my fees, my parents are dead, they died of AIDS, I,ve no where to go, my friends isolate me coz they think I'm also HIV+. All my relatives are gone. I wish I could die. Now who's the unlucky person. (Just kidding)   My main point is; whenever we get problems, we really think we are the only one in the world goin through those stuff. But we forget that, there are others goin through harder circumstances than us.   Start concentrating on the things u have, rather than the things u don't have. That's the key to happiness. U are not unlucky at all. Trust me and believe it; U ARE THE LUCKIEST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD.|`|5tqnGVlLaa	alright....when u r feeling down, moody, depress, sad, etc, u r like vibrating a negative energy to ppl around. do u like to be around ppl with negative energy?    stop focusing on the NO n learn to see things the other way round. every time u thought of any unhappy things in your life, ask yourself  [what are the things that makes me smile/happy/amused etc, today?]    the more u focus on a thing (especially negative stuff, we tend to be blinded by our self. we only see what we want to/what we r telling our self coz u been telling yourself how bad n how unlucky u r.)|`|NxwSdiBGaa	Love your self...  feel like Princes...that's what you are....

Why does anyone not like in the family--sit and think, change your ways.  Why no good friend.  I am a good guy.  Can I be your friend?  Good job--get experience and keep moving, keep hunting.

Negativity is the more seductive or easier way whilst discipline of the mind takes work. Street smarts is not sophisticated formally educated people and rarely is any truth in the streets.

We should stop sending them food, medicine and money immediately.|`|rpajoT0raa	Can they? Well, yes. They are. It's part and parcel of civilisation and prosperity. And the oppression of people in the third world should be objected to and remedied so that they may experience equal rights under the laws of their countries too. Whose job is it to change the world on their own, though?     For some constructive discussion of your question, it would help if you provided some sources and examples for your assertion that women in the first world benefit so much from third world oppression. Thank you.    Edit-  Now you're changing course. The list of examples of third world oppression IS indeed long... but HOW do women in the first world benefit from it? Which examples should they be ashamed of so much, as to bring their claims for their own equal rights into question?|`|AA11589988	The hypocrisy is even closer to home for first world feminists.

By your reasoning, we are all oppressing third world countries.  How, by the way?|`|wRLidVqkaa	Us little people have no power, I am sure if you could you would do anything you could. Just reading what happens to men and women in Dafur if they do not comply; it's not us it's our Government that allows the feudal, idyllic relations. It's bound us all to our "natural superiors" it's left us all with nothing more than self-interest, callous 'cash payment.' It's nothing more than philistine sentimentalism merged with egotistical calculation. We the people should band together!    The Government have resolved personal worth into exchange value, an in place of numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up an unconscionable freedom - Free Trade. Which promotes nothing but exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it is shameless, direct exploitation. Because not only can they rich get richer, but now they can wear clothes and drink tea from the pain and hardship of little people who have no hope of Revolution right now! We don't need to fight people, we need to fight conglomerates and privatisation! Because this is what is dehumanising us! We have to stand together!    I would like to add out of the 22 western Countries that send aid, America is 22nd. That was with Bush in power, lets hope America can actually start to give back.    Edit: David I have been in Dafur, I have been to Central Africa I have done what I can with what little I have. This can not be resolved overnight, with every civil war. With every revolt and malitia. Don't you say I have done nothing! I gave my life for 3 years with my mother. We did many things that were burned to the ground, we did what we could; I want to do more. But don't you dare say we never tried, especially when as soon as you open something good and new for them it is destroyed. For someone who hasn't seen the babies and people die infront of you, the fact you make it about you; about this 'world' when this is a global issue. I did all I could but the malitia are funded, and the people are scared. I held babies in my arms and watched them die, because people want some money! In most Countries it isn't about who holds a "JOB" it's about differing religious belief and tribal! In Togo the women are the primary killers because men are seen better at staying with the young, they are working out better then Africa, where it is all tribal and political. You know nothing of the world, so don't mouth off about it.    Also it is just the men with missing limbs in Africa?? Women get their breasts cut off, women fight in wars because they have to! Women are just as broken as men and so are 6 7 8 year old children. You David are a liar, a petty liar with personal excuse.|`|s9aTmNHQaa	Opression in the 'third world' is caused firstly, by its own country. Women (or men) of the 'First World' are not responsible for that opression, and should not be held accountable for it, and should not be made to feel guilty for it.  Of course men can be feminists, it is a way of thinking not a gender specific issue.|`|ro7JSflXaa	The living conditions in the 3rd world expose the fact that feminists really don't care about anyone but themselves.    EVERYONE in those countries (men, women, children, especially the old and sick) suffer horribly but feminists  act as if the men and boys are living in luxury while the women are suffering.    I work in the 3rd world, along with caring people from the UN, USAID, and many NGOs to try to stabilize and develop impoverished war torn nations.    If you spend even a day in parts of Africa, you will see that it's mostly young men who have the missing limbs and are crippled from the civil wars and it's the unemployed, desperate men that end up causing more civil strife.    I see first hand every day, that if young men especially especially young men have decent jobs those governments and societies will stabilize and develop, because they would rather work a job than fight with warlords.   Trust me, as long as the young men are unemployed, poor and desperate, nothing will change.   You cannot ignore men and expect the society to stabilize.  It will not happen.    As long as fighting age men remain unemployed and angry, the 3rd world will ALWAYS be the 3rd.  But, rich western feminists really don't care.    Eloka D -     Simple fact: everything in the 3rd world is about poverty.  Without poverty, it's not the 3rd world.  Without poverty, criminal warlords can't so easily get thousands of young, illiterate or unemployed men to fight for them.    Without poverty, they can't capitalize on the anger, frustration, and hopelessness which are fertilized in poverty, enabling oppression and corruption.  The fruitage born is endless war, violence, and cyclic inhumanity and anarchy.      See the big picture and you'll get it.     btw, while you're warm and cozy in the suburbs last week,  I burying a friend who was poisoned.
oYSDEWrfaa	From my female perspective, when I am feeling a little blue or not that good about myself I usually take time out for a "me" day. This would consist of a day that I do a bunch of small things to pamper myself such as get a hair cut, get my nails done (or take time to do them myself), a long bubble bath, maybe some shopping, as well as get a little organized. The organization part would be cleaning up my room, organizing my closet, and possibly writing a to do list.     By getting a new hair cut and taking time out for me I feel better about myself. Sometimes I have to force myself to dress up when im down and after I do i usually feel a little better throughout my day.     Another thing I sometimes do is put on some good music and/or do some journal writing about what's going on in my life while setting up some goals.     Best wishes~|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Start implementing positivity into your life. So doing the things that you enjoy, whatever your hobbies are, attain them into your life.

N2jwOfcwaa	The origin of fear/ or lack of confidence, is Insecurity.  If you keep thinking all the time and don't do anything to feel good about yourself, proud about yourself, this condition will stay with your mind.  Take action on the things you think you SHOULD do. That's the only way. You might fail but there will still be a consolation in your mind that you TRIED.  Wondering and analyzing about yourself is only going to make it worse.  Try to be a little bold if you want to live life to its fullest.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	You sound like my husband.  I am very strong, straight forward, social person.  My husband is as you put it, a doormat.  Being that I can't stand doormats and their mentality, I simply forced him in to my social situations and in the course of a year he has changed dramatically.  So, my best suggestion is to force yourself.  Once you realize that the sky won't fall if you stand up for yourself, and that people really aren't looking at you, and that it's okay to say NO, before you know it you'll be laughing at yourself for ever wasting your life away being a hermit.

DtotNQ3oaa	Low land is the most fertile so people settled there.Over time natural processes like rain,storms ,earthquakes move soil from higher altitudes and cover cities and settlements and all signs of cultures.But just as lower areas fill in high land cultures uncover and are exposed naturally,usually graves,cave dwellings.I saw a place where archaeologist found well preserved people in a high and dry area just sitting up the exact way they were placed,very odd to see.|`|956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	Not all of them are buried.  In the American west, for instance, we don't dig when we're looking for sites.  We can just walk over the ground and see where they are because the artifacts are just laying there.    There are a lot of reasons that sites get buried.  Flooding's one of them; here in the eastern States, I've even come across last year's Coke cans a couple of yards down because we were digging in a flood plain.  Water moves a lot of dirt around.  Erosion's another reason.  A site at the top of a hill will be exposed, but the bottom's where the dust goes.  Plowing's another big reason.  That's why we have to dig in the eastern States; ain't nowhere flat enough to make camp that hasn't been plowed at least once.  In that case, we're not digging to get to the site; we're just digging to get to the undisturbed portion of it.  There's also this nifty thing called soil turbidity, which can really affect some areas.  Basically, the natural freeze-thaw cycle every year can bury and regurgitate artifacts.  I was in an area in California last summer where a site filled with lithic tools could disappear one year and reappear the next.  Pretty cool.  And then there's just new soil being made fairly often.  You dig in a forest, where the leaves are dropped each year and the earthworms work on them, you have to dig through mulch and the last few seasons' new black soil to get to older stuff.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	they were buried by users or earth movements|`|HkMhWvtgaa	As random6x says, not all artifacts are buried.    However, I spent one summer on an archaeological dig in Israel, where things were in fact underground.  When you dug down, you went through layer after layer in time.  The deeper you dug, the older the artifacts.  Part of the reason is that ancient people did not sweep away the dust and trash that accumulated, but simply kept on living right on top of it, depositing layer upon layer.    In that part of the world, there are many sites that have been occupied more or less continuously for thousands of years.  After such long occupation, the site becomes what is called a "tel", or an artificial mound gradually built up from the discarded dirt, ash, pottery fragments, and so on of the generations of people who lived there.      Once, after I was back in the United States, I was with a person whom I had met on the archaeological dig, and we happened to drive past a modern garbage dump, with its characteristic mound shape.  I commented, "It looks like a tel."  He gave me an odd look and pointed out, "It IS a tel."    It's just that we carry our trash all to one spot, so we build up our tels outside of our living area, and we build them more quickly because we concentrate the refuse from miles around all in one spot.    Future archaeologists are going to LOVE those garbage dumps!  They will know more about our lives than modern archaeologists can know about the past.  They may even curse recycling.  (Not that I'm saying we should stop recycling just to make future archaeologists' jobs easier.)

And, we will tend to reject those who don't align themselves in the same manner as we do.    But, you seem to be implying that moral codes are only guidelines which people can choose to ignore anytime it is convenient or expeditious for them, personally.    And, you are correct, to a point.  To me, there does exist an acceptable range of moral correctness and belief.  As long as we remain within those culturally mandated boundaries, we are fine.  But, if we choose to venture into areas which are deemed repugnant, illegal or just plain wrong, we do so at our own risk.

oZPLI8Y5aa	Evolution is about survival and reproducing the characteristics resulting in survival - there is no end point unless you consider immortality which is essentially impossible. Even protons eventually break down|`|956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	There's no ultimate target of evolution, particularly the natural kind.  Animal husbandry projects have a target, but nature doesn't.  We're also not the peak stage of animal development.  Chimps, for instance, are just as evolved if not more so than we are.  Bacteria are actually more evolved than us, since their lifespan is so short; they go through more mutations quicker than we'd ever manage.    We might think we're super-evolved because of our big brains, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  It's worked out well for us, but most creatures don't need or want to be brainy.  Brains take up a lot of energy that can often be better spent on other things.  The bacteria are doing great, without even a central nervous system.  No animal's going to evolve a big brain unless the survival advantages outweigh the negatives.  And that'd be a reason that we'll never evolve to not need food, at least with the brains we've got now.  Too much energy required.  The animals that don't eat much, like snakes and other reptiles, tend not to be particularly brainy.  What's more, human societies wouldn't really support the disappearance of food and food-based rituals.  Even in western society, which now has an incredibly f-up relationship to food (hello, rising anorexia rates and moral authorities who want us all on low calorie diets), those rituals are very important to solidify family and community bonds.  Just think of Thanksgiving.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	No.    It's not true that humans are a "peak stage" of animal development.    Living things need energy; animals eat food or die.    Sorry, but what you wrote is just nonsense.|`|E1wGuCavaa	Evolution has no "target" or "endpoint".  It just continues blindly, making organisms ever more adapted to fit their particular environments.  And no organism could live without taking in outside material.  Whether they do it by photosynthesis or by ingesting other organisms, they still need "food".

While many artists and composers such as Claude Monet and Mozart are commonly thought to have had eidetic memory, it is possible that their memories simply became highly trained in their respective fields of art, as they each devoted large portions of their waking hours towards the improvement of their abilities    Some individuals with autism display extraordinary memory, including those with related conditions such as Asperger's syndrome. Autistic savants are a rarity but they, in particular, show signs of spectacular memory. However, most individuals with a diagnosis of autism do not possess eidetic memory.    Some people attribute exceptional powers of memory to enhanced memory techniques as opposed to any kind of innate difference in the brain.

Bi51WJd7aa	No, it doesn't make you a bad person. At least you don't see women as sexual objects and you show the interest and desire in wanting to see more in and know them authentically. I suppose it's something that a lot of men struggle with. As long as you still have respect for females and see them as human beings, it's okay. You're still young and through time, with wisdom and maturity, you should hopefully start to evolve in thought with regards to how you interact, engage with and think about women.  It's refreshing for a lady like myself to see, that it's something you acknowledge though :)    All the best of luck!|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Men are geared toward reproduction.

abf3ebca4c87098ec5e1b42a5f4963b3aa	First, it's good that you are considering seeing your counselor later ... hopefully that provide you an outlet for your feeling shitty today and, at the same time, provides some solace for your thinking.    It may be beneficial for you to pause and reflect on why you feel shitty today and, perhaps, did not fel shitty yesterday.    In my view, our feeling of well-being (or not-so-well-being) get triggered by stimuli (events, people, places, memories, and the like) and we often walk around feling like "I don't know why I feel this way" and allow the "feeling" to wrest control from us.  In other words, the "feeling" is not recognized as having "roots" somewhere and instead of assessing anc considering what may have precipitated that feeling, we instead go through the day with the feeling in the driver's seat.    Please know that I am not minimizing your feelings or the trauma associated with sexual abuse.  You were -and remain- a victim of a heinous crime and no amount of words -or even time- may diminish the pain and suffering that accompanies that violation of you.  You are a victim.    As such, I can only hope that you are not also feeling guilty about what happened years ago (as that often is a by-product of being victimized, that is, we tend to feel as if we may -somehow- have contributed to the abuse).  If that is the case, then it needs the light of day -and the dialogue of therapy or counseling- to be controled and ameliorated.    At a minimum, I believe it is important to try and determine what brought on the shitty feeling and focus on those triggers in order to better be able to control (diminish or even eradicate) the possibilities for those triggering events to continue presenting in your life.    And finally, please know that "our feelings" are normal -for us at any given moment.  With that said, we must also attend to the fact that our feelings can wreck havoc with our life ... especially those feelings that tend to paralyze us, that is, cause us to stop problem-solving and making decisions.  At that point then our feelings -whatever they may be- are in control and that, to me, is worthy of concern.    Engage the dialogue with your counselor, your confidants, and your loved ones ....|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Unless you can close the door on your past it will be with you forever.

You are not broken or damaged goods. And life will appear sweeter and better. Continue on with your counseling and be honest and open with him/her. This will allow the healing to begin. It is also helpful to at some point forgive, not forget the individual that harmed you in such horrible manner and took away your innocence and security. Not forget, simply forgive so your healing can begin. I personally believe that the speaking "aloud" of the experience is a very powerful tool in the healing process. It happened, it is a part of who you are, it does not however define you; you can heal and recover. I wish you the best.|`|tqyqMvJIaa	yea! something happened to you thats NEVER gunna go away. thats why when something like that happens its better to get counseling earlier instead of waiting and hiding your feelings. because its gotta come out eventually or its just gunna build up. i know how you feel im in your postion to.|`|y5qZRyLraa	Yeah, I was like that.

Often a form of projection or displacement is created and we tend to blame ourselves even more. The counselor you are mentioning, "I" hope is a competent person in psychological therapy. There will be many unconscious repressions and these need to be sorted out and shown how to accept the new self.

fDGPbwdsaa	Absolutely - but note, the state now pressures mother's to give names, even when they (the mom) doesn't want to because she is happy with the current arrangement.    e.g.    When I split from my long term relationship, she used to let the kids come over very frequently. I used to pay her quite handsomely out of my poor wage.     Due to some change in her situation she had to reapply for certain benefits - in the paperwork it explains that if they do not seek C$A they may not be entitled to certain benefits.    When I called the C$A to ask about this, they *claimed* my ex had filed to have C$A take control.    I told the lying woman directly she was talking $hit and that the paperwork forces mothers - using blackmail - to give names.    I went on to tell her that we had our own agreement and we were both happy with it.    "I give her what I can, and I keep some to sepnd on the kids"     She didn't like it.

I would also try to be in the child's life as much as I could|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Whilst I myself would have no issue with DNA tests at birth, I think there would probably people who were in outrage at it.   For example people hate the government interfering to much with their lives, imagine how paranoid people would get about these DNA tests. It probably would not be long until the media suggested that the government was using them to spy on people etc.   And some people would probably rather not knowing if their child was theirs or not - ignorance is bliss. Others might feel DNA tests go against their religion.  Plus imagine the amount this would cost the government each year. There would probably be an outcry against tax money being spent on these DNA tests at birth. Which would be a waste since the majority of tests will come out as expected.  I guess men (and the few women who pay child support too) don't get offended by child support because we are used to it. It has become just another one of those things people have to go through if parents separate. Because we are used to it we realize it is nothing personal. Perhaps if DNA testing became a standard procedure in separation eventually we would get used to it and not be offended. But people always will be offended by the initial change.    Maybe it makes more sense that everyone is put on child support so everyone is in the same boat, otherwise it may seem like you are judging them. Its a bit like saying the good ones can sort it out by themselves but the bad ones are put on child support. This would make it an even greater insult to those who are put on child support. Especially since there are grey areas, not everyone can be categorised into the type who are willing and reliable and the type who will try to shirk responsibilities.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	It's not the ex's decision to make. Legally, the non-custodial parent has to pay child support no matter what.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I don't think women should be offended at the idea when a man asks for DNA evidence to prove whether or not he is the father of the woman's child, especially if the woman has her fill of sex partners and doesn't always use protection. You asked a difficult question and it is hard to answer. A majority of men do not get offended when a woman orders child support through the courts because most men can man up to their responsibilities and pay whatever little pittance to help their children. There are some scoundrels who do not pay up and refuse to accept responsibility for their children and it is they who are giving the majority of men a bad name. Which is why they are called "deadbeat dads."|`|n0nqLAshaa	Because they really really really like that money for having a bastard child. An I mean bastard in the literal sense.

yX4xVukPaa	As you've correctly pointed out the section 2 offence of Rape can only be committed by a male because it requires penile penetration.     The section 3 offence (assault by penetration) is a distinct offence, but carries the same potential maximum sentence (in a way somewhat comparable to ABH s47 vs GBH s20 - both carry the same maximum sentence, but are technically distinct offences).    The distinction between the 2 offences is probably of marginal importance when it comes to sentencing.     Having look at the consultation document which lead to the 2003 act ( http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/v... ) the reasoning to do with rape and gender neutrality can be found at 2.8.4 on page 15 (34 in the .pdf). Basically, rape before the 2003 act *was* essentially a male-only crime, and the fundamentally reason for not expanding the definition to include the stuff in assault by penetration was that the public think of rape as a male only crime...    In my opinion it's a little weak, in an age when gender equality is heavily legislated for. However, the significance is largely symbolic since it is the facts of any particular offence determine sentence much more than the particular charge.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Sounds pretty clear to me. I think everyone is getting upset because it says "he", but in formal writing "he" can be used to mean "he or she". And it does leave room for female rapists to be penalized, as it mentions use of an object or any body part.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I'm surprised to see that as written law.     Is that actually used to define it in court? Would they just toss a case of anyone being raped unless the one who was accused were a man?    I can't believe that would be true. I think this must just be an oversight.    If in the UK only men can be charged and jailed for rape, that's insane =o/|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It has a predictable "only men can do bad" message written within it.    Technically, this means a woman cannot ever commit a sexual crime.      And you'll note, not one feminist will be complaining about sexism within this legal document - because it benefits women (sweeps their misdeeds under the rug, out of sight).|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think that about covers it. It's similar to the Australian one AFAIK but not as concise. Actually the Australian version is a bit weird because I think technically it could be rape if you penetrated a mouth with any object. Oh yeah and oral on a woman without penetration isn't included either. In the UK one it doesn't seem to have any rape for a male by a female (not penetrating the male) which is weird. I don't know enough about it though to really comment on that.    The use of the word "he" is done throughout all the UK statutes (rather unfairly I think) so it's not just here. Check out any other law.    Harriet|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Sheesh, Canadian legislators neutralized that one years ago. (And might I add that feminists were at the forefront of getting rid of the "women can't rape" language.) Where have the Brits been all this time?|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Obviously, "he" is used here to imply "the person," either male or female, as it always has by English grammatical  standards. It's funny that when some feminists complain that the standard English usage of "he" is sexist, the anti-fems accuse them of whining about nothing, and not understanding the English language, but when it is used in such a manner, the first thing they say is "he," in this context is sexist. Hmmm...    Perhaps this sort of confusion is what made feminists complain in the first place? Obviously, even anti-feminists are confused by it, but it's only a problem when the connotations are negative.    BTW, the wording is gender neutral in the US as well. You can thank the feminists for that.      EDIT--Obviously. But then it goes on to state that "he" could insert objects, other body parts, ect. A woman does not need a penis for this. Further down, it refers to "causing sexual activity without consent." Rather odd phrasing, but women clearly fall into this category . See here:    (c) penetration of a persons anus or vagina with a part of Bs body or by B with anything else, or    (d) penetration of a persons mouth with Bs penis    "B" here is the victim. Clearly this states that a man can be the victim, and a woman the rapist.      EDIT-But it says (paraphrasing) that "A" must penetrate THEIR (A's) body with "B's" penis. "A" is the rapist, "B" is the victim. Clearly, this describes a situation where a woman  can force a man to penetrate her, right?     But I see what you're saying here...while it does address the fact that men can be victims and women perpetrators (and it clearly does), it apparently is NOT considered "rape" when a woman forces a man to penetrate her. It is apparently considered a form of sexual assault. I'm not sure of the reasoning behind this (is it simply semantics, or something more?), BUT the biggest issue here would be whether or not a woman forcing a man to penetrate her, and a man forcibly penetrating a woman are liable for the same sentence. I can't tell from what is written.|`|BDhTLlXgaa	seems to ignore the fact that women can and have raped also     otherwise its pretty clear on its meaning
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Ok there are good things about this and bad things. Firstly it is ok to be aware of your surroundings and the people around you. It could actually save your life. It is much better to be this way than to wander around not noticing anything and inviting trouble. But then again you cant let fear incapacitate you either and that is what you are starting to do. If you are in the USA I would suggest you getting some pepper spray or a tazer so that you can alleiviate your anxiety if people come close to you when you are alone. Having a means of defense will help you relax and see each situation for what it is not what you fear it could be. If you are home alone you will also have that means of defense and if you check the doors and windows and make sure they are locked that will also help. If you are in a store choose an aisle or place where you can stand side on. It is not a matter of you making things up in your head. The threat can be real but probably isnt. However if you have a means of defense and can control the situation somewhat I am sure you will feel better about being alone. If you cant or dont have that means you will have to find ways to allieviate your anxiety like going to a friends house or having one stay over if you have to be home alone and making an action plan with your mother so that if someone breaks into the house you can let them know. Sit your mother down and explain to her that you are having panic attacks and need her help. I hope she listens and you can get some help with this but dont let it take over your life.|`|AA10390256	I feel the say way but i feel like im goin to die cuz i dont here my heart beating.....

There are a plenty of ignorant and bigoted people in this section of Yahoo Answers who will never understand your faith and how it can affect your everyday life.

So be positive :-)    Are there any government funded or charity employment agencies in your city you could approach to have your skills and employment credentials assessed? Some deal specifically with people who have been out of the workforce for some time, and make extra effort for them    Here in Australia some of the large charities run these types of agencies and they are Christian, but they should be very understanding of the anti-discrimination laws and should not be worried about your religion. Because it is against the employment laws to discriminate on the basis of religion.     But you should still confidently send your resume to every employment agency, particularly the ones that fill IT positions. Even if you can get a foot in the door with an administrative job in an IT company, it may lead to better things and help pay the bills for the time being.    Good luck with everything :-)    Edit-  Oh! And 33 is NOT middle-aged. Not unless you're going to die at 60. Women live much longer than that! You are young and in your prime. Get out there and be young and strong :-)|`|iHKJsyfTaa	If you have a really heavy accent,, You could do Hewlett Packard Tech support.|`|wRLidVqkaa	**** these people they are inconsiderate bastards!!

See if there are professional groups in your area that you can join for free.  You can also try doing volunteer work in the field - see if there are any local charities that need tech support, or maybe senior citizens homes or something like that.  It will give you current experience for your resume and also maybe give you a chance to make some good contacts.  At the very least you might be able to make some friends.|`|w2mBCzK3aa	no i cant

qq7h7A4Oaa	Here is what I would do. Create a fake ID... make it a big scary looking fellow, add a couple of the people on his freinds list, then add him, he will see that you have mutual friends and add you, and probly ask you how he knows you, if he does... or even if he doesnt... let him know that you know what he did to that girl... and that justice is coming.    Scare the bejeesus out of him. Make sure the picture of the guy you use as your fake scary avenger is very real looking, no staged shots, just a good scary tough looking fellow. It'll have the bloke looking behind him for a good while.    If you don't go that route... I would let all of the people on his friends list know that he is a rapist. And I would go ahead and post his page site here so that any of us can have a little fun at his expense... rapers don't deserve anonimity. They are scum.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	It really depends, rape has not become clear cut anymore.  Some guys get drunk and do stupid things and never do them again.  Others are predators, if you were a child when this happened ( I mean under the age of 14 and not just fooling around) and you think that he could be still doing things like that you can tell people. But remember gossip is something you can never take back, once you have accused someone of something that violent and this was a one time thing only you will ruin someone's reputation forever.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Tell them about it.

People need to be made aware of what this person is capable of and the fact that he raped you but I think you need to seek advice from someone professional.  The only way around this I think would be to say that you heard a rumour that he had raped someone and not name yourself as the victim as he could retaliate.  Yes people need to know to protect them but don't put yourself at further risk from this person.
2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	ARRRGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!       Why in the world is the first place you people turn to for help ALWAYS the government?!?!?       What about personal responsibility?  I know, I should be ashamed typing such a dirty dirty phrase that might offend someone's sensibilities.  I will wait for my lawsuit in the mail.       People's attitudes need to change.  The world took a turn for the worse when that stupid dork won the lawsuit about the hot coffee burning her---how could the individual purchasing the coffee possibly know that it was hot and they should be careful?  Clearly I need a million bucks for my stupidity.       It is THAT kind of dumb a$$ mentality that has made the workplace such a lawsuit riddled environment, which in turn has made everyone 'on the lookout' for inequality or discrimination or whatever the hell snake oil is hot this week       If people hired qualified candidates, regardless of gender or race or religion (the laws that are ALREADY in place), it would be fine.  But nowadays employers have to make sure they hire the woman or the chinese man or the muslim, regardless of their qualifications, because they're afraid of a lawsuit.       So I took the long way around, but the best thing the government can do to improve things between men and women in the workforce, is: stay the hell out of it|`|qPlx1Ejhaa	You mean like female teachers far outnumbering males?|`|mSaRuowKaa	First you need to identify what the inequalities are and then you can approach the issue of resolving them.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Why should the goverment do something ?

If you can't agree don't have children. In most cases the woman CHOOSES to be the one who stays home. This isn't discrimination - it's a choice the parents make. It has nothing to do with the government.
1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	It's a side effect of our higher intellect combined with our natural tendency to seek pleasure and in seeking to avoid pain.      It begins with our ability to think in the abstract.  Especially when it comes to thinking about possible future outcomes.  Our mind, our imagination, loves to play out different scenarios.  (Like a computer that runs simulations.)  Worry happens because we think (we daydream) about possible outcomes to events.  However, when we can only conceive of outcomes which are undesirable to what we want or we think those outcomes are more likely than more desirable ones, we have an emotional response.  Fear.  Which is really the root of worry.      Our emotional mind, perhaps Freud's "Id", is like a child who can't tell the difference between the real stimuli and the imagined ones of the intellect.  And like a child it believes that the monster really is in the closet without even being willing to look in the closet.      The best way to deal with worry is to deal with the focus on our thinking.  Refocus our attention on the present moment.  Worry cannot exist if we are truly "in the Now".  Accept a simple truth.  Not everything we can conceive actually happens.      By focusing our attention on the present moment, we can stop daydreaming about that which makes us worry.|`|InGWARz9aa	its a natural human emotion|`|ce9d90af4bd252d25ce81377df2eecc6aa	Thats a very good question..

ngxw9waWaa	Lending is in most cases secured against assets, the assets have profit potential, the ability to generate regular income. The government therefore secures an asset, a percentage of the profits generated and also a regular and sizeable interest payment, thus realising foreign capital for what is in comparison a nominal initial outlay. The burden of payments ensures growth of the nation is limited to within the control of the lending nation.     In a majority of cases wars and civil upheaval is incited to destabilise a nations government and destroy its natural earning resources and sites. The lending country then gains control of what is a devastated economy and a government with no internal income to house,  employ or maintain its people or their economy. Predatory politics is prevalent, power corrupts indubitably.    To add insult to injury should the foreign nations voice protest, the mob is roused via the media to complain about and I quote the publics money being given to foreigners. Upon hearing this the foreign government feeling rather beholden and indulged is silenced into a false sense of delusional gain. Many economies, including the powerful Russia were collapsed in this manner. The inexhaustible coffers of the west are filled with the blood, sweat and tears of pillaged foreigners and their nationla assets. Politics is a low and mean profession akin to prostitution, and prostitution is slightly more ethical, comparable only to the papparazzi for this questionable award..|`|pJ87narOaa	well i also want to ask the same question.

I would cut unnecessary spending within my own company and encourage others do so, as well. I would also nix all the workplace activities such as holiday parties. Sure, the employees might be a bit bummed about that but once the money was from those extra-curricular events started turning up in paychecks as bonuses, they wouldn't complain for too long.

And such huge inequality of income creates a lot of distrust and cynicism among the common workers.    Poor morale among employees is one common problem many companies have during hard economic times.  Because CEO's often ask their employees to make sacrifices, while they and other executives keep paying themselves multi-million dollar salaries and bonuses.      Poor leadership this certainly is.  And this is something many CEO's could improve upon by leading with their own example and sacrificing more of their own perks and benefits, before they ask their employees to do the same.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	I would fire all of the top level execs.

This is truly disgusting on behalf of the feminists.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think the question was really odd. This guy keeps asking it - it's a bit weird if somebody doesn't understand the nature of rape to be honest and keeps asking about it.    "Does this add to the body of evidence that modern Feminism is predicated on the hatred of men and perpetuating the notion that violent crime against men is a noble endeavor?"    No. Firstly one user's comment can't be said to represent modern feminism. Secondly, she was making a comparison. The guy was asking about a violent act against a woman and why it was bad, and she was helping him understand by comparing it to a similar violent act against a man.     Harriet|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	I'm not sure the question is that "innocent." Maybe it is, maybe the guy is young and doesn't understand, BUT there are a few trolls here (or one troll with a few accounts, "Wayne Kerr" immediately comes to mind) who have a rape fetish, and constantly post "questions" about rape scenarios. Perhaps the answerer was reacting from that.     And I don't see how she suggested male rape is "no big deal." She seems to imply that it is THE SAME, and that to know what it's like to be raped, one must imagine it happening to themselves. It's called "empathy."    Does the existence of the questions that appear here DAILY that trivialize the rape of women, and fetishize it, add to the body of evidence that men, in general, hate women and find nothing wrong with violating them in the worse way possible, and that doing so is, perhaps, a worthwhile endeavor?     No. And there you have your answer regarding feminism, if you are open minded enough to grasp it.
UAyoep38aa	Listen, if you are waiting for marriage and want someone with the same values, it's nothing wrong with that.

My view is this:    You should marry someone you love for them. Their past, or certain attributes, are less important than their actual charactor or personality. In my view, not marrying someone because they are not a virgin is like not marry them because they have a big nose.    You mention people having patience and dedication... well, actually, you can show these traits in many ways. you mean patience, dedication AND your attitude to virginity. I personally don't think verginity is a big deal either way, so would not be mcuh motivated to protect and guard it. However, I have patience, dedication and respect about things that matter to me. This is why I feel virginity is a surface issue, not one I have much respect for. But again, I would expect you to marry someone you feel comfortable with, and for you virginity seems to be a part of that. I'm just explaining the possible opinions of people who don't have respect for your views.

I'm sure she feels rather bad about what happened but dragging you through the mud is her method of "saving face".     There is nothing wrong with wanting to marry a virgin, especially considering you are a virgin yourself. I think even if someone lost their virginity already it's okay to want to marry a virgin - as long as that person is currently living as if they were a virgin again. You know, not sleeping around and stuff. The only time it's hypocritical is when you've got someone who is rather sexually active and sees nothing wrong with it, but wants to marry a virgin and not "a **** who's had many partners". That, is not so good! But you aren't like that, so it isn't 'detestable' for you to want to marry a virgin.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	No, there's nothing wrong with a virgin wanting to marry a virgin. In fact it makes sense because why would they keep their virginity if they didn't value it and wanted to share it with someone who also valued their virginity as well. I only have a problem with men wanting virgins when they themselves are not virgins. Such is the case with many Muslim men. Even in strict Muslim countries the men go to prostitutes and then they expect their wives to be virgins.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I'm torn on this. I can see the appeal of marrying a virgin especially if you are one yourself and see it as important. Mostly I only disagree with men who have that view when they think women should be virgins on marriage but not themselves.    But I can also see it getting in the way if you overstate its importance and it becomes an absolute necessity - that means you could be missing out on a great relationship just because they had sex already. It's not enough they want to spend the rest of their life with you, they had to know it before they even met you and not have sex? This way you could end up stuck searching for a virgin regardless of if she's compatible with you or not in other, more important ways.    I suppose I see where those men are coming from, I just think it's a bit silly. It's all right if you happen to end up with a girl who's a virgin, you can consider that a positive, but to throw away an otherwise good relationship just about that little thing is silly. Make sense?    Also, people who have sex before marriage aren't all impatient and undedicated.

If it comes down to a fight, remember, all of those loosers have weak stomach. and the only reason they try to fight is because their friends are there and/or they out number you.

BkleL3F4aa	female abusers and their victims have been hidden by feminist groups and feminists for some time now that sends the message that it ok to abuse children and long as you are female.    Kate S above is a prime example, she is defending female sex offenders but will condemn male sex offenders, feminism has damaged the rational thoughts of so many people.    Children's rights groups are trying to bring the reality to light.    Women acting alone commit 25% of all sex abuse.  3/4 runaways that are exploited sexually are exploited by women etc.    Feminism need to be named and shamed for its abuse lies.  Lets criminalise exploiting victims of abuse for political ends.        EDIT same goes for these feminists thumbing me down. Awareness about female abusers and is to be suppressed as far as they are concerned.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Isn't bias fun?     1.) There's no overall percentages here, merely a list of cases that would not make up 1% of the female teacher population... I don't doubt there are many cases, as there are many cases of male teachers abusing students.    2.) Dispite the answerer above, it says on the site many were fired and charged with abuse, many mentions of jail time when the sentence is reported, so the idea they only get a tap on the wrist is obviously incorrect    3.) Actually, male peadophiles have also been studied and found to suffer from abuse, often sexual, depression and substance abuse. It is not defending people, to attempt to understand (and thus possibly prevent) the causes of behavouir. I'm not sure where people got thi idea this was done by feminists rather than psychologists, or purely for women....    4.) The majority of peadophiles are male (the majority of males are not peadophiles, please note) although reporting biases suggest the difference is not quite as large as once believe. And Kate S may well be right... these women may well share motivations with male peadophiles; depression and a history of abuse. And explaination is not an excuse, they are still rational and in charge of their actions    (Although it's not a psychological diagnosis of peadophilia if the victem is over 12 and four years or less younger than the accused, or over 16... but it's still a very valid legal issue)|`|Q7ovix19aa	I don't call that abuse.  Although there is argument they might use coercion, that doesn't seem to be the case.    Age of adulthood was generally fourteen.  A century ago people began artificially retarding the maturity of their children.  The worst part is, once missing the windows of opportunity for maturation, we never really catch up.  Everyone beyond puberty wants sex.  They "aren't ready" because their parents retarded them.  That's why we have generations of immature adults.  That helps explain this situation.    If you want to say emotionally retarded teachers shouldn't engage with even more emotionally retarded teenagers,  I won't argue with that, but we aren't dealing with "children."  They are physically grown adults and would have been emotionally older, if they weren't prevented.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	It's because the media has a love-affair with the idea of a female teacher abusing a male child.    What is far far far more common is sexual harassment in schools directed towards women--both teachers and students--by men. Some studies have even shown that the majority of sexual harassment of men in college is perpetuated by other male teachers.    While I think that dismissing the idea of a female abusing a man is disgusting, I think that it is equally disgusting that we ignore the prevalence of male-on-female and male-on-male rape and harassment in our schools to focus on a few fantastic causes of female-on-male harassment.    Even in situations that men are the minority, they seem to be the perpetrators of the majority of sex crimes. This is supported by statistical analysis.|`|rpajoT0raa	Well, "so many" might be a bit of an exaggeration when you consider how many million female teachers there are. I wouldn't have hesitated at answering this question if you had instead written "Why are these female teachers abusing students".    Aaaah, but such is the style of a media beat up. But not that I'm saying it doesn't happen or that it's not wrong. It may even be increasing in occurrence... hard to say when we just become more aware of things these days through the media and internet.     Years ago it was so much easier to get away with being a paedophile... because people just weren't as aware of it happening. It doesn't mean that it happens more now than it did before though... and we can thank for media for exposing it and making it socially unacceptable. People didn't even used to believe that lesbians existed... so, in time, it also comes as a public shock to acknowledge the existence of female paedophiles.    I can only conject as to the reasons why some women do this... dissatisfaction in their married life, some kind of perverted pleasure in being so adored by someone they can influence and their egos getting carried away with the attention from teenage boys, perhaps. Probably very similar kinds of reasons why male paedophiles do the same thing.     Have you seen the movie "Notes on a Scandal"? (2006; starring Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench). Blanchett's role is powerful in portraying a female teacher who seduces/is seduced by a 15 yo student, and the older teacher played by Judi Dench is very sinister in her blackmailing complicity, driven by what seems to be jealousy. Issues of control and loss of self control are more central to the theme of the story than sex.|`|ejrVotg8aa	Because you get right down to it, the strong majority of teachers are complete idiots. Think back to high school, most of the teachers were idiots. They aren't getting smarter and aren't really qualified to teach.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No idea.    I wouldn't say it's a lot when you consider how many female teachers there are (and more than male teachers too). Must be a very small percentage. It happens both ways too.    Harriet|`|srIMFTb8aa	There actually aren't that many.  Those cases get a lot more publicity simply because they are unusual.    Edit: "Compared to what?"     Compared to male teachers abusing students.    "How do you know?"    It's common knowledge that the vast majority of sex offenders are men.    "Please provide data."    After you, sir.|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	Well, for one thing, the very first line states "Women who have been ACCUSED, or convicted."    Pardon me, but here in America one is "innocent until proven guilty." If there was a web site that listed MEN who had only been ACCUSED of rape, the anti-fems here would blow a blood vessel. People who have only been accused should not be listed with those that have been convicted. Completely unfair, and an obvious attempt at manipulating the numbers.    Also, where is the site that lists men who have abused students? Statistically, more men do this that women, actually. Why target only women? To ONLY focus on women, while ignoring the male offenders, is patently sexist. Or does it somehow not count as much when men do it? To what end would one only focus on women?|`|RpHewn8gaa	Because they discovered that they only get a slap on the wrist.|`|DSMveBgPaa	i believe that if you search world wide then you will find as many male teachers abusing their positions as females, however students are more willing to come forward if their abuser is female. there is a reluctance for students to say anything because they have little insight into the scope of such an adult relationship. Teachers whom abuse their abuse of position, tend to have broken homes, have troubled marriages and are divorced seeking  comfort and value amongst people who are a t the time, important to them- whether they be male or female teachers.
xeW6Mvbdaa	Is he a regular cannabis taker? This can make you psycho and suspicious irrationally. If not, he's merely a control freak naturally.

He's an immature control freak with no self confidence.|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Maybe he is the one cheating and judging you by his own behaviour  You need to explain to him that you haven't done anything wrong and he either trusts you or you break it off because you deserve to be treated better and also that a relationship without trust wont work  Good luck|`|441GSyaMaa	He probably really likes you and is just making sure that no one is imposing. I mean I do it to my girlfriend (normally as a joke, but hey...). Also it's not that he doesn't trust you, it's a case that he won't trust other people... as guys can be pretty forward and stuff, especially if you're out with a group of girls...     Just explain to him that you like him and wouldn't think about doing anything else and that he just needs to trust you and drop it, see how he reacts after that...    (Although, in saying that... apparently it's been said that if a guy is insecure about his girlfriend cheating, it can mean that he's cheated (or on the verge of (and vice versa))... but I don't know how true that is)|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	He is obviously befuddled and frustrated with your blatant disregard for spelling and grammar, and this has manifested in perhaps groundless accusations.     You should learn to spell and adhere to the rules on English grammar if you want to keep this or any boyfriend in the future.
hiSa7qthaa	First, he doesn't trust you. Second, he's trying to control you. With out trust, there's no relationship to be had. I HAD a girlfriend that was like that. Asking who I was with, where I was going, what I was going to be doing, and she tried to put limits on me. I tried to work it out with her, and it turns out the situation wasn't workable. We were together for a month, and I kicked her out. As far as whether you should get rid of him or not, that decision's up to you, but you see what I did in my situation.|`|S8H5yYcoaa	An important part of any real relationship is trust - if he cen never get over whatever it is that's making him accuse you of cheating on him, then you're not being treated right.  That said, everyone comes with their own baggage, and it's really up to you how long you're willing to deal with this before you decide it's never going to get better.  It's important that he lets you go out and have your own life... to just be around each other all the time and never do anything by yourself is unhealthy.  So long as all he's doing is acting jealous over the thought of another man moking a move, that's something worth working on; talk to him the next time he starts accusing you of cheating, try to get to the root of what's going on, see what you can do to alleviate his concerns or calm past pain (maybe he was cheated on and badly hurt before, and will need time time and evidence before being sure he can trust his heart to you, or maybe he's insecure, unconvinced for whatever reason he deserves someone as beautiful/wonderful as you, and will need some ego-stroking from time to time until he's more confident in his worthiness) - how long this goes on is entirely up to you, it's really all about how much you're willing to put up with.  But the second he starts getting violent, overly controlling of your time, or verbally abrasive over the issue, it's time to cut your ties... being abusive is maybe something that can be worked on, but being in an abusive relatinship not something you should have to deal with for any amount of time.|`|tX57rwksaa	Hi!! I have done a lot of counselling and seen this situation after people have been married. It is totally unstable in any relationship, to continue as you are will only bring misery in the end. Your BF[boy  friend] ,is being the other kind of BF( bloody Fool).   It is a very harsh choice you have to make; but the seeds of violence are planted in these situations.|`|WkLJI40baa	How can some women be so damn dumb. You have already talked to him about it and he refuses to change. I can't believe so many girls/women are saying not to breakup and give him more chanches. It is who he is, just a jealous non trusting person. Walk away now, why wait for the relationship to because abusive.|`|Ixny0YFIaa	you need to develop trust|`|K9hVqE7Haa	break up,yea,dont see any other way to go =/|`|NNWerE4Jaa	no offence but he sounds like a douchbag!! dump him and get someone that trustes you!! beacause and korney as it sounds, trust is a big part in a relationship!!|`|e056424147258c806f45d03eac7ad96eaa	sounds like he  has trust issues.  If he can't handle you going out with your girlfriends then move on.|`|pTv1Dc2Oaa	Tell him the truth. Tell him he is acting paranoid and that if he wants you to stay with him he needs to relax and trust you.     The truth will set you free, and if he can't handle it than maybe you should let him go. He needs to learn this lesson from someone. Everyone needs their space and he needs to respect this.|`|kYvF4ucVaa	ummmm.....well u should ask to talk with him with NO interruptions from him u tell him wat u think and u say if u dont believe me than this relationship is over because if u dont trust me how can i trust u? Hope I helped!|`|Ng7sF33Oaa	How old are you?

First you should sit down at the right time a tell him seriously that if he's going to keep accusing you that IT IS over.  Boyfriends shouldn't do that, there your boyfriend! They should trust you and have faith in you but if your boyfriend doesnt have this manner against you well, it's not a very healthy relationship. If you really want to give our heart away to your boyfriend talk to a counciler and they could sort things out but otherwise, the only solution is to talk and try and make up but if that doesn't work I'm terrible sorry but break up is the only way.    Good Luck x|`|9GmoO5NLaa	Unfortunatly some people are distrustful by nature.  I would reccomend talking to your BF and pointing out that you have done nothing until now to make him distrust you.    Another problem could be that he is infact cheating or be untrustworthy with you.  This could explain his paranoia.    Eitherway you should talk to him and try to sort your problems out by talking before doing anything drastic like breaking up!|`|yLNsOJiQaa	Obviously he is insecure.  You can either stay and put up the questioning or you can tell him that when he gets a life that you will come back around.  You do not need to put up with that.  Go find a guy that is secure that loves you and that with support anything that you do.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	I'm a guy and I fall foul from the other side of the fence.    I was very jealous of my first proper girlfriend. One of, they came to be anyway, my best friends bought a lab coat off her soon after we had hooked up and I was wracked with doubts and jealousy that she was even talking to another guy. I've always been confident in myself, but even so there's a biological competitiveness between males. I liked the girl and I would be damned if I was going to let another guy get a sniff in. I didn't feel good about myself for thinking and feeling that. I didn't say anything to her, but she knew anyway, I think. I did have jealousy issues. She lied to me about sleeping with a guy she met on holiday before she met me. I found out about it when she was having a girl talk and let it slip. She'd carried on writing to him after we'd hooked up, and I guess she lied to protect my feelings. It certainly didn't make me distrust her. I got jealous when I saw how close her and her cousin got in Canada when we went on a long visit. She would go into the cellar (his den) in her nightclothes sometimes, and it drove me nuts.    I resolved never to be like that about someone again. It took us breaking up (over my infidelity as it happened)  for me to realise that I was still a child thinking like that.    Put the ball in his court. Tell him "Look, I am not going to defend my going out without you around, because I don't need to. We are together and I'm not looking for anyone else. You appear to have an issue with jealousy, and I'm kind of flattered by that, but it's become a turn off. So you either deal with it and trust me and we go on to see how this relationship grows, or you carry on doubting me and crush any future we might have had. So ask yourself now, what do you REALLY care about? Call me in a week."|`|c4sn6g3xaa	He is not the right boyfriend for you.

It is better to say nothing and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt!|`|djjVYhWiaa	Girl, don't stand for that possessive behavior.  Your man should trust you!  If you've cheated before, then sure, I can understand why he might be a little uncomfortable at times, but you need to set him straight:  You're not a cheater.  If he can't understand that then you need to get away from this guy soon because he sounds like he gets creepy with these suspicions.  Don't let him do this to you, you're much better than that.
dXyR1R8Yaa	How does it do harm? The only way I could see it doing harm is if they got a big ego. But if it is a genuine compliment then that is not really a problem. Being nice to people is always good, and it's not like it takes much effort to give someone a compliment.   I am not sure why this question is specifically about complimenting women. It makes no difference, being nice is always good.    Even if it is a gushing compliment or an over exaggeration I would never say a compliment is out of order. Sometimes they can be a bit over the top and make the person look a little socially awkward, but it is still really sweet. The only bad type of compliment is a sarcastic one.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Depends on the woman, the situation, the need, and how she is related to us.    Complimenting the wife will almost always be good for the family, the husband and the relationship.    Complimenting the teen GF will almost always bring her back for more.    Complimenting a REAL/experienced/mature woman will almost always get you in her good books if it was sincere.    Complimenting a co-worker regarding her looks/dress will almost always bring a harassment lawsuit into your resume.    There are exceptions but they are just that.    "about guys who compliment women as the first things out of their mouth." - Ah the butt-kissing kind. They have no idea how the human mind works.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Yeah sorta, coming off desperate doesn't tend to appeal to most women.

D8drSiMXaa	well.being lazy is something everyone experiences. you can be lazy for a number of reasons:  - you don't really like the job you ought to do  - you think you've done enough  - you don't see the point in doing the job [which is what you said]  - you just don't want to tire yourself out  i guess what you said is true. but then there are people who are just lazy because they prefer being relaxed, which means not exerting any effort on anything. not really because there's no benefit. it's just that they really don't want to move. that's one of my weird wishes. to be able to stay in bed all day, just daydreaming, not thinking about anything, and not feeling guilty about it. sometimes, being lazy can be a treat to yourself. but only sometimes.|`|w5sK75MPaa	Some people yes, but most are lazy because of all the gadgets & entertainment in life that distract us from not only work but blinds us of whats really going on in the world.

hJAtgbb8aa	I would definitely call her family if I had the number, or definitely call the police.  If that's not an option, I would run to her and talk to her about it and explain her the deal...tell her that I have moved on and she should too, and since she's my ex, she's my past and so I am her's.    I know love can turn sane people insane...but if we are strong enough and don't let our love blind us, I think we can stop ourselves from doing something stupid.  Suicide will not even be on my list of last thing to do.    She needs help, and she can only help herself in this case if others fail to do so.    Most probably she ain't killing herself.

Call the police or suicide hotline, something like that|`|TZkdK1TYaa	Well... Theres a few ways you can handle this.    Start with: To just tell them it wasn't ment to be and we all gota move on with our lives. (add a few more heart felt words here to calm them down)    Option 1: Sometimes a stern, "You think this is going to change anything in our relationship? Well your wrong your only making me more scared to be around you. And the last thing I need to have is a suicidal EMO person for the rest of my life" You can threaten to hang up then. But usaully those words will stop anyone in their tracks to hurt them selves.    Option 2: If they continue to ramble on about suicide then just say have fun killing yourself since your too stubern to step out of your shoes and think about the situation.    Then if they are willing to listen, you can talk them in to a understanding.    Import NOTE: Don't get sucked back in from a threat. It's weak and petty. If you were not happy in the first time it will never work out. So you have to be strong and have lots of patients if you want the friendship to exist in some way. Work it out and tell them off the bat if they want to be so silly it's not worth your time to deal with their stupid suicidel games. It's time to grow up...    Last Resort: If they start cutting themselves while on the phone you have to take control of the situation at this point with a demanding voice. Not a yelling voice... If it looks to be real bad and no way to control this, signal to a friend or family member in the house hold to call the police while you try to talk to them.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	I would call somebody close to her and give them a heads up.

So, it seems like she doesn't want to live anymore.  If she gets killed for running away, then (if i were in her place) I'd try to run away.  I'd rather have someone kill me than for me to kill myself.    She doesn't seem like she can really live her life.  So, mind as well as take the risk to attain freedom rather than to live a miserable existence.    I'm saying this because my father was in the same situation.  He was living in a really harsh environment in his country.  So, he decided to become a refugee and left his country to come here.  It wasn't easy - he had to do it with a team and could've died trying to leave his country - but he did it.  Now, he is free and has a family in the United States.|`|wJtm5krFaa	That's a really tough situation.    How old is she? If you really want to help her out, I would start saving up money so when she turns the legal age over there, she can come here.    I have absolutely no experience with a situation like this so I am not even sure getting her out of there is a possibility.    Also, if you take her out, you have to help her. You're helping her get out of a crappy country into a country she doesn't know much about..      I honestly don't know.. It's a really tough situation.|`|D8drSiMXaa	tell your friend that she should bother living because a great friend like you who wants to help her is there for her. hope is never gone, just covered. and once you see everything in a pessimistic way, all the more will hope be buried underneath the ground, and if you don't believe in yourself, you'll never be able to find it. but really, the committing suicide thing is simply preposterous. never do that. that's the most senseless thing in the world. tell your friend that she still has hope, especially if she would try to have a circle of good friends like you who are willing to help her. good luck, hope she stays safe. you can do it.
piJi29Traa	I think that's probably the wrong way round.    Many people with mental health issues find outlets for their emotions and fears in creativity such as poetry, art, and crafts.    I think that for some, it is an essential part of their own personal coping strategies, and without these outlets they could maybe even find themselves becoming more ill.    However, for others I guess that allowing themselves to "wallow" in their misery could be counter-productive. But that is purely my own unsubstantiated assumption.    I have been in the position myself of needing to find an outlet for my thoughts and feelings when I was really struggling to recover from a suicidal bout of depression. I wrote reams of poetry. And since my situation has changed and I've found that there are other ways of dealing with my feelings, the poetry has just stopped coming.    Maybe these creative results of mental illness are the silver lining of the cloud of misery. A hidden "benefit" to suffering, so that when we look back on those difficult times, we have something positive from it, to show that it wasn't a total waste of our energies?|`|aLwrpMPXaa	LOL, yes especially if you read anything from Charles Bukowski.

She's alright now and has no sign of testicalation. but she's on life support.   if i was you, i would get to a doctor or psychiatrist because this means you have a problem "down there" and it should be treated immediately.     and remember, there's nothing wrong with you.. you're just confused.       i hope i helped. best of luck to you!    -Ben Dover|`|qPj7p6D1aa	A majority of people believe dreams are real in terms of present, past, and future, stereotyped references I may call these and not much to form a logical point from. The male will unconsciously role model from a male figure and this can be anybody he sees as significant in his life. So does the female as she roles after a female figure and you may be seeing yourself as a influential person whom is desiring the male dominant position in society. As Sigmund Freud would have entered his plea, you could be in competition with your mother for your father's attention, all of this is normal.   P.S. I have viewed a few of these answers from those whom take Yahoo as some kind of frolicking side-show and possibly they have the problems we don't want.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	It could be on how your dad treats/treated you.

s6MsrhIJaa	MAINTAIN a VIABLE economy..? No, at least not for long. a viable SUSTAINABLE economy has to import and export, preferably in equal measure over time. consumerism of late was only possible because chinese workers get paid zip so the prices of the goods we consumed were low. also the cheap credit (funded by chinese govt buying US bonds) cannot last forever.  the working class have never had any money, historically the wages paid to working people only pay the rent and food and a few bits and pieces. the stuff they make has always been sold on by the capitalists (upper class) for many times what they pay the people who made it.  the cheap credit of late hid the fact that wages for working people have not shifted an inch since the early 1970's (in REAL terms, which means a weeks wage goes no further now than it did then).    USA returning its manufacturing base is unlikely right now as the upper class make the call on this and they can get the same stuff done for zip still in china so they ain't going to do that, yet.  if the depression gets real deep though and the upper class see the country going to the dogs they might get persuaded (by such things as free land, tax breaks, subsidies and other tax payer funded handouts) to reopen factories in the USA. don't hold ya breath though as they will wait till they can get the best deal from your taxes and/or get the US worker real cheap, say another 2 years of bad unemployment.    George S writes..."When overpopulating stops, the field will begin to level. It was here until hordes of overpopulating cheap labor flooded in, and took jobs away to their countries."    this is utter nonsense, all you need to do is look at the fact that poverty has been around ALOT longer than over population. many millions of Irish people were ruined in part by british landlords, when nearly half the people left for the USA did the Irish who stayed home then become wealthy? NO, the same people with power stayed rich and the poor stayed desperately poor. if this george S is serious and not pulling your leg he is very poorly educated and has not studied the most basic economics books available. poverty is created by one group exploiting its power over another and has absolutley nothing to do with how many people that involves.  remember who it is that lets foreign labour into your country..do you? No it is the guys who run the show, the ones who gain from your wages staying low due to competition from cheap imported labour, this is that exploitative power in action, the power over you and your wages.|`|Kn90YAzYaa	I think you're right, that is what just happened.  A viable economy for all segments of society is achieved when we export, and not just import.  Importing all of our cheap crap from China hasn't helped us either.  America doesn't really export anything anymore, except for maybe diapers and specialty goods, but those places are going broke too.|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	So far, consumerism is the only way a middle class can exist.    How can you tell if you are doing well if you don't have an iPhone, laptop with way more computing power than you will ever need to create invoices and check your email, a bigger SUV with more expensive rims than your neighbor has, a pool in the backyard, if you can't dress your kids in designer clothes?|`|Q7ovix19aa	Well, the Marxists have indoctrinated you.  Everybody "consumes."  We must to survive.  There's nothing innately wrong with it, but we have been squandering for a long time and that has led to trouble.    The poor make themselves poor by pumping out too many babies and making ever cheaper labor.  Ever cheaper labor makes the rich richer.  When overpopulating stops, the field will begin to level.  It was here until hordes of overpopulating cheap labor flooded in, and took jobs away to their countries.    But that's not what the envious and jealous industrial-capitalism-hating Marxists indoctrinated you to believe, is it?|`|1f09a32e86c48c5973b96fb7ecb4ee33aa	Dave H nailed it    I'm not really sure what the USA economy is based on, tho the "consumerism" sound-byte will create many "yup" head-nods.    it's a tough question and the recipe for digging out of the current economic hole is one that none seem to have discovered yet    but I'm certain that Obama was the better choice for hopes at arriving at a successful effort
w2mBCzK3aa	Sounds like he needs a girlfriend|`|Gnhgfx4naa	Aww, Poor guy. Hes depressed :-(|`|VBtzeVlKaa	That does sound like a major depression. If you can, do try to talk to him and cheer him up...let him see that no matter what is going on in his life right now, things WILL get better, and that life is worth living, not just existing it away from all the people who care about him.    Perhaps something has happened lately at work, or some other aspect of his life that has made him withdraw from everything? Try to find out if that is the case, etc...     OR it may just be he is trying meditation, and needs some time alone to figure out some things in his life and what route to take, etc.     It wont hurt to show you care, and try to find out what indeed is going on, and help him if indeed he needs help... (if he lets you of course)    All the best!|`|AA11103493	Not a lot you can do, you could try and have a word with him but he won't listen to you.  Hopefullly he's not involved in a cult otherwise he could be in real trouble.|`|AA11056379	sounds like he has become depressed. What you describe are classic signs of depression. He might need more then a word fropm you, but a trip to a Dr to help him. But..you ca'nt force someone from not getting help if they don't see it.|`|gSwobfujaa	as with any story there are two sides. and when thought out they tend to be dramatized. im pretty sure most of what you said is true- at least in your personal observation. but im also sure some of it is a little drawn out for dramatic effect. there are so many different elements to every story. there is a reason why his personality has changed. maybe you guys arent the type of crowd he wants to be around any more. maybe you guys do drugs, drink too much, do childish things etc. and we all grow up at some point. he could very well be at a rough patch in his life where he finds he isnt very happy anymore. i do think you should have a sit down with him and see whats going on with him. ask him directly why he has changed so much. if he is happy, sad, angry. dont assume he thinks hes better...he may feel like he just doesnt fit in anymore. well either way. good luck and i hope you talk to him. real friends would do that.|`|1CVOHoapaa	I think I need a while to consider this question fully. The ramifications of a impulsive responses can be catastrophic. Should religion be discussed in an open forum. Will adverse responses offend?

I'm about to start having therapy myself so I can't say if it'll help him or not, but apparently people get better after seeing a decent shrink|`|X6xa3ZNmaa	This is the bad side of religion, talk to hip get out with him do something!  he will soon realize 95% of his friends don't care about him and that the other 5% is himself.... =)|`|cJKi6qdMaa	haha your friend needs to start looking at life on the brighter side. Even though i think life is 99.99% suffering and 0.01% of happiness i still try to make every single minute of my life intresting and fun! I go out alot with my friends and try to make the best out of that 0.01% . You should talk to him cuz its stupid to give up having fun. Personally i dont like overly serious people because they are booooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiii...|`|lcGriJXiaa	No, it's not healthy behavior.  He is becoming emotionally and mentally unbalanced.   If you have any influence with him, try to talk him into getting professional help.  It could be chronic depression or something more serious like a chemical imbalance, early stage of dementia, etc.  You may want to talk to his relatives as well, if you know how to contact them.  If he is withdrawing even from them, they may not know what is going on with him.|`|MAABo1zKaa	People sometimes go through changes in life. He may have decided randomly one day that his slackage and lack of concentration on values was getting him nowhere.Or someone could have said something to him to set him off onto this track hes on... Sometimes people over-do it though and get into a mental state where they consume themselves with the idea that they need to be a walking poster child. If he has good concentration and work ethic, most likely it will be more severe than your average A.D.D child.People often put 'fixing' themselves above all when they become fixated on it and as a result lose everything in the process of "finding themselves" which most of the common population knows never happens. my best advice is support him and his new-found lifestyle and morals. even if you don't agree with his changes the more you play along the faster it will pass.but also suggest things in a light that he can see.. even if its brutal. once he picks his head up for a minute he will eventually see that his new obsession has dug him into more **** than he had started with. I would definitely discuss with him how you feel but bitching at him and tearing him a new one will most likely get you nowhere. so approach it from a mature logical angle.   -i dunno if that helps you but.. that's my opinion.|`|nPt7hUE8aa	There is some way deeper issue at hand.  Something must have happened to set this behavior off. Honestly, and I'm not a Christian... I haven't met one believer of god who thinks life is 95% suffering. That is not what religion teaches you.  Most of them think life is precious and are grateful for what time they have.     Others are saying he sounds depressed which I can sorta see, but I think there is something besides depression going on.  It's very hard to even guess as we don't know anything about him. See, I immediately thought self esteem issues. I used to be a sociable person too, but something in my head just snapped and I ended up bulimic and still am... I quit hanging out with my friends, I quit meeting new people, I quit doing anything that involved being around people... especially new people. I honestly thought that no one would like me cos I was fat. I still to a point believe that. No matter how many times people tell me I'm not fat, I don't believe them so I avoid people. I also avoid going out with my friends if there is eating involved because I know I can't go to the bathroom when I'm done. So I avoid.     I'm not saying your friend is bulimic... I'm just saying, this behavior is similar to mine. People think I'm extremely stuck up and I've heard countless times how I think I'm better than everyone.. and that's truly not the case.... I just don't want to be un an uncomfortable situation. Your friend doesn't sound like he think he's above you guys, it sounds more like you it being perceived that way because he's avoiding stuff... or he could be purposely doing it so he pushes people away...    I don't know if any of this helped, but I don't think your friend has actually changed , I just think something major is going on with him right now... could he have possibly realized he may be gay? I'm not being funny either, I know what my friend Justin was like when he realized it...|`|AA11587891	Firstly he is only overly serious to you.  Perhaps he is just changing?  He may indeed being going through a more contemplative stage and his withdrawal may not be entirely healthy if he is being so negative.    Why not make an effort and see him and suggest going to a retreat so he can discuss his concerns with a pastor or counsellor.    Why not talk to him and tell him you are worried for him.  There is as much evidence for positive things in the world as negative and he needs to think about those.|`|bbf482485b71760a0170b5baf7ae67fdaa	It is unlikely, but possible that this pattern of behavior is the first manifestation of schizophrenia. How old is he? Perhaps you could talk to his parents or next of kin and tell them that you are worried about his mental health.
Twlv29kLaa	nice way to see it! sure we have songs for every moment of our life, happy, sad, or any other moment. and it could change time after time!|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Lol....  That's one way of looking at it.      But I think it is more like an MP3 when it's "random" setting seems stuck on a particular song selection and repeats those more.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	Yup - we indulge in our emotions when we listen to music, usually to get them out of our systems.|`|QTiTDz4yaa	Yes but my turn table is broken.
0794f3b9849fc2a6250e111221be1815aa	Dear Salman,  I personally agree to view point to the extend of 100%, but looking at the pitiable condition of the ill person, who is experiencing death-like trouble every day, don't you feel that he should be allowed to die in order to take his next birth or to rest in peace for times to come, although it sounds cruelty. I hope you will now mind for my answer even if you disagree with the view point.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	I'm torn on this one.    On the one hand....  There is a point to wanting to die with dignity if that is a person's choice.  (I personally am more disturbed by the idea of being stuck in a bed, hooked to machines and not being able to live anymore than a plant whithering in the corner.)    However, on the other hand....  If we allow assisted suicide to be legalized, you create a possible loop hole for some ppl to get away with murder for their own gain.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No|`|Twlv29kLaa	just stop any kind of medication! and see what's going to happen. if the time is come, the time is come!

TCB2C8NPaa	Absurd.  Being a single mother due to having a child out of wedlock is not necessarily irresponsible behaviour.  Many women choose to become single mothers.  Single parenthood is not a plague.  Even in cases where BOTH parents have been irresponsible, you do not have the right to punish the child, or hold a "mistake" against a person for the next 18 years.    There is nothing wrong with being a single mother or father.  Eliminating tax cuts would not solve this "problem" because (1) it is not a problem, and (2) people will continue to have unplanned pregnancies because they are UNPLANNED.  In cases where people choose to be single parents, it has nothing to do with irresponsibility, and those individuals can probably afford not to have a tax break.  This change you propose might result in an increase in abortion rates, nothing more.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	By making the mother suffer, you're also making the child suffer.  Children don't ask to be born into the circumstances they were, they shouldn't be denied compensation due to the decisions of their mothers.    My mom's never been married. I was born out of wedlock, and the tax money usually bought me school clothes/supplies..|`|rpajoT0raa	Aaaah... the predatory politics of fiscal discrimination. Taxation is good a way to discourage economic behaviors but social engineering through the tax system is very dangerous territory when serving personal value and belief systems. These tactics would never work under the tax laws and principles of a democratic country. Try China or countries in the middle east or Africa maybe. But if the USA became a fundamentalist Christian totalitarian state and destroyed its legal structures to enact such crazy extreme punishing tax laws, then they'd be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.|`|JF343E2Taa	i agree yet disagree as my sister is now a single mum her husband left her with 2 kids but she works part time and her kids are well behaved looked after and she adores them but some girls have kids purely for money houses so yes in that sense i agree and i also think asylum seekers who have children should not get a penny these are 1 of the many reasons why this country is in recession too generous overpopulating the list is endless|`|WkLJI40baa	I agree only because improper behavior should not be rewarded. Should it be implemented, no. Children should not be punished for the ignorance of the parents.    Fems- please notice I stated parents. No reason to attack men by saying it is there fault because they didn't stay with the mother.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Right because all these women plan their single motherhood, the guy is never at fault, and nobody would have sex out of marriage if they didn't get tax breaks. You'd think already things like STDs, children, etc. would be stopping irresponsible people having sex irresponsibly, and/or breaking up when they have a pregnancy, but if that doesn't work, I reckon tax breaks will do the trick!    Harriet|`|DhQMzN52aa	Then the children suffer which isn't exactly desirable either, what about just putting the energy and resources into educating our children better.  I've read that the better educated women are in a country the more the birth rate decreases.    Again I disagree, people don't think about the tax breaks when they're knocking boots,  however if they were taught the consequences properly, short term and long term they might think twice.  Education should never be seen as a drain on the tax payer, it should be seen as an investment in the future, the generation that will be paying for our nursing homes|`|389e7164290adeeee9f7eb9db38e3a15aa	why would you want to reward someone for being married and then having children? Wouldn't that further dilute the sanctity of  marriage further? Then we would have people marrying each other for a tax break.    Furthermore, an elimination of the credit MAY result in fewer children born out of wedlock, however most school districts receive funding based on the amount of children attending school, so they wouldn't necessarily equate to more money in education.    Good question though but I don't think it is plausible in this society since it would be a way to control the population, which would end up making us more like China than anyone else.|`|VCHC4B8Paa	That's a ridiculous thing to suggest. You really think women that are right about to have sex are going to stop and think "Hm, maybe I should use a condom because now I won't get a tax break from having a kid?"  You're also being really judgmental of single-mothers. What about the "guys who think that when they get women pregnant it's not their responsibility to take care of the child" plague? It makes more sense to address this issue. If the guys were held more accountable and actually had to share the financial burden of the child, more single mother's would not have to rely on financial assistance (i.e. welfare) from the government. The government can also make birth control more affordable and readily available. Child care is another thing that needs to be affordable to single moms can work, thus again eliminating these women's dependence on welfare. Also, accidents happen. Birth control fails. Do you suggest that the government should punish all women that have sex before marriage? Because as many women know, accidents happen easier than you would think. Sometimes it just takes on tiny act of irresponsibility to cause a pregnancy and it's wrong to judge someone on that. We have all been irresponsible at some point in our lives, and some just have more long-term consequences than others.

In other words, After listening your intuition about love,then it is true love. When some one in love as seems questioner in her question,it is quite possible to ignore your intuition. Then it is possible in such case to regret due to ignore your intuition. In conclusion, the questioner wants to know about true love and ordinary love in the question. On this basis, the questioner seems to be important about love and I thank her for her nice thoughts.

If the Truth was conceived then the truth was that the US expansion was conceived in a Genocide of Native American Tribes.    If the Truth was conceived to establish this nation it was in the truth of per suing a document that would Take 250 years to get right.     If Justice was meant to establish the US from Freedom of Taxation with out representation then yes, King George eat his own words.     If Justice was meant for all People living under the Constitution African American Slaves would have been freed long ago.  But economic Justice of Cotton Plantation owners prevailed based on the labor work force requirements for the Colonies. 1864 is when States rights were violated and the Union and Confederate states began a war.     If Justice is was established under the Constitution Southern States after the war would not have been under Martial Law for 10 plus years.    If Justice was done Native American Treaties would have been honored by the US government.    If Riotousness was the elevation of US development of a great nation under god. Then Yes.     Not all history is going to be perfect. Its the end result of what we have here now is what is amazing despite the hard times our nation is falling on.

UwiGwDGdaa	Not at all - it's a societal horror, in my opinion.   Anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders, and now they're being popularized because of the fashion industry. Less than 100 years ago, women were a healthy size and celebrated their curves as part of womanhood - now the western culture idealizes women with large chests who have the figure of a teenage boy.     I recently overheard a child talking about how fat she was - when I turned around, it was one of my 3rd grade students (I'm a teacher). I was so disheartened.     Kids are turning to eating disorders with no regard to the health risks - just look at the diet & fitness board right here on Y!A. The majority of the questions are from people who ask if starving is okay and how quickly they'll lose weight, thinking they can drop 20 pounds in 2 weeks and keep it off with no consequences - kids don't believe me when I tell them incontinence is a side effect of eating disorders. Just wait, they'll learn.    In my lifetime, I've had more guys tell me they enjoy the curves of a woman and would rather have that then a woman who looks like she's 12.     I hope one day we can change the standard.|`|1a1f6b3a9f0969e8e30f27956f086c4eaa	I think that society has created a misconception that anorexics are "strong" because there is such an emphasis on weight, dieting, exerciser, food. I've heard many women "joke" they wish that they could be anorexic. While people tend to seem concerned if they notice someone they care about not eating, often it seems to be a little bit out of jealousy. It's not until a person with anorexia gets really bad that people get truly worried. I think you're right, in a way our society has set up people to be anorexic by declaring thin actresses "too thin!" and normal weighted actress "putting on the pounds!"  I think that anorexia is a serious disease and that society wrongly treats it as a means to an end.|`|lcGriJXiaa	It is a common thing . . . that's why it is viewed as such.  I think at one time, extreme thinness was portrayed as the ideal for women, but I believe the picture is gradually changing.  There are more ads on TV showing full-bodied women, and the ideal now is a well-sculptured, athletic body rather than a shapeless bean pole.  Anorexia is not normal, and there is a fine line between being weight-conscious and anorexic.  In a "fat" society like we have in America, however, the latter should definitely be encouraged.|`|0hSpsSByaa	No, the obsessiveness is leading otherwise healthy young women to become ill, both physically and psychologically.  While not being overweight is important to health, young women too often have a totally warped idea of what they should weigh and what size they should be, and don't seem to even begin to comprehend that bone structure and body build make different people's ideal body weight different, even if they are the same height.  According to the doctor, my ideal weight in high school (eons ago) was 135 because I had a big bone structure and was meant to be curvy.  Now, a girl the same height as me would think she was terribly fat at that weight no matter her build.

To love someone is always taking a risk, but, in those well-known words, "It is better to have loved and lost (or be hurt) than to never have loved at all."  I'm sure when your pain diminishes (and with time it does, believe me) you will agree.  And since you are the kind of person who knows how to love, you will love again eventually.  I hope next time it is the painless kind.|`|9ed1e55228c6c8f8bca014e6699631dfaa	Because we feel fooled.  Love trusts someone to be  considerate and cautious with our feelings. We are selective in who we trust whole heartily.        Giving your  heart to someone is like handing over all of your defense's. Surrendering your coat of armour.  Trusting that this won't be used against you.        It hurts to know that our own judgment of character sucks. It just hurts to be wrong about who we trust with our hearts.|`|oYSDEWrfaa	I think that there are many forms of "love". "Love" is a single word used to describe a multitude of different types of  love that people can feel for one another.     I think true love doesn't hurt. True love can only be when 2 people love themselves enough to love each other with out restriction but with understanding. I think true love knows that sometimes the one's you love will hurt you and it's a choice to forgive them for that. Also, just because two people argue doesn't mean they don't love each other with all that they have and just because two people don't argue doesn't mean that they do.    If someone truly loved someone they would want them to be happy even if that meant not being with them and it may be hurtful but because that person loves them self enough to know that just because that other person didn't love them they way they wanted them to doesn't mean there is anything wrong with them or that they are not worthy of love.     From a broader perspective I would like to mention that I believe love & pain are dichotomies. I don't think it's possible to truly know love without knowing pain. They in some way mutually define one another and are part of the many miracles in life's experiences. When we hurt we learn and we grow, we grow to appreciate, we grown to learn from mistakes, we grow to accept ourselves, and we learn to love ourselves enough to be with someone who knows our worth as well as their own. I think the hurtful experiences help us to know when we meet the one who truly loves us.    Best wishes~|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Real love doesn't hurt.

nPt7hUE8aa	Yeah, just a little, but talking to yourself is pretty normal... well more like thinking out loud.  When someone is in a state of panic, it's normal to think out loud and assure yourself everything will be ok.  I'm not really sure what your boyfriend says to you, but if it's like "wow you look so sexy in those pants"  I would say most people wouldn't recite this to themselves, mostly stuff like "you're gonna be ok", "try to relax and stay calm", " it's not as bad as it seems"... you know stuff like that....

AA11064298	We can.  It's usually referred to as the mixed economy.    The demand element allows consumers to demand goods and services in relation to their wants and desires, and for industry to meet them by employing resources and organising production.  The price mechanism can be expected to determine the market acceptability of most goods and services, and the profitability of production.  This is the normal mechanism for most economies, and all in the "free world".    The command element refers to the use of tax revenues by governments. They decide what goods and services are desirable or necessary for the public benefit, even if households and industry don't think so.  So governments order and procure military equipment, highways building, schools and public hospitals, scientific research, public transport and so on.  Left to the market place, these goods and services may (would?) never be ordered because households and firms would not be prepared to pay from their own pockets.  Governments (democratic or not) adopt the stance, "We know what's good for the public benefit, and we'll tax you so that we can provide it."     Do you think that NASA would have been financed to send men to the moon in the 1960s if everyone was asked to chip in $20,000 per household and 100,000 per company?  Do you think the "war on terror" would have been started if every family was asked for $45,000 to fund it, and give their  sons to go fighting?  I suggest not, but that's the concomitant of the mixed economy.    Conversely, who will look after the sick poor or social inadequates, or provide a police force or an emergency service or beach lifesavers unless there is some element of public finance through taxation?  It requires a governmental process (democratic or not) to command that such provisions are to be made.    Get the idea?

Your dream is typical of adolescent years and nothing to be associated with the opposite sex. Dreams are legible if open-minded and so are relationships. Your maternal guardian has a significant influence on your dreams as well as the paternal, and dreams are symbolic in disguising these characters to somewhat of a believable instance such as yours. You may read Sigmund's discoveries and use these as a foundation for your answer which would probably help you rather than to read a lengthily description from myself, I wish you luck and I'm always here for a question.|`|SxsJEAOiaa	It means you've been watching too many sitcoms. jk, I don't know.

eGpOIV12aa	Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)  Created in 1933 as part of FDRs New Deal. The AAA controlled the production and prices of crops by offering subsidies to farmers who stayed under set quotas. The Supreme Court declared the AAA unconstitutional in 1936.    The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public work relief program for unemployed men, focused on natural resource conservation from 1933 to 1942. As part of the New Deal legislation proposed by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), the CCC was designed first, to aid relief of unemployment stemming from the Great Depression and secondly, carry out a broad natural resource conservation program on national, state and municipal lands. The executive order to create the program was introduced by FDR to the 73rd United States Congress on March 21, 1933, and Senate Bill 5.598, the Emergency Conservation Work Act as it was known, was signed into law on March 31, 1933.
Q7ovix19aa	I wish I could.  My sister claims that's the only one that works for her.  I can't say it isn't but I always wondered if that was just the one she likes (maybe gets high on it).  She is bipolar and schizoid affected.  Both of those are inclined to not want medicine.      It's difficult to tell what's true from her.  She believes everything that pops into her head.  That seems to be the syndrome for schizophrenia.     I am clinically depressed (and I too seem to have some bipolar inclinations) and only one has worked for me (not Haldol).  Electro-convulsive therapy did work initially before they found the one that helps, but that helps only some depressives.  It has been found to be not so effective for other types of illness and doesn't work for all depressives.    I don't think being African-American makes any difference.  We're not.

lcGriJXiaa	He is probably a mix of choleric and sanguine: extroverted, happy-go-lucky, rash, full of himself and unconscious of how he makes others feel.  However, having said that, I would add that beneath this exterior, he is insecure, has low self-esteem, and is very immature probably due to childhood abuse and exposure to the same attitudes and behavior of his dysfunctional caregivers.  Much of that kind of attitude and behavior could be learned rather than as a display of personality.  It may also be compounded by Attention Deficit Disorder.  If uncorrected since childhood, it would surface as the adult version, and may require medication to control.  At very least, his actions at work need to be confronted by his employer in all fairness to the other employees to see if he is able or willing to correct his behavior.|`|s34GP3Ioaa	Is this for real?  He sounds like Homer Simpson the cartoon character.  My guess is that he was a spoiled or neglected child growing up.  He definitely needs constant attention revealed by his behavior and is not sensitive to other people's needs & just isn't tuned into the world around him.  I would label him an "Oaf".  Under neath all of this rudeness is a frighted child who I guarantee you doesn't have any friends and is very lonely.  He's mental.........and in need of medical help.  Talk to your coworkers and see if all of you can approach the boss and get this guy some help. I assume he disrupts the productivity of your office.

One of my best lecturers is freaked out from large lecture groups and always says throughout a lecture that he's nervous and shy.

Also for practical speeches etc. practice in front of your close friends, family or even pets :) They would be so critical on you being perfect and gives good live practice.

1d144c3a5d03c47f15784117493133c8aa	As much as i would like to agree with the others, we will not fall into another depression. Yes it is true that unemployment is rising, but it is a lagging indicator (happens after the change) the important leading indicator you should keep an eye on is consumer confidence, this number reflects current and short run consumption levels. The severity of this recession will depend on how confident consumers feel. With everyone running around screaming the sky is falling it's no wonder why the consumers are afraid to purchase items. Another leading indicator is the stock market, it is not effected by employment numbers, it effects them!!! Hope this helps!!!|`|L5IsUhacaa	Yes. Plain cut answer. The job market has taken another hit. That soon will lead us into another dip in the stock market. That in turn will leave the banks even on more edge, and loan out to fewer than it does normally. That in turn leaves small and medium business struggling to keep up with supply and demand, cut back on supply thus needing to fire more employees. That in turn leaves those whom have no credit or no liquid assets wanting to purchase any properties, and the real estate just keeps a stagnant pace of decline. If there is no government intervention of forcing mass amounts of liquid assets back into the economy, we can say hello to the depression once more.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	No economic major here... but look at California no money to pay bills.

He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,  that brings forth his fruit in its season.  It's leaf also shall not wither,  And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  Psalm 1:1-3    Read also Joshua 1-6-9, John 15:1-7.

Personally, I think success is an individual concept.   It depends on an individual's goals and ideals.         It can be measured by the level of happiness that the achievement brings.              Some people feel that the essence of "Success" is having status symbols and material possessions.      Others feel successful when they have done well in school or won a contest.   Some feel successful when they have become the next supermodel or the next American Idol.         Others simply measure success by the little things in life that give them a sense of peace and accomplishment.           If you define "success" as being a billionaire, you would measure it in that way.  If you define "success" as beating your opponent in a competition, you would measure it in that way.  If you define "success" as discovering the cure for AIDS, you would measure it in that way.  If you define "success" as living a life in which you helped others and fulfilled your goals, you would measure it in that way.

Success is not something seen from outside but it the internal feeling of the man and the right one ,as someone may appear successful in the eyes of others but inside himself he don't see that.  Just consider someone gave all his time ,effort and health for his work and gaining money and neglected his children ,his wife ,relatives whatever he meant that or not, we can't consider him successful as he limited success in one narrow aim represented in money and work.  We can't measure success by a materialistic measures like Wealth or Position and neglecting the human side in the man's life.  What may help man if he won the world and lost himself? Most of who are apparently successful understand this well.|`|AA11894640	I feel when you overcome your fears,  your insecurities,  remove obstacles lying in your path,  taking care not to harm others in the process...That's the essence!

vVH5rKztaa	I too was diagnosed as bipolar and I can relate to that intense urge you refer to-I believe it will keep our spirits young until the day we die if this disorder remains uncurable.  I get crazy, great ideas probably on an hourly basis.  After being diagnosed, I've become much more aware of the symptoms and I currently have no insurance so I had to find a way to control it without taking my medication everyday.  I write all of my ideas in a book before I jump on them and start "making them happen".  A day or 2 later, I will look back and toss the ones that seem useless and try and build on the ones that seem a little more logical and helpful to me or anyone.    Recently, I came up with a program that will educate highschool seniors and juniors on all the new things that will effect them upon turning 18-specifically the governmental system.  I put a plan/summary/presentation together with the help of a small business administration at my college.  I was working 2 jobs and attending school full-time but this was one idea that I didn't feel I could let go.  And it was well worth it.|`|AA11297786	Not always but I think you once you find your idea and the medium for expression there is the need to project outward and make everyone realize it. It is about showing off your perspective. But with bipolar disorder, when you're on the up swing and your idea/vision comes, it might seem like it is excruciatingly important to get the work done quickly so everyone can see the genius in you. On the down swing, you feel belittled that you could accomplish everything at once. It is a cycle that you have to realize and plan for.    Madam--you are so right.|`|e3ad2030afbb22197a4d4e3183bdc24faa	I think bipolar somehow makes one think in multidimensions and this may be why it is so hard for people to understand it. Afterall, people always fear what they do not know.    Thinking multidimensionally  gives the ability and desire to try many things.Where others wont.It's actually a blessing in disguise so embrace it. Being that Spring is coming many will begin to feel hypomania and it usually peaks about April.    Many famous artists,musicians and actors etc evn major CEOs of large corporations... had or currently have bipolar or some for of it.They found their niche or medium and released their energy through it.    They are beginning to merge Bipolar with Seasonal affective disorder because the two are so identical.When winter comes people wane,slow down and some go into depression.Some just stay low.    As spring comes moods begin to pick up by Summer many become super manic and if they don't have some way to release that energy productively then this is when the trouble begins.    The trick is lassoing that energy but keeping it at a happy medium.    Doctors give meds to prevent that  from coming on and this is why so many feel numb all the time and as if someone took the wind out of their sales.     When someone is hypermanic -they usually have a climatic point this where it is most dangerous as some end up self destructing -then they crash into depression.    I have found that when people adjust their meds according to the season -it really makes a difference. They just have to have a doctor who is willing to work with them and many won't.     They prefer to keep their patients on dose all the time and this become frustrating as it takes that drive and motivation away.    I say do what it inspires you but do it in steps as others in here have just mentioned.If you become frustrated with something - step away from it go take a walk or do some sort of physical activity to burn off some energy.    Save your work and write down your intentions before you stop, so you will know where to start when you come back-kind of like bookmarking if you will.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Sure, I feel an intense need to create. What I've found is that you really have to capture inspiration when it comes and hold off on the work until you have time to complete it. You can't control inspiration but you can control the time you spend on the work. If I jumped into the work every time the inspiration hit, I'd never sleep or get another thing done.     Keep a notebook and when you're inspired, write the idea down. Schedule a time for yourself to work and then stick to the schedule.     It also sounds to me like your bi-polar has you all over the place and unable to concentrate on one creative activity. It's perfectly okay to shelf certain things for later and try to focus on one thing.     What is it that you most want to accomplish?    Pick your absolute favorite creative activity and only work on that for a couple of weeks. If you have other inspirational thoughts, keep writing them down and then focus on another activity for a couple of weeks.     Would the art be better if you were not running off to play piano or write? Would the piano get better if you were not distracted by the drawing?    You can't do it all at once. Concentrate on intense, focused work on one thing at a time.|`|AA11229410	Like being bipolar expression is a duality.  You can have the passion for self or to give or receive from others.  Being driven comes from the payoff.  The payoff can be anything.  Money, acceptance or contribution are all ways anyone can feel compelled to express.  You just have to make sure that you are being truthful with yourself and not using it as escapism.  A doctor can't balance your emotions for you.  They can only give you drugs to mask immaturity and distress.|`|wkK5JDz4aa	I would say yes and no.  Not immediately after the thought or idea is conceived,  But after it is perfected.    Eventually they come out.
0uMLrKAbaa	wel. . . this is normal.  to gain more confidence, do everything step by step . . .  try to talk to girls . . . on cell phone first. . . . and then meet them!  everything will be fine dont worry!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Spend more time around the girls.  They will show you what they want and they expect you give to them.  Don't worry.  You will soon get the hang of it.  If it don't work out the first time, try it again,  Just tell her something had you distracted and make up something not related to a relationship or experience with another person. Late car payment, rent due, etc...  Forget what had you distracted.
4vG9ys8paa	if it was gender-swapped, I would probably forgive her depending on how long ago it happened. If it was, say, last week, then obviously no. But if it was something that happened like 20 years ago and nothing had happened since then I would probably say yes if I really loved her. I would also consider that at least they were up front about it, whereas if they were planning to keep on being a sex offender they would likely keep their past a secret. Also, I would be less threatened by the fact that it was "consensual" and not forceful. The fact that she became a chrisitan probably wouldn' affect me. Of couse, I would be more likely to get up and leave them at the slightest sign.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	A sexual offence is not a mistake. But regardless of that I'd never go out with a christian!!|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	I would not marry anyone with a criminal past.|`|aaRMPDIDaa	I don't think I could no|`|HmNqCDsQaa	No Christians for me, but I get your question, and I think it would depend on how old he was when he got caught.  If it was last week, I'd say no thanks.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	It would depend completely on him and whether he actually has changed.  The age he had sex with the 14 year old girl would also play a big factor.  Being with someone for 2 years and feeling like you love them is one thing... finding out you don't know them is going to put a big strain on that.  He should have told me before the 2 year mark.  Forgiveness and the truth don't set you free if you keep it bottled up for the whole relationship.|`|Q3wDaHITaa	Absolutely not. A 30 year old man sleeping with a 14 year old girl is completely repulsive to me. I would not be able to forgive this.     On a side note I would also never marry a christian as their ideals do not match mine.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Know what? I actually laughed reading this question. Brilliant !     I would say it depends on the individual woman in question. I guess women will more likely run away from an ex-offender  then they would from a Christian ? Ha ha :-)|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Absolutely not!  As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of an allegedly religious person, that is a definite dealbreaker for me.      In fact, I'll take it a step further. People should always do background checks on any potential date to rule out stuff like this. That way you don't wind up "accidentally" falling in love with such evil miscreants who really don't care about you...but who are actually manipulating things to suit their purposes!    As a single mother, I also think that people should be especially careful who they allow into their lives. Because those sorts of perverts oftentimes deliberately seek out single moms because they think those families are more vulnerable...and the kids wind up being easy targets for the molester.    Sure, God does forgive, but that person STILL has to pay for what they did.  Remember, the Bible also teaches that what someone sows, they reap! It also says that a person may steal out of hunger, but they STILL have to pay back 7 times what they stole!    No matter how many justifications someone will make in this case...for most people being a "Christian" or religious person still doesn't excuse or erase the fact that he is indeed a registered sex offender...a criminal...and that he could STILL do it again.      Basically, there's no such thing as a "former" Sex Offender. Once one, always the potential to be one!  According to the US Department of Justice, sex offenders have a high recidivism rate, in fact the HIGHEST of all crimes. This means they are most likely to repeat their offenses.  Why should someone take that risk?    Also, psychologically, sex offenders tend to have issues with narcissism and are generally sociopaths who don't think they did anything wrong.    Knowing this, why would or SHOULD I or anyone else want to enter an intimate relationship with such a person?  Do that, and you're inviting heartbreak and criminality into your life.  What if you and the pervert have children? What's to stop him from molesting YOUR children?  Better to be safe than sorry...and better to spend your life alone than marry a DEGENERATE!    No.  Sex offenders should be locked away FOR life...if not executed!!!    BTW 14 years old, no matter what they say, cannot legally give consent in ANY state.  Sex with a minor is called statutory rape...so quit twisting things around like this.  Even if the 14 year was allegedly "enticing" you and explicitly said they wanted to have sex, you should've STIILL said no...and got away from them!  You as the ADULT are the one who has the legal and moral responsibility to draw the line and do what is legally right in that circumstance!!!|`|dGwa8sFPaa	No, I would never date a christian.|`|YQOT68xFaa	That would depend on how old he was when he did that. I know I'd have a hard time dealing with that. I don't know what I'd end up doing.      Wow, it's sad that so many women care more about the fact that he's a Christian than about the fact that he's a registered sex offender. Talk about prejudice.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Sleeping with a 14 year old girl would bother me less than him being a devoted Christian.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I don't at all believe in this concept of forgiveness and being absolved of all sin. There are some things that are absolutely unforgivable to me.     He had two years to tell me and he never thought it was important enough to drop it sooner? Why? Because it's not quite as innocent as he's saying it was?    I think at 14 someone can definitely consent, but I'd need an awful lot more details to get a feeling whether she actually had or not. I'd also want to know how old he was when this happened, if he was too old by my standards then I'd have to question what kind of man would he have been to have been interested in someone that much younger than him.    There's a chance it would all turn out to be no big deal for me, like if he were 17 maybe and they'd been in a relationship and had sex as well, I may feel comfortable with that.     It's hard to think of any circumstances where I wouldn't think he was pretty immature and maybe kinda ****** up too. The fact he waited so long to tell me would put me on edge though regardless of the details. Especially since I always ask about any sort of criminal record. That'd mean he lied to me for quite a while. I doubt I'd just 'get over it' =o)|`|z60J0Z9Daa	She was 14 and he was...how old at the time?? think that would make a difference. 18? 25? 42?    but no I'm not into Christians.    30? o.0 No.  he knew what he was getting into...there are limits to statutory rape.  Sometimes it's just ridiculous...like with an 18 year old. But 30, 16 year difference not cool.  He knew he was dating a child, significantly less mature and less experienced then him.   relationship would be over at that point.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Absolutely not.    I am an Atheist.|`|rpajoT0raa	I'd play it very cool and say I needed some space to think about it. Then I'd hack into his computer, find all his pervert files and emails, call the cops and hand over the computer to them.  The End.    I would never for one moment consider a future with someone capable of such creepiness. It is possible to completely fall out of love with someone in a split second.|`|AA11530601	depends how old he ws when he did it, if he was 30 when he slept with her then I would find him hard to trust. he might be Christian but that does not mean he dosent have issues.|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Absolutely not. I dated one in the 90s who went to prison for rape with a weapon. After he got out he swore he was a changed man, found God, and was never, ever going back. Things didn't work out with us, thankfully. He married some years ago and I recently discovered through my net spying that he had committed rape again and spent a few more years in jail. I would say that the prison system doesn't do a very good job of rehabilitating criminals. I don't care if it was consensual sex or rape with a weapon, the offender knew it was a crime and did it anyway. With so many other fish in the sea, why bother with this ****?|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Only if when this guy  WAS 15 WHEN he was dating the 14 yr old...one does not change their sexual preference or orientation...nuff said...problem will arise again...
s6MsrhIJaa	2 ways.   1) by selling US bonds to foreign countries such as China ( a bond is basically a long term 5-10year+ IOU). this is what people call 'borrowing'.  these IOU's have to be paid that is why some people here say that their kids will be paying this money back..it's true. their income taxes will go to pay off these IOU's instead of going to keep schools/hospitals/roads/bridges/sewage and water systems in good condition.   2) by literally printing the money from a machine! true. this is not good as this effectively devalues all the dollars that already exist in the world including the ones you and your folks have in the bank. can cause (and probably will) high inflation. why? because as each dollar is now worth less, people who sell you stuff (imports from say Europe) want more of them from you so that when they turn them back into their own currency they get the price they used to get before the printing began. that word in the last sentence 'more' means inflation to the person who pays, you and me.|`|IApsG1f1aa	They are getting the money from our tax dollars.|`|WgruZkHRaa	China your children will be slaves to them.

It COMPETES with your spending so drives up prices and discourages productivity.  - The Wiemar Republic is the last economy that did anything on this sort of scale. Read about it and you'll start caching valuables against the day a box of corn flakes goes to $50,000.  - Policy makers in D.C. KNOW this. It is/will not be an "unintended consequence;" it's the plan. Obama said so on TV and radio. The Wiemar experience is his operating manual.
yj3GT7jOaa	Before you begin, focus on one person in the room.  Do not let them see you do it.  Use your peripheral vision.  Don't look directly at anyone.  Always look in their general direction, without using to much side to side head movement.  Looking side to side should come by turning the body, not your head.  Stay focused on the one person you chose as much as possible.  Practice in an empty room with the same lyrics you will be using.   Watch other performers with the volume on mute.  Don't imagine their words; use yours.   You will do okay.    Also remember to take a short breath  air to hold for a little bit before you begin.  Don't hold it too long.

Some of these "two many" things may be more important than others, some may need immediate attention and some may not be concerned about for months. We all have front burners and back burners. Put the things on the back burner that you don't have to worry about today and meet the immediate challenges head on and with confidence. Do you know the main reason for letting things get out of hand and stacking up? Not, handling the problem as soon as it is recognized. Learning how to pay your bills early, get your school work done ahead of time, get to your appointments before being called etc, are all things that will prevent this from happening.

fDGPbwdsaa	There is no question about it.    Feminist groups also manage police training on domestic violence, so they get the opportunity to paint d/v as a one-way street during the crucial moments in a police officer's training.    I have spoken with police officers (that I know personally), and some swallow it whole without blinking - while others know that reality begs to differ from their training. Nonetheless, they are told that it is a 'men beating women' issue, rather than the truth.        ETA: Untamed Rose - I agree with you that 'popping a toddlers hand is not violence' - but I'm willing to bet that you swallow the stats that say alike to "men commit 99% of violence", even if you KNOW that the definition of 'violence' has been diluted to "he looked at me nasty" or "he said f*ck" and such like. One of the winning formulae for feminist lies has been to redefine words so that even innocent actions of men are considered abusive (yet somehow, identical actions from women to men are considered justified or innocent).|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Think ?! I am convinced that Feminist groups manipulate ALL statistics for no reasons whatsoever !    The 2009 Agenda on the NOW website states this :     "End federal funding of untested marriage promotion programs and "fatherhood" programs that take funding away from the parent who is actually raising the children in need"    Now, how do we explain their coming to the conclusion that "fatherhood" programs are bogus? Do only mothers raise children ? What statistics did they use to come to these conclusions ?|`|cWxwHMQWaa	With something as secretive and often well-hidden as abuse, I have no idea what kind of person would actually believe in them.    I'm not a stats fan whatsoever, I don't find them reliable for anything emotional or linked with relationships because these are personal/private matters and how can we put this into valid numbers? Makes no sense to me.    In any case, people who are inclined to us BS arguments aren't always feminists. Feminists haven't cornered the market on it, don't worry haha =o)    There's often things tacked onto feminism that I'm all too swayed to believe. That said, I admit to having no knowledge of what 'modern feminists' are doing, so it's possible the antis are right and it's all a huge conspiracy to target men and lead to women having supremacy.    I really doubt it though.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	ALL pressure groups fiddle statistics for their gain. Statistics mean NOTHING!|`|z60J0Z9Daa	How do you know your source is any more accurate then the other ten thousand sources out there?    I wont argue that female to male DV, happens, or that it's under reported and under estimated.   Also wont argue that some mothers do abuse thier childern.   but there are so many different sources on the internet, all saying different things.   It's like false rape reports, are 2% false or 94% I can find sources for both.  I'm inclined to believe the larger sources like the FBI files, or somewhere in the middle of it all.     and that last one 82%...Thats just straight up BS.  Are they counting mommy popping a toddles hand as violence?|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	Everyone manipulates statistics for political purposes.|`|pYimIJAWaa	If anything, law enforcement agencies manipulate the statistics by not properly following up on domestic violence issues (and so not having many of them even 'counted' in the official stats).    btw. that whole 'men being inherently more violent than women' thing is a complete Ignoratio Elenchi - "red-herring" - argument. Shame on you for sinking to that.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	No they do so for goverment funding. You see, "concerned feminists" do not work for free, they work for money and their only source is goverment spending, therefore they must convince the goverment of a need for their services.|`|ILeHr73Baa	yes they lie|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	No they don't manipulate statistics- but you certainly have.  Rose is right on......|`|8T6WspX6aa	Okay, so you are upset that women right's group are going after men who abuse their families, you turn around and BLAME WOMEN?    No, sorry we do not learn violence from our mothers. And I do happen to know some people who were abused by the men in their families, not the women. So yes it does happen and it is the men's fault, not the horrible influence of women (rolls eyes).    And do you seriously use the excuse...women hit first? Seriously, that kindergartner logic.    News flash, there is NO gender war. There are Men who commit horrible acts and there are Women who commit horrible acts. And even more upsetting, there are children who commit horrible acts of violence.     We just have to rely on the decent men and women in the world to put an end to the violence.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I don't know what I would have to gain politically by inventing statistics. I volunteer for an org that supports abused women and we just help the ones that keep showing up. We don't even use stats in our fundraising other than the number of women that have used the centre's resources.    The stats you're posting are simply to be inflammatory. More women abuse their children because more women are in custody of children. What really matters is helping people when they need help, not quibbling over stats and studies.    And Cassius: This concerened feminist does work for free. Unfortunalely landlords don't rent meeting spaces for free, neither is printing, electricity or phone lines so funding is necessary. But there is enough proof that the services are needed too so why make up or twist stats?|`|WkLJI40baa	Any statitics used in a social science study (but really should be called surveys) should be questioned. The issue is when you question a feminist sponsored study you are called ignorant and that you hate women.    A recent interaction I had with a feminist here.    Me: So you really think 1 in 3  women at college are raped?  Fem: It is true, just look at the studies  Me: Do you think it would be safe to spend your daughter to college  Fem: Of course, the universities are safe    I refused to continue to debate twisted logic like that.|`|07pFe78Maa	the situation is women are the instigators of all the problem that man have been fighting for.. and the women are looking for a place in the future for their total control of everything and further they are breeding like wild fire to go at all extremes to just topple the generation of men in the society. they want a total women dominance.|`|c63014ce9b85eb8bdd0726c77c00b44caa	You are kidding right?! Again the concept of men not taking responsibilityy for what they do. While all statisticss are skewed to further the agenda of the person that is presenting the data,(as with yours) but domestic violence needs to be put in the front. Men don't report domestic violence as often as women do. But would you please stop trying to pretend like women are trying to perpetrate a fraud so that they can get some sort of attention. Men never want anything to change their way of life, some men have the ability to turn things around when they are out on the hot seat. Put your wee wee back in your pants a focus on domestic violence and stop pointing fingers. Domestiic violence no matter the victim or the ofender is horrible, shocking, disturbing and traumatic so please let's keep our eyes on the ball.
xxq5JAM6aa	Look to the Great Depression for an answer. Millions lost their jobs thru layoffs. The economy tanked. The Depression did not end until WW II, financed with massive government spending on war material.     The 'stimulus' money being proposed is a drop in the bucket compared to the spending on WW II, adjusted for inflation. Just a bandaide.    That being said, I don't think we'll see a 2nd Great Depression. The world is an entirely different place now. Much more interconnected. We are gonna be in a long, deep recession, but moderated by a much more extensive 'safety net' than was available in the 30's.    Using the Dow as a gage for the end of the recession, I'd guess it'll be at least 5 years before it's back to the 11,000 range, and 15 before we see 14,000 again|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	I also agree with that, it would be more helpful to cut back on some of the employees perks such as company cars, company phones, company computers at their homes. Also decreasing the pay of high(over)paid employees. I'm sure people would much rather take a pay cut than lose their jobs.|`|8zyu6FWpaa	I agree with him.  Layoffs may help that particular company's bottom line at the time, but, in the long run, it hurts the economy as people begin to hoard more and spend less.  As we all know, spending money feeds the economic system and fuels its growth.  (And the news media doesn't help matters much either by their "Chicken Little" approach to reporting the gloom and doom.)    Good article, btw.  Thanks.|`|Q5D4CRFkaa	The sole purpose for Layoffs are for companies to save money by not paying those salaries. It only benefits the company. Laying off individuals hurt the economy as a whole because that means the more layoffs the more likely people will no longer be consumers. they can't afford it.

I could understand more if you were depressed if he just ignored you but he didn't hey? And your also depressed because everyone 'seems' to 'hate' you because of that? Why would anybody? Maybe some are jealous you were talking to him I mean if your basing that on the fact that people look at you in a certain way or whatever. You need confidence to over come these problems you ovbviously ain't got any if you have no close friends.

xxq5JAM6aa	It will get much worse before it begins to improve. Probably last at least 5 years.    We're in recession because people have quit spending, either out of fear or because they couldn't borrow any more.    The underlying cause for this was greed, corruption, and federal ineptitude promoted by Republicans and aided by Democrates.     President Hoover, a Republican, presided over the beginning of the Great Depression. President Bush, a Republican, presided over the beginning of the Great Recession.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	people got scared from all the news broadcasts and stopped spending money like they used too.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Grossly overpopulating cultures making labor ever cheaper.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	Flipping new Development homes, now they have flopped.

They went so far as to announce on TV and radio they were going to do it, how they would do it and when they would pull the trigger.  This recession is a deliberate Democrat program - according to Congressional Democrats.  The currency is being devalued - deliberately. It will get worse because it isn't nearly as bad as their plan calls for yet. Think "Wiemar Republic."  There is a sense of urgency developing since there are signs it is nearing the bottom and will begin a recovery if they don't act fast to prevent it.  The "stimulus package" is in fact written to deepen and prolong the recession, sending it into "Great Depression" territory and beyond.  It's all been done before and economic deprivation is ALWAYS the result - no exceptions. It isn't a guess, it's a history report.|`|gfK92OzUaa	the constant Boom/bust cycles are unnatural in a free market economy.    the FEDERAL RESERVE causes these artificial boom/bust cycles by manipulating interest rates and money supply.  this creates fake booms of artificial wealth (stock market, housing). And it inevitably has to bust.  (they caused stock market bubble in 1929 and in 2000 and housing bubble with monetary policy).  They cause inflation, a free market system is NOT supposed to have inflation, prices are supposed to go down over time.      Recessions are a good thing in general though for a free market system, they wash out the excesses, ie: too many people were spending and not savings over the last 2 decades (and capitalims needs savings for re-investment and more production to increase quality of life) so people need to save money and stop spending to help future economic growth, unfortunately the "stopping consumption" aprt when people stop spending hurts the economy in the short run, but it HAS to happen...and you get a recession which sets the stage for future economic growth.    We have been avoiding recession for decades and will pay severely for that, all these stimulus packages will only make the inevitable worse.    This is a depression BTW.|`|3SWjKcAEaa	Sales of housing plummeted drastically.|`|R2XDlMqTaa	a bunch of greedy crooks in washington(politicians and wallstreet)|`|GwQevn2Gaa	Charging low income people too high interest rates on   inflated house values.

This is especially true for the housing market.  Individuals were borrowing money to purchase houses (at over inflated prices) with loans that had adjustable interest rates.  Everything was fine and dandy until interest rates went up.  The rising interest rates increased these home owners monthly house payment (sometimes double their original payment).  The result: people began walking away from houses they could not afford.  Banks had loaned millions/billions to such individuals and are now not being paid back the money they had loaned out.  Banks usually get their money from other banks and investors.  This created a giant domino effect that has now impacted almost every sector.      To make matters even worse, housing prices have dropped dramatically.  In some of the worst parts of the U.S. house prices have dropped by more than 50% compared to a few years ago.  If you owned a house today that you bought for $300,000 would you want to continue making the payments knowing the house next door is on the market for $150,000?  A lot of people that can still afford their current payment are even walking away!    Many factors will shape the American and Canadian currency moving forward.  I believe that other countries may do less trade with the U.S. in the future because so much of the U.S's actions have impacted the rest of the world.  This could cause the American currency to devalue.      Many say the recession will get worse.  Some experts believe things won't begin to clean up until 4th quarter 2009.  At this point, however, it is difficult to say.|`|AA11426936	in1990 congress[controlled by a republican majority passed a law the the states can NOT interseed with the banking industry all controls were off  and banks could do what the like and greed came into the picture [reason given was you could buy a home with no money down[ creative financing] the banks could sell the shaky loans [no equityand no controlls] by packaging them with good loans to other financial instatutions like fanny may etc. no government regulation and the bottom fell out  and the banks tighten up credit on large corp. They couldn't borrow to expand and it was more profitable to lend money to the home industry|`|9D08eHn7aa	People thinking they deserved things when actually they didn't.  The American culture has moved from greatness to greed.  No one DESERVES anything you have to EARN it.  Roll-over debt allowed abundance to be shared by many... we all know not everyone can be wealthy.    So what led to the recession - overabundance in the average American's consumption basket.    What is prolonging the recession -  Americans returning to frugality.    Is America even the country that was once built upon values and hard-work?    Anyway the economists in charge of the Fed were taught that about rational behavior... but not greed.      Greed has never been in an economics equation, has it?|`|SpFB2x96aa	i dont know
iVpTdUL8aa	All guys hate confrontation. It depends on what you are talking about. If its a fault of his that your discussing then of course hes going to blow it off. If its an insecurity that you your self is having about you then he will probably try to make you feel better by making some crack that he thinks is funny and obviously it isn't . It could mean that he just doesn't like to talk about things or it could mean that he would rather talk to a buddy than girl friend. What ever it is that your talking about you need to make it clear to him that you are serious and want to resolve the issue. If he still blows it off then don't give up try bringing it up in a different way. If it involves another girl like you think shes making moves towards him then he more than likely will ignore it  or deny it. Its what guys do and you will have to try to get over it because it won't go away. It is just human nature to ignore what we don't want to deal with.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	confrontation  My greatest weakness.  I'm afraid to offend.

Or it could be that, you unknowingly crossed his boundaries, like u said, maybe he is not that into you because, he might feel that he is not prepared to respond to you, so he choose to back out.     well good luck and take care.
JPlVt9xYaa	I believe you and you are exactly right, and getting close to taken or married men is a very bad deal all the way around. Now, I did not email you to ask particulars so I will speak in general. Even though you are true and honest in your dealings with these friends, you will find there are some men who aren't and their attention toward you might be misconstrued by others and some unfounded blame might be aimed your way.    Be the good person that you are, be above this, don't let a good character be influenced by false accusations or appearances that are not what they seem. You know in your own heart what you feel, who you are and how to behave. You have demonstrated in your question that you definitely know right from wrong and I suggest you stick by it.
YMkf5Oh3aa	I have to say that a therapist requesting "closure" is a little odd. You are the client and it is your therapists job to help you. If you feel like she isn't doing her job well then just cancel your next session and seek out someone new. The way she responds to your problems does not seem very helpful or ethical. Also, a therapist job is to not give you "solutions" to your problems but he/she can give you suggestions and explain the "what ifs" to those suggestions. Find someone new - there is no need for closure. The new therapist can request your file for you so you won't even have to deal with her. If she calls you at home then let the answering machine do its job.|`|4Z5T98pKaa	it sounds like she may want to get a fix on why you want to leave. Maybe she thinks it will do you good to just not leave.    When a therapist says "what else is new" but doesn't tell you the solution, is that your definition of a therapist? They tell you the solution? YOU have to find the solutions. She may help. When you stop going to a therapist, there won't be anyone around to tell you the solutions. You have to use the therapist to learn how to learn.    Therapy can sometimes be frustrating. Sometimes you wonder what you are paying them for. I think they are there to elicit your thoughts and problems...and solutions.|`|wRPuGTHMaa	It sounds strange that she says that she needs closure.  If you're going to her for a specific reason (i.e. specific mental disorder) she may believe she can still help you.  If you're going to talk out problems with someone, it's weird that she's trying to keep you.  There wouldn't be anything to have closure about since it's just talking.  The thing is, she can't really give you a solution.  She can give you suggestions.  I'm surprised she's telling you why you have that problem as opposed to encouraging you to realize it yourself.  Hmm...I would leave her because that's what you want to do.  She shouldn't be restraining you like that.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	tell her the next time is your last time! and that's her closure!

Lesbians actually have the lowest rate of STDs so I think guys are involved in this somewhere, no?

That's why nobody likes their picture but thinks everyone else looks okay.  Get a picture of you that you don't like too much.  Then hold it up to the mirror.  You'll notice the reflection looks fine.|`|AA10988215	Unless the mirror is warped in some way you do appear the same in a mirror as you do to other people!    However, this does not mean that different people will see you in exactly the same way as you see yourself.  Whilst your physical characteristics will be the same, people can fixate on and study different parts of their own and other peoples bodies.  For example, when we get a spot, we see it in the mirror and it looks huge and we just think "oh, everyone is going to be looking at my spot" because we don't like it and so we fixate on it-it's all we see when we look at ourselves.  Other people are not so bothered by our spots and so some may barely notice it as they are looking elsewhere, such as in our eyes, instead of on our chin!    Psychological disorders such as anorexia are the perfect (albeit extreme) example of this.  The individual finds constant flaws in their body which they fixate on, whereas other people looking at them are not fixating on these flaws (if they even are flaws) and so cannot understand the individuals upset at their body.    Good for you for feeling happy at what you see in the mirror.

fkBZxZvCaa	Katie, I'm sorry you're feeling this way.   *hugs*      I completely understand.  I've been there.  I don't think you have social anxiety.      It DOES sound like you have severe depression.  You need to share your feelings with somebody you can trust, a person who will not judge you.      If you are feeling suicidal, you need to talk about it.   There is a website called Depression Forum that you can check out if you're interested.   The people on there are very helpful.      It sounds like you're really unhappy and you don't enjoy life anymore.  At least you reached out to your mom...you recognize that there is a problem and you want to be helped.   That is the first step.         I attend university.   I have only 1 class online.   I wish all of my classes were online so I wouldn't have to deal with anyone.   I can relate to what you are saying.      But please don't give up on yourself.   You sound like a very intelligent, kind person.  It is normal to be frustrated with life and to feel hopeless.       The good news is that you can do something about it.  Your mom needs to find you a compassionate therapist who can listen to you and help you resolve these feelings.  Your mom loves you and wants to help you.   Don't be afraid of being judged or misunderstood.   Be honest about your feelings.      *Jan...I can relate to you, too.   I have always felt that most  people dislike me.   I know for a fact that it is not all in my mind.  Life is incredibly difficult.   You are perfectly right.   If she doesn't seek help, it could become worse.   I am 26 and my depression is still here.   It went untreated.   I didn't have the best therapy, either.   And no one was understanding of my situation.|`|xYnz7Jefaa	You need to get help... Talk to someone who can tell you why you feel this way. I am 32 y/o and still feel that way. I have felt that way for as long as I can remember and don't know why myself. I have more learned to deal with it. My thing is more worrying about what others are thinking of me. However, I didn' have a good childhood and was made to feel bad about myself and I feel that is where my problem came from.   You sound young (still in school) don't let the problem go any longer. It will not go away...  Talk to your parents so they can find you help. I wish I was able to get help then. Now my husband sees things in me such as he says I think everyone is looking down on me or thinking bad things about me. I don't like to spring up friendships because I constantly feel like I'm be judged.   So the short of it........ get you someone to talk to that can explain and know the reason you are feeling this way. You can also think long and hard about your life and find out what is making you feel this way or what has happend to make you feel this way and learn to deal with as I have.

An inability or unwillingness to socialise can be a symptom of many mental illnesses, but are most commonly linked to four. These are Asperger's Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.    I suggest you research these disorders, and if you feel you have any symptoms that match up, you contact your local mental health service.

fkBZxZvCaa	You will always encounter people who think they are better than you.   This is a fact of life.      However, you need to be secure within yourself.  Don't feel bad because of somebody else's bullsh*t.    Many people are insecure.  It sounds like this "actor" has a superiority complex.  There will always be people who judge you without trying to know you.      It happens to me all the time.   There are MANY people who look down on me and think that they are better than me.          What you need to do is be proud of who you are.   Don't try to impress others or compete with anyone.  You are an individual with strengths and weaknesses...just like everyone else in this world.      Not everyone will like you.  Not everyone will understand you.  Not everyone will accept you.   This is a fact of life.         Work on accepting yourself.  Work on impressing YOURSELF.   No one is superior or inferior to anyone.      F*ck the haters.   Be happy and successful by doing things that you love.   Show your unique talents and skills.

I have been around for almost 100 years and I am still friends with my pals from grade school.    Often our attitude is a reflection of how we perceive ourselves and how other perceive us. There is not such thing as one person being better than another nor a person being less than another, we are all children of the universe and as such, we are a complete and extreme variety.    It is difficult to grow up without friendships, but a true understanding of the differences in human nature teaches us that we are not matched to all others and often not matched to someone that we really admire. Being a teacher for many years, I find that some of my most companionable friends were once my students, now all grown up and with kids of their own. To look back over my life, my friends, and my experiences, I can honestly say, that true and wholesome friendships are a blessing and not a headache as you have described.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	How do you deal with people who think they're better than you? - easy let them think they are better then me!

ASXeYOjAaa	Keep voting Democrat and you'll see.  A real "crash" is only possible through government manipulation. That's also what prevents recovery so the two would go together since they have the same cause.  There was a global recession in the early 20th Century. After our government moved to "fix" it we went into a depression. The rest of the World calls it that. WE call it "The Great Depression" because it dragged on longer and deeper HERE than everywhere else since our government CAUSED it.  Today, they are doing their best to make it happen again, but much, much worse.  WWII did NOT get us out of it as many claim. Specific indicators improved - productivity was up due to government spending on the war and unemployment went down due to spending LIVES on the war but the standard of living got WORSE, not better.  Substantial improvement came (and FAST) only in the post-war years when government backed OUT of the economy a LOT.|`|i3g2aidcaa	We would be in a similar situation as we were during the great depression - unemployment would soar and people would suffer greatly - it would take another event like WW II to get us out of such a mess.

LEixu90naa	Each one if us.     There are many factors that have brought the economy to it's knees. Think about what WE have done. Over extended our credit. Borrowed more than we can pay back. Asked for home loans that we thought we could handle (secretly e know it was a stretch because many had a bad credit history for a reason).    I KNOW that not every person behaved irresponsibly. Many companies took serious advantage of peoples willingness to act irresponsibly.    I look at it this way. A 17 year old kid can ask an adult to buy them alcohol. The kid and the adult know that it's wrong, but, they figure that the other person is capable of making these decisions for themselves. So the adult in enabling the irresponsible kid to make bad decisions. Where does the blame lie??? With both parties.    People had bad credit scores (the kid) and companies had money to loan (adult). The companies loaning the money took advantage for monetary gain regardless of poor credit ratings. The kids took advantage of this (knowingly) and then, when the stuff hit the fan and they couldn't pay.....taxpayers are stuck holding the bag.    Here is my other gripe. When my kids do something wrong, they pay the NATURAL  CONSEQUENCE. When companies and home make bad decisions, they should pay the natural consequence instead of being rescued!!! Yes, the economy will suffer as a result. BUT, that is where good old fashioned American ingenuity comes in and figures an innovative answer for the problem. Now our government is solving the problem (poorly I might add) and no one is learning the lesson that needs to be learned. So all parties are rescued only to go out and do it again.|`|PI1S0PLUaa	Deregulation|`|AcWMpmPwaa	US!!      not u.s.|`|ld1vh7nHaa	congress|`|pUUyYz4gaa	Part of it IS the business cycle, and part of it is us.

84gK4XlHaa	First of all, putting Palin in the same category as Pelosi and Clinton just because she has a vagina just proves that you have no idea what you're talking about.  All three women have significantly different backgrounds ,and Clinton and Pelosi operate under a completely different ideology than Palin.  You don't need a gender studies lesson so much as a political science lesson.  I don't compare George Bush to Jimmy Carter and then ask when men will be able to lead.  Also, you clearly had your eyes shut and your ears plugged for 6 months if you didn't catch any sexism in Clinton's campaign coverage.  Did you notice that they criticized her first for acting too much like a man and then for acting too much like a woman?  How are you supposed to win with logic like that?    Edit:  Okay, my bad.  We're ready to lead now.  Clinton would have made a good president, better than McCain anyway.  There are also women leading all over the world in 2009.  If you're going to lump us all together with no regard to partisanship or ideology anyway, then why leave out women like Angela Merkel just because they're not in the US?|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Hate to break it to you but these women and many others are leading segments of the country.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Hopefully the rest of the US is a little more evolved and not so hopelessly hung up on gender as you are.    Pelsoi may have critics. Who in her job hasn't. Clinton ran a great campaign. Considering the popularity of Obama she did very well and outlasted several other men.    Palin is no more likely to 'bounce a baby' while at work than any other president or employee for that matter. That's just plain stupid to even suggest it.    The reason there are not more women in powerful positions in the US is that there are simply not as many in the running as there are men, and secondly, a few too many voters still have the intelligence of cavemen.|`|HmNqCDsQaa	They are ready to lead.  Just watch Mrs.Clinton.  She's not done yet.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	First, there is no one "specific" mind state for any gender. Ask a thousand people the same question, you'll get a thousand answers.  No one can reasonably determine the "mind state" of an entire gender...whether male or female. We're individuals...not our chromosomes and genitalia.    Secondly... ok, so maybe you don't like the current women politicians...that's fine. That's your perogative. Still,  it doesn't mean that NO woman can lead...that's not a logical statement.    Thirdly.  Consider this as a possible reason why there allegedly isn't a good 'female' leader.  Perhaps we missed out on having the "right" female leader due to past sexism and discrimination...so she never got her chance to shine....or perhaps the "right" female leader is still waiting to be born.      Either way, you never know.... so don't discount this gender yet. Don't forget the saying, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world!    Also, if the woman leader fails, she fails.  Better for her to try and to fail than to never have the opportunity to lead simply because she is a female and the men feel threatened by this.    Besides, much of the MALE leadership all over the world hasn't been all that stellar...and I can give you a whole list of male leadership "failures"  but I'd use up a lot of bandwidth in the process lol.  Just Google dictators and despots and you'll see the majority of them are MEN, not women!|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I doubt that any of these three would make a good president. (Especially Palin. Not for being the mother of a baby less than a year old, but for being an IDIOT.) Condoleezza Rice would be great at it, but I'm not comfortable at all with how willingly she did Bush's bidding; she's probably a little too much of a hawk. Perhaps Dianne Feinstein or Barbara Boxer would make a good one.|`|RpHewn8gaa	The problem is that most women who seek power in politics do so out of an liberal activist political agenda (like Pelosi and Clinton). Those that are not are visciously attacked by those liberal activists who want to ensure the victim status of women (as was the case with Palin). We're left with very few quality choices.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	By the sounds of it you feel the republicans are conservative in financial things, yet the past republican administrations ran up huge debts, admittably to bolster the economy and stock markets.    I think the main problem with the us is that America is very much involved in defense. People want to see somebody who would be subject to the draft himself on top, not a woman. Also there are safety concerns. The military does not exactly get its doors run in by new recruits, serving under a woman might keep even more away, telling recruiters to go recruit some more girls.    And what Fem said, most women in a good position aremore concerned about pursuing their feminist goals instead of running the country.

Or are you thinking to pretend to be someone you're not for the rest of your life to maintain values that you took off a website but which are not necessarily yours?    During courtship, you should uphold the values that you find important to you. If the person you're with shares those values, then he/she will continue the relationship, which might one day lead to marriage. If you don't share the same values, better to find out early on so that both of you can move on to others who are better suited to you.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	"Don't be a dick."

There's a big snowfall, someone dies, a package arrives, you get a job out of town.    Some people may evaluate the event in a positive way, some negative. Some may think the event has both pluses and minuses. These thoughts, or evaluations, will affect further thoughts, feelings, and behaviour.

The approach is particularly interested in overt behaviour, particularly behaviour that can be tested and/or measured.    Cognitive psychology includes all those processes that go on in the brain e.g. memory, attention, perception (the interpretation of sensory information), thinking, problem-solving and language ability. These can be indirectly investigated using research e.g. experiment and observation.    Social learning theory, which has its roots in the behavioural approach, does include cognitive processes between the stimulus and the response.    Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) uses aspects of the behavioural approach as well as aspects of cognition.

OdoLSDlXaa	You've got a lot of negative feelings built up over the years and they just don't go away because things are getting better.  You have to express your anger, disgust, resentment toward the proper source.  Tell your therapist, friend, family member how mad you are about the incidents in the past and how your parents were lame at parenting.  That is a good start.    I would look for an alternative school, rather than get home-schooled.  You need to expand your social interactions and spend more time out of the house away from your immediate family.  Friends and therapist may be safer than family for that.  Family react a lot differently when there is a therapist in the room, so you can try that too.     I know you don't like talking about your feelings, but you need to do that more and more to vent the negative emotions and heal emotionally from the past.|`|C0yagFFoaa	i dont undestand, the question, sorry, what exactly are you writing , thinking about, lot sof people fear those things. unless you like writing about them, but th epolice should arrest them if you press charges.|`|AA10023809	It is pretty typical for teens to be curious about such things.

gkqSk29Zaa	Fear controls you when you decide not to face it and overcome it.|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	It is us. Being your self is not a shame, it is fact.|`|c2b69802ef9d960e8e16708b4ecfdc15aa	It would depend on what those fears are, how viable they are within the parameters of one's individual lifestyle and where they came from.    If they are genuine, sensible fears that warn us away from real dangers, then they have great protective value, but if they are seemingly needless and address no realistic threat, they can cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety and stress - which is something we can ALL do without!    Still, if we examine them objectively, they can tell us a lot about ourselves.  As a firm believer in reincarnation and spirituality, I can see, in my own inner fears, much potentially valuable information about my past-life history that I cannot actively and consciously recall.  For instance, the nearest thing I probably have to a genuine phobia is a creepy, crawly fear at the sight of a submerged shipwreck in a movie or on a TV show.  Coupled with a natural attraction to coastal areas and all the trappings of a maritime culture, the message from that one is obvious - I probably "went down with the ship" in some past life.      However, I know that an obscure fear like that of an object i am never likely to encounter in this lifetime is vastly different than a crippling fear of somethiing one mightr commonly encounter every day.  If you - or anyone else you may be writing about in this question, have such a problem, I would suggest you get help with it ASAP.    I am NOT recommending traditional psychology/psychiatry, though.  I read somewhere many years ago that traditional psychotherapy has a 3% cure rate - which, if true, equates to a 97% FAILURE rate, and I would NEVER recommend THAT to anyone!  No, I would recommend a good clinical hypnotherapist.  He/she can probably help to find the root of those fears, and eliminate them.    For anyone who cannot find or afford this kind of help, then just go to   emofree.com  and download their free tutorial, then try their recommendations.  It won't cost anything and is supposed to be a really major help with this sort of thing.|`|YWQdsoOMaa	Our fears deserve to be faced and defeated.

10TrzsSraa	Stereotyping is a broader category than racism.  Racism is a subset of stereotyping.     Examples:    1. Women are too interested in money (Stereotype)       Jews are too interested in money (Racism)    2. Big men are slow and dumb.    (Stereotype)      Black men are slow and dumb. (Racism)    As you can see the difference is that racism makes a stereotype based on race, religion, or national origin whereas stereotyping can be based on any characteristic.    NOTE: Those are just examples. Shame on anyone who thinks those have any reality.|`|a7pCUHoiaa	If we had Caucasion/European-American Pride Day, unfortunately the other races (from what I've witnessed) would probably call us racist!  o.O    Yet, you don't have to look far to find holidays such as Cinco de Mayo: Day of Mexican Pride, and African-American History Month, etc.    Then again, I guess it would be fair to say we are the ones who have been racist against them in the past (i.e. Caucasion Europeans/-Americans kidnapping and marketing African slaves in the U.S., or American's "stealing" the land from the Mexicans in the U.S.-Mexican war, which was settled under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo)    As far as stereotyping someone, I wouldn't consider it racism.    My reasonomg is that, cuturally speaking, people of specific races are raised with a similar culture (controlled by pop culture, gangs, occults, and religious/other group's opinions as well as parental upbringing. This is the same for every society, race, ethnic clan, etc. It depends on how much that particular group of people are willing to change/evolove with [your standards by which your comparing them] that show's their (sometimes drastic or "unacceptable") sociological/cultural differences).    I think it's pathetic and unfortunate that anybody is still racist.  Why can't the world just "grow up" and respect each other? doesn't mean you have to praise those who are lesser individuals than yourself according your standards, but leave them alone/give them the respect they deserve!    As for the "n" and "b" words, that's a cultural thing as far as I know.    "If a brother [someone of the African-American race, and/or a friend in the gang he belonged to] uses the word, it's fine, but if a cracker http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph... uses it, he deserves to be shot" [I'm paraphrasing what an African-American gang member once said while smoking marijuana at a public recreation facility near my house as I was passing by]    Also, this might have to do with being culturally/otherwise accepted by a racial/cultural group other than your own. Some Latino/Mexican-Americans and African-American friends of mine allow me to (jokingly) call them "b" and "n", but generally I respect them and don't refer to them that way.    Hope this answers your question! (I've asked myself this question many times in the past, and this is what I've come up with thus far)|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Stereotyping is not racism, although sometimes it can cross the line.

Racism is like stereotyping on steroids with regard to a group of people.  Racism makes over-generalizations, usually negative, about an entire population based on physical or genealogical traits.  Any population is naturally diverse, and any stereotype, whether bad or good, will not accurately describe it's members.  And unlike most of the stereotypes we use in our everyday lives, racism is not based on our own experiences, but on a propagated mythology.  Racism usually involves dehumanizing the 'other', and in part, is a force to maintain solidarity within the racist group and power over the 'other' group.  As for racial slurs - appropriating them for use within the abused group takes away power from the racists.  That's why it depends on who uses the words on whom.  Use of racially charged words in-group will have a different meaning than inter-group usage.|`|EUAd4DUJaa	Stereotyping definitely isn't racism.    Stereotyping involves applying certain perceived traits of a group to anyone who might be a part of that group; like claiming that anyone who's into Star Trek or science fiction is a virgin, or believing that anybody from Mexico is a drug dealer and gang member.

You should really seek professional help, and soon, specifically for grief counseling.  It hasn't been that long, and our father's death was quite horrific, so it's no wonder you're depressed, but by talking to someone about it, it can help you a great deal.|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Sorry you lost your dad - sounds like a tough way to lose him. Be patient with yourself. It takes time to recover from a major loss like that. The fact that you are realizing that it is a difficult process, and reaching out for help is a good sign that you will eventually be able to deal with your loss in a healthy way. Seeing someone trained in grief counseling might be useful, especially if you still feel this way in a few months. You don't say how old you are, but if you are still in school, the school might have some counselors on staff. Some larger employers have this as well. But just talking to your friends and family about your feelings can be a big help too. If you are the type that likes to read about things and understanding things helps you, then reading Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's book "On Death and Dying" might help you.  But whatever you choose to do, don't pressure yourself to get over this too quickly - realize that the healing process can take a while. Best wishes on your road to recovery.|`|ebqQAzk1aa	It's only natural to miss your Dad. But try to think of the best things about him.

It's only been a month, so give yourself a break. I would venture to say that it's getting worse because initially you were probably in shock and denial, and as time goes by your grieving process has moved into an acceptance phase.     My suggestion is to see a doctor about possibly getting on antidepressants. They've really worked for me; I lost my mother in October. Keep in mind that it takes about 3 weeks for antidepressants to start working. You might also see a grief counselor.     I truly believe that time does heal all wounds, and that things will eventually get better for you.|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	That is so sad and heartbreaking. I am so so sorry for your loss.    I think you are being way to hard on yourself and expecting yourself to get over this tragedy much faster than you need to. It is going to take you years to truly digest it all and even then it will never completely go away or be all better. You will get to a place where you will learn to accept it and it won't hurt AS much, but this is not the kind of thing you just get over.    It makes total sense that you get worse before getting better because the more it sinks in and the more time you have without your father, the more you will hurt, at first.    There are many stages of grief and I think you should talk to someone who has a lot of experience with this kind of situation.    Don't try to deal with it all by yourself. Talk to others that have gone through something similar. There are support groups and therapy and many avenues to get help. You might even find a support group online with people that have dealt with a tragic loss themselves.    Please don't lose sight of whats beautiful about life. Death is an inevitable aspect of everyone's life, no exception. Some people are taken from us much more quickly, or tragically then we can understand. But the inevitability of everyone's death is also what makes life so precious. Try every single day to find even a moment of joy in your life.    Think of your dad and remember how much he loved you and wanted you to live. Live for your dad and always keep him in your heart.    All my condolences and sympathies.    ps PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANTIDEPRESSANTS. What you are experiencing is normal. Drugs will only make it worse and make it harder for you to go through the natural processes you need to. Don't cause more problems for yourself with unneeded medication.|`|AA11496527	When my Dad died it was the worst loss I had suffered in my life (up to that time), even though my family had time to say good bye in hospice it did not lessen the degree of loss when he finally passed, in fact his pain was so great during hospice I had secretly wished he would go sooner rather than later.     When he left I was emotional but attempted as best I could to muster up strength for my Mom. While doing this I felt I was getting over the depression of losing him rather fast, which I didn't think was a bad thing at the time. About two weeks after his death I was driving to work and started to think about him, the lump in my throat grew and finally the tears came. This must have been a moment I thought and when I got to work it was gone, however these symptoms came back every morning on my way to work and it was depressing me to a point that I thought I might need some help. It turned out, I believe, that these morning grief sessions actually helped me. I was able to talk to him, apologize for stupid things I had done when I was prepubescent (I know stupid), and even tell him I understood so much of life because of him.    This type of drive and grieve lasted for about six months and I believe it really helped me work through this time in my life. What I'm saying and really all that I am saying is you need to feel the loss, but there may be a time where it can be done better. I never had the immense sad feelings while at work or while I was busy doing something else, so I am suggesting to you to let your grief go, but try to make a time to do it. I believe that the grief is necessary but do not think it should overtake you life, get out there and do life but don't forget your Dad. Talk to him and remember him but don't forget to live.     You don't need drugs to get through this, I think it will make the depression last longer.

Y32zA5Mfaa	Actually, in humans sexual dimorphism is very low (look at gorilla and chimpanzee sizes...the males are much larger than the females).  It has been shown that in species with less sexual dimorphism, there is more of a trend of monogamy with both parents caring for the offspring (this is found in birds too, so it is not only limited to mammals).      So even if 'love' and 'marriage' did not have a role in humans, I do believe that humans would still lean toward monogamy, with the ultimate goal of mutual care of offspring.    That being said, we cannot discount the role that culture now plays in human societies.  In the societies that practice polygyny (many wives), polyandry (many husbands), or polygamy (many spouses) (all of which occur in other non-human species too!), there are cultural reasons behind their practices.  I believe in cultural relativity (that we should understand other cultures' practices from the viewpoint of their own culture, not ours), and if cultural relativity is used, there is nothing wrong with other cultures performing other forms of marriage and pairings.    So I guess my main point is that if we did not factor in culture and society, then humans as animals would still lean toward monogamy due to many factors, degree of sexual dimorphism included (as evidenced by studies in other non-human species).|`|HltEZkvQaa	The fact that people fall in love proves we are naturally monogamous.    Also the fact that men have a strong desire to look after their children.    But by far the most conclusive evidence comes from free love communes. what happened them all?    i'll tell you. People started falling in love and started feeling jealous that the person they loved was sleeping with everyone else. These communities were unsustainable and eventually they fell apart from the inside.    The problem is that love for a partner doesn't last indefinitely. This is because your children are more important than your partner. Naturally you would have kids and your love would transfer from your partner to your kids.    Unfortunately this is the part society has a problem with. Instead of rejoicing that they can feel such love for their children people care more about their sex lives and look for a new partner so they can relive the old experience of sexual love instead of embracing the new love for their children.    Anyway, back to dimorphism.    Women have larger hips because they need them for childbirth, this was essential to allow us to have bigger brains. This is the main difference, and pressures other than monogamy caused this to happen. Other than some differences in the way fat is distributed in our bodies humans aren't that dimorphic. The difference in height is a legacy of our polygamous past. That difference is decreasing, although i think it'll always be there to some extent, it's just not as pronounced as it was.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	There are more than subtle differences between human beings and our ancestors. We don't usually wish to go back...|`|YQOT68xFaa	I don't like the idea of using animals as a blueprint for human behaviour. I don't know about you...but I consider myself to be above animal behaviour. I'm not an animal who runs on instinct and bodily appetite. God gave humans a mind that functions on a much higher level than animals. We are more intelligent. We can know right from wrong. We have self-control. Why throw that away in favour of acting like an animal?    Monogamy isn't unnatural for humans. But even if it was...it is better for us. The repercussions of promiscuity can be heavy iindeed; but the results of monogamy are generally quite good, for adults as well as children. Natural or not, it's healthier.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	It may suggest it but not prove it. However some other primates are monogamous, can't remember which species. It might seem that because a male can theoretically have 1000's of children that we are naturally inclined towards polygamy! but the male body has other things like nipples that don't seem to have any function. I guess in some situations it would be useful to have lot's of children like if there was only one man in the population.|`|AA11589988	I don't believe that human beings can behave unnaturally so the answer from me is no. The brain control we have over our instincts is just as natural as an animal's uncontrolled behaviour because human brains are natural too!

Fair enough, go with the flow I say.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I think there are people who are naturally meant to be happily with one person at a time, and others naturally meant to be happily with more than one person at a time.    I don't at all believe there's any ONE "natural" way to have relationships. The only one thing I think is common to every human is the need for relationships of some kind. Whichever that is, is up to the individual.     The only unnatural relationships to me are ones without mutual consent. Like pedophiles, for example. They can claim all they want that it's natural for adults to want to be with children, I'm not buying it. They're evil, to me they're not human. They're the exception for me.     Anything beyond something like that to me is natural =o)|`|wKSvnna2aa	It seems humans are serial monogamists.|`|8ipxhmNTaa	I think polygamy is only 'natural' for one person - the alpha male.

Living an unmarried and childless life isn't very natural for them.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Monogamy may be unnatural but that doesn't mean it isn't something we should strive for.    Murder and theft are natural in the animal kingdom too but they can't support complex social systems as humans have created. Monogamy and family are more important on a social level than a biological one.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Bonobo primates are closer to humans than gorillas and their sexual patterns are the most similar to ours.  It is neither male or female dominated and without a harem to one male or one female.  Instead, the bonobo have multiple partners as well as bisexual activity.  They can create close bonds through sex but not necessarily long standing relationships (like a marriage) nor are they sexually exclusive.      Polygamy is not very beneficial to a society and not the most natural way to have sex or relationships.  Monogamy, however, isn't really the natural sexual pattern for humans either.  However, for our society serial monogamy seems to work.|`|RpHewn8gaa	I never understood the postmodernist obsession to make us "less" by paying more attention to our animal attributes than to what makes us human.

hl4kkvXhaa	Well, a social phobia is usually marked by extreme anxiousness or distress in social situations, such as parties or social functions.  So I wouldn't say that you have a social phobia.    You have something similar to what I have...a fear of intimacy.  Not sexual intimacy, but platonic closeness.  I don't have many close friends at all because I don't trust people.  If I think someone is getting too close, I tend to do strange things to make them go away.  It lost me my closest friendship because he did what you do, and after a while, we just couldn't keep battling it and broke off all communication.  I miss him, but...    I also get really judgmental with people and find fault in them, even though I know it's irrational.  It's like I have to hurt people before they hurt me.  My mentality is that a friend who hasn't had a chance to stab you in the back...and trust no one.      I'm working on mine by opening up and talking to people more.  I know that mine stems from a rotten childhood of neglect and abuse and feeling unloved.  So, it's been a pretty hard process because I tend to fall back into "bad" behaviors when stress or depression gets to me.      You need to try to figure out what triggered your closure because you can't help yourself unless you do.  When did it start?  It may be the hypothyroidism coupled with some sort of insecurity you are facing.  You may want to talk to your doctor about this and see if your thyroid condition could be causing it, and if so, what you can do.    Trusting is hard.  Especially in today's world because so many people do things that plant seeds of mistrust in our psyches and hurt us, whether they mean to or not.  But learning to trust people with the little things, and slowly working yourself up to the big things is the only way to beat it.      Sorry I can't be of more help...just wanted you to know that you're not alone, and that I hope you find your answers.
KF8CHY2faa	People (not just women) tell lies when they either fear the truth being found out, or is embarrassed by the truth. For example, a woman who's gained weight will lie about how much she weighs (or skew the truth) as a means of making her feel better about her personal being. She fears that she'll be judge more by the numbers on the scale that what she has to offer to society. The same as a man lying about his penis size. He feels that he'll be more 'manly' or more appealing to a woman (increase his chances of scoring) if he adds an inch or two onto his 'member'.     People who're uneducated will lie about the last level of education completed to look smart, and people who're broke will purchase things they can't afford in an attempt to make it look like they have money. Both men and women are guilty of telling little white lies to keep themselves from looking foolish and being the butt of social jokes. What these people who lie don't understand is that when you tell one lie, you have to follow it up with another lie, and you have to remember the last lie you told in order to create another lie to make the first lie believable.     Congratulations on your raise by the way ;) I hope I get a good one this year.|`|MfCkiJCVaa	For the same reason's men do. To make themselves look good.  For that matter why does anyone tell lies?

The only thing you can do is educate yourself enough to know when people are telling lies then resign yourself to the fact that their insecurity is what drives their falsities and you can feel sorry for them.

They've lied for so long they forget they are even being dishonest.    They have justified it in their mind - the ends justify the means.    Everyone lies sometimes, not just women.

f0YtxTi7aa	The part about walking with your ex and his friend and almost tripping was important because it signifies your feeling  that by being with both of them, (maybe your true feelings are for one over the other?) will cause you to "trip up" and make some type of mistake. Also the words of your ex in the 2nd part of this dream signifies that with him something is "up in the air" which means unsolved or unfinished. I cannot explain why the words in the dream became reality. Maybe it was God's way of preparing you for a decision?|`|bNNTzhVvaa	de ja vu. I think we have all had these moments.|`|gWYArJ0Haa	Ok, first of all, Deja Vu is an experience that you have never even processed before, somewhere you have never been and something you have never seen and you get that intense feeling that you have been there and done that.. so this is NOT deja Vu, Because you dreamed it.. this is more of a precognation.. meaning, you process something in your mind and in the future it comes true.. This is a freaky thing.. If you have never hung out with the guy before alone and he has never said these things that he said to you, then this is a precognition..     I have this happen to me and i make sure to know the difference between Precognition and Deja Vu..    My Precognition that happened recently, is i had a dream that my dog moved to my new home, 150 miles away from where she was and she came and lived with me and we lost her for awhile but found her....   I went to my parents three weeks later and they asked if i wanted to take her back with me.. i agreed.. less than a week after she was there, she somehow got out of the back door, and got lost.. we found her 5 hours later...    and i did not dream this because i knew she was coming back with me.. i had no clue of she coming back with me so i could not process the thoughts that she would be living with me because at the time, my parents didnt want her in my new city with me.. but randomly they asked if i wanted her with me.. three weeks after the dream..    this is a precognition.. creepy huh?|`|a5bpchuQaa	ya a Coincidence , it happens with every one|`|BeLGsfuEaa	creapy..but sometimes it happends

That dream logic where you know it has happened, without seeing it) and lying on the white carpet, naked and warm, she wrapped her arms around me from the back.    She pledged her love for me and said that we would be together forever and that she would never let me go, for i made her feel complete. Then she asked if I would like to be with her again.

A photo shows the same perspective as people actually see you.  Basically you left is on the right and your right is on the left.  Whereas with a mirror, everything is on the exact opposite side of where anyone else would see it.    For example, part you hair on one side.  Take a look in a mirror.  If you imagined you were looking at someone else rather than into a mirror, the part in their hair would be on the opposite side of their head, than yours.  But, if you were to take a picture (either digital or polaroid) you could see right away that the part in your hair shows up on the side you actually parted it on.    But, if you want to see (real-time) how people actually see you, you'd either need a video camera hooked up to a monitor, or two mirrors.  With the mirrors, you'd have to orient them so that you would look into one mirror and (in the second mirror) see the mirror image of yourself from the first mirror.|`|AA12172001	I would say that a photo is more accurate as it takes a snapshot in time with no wasted reflection.

They are just part of something big and having connections to that Joe guy.
7J6m0L3Haa	Because it's false. It also slanders the few men that have been violated by a few evil women. It implies that their suffering is false and their claims are fallacious.    It's a disgusting statement.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	A statement doesn't become 'offensive' just because it is 'untrue'/'false'.     The statement 'The Sun revolves around the Earth' is untrue, so is it offensive as well because it is untrue ?     Whether a statement is offensive or not depends on the intent of the person who states that, and the attitude/experiences of the listener. As simple as that.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Because the statement is an untrue one.  Boys and men can be subject to rape...by both men and women.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Because its not true.  Men can be raped by women and to say otherwise is to discredit and discount male victims.  The idea that men can't be raped causes men to be less likely to come forward and report what happened and less likely that women rapists will be held accountable for their behavior.  The emotional trauma of rape knows no gender and men can be just as harmed.    Both boys and men can be raped by women and we as a society should not ignore this.  Yes I find it offensive when someone makes such an untrue statement just as I find it offensive whenever their is an unfair double standard in society.|`|wKSvnna2aa	If you use your brain,    did you know that men rape other men, men rape boys, and women can rape men and boys as well?|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Because it's complete BS.     Kinda smacks of those who say women who are raped usually did something to make a man do it. BS.    I'm not a fan of it, no matter what the issue is, gender's not a factor for me =o)
uW4DD42qaa	Thjey should definately be punished if it is done intentionally. If it is an honest mistake, well thats another story.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	There already is. The penalty is usually that the woman is responsible for paying the money back to the man, and he could take it to civil court and sue her for further crimes. The state could also sue her if she lied knowingly on government forms. Furthermore, if the courts decide that you are responsible for a child that is not yours biologically, your problem is with the courts, not the woman. Appeal the decision to a higher court, obviously.    Of course I think it is not as serious as other kinds of crimes. It's non-violent, rare, and fantastic. All the evidence requires is a simple DNA test. It has none of the delicate nuances of other family law cases.|`|OXNiEDROaa	I think those women should have to pay the man backthe funds he pd to child support in error|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Well, when it's discovered (re child support) the women have to pay the money back. I think that's fair.    I'm not sure if it's a criminal offence but it could possibly be if they made a knowingly wrong statement to a government department or something. But how to prove if they're lying or just didn't bother to find out which guy it was?    I can't really think of any other form of legal recourse in this area. If you mean not related to child support, just telling the guy, I don't think lying to somebody or making a mistake should be illegal. You know, like adultery isn't illegal any more.    Harriet|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Yes.    A man should be able to get compensation for the emotional trauma his wife (etc.) has put him through.    Many feminists will come up with "but the poor children will go without if mommy whore has to repay daddy"    Fine - so let's wait until the child is 18/21 - and THEN the dirty whore can pay the money back, with interest.        Trust a feminist to claim it is 'rare' and 'fantastic'. Sexist lies.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	yes  Find the real dad and make him pay monthly payments to the guy. So his child support would go to that guy instead of the woman until its paid off.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I think if a woman knowingly decived a person to believe he was the father of her children there should be some legal resource. Right now I don't know if that's actually illegal but it really should be. Honesty should be encouraged.|`|ed252a7d69733fe4b4d70e0b519690c0aa	Absolutely, women always want equal rights, so a man is entitled to be protected under the law from some dip-**** woman who doesnt know who fathered  her child.
fkBZxZvCaa	I understand what you are saying.   I completely agree.      I know that bills must be paid, but to work oneself to death is not healthy.          My mother has worked outside the home for over 30 years.   She has high blood pressure and a heart condition...both caused by working in a stressful environment.         My husband has been a teacher at a very exclusive private school for 17 years.  His job is also extremely stressful.   He deals with conferences, demanding parents, and the workloads of colleagues who are too lazy to handle their own responsibilities.   He then comes home irritable and unbelievably tired.         Yes, it is necessary to work to pay expenses.  Some people are lucky enough to be deeply satisfied with their jobs.       But there are many people who literally kill themselves trying to meet deadlines, multi-task, and constantly do it all.   It is destructive.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	comes a time, when people  must compromise what it takes to earn a wage or survive in todays world, to aquire the things that are manditory of society in respects to needs(that is why civilization keeps defining Human Rights, third world etc.) Some folks have drives that keep up with the "Jones" type additude and others are just bent on survival in a monitary world, Ideals and perspective are the motivation for the type of toys us adults come up with in the long run, some have no drive to do so back to compromise, the straw that broke the camels back,the I can't take anymore, the Boxer gets knocked around and down in most fights but still comes back for more, If your parents didn't have that kind of motivation than your grandparents did, you will find that it is every other generation in alot of cases, especially in academic drive   I suspect adaptation is of the essence, some joker is allways finding away to defeat,a focus on personal demise and vexatious spirits will give one enough fuel to continue forwards in time.Must be the end of round five.|`|NwcQDWmNaa	that's a good question.  hopefully we'll find out during this recession, when everyone's losing their jobs and homes.|`|5lnwpiyAaa	The people that risk their health just to work every single day are dedicated. Not many people have this quality, so we should be grateful to thouse who are. I understand that sometimes they go a little over the top, but these people know what they are doing. They choose to go to work in spite of their health. Also, remember that if someone knows that they are dying, working may be the only thing that they can do before they die. They want to do the best they can in society before they die.   I wouldn't say that these people think that they are super-human. They just want to do what's best, and working is what they do.   You say that they won't be able to pay bills if they get sick on the job. Well, think about that. If they weren't working, home doing nothing, and get sick, how are they to pay for medical bills? Working. The only thing that gives you money is to work.     I do understand where you're coming from though.|`|NJU2XWu8aa	Because the corporate machine tells them to. I couldn't care less about work, but I pretend to when I'm there. The secret is to do enough to get by, but to save your energy for the things that really count - family and friends. Especially as most workplaces are hostile (working among enemies is bad for the psyche, just disengage is my advice.) I am never impressed by job titles or people who go on and on about what they do. What has it to do with the caring and communal nature of the human heart? NOTHING! Thta's why corporate fat cats need heart transplants, their old one is rotten from not being used.|`|r22lh8wRaa	I know it's a sad thing. My mother for example did this. My mother is 61 years old. She worked at a nursing home for about 5 years. This was physically and mentally draining. She put up with mean people who were seeking to get her in trouble and just for the sake of being ugly they did that. Then she had to lift really heavy people sometime. But what I came to find out about her was that she had an Emotional attachment to the job. Taking care of the elderly was something she did as a teenager and she loved to help them out and to be there for them. So for the whole time she was there she put up with all of that simply because she loved the ones whom she took care of. She no longer works there now ... they had to Fire her for her to realize maybe she didn't need to work there anymore.|`|YkseyT7zaa	That's why they call it a Rat Race.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	That's a great question, but what bugs me even more are the people who come in Sick to Work, infecting other people and then b**ch and moan when they are out sick, when they are the ones who got them sick in the first place!|`|r2iMJgIqaa	sometimes i HAVE to sacrifice my health because i have to work in order to pay bills. im hardly making enough money and i have to work hard to get it wether im sick or not!!!     theres a difference in working constantly though....sometime ppl need a break and they SHOULD take it.    sometimes i take sick days to rest myself physically and mentally and i think its important to try to do this|`|AA10023809	because not having work is even worse for health (mental and physical)

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I'm spiritual and believe in an afterlife, but I don't truly think the Grim physically came to Allen.  I have a Bachelor's in Psychology and know that dreams, although fascinating, can be really frightening. Dreams are an outlet for our subconscious.  We dream to allow our brains to process information that we are bombarded with every day.   I believe Allen's dream is a good example of his fear of dying or feeling out-of-control.  Not that these are good feelings, but most of us have these exact fears.  I would try and assure Allen that he's ok, and won't be seeing personally the Grim Reeper.  Maybe a little counseling will help him deal with these feelings and fears.|`|m89kGXBnaa	He could have dreampt he woke up, or woke in a hypnogogic state (still hallucinating from sleep). Either way, it means nothinhg, dreams are not predictivie, may tell us something about present worries but are also partly caused by random activation and memories from the day (i.e. films seen recently, not actual visitations of anthromorphic concepts)
60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	You have to be interested in the world....in most things, to become an interesting person.  Then you will have loads of things to talk about.    People who often complain they are bored, are usually boring people themselves.    Once you realise that the world and life in general is very very interesting, you will be closely attentive to the stream of info around you. And you will be eager to learn more.

But they are very hard to find.
M0jedNssaa	B/c people keep getting laid off and then they don't have a job for a while, so they don't have as much money to spend. And salaries are frozen so people don't get their annual raises. In my case, I depleted my savings in the four months it took me to find a job, only to find a job that pays half what I made before. But I accepted the job, b/c it's better than nothing. We are definitely not spending as much as before. My husband and I havent bought new clothes in a year, and we never eat out or go to movies or the bar. We just can't afford it right now.  But people who haven't suffered a job loss or pay-cut can probably spend as they did.  It probably depends on where you live...but where I am the unemployment rate is near 10% and rising.

Everything is on credit, which created the economic problem we have.    Eventually will have to significantly reduce the amount of credit use in america. Back to the way it was in the 70' and 80's. Trouble is it is a hard road to take and no one wants to admit that our entire nation has to change the we live our lives.

956663a3028055c8e593046e569fa61daa	It's very difficult for women to get those positions, and even when we do, we have to put up with a hell of a lot of crap.  Seeing the nonsense that powerful women go through discourages future generations from pursuing political goals.    Women often have to juggle campaigning and family life in a way that men don't have to deal with.  Sarah Palin got flak for leaving babies at home to campaign, while no one worries about the Obama children.  Working women already find it quite difficult to juggle what amounts to three jobs- work, housework, and childcare- but campaigns require a far greater commitment than is possible for mothers without supportive husbands.  If a woman isn't a mother, that's questioned- look at Condi Rice- but if she has kids, she's considered neglectful for not staying at home with them.    Then there's the crap they have to deal with on the road, from supporters and running mates as well as the opposition.  Sarah Palin, again, wasn't allowed to speak on her own or even dress herself.  Hillary Clinton has gone through more in the public eye than I can even imagine.  I was watching a repeat of Saturday Night Live from before the conventions, and her impersonator was talking about how we had to vote for Clinton or else she'd refuse to campaign for Obama and wreck his campaign as much as possible and do anything she could to make McCain win so that she could rerun in 2012.  Don't know if you noticed, but she did none of that and was in fact a great help to the Obamas.  SNL was just repeating a sexist meme that is really persistent: a woman can't just be ambitious, she's always crazy ballbuster who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.    With all the nonsense that political women go through, I'm kind of surprised there are so many.  Hooray for strong women!|`|qB3Kwh2xaa	because people are elected not based on their race gender or age but on their principles and character|`|bGsXsDhBaa	Because most men want to be in positions of power and all women are happier to be in the background cleaning and dusting and making things look nice ... and making sammiches|`|55mvjUPLaa	Because since the times of cavemen up until hundred or so years ago women's place was at home as a rule.

Because our pillockticians (is that spelt incorrectly, oh well never mind, eh?) are elected. The public look at the candidates and vote for the one who best represents their beliefs or needs.  I keep having this discussion with feminists, we live in a democracy - if you want more women MPs vote for the female candidate; if there's not one standing, run yourself!   Do you really think anyone already in the Houses of Parliament got there because someone rolled out the red carpet for them and plushed their cushions on the way through the door?   The point of equality is to have equal opportunity - if a woman wishes to forego this it's up to her but she shouldn't expect a horse drawn carriage ride there just because she's a woman.

OdoLSDlXaa	I agree with the others.  There are always activities.  For one, exercise.  There are at least 50 different exercises you can do in your home without exercise equipment: a variety of push-ups, crunches, squats, sometimes using a chair, sometimes a wall.    Brisk walking is one of the best exercises because it's low-impact and aerobic.  It is good for emotional health as well.  With a dollar or so you can take public transportation.  It's a bit of adventure at first learning the routs and the transfer system.  The library is free and has computers with internet access.  Volunteering is a good idea as well as looking for a job.

NuUFRa58aa	Without all the details, I am not sure how accurate my answer will be regarding this situation, but I will give it a shot.    Last year, I had an ex that was very obsessive and would not leave me alone. I chose to ignore it for awhile, but things ended up getting worse and I found out he was essentially stalking me. For this situation, I had to get a restraining order to stop the behavior.    Now, your friend's situation might not be as serious. If she chooses to confront him, she would probably get the best response if she approaches it in a calm way. If she approaches in a hostile way, the guy will become automatically defensive, not listen to her, and probably feel that she doesn't understand what he is thinking and feeling. However, if she approaches him in a calm, well-spoken way without reacting to his emotions, there is a greater chance that he will get the message. If this doesn't work, and ignoring doesn't work, it might be time to take it to the next level.     Hope this helps.|`|V2r0HRKjaa	Tell someone that can maybe get him to stop and then continue to ignore him!

You know your nice and friendly that's all you need to care and believe.
gWYArJ0Haa	Well your mind is in a subconsious state, so it is nothing that you can control.. It sucks.. but its true..    My roommate does sign language in her sleep with her hands.. its kinda freaky to watch!     But again, this is nothing you can control.     One thing i would suggest is thinking about more positive thoughts before you go to sleep.. If you process more positive thoughts before you go to sleep, you will have more positive dreams because the last thought process were pleasant. Dont go to bed mad!|`|wkK5JDz4aa	haha thats great!|`|THuRGnMGaa	One time my college roommate told me I kept saying sh** in my sleep.  I didn't even remembered what I dreamed about, but I do admit it was funny.  It was nothing I could control, I guess it was what I was really feeling.  I'm guessing if you want to stop cussing in your sleep then you will have not cuss when you are awake.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	common to talk in your sleep,yell out etc, problem is most sufferers do not remember on waking, something to help is not  to be over tired as this is a trigger for talking in sleep and sleepwalking. It is possible for people to talk back to you whilst you are asleep like a normal conversation and you will answer them back, in the morning you will not remember and deny it but they will so they can help tell you the situation you were in and why you said the things you did.

fDGPbwdsaa	You're limiting your social circle because you have a learned assumption that all men (in a relationship) will be bad guys.    Unlearn this silly notion.    And more importantly, learn how to deal with situations *IF* they arise.    For example, a good female friend of mine once asked me about doing things with her - she knew I was in a relationship and she too was in a relationship.    I took that opportunity to explain that I was happy as I was, and that I wouldn't want to tread on her man's (boyfriend) toes.    We're still good friends.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	You need to change..being friends with men, married or not IS healthy.  Dont let your past dictate your future.  I am friends with married men and there has to be respect and boundaries..or course your have your occassional dyckhead and in those cases you just stop talking to that person and ignore that person and the wife..but you have to keep yourself around good people that way, it wont be a problem..A man will go as far as a woman will take them..|`|dKoEFIqpaa	It's good policy.       There's no need to put yourself in the middle of another persons relationship.  It's bad for them, it's bad for you.    Marriages (or serious relationships) take precedence over friendships.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Well, as harsh as the situation sounds, it doesn't seem like that bad of an idea although I might alter it slightly.  There's no reason to drop off the face of the earth for a guy friend if he gets a girlfriend--this almost gives the impression that you only liked him as single because he was an option for you.  A better thing to do is just talk less often and hang out in groups.  Spending private time together might cause rise for accusations but if you're together in a group and not flirty then there shouldn't be a problem.    So you can hold to your morals and standards but do it without going to extremes.|`|mRnTvuOPaa	You should always be yourself and not change for other people. You do need to realize that most people won't accuse you of cheating just for being friends with a guy. All of my life I've had more guy friends than female (I'm female), sometimes the girls would get jealous. I hug my friends in front of their girl/boy friends, call them on the phone, hang out, and do whatever else I would with friends. Because that's what they are - their gender doesn't matter to me.  But that always happened in the relationships that didn't last, not the ones where they are still together. Trust is needed in a relationship and if these girls don't trust the men they shouldn't be with them. Blaming you is just an excuse because they don't trust their man or can't have a mature relationship. Do you ever miss talking to the guys when they get with someone? I know I would - I could never stop talking to a friend just because they are no longer single - I am friends with people I care about - I couldn't just stop caring because they found someone. Some people might see the fact that you stop talking as jealousy on your part. When I was dating my ex a mutual friend of both of us (who had a guy at the time) stopped talking to me and barely spoke to him anymore. I took it as her being jealous and wanting to get with him - I didn't see any other reason why she'd stop. Just remember that not all people are alike. You might even end up closer friends with one of the girlfriends / wives if you just give them a chance.  Edit: My ex always had female friends around, my friends would become friends with him. They hug in front of me and it never bothered me. One even does the cheek kiss, I saw her do it to him plenty of times and it was never an issue between any of us.

lpuD6qrxaa	Being a dwarf doesn't make you ugly.     Whoa, I never said I understood all of what you're going through, I mean, I'm a pretty tall teenage girl.    You're so much like me in how you think though. I do it myself, but we really shouldn't: divide the population into good-looking/ugly. It doesn't work like that.     Ever found a girl attractive, when your friends didn't? If my friends had the same taste in guys as me, that would mean I would never have a chance! (see, there I go again). Everyone looks different to everyone. Like in music, people have different tastes. There's no "you have bad taste in music", as my brother often tells me, there's just YOUR taste. And that goes for everyone on the planet, no matter what they look like.    I tend to get real mean when i see a "hot guy" dating an (in MY opinion) ugly girl. I think, well, she can get a guy, but not me? It's just my messed up brain that gets in my way, not my looks. but that girl probably looks hot to the guy she's dating, so everything works.  If everyone liked all the same things when it comes to appearances, then only the fashion models would be in relationships! And that would be so unfair.   No, the fact that people are attracted to different things make life fair.    Conclusion:     You cannot label someone as ugly or beautiful, as you did with your "you good-looking people", they're just ugly or beautiful to you. You just gotta get out there and find the right person (not that easy, of course I know. But life's a you know what, so you just gotta deal).    Peace,   New_Night    PS, don't get mad at this suggestion, but ever watched little people, big world? It just shows that you can be happy, which you probably know, even if you're different.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i am cute not a typical woman tall and sexy with blond hair   i am 5ft tall is all and have brown hair and eyes i like my eyes I think we all have days liek that is you are a little person or not . Someday i look at me and think wel you are cute and others yuck I am pregnant right now and feel i look fat with this basketball belly and being shortt is shows  more i have a cold so my eyes and nose are red and i cant get out cause i am snowed in with a toddler i am having a day too like you .   I am sure you are good looking you just dont know it , or are judging yourseld with them muscle men( i think they are sick looking)   hey us short gals need short men lol|`|nDQOwAA3aa	well i got a glass broke on my head and it left a badass looking little dip in my face it didn't scar up or anything and i actually think it made me look better so that sick bastard god made me look better with an imperfection i am sorry for your luck|`|c0XomxxEaa	Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to look absolutely amazing.. Im not too bad.. but i hate parts of me so much, sometimes I think my teeth are too wonky.. my hair isn't long enough.. my nose is not straight enough.. my body isnt how id like it to be.. but im sure other people dont notice these things.. I like my smile and mouth when I look in the mirror the most.|`|fazWgkePaa	First of all I think everyone has those days.   As for the 'good-looking' people who defines that? What makes someone 'good-looking'? Someone may say that they don't find blonde hair blue eyed people attractive, where as others may.  To answer your question though...I like my nose!!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	I think even the most physically attractive people in the world find fault within themselves, and those who don't are placing blinders of insecure arrogance over their eyes.    For me, when I look in the mirror, I see my eyes first because they are the one feature I've always liked.  Even the slight "imperfection" (a white spot on the colored part of my right eye) is o.k. with me because it makes me unique.  I always tell people I have a natural "twinkle" in my eye.  lol  Plus, I get told a lot that I have really intense and thoughtful eyes, and I like that people feel like I'm able to look into their soul.  lol    But, I also see things that bother me...I'm underweight and look sickly from an overly high metabolism and stress...my teeth are bad so I never smile anymore ever since my last guy friend said he didn't like kissing me because they looked like I don't take care of them (I do...but heredity, stress, and depression from traumatic events have taken their toll), and my hair is a frizzy and unmanageble mess but I don't have the money or time to have it fixed the way it needs to be.  Since I don't smile, I always look sad, and that bugs me too.    So...yeah.  I feel o.k. with me, but I know there are always things that need fixing...|`|VUqlQmJcaa	Truthfully when I look in the mirror, the thing I like the most isn't myself, it's the woman I plan to call my wife standing next to me that always captures my eye. I've never been a vain person and looks are incredibly overrated. Find the happiness within yourself eg: smart, funny, successful, whatever it may be and hold onto that.|`|PwgDhNyNaa	i feel like crap most of he time.

45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	I have this far succeeded in preventing some attempts to vexation by reacting with glowing silence and with distance, or by strategically mildly sort of unconflictingly responding when confronted with attempts of vexation.    There are people around us with obsessional poisonous thoughts and poisonous tongue or voice, people who want to impose their viewpoints and their power upon us, and who bitterly resent our presence and our imperviousity to their wishes.    There are people whom we may have to necessarily confront, who are as if looking for all possible gratis excuses for quarrelling with somebody. It is as if we must fight, we are compelled to fight, if they want to fight.    We will perhaps succeed in preventing vexation, and also in depressing our own just rage,    anyway it gives a biting pain within the vaults of our own chest to realize that such people in the nearby of us, and who are in a crisis of their own that we did not provoke, are much looking for conflict against us.    Maybe we should resolutely express our own reactive rage, and fiercely intrepidly fight against those who want to fight against us.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	Don't sweat the small stuff.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Many years ago I read a book called "7 Habits of highly effective people"  It teaches what our circle of influence is.  That is to say that we clearly understand what things in life we can control or influence and which things we dont and let the rest roll off our shoulder.  Aside from this I concocted a saying that works miracles in the work place...its called "Don'tnt Contribute and don't distribute"  This does not mean be anti-social but rather don't participate in gossip and dont distribute what you hear.  Remember everything you say comes out of your mouth like a boomerang and returns just as fast.  And finally if you have low self esteem with regard to your job then work your butt off to re-educate and chase your dream.    Good Luck|`|ogUJ6G0Caa	for me, i just try not to take things soo seriously u know? to prevent vexations in life is like trying to prevent from breathing. it just happens. theres always gonna be somebody or something that will annoy us at any given time. So if you have a "hey, i'll take whatever comes" attitude and not be soo serious, then i guess that helps somewhat; atleast it helps me sometimes. Other times.. well, you get the picture.
uW4DD42qaa	I'm sorry, but it sounds like this girl has no sense of humor. Do you really want to be with someone who can't even take a simple joke? any woman that would get that upset over something so silly is not worth dating.  Go out and find your self a real girl who knows how to lighten up and have fun|`|9VAnsWYUaa	I wouldn't say that your brother's actions were mature, but she definitely over-reacted and acted like a true 'uptighter'. You are doing her and yourself a favor by moving on. In fact you should thank your brother for bringing out her true colors. Hey life is short and if one has to be uptight about anything and everything they better go find some nerd who only speaks to her about the boring anthropology program he saw on National Geographic.    Good luck and enjoy !|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	If she dumped you over that the imagine what was coming later on. She did you a favour. move on|`|iRKOJhYeaa	Would you really want to be with someone who is as humourless as that? Who would take such great offense at such a thing?    Sounds to me like she had issues anyway, to end it over something so silly and so trivial.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	lol...sorry it is kinda funny.   She way way over reacted...but I could see why that would be embarrising as all get out.     Get your little brother to sit down a write her an apology, explaining what he did.  That it was a joke and that he is sorry....be best to include something along the lines of he wont do it any like this again.     Then you could try talking with her again.  Explain once again it was just a silly joke...but you understand why she is upset(important)   That you really think the two of you can move past this, maybe even laugh over it in a few years.    I'd try that, but if it doesnt work.  Move on and dont worry about it.  There are other fish in the sea.|`|OXNiEDROaa	wow...she must be quite young and immature.  I would've laughed my @ss off|`|pYimIJAWaa	Sounds like she was trying to figure out how to get out the relationship already, but was looking for an excuse.    Without besmirching your exe too much, sounds like she has a bit of growing up to do. At worst, she owed you a proper let down, and by not taking your calls etc. she's denying you even that. Plus, really fleeing to the bathroom in a flood of tears? She's just got some growing up to do.    Send her good thoughts (by 'ESP', NOT phone/text) and move on with your life. As you get older, your relationships will be more mature (hopefully), and you'll (hopefully) become better at communicating with the other person, and she with you. Things get easier after that, even break-ups.    Best wishes.|`|ebqQAzk1aa	It's not whether you were in on it or not, if she dumped you, it was gonna happen anyways, she just needed an excuse.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	The lil princess is troubel. Something else will set her off in the future. Just steer clear.|`|mde1I2Qoaa	Beat him up infront your ex-girlfriend.  Suggestions:  Stick a dildo up his ***.|`|jhNUuz0maa	She might have needed any excuse and that just put her over the edge.     What you should do, take your brother to her place and make him apologize or his actions. Then leave. At least show her that you weren't in on it that way, even if she doesn't want to talk to you, at least you can get her to forgive your brothers actions.     Or, you could do something to your brother for his actions and show your girl, this way she might see that you took care of the problem, and she might get a laugh out of it. Again, then leave. Let her come to you after wards. If she wants you back, let it up to her.|`|emOhSyY5aa	Sounds like that relationship was never meant to be. Don't worry about that, if you told her you were not in on it and she didn't believe you then that's her problem. Find another gf.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Given her attitude, I think she did YOU the favour.|`|Pl4jVVGYaa	people in relationships need to have a sense of humour.  This girl obviously didn't, so move on.
