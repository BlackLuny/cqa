35b1e9a45a5ecce24fed76b83d86cba0aa	i dont know the official rules, but for me, my boyfriend gets/ has gotten me:    flowers and a card for the major anniversaries... i.e. 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and so forth    bigger presents for the year anniversaries... i.e. tickets to a show or fancy dinners    and nice but inexpensive dinners and small gifts on the not so momentus anniversaries... i.e. 2 months, 4 months, 1 yr and 2 months... you get the point.    don't feel the need to celebrate every single month and every single week anniversary because in the long run they won't feel as special. my theory is that if you do celebrate every month, you're thinking of your relationship as lasting a month kind of thing. when you put it in terms of 6 month anniversaries (once you've passed that mark), then it feels more long term, more substantial =)    good luck!|`|AA11436340	i dont know sorry .. hope u get the best answer.

26b97ec8504c381bb92f0db0568bc0e3aa	You're not alone on this situation, sadly lots of people are too busy for their friends. I understand your situation. Lets say, you get what you want, you get transfer into top university, you won't stop being busy there, you'll get even busier to maintain in that university. If you think you being busy is just temporary, you're kidding yourself. When you graduate, you'll get a good job and be busy at your job. One day, you'll want to celebrate your life and realize you don't have any friends to celebrate with. Is that what you REALLY want in your life?  It's not that your friends don't understand you need to be busy right now, they are your friends, they want to hang out with you, they like you, cherish the time spend with you, tease you to make you come back to them, they want to hang on to your friendship. The ones that left are the ones that disappointed, or give up. You can't really blame them.   You're young, it's a good thing you know education is important, but don't let lessons of life and friendship pass you by. Just like knowledge, real friends are unmeasurable treasure.|`|fb9fd1750c993128bc2d9c203ef7d0e8aa	yes|`|7ea315d431a1759f36593b96220d041caa	don't feel that way they are obviously idiots thats you do not wish to spend your time with|`|d562233190ac48d1a2d453e8d8e8d61faa	All relationships must be cared for and nurtured. They all require work and maintenance. I understand that you are a busy lady right now, but that is no excuse for letting all your relationships slip through your fingers. You are old enough to know the difference between a good friendship and an acquaintance. The people that you are obviously just an acquaintance to have already left you, and the ones that have supported you and your decisions are the ones that you need to make time for. Don't get so caught up your studies or work that you can't share a laugh or two over lunch or dinner with a close deserving friend. Life is about being generous...be generous with your love and with your time. Those friends and loved ones that stick by you while you are concentrating so hard on school and work will be the same friends that help you celebrate the rewards when you graduate and move through the rest of your life. Take a moment and let them know you care.|`|dbed0f4bfea4d70a8459015b785ceff2aa	Lady, you do what you want to do!  If you chose not to see people, that is a choice that you make!  Choices are usually made relative to our interest.  No interest, then that does not get included with the chosen!    No person wants a spouse that does not have time for them!!  Otherwise, why should they be together?    And FRIENDS AWAYS look after friends.    There is an eternity of space between people that we know and the person that we call FRIEND!    And if you do not know and understand that, then you are nobodies friend!  Too, you have no friend nor an honest relationship with any person!

63647a2e157c12afc0e6596ef9cf518daa	La costumbre de entregar el anillo de compromiso surge entre los caballeros romanos, quienes aseguraban su contrato matrimonial con una pieza de hierro en forma de aro que la mujer conservaba hasta que fuera cumplida la promesa de matrimonio.     La tradicin de que dicha joya llevase un diamante se populariz a tal grado que se hicieron cortes y montaduras especiales para incrementar la blancura y el brillo de la piedra    De hecho se dice que el primer anillo de compromiso con un diamante y las caractersticas del que actualmente se entrega, fue el que en 1477 le regal el Archiduque Maximilliano de Austria a Mary de Burgundy    Los novios se entregan una alianza circular, como smbolo de amor eterno, representando en el aro lo que no tiene ni principio ni fin.     En el siglo IX, el papa Nicols, autoriz a considerar la entrega de anillos como la formalizacin de la relacin de novios. En la actualidad, la costumbre se ha mantenido y el ritual est incorporado en la boda catlica y en algunas otras. En las bodas civiles, tambin la pareja puede hacer uso de esta tradicin.    Los anillos pueden hacerse de diversos materiales, pero los ms usuales son el oro y el diamante. Cuando la pareja se compromete en matrimonio, el novio le entrega, usualmente, un solitario a la novia con un diamante, aunque puede usarse otra piedra.    En el momento de la ceremonia se intercambian anillos y a partir de ese momento, la novia comienza a usar su solitario junto a la alianza de matrimonio. La esposa usa sus anillos en el dedo anular izquierdo, colocando primero el aro matrimonial, basado en la creencia de que ese dedo comunica directamente con el corazn. Pero, momentos antes de iniciar la boda, la novia debe acordarse de que se debe pasar el solitario a la mano derecha, para que as el novio le pueda colocar el aro matrimonial con facilidad durante el ritual.    El novio le da el anillo a la novia para simbolizar su amor sin final, por su forma circular. Aunque hay de muchos materiales, los ms comunes estn hechos de oro y diamantes, lo que significa que el amor ser tan fuerte y puro como esos materiales. Se lleva en el dedo anular por la vieja creencia de que la vena de ese dedo llega hasta el corazn|`|03bc3f3d894e1a6ca5abdd7837a1fe4daa	de muchos ancestros pero es una tradicion muy linda ojala siga siempre|`|8b8953fe606ecc87081c34f272cdb387aa	no es una costumbre cirstiana por el contrario es arabe eso se dio en la invasion a los espa?oles|`|1d3ed1bf6e4d8cb36452226d5457c421aa	Del se?or de lo anillos.|`|mfhuNmBSaa	Antiguamente la peticin de mano era un acto imprescindible y era la ocasin en la que se discutan detalles como la dote, condiciones econmicas, etc. Hoy en da es un acto familiar que sirve para que las familias se conozcan un poco ms.    Se suele celebrar cuando la fecha de la boda est fijada. El momento ms apropiado es un par de meses antes.    Si esta es la primera vez que te casas, debers avisar primero a tus paps, ya sea en pareja o por separado, y una vez anunciada la noticia comenzar el proceso de la pedida de mano.     La etiqueta marca que deben ser los papas de l quienes llamen a tus padres para fijar la fecha de la pedida. Por lo regular estos eventos son por la noche ya que se acostumbra ofrecer una cena en honor a los futuros cnyuges. Tus padres debern establecer si desean que la pedida sea en su casa o en un restaurante. Sin embargo la tradicin marca que este festejo debe ser en casa de la novia y quien sea ella misma quien debe cocinar.     Es aconsejable que ese da, el novio envie un arreglo floral o un regalo a casa de la novia para celebrar la ocasin y aun cuando se trata de un evento familiar, todos debern vestir formalmente.     Despus de la primera hora y antes de comenzar a cenar, el padre de l (o alguno de sus hermanos si su mam es viuda) deber hacer formalmente la pedida de la mano d ela novia. Posteriormente, el padre de la novia (o su madre si es viuda o divorciada) debe contestar la pedida. Una vez que la mano est dada, el novio y dems familiares pueden tomar la palabra si as lo desean.     La tradicin marca que el novio debe entregar el anillo de compromiso en ese momento, el cual coloca en el dedo anular de la mano izquierda de su futura esposa. Sin embargo, hoy en da primero se acostumbra dar el anillo de una manera sorpresiva y despus se realiza la pedida.

A resposta: "Isso pouco lhe importa. O que o guia  na  escolha s?o as  provas por que haja de passar". Os Espritos superiores querem dizer com isto que, escolhida a  op??o, deve-se enfrentar as provas referentes a tal op??o. Se a  escolha for  o corpo masculino, dever enfrentar as experincias reservadas ao  homem; se  a encarna??o ocorrer no vaso feminino, as provas ser?o as reservadas  s  mulheres.Segundo o pensamento esprita, o homossexual  um esprito que  enfrenta momento de prova??o, e que deve estar vigilante para que saia  vitorioso, em vez de agravar os seus dbitos perante a lei divina. Mas o que  estar de acordo com a lei  divina? A resposta foi dada por Jesus: Fazer aos outros todo o bem que  gostaramos que nos fizessem. Certamente que isso se manifesta tambm em nossos relacionamentos afetivos, atravs de gestos de respeito e carinho por aqueles seres com quem nos relacionamos. Ent?o, o equilbrio sexual (que se manifesta por um comportamento que n?o  promscuo e nem desrespeitoso para com os sentimentos alheios)  caminho seguro tanto para homossexuais como para heterossexuais.Todos ns somos seres em busca do equilbrio espiritual. A maior parte de ns traz graves comprometimentos no que diz respeito no campo sexual. O Esprito Emmanuel, em sua obra "Vida e Sexo", psicografada por Chico Xavier, nos informa que, quase sempre, os que chegam no alm-tmulo, sexualmente desequilibrados, depois de longas perturba??es, renascem no mundo tolerando molstias insidiosas, ou em condi??o homossexual, amargando pesadas provas como conseqncia dos excessos que cometeram no passado.Depreende-se, portanto, que os homossexuais s?o Espritos que podem ter cometido abusos sexuais em sexo diferente do atual, respondendo, tal comportamento no passado, pela atual atra??o que sente por pessoas do mesmo sexo, devendo resistir a esses apelos instintivos em prol do seu aperfei?oamento moral.Ainda o Esprito Emmanuel, em O Consolador, nos mostra que Deus n?o extermina as paix?es dos homens, mas f-las evoluir, convertendo-as pela dor em sagrados patrim?nios da alma, competindo s criaturas dominar o cora??o, guiar os impulsos, orientar as tendncias, na evolu??o sublime dos seus sentimentos. Informa Emmanuel que observamos almas numerosas aprendendo, entre as angstias sexuais do mundo, a renncia e o sacrifcio, em marcha para as mais puras aquisi??es do amor divino.A recomenda??o do Espiritismo para o respeito e a compreens?o para com os irm?os que transitam em condi??es sexuais inversivas (homossexualismo), ocorre em fun??o do sentimento de fraternidade ou caridade que deve presidir o relacionamento humano, mas igualmente pelo fato de que nenhum de ns tem autoridade suficiente para condenar quem quer que seja, pois todos temos dificuldades morais e/ou materiais graves que precisam de educa??o. A esse respeito, Emmanuel finaliza o livro Vida e Sexo com a seguinte recomenda??o: "Diante de toda e qualquer desarmonia do mundo afetivo, seja com quem for e como for, colocai-vos, em pensamento, no lugar dos acusados, analisando as vossas tendncias mais ntimas e, aps verificardes se estais em condi??es de censurar algum, escutai no amago da conscincia, o apelo inolvidvel do Cristo:  Amai-vos uns aos outros como eu vos amei".O escritor e mdico psiquiatra Jorge Andra, no seu livro For?as Sexuais da Alma, considera que o homossexual, ao atender os sentidos em satisfa??o sexual, n?o estar em processo de realiza??o plena. Na homossexualidade, como em qualquer outro processo provacional, sofremos as conseqncias de nossos atos anteriores. Ent?o, se reencarnamos com uma distonia relacionada  rea sexual, isso nos deve ser encarado como sinalizador de que cometemos deslizes graves nessa rea e que necessitamos de ajustes, principalmente no setor moral. Segundo Jorge Andra, a falta de sintonia entre o ser e o querer ser, ou entre o que se  e o que se pensa ser, transforma o homossexual, masculino ou feminino, num ser frustrado (ainda que a negativa seja comum, num mecanismo psicolgico por demais conhecido), atormentado por ilus?es e anseios de consuma??o s vezes impossvel e que o debilitam moralmente, abrindo porta larga a graves obsess?es (obsess?o  a influencia??o negativa de um esprito desencarnado sobre uma pessoa).Para o homossexual, h necessidade intransfervel de vivncia equilibrada no campo sexual a fim de encontrar a harmonia para as futuras reencarna??es. Tanto o homossexual como o heterossexual devem buscar a sua reforma interior, n?o cedendo aos arrastamentos provocados pelos impulsos instintivos e sensuais. Ensinam-nos os espritos que a energia sexual  cria??o divina e que o sexo em bases de amor e carinho, respeito e aten??o pelo sentimento alheio,  for?a maravilhosa.O Esprito Andr Luiz, no seu livro Conduta Esprita, psicografado por Chico Xavier, recomenda "distinguir no sexo a sede de energias superiores que o Criador concede  criatura para equilibrar-lhe as atividades, sentindo-se no dever de resguard-la contra os desvios suscetveis de corromp-la".A Doutrina Esprita n?o condena o homossexual. Ao contrrio, recomenda que tenhamos para com ele todo o respeito, a considera??o e o carinho, uma vez que  um esprito que atravessa momento difcil (at mesmo tormentoso) em que necessita promover a sua edifica??o moral, atravs de uma conduta sexual equilibrada. O que n?o  lcito ao hetero, tambm n?o pode ser ao homossexual. Para ambos, os abusos, tais como as orgias, o sadomasoquismo, a necrofilia, a pedofilia e outros, s?o prticas que comprometem o equilbrio no manuseio das for?as gensicas e s?o contrrias s leis naturais, dando uso aos rg?os sexuais de maneira diversa do que recomenda a sua natureza.|`|652a97d76d2e05f3dca66e5808ed2638aa	claro que apoio, precoceito e racismo, qualquer tipo de descrimina??o s?o coisas repugnantes, todos somos seres vivos, amamos, odiamos, trabalahamos, queremos filhos, amar  um direito de todos.|`|4oqZeP3jaa	n?o tenho nada contra gay.porm o ato homosexual  nojento cara.|`|i9UdQzl5aa	Apoio, sem sombras de duvidas.

mjSpNDVLaa	Hey, you sound like me...I would highly suggest that you consider picking up school if that's possible.  I'd say that would be your best option, even if it's just a class at the local community college.    OR try getting a job in "real life" - that always gives you the potential of meeting girls.    OR yes, even MySpace, I've made some good friends on there.  Just don't be weird - you actually have to CARE.|`|f5379bb94403c466080ba5cd6eb7ad3caa	take a class at the community college you will meet people your age and maybe a girl.

You could even try those dating sites like match.com or something.  It's hard when you spend most of your time at home. Why don't you make arrangements to be able to go to say, a mall, store or some place public and chat up with someone who seems friendly. Maybe ask someone you already know if they know someone nice and have them introduce them to you. Hope this is helpful. Good luck.|`|5t0DG9zlaa	go and find one The End of ur Question
c1d8963c409a29d71168cc6a900a3aacaa	I think it means you should save up your pennies until you have enough money to buy a gun yourself...then you should play with it.  At least the idiot didn't shoot anyone else with it.  If you haven't figured out how a gun operates after about 35 yrs of life  ( 29yr friendship since first grage...about 6yrs old) then he probably had no business holding a gun much less owning one.  I am surprised it took him 4 days to Accidentally shoot himself.      Like I said, the blessing is that he didn't hurt anyone else with the gun and his ignorance.    Maybe instead of a 7 day waiting period with the Brady bill...they should have a 38 second I.Q. Test...to see if you are smart enough to know what happens when you stare down the business end of a gun.  Sorry to hear about your friend, but atleast nobody else got hurt, nobody innocent.|`|WYdgy0s9aa	first of all, i am so sorry to hear about yur bestfriend since first grade passing away. i believe the pennies were there all tha time, it's just tht yu are finding pennies now tht yu are paying attention to the surroundings, and yu were never able to find them bcauz yu had a great time wit yur best friend. remember tha good times yu had wit yur best friend and learn a lesson TO NEVER PLAY WIT A GUN and look on tha bright side, at least he didnt make some other random ppl get involved like the shooting at virginia tech and he would always be in yur heart tht says 'my longknown best friend who was always there for me and now lays in the ground for one of his stupid action due to an imperfection' (tht is why i hate the guns...)|`|AU25Fm4Zaa	This happens alot when people go to the other side.  I also last a friend last summer basically the same way. I also see LoveBirds now and I never did before.  Go out and get some books written by Sylvia Brown.

4ae1c1f5f96fc0ab69f592b03ff536d3aa	yes you will find someone great for you who is faithful.  A lot of guys stay faithful, prsonally i cant even find another girl attractive because i love my gf so much  You'll find someone, but be patient.  Don't be so anxious to be in a relationship, relax and the right person will come along.  If you get anxious you'll get into a relationship and soon after find yourself right back in this situation, upset and whatnot.  chill, let the right guy come along, and if he is that right one, he wont cheat.|`|gwpU448saa	stop getting together with the badasses, it's just that simple|`|0uafKRfpaa	It seems like its really hard to find a guy that can be completely faithful. Ive had a bf for a little less than a year and I really hope what happened to you doesnt happen to me bc it would like be the end of my world. So far he hasnt cheated on me and swears he could never do that to me. Its possible to find someone to be completely faithful and loves you.. i just dont know how long its possible for it to last :( and you dont need to be in a relationship to be happy I hope .. learn to be happy on your own.|`|py7qvJpaaa	probably not, most men are dogs. scientifically, there is something in there DNA that makes men cheat.|`|386cc375b66eae8654f00a1037231d48aa	Well, why do you need to be in a monogamous relationship to begin with?  Can't you just date around without having an exclusive boyfriend?  You can still have a close bond without having monogamy.  If you really hate being single and totally need a romantic relationship, then that means you're really dependent upon others.  You need to become more independent and learn to operate as an individual.  For example, I don't have serious relationships because I think they actually CAUSE more problems than they aim to solve!  I can solve my life's problems on my own without having some clingy, immature, selfish girl to tell me how to feel good about myself.  I've learned to be happy as an individual through my freedom and problem solving abilities.  It also helps to have just plain FRIENDS, without being romantically involved with them.  Or going onto sites like this to solve whatever problems you have in your life.  If your past boyfriends cheated on you, then that proves my point that ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THEY AIM TO SOLVE!|`|AA11317104	Maybe, maybe not but chances are you will.

Good luck and im sure you will find that right one again, keep your head up.
FBiKrZdDaa	no, it's not selfishness. it's fear and insecurity that makes you act that way.    if you are still in school, i believe you are still young - young and in love. it's understandable that you feel scared of the changes that will happen and their would be effects on your relationship.    but if you really love each other, you should let each other grow. i bet the decision is hard for him also but it might be for the best. you could still keep in touch and see each other even though you have different schools, right?    don't let your life revolve on your boyfriend. it's a tough battle in the real world out there. focus on improving yourself and make love an inspiration. study harder. grow in every aspect (emotionally, spiritually, socially, mentally, etc.) and become a better person so that when you and your boyfriend are both ready to enter a deeper commitment, it would be a blissful give-and-take.    remember this "absence does to a love what air does to a flame; it extinguishes the weak and feeds the strong." just pray. trust your love. trust love.    God bless!|`|90eb00952f700ad8a218032a6d75a466aa	Both are you are being selfish. Find someone closer to continue to be selfish with.|`|iyCQR68naa	Of course you are selfish...

There are a lot of fish in the sea but not a lot of blue whales...lol don't know what that means but take it for what it is.  Selfish, no.  You love him and it's always hard to lose something you love, but this too shale pass.

You need to take a risk, though, or you'll never find out, and that can bring years of regret and the 'what ifs'.  It turned out that my friend felt the same way about me, and I'm truly content in knowing that I took a shot of bravery.  and man girl!  you two have known eachother for so long?

FBiKrZdDaa	everyone needs a friend because friends multiply our joys and divide our sorrows. no happiness is complete unless you have someone to share it with. in addition, our burdens become easier when we have friends to lean on in times of troubles and difficulties. yes, friends are like treasures that must be valued.    but no matter how important friends are, they are not the "life of the human tree." what lies within us is the "life of the human tree". when there is love, faith and hope in our hearts, it will become easier for us to befriend the rest of the world. in other words, friends add color to our world but how we look at the world lies within us.|`|6b37126c4f3eb7f5fd695fe30c781375aa	Sounds like you are trying to share your views - what is the real question??|`|f5eb36cbdc50f7275867bcb67ec74424aa	ALL RIGHTY THAN!!
ewR5DSdTaa	Joke around with him a little (don't hurt his feelings!!), and ask him if he's shy around you because you're beautiful.  Just don't pressure him into anything and wait it out.  He'll get better eventually!|`|d604b52b6ad9d030b1d7edf4cb3f9734aa	Speaking as a former (in some elements still) "shyguy" of sorts, I can say that you need to be patient with him.  He did not become this way overnight, don't expect to change him that fast either.  A few suggestions, taken from my own experience:    1) If he doesn't have a job, convince him to get one.  ALL jobs involve some form of mandatory social interaction, which will be good for him.  2) Don't go Howard Stern on him!  Same for any people you both hang out with.  Shocking him into changing never works, it just drives him further into his "shell".  3) Don't panic! At the end of all things, if he is a good guy to you and treats you right, it's not the end of the world if he isn't quite a "social butterfly".\    Hope this helps.
SxcRIVcMaa	First of all, remain calm and don't try to ruin any friendships because you overreact. Next, just tell the guy straight up that you don't have those sort of "feelings" for him. If you lead him on it will only hurt more in the long run, but also say that you value your friendship and hope this won't effect it. Also, (i know this is hard, but it will help) just put your feelings out in the open about his friend. It's the only way this will get cleared up. If this guy does get mad at you for liking his friends then was he really your true friend to being with? Also, you can never be sure if the guy likes you. Guys can be confusing and shy so it's probably better if you ask him so you can get an answer. (hey, he might be really crushing on you =] *i hope so for your sake*)Anyways, i hope this was helpful. =] Good luck.|`|gfRHFEf8aa	OMG!! That is so weird- it is the same thing with me.  I just told the guy crushing on me that we can be friends but I would rather not go out.  Make sure you are very polite and don't  be nervous. Good luck doing this and I hope this was useful to you!

When we met, we really did have a lot of differences, but we opened each other's eyes to new things and now that we're married, it's hard to tell our interests apart.

Me, I like strong , self confident, independent women able to carry on an intelligent and hopefully witty conversation. How you feel about yourself and behave will be a greater factor in how men percieve you than any physical trait. Beyond that, If you act like a doormat , chances are you'll find a guy that will treat you like one , act like a woman of value  you'll be valued , act like a spoiled princess, die alone.

Please pray, talk to your pastor, talk to a friend, or whatever else may help.  Also, try to think about those who are in worse situations or shape than you, and pray for them.

Some things you should definately do are:  - call each other atleast twice a week  - text message!!!!!!!!  - if she has IM, be sure to IM her alot as well  - if the two of you have something that you do together regularly (movies every saturday, mall every tuesday, etc.), make sure that you maintain those events.  - meet her new friends from her new school; that way, you will all be able to hang out together, and you also may make a lot of new friends!  - let her know how much she means to you, and how you want to stay friends forever.

3f16947ca165d8a17198dbf1d359225eaa	She must be into you.. Spend a little more time with her, and take notice if she trys to make Physical Contact with you..  Touching, Tickling, that kind of thing. Even if you think it's by accident. It Probably isnt.  Notice if she Bites her lip and looks at you, or when she sits next to you, and crosses her legs that the crossed on is closest to you, or when you have a glass and she has one sitting in the same place, move yours closer to hers, and the next time she takes a drink see if she moves it Further away, or closer.. ( That on is a Instinct, she will move it further away if she doesnt feel comfortable being that close) When you walk by her, if she has her purse on the arm that you are walking by, or the one furthest away from you.  If its on the OTHER side of her, it means she has left her hand open for Possible contact from you.  Hope these little signs help. Just notice things like that, if she does alot of them, you should make a Move. Soon, before she thinks you arnt interested.  ~ bla_23|`|y1aqZFUEaa	ask her out and find out :P|`|cLyYKk0Laa	let me help you DO YOU WANNA GO OUT WITH ME there problem solved.|`|ci3rP9hOaa	First you need to be nice to her. talk to her, invite her for a drink or whatever. if she is nice to you back  So, Go ahead!!!!

Your family has to understand that you have to explore your life.  If they cant understand that, then they just going to have to.|`|FlHh9QeYaa	HI There, What a conundrum you are facing. If you do love the girl move with her but you really need to be sure that the break she is suggesting isn't an excuse for ... not wanting to be with you full stop. I suggest you ask your GF the true reason for her impending move. This will give ou the answer you need to make the decision. I don't want to fob your family off, but they will always be there no matter what!!! - They have no choice, so if things go west with the GF they will be waiting with open arms to help you hal. All I'm saying is ask your GF straight up 'What is the real reason for your decision to move'. If she says she doesn't want to be with you then take it like a man and leave quietly and go down to the gym and let thebgym equipment know that she is a (whatvere you are feeling).|`|zLgITtOAaa	You shouldn't leave her just because your family doesn't like her. Your family doesn't make your decisions in your life, YOU DO. Sometimes getting away from your family is a stepping stone in life that  you need. I wouldn't leave her just because your family doesn't like her. Take it from personal experience...My family doesn't really like my man either, but we have been living and been together for almost 4 years now...I love him to death even though I miss my family dearly. But my man supplies me with something that my family can't supply me with and that's unconditional love and support on a whole different level than my family could.  Is there any reason why your family doesn't like her? I say you talk to her and see if she wants to move with you...If she says no, then you both would have to suck up to having a long distance relationship...But if she says yes, this is a woman that would love you no matter where you go and what you do...She sounds like a keeper and I hope you make the wiser decision. Good Luck!~
Hoz66OtXaa	Look, ok it seems your starting to like him again i mean why would you ask something like this?  But anyway.   Id just go out with him unless your ex boyfriends dont talk to you anymore then i wouldnt risk it.  But your in high school you need to start to think LONG lasting love. I mean your almost an adult and you need to find the one to help you along your way.  When you find a guy ask your self.  Does this love feel sooo real that i could be with him for the rest of my life.  When i see him does my heart drop like 1,000 dricks  When i kiss him does my heart beat race to the love song in my head?  When he holds me in his arms does my skin heat up and tingle?  Does his love for me go allllll the freaking way?    If you said NO to any of that then most liekly he isnt the ONE for you.  GOOD LUCK and i hope this helped you.|`|akiMuf9xaa	First of all you should be happy that he's attracted to you. but if he is going to be stalker... then either ask him everything he THINKS he likes about you for example if he says i like you for your beautiful hair, then tell him something he doesnt want to hear to discust him...but make sure you are lying about it for example it naturally a big frizzball of hair if i dont straighten it and i dyed it. OR Find someone new that some how similar to you but much cuter. no fence.|`|l1cxmWGuaa	Let him down softly, don't be rude about it, and you definitely don't want to lose a friend like that.|`|AA11124905	Honesty is always the best policy. It may be hard but you have to be honest and tell him that you like him as a friend but that is about as far as it goes. Tell him that you are not interested in being his girlfriend but you do want to be his friend. After that the ball is in his court. While he may not take it well at first, eventually, he will come around and you will feel much better about yourself and the situation because you won't be burdened with keeping your frustations bottled up. Peace.|`|pT2wPhT1aa	Sounds like a stalker... You should just be straight up and say I like you as a friend but nothing more.|`|3e557b1e9a16aa5414cecf2655077cc2aa	you should give him a serious talk. tell him that its better if you guys are just friends and its hard to think of him as more than a friend|`|ca23e4306559587fb5aa716c19ae19b9aa	maybe just tell him to  chill out a little bit..in a  nice way of course..just  be like it kinda bothers  me that you always talk  about us being together.  it`s not that i don`t like   you at all. cause i do like  you as a friend and i want  to be your friend. but it just  makes me feel uncomfortable  when you say things like that    say something like that...  but make sure you tell him   you`re not interested..but try  to let him down easily ...|`|af05e79a32105d192831efe2e95bc13daa	Tell him the truth.  Let him know you want to remain friends and not get into a serious relationship.|`|yjvf0heGaa	First, try reconsidering the friend thing. He may like you but that doesn't mean you should give up a good friendship.    Second, you could either answer his question and say that you're OKAY friends or you could explain to him firmly but gently that you would rather stay friend and that you wouldn't want to ruin your friendship. Also make sure you tell him you feel akward discussing the possibilities of you becoming a couple and that you'd like him to stop.|`|GmbAVynNaa	slap him around and call him susan.... or if that don't work tell him ur a lesbian

Wp9kXlEEaa	if ur truely "in love" u would do anything for that person   if u could get married to them right now u would  ud die to make them happy.........  and in the end u can only be in love with one person......    just love on the other hand is more generic  u can truely love 1000 people without any problems  its just that you care for that person you love, and u would b hurt if something happened to them and you care about what they do and what happens to them  kind of like your parents or a brother or sister or something    on the other hand, it sounds like your friends being stupid about this situation  whenever somebody says there in love, theres always somebody right behind them telling them they don't know what love is............mayb b/c they've had too many boyfriends/girlfriends, mayb b/c they havent been dating this person for that long  those people are usually just bitter about some relationship they had where they said they were in love, or people who have been in a relationship for a while and believe their the only two freaking people in the world capable of "true love"    just ignore her comments about your love, its not something other people can dictate, love is different for every person. thats why it feels like you and you boyfriend/girlfriend have the truest love in the whole world, b/c love between no two couples is the same(thats what i believe anyway)    just take it as it comes, if your in love you will know, and when you realize that it doesnt matter what anybody else says, cause they dont know your love|`|hGN8vr8Oaa	it means she cares about you and wants you to know your friendship is still so much more important to her then whatever feelings you may have for this guy. youll know when your in love no one else will. but she obviously cares about you enough to tell you...hey wait? what about me. im still here....if this makes any sense. let her know you still care about her and need her support to make it in the relationship with this guy.|`|a6ce596155aa57dea3dda35221bc57c3aa	It means he doesn't make you have butterflies in your stomach, or make your heart palpitate, or make you cream your panties....but you would never do anything to hurt him because you care for him.|`|YhDmE8Ydaa	she doesnt like him more than a freind|`|9383e70567b68ba0d653a8c20e978c59aa	that means u love him as a person but u don't want to spent the rest of your life being wife to this person|`|HQjnzmbiaa	Yes.

A New Car is always a teenagers dream., Maybe a vaction for summer, something that he will remember ya know.|`|tgB7H8K4aa	A name plate with his name on it or maybe a nice watch to help him keep track of the time for he won't be late picking you up for a date.|`|2b2c069aa3aa623be731b067d426b425aa	new pen or cell phone..|`|JSuBD4u9aa	xbox 360|`|ATGMiuNlaa	Is he a friend?

AA10803826	sit him down and tell him straight-forward what you just told us...|`|etFNtGJ7aa	Guys do not need females, they need wheels, housing, a few cloths and a job. If you can guaranty anything about the future then do so because no guy in his right mind is going to offer assurances in a world where everything is subject to change. You want a rose garden? Build it your self.
L3z7IIISaa	ask him there is no way you can read them like a book, now im not saying that they are complex but its really hard to tell because at that age they hide their feelings a lot. maybe just hint something to get that kind of conversation going.   ?
IwEpMFCaaa	It must be hell living two lives! You're exhausted and you want to give him an ultimatum? For what? This man has no life, and has no intention of getting one anytime soon. What you should give him is a one-way ticket to the other side of the planet so that you can move on and live your own life.     Relationships consist of TWO people, totally engaged and participating in the process. When one is carrying all of the weight it leads to emotional stress and physical exhaustion and resentment for the person who lacks self respect and concern for their own condition.     Don't sell yourself short. You deserve the very best. Why waste your time trying to force someone who doesn't even love themselves enough to work and take ordinary care of their body to love you.     The world does a great job sucking the life out of you on its own. You don't need his help. Move on!|`|l7YzvxaLaa	It's time to ditch the guy. Life is too short to bog yourself down with dead weight.|`|VpzUXE1Maa	I dont know|`|954c448d4f577e69c05ec77c58ca391caa	yes- let him know u mean business! contribute or get the boot! :)|`|W2BA2zyqaa	Love is all about breaking up and making up again, isn't it?

oHcF2u28aa	Go online to your states child support enforcement site and look up reviews and modifications.  In most states orders are reviewed--looked at--every 2 1/2 to 3 years for changes.|`|gVMHmRPdaa	been there with divorce and child support...so i do know that whenever i want an increase i have to go into the courthouse and put in for a petition for cost of living increase. then they set a date to see the judge and the judge makes that decision. as well as if you want your pymts decreased, you have to put in a petition. I also learned that being that a divorce is a contract and you can't break it nor the agreement on child support in it...if you lose your job you go in and explain your situation and you'll pay a court ordered lesser payment but, you still will owe the balance so meaning you will owe arrears and if you do taxes they'll snacth it from there at the end of the year.
QAyiU6Qbaa	wrestle without clothes on|`|fb980253971f873d3c314b602330b5dbaa	Maybe squeezing each other, on the waist, arms, or on the hands.

y5lVxdIuaa	there are many reasons for the problem. Girl , give him a bl*wjob, different positions, toys, have him suck on your t*ts, talk dirty to each other, tell him to go as wild as he can, because he might be afraid to let his everything out on you, you need to spice up your sex session because in the beginning its new, its fresh but it will get boring if you guys do the same sh*t everytime. SPICE IT UP!! get on top of him! you need not to be afraid because if you are not ready to spice it up then stop having sex with him.|`|moeAoBxeaa	Use your warm moist mouth to keep him hard baby!|`|vpS0WGRjaa	Try new methods.

Tease him before sex, make him desire you.|`|aSnu96Uhaa	You should worry a little about what he really wants ,specially if you are willing to keep him hard,so he is the one with the problem he needs to find other ways of keeping you satisfied if he can't stay hard he needs to make it interesting to give you time to finish.|`|AA12304162	How often do you do it? trying laying off for 3 or 4 days..the more often you have sex the longer it'll take for him to recuperate in between.|`|jh5JLRqMaa	As far as not lasting he is either being selfish or has a problem.

e28edc4cfd9ef67507ee0f61fcd5120daa	Tell them you are married. You should provide more details to your question though.

Just tell them your married, and back away from them
TpedyP6caa	Walk up to him and talk to him instead of waiting for him.|`|R64ZVi6Eaa	leave him alone your not seen with him...he only talks to u behinds doors,not good move on.|`|sDSftIEgaa	Many young guys like to flirt with girls. My thinking is that if he will only talk to you on the phone or online, but he openly flirts with other girls in public, maybe the feeling is not as mutual as you think. To me, this sounds like a guy who might be playing you. Especially since he seems to be keeping your "relationship" a secret and doesn't talk to you in front of the other girls he flirts with. My advice, find a guy who is not afraid to show you off..
69KuggLvaa	Times have changed...... But I don't keep a man up...... It's a dog eat dog world and you have to fend for yourself...|`|AA12102890	not sure what that means
XJq2fUkyaa	NO it's not unnatural, it's perfectly natural.  The only thing that could make it unnatural is the way you deal with it.  If you're not getting any then your body craves it.  I'll bet that if you were to get into an intimate relationship that your sex drive would calm down.
JpIrk2S2aa	She probably wants to spend a lot of time with her friend and her friend is probably a ***** and her friend and herself were probably like that together so for lack of wanting to be a sell-out she is faking her b!tchiness in front of her friend. confront her about it.|`|59e51992041c17d021d8c0d37bd9706eaa	shes worried about wat her best friend thinks. she wants her friend 2 think she cant b changes by a bf or sumtim, like she wants 2 show her friend shes n control, idk if that makes sense but thats probably whats happening. talk 2 her about it but if she keeps doin it just move on, u probably deserve better anyways|`|yXVAGuvkaa	shes just upset... shell get over it dont worry,,,, just talk to her

WWNUkdlIaa	Una pregunta muy interesante.Dependiendo el contexto social e histrico es como yo respondera. Actualmente la soltera es muy diferente a la de las abuel@s, creo que la mayora ya no la ve como una desgracia, es un a posibilidad entre varias de seguir con un proyecto de vida. Lo que si creo es que todava hay crisis de qu hacer con la independencia econmica, con el nivel profesional, los logros en la apariencia para gente madura (avances en la esttica para mujeres y hombres, como tratamientos cosmticos, entre otros). Me parece que tanto hombres y mujeres estn redefiniendo qu es formar una pareja, con hijos o no, casados o no, viviendo juntos o cada quin es su casa, etc.  Los hombres tal vez no tienen muy claro el nuevo rol ante una mujer trabajadora, exitosa econmicamente, etc. Y las mujeres se confunden con lo de buscar al caballero en corcel blanco, en compartir gastos, en manejar su libertad, en seguir siendo abnegadas pero preparadas. Creo que es toda una revolucin, pero que no va mal, todo se est reacomodando. Para mi que ya no existe solterones o solteronas, a menos que mujer u hombre se sientan devaluados, sin independencia, viviendo a partir de la vida de sus padres, cuidado de ellos hasta que mueran,o cuando no se tiene vida propia.|`|cW8nWmQjaa	En mi caso,yo estoy divorciada,as que la experiencia bien ,no te lo puedo contar,pero no me he vuelto a casar .

How does he flirt with you, beacuse there differnt types of flirting.  Maybe he's shy around you beacuse "You're that girl"  You owe it to your self to know if he likes you or not.    Trust me. I'm in the extact same position.  only it ended up for me..I was wrong    so good luck!|`|15YkiBFaaa	One thing that a lot of people get confused is when they don't ask straight out if a person likes them or not. Just ask him and if he said no, then move on. There are plenty of other people out there. Your guy friend might really like you but is probably shy to ask you out and might be making up about the whole liking another girl thing...but you'll only know for sure if you ask him. It's hard asking straight out but you gotta go for it.

But I wouldn't date a guy for 7 months and let him pay for me without an actual relationship.   also, i would do nice things like make dinner and buy presents for. that's how i make up for the fact that i dont pay and show that i care.

FDV4WPIDaa	You are correct you will never ever meet someone like your wife again, but with the help of God you may meet someone better and i mean better only because she will not leave you this woman will feel the same way you do about your relationship and would not want to ever let it go for nothing. So when you say you will never meet someone the same if you think about it why would you want to be hurt all over again. This time focus on better. God will bless you with better.|`|AA10591236	Too much missing information. Why did she leave her family in the first place? Why didn't you go to Germany with her? I don't think, from what you say, she was all that great. Perfect morals wouldn't have dumped you like that. Or, the pedestal you had her on was too high. Lower you expectations, find a real woman, and get on with your life.|`|FN3zsDj9aa	I was with a man for 9 years who was perfect for me in every way, except for that thing with my kids. He never wanted any. I had three.  He still held my hand ever where we went, still cuddled with me on the couch at night. right up till the day "out of no where " he said " I can't handle the kids any more" He left me and I was lost. I never knew any one who had the friendship he and I had. My Mom said we reminded her of her grand parents whom she remembered to be madly in love till they died in there 90's  It took me 5 years to even date again. in the 8th year I met the man I am married to.   I never would have believed that I could find this twice in one lifetime when most people never find it once. They say that we are all attracted to a certain "type" and that's why women who get abused will always end up with abusive men etc etc...

Good luck on your search, take it easy and it will happen for you.|`|o2XqUG5Yaa	for every girl you're dating/married to, there is definitely someone better out there... sometimes, it's just a matter of being satisfied with the one you're with...     unfortunately, you no longer have that choice... once one partner gives up in a relationship, it's hard to try and fix it... it's not impossible, but it's hard...     first thing to do, is really figure out why she's leaving you... fix the problem, so you don't make the same mistake in the future... keep in touch with her, be her friend... who knows, one day, it may work out again...but also, don't get your hopes up... just learn to adjust...     believe me, finding another girl is the least of your problem... your biggest problem is learning to live without her... time heals everything... you'll be fine..    p.s. character flaws are subjective... everyone sees things differently... learn to be open minded and see things objectively...     people don't have character flaws... they simply have different personalities...|`|AA11872348	If she was so great,she would never have left you. If she has such great morals then she would never have married you and then want a divorce either. You can find someone ALLOT better. As far as I'm concerned what she did to you is a bunch of crap.|`|03e3e97803de72c30b2272091cb8cc11aa	Well, I know its a bummer right now and you probably want to drink beer.    I don't think she was good because she left without even trying to work things out.  What kind of crap is that?    Go out get happy, concentrate on your career, keep with your friends or make new ones, buy some new clothes and watch what happens a year or two or three years from now.  She will probably want you back and then you'll have to make a choice between the girl that treats you right and the girl that had no vision to try and work things through.  Beauty fades, and life is a struggle to stay alive; you need a partener that will stick it out even when the crap gets thick so you can look back and say.......damn WE made it through all that baby, here is your wedding anniversary present its another diamond ring.      Screw that dogmeat broad and get a brand new girlfriend
wKG39U0aaa	I wouldn't know, and I don't think I can help much here.. but my advice?     Don't lose your job over a fantasy like this|`|AA11682169	Hey Michael, I'm not sure you may be able to spank your employee but if you are in a relationship with a lady you can certainly talk to her about role playing and have some fun.  My hubby and I role play all the time. One of his favorites is when I put on my tiny little plaid skirt, 5" bright red stilettos and a tight blouse. I put my hair on long pony tails and then go to the principal's office because I have been "naughty"!  I put up a fight but I do end up over his knee and feel his hand spanking my bare a.. ! It always leads to great sex!  Find the right lady and you can try this scenario with her.  Just make sure you give her the things she wants too!  Good luck!|`|q334x7dHaa	I'm sure you could find women who'd roleplay this with you - but don't look for them at work.  You can still try it and just pretend the person is your secretary.|`|fCF7tZ4qaa	you would be surprised at how many women are into this... Just do it and I'm sure she'll love it...|`|161e109fc65e4b3a56397fdfc8297effaa	i'm so into it, but would never ask for it. i would just always be secretly hoping.  But i dont know if other girls would feel the same.|`|pA2jRPLKaa	Maybe not most women, but possibly the majority.  But that still leaves an awful lot of girls who would absolutely love it.  Good luck in finding them!|`|ce73471273f03d197466356fe8a32abbaa	I LOVED that movie.
ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	His behaviour is typical for a guy that is 16. He likes the challenge, and so he chases you. If you are not interested in him keep avoiding him, he will sooner or later get the hint. Trust me, he has no serious intentions, just likes the game of the chase.|`|ed5269fe07c3cf54be9273e05df681f7aa	I would stay away from this guy.  He probably likes you physically but he's probably not mature enough to handle a real relationship.  Also he seems like he'd be too possessive and might be abusive(even if it's just mentally)|`|AA10240460	He doesn't sound ready for a relationship. Don't expect more than he can give. Obviously he's not much.|`|2f5133b4b3f8053e316f8a85fa3fe8e7aa	Hello !  Reading the first and second paragraphs, i think that he really loves you and wants to go out with you ! even to get married with u.  But for the additional detail, I don't know really what to say!    If you want to be with him, don't ask anyone, you only can understand what he wants !     My concern, if u go out with him, don't go to sex directly ! wait until you are mature ! Just that !!!|`|dCSpdPkkaa	AH the good ole days of taunting and torturing those you love. His behavior is not shocking for a 16yrs old boy, my guess would be he likes you but have trouble passing on the message. If you're ready for a relationship now then you should tell him. You're young so there really no reason not to try, if anything you'll at least gain experience. Good luck.

And then, if he doesn't, ask him out. If you ask him out, he'll know you like him (duh!). And if he says yes, you'll know he likes you!
hsTr4JDcaa	Actually this happened to me also. At first my bf was being a chicken to not admit that he liked me. But of course time passes by and he started getting confidence and asked me out. And of course I said yes.   I think you shouldn't rush. Your friend's crush will come to your friend when he feels ready to ask your friend out.

F4l4FLMRaa	Depends on what you are asking her to.   If it's to a movie.   Just say something like this:   Oh, I got these tickets to see (insert name here)  I was wondering if you wanted to go?    Or what are you doing on (insert day here) oh because I was wondering if you would like to go to (insert place here) with me.|`|Eio1vfzWaa	What you want to do is "slowly" push that question to her. For example: start out with questions like "what do you think about relationship", "What do you like in guy" and then go into "what do you think about me" or "how do you feel about me". Keep in mind that it all depends on what she says, pick your question wisely.  Using these questions will let you know if she likes you or not, even without you showing your true feelings for her...in this case it'll be a lot easier for you to tell her that you like her.|`|16b4e7ae12a183ace6ff31a22f1bb94daa	well Im kinda in the same situation but with a guy so I would want him to ask me to hang out like at the park or some thing or where ever you come up with that and if you like her ask her if she'd like to go out for real or whatever.

65mhNkPjaa	First of all- thank you for your sacrifice for our country. Second, I think you need to have a heart to heart talk with her and tell her everything you just said above. Just tell her that you need her support and you wish you could be with her. Also, when she gives you a hard time about not doing things that should "come naturally" just tell her that you are willing to do whatever makes her happy but you need her to tell you what she needs. I hope this helps.|`|y2xp1S5Paa	Shes a girl and so ever girl says it should come to you naturally lol...sounds to me that she wants to just feel loved and you can do this even though you are far away..think of different ways to express your love to her ..send her flowers I understand u might not be able to where ur at but ask someone u know to do it and u send the money ect..write her love letters,,poems..ect..keep in mind this its going to be alot easier for u over there to not be lonely then her over here due to the fact that ur around a bunch of guys who know what ur feeling and don't have anyone either..as for her shes around friends and family im sure who have the one they love and she sees this and misses it more..good luck!|`|9a734c12c8a5bcbcb7f973ccdc4ed0eaaa	it seems like she is being a bit selfish, and she might be blaming you, i know that doesn't make sense but she's a woman it doesn't have to make sense for her to believe it|`|h2N6FrY0aa	I wish I could know how old you guys are... but anyway I guess you should both be mature enough to face reality as it comes and try to make it work. Of course you miss each other... of course you get sad some times (and there's nothing wrong with saying that you are every once in a while), but the bottom line is that this is the test life is giving right now and you both need to hang in there and pass it. As an outside observer I can honestly say that I understand what you and her are each going through, but the truth is that you are sacrificing much more than her and she should be aware of that and supportive, more than anybody else... If she's your fiancee right now and can't deal with this situation... I really don't want to imagine how it will be when she becomes a wife dealing with raising children on her own while her husband is on duty. I'm really not the right person to tell you what to do but I have an idea. Try writing her a letter telling her exactly how you feel about her and how she is making you feel right now with all her wining. Tell her all the things you had just included in this question... even the part about your thoughts of letting her go!  I would definitely try this and then wait to see the outcomes in her attitude. If there's still not a more supportive mood in her after a period of time I would then make a drastic and definitive decision.

jW6kLHiWaa	Well, I've never thought any girl was the right girl, since I AM a girl, but I think you'd have to like the girl for more than her body, or her body has little to do with it. You could call that girl your best friend without hesitation, and just the sound of her name makes you feel like your heart is about to burst. Your relationship isn't sexual in any way, because both of you like each other enough to wait until you are married, which you can see in the future with this girl. Yes, you look at other girls, but you don't want them because you believe that you've found the one for you. You can be completely honest with this girl, being able to tell her anything. You would do anything for her, and don't even care if your buddies said you were "whipped," because maybe they're right, and you're completely fine with that. And the last thing, you can look that girl and say "I love you," with no regrets. Hope this helps.  *Nat*|`|FhIJqQmYaa	by the why every time you are away from her and you cant wait to see every time shes not there|`|NlTdhG0waa	follow ur heart...if she gives you that tingly feeling all over and you feel like you would do anything for her then thats when u no its tru love|`|th3mvKS5aa	GO TO HELL! HEHE :)
b58641a94f82aeec8fef029e259ba6f8aa	I think your level of self worth is not right and if you don't get a grip you will lose, just not to someone else but to the very person who you want her to be with.|`|9IjciQpjaa	i hope u realize that things will get worse if you keep this paranoa up when actually get married.........i dont really think its a trust issue completely...but eventually your going to have trust and believe that she'd never do what you imagine she would.....try thinking of her as yourself...you'd never cheat on her and she trusts and believes that you wouldn't....so do the same for her........................................ try electroshock therapy|`|XJq2fUkyaa	the best thing is to tellher how you feel, apologize about being overprotective nad insecure, and then back off, tell her to tell you when you are going overboard, listen to her, and back off, if you realy trust her as much as you said then it shouldn't be a problem for you to back off and give her some breathing room.|`|Rxsx6Mq3aa	your either over commited or shes under commited or both, relax, stop being protective of her and if she gets away from you she never was ment for you in the first place, and take any hints along the way that she might be tooling you and drop it if it starts coming to that. Don't get angry, simply become complacant about your relationship if its going downhill and start seeking out those girls who treat you the right way.
bU3pmi3Taa	yes she is a biter. she is in denial about tht tho. nothing is wrong with copying tho (unless its on a test), they say copying is the most sincere form of flattery. tell her that she copies too and she shouldn't complain about B, cause she has the same thing going on..even if she wasn't a biter she shouldn't put down on B anyways.    basically confront M again, super serious  honest girl talk kinda thing|`|XJq2fUkyaa	WHAT????? What in the hell is the question? Who Cares? If she is doing stuff you don't like, ignor her and don't be her friend, if you still want to be friends ignore her actions and keep being friends.
y6DieDquaa	Do something or forget about him . Is it right to ruin your life only dreaming what could happen?|`|a59579ec8aee8902f555d4fccd5299e6aa	Start flirting in his direction, and get more and more obvious until he gets the message.  Us all your feminine charms to get noticed, and hit him over the head if he fails to see you.|`|42btYlH3aa	u should ask him if uve liked him 4 5 years
17xgo3F7aa	I have a twin bro, and when he has friends over, its not exactly the lay on the floor in a circle on your stomach and kick your feet over you and say "oh my god! shelby is like, so totally hot!", they do talk somewhat about them. But boys don't like to sit down and talk about things, so most of the time its when they are sitting on the couch, watching hockey, and during the commercial they might mention a girl, but only occasionally. They don't get into deep conversations about it.|`|KWtBnNoDaa	Well in a way yes, but it depends what kinda guys if they are the really popular, cool ones then they just talk about how hot girls are, but if its the less popular ones, they will talk about how nice girls are...|`|63qp7yVfaa	yes guys do talk about girls they talk about sex|`|0xPNHVrNaa	when you find out tell me! i wanna know just as badly as you!
u2gc3nqRaa	Get involved with activities, the boyfriend may just happen naturally while your doing stuff.|`|AA11649471	FIrst year in high school should be for you to get used to everything new.  Dont worry about if you should get a boyfriend, you have the rest of your life for that, but only have one shot as a freshman in high school. Just take one day at a time and let whatever happens happen.  Good luck.|`|eKZCMSiXaa	It would be great to get involved with sports or activities early on in your high school career so you don't feel new to it later, but for the whole bf thing, each year at my school, freshmen girls end up dating junior guys within like...the first month or so of school (it's like a curse). I say don't try to get involved with guys, but if something happens, don't be afraid to meet someone.|`|mwewiODzaa	It doesn't really matter if you should get one. Enjoy your freshman year, have fun, flirt with boys, etc. You shouldn't be looking for a boyfriend, just take your time, you will find someone.|`|uuoWMasuaa	Concentrate on making good grades and forget about boys for right now...You won't regret it.|`|bfa74c56eabd2a5e33cf5cf5cd719d62aa	Dont get a boyfriend just because you want one. Get a boyfriend because you want him. If you find someone, take them up! If not, dont go looking. Love happens naturally. Its not forced.|`|LSggmlQiaa	Sounds like just because your entering high school you think you should have a boyfriend.That is understandable but it alone is no reason to just go out and find someone.You should be with someone you like and because you want to be.Don't give in to peer pressure|`|AA11838795	stick with your schooling.   boys suck.|`|4591756175e2e6d388427a1ebebecb51aa	oh hell no.  you are too young.  dont get into that ****.  everyone will be doing that and its all trite and stupid.  just be yourself.      high school WILL NOT MATTER IN 4 YEARS!  focus on your academics.  THAT IS FOREVER!    trust me.  dont make the same mistake I did.  I fell for that trap.|`|AdmTQvT8aa	you're beyond help. why are you asking a bunch of yahoo misfits to help you plan your life?|`|Jbr1UquLaa	If you find a guy you like, go for it. but don't pressure him into anything you don't want to do. Really, you should wait for anything sexual till you are a junior (11th) it is when your body is physically and mentally more prepared for the emotions that come from it. But kissing, holding hands, cuddleing that's all cool.|`|55Jpjrsyaa	Stay single but approachable.  I dated a guy for 8 months my freshman year...come to find out, he was cheating on me the whole time with a senior girl.  Then after 8 months, I felt more isolated because I concentrated on him and not getting to know other people.  Make friends in high school...do well in school and just have fun...stay safe too.|`|HgTHO5Yyaa	Go with the flow, don't make it ur priority to have a bf, but if there is someone in school u like, then go for it! Don't waste ur time with someone just because u want to be able to say "I have a boyfriend." See where u go, if u do have a time this year where u just want to concintrate on school or whatever that's cool 2.
oP7Wg2wAaa	Try getting into a relationship with a guy and go from there, it probably is your hormones or something. So try getting a boyfriend or a guy friend.|`|af501a7c93ee2ad6da0e88f1bb573f14aa	aww well hunny to me is sounds like love well kinda but ya and your never to young for love well you should ask her if she likes girls first or may be she likes both you never know until you ask ok but either way you should tell her how you feel
PwG9QIVGaa	you are perfect!!! it's not wierd at all. girls that think virginity is wrong are retarted. it's somethin awesome that everyone gives away and uses like animals. its lucky youve kept it. it's not neccesarily cute, it's awesome, very attractive. at least to a morally nice girl that'll treat you right, she will love that about you so don't ever think otherwise for some chick that wants to take it away. you are going to make a girl very happy since you were raised by women cuz you'll know everything girls like. don't go for someone that'll mess you up. find someone unique  like you =)|`|1hH8qVYFaa	Because for women that's a big thing. It shows that you have respect for them and that it's not all that you're about. So therefore its "cute".|`|x53u6JRxaa	the most attractive thing in the entire world, save it 4 somone special
emlGhzViaa	Without knowing what you do on these dates it's pretty hard to see where your going wrong. There are lots of books on dating that you will find LOADS of do's and don'ts of dating etiquette. The only advice I can give you is to be yourself. Don't try to be something your not because as the relationship progresses it will be harder to keep up the charade. Also don't hold back too much but don't come on to strong, people tend to think they can't show any sort of strong emotion during the first couple of months, the bloke then tends to feel your not that interested and scarpers. So let the guy know that your definately into him but show no signs of desperation.  Good luck!x

uDzsQGyBaa	Men love the thrill of the chase. Men hate to talk about feelings. He got freaked out of the idea of how much you miss him. You should talk to him, maybe even go out a few times, but just take it slow and don't show him that you're so into him. The minute you give in, he'll stop chasing you.  Taking things slow will keep him interested, and you will have enough time to get to know him and decide do you want to get more serious. Don't let yourself get too emotional in the beginning, because that way you can easily get hurt. Just enjoy your life as it is, and make him earn the place in your heart!|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	I think I answered this like 2 days ago...    Shock. The guy didn't expect you to tell him you liked him or you had feelings for him, and when you told him that you DID, it came as a shock to him. Sort of a "Holy cow, she DOES like me" kind of thing.    It was the same when my girlfriend told me how she felt, and that was 5 months ago...|`|CzofnDAEaa	nope. just keep being honest. best thing you can do|`|WVhYsZ2Yaa	I'm a guy, but for some reason i dont freak out when a girl opens up to me, its just the way i am. But you gotta understand that most guys in general will "freak out" cause when a girl talks about her feelings, its just too much for a guy. They feel overwhelmed or even under pressure in a way cause you are about to share painful feelings that might scare them off. And dealing with feelings can be very complex. You can only talk about them to someone who you can trust and who understands you!    For this situation to work; if he truely likes you, he will listen to whatever you have to say and make you feel better and won't hurt you.     If he's getting freaked out when you said the emotional stuff; then he is just not ready for this kinda thing; maybe you are better off as friends.
wvoxTwcSaa	Yeah I have a few but the one that comes to mind is one of my little sister at my moms wedding. She was only like 4 or 5 and she decided after the ceramony that she wanted to get my mm a rose out of the pool and feel in instead yeah it scared us at first but now we all look back on it and laugh. Then the one for my oldr sister is this one , See our dog loved when us kids put our hair up in a ponytail and my sister came to visit and did not know this so she was laying on the floor when the dog came up and started to drag her across the floor by her hair she was laughing so hard after words that she constanly wore her hair up around the dog after|`|vuIIRuekaa	yes, way to many, Kodak Moments, how about you???

Y2rdBlosaa	Both guys and girls settle sometimes, instead of taking the time to find the one they actually wouldn't mind being with the rest of their lives.     Proceed with caution on this long distance relationship, especially since she already is in a relationship. That kind of girl may always cheat or look for someone else. Would you want to be in that boyfriend's position? You better make sure that you know she loves you before you decide to dedicate to any relationship.    I think you might have fell in love with her personality, but you won't actually know that until you meet her face to face.|`|24XGvxUjaa	While you and this girl have clicked on a social level, and I am sure, deeper levels as well....You guys don't have any face to face contact, nor have you physically seen her interacting with others and that is a lack of a realistic relationship. I know you don't want to hear this, but long distance relationships don't work out...It is just an honest fact of life.  Believe me, I have been in one....and it is more like having a very close friend than having an actual bf or gf.  Girls do just settle for guys...They want to feel loved by someone who makes them feel good about themselves. Most every girl that is not Paris Hilton feels as though she is not beautiful and needs that reassurance...In fact, women find their self-esteem based on what men tell them. That is a power that men sometimes don't even though that they have....Yes, and you are very right, girls don't want to be out of their comfort zone...She may be comfortable with this guy she is with, and she can't see past anything else but this guy for whatever reason....

Hope i helped|`|rSlC9k6xaa	I know they might go ahead and get together anyway. But I say warn your sister well and truly about your friend. And if you have to threaten to beat the living hell out of your friend if he hurts your sister. And you can only let them try it. But I tell you when they get to that "sexual" phase of the relationship, (real sorrry for saying that) it will get alot awkward for you for sure. I mean your friend bringing her back to your place and you can hear them and crap. Just wrong on so many levels. I think you should make up some ground rules on what is not acceptable so you are weirded out by this on any level. But yea again seriously talk to both of them. And make it a well known fact that the friend will get a beat down if he does hurt her or even talks about her more than he has. But a real red flag should be that he was disrespecting her in the first place by saying he would do stuff like that in front of you. So I'm sure sooner or later you will have to "be pounding" some fist into him. But good luck.|`|bbb54bf0ec8402ddca69477ca36c6ddeaa	no one is ever going to be good enough for someones little sister, if she likes him give him a chance and tell him what you'll do to him if he hurts her lol|`|32d3e1d0cda65519a3b3e595132e13a3aa	If your sister wants to date him let her but worn her of the things he has said about her that he wants to tap that and if your sister still likes him, then let her decide on there future.  Be weary as he is your best Freaend and if he would have said stuff like that about my sister I would have told him to **** off and find another freiend.  May be its better to lose your best friend then lose your sister.  From James.|`|tXYyqA5daa	he's made it clear that he's only wanted this whole time to have sex with your sister. he's no friend to you, and no good forher. she's not missing out on anything. sit her down and tell her that all he wants is sex, and all she'll get is hurt. if she doesn't believe you and keeps insisting that you are letting her miss out, then tell her to do whatever, but you aren't giving permission, or blessing, or anything, you want no part of it. it's her life let her make her mistakes. just be there for her when he hurts her. and I'd suggest a new roomate and best friend, he's obviously no friend to you if he doesn't care that he'll hurt your little sister.|`|fCF7tZ4qaa	well you can't protect her, she has to do that for herself... just tell them that you wont be getting in the middle of it if they wanna be together and then no matter what, don't...
iQJx6eitaa	Maybe he just needs some time to cool off.  I mean if you explained to him how sorry you were and how you didn't mean to get wrapped up or act immaturely about things there is really nothing more that you can do.  Talking to him may just aggravate things.  You could try talking to his ex and getting things resolved by explaining that you're not trying to damage the child and fathers relationship in any way and would like to make things right again, but she may just want a fight and you may not be able to control your temper and that could be disastrous.
R4KsqT1waa	I guess you are in love. To know this, just be frds for sometime. Try to know what she likes and hates, her frds, her home or even her family, after all what are frds for?    After sometime you think you have know her better, sit back with some coffee beside you and really thin abt what you feel for her. If what you feel for her has increased then you are in love but if what you feel for her is still the same, then you guys shd be frds.But it what you feel for her has decreased then you admire her.    Also if you think you are afraid that she will deny your love, then you have to test her love. Try and fake some minor illness and let her know abt it or try and get yourself into some minor troubles and keep records of all her reactions and what she will do to help you. If she loves you, you will see it for yourself.    Good luck and I think this remedy will work like magic. Don't forget you coffee. lol|`|OeoF9n6naa	u love her but u cud b infactuated so try b frends with her 1st then c how it goes ask her on a frendly date.then take it from there..|`|d3417e8466088cd5fdcb651298f5c735aa	Bad news. You really can not go after any female you work with. If the relationship goes south you are reminded of it every time you go to work plus you have all sorts of sexual harassment issues in the workplace.  Now if you do want to purse her you tell her you like her first. If you get serious too fast you look desperate. Right now just 1)take care of your business.(dress right ,act right)                  2)Talk to her, get to know her. 3) Ask her out for coffee or lunch something non threatening. 4) If you feel the vibe and chemistry then ask her out for a date 5) a month later you tell her you love her. You gotta play it cool.  What will win her over is your confidence and security in yourself.|`|Qef9BLBHaa	I always believe in writing ,so Write a nice letter that explains your feelings and ask her to let you know .if she answers you then take it from there.|`|565b37827f0a239a6583559ff95473ecaa	I think you may be infatuated with this girl.

Im sure that this is now the the right time for you to move, dude dont keep that feelings as in secret just let her know ..now.....good luck!
o2XqUG5Yaa	you seem like a pretty cool kid... from what you're saying, it really seems like she's not all that interested.. she's probably trying to be polite... you can either keep trying (be persistent) or move on...    no, it's not love that you have, since it's clear you don't know her enough to really fall in love with her...     if you want to be keep trying, just be prepare for the worst... meaning, she can literally break your heart... but if you wanna keep trying, find out more about her.. through her friends or something... maybe you can find something that you both have in common...|`|T3dtiANZaa	10 times out of 10 thats a no.

Sorry, just dont get your hopes up.|`|BC4JGzW8aa	it sounds like a no sory buddy i think she's leading you on why would she need 3 month to make up her mind|`|MhEEgdb4aa	im 13...if she says no...u will move on and fall in love for real the next time,dont worry what she says just kick it with her and first get to know her because she is thinking about going out with u but if she doesnt really know u she will probably say no so just express urself to her,good luck|`|53j2N6g4aa	Hmm....I actually think she is trying to say yes. It's hard to say yes on the telephone, and she is trying to make you curious. Good job for asking her out, you are strong.|`|AOljqnf8aa	true true true...     she is just leading you on. Trust me i used to do that.    here's what you go to do.     make it seem like you are no longer interested, she'll see that she doesn't have your attention any more and she will do anything to get it back. I am not sure if she is the right girl for you, just play it cool and don't make it obvious that you like her.  enjoy your summer!!    good luck!|`|OQ9iTTymaa	if it is taking her almost the whole summer to answer i really dont think she is that intrested and you should move on and find another girl|`|e383da544c62f027c17fe778e4d7e136aa	Okay, young man.  While you are still awaiting response from this girl, ever thought of going out and do something really fun?  Watch a movie, perhaps?  I loved the Simpsons Movie.  It cracked me up real bad!  Oh, and how about the Harry Potter movie?  Bourne Ultimatum?  Don't just sit around and do nothing.  Pull yourself together, Man!  You are going to end up miserable and possibly hate all women for the rest of your life, just because this girl keeps you waiting.  Stay Cool and sane.
GoABmevnaa	cut the guy some slack.. maybe he's kinda nervous around you, or maybe he's just a quiet guy. This is kind of how my bf and I are, except I'm the quiet one and he's the very outspoken one. We just fit together perfectly because our complete differences. Try making him laugh and feel more comfortable.|`|qbR9wOxMaa	These guys have no idea what they're talking about.<br>  That's a kind of dumb reason to dump him...<br>  <br>  Just playfully threaten him to talk more or you'll leave.<br>  But don't really, just because he relies on you is not a reason to dump him.<br>  <br>  Rely on each other, that's what is best in a relationship.|`|CceiP7q5aa	ive been with someone like that i got mentally exausted and felt like he was making no effort.. you could ask him more questions what do you think about...? etc <br>  but i just ended it, he bored me too much..|`|4IHe4rPYaa	tell him! if he doesnt still dump him dont waste ur time with someone that relies on you for something like that|`|gFgwFPDLaa	lol.<br>  <br>  YIKES.<br>  <br>  its time for byebye|`|Y6YaMR34aa	maybe hes wuiet|`|OUtEtm2vaa	ok ask y he doesnt talk to you|`|vsbuV9wCaa	ok?|`|dXdYFFuhaa	Sit your boy friend down and tell him that he can't do that anymore.

If hes boring, and you don't like it leave him...|`|2JBwCLwgaa	he's probably just<br>  Nevous that happens to guys like us when we REALLY like a girl|`|XXOjLWkhaa	Tell him to talk more.|`|CMUIzd32aa	life is to short to listen to a person like that ,|`|TCYrvsaZaa	say kiss my *** and then leave|`|tK7XacH7aa	Maybe he's trying as hard as he can to make a conversation. I am pretty bad at small talk right now and just doing the best that I can and try to at least start some conversation. I'm quiet, so that kind of explains it, but I'm trying to talk a lot more. You shouldn't make every conversation, but you should let him know so he may be persuaded to try a little more. According to other people that are saying to dump him just talk with him about this, that maybe he's trying his hardest but can't come up anything. If you dump him that's going to hurt him a lot if its only for that reason, if he's trying it will hurt him worse then if he wasn't. <br>  You two have to solve this problem. Tell him that you want him to make at least 3 starting conversations each time you see him so that you know he's going to at least try. Increase it by 1 every once in a while till he gets better at making conversations.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	everyone has their own personality and you have to take it or leave it|`|tsfbV5PPaa	Maybe he is just shy around you. Maybe he just doesn't know what to say. If he bores you, I would break up with him for someone new. Because I never stay with someone who doesn't talk enough. I love relationships where me and my guy talk for hours and don't run out of things to say. It's much better that way.<br>  xoxo<br>  Kiki|`|xvtufc7faa	Then he's not the type you're looking for. Usually, if he's into you or you two are in a relationship, you guys can talk about anything. If he doesn't even start a convo, then girl, dump him and find a better one b.c u deserve someone better!|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL TELL HYM HW YU FEEL AND TO SEE HW YUR REALTIONSHIP CAN GET MRE INTRESTING|`|z3QsWmzpaa	just say talk to me and say stuff like hows your day been
a0lrZujUaa	It seems pretty obvious that he is going out of his way to talk to you. Is there any other reason he would do that? Think of it from the point of the view of the guy, why else would he make conversation with you? If you can't think of any other reason, then it seems likely he does like you. You have to realize that he takes a risk of being rejected when he converses with you, he must want to have something to do with you!|`|DPizKr1Faa	If he talked to you nervously, probably he does like you! <br>  Or if it was awkward, then yeah probably.<br>  <br>  Otherwise he might not! :)
AA11857809	I would tell her to go see a doctor, then tell him to kiss my a$$ goodbye for not having the balls to tell me something that important.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	If was something that was not life-threatening, I'd get over it.

JhvqUvlsaa	I think you should talk to your gf alone and tell her why in this case it wouldn't be such a good idea. Tell her what you said here that in different circumstances you don't have a problem with people in high school sleeping together but explain why in her case it's a bad idea (she's a virgin, etc.). If she doesnt listen, at least you said your piece. And talk to your guy friend too and tell him that you don't think it's a good idea that they sleep together, for the same reasons. Tell him that if he doesn't care for her then he shouldn't have sex with her.<br>  <br>  If niether of them listen and it happens anyway, at least you tried to get them to do the right thing. But hopefully you can talk sense into at least one of them.|`|goe3y4FPaa	me and u should be having it too.. call me..|`|zgDxpqRsaa	dont butt in if something goes wrong you will be blamed(x periance)<br>  <br>  just give him your point of view|`|d07861561c1ae1f3be24fc58fcebdcf5aa	u can talk to her but remeber people do what they want to do regardless of what others think. now to me he knows how she feels and he is proably the type that just wants sex and nothing more so i think he knows he can pretty much get anything from her and when he does then it will be over quicker then she knows it.sad but true. u also need to let her know that just because she wants his babies doesnt mean she will have him
auUeI2Vnaa	I don't know if it's normal, but it sounds perfectly rational to me.  In fact, I like that idea so much, I may have to put something like that in to my will.<br>  <br>  My boys are only 3 y/o now though.  Actually, today happens to be their 3rd birthday!!  = )<br>  <br>  edit.  Sounds like your Aunts and Uncles are just being greedy.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I seriously think that what ever they want to do with their money is their business.  I do think that they have done the right thing though.  By leaving the children of their son some of the inheritance then they are in a way seeing that their son got his part.  After all his children are his heirs aren't they?  The aunts and uncles who are against this are just being greedy.  It's your grandparents decision and none of anyone else business.<br>  Red|`|IKXZZDH9aa	It sounds like it to me. I think that the whole idea of giving an inheritance is to help better the family your children produced outside of you if they created one.<br>  <br>  Your uncle's and aunt's sound greedy to me.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	What's up Magic Ball? I like reading your responses. I find them humorous. In answer to your question I would say screw the inheritance. Blow the money before checking out. But that is just me.|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Understand that your cousins have lost their father. Your grandparents have lost their son.If I were in the same situation, I would definitely give a percentage to my son's children! Reason - Gone but not forgotten - I think your uncle's children will respect that they are thought of!|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Why is it a bad idea? Had he not passed before them, and gotten his inheritance - it would have passed to his children.<br>  <br>  It was the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  If your grandparents died Intestate - it is how it works.  It is normal.|`|XbFEFJsgaa	im confused, who else is suppose to get it beside the kids? or his wife and to the kids? if i die only person getting my insurance money is my wife, i trust she will use it to take care of our kids and herself. my parents and siblings can worry about them selves.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	I think it fair to leave it to the offspring of the deceased, therefore the deceased will get it through genetic right. ( their children are a part of them)|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I don't think its a all or nothing situation. In my case I would probably leave everything to my surviving child. That's a thoughtful question|`|dVlLahozaa	don't know about legal terms so I couldn't tell you consult a doctor.|`|2YX18RE2aa	It appears that the father set up an insurance funded trust for the kids. <br>  That would be the result of good planning.<br>  <br>  For the distribution of an estate it is entirely appropriate to make sure that a child's share go to their children.<br>  <br>  The concept that the kids are already set up seems a bit selfish and jealous on the others part. I'm wondering if that trust replaces the love of a father which has passed? I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Apparently these children would be your cousins.<br>  <br>  I think it really is a stretch to suggest that an heirs children should be shut out of an estate because their father did not live long enough to collect.<br>  <br>  When you look at this it really does not speak well for the attitude of the other aunts and uncles that they would think about cutting out the nieces or nephews because their brother died already.<br>  <br>  Even if they need the money it really speaks of a significant lack of fairness. That they don't need the cash themselves only makes them appear more greedy.<br>  <br>  And BTW- Props to my favorite BILF|`|D7KwEaoXaa	I would split it among their children too. But they don't get it until they are 30.<br>  <br>  Here is why: If that child was still alive, they would share it/ spend it with/ leave it to... their children. It isn't fair that those grandkids not only lose a parent, but get ignored in their grandparent's will too. All the other grandkids will see benefits from that inheritance through their parents. Whether it's in paying for school, a nicer house, a family car, a vacation, going out of debt, whatever it might be.<br>  <br>  Be it dead or alive, that child has right to that inheritance, and if they have surviving family, that family should get some of it unless there is reason to believe it will be misused.<br>  <br>  The reason I say wait until they're 30, is because they need time to grow up before they inherit. They may even have a family situation that the inheritance could help with at that point.<br>  <br>  That is what I would do.<br>  <br>  P.S. I am adding based on your additional details.<br>  I think it is a horrible frame of mind for someone to think that half a million dollars is more than enough for them. They lost a parent!! The money is not going to replace them. I think your family members are turning ugly because all they can see is the millions, and not their hearts. I still would split it. Absolutely without a doubt!<br>  <br>  I also think you are a very smart and mature person to not give in so easily and believe the same thing as your aunts and uncles. You have a head all your own, and don't give in to other ideas too easily. Good for you!|`|qxDUoPBkaa	It's very common. In law it is referred to as per stirpes - or by the branch, as opposed to per capita - by the head. Meaning that depending on the jurisdiction the laws of descent and distribution will either distribute an estate (in the absence of a will) either per stirpes or per capita. In your case it is distributed per stirpes, it is divided amongst the children and if one of the children predeceases then that portion is split among that person's offspring if they are then living. Not unusual at all.|`|m69WRghvaa	It is actually a pretty common practice in life insurance.  It is called Pers Stripes.  Translates to "by the bloodline".  So money would go to surviving children (grandchildren) of your grandparent's children.  I don't think a lot of people do it, because they don't know about it.  I recommend it to my older clients as a way to make sure money goes where it needs to go without having to update a beneficary form all the time.  Of course, this doesn't work if you want to exclude certian grand children. <br>  <br>  Personally, good for you with agreeing that your grandparents should enjoy thier lives.  Nothing written in stone saying that you should leave something when you are gone.|`|masYIMRWaa	Anyone can do whatever they want with their possessions. I am single and have no children. My relatives (nephews/nieces etc.) are taking it for granted that I am going to divide the estate equally among them and that no matter what they will inherit from me. Well...if they are not good to me ...they will only get $1.00 each and the rest will go to the local shelter to find good loving homes for my pets...and for them to look after the well being of hundreds of orphaned or abandonned pets.<br>  write your will /directive before it is too late. I might give more to one of my nephews and none to the others because he is the one who has been bonding with me more like if he were my own child.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I think it would all depend on the situation and the relationship I had with all these people. It's not like there's only one "right" solution - there are many solutions, and what may be right in one situation could be wrong in another. I don't see any problem with leaving part of my estate to the kids of my deceased child. Exactly why some of your relatives think it's a "bad idea" has to do not with the situation itself, but with their perception of the situation.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The idea is that you leave your estate to your kids, who will leave their estate to thier kids, etc.<br>  <br>  By leaving his portion to his kids, they have ensured their estate travelled along the same route it would have had he not died.<br>  <br>  I think it's really sick that your other Aunts and Uncles think they should get his share because his kids "each have 1/2 million dollars".  So what.  They have that money because it was part of his estate.  The money your grandparents WOULD HAVE left him would be part of his estate too.  <br>  <br>  The Aunts and Uncles are being greedy.
mnFTWfCZaa	I would give him a special title, not "maid". But yes, if you want him up there with your girls, just inc. the kilt into the theme. If your girls all have different dress styles or colors, then it doesnt matter, if they're coordinated, get a kilt that goes well with the colors. It doesn't matter if he's gay or not, if you really have a BEST friend who is a guy, I think he deserves to be up there with you, as long as your husband is cool with it.<br>  <br>  ps- i like the "bridesman" and "groomsgal" thing, it's funny. but also bride's attendant works too.|`|7dnwrUnQaa	as cheesy as it sounds there r no rules on how u a have to live ur life..if hes a really good friend then i say do it give a little surprise for ur guests if hes worth considering then hes worth the spot remember that day is all about having fun if u want him to b a part of it then go for it..but on the skirt thing not so much..lol|`|d5kt46e5aa	Anything is possible. Haven't you seen Made of Honor? Ask him what he wants to be.

He could, however, be a "man of honor", or an "honor attendant". You can have anyone you want in your bridal party - traditionally, it would all be females, but you don't have to follow tradition. It's entirely up to you how to structure your wedding.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	its becoming more and more common these days.  my sister in law did it actually. her brother was her Man of Honor, and another childhood friend was a "bridesman" and then it was me and a girl she knew from school.|`|EFYkci30aa	Yes, of course. I see no problem with it, I think that's great. He just wears a tux instead of a dress and stands on your side with you.  (I suppose he COULD wear a dress if he was that type of guy, but I wouldn't recommend it as it would be distracting and people would remember that more than your wedding itself).  Just thought I should add that JUST IN CASE.<br>  <br>  On a side note, just be prepared to blow off the intolerant jerks that will gossip about it, because you'll more than likely have people that will "disapprove." <br>  <br>   If he means a lot to you I for sure think he should have a spot in your wedding.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes a guy can be an attendant on your side. He would not be called a maid though. He would be Man of Honor or Bride's attendant.<br>  <br>  Edit: Regardless of what many replies say, you aren't picking out or approving who your groom picks for his attendants so he doesn't get a say in whomever you choose for your side.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	Honestly i don't know but considering this is your big day I sure as hell hope so.

The point of your wedding party is to have the people you want to have support you be there, regardless of gender.  Traditionally only girls stood for the bride because it would have been inappropriate for females to have such close male friends.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	you can have anyone you want stand up for you.  my sister preferred to be called the "BEST woman" rather than maid of honor.  you could call him friend of honor. or some other name.  it is 2009,,,,many of the "old" customs have went out the window|`|8cj6zRtsaa	of course!<br>  my best friend isn't even gay,and he's being one of my bridesmaid/maid of honor, and it'll be vice versa @ his wedding ( I'll be the best man/ groomsman)!

If he is going to lie to you then you deserve someone better who will be honest with you about everything.  Try taking up a hobby for a while to keep yourself busy, and your mind off the boy.

b0b2fde471b9f267d4e0783db94b4f0baa	you're in middle school. telling a boy you've been going out with for two days that you love him.

He thinks because he is going with someone younger it will cause him humiliation. If he is a true boyfriend he would be with you anywhere no matter what anybody thinks. A little advice also, don't tell him you love him so fast. Love is a very powerful word and you shouldn't say it unless you really mean it. Another reason he might be avoiding you is because to him you might be his 'side chick.' A side chick is a female that a guy has where she thinks she is the main female in his life but what they don't know there is someone more important. Keep all these factors in your head..Good Luck|`|AA10255555	easy answer u spooked him!  u NEVER tell a guy u love him until after a long time in a relationship, odds are u scared him off, try to back off and see if this time he approaches u later on!<br>  good luck|`|xCAbKKIOaa	idk y but this kinda brings back something like memories o well nvm umm idk he probably does like you is he shy? if he is then theres ur answer but if he isnt then he might be embaressed of u no offense thats just a guess so idk but im guessing hes shy cause he asked you on aim and not in person so yeah
sr7jX2wYaa	She  text you because  then  she doesn't  have  to  see your expression  when she  tells you, & thinks  she  is avoiding  you saying  anything about  it , even though  you have agreed  not to*|`|62ihLEDIaa	you should try to just let it go. she prob. has a lot on her mind... people complain all the time about things they do them selves. my little brother practically kills me every time i take the last of anything sugary, but when my older brother takes it my younger one doesn't argue. people are just weird, and we kinda have to deal with it, sorry i don't have any better advice.
54ro47TIaa	She is obviously immature and has problems with you that go beyond your own understanding.<br>  You have to hang in there until April. Get a lock for your door and don't give her the key (of course). If you don't have your own room, keep as little of your belongings at the place as you can. Leave just about everything but your clothes at a family or friends' house unless it is something you can take with you. Don't giver her any opportunities to get you when you're not looking and always be on gaurd.<br>  This, my friend, is a sad way to live, but it is only temporary. Wash your own dishes, make your own trash and let HER get fed up with the disgusting living conditions since you say you are never home. <br>  She has to just get bored and tired of tormenting you and the best revenge is to avoid it altogether and avoid her.<br>  Good luck!
hPkWZh3xaa	Well lots of things you have done like meals and a bath are good, but if the real issue is work worries, it won't solve the cause of it.  <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is prompt him/allow him to talk about his real feelings, and then say to him you are not surprised he is stressed. You sometimes need someone to identify how you feel and why when you feel that bad because you can't always see it.  Point out to him that he is only human and can't be expected to perform as if he is super human.  He probably fears failure and feels unable to go to anyone at work and admit struggles.  Let him know it is ok and that his mental/emotional health is more important.|`|AA12328916	Sounds like you're doing ALL the right things at your end.(keep that up, as he will appreciate that long term). New jobs with new responsablilities are **** & stressful hun, just be there for him, & TRY to get him to relax. I work with severe challenging behaviour, thats stress, taking a bashing EVERY day, but my hubby is with me all the way. Hope this helps honey. Just keep loving him. 5 years thats good nowadays. me 29 years married. Very best of luck xx
EMKuBql8aa	Just let it go and breathe. You can't control what other people do, but you can control how you react to situations. Letting her get to you to the point you are "wound up" and "stressed" is just silly. She isn't being affected by it, you are. Even though she sounds inconsiderate, just try to let it roll off your shulders.|`|O9MzZxyzaa	I think you mean "difficulty getting IT on with my sister."|`|7B4vcBTvaa	she probablys PMSING
lf8sddXkaa	Huh?  It doesn't sound like you actually spent any time together.  You can still be friends-call him.|`|R1Bl7bpbaa	time will tell....|`|0eNBqvfzaa	well, he could have just been saying "I love you" just as a friend. My neighbor & I are close friends & we always exchange I love you's. But it's just as friends. Unless he asked you out or you guys have an agreement that you two are an item, you aren't really in a relationship just cause he says that he loves you. I know saying those three words can be misleading, but there are different levels of love that people have for each other.|`|AA11018240	I doubt it very much. And he would proberly just break your heart again. Move on and enjoy your life and dont waste any more time on this guy..|`|qJAAY0jYaa	I seriously doubt so... sorry... its not likely he'll return.

AA10730122	My fiance and I are getting married this summer, and it's not going to be expensive at all. I recommend having a simple, elegant ceremony- no need to go over board and decorations, etc. And there's nothing wrong with having a small intimate ceremony with just close family. <br>  <br>  As for wedding cake, the bakeries of super wal-marts make some really nice ones for cheap. Oh! and wal-mart has some great, inexpensive wedding accessories, including decorations and wedding veils, even tiaras! <br>  <br>  And me, I got my wedding dress from Ross Dress for $30! A lot of Ross' have really nice, affordable formal dresses you could get married in.|`|blxlNHeCaa	Do as much as you can by yourself. Use fake flowers instead of real ones and make the flower arrangements yourself. (If you have hobby lobby or an equivalent where you live, you can easily find gorgeous silk flowers on sale for very reasonable prices and make beautiful arrangements. This can be a fun activity for you and your bridesmaids/mother/mother in law). Try to buy your wedding dress when it's on sale. Shop around as MUCH as possible. Don't be afraid to say, "well this place has quoted me for this price. Can you do any better?" Don't be afraid to haggle with things like catering, decorations, etc. If you don't want to be married in a church, you could have your wedding in a park and also use that same area for your reception. A park is a very cheap but pretty place to hold a wedding.|`|rI5Gmqfoaa	The best way to cut down on the price is by cutting the guest list.  You really don't need to invite 350 people to a wedding.  <br>  <br>  May is a great time for flowers, so have your family start planting peonies, hydrangeas, etc for you to use.  That way you can have some fresh flowers, even if you have to have some silk.  <br>  <br>  Use an ipod instead of a DJ.  Have a friend be the MC.<br>  <br>  Don't give favors.|`|7Is37fRmaa	My sister had wedding in a local state park it was very pretty. She asked everyone to bring a side dish and had a bunch of BBQs set up and provided all the meat and beverages. Afterward she had a bunch of games like horseshoes and croquet and kites for the kids. everyone had a great time only down side is if you had bad weather but hers was perfect!
sr7jX2wYaa	Just  totally ask  her about herself , Do not  say Anything  about your  self. Make  her seem that she  is  the only thing important. I am  not guaranteeing it  will work without knowing  why she  doesn't like you, but everyone likes to talk about themselves*|`|N4X8VSUvaa	give her compliments and let her know she is a very interesting person that you would really like to know her better.     If you know she doesn't like you why don't you ask her why she doesn't like you.  Sell yourself a little tell her that you can be easy to talk to, Find some common ground.|`|oUNST2Zgaa	make her laugh and talk to her about what she likes<br>  <br>  do NOT do all the talking, but dont say nothing at all

AA11312653	Please don't do this. It trivializes and degrades the solemnity of marriage to have a pretend wedding for the sake of nifty clothes and partying. It's only a wedding if there is a marriage taking place.<br>  <br>  That said, I love parties and I love the idea of couples reaffirming and celebrating their commitment to each other. How about this? Save up for a great party with live music, fancy cake, chauffered limo, oceans of champagne, seated meal and all -- but make it an anniversary party or a birthday party or a TGIF party or just about any kind of party, but NOT a wedding.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well you could have a vow renewal ceremony ... but personally I don't know why anyone would do that very soon after the wedding.  I would wait until an important anniversary or something - like 10 years or 25 years.  If you are already married, then you can't exactly have another wedding.  I mean some people do, but I personally don't see the point.  And if you didn't have the money in January, how can you afford it now?|`|blxlNHeCaa	instead of having a second wedding, why don't you save that money for a wonderful honeymoon, a downpayment on a house or car, or home improvements? Your wedding day is JUST a day. What matters is your lives together. Even if it was low-budget, it was still your wedding day. Spend the money on something more important that you two can enjoy together.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No you can't. You can renew your vows on your 10th anniversary but you can't call it a second wedding or treat it like one. You get one wedding to the same person and life doesn't offer do-overs.|`|aipChC3haa	I DEFINATELY think that you should =)<br>  It'd be very sweet and show her that you ADORE her.<br>  I wouldn't suggest doing it so soon, maybe sometime later this year?<br>  You can just re-do the whole thing because people will understand that your last one was just TOO low-budget, and honestly it's gonna be the same as a traditional wedding.<br>  And, I advise to you that you save up around 20K or so to really give her the wedding of her dreams.  Trust me, it'd mean a LOT to her.|`|6s4cdeBZaa	You can do whatever you want. You can have a second wedding, you can just do a reception, you can renew your vows, you can call it a "Wanting to do it right this time" wedding and make it very light and funny for your guests....Do what makes you both feel good!|`|YfxydPF5aa	Obviously you would have to wait longer than a few months. And for the sake of nay sayers I would avoid calling it a "second wedding" and call it an anniversary party or something along those lines.|`|rI5Gmqfoaa	NO.  Have a party on your 5 year anniversary or something. The point of a wedding is to get married, you did that already.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Some people say "no you can't you had your wedding day". I personally say do what you want. It's your money. <br>  <br>  Just ignore the nasty posters.|`|wCyhrvAdaa	OF COURSE!! My sister couldn have her honeymoon last year around late august because of low budget, so they plan to do that this spring. Its alwayz possible for a second wedding. Best of luck 4 yuu both|`|MCFUmtFWaa	There is no shame in having a low budget wedding in this economy. It doesn't matter so much so long as you love your wife and she loves you!|`|IUgkylWqaa	You can have a 2nd wedding in 30 years when you renew your vows.<br>  Having one now so soon after you just got married would seem as if you're only wanting more gifts.<br>  <br>  If you wanted a bigger wedding you should have waited until you saved up enough money.... even though you were so in love, then you could have waited.<br>  Sorry, no do-overs.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's called a "renewal of vows", and it's up to you if you want to have one.
CBa9G4j4aa	I don't think so. Most girls don't like doing the chasing and that would be bad thing if you expected them to chase you all the time. And some girl you like might turn away and say I can't handle this and then you screwed up your chance.|`|H1qpJc6Daa	you should, but dont play too hard to get. I know some girls will get  tired of the mysterey|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	I don't think you should play hard to get with girls you like. It hurts them a lot if they like you. And it depends on what type of girl it is if it is a hard to impress girl and she knows you like her and she tries to play hard to get do the same. But, A sensitive girl would hate for you to play hard to get. Yes, flirt but still be mysterious.  That's another way to see if a girl likes you. Playing hard to get is harder.|`|WBtifYxDaa	No, be straight forward with the girls you like. Many girls hate it when guys act all uninterested when they are. Just don't be CLINGY.|`|FcqDWdF1aa	Just a little bit we like it but we also want to know u like us.;)
gavjd5XDaa	sadly some guys (and girls) are only looking to see if they can nail everything at work.....and come on girl, do you really want to see someone at work? it never ends well, and he's looking like one of those that will immediately lose interest and move on to the next one after he gets what he wants from you. you can do better.....don't say anything to him at all.....just smile and walk by like he doesn't exist.....and know you got the story on him from a guy who sees his type every day....|`|ixeIzWk5aa	It doesn't matter if he's been talking to other girls, that doesn't mean he likes any of them.  He could still like you and talk to other girls just to be friends with them.  Just talk to him like you always do, because none of the girls he's talking to are his girlfriends right?  So, it wont hurt.  Maybe ask him out to the movies or something to let him know your interested in being more than friends and so you can get closer to each other or get to know each other better.|`|44079b7c0b62c09b296ba51ac4ac1af1aa	Don't talk to him, just go back to talking to him like he is your co-worker.  If he questions your attitude change then tell him that you would rather him talk to you when you are the only one he is talking to.|`|d0024a843bcd19dbf4f93f1610283637aa	be his friend, us guys tell a girl that is friendloy, everything|`|tv6UiDKEaa	If you like him, and there's some attraction between you two, and you think he has feelings for you too, just talk to him/ask him out--make a move, and see where it goes (and make sure it's unrelated to work--no need for things to get confusing).  And also just realize that once you're in the "friends" zone, it gets kinda awkward.  But DON'T pull the "who's that girl" routine--just pretend like you don't know she exists.  If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be.|`|XW8KUBKDaa	Maybe joke with him coyly about it so he knows you know, but unless you guys decided to be monogamous than I wouldn't really make a big deal about it.

hoGpOrOUaa	to me, she seems like one of those girls who gets bored and uses people.<br>  she probably didnt consider your feelings when she was kissing you and was just using you as a sort of past time.<br>  <br>  don't waste your time with girls like that and if she tries to do it again, don't make yourself so available and let her know that she can't just pick you up and put you down whenever she wants.
J7Mmo5Xmaa	If this guy and his g/f relationship is on the rocks, why is the fool marrying her instead of dumping her for you?<br>  Next, how comfortable will you feel with the 8 yr age difference as younger more attractive girls fall for him and flirt with him when he says his relationship with you is on the rocks?<br>  How will you feel if you remain lovers and he has kids by this other woman ,she finds out and makes him stoip seeing you, or goes nuts and kills him,you or maybe both of you?<br>  Use your head here hon for something other than a decoration.<br>  The reason your divorced I'd say is you were either cheating on your hubby with this boy toy, or you just don't do well picking men.|`|EQydFhzmaa	Take a step back and assess the situation: if you really think you two could have something, and his girlfriend isn't the best for him, then you should get together and discuss your feelings for him - before it's too late (in other words: before he gets married). Keep in mind, every couple has quarrels, and you may be letting your feelings overshadow what really is, plus you are married and my just be going through a rough patch in your marriage - but you never know. Basically talk with him, and if he feels the same, then you go for it, you cougar! (Make sure they *and you* SEPARATE before you two do anything - you do NOT want to become the "other" woman.)<br>  <br>  Talk with him and your husband!

She might seem to be the happiest lady on earth to you, but she will soon find out that the grass is not greener on the other side, and hopeful when she does, you will realize that you deserve much better than her. My advice to you, is move on. When one door closes many more open. Move on, and enjoy your freedom. Someone better will come along.|`|BKGiVy9Yaa	I have to admit that, everything you read from here is just to make you feel better, no one is living what you have just suffered. I can say all I want now, but hell knows what I will do if this happens. So my advise is, forget her, forget him, forgetem all. If you have anger built up, let it out (in a safe way) destroy mentaly everything that causes pain and agression in your life because of her and live man, forget about what is more painfull, just dump it all and continue with life. <br>  Hang in there man, like I say; <br>  -"lifes a Whore, gives you pleasures then later charges you".<br>  (not everything is bad, nore everything is good, its all fate)|`|64X5RxRbaa	Some people have no morals what so ever.<br>  <br>  And then i wonder why people shun religion when it teaches so much about how to treat one another.

EMKuBql8aa	First off, you got it right, this guy is not only a jerk, but an a**. People like him because he has confidence is my guess.<br>  <br>  As to what to do, either ignore it or ask him this, "why is me playing sports so important to you? Because you spend so much time talking about me that I am starting to think you have it for me, like you think I'm hot or something, I dunno man...I don't go that way." Trust me, that will make it so he leaves you alone. <br>  <br>  My little girl might need a kidney transplant because her urine goes backwards into her kidneys causing too many bad bad infections.

AA10065812	???<br>  As you should have learned at the academy, she is making a Terroristic Threat, so you have grounds for filing charges.  But, what you need to know is that this could get a lot worse.  It can quickly progress to claims of child abuse, and even child sexual abuse, within two years, maximum.  Twenty years experience of working with divorced and single fathers has taught me that.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, I cannot advise you to continue this relationship, as it can disrupt your life, and even harm your career.  If you chose to continue this relationship, there are things you can be doing, as well as what he should be doing, perhaps starting with him preparing for a custody challenge.  But first, let me start with you.<br>  <br>  I have a three part questionnaire for you that can help in determining if this relationship is one you wish to continue.  There's a set of questions for the person entering into a relationship where a stepchild is involved.  A set for the parent of the child or children.  And, a set for the children.  Once done, the document tells you how to evaluate your answers and determine whether this is a relationship for you.  It was developed by Marilyn Coleman is a Professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of Missouri, Columbia.  Email me at papabear@cabaraoke.com and I will send it to you.<br>  <br>  As for him, show him this:<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|Hh92sQQbaa	It's funny she is a crazy girl.Just do they to get her mad maybe she's just a talker and wouldn't do anything to you.Or maybe kick her a!!.So she can stop getting in you're things.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	The father need to address issues to the mother..his ex about her communication with you..He can control this himself..|`|ehAG30Yvaa	For a 5 month relationship this sounds like more trouble than it's worth. If this was someone that you had been with for years and were planning to marry than that would be a totally different situation but your BF needs to get his ex under control before he brings anyone else into the picture. Whatever her reason for harassing you is I'm sure it's completely unjustified but unless she acts on it there isn't much you can do. She's obviously VERY insecure and hasn't completely moved on from her relationship with her ex and there isn't anything you can do about it. He on the other hand can talk to her and try to talk some sense into her since if they aren't going to be together, she can't harass every girl he decides to date. She shouldn't even know your name if you've only been dating for a few months because a 5 month relationship really isn't that serious. You need to stay as far away from this girl as possible. Don't communicate with her in any way and stay out of whatever she has going on with her ex. <br>  <br>  Honestly, it sounds like he still has unfinished business and isn't quite ready to be in a relationship if he's still dealing with these types of issues with her. Since you've done nothing to provoke her behavior towards you, I would get out while the relationship is still fairly new and find someone else who doesn't have so much baggage. It's tough to date someone who has a child because with that child comes another parent and it isn't always an easy situation to incorporate into your life. I married a single dad so I've dealt with issues with his ex before. Her and I are friends now but it took a long time to get to this point and I really think our situation isn't the norm. There are plenty of guys out there who are single and don't have crazy exes who will stalk you for no reason...go find one.|`|SHARt1k3aa	You have to ask yourself this... is a guy you've been seeing for five months worth all the baby mama drama?

( I know that if some chick took pictures and was "acting like a family" with my kids, It Would Be Smoke In The City. <br>  Why do you think that she is coming at you. Is it possible that your man might be provoking this. Why would she want to fight you if he is not sleeping with her, or saying things to her? <br>  What possible future can you have with someone that has baby momma drama? Maybe it is to soon for him to be dating anyone, espcially if he just broke up or divorced recently. <br>  I would say get another man, you are not engaged or married or got babies by him.

Anda adalah '' Anak yang hilang'', kini anda mau berbalik kembali jalan yg benar dan kembali  pulang kerumah yang benar, saya kira setiap orang tua akan bijaksana menerima '' anak mereka yg hilang'' untuk pulang kembali.    Anda tokh telah menyadari semua perbuatan yg telah anda lakukan.  Mungkin anda akan memohon maaf didepan mereka.    -  carilah kontak langsung dengan keluarga anda,     dan katakan anda ingin pulang    -  terus teranglah anda memang '' bersalah''.     dengan ketulusan hati ini, saya kira orang tua manapun     tidak akan menolak.    -  berdoalah menurut agama dan kepercayaan Isna, hanya     ini yg akan memperkuat maksud mau pulang.    -  berubahlah , hanya ini yg dapat anda yakinkan dan bukti     kan kepada keluarga anda.

Even if you went to a professional seamstress and had alterations done, they would have to add a panel of fabric to cover the bra.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You already asked this and I replied. End of.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I think the dress is actually cut down lower then the bra does, and if by chance Im right, it could lookfunny, or your going to be concerned about it all day, why not just have the dress be altered to fit in a bra? Or you can always buy those suction cups instead.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	I don't think so.  The dress is so low cut in the back and the bra goes up just a bit farther than the dress will.  I think the bra will go up a good 2 inches more than the dress.  <br>  <br>  Have you considered sticky bras.  They just cup the breast.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	It's a close call whether the bra would be fully concealed by the dress. Without testing both.

I am kind of in the situation you are- except my boyfriend didn't cheat. He just got accused of it, so when he takes too long to text or call back, I wonder what he's doing and where he is. <br>  If he cheated, I know it must be really tough. Tell him how your feeling and that you can't let it go, and he should make an effort to comfort you & earn your trust back. Otherwise, he doesn't deserve you..|`|8a65VDAKaa	you need to start trusting him... did he say he regrets it, and he's sorry, and he won't do it again?  hey, sometimes people slip.. <br>  <br>  one of the most valuable assets of a person is the ability to forgive. not forget, but certainly forgive. im not saying to be a sucker and let him walk over you, but if there are no clear signs that he is cheating again, just let him be. guys need space, specially at his age (im assuming hes around ur age). <br>  <br>  dont smother him, but dont be a fool.. learn to trust, and to put the past behind you. otherwise, your relationship will not work out.|`|TIZc5nrSaa	Unfortunately, my husband cheated on me when we first started dating and now that we are married, i still think about it sometimes. I know deep down that he could do it again, if he wanted to , but i have to trust that because he loves me, and i love him, that he won't ever do it again. In my heart i had to forgive him.. But the truth is you never really stop thinking about it. Give him another chance and see if he does it again, but this chance around don't put your heart all in it...<br>  Cause he might hurt you, this is the time where you sit back and think how much does he love me... Cause the truth is if he loved you as much as you love him he wouldn't have done it in the first place. I have forgiven my husband only because i love him more than anything, and that is what it comes down to!|`|rCYIWvwraa	You don't love him.  You're in love with the notion that you are in love.  He doesn't love you.  Love doesn't cheat.  Doesn't even look at other people.  True love is yours forever.  It just isn't with this guy. Infidelity in any relationship, on any level happens in stages.  Soon you'll get past the phase you're currently in and go to the anger phase.  Don't let this phase change who you are.  Rather, let the anger be felt, then turn into a discovery of all things great within yourself.  The world will always be yours.  Even love.  Good luck in love.

62a38dd9f22c45484705c219ad9e5e3eaa	You are young, yes, and I admire that you admit that. Most people in high school try to live and act as though they are grown when they haven't even experienced living on their own or what it means to truly and completely support themselves. It's great you've known each other for awhile, but friendships and relationships aren't the same. And, yes, you are young. There is much personal growth to be done, especially when you get out of high school. You will experience a big transition if you decide to continue to college and when you really begin to live an adult life. You will change. You will both change. Your responsibilities and priorities will change. Getting married is a big step and if you truly love each other, there is no reason to rush. You should allow yourselves to grow as individuals and not only as a couple. Let things flow and don't rush. If things don't work out, look at it as experience that helped you become wiser for your next relationship.     I was with my husband since I was 17 and didn't get married until 8 1/2 years later. So we have struggled in our relationship through our transitioning from being teenagers to being adults. Trust me, there's always something new to learn about each other. There's no need to rush.

Dan seseorang yg memiliki '' kelainan'', orang lain tidak boleh mentertawakan atau mengucilkan.    Tuhan menciptakan dunia ini dengan isinya yg komplit juga memberikan matahari untuk menyinari, bukan hanya untuk manusia yang hidupnya normal.  Tetapi juga bagi mereka yang '' tidak normal''.    Situasi anda = '' Gay'', adalah penyimpangan dalam status sex .  Kelainan ini mungkin sudah anda bawa sejak anda dilahirkan.  Jadi bukan kesalahan anda, anda menjadi demikian.  '' Penyimpangan '' ini bukan ''penyakit'' dan juga '' tidak bisa disembuhkan''.    Sejak lahir anda telah '' Gay'', hanya situasinya baru terlihat setelah anda memasuki masa '' puber ''.    Lalu bagaimana anda menjalani hidup anda selanjutnya dengan menyandang '' predikat  gay'' seperti ini  layaknya seperti manusia lain yg normal ;    -  anda harus berpikir positif     perlihatkan bahwa meskipun kehidupan sex anda me-     nyimpang / tidak normal, anda dapat menunjukkan  pres     tasi yg positif dalam pekerjaan, studi, usaha dll.    -  tidak memaksa, bahwa keadaan anda yg ''  lain '' ini harus     menjadi '' normal'' agar diterima dalam kehidupan sosial     masyarakat.    Cobalah  Mike,  tidak seluruhnya gay itu rendah.  Lihatlah, banyak pencipta / designer terkenal di Paris rata-  rata dalam kehidupan pribadi mereka, mereka adalah Gay.    Cobalah !, tanpa pantang mundur.  Terimalah apa adanya diri anda sebagai sesuatu pemberian  anugerah dari Tuhan.  Dengan demikian hidup anda akan sedikit mudah. Percayalah!.|`|ak94rugAaa	Katanya gay ?   kok blm pernah ngesex ma cowok ?

Apakah kekayaan itu membuat kita semakin ingat kepada Sang Pemberi atau membuat semakin lupa.  - dll, dll...    begitu juga jika diberi cobaan berupa keadaan sex yang menyimpang, itu juga cobaan, apakah kita bisa mengatasi godaan/ujian atau justru larut...    saranku :  1. Perdekatkanlah diri kita kepada Tuhan, Dia yang paling tau kondisi kita saat ini, boleh jadi Tuhan sayang sama kita, susah, sengsara bukan bukti klo Tuhan tidak sayang, bisa jadi semua dosa2 yang telah kita perbuat disucikan dengan kesusahan.  2. Jauhi hal2 yang berbau gay atau yang mengarahkan ke hal tersebut, karena jika enggak, penyakit lama bisa kambuh...  3. Sibukkan diri dengan aktivitas2 bermanfaat, misalnya bisnis/wirausaha, kegiatan sosial, urusan kantor, olahraga, dll.  4. Setiap ada keinginan untuk kembali segera cari kegiatan yang membuat kita lupa akan hasrat tersebut.

W9PjNsfZaa	The best things in life always come along when you are least expecting them..Whats the rush? I didnt have my first proper boyfriend till I was 15..which was about a year ago..and any guys I was with before hand usually ended in un-necessary upset...So think of all the upset you are saving yourself...and as for not doing anything with a guy yet...remember, your not in competition with anyone..you are living your life at your own pace..and when the time occurs..the timing will be perfect...and also..  Who needs boys?...you do not need a guy to complete you! Just enjoy being you    -lulabee x-X-x
cDqz71QKaa	if you really care about someone you'll understand. But if you just makeout or kiss someone for the fun of it or because you want them than you just wanna be proud of your record.  Most of the time in a serious relationship your nervous around each other no matter what and find your heart beating too fast when your about to kiss.  So tell your friend shut up and stop being a fag|`|FcqDWdF1aa	It's amazing theres alot of passion & intensity too.It's wonderful;)|`|BFIo2nS3aa	make out for hours on end and then ull know....theres no word to explain the feeling you get when you kiss the person you like/love|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	It feels great! You get really into it and it makes you want to keep going. It makes you smile! :)|`|7RUqEJzLaa	If you like the person then it feels great.<br>  When you make out with someone you really, really like, you get this adrenaline rush. And it makes you smile. It makes you feel closer to the person. <br>  If you don't like the person though, then it just isn't a nice experience.

gjwNYcRYaa	No, that is not wrong. There are some issues that come up with any relationship and sometimes an age difference of ten+ years can make them more obvious. To me, age is just a number.

9QyrW2iCaa	I would say be honest with her.  Let her know that her family (is it more than one person?) threatened you and you don't want to continue to go out with her because it's too much pressure for you and there is an uncomfortable relationship already with her family.<br>  <br>  Any adult (I'm going to assume it was a parent) who talks to you like this, no matter how protective and caring they claim to be, is showing hostility.  If something does go wrong with this girl -- whatever it may be, even if it's only a rumor -- this family will let you have it.  They will let your family know and maybe anyone else as well. <br>  <br>  Threatening physical harm to you is NEVER a good sign.  If this family is comfortable talking like this, then you're in for some BIG surprises (and they aren't looking like fun ones either!)  The girl herself will probably have some issues due to growing up in a dysfunctional family like this.<br>  <br>  Don't ignore the situation with her and don't let her plead with you.  Hold your ground firmly, state your case and tell her that she is still special to you.  You have to stick up for yourself . . . there won't be a magical fairy that comes to your rescue to do this for you.  <br>  <br>  You're going to be OK, she's going to be OK and the farther you get from that threatening family the better!  It is important for you to have trust and get along with parents of the girl you are seeing.  Don't ever forget that -- because there will be many people you date along the way.  You don't just date a person, but their family . . . just something to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  Also, don't involve yourself ANY further with her romantically or how you've described above.  I can tell you that she will probably feel very hurt and very confused.  Stay with her when you break up and listen to what she has to say.  Be kind AND honest, but stick to your guns.  Don't go for the tears and the begging to stay together if there is any of that.  You will save yourself much trouble down the road.<br>  <br>  Heartbreak and heartbreaking isn't easy -- AT ALL!  I wish you the absolute best, in your future relationships and friendships.  Take care of yourself and do well in school.  Your future is up to you and you sound like an intelligent, caring guy.  : )|`|5zBzOaqsaa	You need to be completely honest with her. If you're honest, she will trust you more. You can be a good friend to her if she trusts you.|`|M4BUjVTnaa	Communication is the key!!! I would advise you to talk to her and tell her the truth. If she cares about you and cares about herself she'll understand. Don't lie cuz that'll just make it worse tell her now before she's too attached that way u don't hurt her or yourself. It's still early in the relationship so i think if u tell her now she'll be fine so just come out with it as soon as possible. The longer u wait the more unhappy u will  be.|`|tBmNM9XAaa	Haha oh man at least it wasn't the sex talk.  Those are fun.  But, I would tell her what you think.  What is the worst that will happen, she breaks up with you.|`|82PkTDwwaa	Why dump her? Just don't **** up! They obviously care for her and if you think she is worth it, you shouldn't want out because of that!|`|cMsC5a14aa	Well you cant just end it before you get hurt..more fish in the sea|`|gjwNYcRYaa	If you really do care about this girl, then talk to her about what was said to you. If you don't think that she is worth the effort then just let her down easy. If you cannot find a reason to break it up besides the fact of her family's doings, then maybe you should just see where it goes. Perhaps she just has a protective family. Their actions could be a result of many things. She may have dated someone abusive in the past, or it could be a culture difference. I would talk to her about it first though.|`|AA11457263	You really need to try to explain to her what her family is doing and try to talk to her about how it is making you feel. Some girls will understand and some girls wont. But you have to think about how it is making you feel and what is best for you. Good luck!|`|JpTl2JLCaa	tell her the truth. ur dad scares the **** outa u but i luv u

You sound very young and if you are under 30, then study hard if in school or college, stay and finish it.    Build a carrier, youth comes but once take full advantage of it.

6oljLtVkaa	Don't be so hard on yourself. So you fail the first exam. Think about your study habits and what you could have done better to improve the end results. Studying is not easy. Remove yourself from whatever environment that offers distractions. Turn off tvs, radios, and telephones when you are studying. Budget your time with regards to different topics or subjects. Hang out at the library. Your bound to meet others who are trying to accomplish the same goals as you are. Don't compare yourself to other guys either. You are only setting yourself up for failure. As for your depression.I think that it might help you cope if you were to talk to a professional. There is no shame in seeking professional help with personal problems. You are not unique in this area. That is why they are there. If you are enrolled in a city college, they have staff that are trained to assist people with your specific problems and the health fee that you pay at the beginning of each semester pays for your sessions. I hope that I have given you some insight. Good luck.|`|60727b7a69fa8d5147eadb2d20e17e83aa	you have spent 2 years like this, and recognise that you cannot go on like this, you have to let go of what you have lost, its gone and there is nothing you can do about that unfortunately, what you have to ask yourself now, is, are you ready to seek help, and move forward? you are depressed, and staying in the house is classic symptom, i know because i am there too, and seeking help does not mean a bottle of meds and on you go, i take no meds but have a therapist who comes to the house and slowly getting better. You have goals to achieve here, and in order to do that you have to look after yourself, phone your doctor, explain whats been going on, you need a bit of help here, ask for it, its way more common than you think, and you can make things better. i cant help you on your uni bit i'm afraid as i just dont know enough about it where you are, but there will be a counsellor on campus to help students, seek them out and talk to them too, no one can help you if they dont know you need it.

Which does get old fast.|`|AziyhELTaa	because its fun and keeps things interesting|`|lW8BqWvlaa	LOL! Why yes its pretty bizarre. She probably wanted a lil cat and mouse chase.|`|jTvpOSXAaa	Not really.  She was playing hard to get because she was expecting you to talk to her or ask her out.      Hope this helps and if you need any further advice feel free to email me at lala_lilly@yahoo.com.|`|AlaDVg9Qaa	no i a girl, and it is just testing you guys to see if you really like us...btw, kicking her to the curve, smart one...(sarcasm used)|`|129c398d855c8d5a2f73f6d2693bad0baa	One thing that I found out is that some girls liked to be chased, I don't understand it. But for most females that might be what there mother taught them, because they themselves did that. She may have done this to see if you would keep chasing her, because the more you do the more she would have realized herself that you cared for her.  I don't like to play the cat and mouse games but it does make you feel real good especially if you have an arguement for your mate to come running after you, it shows that they really care. She may have just not known when to stop, and you just didn't care enough to continue the chase and I really don't blame you|`|qUOAdGvFaa	Ha ha. Ok. There are a few reasons girls play hard to get. One is because for some reason, a 'fact' starting circulating among girls that if you act uninterested a guy will become more interested in them. On another note, girls are very sensitive to rejection. If we put ourselves out there and show we have feelings for someone, we're afraid someone can use that against us. She could have just been trying to protect herself.|`|nHrdqj9Jaa	it is a well known fact that people like what they can't have better. it works for both girls and guys. she's playing hard to get so you would prove to her that you really like her. and just between us, isn't it more thrilling than her being easy?   and about her saying you hurt her, well i think she expected you to try a bit harder not just give up. just my opinion, though
4UqL6SY0aa	umm run. lol. even if she does want you back RUN!!!!! no joke.    please answer my questions, thanks
rA9sQyHNaa	send her a rose... but leave it blank... dont let on who it is.. :) also.. I think maybe because ur showing u like her too much its sort of puttin her off.. like maybe your too clingy..(no offence dude) erm.. show her less attention and she will think.. ''hmmm i miss his attention'' and the tables will turn.. well hopefully... just once in a while pay her compliments.. but also try flirt and pretend theres this one girl that likes u but ur not too keen on her... and as for stalking a guy and using you as an acomplis (bad spelling lol) thats just sad... dont be anyones pedal stool.. u sound lovely x x x x take care ;) play the game and have fun doing it|`|8vfCRg7Caa	you highschoolers are going to die in the real life of dating. These questions are simple. Just go along with it. Either shes trying to make you jealous or she really is just using you for your friendship and you really dont have that kind of chance anyway. Whatever it is, just move on. Be her friend. You can never have too many female friends. Hang out with her. Just persue somebody else and let her know who you think is hot and such and such. If she cares about you, she will try to throw herself and try harder to get your attention, if she doesnt, then, shell say "yeah, that girl is hot" and good luck with that and such and such. Women are competitive, so if they see you drifting off to somebody else, they will step on the gas. The like to play hard to get but they dont want to cut the line. And you guys are young. Enjoy your space and thats she comfortable telling you things. Cause if you are that kind of friend she can talk to then youll be there for her when she move on with that guy.|`|rUsK9Egcaa	i don't think you still have a chance
1hzqBAScaa	you should really follow what you want to do but if you know for a fact that miss treats girls then i wouldn't go out with him, if you do try it keep your guard up and just be careful|`|8R6vAbkMaa	sounds like you're pretty smart..trust yourself..|`|euwI5KiHaa	dump his ***  he sounds like a butt  You shouldnt give him a chance if he's embarrised to be seen with him  but furry make sure that's the reason why he wants to meet OUTSIDE of school.|`|oGWQil5daa	Don't bother, he sounds like a tool.
XdqvvLaiaa	i THINK u should just not mention anything to him, let him come to you. I know its hard but it works. :) also give him sumtime. hes probably shy!|`|a9qrXBBsaa	i don't think he likes you if he doesnt talk to you. if he looks at you a lot, then maybe, but if he completely ignores you, he doesnt like you|`|DmcZn0T8aa	He is probably just confused or doesn't want to lead you on so give him space and once he feels ready he will begin talking to you again.|`|GbF7pqQDaa	Try to rebiuld ur relationship by talking about other things yall have in common. Usually telling a guy u like him ruins friendships.|`|eydwwJjDaa	He's acting weird. Sorry to say it, but he might not be interested.  But if he is, I would ignore him right back. This will probably annoy him and he'll end up talking to you.|`|m88ELjmPaa	You should just ask him if there is something wrong, he does not hate you for telling you but he might not want a relationship with you. just be brave and ask him on the man.
DLXmNX6Iaa	Usually if you guys click things should be unfold accordingly. Break the ice? just ask your date about themselves and stuff.|`|lGVW4jG1aa	double dates tend to not need ice breakers    especially at homecoming where you'll be dancing
ii3sdyPjaa	Well my fiance had my sister start randomly pointing out rings in store windows, in magazines, and online a few months before he asked me. She would just casually make comments about them and ask what I thought of them, then when it was time to look for rings he took her with him and she suggested some that she thought I'd like and then he picked from those. I thought it was a really good way to do it.|`|1KfbgBupaa	I definitely want input on which ring I'll wear.  If you want a solitaire you actually could give him enough details that he could buy that on his own.    If he is on a budget then he can go to a jewelry store without you, make arrangements with a clerk to show you the rings that are in his price range, and let you pick out the one you like best... but if you do this, you aren't allowed to say "oh, let me try THAT one on!"... only the ones that are offered to you.    Also, if cost is a factor, keep in mind you can always upgrade later.|`|cEHhv7Emaa	well, it's going to be on your hand for a long time, so some help in choosing your style is probably necessary. In the end, I think he should pick one out of a selection of five bands you like.|`|AA11082914	My fiance picked mine out totally on his own, and I couldn't be happier. It's perfect. He's a pretty simple guy, so I always thought that when it came to THE ring, I'd have to steer him in the right direction, but he did SOOOOOOOO good on his own!|`|hlcVsVQUaa	surprise|`|k3b2WQLAaa	have him surprise me. that would be more fun.    i would pick it myself only if my bf has a terrible sense of selecting jewelry.    please answer mine.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    thanks|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i chose 3 rings for my husband to pick from then he picked the one he liked the best. keep in mind your going to be wearing this ring with a wedding band for the rest of your life, it needs to be something you love.|`|o0ZSymtsaa	1. I would want him to find out what i like( example, plain simple gold bands, or ones with stones,or just silver...etc)  and then surprise me by buying that. If my fiance takes the trouble to find out what I like, it shows my preference and my wishes are important to him. and this is what would count more than anything else.     2. I would also like it very much, if we could choose the ring together. Before getting married, doing small things like these makes everything more fun.    Its a case to case basis thing. If you think your gf would rather choose it herself than doing that is better. if you know her, you would know what she would want.|`|4OIqHwkXaa	i'd rather be surprised with my engagement ring rather than pick it out myself for with my fiance it never seems as special when the couple does it together.|`|m4nYHrkfaa	I RATHER WOULD LIKE IT FOR HIM TO PICK IT SO I CAN SEE HOW MUCH HE REALLY LOVES ME.  ANY WAY WHAT EVER RING I GET FROM THE MAN I AM GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH WILL BE THE BEST RING INT EH WORLD|`|o7lAXurcaa	I gave him an idea of what i wanted. I send him pictures, sometimes he would ask me questions about it. And yes I love my ring!!!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Somewhere in between.  I would like my fiance to know what I like and have him pick from that.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I think it was wonderful that my husband chose the rings; much more special that way!|`|6dIJ8sUkaa	I chose my ring with my fiance and I wouldn't have it any other way. Me and my fiance went ring shopping together and we both picked it out. This way work for us and I am completely happy with my ring. I have a close friend that her fiance pick out the ring himself and the ring is beautiful. That way work for them. I would have hated to get something i would not have been happy with. This is a ring that i'm going to wear for the rest of my life I needed to make sure I would be totally in love with it.|`|agTCqkLDaa	Surprise all the way.  That's one of the most exciting things about it in my opinion.  I've never been engaged, but I don't want to go ring shopping because even though I don't know WHEN it will happen, I still know it will happen and I'll already know what the ring looks like.      I have a very strong feeling that my boyfriend is going to ask me, but I don't know when, I don't know how, and I don't know what the ring will look like.    The only satisfaction I'd get from going to pick out my ring is knowing that I'd get a ring =-P|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	Well with us. I kinda showed him what I liked and everything. Then it was like months later and he just suprised me with it. I wasnt expecting it at all...I didnt even know he went and bought it. So he knew what I liked, when he went to buy my ring. And I love it!!!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'd rather give my fiance ideas about the ring styles I like and have him pick it out. It's more special that way. I don't want to know he's going to propose or has even picked out a ring.|`|pub2GLZPaa	Same as first one- I trust him to pick it so long as he took me ring shopping and knew what I liked (white vs yellow gold, what cuts I liked, didn't like, settings, etc)    Actually we did that- I showed him precisely what I liked and I ended up with something completely different but equally as beautiful. :) One way or the other you really can't go wrong when you offer a girl a ring.|`|n68tCJ7zaa	i show my boyfriend styles that i like, and tell him that his first job is to ask my mom who knows exactly what i like    so it'll be a surprise what he comes up with, but he'll know what i like|`|M9s9SRogaa	My boyfriend is very sensitive to me, and knows pretty much what I am thinking all the time.  A few months into the relationship he got me an opal necklace that I absolutely love, and am actually wearing right now, two years later.  The only thing I have told him about an engagement ring that I want is for it to NOT stick out too much.  we both work in very hands-on jobs so we understand that too much is just that, too much.    So, I am looking forward to a surprise sometime in the near future.  I know I will love it, no matter what it looks like.  When a woman can trust her man to get her the perfect ring without (much) input, to me that means that they are really connecting, which is necessary for a successful relationship.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i picked out my own and kinda wish it would have been a surprise. i mean how bad could he have really done you know? lol
5vT3UDYaaa	I think its because in the American culture a guy who shows his emotions are often thought of as "sissy's" or "pussy's" and what guy wants to be called that? From infants, boys in America, for the most part, are taught to hold in their feelings and emotions in and NEVER CRY. Its sad really because then when guys get older they dont show any emotion in friendships and relationships and things go down the drain, especially with women. When a guy doesnt show enough emotion in a relationship we get all pissed off but then again we tell little boys not to cry, not to be sad, "be a man!", and then expect them to express these repressed feelings that he's never really ever expressed before and doesnt really know how to, later in life??!! wtf? How does that work? We as women expect men to sit down and "talk" with us. But how many heart felt talks do you think these guys had growing up? Not many, so starting when they're 16 and up and in serious relationships is really hard...I'd love to date a foreign guy who actually had emotions, but hey I guess thats the saying "the grass is always greener on the other side"..|`|D9k5Fou5aa	In Asia, the culture is to be more open about things like these and they aren't so insecure about emotional stuff. For example, Asian dramas are popular between both sexes, especially Japanese dramas that target all types of ppl. In America, there has to be a fine line between what men and women like...which is retarded. There's just too much division in America. Even in high school, u got all of these clicks from the jocks, cheerleaders, popular kids, nerds, etc. In Asian, you're just a freaking person!! Asians divide themselves over stupid stuff. In America, you're ridicule for actually studying and being smart, but in Asia, you're a person that is doing good for yourself. Also music, notice how most Americans wouldn't listen to music by young ppl and they divide themselves by decades and genres. In Asia, you listen to a song if it's good and it's simple as that. Another example are cartoons. Cartoons is a childish thing but in Asia, animation is targeted to all ages. Cartoons flashy color is something to attract young children in America, but in Asia, animation is an art. America is very closed minded if you think about it. They wouldn't even bother watching entertainment that is no stereotypical. If it's a love drama starring Asians, they pass.|`|77Ng0HT8aa	This is true in some ways yes.. I think american guys refer to them as 'sissy's' a lot of the times b/c they are more open about their emotions. But I was with a european guy at one time and he almost seemed more cold with his feelings.
R7oQ7Dygaa	they're not your friends anymore. they're being fake with you so you think they still like you so they can f*ck with your head some more and make **** happen to you. You have two options in this situation you can either believe them and let them keep f*cking around with your head and start doing things to really hurt you (maybe even physically) or you can just move on and get new friends that don't cause so much drama or problems. The whole problem is the new girl thats hanging out with them doesn't like you (who knows why? maybe jealousy) so she's either telling your friends lies to make them hate you or your so called "friends" think she's cool so they are going to do anything possible to fit in with her even if it meant you dyeing over they probably would do it. Oh and there is know way to ask your so called "friends" either because no matter what they are going to lie to you and tell you everything is fine and that you guys are all buddy buddy even though they don't treat you like a friend.      Oh and who cares if you were friends with them since 5th grade. I had friends in 5th grade that I stayed friends with a couple years and we went our separate ways... hell I had friends that I was friends with from kindergarden to 7th grade and we still went our separate ways. It's something thats bound to happen because as you get older your priorities change as well as your personalities due to personal experience and maturity.
bqB8Ed8Oaa	It was VERY hard so we dated other people but kept each other as close friends and promised if we were ever able to be in the same town, we'd be together as more than friends again. We kept that promise and are married now.        Good luck, follow your heart|`|kZLO00xGaa	Yes, three times. None of them worked out. I lost a lot of time and money. Time, a person can never replace. In long distance relationships, a person only knows what the other person is willing to reveal. But it takes a lots of time spent in person doing various things together and lots of open honest communication to really get to know another person.  |`|FzuQTyE6aa	I think it may work out.but just don't think he'll be faithful to you at least physically. anyway long distance relationship needs much more pation , but if u both really love... |`|KDTc2IpPaa	long distance for a year from Israel to Canada. We're engaged now. Staying together was the best thing that has happened to us to increase the health of our relationship|`|CaKu7gbAaa	i have seen many long distance relationships in my friends. some of they chose different paths and some of them who were really true are still together. it depends upon the intensity of love of both the partners. if love is true it will remain the same and would grow more with the time and hence relationship will also become more secure with the time. so see yours and partners intellect and real interest towards eachother and your relation.  sometimes we are not able to make relation workout while living under one roof too. so there is no question of long or close distance in a relationship.  ask this question to yourself that would you be able to maintain long distance relation truly, honestly with full intensity of your love? see what your heart says. both of you do the same and will get the true answer. EASY ENOUGH...|`|e5acb3af51b48dae1a6445da769c1569aa	yes. 6000 miles apart. 2 1/2 yrs now and we are getting married soon!|`|AA12292008	it can only work if eventually u get together face-to-face (but that also is not a guaantee!).  reason:successful and meaningful relationships require ingredients of: intimacy(and/or sex), doing things togethr, physical attraction,etc which are not achieved through long distance  i have been in several lont term r. but they all eventually died out a natural death. now i am married 4 yrs with an adorable duaghter to die for!|`|DuR26Pojaa	Yes, it worked. We had sex with other people when we were apart, and with each other when we visited.     That was 3 years ago when we were 2,484 miles apart.    We're still together.|`|TkT8XYDcaa	Still never have    SteveC|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	yes! i was a daycare teacher (the only male and youngest daycare teachers of all in the centre) before and the last day i left, every students missed me and asked for my cell phone numbers and i gave them and they didnt call at all after my 3 months leaving. BUT only one boy student who keep on msn me, sms me , and call me. he doesnt forget about me and i feel happy and touch. at least a person is still remembering me and still in touch with me although we didnt meet for 3 months! one day, i will find a perfect time to hang out with my ex student.|`|0YzmQWDsaa	yes on a couple of occasions. Neither time it worked. Distance wore off the feelings in a few weeks the second time and in a few days the first time.
Wrf5orAuaa	This problem will become worse for you as time goes on. You need an demonstrative affection and he is unable to give it. You've tried to get him to show it without avail, and if you tell him it's a dealbreaker he may improve....for a while. Then he'll slip back into his normal way.  Even though he's a good person and you like him a lot, I'm afraid it won't improve and will eventually lead to you splitting. Better sooner than later, in my opinion.|`|XojyuUfYaa	HELLO SOUNDS LIKE UR BORED WITH HIM N LOOKIN ,U JUST DESCRIBED URSELF AS ATTRACTIVE ,IN SHAPE,LONG BLACK HAIR,BLU EYES.IF IT WAS LIKE THIS IN THE BEGINNING IT WILL PROBABLY STAY THE SAME IF NOT LESS LOVE MAKING.MAYBE SOMETHING HAPPENED IN LIFE TO TRAUMATIZE HIM LIKE SCAR HIM DONT TAKE IT PERSONALLY ,IM SURE U ARE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.ITS BEEN 2 YEARS U SHOULD BE HAVING PLENTY OF LOVE MAKING N AFFECTION .STAY STRONG IF U LOVE THIS PERSON ,IF NOT GET OUT N SEE WHAT HAPPENS |`|2GJxvLf8aa	Tell him you need more affection. Now most likely to told him this and nothing has changed, so you need to decide if its worth it. Not being happy deep down inside. Or maybe if u take a break and he feels like he's going to lose you, he may want to change for you. |`|tkrFvCbhaa	Hello     Am like your boyfriend I behave the same way towards my girl. I do love my girl so much. Even if I do not show it openly. I can not leave her. Men usualy behave like this when they have fail to get there dream girl. They come to understand life later that they can find dream girl because reality does not offer what they wanted. |`|gRvHucPPaa	If there is a void and he's not filling it, or won't even make an attempt to, then there's a problem.  There are guys that just don't know how to show affection, and you can teach him in time, but its been 2 years.  It really depends on how patient you are, and if you think there is hope for him changing.  If not, you need to call it quits and find someone that can be what you need.|`|kWODqwl5aa	talk to him...  it may seem hard... but if u really love him then... try but dont settle for something thats ok... but theres this and this that bugs me.. especailly something soooooo big!|`|CBEgjyXeaa	oh dear, this is an important part of a relationship and needs to be settled before going any further    maybe he has medical issues or self confidence issues holding him back from performing?      mine: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|EKerOdhtaa	dump him.    Move on.    Find someone who will treat you the way you want/need to be treated.
bh7XBPuUaa	no. tell him exactly what you jus told us
AA10776535	That happened to me, the first time i thought maybe i didn't hear her knock the second i told her to back the F off.   I think i scared her she left us alone LOL|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Well, it is their job to help their customers get into the dress, and make sure it fits properly....some dresses are hard to do up, and some are actually impossible to do just by yourself.  They are also responsible for making sure that you don't damage or dirty their dresses any more than necessary.    It is something they do this day after day, and so they probably don't really even pay much attention to your bodily attributes.  It's kind of like seeing your doctor or gynecologist.  They have seen it so many times that it doesn't really embarass them or bother them.    If you feel uncomfortable with the invasion of your personal space, just let the sales people know that when you go into the changing area.  Tell them you will ask them for their assistance when you need it.|`|28WJwHf4aa	haha David's Bridal!! The lady kept putting her hand down my front to adjust it...in the open! Not even in the dressing room. It was extremely awkward! Luckily the dressing room was a door, but the fitting room for alterations was just skimpy curtains. I felt so exposed, especially since there were wall-to-wall mirrors directly in front of me. She did keep knocking on the door and would pop her head in...but then I just had someone stand in front of the door.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	why do we let people abuse us in this manner, why are we so polite. Next time I would just put my foot down from the start and say, "i'll call you when im ready"|`|Pwybznsxaa	I wouldn't be comfortable with that either, not at all! Not enough customer service in the world for that to be acceptable to me. If that happened to me, i would probably say "i'll let you know when i'm done, so you can see the dress" or "I don't like to be exposed when i'm not completely dressed" or something along those lines in a very nice manner and they should get the hint. If not, say it more stern.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well they work for commission and bridal employees are notoriously idiotic and pushy.  they probably think you need help because the dresses are huge and involved but they should ask beforehand if you need help.  next time you go, tell the person who's helping you that they are not to come into the stall as you change or you will leave teh store and they will lose the sale.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	They are trying to be attentive so that you are more likely to buy a gown from them. Most bridal salespersons work on commission - if you buy an expensive dress from them, they get a bigger check at the end of the week.|`|29I8PWrxaa	I think they are just trying to be helpful since some gowns are hard to get into and to do up.  They also want to help show you how the dress will look when it fits properly, which requires them to fiddle with it and sometimes touch you.  I guess if you are uncomfortable with it, just let them know.  They are probably just so used to doing this with other B2B's that they assume everyone doesn't mind.    LOL ... yeah that's a little quick.  I have not been to try on dresses yet but thanks for the heads up!  I work in a clothing store and I can tell you that some women don't mind if you "get close" to help them out while other women don't want any help at all.  Heck, I've had to shoo some women back into the change room who have come out half naked!  I think it's just different for every woman.  But personally, I think that would make me uncomfortable also.|`|Tledw3eAaa	You should definitely have said something to them, and let them know that you'd prefer if they asked before coming into the dressing room.    It seems rather rude to me, but I haven't exactly had a lot of experience in this area. Though when my mom was picking out her wedding dress a few years back, and I was trying on bridesmaid dresses, I don't recall the salespeople barging in on us while we were changing. They did stand outside the stall, and offer to take or bring other gowns when we needed them, but they always waited for us to open the curtain (or if it was an undergarment, they would pass it over the curtain above us).    It would have bothered me. I'd just suggest that if you are still looking, and it happens again, just politely say you'd be more comfortable if they'd ask before entering.|`|0Id85yiYaa	haha, weird.
wVXXPRmZaa	Keep yourself busy as much as possible. Talk to other guys, flirt with other guys..and try to spend lots of time wih your girlfriends.    Also throw out all the sutff he gave you or stuff that reminds you of him.  Put all pics on a box...because those are nice to look at later on in life...    Good luck!|`|nO2vflnPaa	stay busy and keep yourself involved with friends and family|`|TR2EDuLWaa	Just start talking to other boys and maybe you should talk to your ex for some closure. Maybe give him his stuff back if you haven't already. I would talk to him and think about what lies ahead|`|u70TaWI5aa	This is simple you have to do something out of the ordinary that you do not usually do. Go out hang out with friends enjoy life. Bike ride or do something active. All of these things distract your mind and sooner or later it will be like the guy was nothing.|`|KITQu2j7aa	strat by talking to people and get to know other men like me lol but it helps to talk to people we can talk just email me at wrick71@yahoo.com|`|mmAjpMX1aa	Stay busy.  Find activities that you enjoy.  Avoid listening to sad love songs or songs that you associate with him.  Box all the mementos or gifts he gave you and put them where you can't see them.  If he tries to communicate with you, do NOT give in to the temptation to respond...delete any emails, texts, etc...block his addresses and phone numbers if you have to.    Write a letter of all the nasty things he did to you and what you wish you could say to him...and then destroy it (by burning or shredding) in a ritualistic ceremony of blowing it all away (do NOT send it or post it, as such things have ways of coming back to haunt you months or  years later).    And as a last resort, you can try wearing a rubber band on your wrist and snapping yourself painfully whenever you find yourself thinking a little too longingly of him.    Good luck!|`|2xHa8IFeaa	You could watch the notebook eat ice cream and cry. lol   or go and get someone new.|`|r7tllHjuaa	Heartbreak sucks.  The best thing to do is try to forget him.  Go out with friends....  Keep yourself active so you dont have time to really think of him.  Surround yourself with people who mean alot to you.  Talk to your best friends, they are there to help.|`|FIMGjA4Waa	I think a way u can help is to forget the good things and think about why u hate him and why yall broke up. Then try finding someone else to go out with.|`|aejmehZUaa	Same thing happened to me yesterday. As much as you hate him you want to talk to him? right? Well ill put it straight .. Hes not coming back. Delete everything that reminds you of him. Spend some time with your friends. Try your hardest not to speak to him or see him in person. If you want just spend a while having a big long cry so you get it off your chest and its good to cry then call up your friends and do something good. Your single now!  I know its hard but its got to be done sometime.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	-make a break-up box.

Sounds busy, but it works, lol. Oh yeah, start the next day with a great workout, because your so fabulous! :)
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	settling for this type of man has allot to do with your lack of self esteem, and how u view yourself. u would know if a man loves u and puts u first, and if he doesn't, u need to find a man who does. why would u keep trying with this man, when there are so many good men out there to pick from.if he loved u he would be there, its as simple as that.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Try retyping this question using real words instead of the ridiculous trashy abbreviations and you might actually find someone willing to read it!|`|csBvaXjiaa	I know you cant' be that dumb.  Where is your dignity?    Why would you want a man who has cheated on you numerous times and has even disrespected your mother and has no job or anything.    Drop this man like a hot potato....get you education and bone up on the spelling.     Work on raising your self-esteem so you won't let any man treat you in this manner again.
5xm6pS2Saa	Simply tell him that you have a boyfriend who you are perfectly happy with. Say that you like him as a friend and you never want to lose him as a friend. If he's a true friend, he'll understand you. Good luck! |`|58s8Ejwjaa	tell him that you like/love him but as a friend and its the gr8est feeling as well|`|orAWg1OKaa	OMG!!!!Ok I don't know ow old you are but I'm eleven ( please don't think that because I'm younger that I can 't be right but I'm pretty sure I am!!!) Well me and this boy ( Mark ) have been really good friends for three and a half years and constantly we have been asked are you boyfriend and girlfriend and we have said no. When Mark was on holiday we were texting each other almost every second then I slipped in a hint you are the best into one of my texts immediately he texted back saying thanks you two and then gradually he asked me out. i think what you should do is just tell him he is really cool and all that stuff, make sure you stay friends you never know when you might need him!!!!!!! Tell him or give a hint you know he fancies you and then hope he admits it if he does say that you are still dating that person but you and him can still be really good friends ( don't worry a real friend will understand!!! ) I hope I helped!!!  Catherine The St Trinian|`|vIXC0tfZaa	Ok well u told him that u have a bf so I don't think he likes to the point of going out. You should not think it is it falut so be happy.
wJ1v0cX0aa	i guess you will have to find a very very convincing reason to earn back his trust cause he is probably worried that the minute he will be with you and busy working, you'd crave attention and will cheat on him again.|`|HEkPGC4Zaa	yeah

jPJ9MTCwaa	Mine is next July and it is looking for the wedding day about $22,000.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I'm having 60 people and we are doing it for under $7,000! our budget was $8,000 but we have found so many ways to save money. It's still a BEAUTIFUL wedding and reception, just inexpensive. I'd rather spend the money on a nice long honeymoon travelling all over europe than a 1 day celebration.  I do want a nice wedding but I don't need to spend $20,000 to be happy with it. lol|`|LqyOHY37aa	About 12,000. That includes some short cuts like making our own invites but the food was awesome!|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	Im thinking around 2 to 5 grand.. Im not gonna go all out .. its my second time .. and I spent way to much the first time.|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	Mine will be under $1000 and held in THE most popular place for small weddings in MN (St. Paul Conservatory Sunken Gardens).  Reception will be at a local restaurant.  $1000 is as much as I would pay for a one day event.  I have better things to do with my money, although I don't knock someone who spends extra to get a caterer for a larger group of people.|`|ZVHq9GcLaa	Our budget was $10,000. We went about $2000 over because I bought two wedding dresses (yup i'm a shopaholic).  We had 99 guests.    My sisters cost her $10,000 too and she had over 400 guests!     So it really depends on how you spend your $$ and what type of wedding you want!|`|ItraCEBnaa	about 10,000.  ours was casual in our backyard.  we had about 150 ppl.  we used a caterer and the food was great!  premium open bar too (that never closed)!|`|JSK8tf9kaa	Around $12000.00   Twenty years later, the divorce costed $45000.00 plus alimony.|`|RgFTYvoIaa	I'm having mine next June, and it will be costing around $40,000+ my bridal ring set, and his engagement ring. I know I'll get a lot of thumbs down for this, but it's whatever because this is what I want. |`|czOYceqGaa	We had our wedding in the Summer. It cost us roughly around $15,000 for the wedding. Rings, hair, make-up, and wedding attire around another $6,000.|`|3VwquAraaa	Between $4,000 and $5,000.|`|8wuQSULlaa	I really wanted to keep my budget at $4000 or under, the more I look into things though I might need to bump it to $5000.     Just some info, according to statistics the average wedding costs $30,000.|`|8p31dENPaa	I'm not married or even engaged yet, but I will be soon. My mom and I have talked about paying for my wedding. We figured that if my mom, my dad, and my boyfriend and I come up with $5000 a peice then we will have 15,000 for a wedding, which is decent. Plus, if anyone else wants to contribute, then more power to them. I know my boyfriend would rather have a kick *** honeymoon over a huge wedding, so we won't have anything over the top, just a simple church wedding with family and friends. |`|ceumOjYqaa	Our wedding is in Australia in December and will be costing close to $20,000 AUD.    This will be for ceremony and reception at a boutique restaurant for 120 guests (110 of them are family) with an hour of pre-dinner drinks and a three course gourmet meal by the caterers who came second place in this years wedding catering awards (the people who won catered for my friends wedding earlier this year so we didn't want to go with the same caterer).     Our on site ceremony at our reception venue and the reception/catering due to the number of guests is costing $14,000 out of our budget.  This means that the cost for all our clothing, decoration, flowers, celebrant, photographer, cake, cars, rings, honeymoon etc only adds up to $6000 AUD which isn't expensive in the scheme of things. As far as Australian wedding that is... eg an average wedding dress in Australia is around the $1500 mark, a brides rose posy bouquet about $150, and suit hire for the men around $200 each - atleast the bit i'm from anyway! LOL|`|jXbLbJI9aa	havent had it yet (june 09) but roughly $10,000|`|zf559rY3aa	Mine is booked for next October, it is costing 16,000.|`|472jhEMsaa	i am getting married next october and we will spend about 20,000 when it is all said and done. the honeymoon will be almost 15,000. |`|ePVa9wb5aa	Around $15k|`|Xh4aSWHEaa	My wedding cost $18,000 and my sister's cost $20,000.  It wasn't terrible in the grand scheme of things, but it was a big wedding.  I think that's about a minimum for larger weddings.  Good luck to you!|`|o7lAXurcaa	Well we are having our wedding next year. Our reception hall alone costs us 25000$. Also, video photo is gonna cost 6500$. We are looking around roughly 40,000$. This does not include rings or honeymoon! i would love to have a wedding like some people that costs them 10,000. But my fiancee's family is very big, and we will have around 300-400 people. Sometimes you would like to spend less but unfortunately, there is something called respect, and it goes a long way for some people. You have to invite people that have invited you, your parents, to their events. So that's our situation!!  |`|eMGC1gLNaa	Well I'm planning  it to be less than $20000/- That is way too much. But I'm quite sure this will cost more than I expect. There will be atleast 300 - 400 people coming in. For safe threshold multiply your budget with 1.5 and keep that money in your account. So I have to come up with $35000/-  :(
9jB8tNwcaa	you situation is so sad.  i dont know if im jealous because ive never known that kind of love, or glad that ive never known that kind of love cause look what happens.      why do you have to give up on him?  the answer to that question is the reason why he isn't all that perfect, in fact.  you're dicknotized.  the effort you spend defending your unrequited love to a somehow undeserving but otherwise "perfect" man seems like you're mind ninja-ing yourself....beating yourself up...probably for his sins.  also, you probably aren't the type of person who would heed well the advice to become temporarily detached and let your heart mend itself while you invest yourself in yourself, doing things you always wanted to, and being alone for a while to discover who you are without a parasite attached.  it's not my pain, so i say unsympathetically, "get over it".  but seriously, i feel it's the best thing you could do, fall out of love right now and stop wasting time being alive while your young on a guy.  you've had your time to mourn your loss.  now celebrate your existence and be grateful damn it
8531e955441d7e3eea303141a099094daa	well....it depends...many things guys do r definitely for pleasing their GFs..........but they r nt sure about hw to please gurls..........once a guy is "very close" to u emotionally as well as physically,slapping ur butt may nt be a very significant act for him..............he may do it coz he wants to be playful with u.,........coz he really wants to reitirate tht he can touch u there where nt many will dare to touch...........and may be he is longing for u...but doesnt knw wht will be ur response ......so he will send signals like this..................|`|JvzPtji1aa	God this is gonna sound so white trash, but my b/f who is a marine is NEVER openly affectionate..    We were leaving Walmart(of all places) and I was wearing a cute pair of capris. As I pushed the cart out of the store, all I heard him say was was, "Mmm", and then SMACK. My booty hurt... But it was cute, when we got home, well you know...     Maybe it was a relief from the horrible PT he endured that day. WHo knows, but I was flattered, and shocked..    Its a good thing, trust me. :-)|`|2TBloievaa	Most of the time i would say that it the guy's way of saying he thinks you're sexy. As for the shy guy i have no idea but most likely its not intended to sexual or romantic.|`|gdAhrfOYaa	it is the appreciation of your butt. maybe its a good size.  whatever it is, don't take offense and take it as a compliment.|`|WhtjVvzUaa	Well if a guy (doesn't matter if he's shy) smacks a girl's butt, It means he has noticed his girls butt more attractive and more sexy than before...     well if chemistry works out well between you guys then it will lead to love making...     So enjoy its a good thing :)

Unfortunately those same women don't have much to offer.|`|7e8NN8saaa	Well I am not sure I agree completely - on the other hand it seems like American men want to stay children and not take on the responsibilities of manhood. Still there are some who do. Rare but not impossible to find if you look in the right places.     Never settle, darlin' NEVER.     And make yourself who you should be - if he loves you for that - he loves you - if not, well too bad for him.|`|kIy2bdiraa	I do get what you mean, and i have no idea.    ... but sometimes it's what you can't see that really matters.|`|29hcn9JRaa	This has been a on going problem that happens everywhere in the world, it is not just men, as their are plenty of females who are losers and have no desire to change, it is also not just men or women in the u.s, this happens in many different country's. People choose to either become successful with decent morals, or they choose to be losers then blame others for their failures, their is no one to blame except for themselves.|`|bGK3UPk7aa	I dont think thats true. Cuz.. There are still people that try. this is hate speech.|`|ixRkfLjIaa	Some people are just plain lazy.  There's no reason for a woman to be two bills.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I love those jars of oil that have the reeds sticking out to deodorize your house.  You can get them most anywhere these days and they make a pretty decoration in your house.  Probably cost about $10 each.  Probably a "teacher stuff" thing, but how about a dated tree ornament from Hallmark.  They usually have some cute original ones each year.  For about $20 you can get those sample perfumes at most department stores.  They have several scents by each manufacturer.  You could get each of them a Journal to keep track of their diet, daily stuff, and they can be personalized.  You could make each of them a matching scrap book of pictures you have of each other over the years.  It wouldn't have to be large.  People love homemade things and that would be very personal.    I probably could think of more, but maybe you can use one of these suggestions.    Merry Christmas and Happy Marriage.|`|5xm6pS2Saa	You could get a picture fo the four of you and put it in a nice frame. That would be nice. Get a nice frame with a sweet friendship quote on it. It would be a cute gift. |`|16c2CbFraa	One good thing that is a fairly reasonable price is a digital photo key chain. It is like digital photo frames but they are tiny and portable. They make a good gift. http://www.mypix.com/ds-150n-1-5-mini-di...|`|SgrjTkwdaa	1.  Christmas ornaments  2.  Do you have a group picture of all of you?  Put it in matching picture frames.  3.  just ran out of ideas...I'll add to this if I think of some more. |`|aJ1aaOi9aa	haha i love that "we hate teacher stuff!!" lol.  maybe you guys can mix it up this year..my friends and i usually do a "mystery gift" where we buy one gift, that way we can spend more rather than just buying cheap little things. and then have each person pick a bag and thats what they get and if they dont want it they can trade with another person.  OR  everyone puts a name in a hat and then you buy the gift for that one person, so you can spend more on them, and then when you get together you put the presents into a pile and find the one with your name on it and then once everyone has opened the gift you can say whos gift is from who.    --as for gift ideas you could buy cute christmas ornaments :) like pick out one for each of the girls that they may like and give a starbucks gift card with it or something    hope this helps :)

da4534e0616ae3b790821e67cdc420d9aa	RAQUEL.    Siendo varn, Estoy de acuerdo con tu apreciacin.    Vivimos en una Sociedad q arrastra con un predominio "machista". Tan fuerte, q muchas mujeres lo han aceptado como una LEY.    Mira la inequidad de juicios.    Si un hombre ha tenido muchas mujeres en su vida y actualmente sostiene amorios con varias simultaneamente, la sociedad lo acepta como vlido, sin crtica. Inclus en las damas crea un sentimiento de "CURIOSIDAD" y de "ATRACCION" por ese atributo q garantiza experiencia.  En contraparte si una mujer exhibe una conducta similar, la sociedad la "crucifica", la descalifica y la estigmatiza como mujer fcil, prdida  y ligera.. Siendo lo ms grave q sus peores FISCALES los fminas.   Presumiendo "ellas son las malas"  "yo soy la buena"    Dificilmente veras aqu preguntas donde un hombre diga :  "ese hombre es fcil", "hombres perdidos" , "hombres de vida ligera" .  Nuestro gnero es mas solidario o mas "alcahuete".    Urge q se organizen, cierren filas y firmen acuerdos de "no agresion"  al  gnero .    "POR LA EMANCIPACION  Y RESPETO INTERFEMINAS"    Un saludo RAQUEL|`|fGG1v0YPaa	totalmente de acuerdo con vos:las mujeres tendramos que ser como una hermandad,inseparable,pero vivimos peleandonos por hombres,trabajos,y pelotudeces.....nos serruchamos el piso unas a otras,y vivimos juzgndonos...un verdadero ASCO.|`|QhD4WnPHaa	Obvio, tan bien se necesita ms autocrtica de parte de los hombres.

Saludos Raquel.    =D|`|m722nsQLaa	Hola:    Yo no soy mujer pero creo saber a que te refieres.    No se trata de decir que deban o no ser mas solidarias entre ustedes, esta es una cuestion de genero y es parte de su naturaleza, te voy a decir por que:    Las mujeres son un ente emocional (aparte de ser muy orgullosas), mientras que el hombre es mas visual, por tanto  por mas que a uno le guste una chava, si ve que un amigo puede con ella, se hace a un lado y viceversa.     Ustedes no, asi sea el novio de la amiga, se lo quieren echar (bien porque les guste o bien porque es el novio de su amiga), es entonces cuando se recurre a cualquier metodo con tal de conseguir su objetivo. Y eso incluye descalificarse entre si.    Pueden intentar ser solidarias entre si, pero solo lo conseguiran dentro de un peque?o grupo, porque a las que no son de tu grupito, las vas a ver como enemigas.    Y no me digas que no, porque ese ejemplo se ve a diario y en todas partes.    Y si no, preguntanos a los hombres... cuando tienes novia, ella deja que siquiera le hables a sus "enemigas"????    Si o no?|`|168e6155ab83426860264e2ce51f490daa	No veo porque te tenes que sentir agredida como mujer   Yo como varon soy bastante fcil , las mujeres siempre me sacan un si|`|a18c580757237b953628474ac361909caa	Creo que la solidaridad empieza "por casa."   Haciendo lo que nos place y nos complace, sin necesidad de comportarnos como hombres.   Al momento de los placeres, nadie est "perdido" ni tiene una "vida ligera". Lo que es seguro, es que ambos gneros ?son fciles!  A m me importa tres ca**jos lo que digan u opinen los dems, sean mujeres o sean hombres. Solo me interesa lo que puedan opinar, quienes realmente me conocen, porque s que lo harn por y para mi bien.  ?Pedirle solidaridad a las mujeres para las mujeres? No lo creo. Igual va, el pedirle solidaridad a los hombres para los hombres.  ?Estamos cruzados! jajajaaaaaaaaaa  Cuando una mujer se siente atrada (para decirlo suavemente) por un hombre y es correspondida (aunque sea "de" la amiga), l es tan culpable y/o responsable como ella, de lo que est pasando y/o pudiera pasar.  Y si un hombre se siente atrado por la mujer "del" amigo y es correspondido, ?es lo mismo!  ?Qu queremos descubrir... la plvora?  La atraccin y la qumica entre dos personas, solo pueden ser frenadas por la razn, que en ese momento ?suele irse de vacaciones! jajajaaaaa  Y si logrs frenarlas, permanecen latentes. ?Qu ser peor?   ?Caramba! ?Qu hacer?   Lo que tu conciencia te dicte y te vislumbre como "seguir en paz con vos misma/o."  Al fin y al cabo, somos entes independientes y no pertenecemos a nadie, ni nadie nos pertenece.  Y ahora que me acuerdo (jajajaaaa) amiga... con tu otra pregunta y tu aclaracin "de que te arrinconen contra un omb" jajajaaaaaaa ?qu esperabas? jajajaaaaa  Muy buen fin de semana.  Un abrazo.|`|zniU9AaRaa	DANIEL TE AMA!!!  NO ENTIENDO A QUE SE REFIERE TU PREGUNTA???|`|J7Qh86F8aa	La verdad, no me top con ninguna pregunta as... pero qu quers que te diga...  Si un hombre se voltea 20, es un dolo, si lo hace una mujer,  ya sabs lo que es...  Ojo, no por eso fomento el tener relaciones con cualquiera, nada que ver... creo que cada uno es respon  sable de sus actos. Lo que me preocupa es que la juventud cree que todo est bien, que vale todo... y no aprenden ni a cuidarse ni a respetarse a s mismos... tanto hombres como mujeres...|`|d889a366b6aab16aece0adc4bb405cc9aa	No preguntan de mujeres malco porque no quieren ser autorreferenciales.|`|SnWvaSU0aa	Las culpas son de ambos y te digo por qu: una mujer queda mal parada cuando sale con varios a la vez, porque hay hombres que no son para nada discretos, y en su afan de vanagloriarse de conquistador, suele publicar sus andanzas como un logro personal. Esto hace que l salga como un campen y ella como una cualquiera, porque todo el mundo se entera, amn de que ciertas mujeres no saben discrecionar sus conquistas tampoco.  Por lo tanto, all ellas, y all ellos. Por eso para mi las personas no se miden por sus relaciones sentimentales, sino por el buen corazon que anime a cada uno, sea hombre o mujer.  No necesitas empezar ninguna campa?a para defender a nadie.  Cada cual se cava la tumba de acuerdo al tama?o de su propio cadaver.|`|pBSn4ODJaa	No te hagas la difcil, quers?

Todos ns temos defeitos, por que nossa melhor amiga tem que ser perfeita, honesta, sincera e outras qualidades mais?: N?o  bem assim que os relacionamentos funcionam, exitem motivos para agir com falsidade e interesse, s vezes ela tem problemas intimos que ningum at hj foi capaz de lhedar a m?o, ao inves disso, as pessoas que descobrem seus defeitos, jogam pedras e se afastam como se fosse anjos perfeitos. Ela  sua amiga e precisa de sua ajuda, estamos no mundo para isso, ao onves de juga-la e desfazer sua amizade pense bem antes, pois vc nunca ira encontrar uma amiga perfeita. Pense ninsso. Boa sorte.|`|yOLnb7xKaa	N?o fique triste, pois voc ir encontrar pessoas sinceras,foi bom voc  ter visto  como ela  falsa,para voc sair fora o mais rpido possvel, talvez sua vida n?o estava indo para frente por causa da inveja  dela.pessoas negativistas temos excluir de nossas vidas.temos que ter pessoas positivas, que nos levante,  abra?o, boa sorte!|`|vPBSpSmTaa	FOR?A, foi melhor voce descobrires, assim deixas logo de ser amiga de quem nunca foi sua amiga.`   pena e muito triste descobrires s agora, como dizem mais vale tarde do que nunca.|`|1szh550naa	pode ser que ela ate mesmo nao seja falsa desde a tenrra amizade.pode ser que tu percebeste mal.muitas das vezes nos os consideramos nossos amigos mas eles nao somos seus amigos.e importante saber se desde o principio da amizade era simplismente isso.nao confie em toda pessoa que talvez possamos dizer amigo.|`|a60553164680cc88b92c4ddcfe6f0aedaa	Menina, isso  muito ruim mesmo, isso aconteceu comigo quando eu tinha 13 anos e hoje estou com  26, ela apareceu namorando o rapaz a eu sempre gostei. Eu converso com a menina numa boa, mas nunca mais a considerei melhor amiga.   Eu tenho amizades, mas at confiar demora bastante e sempre vejo quando alguem esta com inveja de mim, portanto, sempre fico com um p atrs ao fazer novas amizades.  Perdoar faz bem pra saude, mas nao  precisa mais ser amiga dela.  Tome cuidado da proxima vez...|`|TwYLqbnbaa	independente da sua idade que eu nao sei, vc e todo mundo eh jovem o bastante pra conhecer novas pessoas e podem se tornarem otimas amigas. sei q vc cresceu c ela mais o importante e vc pensar q ela nao merece q vc fique triste e nem ao menos q vc escreva isso aki no yr... se valorize e plante e colhe os frutos da amizade daqui pra frente, e cultive-os c muito amor|`|1E1wEJP6aa	Oi amiga, e como di...!!!  Vc se decepcionou com uma amiga n...e eu q foi com minha irm? q era mais q uma amiga...!!!  Fiquei "malzona" amiga, e at hoje fico me perguntando como eu nunca percebi isso antes...? Ela sempre gostou de levar vantagem em tudo, mas nunca pensei q faria isso comigo... pq sempre confiei nela ao ponto de contar minha vida...sobre "meus amigos" sacou? E ela sendo casada, jamais me passou pela cabe?a q ela pudesse se "insinuar" p/ algum q eu estivesse tendo um relacionamento...mesmo q seja "virtual". foi isso q aconteceu amiga, mas ela nega at hoje...nunca admitiu , o q  pior, mas as "evidncias" foram mais fortes q as palavras dela...  Foi difcil pra mim, pq perdi a confian?a totalmente nela, e cortei qualquer tipo de relacionamento com ele...mas quem saiu perdendo nessa histria foram os dois...ela pq perdeu uma amiga...e ele pq perdeu algum q poderia ser muito mais q isso...sacou..?  Eu fiz o q aprendi com uma amiga Evanglica..."entrega pra JESUS e esquece..."  A fila anda amiga, e a mgoa faz mal pra quem sente... e ficar pensando muito nisso  dar importancia demais a quem n?o merece...!!!  Beij?o, e espero ter ajudado.|`|qccM9owCaa	Sim. Mas n?o mata ensina a viver...|`|MjE5Tz7naa	Pensa que melhor ter descoberto agora do que daqui a uns anos...e passar pra ela confidencias maiores e consequentemente ter uma decep??o maior.|`|BBeIsS8Kaa	Puxa vida, amiga, ent?o fique aqui conosco que ters muito conforto! Olha, isso j aconteceu muitas vezes comigo, e eu sei que di demais. Mas  preciso coragem e seguir em frente. Veja pelo lado positivo: agora tu sabes quem ela  de verdade. Essa ferida s o tempo pode curar, e novas amizades tambm ajudam, n!? Bjos pra ti e boa sorte!|`|txl0Xl7xaa	amiga eu ja passei por isso vc sabia que o Bush era meu amigo?agora ele virou as costa e esta ai atraz de mim falsao...nao esquente nao pq o mundo que vivemos  assim mesmo entao receba um beijo bomba bombom bem carinhoso|`|kE5Ee9Ycaa	realmente a decep??o di muito..Infelizmente existem muitas pessoas assim como a sua amiga..Mas sabe que mais,tenha for?a..Existir?o ptimas pessoas que a ajudaram

vPBSpSmTaa	O que estas a passar  um conflito de aceita??o e regei??o, amas o teu namorado e ao mesmo queres sair com outro cara. N?o fa?a isso se amas mesmo o teu namorado.  Ja rolou com o teu amigo basta se nao queres ter complica??es com o teu namo, deixe ele de fora leva a tua vida que deve ser melhor...  Boa sorte nada de precipita??o nao vai ser bom pra vcs.  BJKAS|`|81c8523f7f428049ef94d8d9995b11ccaa	Tor?o pra que ele esteja fazendo o mesmo com voce neh???  Se vc gosta tanto dele imagine ele com outra..que bom neh???  Voce gosta tanto dele que na 1 aoportunidade traiu...  que carter vc tem heim...|`|YWpUlKQoaa	Se vc realmente gosta do seu namorado vc vai conseguir se controlar e n?o trai-lo!!! Seu amigo uma hora vai desistir, n?o se preocupe!!!  Bjos|`|J8XT3IsFaa	n?o fa?a nada continue evitando o amigo uma hora ele te esquece!!!|`|DwePtd1haa	Ah.. agora t? entendendo...    Menina que confus?o hein? Essa decis?o s voc pode tomar. Voc ter que decidir entre o amor e o sexo. E pelo jeito o sexo com o amigo foi muito bom.    E com o namorado? Rola a mesma qumica?    Voc tem certeza que realmente gosta tanto assim do namorado? Ou est com medo de se envolver com o amigo que est em outra cidade e as coisas pra vcs ficariam bem mais difceis?    Ou rola esse lance do tes?o pelo amigo, pq ele t longe, ele  proibido?    Pense nisso, para de rotular: esse  pra namorar, esse  para transar. Pese o que mais importa pra vc numa rela??o. E com qual dos dois vc consegue ter uma rela??o mais completa. Ou de repente, n?o  nenhum dos dois...    Boa sorte!|`|kbxhNllAaa	Bom se fosse eu dava um tempo at voc decidir com quem voc quer ficar realmente. Voc tm que pensar e procurar entender seus sentimentos para n?o magoar ningum n?o tenha medo de ser sincera consigo mesma e nem com os outros. Tente entender e tome cuidado para n?o jogar fora um amor verdadeiro por uma tenta??o.    Beijos!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|b9b55c1ee73f95d2be713390fab7daeeaa	Aconteceu parecido comigo, mas eu estava no lugar do seu amigo e a minha amiga estava noiva, resumindo, insisti por mais de 1 ano e finalmente a levei para a cama mais 3 vezes, foi o suficiente para conseguir convenc-la a romper o noivado!  J somos grandes amigos a 8 anos, s vezes rola um sekisu casual, at hoje ela me agradece por t-la salvado de uma "furada"!|`|U7WA4CBFaa	Ah... Aquieta essa pirikita menina! Se voc ama mesmo o seu namorado, n?o tem com o que se preocupar com "tenta??es". Agora se voc n?o t aguentando... Mata a vontade logo e depois fique com o remorso da baixaria feita.|`|8pg2kkTFaa	Lia vc deve pensar muito antes de cair em tenta?ao!  aventuras ?nao vale a pena.se realmente gosta do seu namo,seja fiel.  desejo sorte.|`|LaPDK7Fnaa	Veja quem voc estar magoando, veja com quem vc quer realmente estar, pois quando estamos sozinhos, essas pessoas n?o surgem, e quando assumimos um relacionamento elas aparecem, mas elas aparecem e podem n?o permanecer, avalie isso, esse seu amigo, porque n?o deu certo da primeira vez?? ser que dar certo agora?? n?o se deixe enganar pela vaidade, acabamos perdendo pessoas importantes por perder a raz?o do que  mais importante...|`|IoSA2ZXNaa	Ent?o evite ler as mensagens ou vc pode tbm mudar o chip do celular ,excluir do msn ou n?o atender as liga??es dele   se vc tiver orkut exclui-lo
DVB7P2Ysaa	s perguntando para ele.|`|DwePtd1haa	Bom... se rolou no primeiro encontro,  pq a quimica entre vcs foi grande.  Se ele est te procurando  pq quer conversar, se encontrar... Saber o que ele realmente quer s falando com ele. Jogo aberto. Se vc teve a liberdade de transar com ele logo de cara, porque o tes?o falou mais alto, n?o tem pq ter medo de uma segunda conversa e ver qual  a real.  De repente, a idia inicial dele era uma ficada, mais ele pode ter gostado tanto que quer algo mais.  Concordo com  o rapaz que respondeu que fazer sexo  uma coisa e amor  outra.   Vai em frente e veja o que ele quer e se vc tambm quer.  Se o start do relacionamento foi o sexo bom, quem sabe n?o evolui para algo mais?  Boa sorte!|`|fsJgBbTNaa	 difcil saber.. tem q encontrar com ele denovo pra saber como vai se comportar ... Mais acho q gostou sim.|`|Z4HB8c1Taa	passa amanh?|`|LaPDK7Fnaa	normalmente a maioria dos homens querem s sexo, e quanto mais novo essa afirma??o fica mais verdadeira, f facil descobrir quais as reais inten??es dele, se voc n?o o conhece a muito tempo ele quer sair com vc, descubra aonde ele quer te levar, isso  um forte indicio de suas reais inten??es, e verifique se ele teve outras experiencias, pois pelo que percebi, ele deve ou era virgem...|`|GA9akjljaa	Corajosa voc,deixar rolar no 1 dia!  agora se eles t atrs de voc e disse isso na hora h  pode existir sentimento de parte dele,agora se n?o quer se envolver corte logo!  melhor do que fazer ele sofrer!    Boa sorte!|`|TAx0XAfPaa	Prezada,    Dei muita risada com a sua pergunta, mas vou tentar responder com a vis?o masculina.    O fato de ter rolado algo na primeira, vez nada interfere na ideia que ele v ter de vc, pois isso vai muito da cabe?a do cara.  Agora, o fato dele ter perguntado se vcs estavam fazendo sexo, talvez seja porque ele estivesse fazendo amor, algo muito maior e mais complexo.    Amor na primeira vez  algo complicado, mas pode acontecer.    Uma coisa eu posso te afirmar, para esse cara estar te ligandop direto  a prova de que vc trabalhou certinho.    Boa sorte    beijos|`|vPBSpSmTaa	Amiga!!!  A primeira a saber isso devia ser vc, mas vou tentar explicar em pequenos detalhes segundo a minha experiencia masculina.  concerteza ele esta querendo provar a si mesmo se vc estas a fim de mais um... e por outro vc precisa ter em mente que o facto de ter rolado logo no primeiro dia e ele estar a ligar e mandar msg nao quer dizer que gostou de vc se calhar gostou  de transar com vc e que mais outra chance  nao permita se asssim for de um chute nele.  mas se for o contrario va em frente...
ETL9hDIBaa	To be completely honest, I don't like any of them.  When I tried on a dress with a skirt like those, my friend (who I trust with my life) told me I looked like a melting cupcake.  After looking at the pictures of the dresses I tried on, I agreed.  I preferred A-Line empire waisted dresses.  But that is my personal opinion.  If you like them, you should try them on to see which one looks good on.  |`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  I love the first one.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	One or four. Say no to the curtain-skirts!|`|Ghts0pt4aa	2 and 3rd one   |`|HiSVA9p8aa	They are all lovely except the fourth.  That one would make a flag pole look overly hippy.    I'm particularly drawn to the first.  Maybe it's just that the photo shows the dress off so well, maybe it IS the dress.|`|kHEFi3ttaa	I love the first one. It's such a pretty dress. Have you gotten the chance to try that one on? I think it'd really compliment your features.    Good Luck and Congratulations |`|QMxEjCpiaa	The best advice I can give you, is go and try every style on. I searched and searched for mine and finally came upon it when I was tired and ready to stop. The dresses you are picking at going to be at least $1,000 and up ... save the money on the dress and spend it on really nice flowers or a honeymoon. Weddings don't need to cost $20,000+ for it to be beautiful.|`|Y8fHrVCHaa	i think you should go try some on!! i had the most perfect dress in mind when i went to try dresses on and then would you believe i picked a dress i never imagined that i would ever have picked its wierd. dresses will look different on you then they do in pics and its so much fun tryin them on!! something that you never thought would look good in you might flatter your figure more than any of the pics!! i am sure whatever you pick will be beautiful on you and your soon to be husband will think you look amazing that day!! congrats|`|pcQi36h7aa	So weird o.O    I'm 22, 135, 36C, and... I'm getting married in may too!!(23rd) I'm 5'2" though, lucky you LoL    For me, I chose one with spaghetti straps, corset style bodice, and has a v/sweetheart neckline. It's very flattering to my shape and figure ^_^ My veil(going by the associates advise) is 2 tierd and kind of plain because my dress has so much detail to it.    I'm not a big fan of strapless though, because I always thought it made the bride look top heavy or "bare," but if you found the right necklace(like nice pearls), it would look great.      I would have to go with the First Choice ^_^  Congratulations!!!|`|VQCKjEacaa	3rd one!|`|57cb25c60b8d0c2059928269b9b6ec6faa	I LOVE the first one!!! My second choice would be the last one!  Congrats and good luck|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	i'm not really into the princess wedding gown thing, but i do like the 4th one. it's simple, classy and would be flattering to most figures.     congrats and good luck!|`|CSjBv9JEaa	i LOVE the first one with cinderella ALOT! :D|`|0sHarzeZaa	famous wedding photographer, Daniel Colegrove says the first one. That's the one I like best too.  http://www.dcolegrovephotography.com|`|bxA9ZfYVaa	They are all gorgeous! I think my fav is  1 though. Good luck!|`|DFAS6jRRaa	i like the 3rd one|`|63958e667c2a30b47447dff834423993aa	Not liking any of them...none of them are the perfect dress.  I kind of like number 1 but the waist sash part just looks a bit off to me.  The third one is nice but I don't like the pointy part on the top of the bust.  The last, additional one, is nice but is also looks a bit off with the skirt...     I didn't like the others at all...keep looking...that right dress will pop out at you!    http://www.alfredangelo.com/Collections/...    http://www.alfredangelo.com/Collections/...    http://www.alfredangelo.com/Collections/...|`|XlOZRYWwaa	I LOOOOOVE the first one. I wore this one from davids bridal and loved it.  http://www.davidsbridal.com/bridal_gowns...  A line dresses go great with small frames. I say the first dress! Winnie Couture has beautiful dresses.  Good luck!|`|EQsS470Haa	I like the first one the most|`|8hqTO4IFaa	i love love love the first and the third dress.|`|h5zJh195aa	I love the first one|`|o7lAXurcaa	We have almost the same taste...except for the last one...that one i didn't like. The Jim Hejlm is my DREAM DRESS..but unfortunately i don't have 3200$ to spend on it!! I WISHHHHHHHHHH!! i tried it on and left my heart in that store! i also love the Alita Graham one but i think it's too plain! The cinderella one is also very nice!! with your height and weight anything will look good..But the last one...i really didn't like it!! anyway good luck and congrats

fHfVRcqbaa	Okay, first of all, if anyone is going to do the returning of gifts or talking to them, it should be your husband.  Anything you do will be perceived as "Your fault" from here on out, even if you reconcile with your husband's family.  Talk to hubby, see what he wants to do, and if he wants to call them and tell them no more gifts, so be it.  If not, keep taking them to the thrift store or donating them to charity.  Bottom line, don't do it on your own.  It has to be HIM and not you.|`|94b8KImYaa	Good that the 2 of you are sticking together on this. If, then your husband should tell his parents that they need to stop sending anything.   If it bothers him, when gifts and cards arrive - and he wants that - how about you return them to sender immediately. Maybe then the message is clear.   If your husband does not want to deal with his parents - you can not make peace there.     Good luck|`|8txWayVnaa	They are your husband's parents, and you should respect his wishes.  Write them a letter re-explaining your position that unless and until they apologize, they will have no active part in your lives.    As far as the cards and gifts--return them upopened with a brief note asking her not to send you anything else.  If she continues to send things, just keep sending them back unopened.  She'll get the hint.|`|QXRrJPHqaa	I would be polite with them when they contact you, but if they are stubborn enough not to control themselves as you have asked, then they are un-deserving of a relationship with both of you, and its disgusting that they made him feel guilty about his grandpa --- i would avoid them at all costs just for that.  I wouldnt bother with them, and i think youre doing the right thing for both of you to avoid people like that and its nobody fault but their own. you are married and your life is none of their business to judge.|`|AA12240972	My advice to you is butt out. Your husband has made his decision why would you betray him by responding to them?  Accept nothing and have no contact and for Christ's sake be loyal to your husband.

Not hot at all.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	Eff No.        yuuckkkk|`|8bq6S19Oaa	Not really, when people smoke, to me it just looks like they're *trying* to act "cool", "badass", "hot" etc... So yeah, to answer your question, even the hottest guy in the world, couldn't make smoking look hot.
AA11113523	if you guys dont talk much, it mite be kinda weird to ask her out.  maybe u should ask her for her number and text her or call or sometime. or invite her to a group outing and make sure u spend a lot of time talking to her, see if shes into you. maybe add her myspace, if she has one, and talk to her there.  if things go well after you guys start talking, than yah ask her out!  you could simply pull her aside wen u see her and aks her out. or ask her out wen ur out doing something together with a couple of friends. but its better if you do it in private.

Lol.|`|fTxHlGAmaa	Well its tradition really , its a vow of eternal love but sometimes your to tired becauseof the wedding itself :D i think i'll wait till my honeymoon :) may be just a little bit of fun on the first night :) |`|94mqNB4jaa	i think they do its lik consumating they used to do that in tudor times. If they diddent comsumate the marrage they could get a divorce the next day! so yeah most people do unless there too tired|`|FFS0YFZIaa	im not married but would probably be too drunk, i think id have to wait until the next day. |`|vm55Maitaa	Yea, or that'd be one boring honeymoon.|`|uk9823b6aa	before, during and after, all night all day.

I know its tradition but you have the rest of your lifes so one night off's not going to kill you.

If you have lived together and "consumated" before hand, then you don't want to cut short the best party of your life for something you've had before.    If it's the first time, well, then hell yes, it's the most important thing of the night!    When we got married, we had lived together before hand.  We did consumate the marriage, but we were both rather tipsy,.....|`|eG6brYYJaa	uhm, yeah. wouldnt YOU think so?!|`|Cho46Re0aa	As a man  I can say I was too tired  and Knackered   .

I am really hoping we will, but I have a feeling that I will be too tired. |`|dDdkYpDzaa	Ha, you think all married couples do, but I've known 3 that didn't until several nights later.  They were all virgins (man and woman) and one was too tired to go into something so emotional, one was too unknowlegable and didn't know what to do.  One was just too emotional from the wedding and she wouldn't start crying -so he didn't want to make her more upset.    I did, but I wasn't a virgin anyway.|`|PxdzF9Bzaa	Yes we did.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	We tried. We were both too drunk after spending the evening in the hotel lobby bar after the reception.

7cc75a6aefffb4209e43185e444a41fdaa	Oui, je suppose ... Enfin, cela dpend des dfinitions qu'on donne  ces termes, mais tels que je les entends, ?a ne me para?t pas incompatible ...    La perversit,  mon sens, consiste  bousculer et rcrire le droulement normal des choses, voire  braver les interdits moraux pour dvoyer ce qui est habituel ...    Cependant, "fleur bleue" (et je te sais gr d'utiliser ce terme, l o de nombreux autres utilisent "romantique"), c'est apprcier de courtiser ou d'tre courtiser, c'est prendre le temps de go?ter les attentions de l'autre, c'est ce jeu de oui et de non qui fait le charme de la sduction ...    La perversit n'est pas  l'oppos de cela ... Et la fleur bleue peut y gagner  avoir quelques pines, pourvu que ces cueils soient suffisamment baliss pour ne pas mettre son partenaire en difficult ...     Une perversit partage et consentie par les deux partenaires n'empche en rien un esprit galant sans faille, pourvu qu'elle soit identifie et que chacun sache ce que la perversit n'a pas le droit de toucher, notamment le respect de l'autre ...    Reste  dfinir "en mme temps", et c'est peut-tre par cela que j'aurais d? commencer : non, pas en mme temps, car c'est dans ce cas qu'ils s'opposent, l'un voulant le respect d'une tradition et l'autre le niant ... Mais que l'un prenne le dessus sur l'autre ou inversement, et le moment  deux devient plus exaltant ...    En tout tat de cause, ne jamais oublier que la perversit est un jeu d'quipe, pas un sport individuel ...|`|WgUafhfpaa	?a commence par schi    ?a finit par    frnie et entre les deux il y a salope|`|b79ff9ac264b4218722bb784d4b691aeaa	moi j'aime bien les fleurs bleue, les roses aussi, mais pas les oranges. biz|`|ehia3pwYaa	tout est possible dans ce vaste monde !                hlas...|`|c60418f409a291f66924f05515bb9869aa	Intrigante... bien s?r que c'est possible !

Dn8i9sIlaa	edit: I can understand why you are upset, it is hard to see anyone you love go through such negative changes, even if they are only physical. But is your relationship not based on anything more than just appearance?      She's the same girl inside, maybe she is depressed and does not have any motivation. She's not spitting in your face, I doubt that the weight gain has anything to do with you at all. If you were going through a rough period and ended up putting on weight and becoming unmotivated, if she just left you without even trying to understand what was going on you'd feel pretty jilted wouldn't you?  Why don't you ask her if she'll exercise with you? Maybe if you're encouraging and not accusatory she'll be more motivated to look after herself. Ask her if anything has been bothering her lately, and maybe you will find the root of the problem.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Move on before your hooked to the ball- n- chain !|`|AA10339249	While people may say you seem kind of shallow, this could be a sign of other problems more pressing than just her weight. The happiness of both of you could be at stake. Maybe she's depressed, or on the other hand, maybe you made her so comfortable at first she thought things were cool, but then she lost control of her weight, and lacks the drive it takes to control it.     One thing is for sure; the more negative attention you give her for this, the less likely she is to do anything about it. First, make sure that you yourself are in great shape. Then don't say anything about it, be patient, and hopefully she will come around. She really needs to get in better shape for her own health, after all. That is the important thing.     If things don't work out after awhile, then maybe you need to move on. But either way, the question you want to ask yourself is, do you want her to remember you as an immature guy bugging her about her weight, or a nice guy who gave her a chance?|`|GrtqaUInaa	Either she doesn't really care anymore or she may be depressed or under stress. Its really REALLY hard to stop eating and she's probably in the habit of eating a lot. Give her a break. I see where you're coming from...but maybe you should end this relationship if you cant put up with her.  Or get her help.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	First of all, it's not healthy to put on that much weight.. and it puts her at a much greater risk for type 2 diabetes and other health problems. However, it seems to me that you are only concerned about her physical appearance.     Weight is a very personal issue with women.. it's very touchy. If my husband said "you know, all you have to do is pick up a weight every now and then," I'd probably smack him. You need to let her know that you have a genuine concern for her health.     Find out the reason behind her weight gain. It could be a thyroid problem, or it could be from overeating. Regardless, she needs your help. You can't just tell her to do it and not support her. Try working out with her or doing active things with her like hiking or biking. Have you gained any weight? Maybe she feels the same about you, so she has given up. Or maybe she's just comfortable with you and feels like she has you. That tends to be the case a lot of the time.|`|mNjjSPdVaa	I can well understand your plight, when you put more effort into helping someone than they do themselves, it can be very frustrating.  But keep in mind that this goes much deeper than that.  Whatever it is that's bothering her enough to keep "feeding", needs to be dealt with, by her, before she can start to actually lose weight.  She's hiding from something behind food.  I don't think you should take it as she's spitting in your face, she just needs a little extra love so that she can deal with whatever it is that's bothering her.  She may not even know what that is.    I help people every day with weight problems and have found that encouragement and love win over every time!|`|KOXcw4klaa	it sounds like a case of i have him now so i don't care any more.this is a classic case of reel him in and hope he stays.you both need to talk this over.if things don't change,well its time for a change.|`|AA10377289	good she only your gf.. boy, its all about motivation. if you love her youll motivate her more.. see it as a challenge. not only for you but for her health.. if she consistently stays stubborn, leave her sorry @$s and find one that would appreciate you more than her. she not the only fish in the see... see if that wont wake her up|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	I also have no patience for fat people.   Being fat is a choice.      Yes, being fat is linked to low self-esteem, or self-hatred, but that is their problem, NOT MINE !      Stop eating, or I am outta here !      It really sucks in the dating world too, because it is nearly impossible to find an available 'healthy woman'.    EDIT  According to how I read the story, Miss S is male.|`|xZo4wP6Faa	Break up with her. I'm sure your feelings on this aren't healthy for either of you. Maybe she is sad or even depressed. Whatever it is, your being unhappy about it (not to mention angry, which is also how you sound) is not going to make it any better. If you're so concerned with appearance, hey, whatever. I'm not going to bash on you for it. But you need to be with someone who is on that level as well.|`|jPten0Fraa	Dude, i dont know much about women, but imo (in my opinion) you should stick with her. if it was her looks that drove u to her, than maybe its time to leave, but if u fell in love with her personality, looks shouldn't matter. i dont at all think you're a shallow jerk at all   hope this helps|`|SHARt1k3aa	I don't think it's shallow at all.  I mean, it's one thing if someone has a baby, puts on some weight, then yeah, that would be shallow.  But, if you met this girl and you were attracted to her because of the way she looked, then packed on 50lbs, that would be something to consider.  I mean, people can sit there and call you shallow, but they most likely would think the same way!  I'm a woman, and I take care of myself, I find that if you just let yourself gain 50 lbs, you really aren't taking care of yourself, or like you said, even caring.  But, just like any other addiction, she has to be the one ready to live a different life Style and eat differently, and work out and do all the things it will take to lose 50lbs. God, that's a lot, what the helll is she eating.  Also, help out by cooking some healthy meals, or signing both of you up for the gym.|`|0vYE2BpZaa	Don't listen to anyone that says you're shallow for feeling this way. Unless there's a medical problem, she IS disrespecting you by not taking care of herself. Just as you would be disrespecting her if you jumped up 50+ pounds.     Whether women like to admit it or not, you generally make a pact when you get married. That pact consists of the idea that you will only have sex with your spouse. Physical attraction is a part of sex. So, when she does something drastic that makes her no longer attractive, she's telling you that she doesn't care if you're attracted to her - you're stuck with it.     If she doesn't care about your happiness enough to slim down, she doesn't care about you.     Now, there is a difference between 25-30 pounds and 50+. Everyone can move up and down the scale. If she moves up and down a few pounds, that's one thing. Disrespecting you by gaining a true 50+ pounds is another.     Personally, I would tell my wife (and she knows I feel this way) that if she gained that much weight our contract would be broken and I would feel free to find someone that looks attractive. If she doesn't want the job, I can find someone that does.    Putting on that much weight in that short a period of time shows a lack of character and pride.     Now, the other side is, why doesn't she care enough about you to stay slim? You need to get to that issue. Does she still love you? Is she depressed? She might need some help. There IS an issue there, and you should get to the bottom of it. You will never get her to stop this behavior unless you get to its root. You need to talk with her, not about her weight, but about what's really bothering her. She may have a real concern, or she might not - either way, you need to deal with it.

Good luck!
Pn6aqpulaa	I have been in the lifestyle for 25 years and have found that first of all you have to start slow.  If he is being a little shy about taking control start off playfull, take him to an adult store and shop for toys or leave a cute whip or pair of fluffy handcuffs on his pillow.  If he knows your past he needs to know this is not you re-living some horror but making a wonderful new memory.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	It's a fine line, but you have to have a safe word.  The safe word will be used when he get to rough, and will let him know that it is time to stop.  I would try roll playing the idea with him first and see if it interest him.  Sometimes the hardest part is finding the right individual that meets your needs.  If he is submissive, you may need to bring in an outside source, someone to dominate you both.  Just try with each other and hopefully you will find the right amount of pleasure to give you the desired effects.  Good luck.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	First be very careful, there is a very fine line between being dominate and being abusive.  If you try to make someone dominate that is not naturally that way or if his love and respect for you is not strong enough he will either utterly fail or just become abusive.  BE VERY CAREFUL!   The problem you may be having is that he may secretly be a sub too.

AA11113523	the question is, do u still want to be friends with her?  if you dont necessarily care, the easiest way to do it is simply by ignoring her. dont answer her calls, dont reply to her texts, if she tries to talk to u in person, make up some lame excuse. she will eventually get the hint.    if you do want to be friends with her, that gets a lil tricky.  you are going to have to let her down gently by saying somethign like " Im sorry but i really dont like you like that anymore and i have moved on to other girls, but i hope we can still be friends". chances r, if she likes u, she will be ur friend in hopes of getting close to you.|`|qTm7WV6Taa	dont answer her  she'll get the point after a while  it may sound mean but its the truth  it happened to me.|`|9GMk5u5Naa	just tell her the relationship was a mistake|`|ihzJyIYqaa	you have to tell her straight out you dont like her. tell her youve moved on and she should do the same because if she holds on to you she'll never find someone else. and tell her u want to be friends but shes creeping you out, and thats not how friends act

But when it comes time to seriously settle down, they do not find themselves identifying with non-Black women.  The experience of being Black in America is a very unique one.  So while you may hear of Black men dating non-Black women, they may not marry them. Sometimes it just doesn't work out.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Why do people make any broad claims about any group of people?

I assume you are American ? In your country there are cohesive black communities, some find their mate wherever, but most shop at home. In Germany we have few blacks (we missed our chance to stock up on them o.O ) so black people cant form communities revolving around blacks, they need to get along with zhe Germans and the other foreigners.|`|fMDS4vTGaa	The myth of the black man seducing the white woman goes all the back to slave times when black men were seen as a threat on the plantation.  In the early south the majority of residents were actually black people -- slaves, so the the hold that whites had over their black captors was often tenuous at best, which required strong social myths and cultural limitations to keep "mingling" in check.  Hence the myth of the sexually threatening black man.    Also, couple this with the fact that contrary to myth of white society, blacks were not actually happy captives.  Many a white plantation owner feared the intelligent outwitting on the part of their slaves on a daily basis, couple that with the white man being matched by strength by the black man and myths were generated out of outright fear and stories of rebellion here and there.    Many whites comforted themselves by cultivating the ideal of their superiority of black folk, one being the idea that black people aspired to be white, by marriage or other markers of success.      Old myths and cultural markers die hard.  It seems racism is so intrenched in this society that it will take many more generations to wrestle out the old demons, such as the myth you describe.|`|vcZZvtXAaa	And the significance of this question is???? Why would you care who marries who..wow and wiki is your source LOL|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Well considering that blacks account for only about 10% of the US population, that is a lot.

That is immature and shows that you are insecure. The best thing to do is just ask him if there is potential for you two right now. And if anything serious will become of it. You said he was shy so maybe he's wondering the same exact thing. Good luck girl!!|`|Pw5VSLDiaa	ask him,, dunno what else to say..if he is super shy thats prob y he aint said anything... but its obvious that he really likes you...
6NbFy1KPaa	Tell her that you have the perfect foot massage technique.  Explain that there are pressure points on the foot that can cause great sense of comfort and relaxation if pressure is applied properly.  Offer to show her.
6NbFy1KPaa	Leave that smug obnoxious B***h alone.  Beauty is more than skin deep.  Beauty is a reflection of a person's soul and character and anyone who has balls enough to tell someone that they are not "good looking" enough for them is just a pig.  Forget her.  Don't cast your pearls amongst the swine.

u5RlhfF6aa	Lindsey, this is one of the most troubling dilemmas in a young persons life. I know... I'm a young person. And I'm in the same situation.    First, just talk to him. Discuss whatever, while staying yourself, and not getting too nervous. You are friends... he's not going to know instantly if you pop a strange question.  (make sure you have plenty of time to talk - at lunch, before a class, a free period, whatever. That is, if you're in school :)    Pop jokes in the conversation about whatever you're talking about. Make him laugh. This is HUGE rapport.    I dunno about most guys, but I always dreamed of catching the girl I liked staring at me. Another one is her joking about other people's dates, then when she asks who I like, she just casually places her hand on mine and sees how I react.    I HAVE NO IDEA about girls minds, but I'm just tossing ideas around. Have fun with it, I guess.|`|p4ijP6ojaa	everyone is sooo perverted... that is NOT KOOL! way wrong way to go! ok so i think it is super more BETTER when the guy asks the gurl but i think you have to drop the hint BUT most of the time, they are just weird and can sense that kind of stuff you have going on sooo my best advice is JUST BE YOURSELF and DONT SHOW YOUR BOOOBS!!!!|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Two ways of charming a guy, First off you can try to cook him a meal that would leave him forgetting his mother's cooking.  The other way to charm this guy is to just put it on him and see what happens from there. If you do it just right, you and him will have the time of your lives.  If not, no big loss there are bigger and better fish in the sea.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	I can only give you my point of view, but nothing appeals to me more than a lady who is truly feminine.  We blur the lines of what is male and female so much, but I don't think that has stopped us from being strongly attracted to the qualities that we don't have.    So, don't overdo it with notes and phone calls and make him run away.  But do the things that guys love - be supportive of him.  Listen to him.  Kid him a lot, like tell him that you think your stronger than him and that your better than him at his favorite, and play video games better.  And when he makes a joke, punch him in the arm - guys love that!    Of course, these things have to be in your natural personality.  I guess what I'm saying is to encourage your femininity.|`|uVH046Fjaa	Flash him. It's very charming.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	Show him your boobs. That is THE way to charm a guy.     On the other hand, you could just talk to him and tell him how you feel, but if you want him to literally be charmed like a snake, then the boob thing is the way to go.|`|AA10240928	Just go along as usual.  Then go do stuff when it's just you and him.  Movies, shopping, hanging out, whatever.  Look him in the eye and smile a little more.  If he likes you, it will happen.  It's nature and harmones so don't worry about him getting the hint.  Guys can't help but sense this stuff through smell or something.  This would be the slow and safe route.    Or you could just grab his junk and bite him.  This works too.|`|xEJm0NCiaa	what hippie said, lmao (thumbs up) :P|`|JXpU6ro4aa	ask him to hand out sometime|`|zMCpXmivaa	u can charm the dude by hanging out with him and sending off little tips that show u wanna take it a step further. if ur good friends, try not to do something too perverted|`|upsx2BInaa	i flirt nd talk nd just b nice. i also sumtimes give compliments|`|RrzfZP8laa	why does everyone think that boobs is the way to go?? i think that'll just freak him out like if you just pull up your shirt randomly. haha!  anyways, letsee, i think it should just flow when you talk to him. do you feel like a connection or a click? and you guys can like talk for hours? then thats a good sign. really, like everyone already said, just be yourself, cause if you are someone else to make him like you, he'll like you for the wrong reasons. but again, it doesnt hurt to stand out a little around him. be loud, be crazy, be cute!  just remember to be yourself! :] goodluck!|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	organize group outings. not just the 2 of you, but a whole bunch of mutual friends just to hang out at someones house or the mall or something..then when your with them, try to be near him. talk to him, sit beside him, flirt with him, cuddle if your just chilling on the couch or something etc...lol i did that w/ my current bf and it worked very well because when our friends left he asked me out     goodluck|`|e01b865c0771c47a4d22d3a9ad54d2efaa	Im going to answer this another way instead of the stripper and flashing thing, which is fine later in the relationship. Anyway, always be interested in what he is talking about and don't interrupt when he's talking. Be a lady but don't be to prim and proper. Act mysterious and don't tell him evey detail of yourself. Let him come after you. It works, then once you have him strip for him and keep him around. Good Luck!|`|0MZChtWqaa	be kind and every thing then next time you talk to him talk about your life and intrests then when you get all mushy gushy he will kiss you and then youll get into it trust me it works|`|U1e7wJgYaa	be yourself if he likes u hell go for your charming|`|2AacsOObaa	Being yourself is always a good idea.|`|zWFsgPyMaa	by pulling up your shirt and not wearing a bra|`|ZR25pTOYaa	only be you.|`|V54eDkMaaa	show him the goods
253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Basically, you are an enabler. You are helping her by making it easy for her to be irresponsible with her money. I would do everything to help the child. Tell her if she can't afford to pay for the child, you will take custody and do it, or that she can learn to live on a level she can afford. Also, don't give her cash. Pay with checks and make note of what she said the money is for. This will help you when the two of you do finally go to court.|`|kpg623Gwaa	Document everything that you give her!!!  Including her excessive lifestyle.  Believe me when she gets to court she will cry Poverty and the Judge will have your last pair of underwear delivered to her via UPS.  Provide for your child.  Offer to take the child if she cries about not being able to pay the rent.    Keep all receipts and never talk bad about her in front of the child or a judge.    My first reaction was to put your wallet in a plastic bag and hide it in the freezer, but then I know you don't want your child to suffer and that is the main reason you give her money for her rent.    Do what your heart tells you and keep those receipts.  Peace|`|f6YsGOynaa	No...and while you're at it, fight for custody for your toddler.  If your ex is jetsetting, partying, and can't live within her means, what kind of example does that set for your little one?|`|AA11538662	Nope, I would not. If you have to make financial sacrifices so should she. Besides, she's the one that wants out. Let her figure it out on her own. Only pay the agreed child support and if there is no court order for this, maybe it's time to file for the divorce.    Mary in Camden, MI|`|AA11755944	give her what you are ordered to do.|`|rze9GJtEaa	no don't give her jack. Go to court and file for child support order so you are not over paying and you can show you have been paying child support before she goes and claims you haven't paid her jack and have to pay back child support.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	You need to tell your lawyer you and your ex need something in writing stating the amount you owe her per month for child support.     Or else your ex is going to take advantage of your kindness, then turn around and tell the court that you should be able to give her $1500 a month for support, since you've been giving her that already for her rent.    Don't allow her to move in with you.  It will only create more problems for you, and a false sense of security for the child.    Plus, women don't want to date men that are living with another woman, especially an ex.|`|gSBco9oaaa	Child support is based on what you make, and is intended to afford your child a similar lifestyle to the one you enjoy. It is simply a fact of life that your ex will 'benefit' as well, as she is the one with physical custody.    The only precedent you need to worry about setting in the court's eyes is the one that shows you are doing everything in the best interest of your child. Check your state's guidelines for support, give her that, and nothing else. I would also show her this info, and perhaps the two of you will be able to come to agreed upon terms on all the issues. Explain carefully that this is what you are able, willing and legally required to do, and you will do nothing more. If she tries to use your child as a weapon, as in, your child will not have food, clothes, etc., make sure you document that threat. Then, go out and buy whatever your child needs, keep it (food) at your house and let her know you have it for your child.If she does not cooperate, and you have it documented, even in just a diary or calendar, her refusal to do so will cast her in a poor light with the court.     On the other hand, if you are upset because you are giving her x amount of dollars and you think she shouldn't be allowed to use 'your' money for herself, you are barking up the wrong tree, as long as your child's needs are met. There is a fine and fuzzy line here, and you need to be very careful that you do not cross it, or even appear to cross it in the eyes of the law. She could charge that you are attempting to control her and punish her and using your money/support as a tool. That would not be good for you, or for your child.    Keep in mind that what you do now will set the tone for your relationship with this woman for many years to come. No matter how hard it is now, it could be worse, and if handled wrong now, will be worse. She walked away. Forget it. Move on. Do what is best for your child, first and always, and eventually, you will reap the rewards. A good relationship with your child, which is, afterall, all that counts.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	give her NOTHING except what the court order says.    Forget her and her crying, mamby-pamby butt! she IS USING YOU with the 'crying female helpless give-me-some-money routine.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	How about saying - NO.  If she can't support herself and your child than perhaps you should be going for full custody...|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Keep your money.  You don't want to set a precedent where a Judge might mistake your generosity for an ability to pay her alimony and/or an obscene amount of child support.
CoOd51qQaa	yeah tell her you just wanna be friends. or tell her your too busy right now for a girlfriend. oh but beware of her brother. he might beat the crap out of you if she wants him to so be as nice as possible.     but maybe you should give her a chance. dont judge her so quickly because of the people she hangs with. just wait like a week or 2 and if your feelings still havent changed, dump her.|`|U4OlL1M3aa	tell her that you just wanna be friends, say its not that your pretty cause you are i just don't think this would work at all and i hope we can still be friends.|`|55aYfhyRaa	Well don't go out with somebody if you don't like them like that.. And just do what feels right to you. You shouldn't get involved with people who hang out with druggies and have bad family.. But if you want, go ahead. She could be WAYY different. Good luck!  :]|`|8R6vAbkMaa	don't say no just because of her friends and family..say no because you don't like her and if you really don't like her just tell her that straight up..it's the easiest way!|`|gFfOsxR0aa	why would you want to  go out with a girl that hangs around   druggies and whose brother is in jail?  just sayin.....
AA11113523	The promise ring could be a ring she wears as a sign that she wont have sex to shes married.  or it was just something given to her that she likes, so she wears it. even if a bf did give it to her, it doesnt necessarily mean that she is still into him.  I still have plenty of stuff my boyfriends have given me.  The next time you ask for directions, jus invite her to where you are going. or simply ask her if she wants to grab something to eat or something. Make it seem more casual at first, then, if she accepts, later on u can ask her on a real date. that way u will know for sure there is no other guys in her life.|`|Hkr9fsrBaa	The promise ring could just be a purity ring.  Like she's waiting to have sex until she is married.|`|GyomG70uaa	the promise ring says that she has another guy who means a lot to her, so she's probably just flirting around|`|DFMtUL5daa	I bet it's just a purity ring. Lot's of my friends have those.
oZnMqtvwaa	Why not? Love does not have age's limitation. The only important thing is you love him, and he loves you. Why should you care about people's thought when you want to be your boyfriend. It will be weird if you care about it. There are tons of couples that boys are older than girls but their relationship cannot maintain long. So what's the matter if he is younger than you. You guyz are in good shape. If you care about it, do u think he will also care. If he cares, and is shy, and not tell his friends that his gf is older than him. What do u feel? just to put you into his position and think about it. Hope that you will be ok...|`|LpSgQOnWaa	hells yeah! it's not wierd! my best friend has been going out with a guy two years younger than her and she's happy! if someone says something, just ignore. good luck!!|`|2aWCJe58aa	Age is not a barrier for love ..

If you really care about him, age should not be an issue. If people talk, let them talk. Ultimately, you're the one in the relationship with someone you care about and they're just outsiders wishing they were in your position.|`|3QuXf3bVaa	NOT AT ALL|`|blOwAhXoaa	They say love has no limits.

AA10696542	WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD. THAT IS ILLEGAL. I had the same situation. I was dating a girl I didn't really like and her sister was 15 and her sisters bf was 18.

I mean,if your parents approve,then it's okay.  I say,you two go for it(:    Edit: I didn't mean go for it literally.  And some of you people really are a pain in the ***,you know!  They've been together for two years,he obviously doesn't want to use her!  You go girl(:|`|6Eo7k6Dxaa	well u be with who ya wanna be with as long as u guys do stuff together and things you like to do if he moves to fast for you then cut da dude|`|XC1xVVDDaa	nothink wrong with that at all if you like each other. its up to you thought, can you ignore what people might say. some people are a pain i no that.  |`|BLMTDfOBaa	I think it's great! People cant tell you who to go out with or how old they should be! Love is love and there is nothing anyone can do about it!!|`|0AQKtAotaa	its only a three year difference whats so wrong with that?  your both in high school right i don't think that is so bad|`|Z7AF5AN5aa	Society gets enraged at any sex that doesnt involve a 47 year old cougar and a 13 yaer old guy. All other sex is bashed endlessly. Tahts the only sex in society that always gets a "way to go kiddo" comment.       Just have fun. I dont see a problem with it. Its better for a girl to be 3 years younger than us than 3 years older. Any statistical study of marriage would confirm this.     Your parents like him. He must be a great guy.   
TuhjHTdNaa	Oh my God...... why can I not meet anyone like you???????????????!    I have raised question like this in former incarnations, and always got treated like I am a freak. Like you, I love kissing and affection so much... Such a turn on... but often, once it gets down to the sex, I get totally disinterested. And i am 28 - it won't change now.    I think so much pressure is put on people to do it and enjoy it, that it never lives up to expectation. I find it a chore, a task, but then I have never had sex with anyone I find attractive, so maybe that is why...|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Hi,    I wonder why.  If enjoy the foreplay, the kissing and cuddling what is there so bad about finishing it?  Do you feel dirty about it?  Has there been a problem is the past that we don't know of?  I guess there will be more people who don't like to have sex at all but you will be in the minority.    -R.|`|Thw2IgxQaa	Sex is overrated (it's okay), foreplay is the bomb. I can relate though I still enjoy sex somewhat. (I'm 18)|`|atkBDVO0aa	Sex is great WITH THE RIGHT PERSON. It doesnt have to be "special" as long as you both enjoy it that is fine. But there is no rush. Doing what your doing is enjoyable and if thats what you like at the moment then good for you|`|358aaaa8c788b94641d4f774b758d97daa	its not such a great thing.. overrated..|`|jsQBCAF7aa	     Hi.       This is a really broad subject.  I'd say that it all depends with whom you  do it.  If you find someone who knows how to "light up your fire", you'll probably love it.       Don't worry, everybody feels this way sometimes.       Take care.|`|ce6911914cf5c0519c12db91eb0064afaa	you should see a psychologist theres a reason why you dont enjoy it|`|iPz9dVubaa	It might be just you    SteveC|`|AA11004428	how old are you? maybe youre just young and immature. it is unnatural to not like and enjoy sex no matter if youre a girl or a guy. i mean have you ever pleasured yourself? i mean, come on. theres no better physical feeling. (im not talking about emotional)|`|MV3nLeWnaa	I'm the same as you I don't see the amazement for it!    It's nice when your with someone you like but I'd choose a cuddle over it any day!!!!!    |`|GuRluYmraa	i cant say that i agree fully with you but honestly it could be down to the fact that maybe you havent figured out what exactly you like or what works for you! I wouldnt worry bout it, sometimes sex just isnt for some people.  Just wondering what age you might be?   |`|DrCybnD8aa	yeah. it only explores one area of the mind. Suppose its like eating a sandwich|`|P7GIfcoPaa	lol i'm 16 and i think sex it completely overrated. |`|1P8XhZYVaa	Kind of. Sex is good, but I'm not the type of person to do anything to get it, if you know what I mean. I'd sooner get kissing than strip down to the bear essentials. |`|d4UoBRleaa	ya probs rite lol i dnt reckon its all its cracked up to be  totally agree so dont worry about it :D xxx|`|qtJUL2O1aa	I love it. I respect you but I love it, that's soooo delicious ..... |`|cE1hk3A2aa	theres somethink wrong with u |`|LTyX4z2Iaa	I use to for a bit, but that was because I had low self-esteem and wasn't comfortable being naked in front of someone. But now I still know what you mean. I do prefer cuddling and making out to going all out with sex. It's more fun to me. It can be extremely fullfilling in itself. I look forward to a good make out session more than actual sex. |`|35c2f57bee854f5a2c9e00eeebd9319baa	It depends how old you are...if you're both doing it right it should blow your mind.|`|fdcsmIMJaa	you possibly feel like that because you are ugly hun.|`|clNxVwVGaa	you a weirdo|`|AA12036282	yeah i know wot your saying - i just not got the enthusiasm for it either  i enjoy it ok when i do get around to doing it but i mostly can't be bothered, not even the kissing and cuddling - really enjoyed it in my late teens but that was a long time ago (i'm mid 30's too) -much rather a good movie and a couple of glasses of wine followed by a good nights sleep|`|1EUzTpxjaa	i agree with you. i think sex is so overrated. although i haven't met the right guy yet so that probably explains it, but every guy io've been with has sucked. i prefer cuddling and foreplay too. the guys that i've been with didn't like kissing first or foreplay so i guess that just kind of ruined it you know?|`|n8lKKkEfaa	I enjoy it, and I love the female body in different shapes, sizes, races and ages, including every inch of the body, but at the same time I've always believed that sex is overrated.  I mean I like it and all the freaky or crazy things you can do with the right person, but there is a lot more to life than just sex, so for me if I can find someone who may just want a relationship with just cuddling, touching, teasing, but not really having to go all the way, then I'd ok with it.  There are so many things to do in life and experience, even just fully enjoying the company of a person is an experience in itself.    In other words I can go a year or two without sex, and just enjoy the company of the person and all the kissing and cuddling, but that's partially because I'm also a person who enjoys touchy feely women, and whenever women have touched me, caressed me or done something that involves touching I enjoyed it, and always will.  It's ok to just wanna touch an dbe touche, but not necessarily want to have sex.  Making love to the mind of the person you are with is actually an enjoyable thing.
ho6CmCSyaa	Yes, he likes you. Plain and simple!|`|JbpsQf7gaa	anyone that admits they would have "done something to you" had they been drunk is a tool. why would you want a guy that would openly take advantage of you? thats messed upppp. plus hes old and your young and thats gross here in the states bia
OT3eczxaaa	You definitely need to confront him. YOU don't go anywhere - you stay in that house with your kids. If anyone needs to leave, it's him. Print the picture. He may not be cheating, but he's definitely lying to you about what he's doing after work and THAT needs to be addressed.    Now, you may or may not end up divorced. The exact same thing happened to a friend of mine, but they're still married (and happier than ever) 20 years later. It takes a LOT of work to save a marriage, but only you know if it's worth it.    All the best to you!|`|9ebf7fd4431967c61856700a5363bf7faa	well those r signs of cheatin and if i were u then i would do a check in every once in awhile just call him or mayb visit him... u no and just say that i missed u and or the baby is missin u... honestly i think he is cheatin on u cause no one deletes messages inless they r feard some1 will read them so yea... idk wat 2 do i think u should stay for the kids but then that hate hate relationship will affect them... so think bout u and ur kids... just forst get some evidence that he is chaetin and c wat he says... gud luck|`|d8DqZblcaa	Look, your husband is human and he just might be reacting a bit before having another child. Women can transition a lot more easier into becoming wife's and mothers because we prepare ourselves for that long before we do it. Men are totally different. They avoid, rebel against, and try to escape as much as they can from these major commitments and it is all because they are afraid that they will not be strong enough, or they will disappoint us by not being men enough for the task at hand.   Your husband knows that he will be expected to be THE MAN now, to provide and protect, and he might just panic inside, but as a man that he is, he will not talk about it or let it show, because guess what, he thinks if he tells you he'll be less of a man.  I am just trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, because for men it is a lot harder then we think it is.|`|FSVGnFkdaa	Talk to your husband about it. Let him know that he has hurt you and what you have seen on facebook. Your husband may be fooling around so who knows. If he is that tight about his cell phone then something must be going on. I would be worried too. My husband and I never hide each others phone. We always leave it where eaither of us may be able to answer a phone call or text from whichever phone is ringing. That's trust! Talk to your husband, he should be home more often instead of out partying. After work, he needs to be HOME!|`|1epjqrflaa	I am sorry you have to go through this crap when your prego. Cops are such assholes, no I see they are *****y husbands as well. Leave him, get child support, get an education and find a man that comes home when he is expected.|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	Confront him. Tell him what you know. It could be that he hasn't cheated yet, and maybe you can stop him from doing it.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	oh dear. this does not sound good. you need to talk to him about it and try to work it out. but most importantly, you have to be willing to end it if it cant be reconciled. it is no good to stay in an unhappy marriage for the children. good luck to you! try to stay calm for the baby|`|K7fVSLSKaa	If you are tired of being suspicious, having doubts, feeling angry and you want answers that are black and white then check this out and you can learn out to tell if your spouse is cheating within 5 minutes or less...don't take someone elses word for it, stop doubting...find the truth    http://www.productsupplycenter.com/web18...|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Well, I'm trying to put myself into your shoes. If I really didn't have anywhere to go and I didn't have a job to support myself (or at least a career to go back to after the baby was born) I would probably wait until after the child is born and I've recovered from childbirth before confronting him. He does need to be confronted even if he's not having an actual affair, he needs to be there for you more than anything during this time. After confronting him, I would seek counseling.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Print the picture, have the locks changed, and tape it to the outside of the front door.  He is cheating, for sure!
eAFbZgr2aa	Didn't you ask this a couple times already?  Okay, you're in high school. Kids your age should feel comfortable about asking each other out on dates and stuff.. Just ask her. It's no big deal.|`|AWQxh8reaa	this kinda happened with this kid  except im the girl  and i start all the convos.  and now i feel like im bothering him    just uhhm.. hm are either of u into music? ask if she likes a certain band or if shes been to any concerts.. girls will always tlk about things that  intrest them!     answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|gFoy6gnDaa	just start a conversetaion with her and ask her for her phone number.  if you think she kinda likes you she is probably gonna give it to you|`|GMFfG6QHaa	the best way to ask a girl for her number is just to do it && be brave [: dont pull her away from her friends because thats just weird to girls. maybe while you guys are talking or walking together say hey i was wondering if i could have your number? the only way a girl will say no is if your really weird && creepy. besides that we'll say yes even if we don't like you cause we don't wanna come off mean . good luck! i hope i helped.|`|QDIzi6qLaa	that's cute. im a sophomore too!!  okay well what you should do since you guys are comfortable with each other it shouldn't be awkward. just talk to her and then ask hey (her name) can i have your phone number just in case you want to hang out someday or i can talk to. but just say it really nice and not weird but calm.|`|9IFitgOgaa	wow...I never even thought of the cellphone one...ima use it!    btw, just say something like... Hey, my friends are going to _____ this weekend, and I was wondering if you wanna come?    and if she says yes, then say "cool, lemme get your number so I can call you to meet up and ect" but usually if she says yes, then she'll automatically offer the number to you right after    if she says no...then I dont think shes interested in you...cause if she likes you, then theres no way she'll say no|`|YaLKbnouaa	why ask her for just her number when you can get a date out of it as well?  seriously, you just have to muster  your courage and ask her if she wants to "hang out" this weekend...then ask for her number so you can get in contact with her to make plans.      tah-dah.  girls like guys who don't play games.  be forward but not "OMG I LOVE YOU LOVE ME BACK!!! 0_o"  smile, make eye contact, and be yourself.|`|HCXEmvlbaa	dude just follow her home and look at her house address and then use it to look up her number on the internet  then you can avoid this whole situation|`|GV7dTFq9aa	OK.  I'm a freshman (College) but it is still kinda the same.  Just be yourself.  Don't try to show off and be someone your not.  Find out what kind of things she likes and then casually bring one of the topics up in conversation.  Girls like it when guys seem really into them.  Not like stalker stuff, just find a common interest and talk about it .  Girls hate pickup lines.  girls also like guys that have something going on other than in their pants.  Are you a good student in the classes you share?  If you are lazy and a do nothing ....big turnoff.
CDzStUPUaa	Continue what you're doing.  Since her re-actions are positive, she's enjoying the attention.  Step up the flirting a bit.  If you still get good vibes and she smiles a lot   when she sees you;  I'd take the next step and ask for her number.  Lots of luck!   :)
dGL5xCrqaa	I'm not a guy, but I understand where you're coming from so I thought my experience would make some good input.    He likes you!|`|CEqYjcBeaa	How about you guys just exchange phone numbers and go that route. It's easier to tell what someone is feeling when you hear their voice as apposed to just a few words sent back and forth electronically.|`|nO2vflnPaa	I'm sorry, I know I'm not a dude, but I really needed the 2 points, sorry :-/
vBIwaQ0qaa	Talk to him and find out how he feels about you. That's the only way to do this. You will never really know unless you talk to him up front.|`|UMldrfY2aa	I would tell him!|`|C2bh4Jtcaa	i wouldnt mess with him if he has a gf, as you said you dont know what shes like and she might get mad|`|crBIWlbxaa	well you must really see if he doesn't feels anything for her gf and feels something for you otherwise it will be a disaster if you make a move|`|gBYYMKhZaa	iv had the exact same problem b4 its really annoying talk to him and just bring her up in a conversation but don't talk to much if he really likes her like loves her don't tell him it will just confuse him and when you get what you want you might not want it   but if he likes her but not all that much tell him how you feel he could like you more than this girl just make sure you don't bump in to her that's bad they will always hate you and have a go at you every time you see them so just see how much he likes this girl then tell him or not but if he doesn't like you in the same way try to still be his friend liking someone will never stop you from being friends it might be a little weird for a bit but that will soon go   good luck hope he likes to in the same way|`|2hpxAOLgaa	OMG GIRL U GOTTA GROW UP DONT U SEE HE ALREADY  HAS A GIRLFRIEND!|`|5xm6pS2Saa	This is a very tough situation. It's heartbreaking, but maybe you should wait until him and his girlfriend are toast. You don't want to tell him and then wreck your friendship. But that doesn't mean you have to put your entire life on hold. Find another cute guy you like, if possible. Kepp your options open, hang with your friends, and just have fun even if you can't have him just yet. I hope everything works out |`|lHUmI9Ufaa	i say if you think you are prettier and yall have more in common, and you think you could win go for it, i am in the same thing right now, i am like with this guy that likes me and my freind, and we are totaly diff from each other, and i dont get it, but i say go for it!!! dont stop trying, get ur man!!!|`|td7Euv1Gaa	I wouldnt go there...its too messy.  First if he is willing to be unfaithful or dump his gf to immediatly go out with you thats not cool and he will probably do it to you one day.  If he likes you and is a good guy he'll do it in steps.  First he will break up with his gf and then wait a bit before asking you out....its kinda the best way to go about it.  But i would just wait and see what happens, he may just like you as a friend and if thats the case you probably want to stay friends.  making a move while he has a gf could freak him out.|`|CwAHOdEjaa	All i can say is keep it in you.Tell him if you really want to but i wouldn't if i was you.     Wait in-till they break up then wait a few days.  And then tell him.|`|1xNzHIYKaa	Well,   If you like him and you want to be more than friends and you dont want to break his GF's Heart, I say make him tell you, not you tell him, Make him know u like him by ur body language, and Go attractive, Make a new cute Hairstyle where ur hair is open, and ask him if he likes it, Get a cool shirt and ask him if he likes, new sunglasses etc...., and if you think he got to you, then put a really nice cool not to showy but shows lipstick or lipgloss and ask him if he likes it. Overall in that style of getting him come to you, and then u can just start meeting at the mall at friends like bring 1 of ur friends over, and make him thinks why she brought her friend? i wanna be wid her alone... and then he goes crazy about you and then he'll tell you he wants to date you.. Just dont tell him u love him that will reuin ur friendship. Hope i helped and it works Gr8 wid u and him..|`|YjmeAZluaa	ok gurl, take this as a best answer u got!. u trust GOD? If trust, 1st, pray 1st. ok? then, the brave person can still live in this world. so, u must brave my gurl. but not in rushing. ok, u set the appointment with him, maybe get some breakfast together, n then, make him happy with ur sweet memory with him. let him remind that he has a sweet memory with u.ok? then, just tell what in ur heart. just tell, u can see the reaction. positive reaction... ok?    aan 176 with style
O2xwMwHYaa	dunno if you want her. she could be drawn to chaotic men for a number of reason. this type of girl will not be attracted to a good guy. your efforts are better spent elsewhere on a healthy relationship. if she is a normal person with a run of bad luck and you have interest, try her out and see what happens.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	I would have to go with the same thing I said when I answered this 15 minutes ago in singles and dating. It was a spectacular answer!!|`|AA11814087	I'd leave the loser even if the good guy was not around. The hitting thing is not cool.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Probably nothing; women being beaten are normally too frightened to leave or even notice other men.  But I also wouldn't leave someone just because he was rich and had a Lamborghini! I think I'd just be single for a while.|`|AjnXtMFeaa	Go say whats up. abuse can mess up your thinking really badly. Go day hi.|`|3g1ZgTe4aa	Do not let love pass u by. go and get her and tell her that you love her with every cell of your body and without her you cease to exist.

He is a teenage boy right now all he wants to do is have fun and yes a lot of that fun time is spent with his boys rather then you. You will only push him away if you keep hounded him like asking him do you still like me? Do you still need me? STOP leave him alone don't stress about it, When he is with his boys you go with your friends. Don't stress so much about it enjoy the ride for now b/c im sure you both know it will not last forever at such a young age so live for today and enjoy him when you want. Guys are more into the girls that don't give them the time of day rather then the girl that is so needy.|`|2tCbCvzXaa	Try taking a break.

" es que aparte de mi novio, l tambin tiene a su esposa"    Quien tiene esposa?  Tu novio es casado?  El pap del novio es casado?  QUE NO FUISTE A LA ESCUELA'??  NO ENTIENDO !!!!

5xm6pS2Saa	If he says he loves you, then maybe he really means it. Only an evil guy would fool around about that. Confront him next time you see him. Talking face to face is more personal, so he can't run away. Ask him what his deal is and go from there. Good luck! |`|Cjw1zn11aa	Hmmmm, could be. You could email that question back and see what he says. I think it's best to hear it from him. And you could explain why you sed no to his m8 which might make him feel better. Hope everything works out for you. He seems like a nice guy. : )
zkoYvOaLaa	You screwed up...face it.  a 5 page e-mail?  come on seriously?  Some women consider that stalking! Send her something encouraging, but short.  Give her her space, text her or call her just to say hi and that you're thinking of her and hope her day is going well...go back to the basics man!  She's keeping you at a distance for a reason.  Let her come to you, send her flowers NOT ROSES!!!!!!!!!!!  Something simple to let her know you're thinking of her and that you know she needs the time....DON'T PUSH!|`|HtaO5Uu6aa	OMFG if you can write something like that in here id hate to imagine the pages of total and utter crap you must force her to read!! I think maybe she is trying to study and do her work and you are constantly bombarding her with all this rubbish and then asking for responses every five seconds maybe u shud try giving her some time out. Maybe you think your relationship is more than it really is and she is getting annoyed with you being a nuisance|`|c8919cabde08b4615cc9a1c66b9f10a4aa	wow, unbelievable... u rock|`|7HWon9leaa	wow that was supa long...anyways it seems that you should give her some space maybe she's getting irritated that your sending her mail through the university or cause your talking about things so strongly. like your saying all this stuff like im really sorry because of blah blah blah and with the whole emailing her that five page email, maybe she didn't get to read the whole thing, that's why she only typed  that little thing. but yeah you should definitely give her some space cause i know i would be irritated.|`|8JQA7ecBaa	It's seems to be a total power struggle.    I'd say back off a bit|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	     Just a guess but it sounds like she likes you but she has goals and ambitions that she really wants.She sounds like she is struugling with a few things.You will nee dto honestly convince her that you will not want to interfere with any of her goals and support her in every way.       Thing is,you need your own goals that you will need to pursue even if you do or don't hook up with her....she can respect that.And for Gods sake,don't sound so damn needy!! She's not the only one around!!|`|RBBmMqC7aa	I am shocked because you are a good sounding guy. Playing games and getting even is not the way for sure, alas you must play hers and simmer, and if she truly cares for you she will begin to come around and miss your good intentions. My advice friend patience. 
kERP7zAhaa	yes      and you're way to young to have sex anyway|`|dJkNofnoaa	Just ask if you're ready, talk to him about it, and be safe. If you have any doubts at all don't. And ask yourself will he still love me in the morning? I hope everything works out for you. I'm in your same situation and we're so in love, real love not puppy love, and plan to be together forever, like marriage and family|`|EzNbeSpUaa	It can either make it or break it.. but if you feel like you really love the guy at your age then go for it but make sure you know you wont regret it.|`|uff3kOoFaa	absolutely|`|GUNSTG6uaa	im around your age and most of my friends who have had sex with their boyfriends lasted only about a month after that  but i dont know you or your situation it could be different, but i just think its better for you to wait   and if your questioning it then its probably not the best idea
t9rTToWYaa	Tell her that if she doesn't use protection, she will get unwanted pregnancies, STIs, and STDs.  Simply tell her.|`|47jMXUkkaa	tell her u have heard of a girl who had unprotected sex got pregnant and ended up killing her baby inside i have a sister works all the time|`|aIkwIyYqaa	Does she want to get pregnant?

wzpCMI44aa	That's quite a generalization there. I know my husband was very eager to marry me, and he loves being married to me and he tells me so all the time.    If you're talking about why men don't care about weddings, that's another story. Mine couldn't have cared less.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Men take longer than women to settle down, in general.  This is because they can have the milk for free in most cases, so they will not buy the cow.  People used to get married so they could live together and have sex.  They do that now without marriage, so men are in no rush.  Plus, a guy is probably having fun going through many women to find out which is "the one".|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	some of them do.  my fiance does, cause he will only  be the first of his high school friends to do so, and only the second of ANY of his friends to do so.  he also cares cause im taking his name and im a new member of his family.      my brother also cared about getting married to his wife.  trust me, he was super involved in the planning, cause we have a huge family and he wanted to make sure everything went smoothly      my other brother also cared because he and his wife wanted the wedding to truely be a reflection of them as a couple and it was thanks to his and her awsome planning and ideas|`|RuKK1LYiaa	because its completely girly and most of us girls believe its our day and no one elses so the men dont care at all, they just want to know when where and what time to be there and are told what to wear.lol|`|m13CCGc1aa	Depends on the guy and depends on the girl they are with.|`|3secB3Smaa	Men do care. But men need to be support of the family. A man wants to be financially secure so he can take care of his children and wife. If a  man is not secure he cannot think about marriage.  Also men,do not feel like settling down as soon as women do. Women need to have children by a certain age,men do not have to worry about that.  Also men can skip the family and children part and wait till they are older and just get married to a younger women,but still not young enough to want any children,. They just have more options.|`|sZePlWTQaa	I think they care enough when they find the "right one."|`|S9kYCOnaaa	I think most men do care about getting married...it's a huge step. I just think that most men do not find the planning interesting. My fiance cares very much about getting married...that's why he proposed to me :D|`|AA11349925	Lots of men do, lots of men don't each man is different so you can't generalise in such a way.|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Men will tell women they are "not interested in marriage" when they don't want to be married to the particular woman they are talking to.  Especially if they are casually dating this woman.  If a man love love loves a woman, he will want to marry her, and have her all to himself.  In most cases.|`|FnskUYpqaa	I wouldn't say they don't care but the reason that women seem to "care" more is because women can have children for x amount of years and if you don't have them by say 40 it only gets harder to be able to get pregnant. Men on the other hand can have children until they die so there in no hurry to settle down unless they find the right one. That's why a lot of women seem so desperate.
TDLyqejqaa	It's not necessarily bad. Your profile is a lot better than your face-on picture. Your hips might be a TAD too big, but you have a very cute butt. I am just being honest, not mean at all.

We're still friends, b/c we broke up b/c of a personal problem on her side. So we still talk. It hurts, and friendship may be a bit different from now on, but if you care about him and if he will care about you back, just make sure you keep that genuine thing going that made u friends|`|byHh0A3Eaa	can't he take a hint? flirt with him and talk about sexual stuff,  you shouldn't have to stick his face in it.

We're so good together eh?" , things like that.|`|iLRE4yF3aa	uh i wouldn't flat out tell him... see if you can arrange a first kiss. then if you can, tell him. that way you won't seem random and off-base. if you can't get him to kiss you, he probably doesn't like you back. it'll spare you some embarrassment.|`|2pvtnd0gaa	if hes single, tell him.  but dont just say you like him, hint towards it by saying you enjoy how well you 2 get along, and how cool things are between you two.. itd b nice to date a guy like him.. stuff like that, then slide in something like, u wouldnt mind giving it a shot|`|4e7396814e6ad0f7293c08e793cf2a20aa	Just b careful , i always tell my friends to date outside our friend circle because when they break up annd move on to other people it just makes the get togethers awkward. especially if they ended in bad terms. but yuou never know trust your heart and make sure he feels the same.|`|UkXmvKLsaa	hmm ive been in this situation before. in my experience you should tell him. but dont hurt him!!! one of my best friends liked me and didnt tell me until hella late .i went out with her and ended up falling for her, then she broke up with me :[ made me sad.|`|MVCKkQvraa	Being friends is better than nothing. You could tell him but, I really have seen that ruin great friendships way to many times and I don't want that to happen to you because think of it this way...

Depending on how he is.|`|JM1Y2Wf9aa	I thick that you should tell him and see what   he says about it and if he said no he   doesn't like ask him if you still could be   friends.|`|37Vq9dA0aa	umm it depends on how close you two are.  you could always ask him to Promise to keep things the   same after you tell him. that  works some times.    i went through that for gr 6 but in gr7 i decided that   i had to tell him. i told him over msn cuz im just whimpy like that  but it went pretty well he said he already knew. But he didn't like me like that  we were friends till we left for different high schools.    plus i danced with him at grad :)    good luck :)|`|gE73TDt9aa	tell him how you feel and go forward slowly. maybe set some guidlines together
k1ARLRTMaa	i have done that. he lived right next door. while it is nice while your dating, if you end on a bad note it will be veryyy akward! i see him all the time now. i hate it.|`|gix0EL8Kaa	yeah!  the guy I like right now is actually my neighbor! it would be sort of awkward if we broke up (were not dating yet, so this is all just hypothetical) since we walk to the bus stop together everyday, but other than that we don't really see each other much.  and besides, were both nice people, so I don't see why any sort of break up would be awkward.  if we did break up it would probably just be after getting tired of each other.|`|I25M4tmlaa	yesss! it makes it better cause you see them more|`|XghG4z6haa	if you like them, then sure.|`|mlb1wwlsaa	Well sure, why not? If you like the person, there's no reason not to date them.   The only problem is if or when you guys break up, it might be awkward having to see each other. If you're both mature though that shouldn't be a problem.|`|8R6vAbkMaa	i did!..but we broke up because he moved so we didn't really have to see each other much..i hate that i have to see his house every time i come home though and it makes me think about him..but i'm getting over it, soon it will be just another house

He's 97, and he's going to die soon, whether he's sick or not.  It's nice that you love him, but girl, you can't do anything.|`|AQkzLtB7aa	You guess?   Oh boy, have you got yourself into a lot of trouble.     I really don't understand how he could have said yes, seeing as it's damn obvious you were after his money. I guess any man can't resist a pretty, young girl.     All I'd say, if you truly regret your initial actions and do love him, make sure he knows before he passes away. Tell him how you feel and be honest. Perhaps you could suggest he use this money of his to help himself get better, than buy you designer clothing.     I'm sorry if I've been harsh on you, but really, it's sick and immoral to take advantage of someone like that and use them for their money. Would you like it if someone did that to you? |`|qQ4AnZpQaa	Put that money to good use.

8CIqcym8aa	i think u guys should just go, if u still get bad vibes after, then break it off|`|HX747ZnMaa	if you like her you shouldn't think that she's taking advantage on you for a few dollars of movies tickets if I were her if I know that you are thinking that way I wouldn't even talk with you girls don't like cheap guys .|`|AA10289805	No. Don't call it off. She was testing to see if it was a date, and you confirmed it was a date. There's no reason for you to think she was taking advantage of you.|`|I1wwpx69aa	I think you should. I don't think she's taking advantage of you, it sounds to me like she just wanted to make sure its a date & you're treating her.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Why? if it's  a date you should be paying. She did say her mum wouldn't give her the money so you could have said to wait for another time! you offered so why you making it a big deal?|`|rS66egIPaa	No! Take her.   You suggested that you should pay! She's not taking advantage of you.|`|j7qfy6BEaa	and break her tender little heart, now why would you do that??|`|xIQ2bAsCaa	Why would she be taking advantage of you when you're the one who basically offered to pay..|`|SYf5kaoBaa	No you shouldn't call it off give it a try it will be fun|`|HhxlM8vXaa	NO DUMBAZZ|`|teQy51hDaa	Still go!!!!!!!!!|`|oebxjRRfaa	how old are you??? you sound young,immature and stupid.....ovbsiley she wnts 2 still go 2 the movies with you! and u r the guy SO PAY!|`|bjgs0szFaa	I don't understand why you feel like you're being taken advantage of.  You offered to pay for the movies, you left it up to her to make it a date, so what's the problem?|`|W2J7E8Eiaa	no.. if your friends your probably just both confused ... take her see how it goes|`|AA11113523	wat?  i dont understand how u can feel taken advantage of?  take her! she obviously wants to go.  she jus didnt want to assume that u were paying, because it seemed unclear if it was a date or not. ur the guy, ur supposed to pay, thats wat u do. dont feel taken advantage of because im sure she wasnt trying to take advantage of you.|`|XbURFztdaa	Hmmmmm the guy doesn't always have to pay on the date, but as from the conversation above it pretty much seems like you offered to, you can't feel taken advantage of. Now, if you really don't wanna pay then don't go, but if you like someone then it'd be silly to call off a date just because they accept your offer of paying. Try to be a little more mature about this, I realise obviously you are quite young (if her mum has to give her the money....) but girls like guys to act grown up.|`|V1PbqDV6aa	you should still take her in the end you were the one who offered and insisted after she said she had no money so i think you should.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	I'd say take her. She sounds like she might have some interest, but wasn't sure if you were on the same page or not and didn't want to assume anything. It's worth a shot to see how she reacts and treats you. If anything you are out a little bit of money, that's what dating is all about anyway.|`|RYARNa8Qaa	NO! guys r supposed to pay for the first date. its called common courtesy. just take her out!!!|`|Ba3IqiZtaa	Well, that was a bit of a turn off, but if she wasn't sure if it was a date then I would think it is okay. From what I think, if you guys didn't say beforehand that it was a date then I would've probably tried to test the waters too, but in this case it doesn't seem like it. I would probably just take this situation into consideration and just go ahead and go on a date. If you guys hit it off real well on the date then keep dating, if not just move on to the next.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	she tell you the truth and you ask if she worth it i say yes she is ..|`|29maScwJaa	You were the one who mentioned it being a date first, and you said you're supposed to pay. So why would you feel taken advantage of? Take her|`|TFdFb11maa	NO! take her|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	LOL! Usually when you have to ask the answer is NO.     Regardless, I don't see where you are being taken advantage of. Do you want to date this person or not? If so, then you should pay anyway. That is what a gentleman does.|`|xmWxafHSaa	Why do feel taken advantage of?  She was trying to make sure that you knew it was a date.  It was just her way of figuring it out with coming right out and saying it.  In case you didn't think it was, she could have saved some embarrassment on her part.  You two like each other, so go on the date and have fun.|`|QHx95iZDaa	take her|`|xd9fq0CKaa	she may of jus been nervous .. but if u think ur being taken advantage of wel jus sort a date to the park or something to check she's going for you. x|`|a984cQjKaa	if you initiated the date, and it's as more than friends, it's YOUR job to pay.  she gave you the chance to back out since she couldn't pay, so stop being a cheapskate if you like her.
yCLq4dJCaa	There are countless causes of adultery committed by men and women alike. But the results are painful, spiritually or  or physically.  Many Innocent partners have been infested by the aids virus.  And many homes have been broken.  Plus it is a sin against the law of God|`|wnkoTEqVaa	People want to have their cake and eat it to.|`|YUaWQNeFaa	because they arent happy with who they are with and need to be satisfied by seeing someone new|`|m571yrLnaa	because their partner is not satisfying them enough|`|VBPYDYrRaa	Because many men can have sex with other woman and it doesnt change a single emotion of love towards his gf. When woman have sex they are more likely to want that person as a relationship partner.|`|zg6sgA3faa	It was not love then...|`|SmsV5WHqaa	Because There Bored And Not Been Satisfied Enough    Or Maybe    Because They Want More Than What They Can Afford    Or Evan    They Have Fallen Out Of Love With There Partner And Found Some One Else    Cool Question By The Way    LOve Kennedy Elise|`|wQtbKR70aa	The ***** Aint Puttin Out!!|`|Yf5yJiQxaa	because people now indays like to show off there body|`|vQWRIDkLaa	That's a good question...........Personally some people just can't handle committment no matter how much they love you they just can't.Then you have others that are not getting it the way they want..Me being with my husband 10 years i don't always want to make love i just want a good f**$ and call it a night.But we women sometimes make it to emotional.I have a friend and evevn though he LOVES HIS GIRLFRIEND OF 2YEARS It just does something for him to get a littl something different at times.But who really knows I'm pretty sure everyone thinks differently about why........
a5vzw7lcaa	Well since its a truth or dare game..for his enjoyment, he'd probably want more of a daily thing to make it funny. if it was everymonth.. then its too casual.. have fun with it, play along, and let it go for a few days :)|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Every Thursday should work, for about 3 weeks. How long do you have to do without? lol    Regards,  Dan|`|Xztm7mh7aa	Show me a participant in a "Lame Dare" and I'll show you one "Lame Dame"......you need to go back to school....you sound very uneducated and pathetic|`|lgbC5pivaa	Your not worthy.

dadUWmJpaa	It's too bad all of this has happened. The problem is in situations like this more than one answer could be right and you're the only one who is going to be able to judge it. What do you think your bf would want? Do you think he ever had an inkling the child wasn't his? Or would it have mattered to him? If you think he was the type of man who would have gone on being a father to this child it might not ever really matter. Don't go on with the lie for the sake of gain but if you really believe this man would have continued to love his daughter knowing it was not his blood child theres no real reason to remove his family from the child's life.     On the other hand if you suspect the situation could become more difficult in the future, it's better to tell the truth now. The last thing you want is to betray your bfs memory.    If you're going to tell the truth pick one of his family members who you think will take the news rationally and allow them to tell the others.|`|qmVcPFLDaa	Sorry about your bf. But you once lied u got to stick with that lie now cause u don't want to breack the families heart.|`|56f1b42c11fe8022a431c527e63e3085aa	uh.. first of all, wow.     you need to tell your bf's family the truth. As hard as it may be for them, and for you, they need to know. Not only will you and your baby, and your babies family be living a lie, but you could run into legal issues if the baby stands to inherit anything (no, i cannot spell). Also, whoever the real father is needs to know that he has a two year old spawn walking around, even if he doesn't give a care. The truth may hurt, but once its out there, its out there. if his family rejects you and your child, so be it. Atleast you two can live in peace, knowing the truth, and not having guilt weigh you down. and what if they accept it, and still accept you and the baby, because they realize their son loved her, and so do u? then you've gained something, and your still free of that guilt.     Go for the truth girl. *leaps onto the cliche wagon* the truth shall set you free! |`|YpF9erzMaa	Tell them now. It's going to be heartbreaking and devastating for them, considering that they lost their son and now they are going to lose their grand child. You daughter and her biological father deserve to know each other and it's not fair to them that you continue to keep this a secret. The biological father is missing out on precious time and so is your daughter. You should have told your deceased bf and his family a long time ago. Don't let your situation dictate the future of your child. You didn't tell your deceased ex because you were out of a job and needed his help. That was selfish of you, you were only thinking about yourself and did not care who you deceived and the impact it would have on others. You can't let this go on any longer. His parents, you daughter and her biological father all need to know. I'm sure his parents will continue to love your child, because she's the innocent one and did not ask for any of this. Be woman enough and set things straight with them. That's quite a burden to be carrying around. Remember, whatever you do in the dark will come to light, may not be now but one day. You choose not to tell them now and one day they happen to find out, how do you think they will look at you? How would you expect them to react? How will it make you feel when it all comes out in the open w/o them hearing it from you?|`|VPYzVNZdaa	don't tell any body  u and ur died bf are only inter and Happy in ur girl  when she became bigger u will tel her|`|AA12392839	uve made more than jst the family happy.u made ur boyfriend happy.  even though it was wrong, uve probly helped a family come together because of love for that baby.whether or not its the hes the real dad, hes the one hu took care of her.he gave her all his love, and so did his family.for her sake at least, she deserves happiness and stability.this family seems like it will be able to give her all those.  gd luck hun

6b2f804b328b7906f19413c462e7e420aa	just back off a little bit.  Maybe cancel the movie with her, and tell her that you are sorry.  But  tell her that if she wants to go to another movie sometime to let you know.  That way she has the oppurtunity to decide.  Dont worry about the phone thing, maybe she lost it or her parents took it...|`|D8FlvN4oaa	Take your time dude. dont come on too strong. If she wants something with you she has your number dont be calling her and texting all the time unless you have a relationship like that. Maybe she did break her phone and had to get a new one hence her friend ask her if she got her phone back. Anyway take it slow and dont be pushy otherwise it seems like your desperate and creepy. just chill and ask if she wants to do something if she says she cant say ok and tell her to get back to you when she can. If she calls you then hang out at that moment.|`|dOcXTq2aaa	Try talking to her about it. If she feels uncomfortable talking to you about it, then she might be ignoring you.    Help me please!!  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|AA11289385	To be honest it does feel like she is avoiding you.doesn't mean she is not into you, but maybe you did came on too strong.the best thing if u want her attention back is not to txt her or do anything for about a week. then try asking her again :) you not chasing after her anymore will definitely make her think. |`|2f8d716fc293f3b33733dbffb01d590aaa	All you can do is try once more and if she doesn't turn up then you should move on. It's a good idea not to spring surprise visits on a girl if you don't know each other well enough. It could make her feel you are being too pushy and presumptuous.|`|TPLxJEkYaa	At first blush it seems as if she's giving you the runaround, but the fact that one of her friends asked about her getting her phone back could lend credence to the story that she broke it and got it back after replacement/repair.  You know her better than I do, so use your best judgment.    As far as going to hang out and her changing her mind, she could have gotten nervous.  Meeting someone in real life after talking to them on the internet can be quite intimidating.  It may help to set up a very laid-back first meeting.  Choose a public place that will give you something to do, like a coffee shop or lunch at a cheap and informal place.  Tell her you can only stay for an hour or so, so that she won't feel like she has gotten into something she can't get out of.    Additionally, don't be afraid to tell her you're nervous about it, or ask if she is, since it's understandable that things like that can be uncomfortable.  People, unintentionally, act differently online and in real life, so it would be best to set aside any expectations you both have.|`|2T87ag61aa	just go with the flow, if she's busy why would she be lying? she probably is. just dont be to desparate|`|xlnWy336aa	dude chicks are screwy and they mess guys up stay away. they are like gonja you wnna smoke it up it gets you fuhcked up same with chicks you wnna talk to her but itll costttt ya|`|Z8IhHVQdaa	She could be telling the truth or she could be leading you on.Some girls like the attention they get online and seek compliments and all that from guys.But when it comes down to actually meeting the person she might not want to.Sorry to be so blunt but she might be using you for your sweet comments and the interst you show in her.It might give her some kinda confident boost and thats all she may want.Try not to get to attached to this girl until you know for sure what shes all about.|`|6ccb483bdcbeec01ead0547481da3ba4aa	She might just be shy about meeting you.    This is exactly what happened with me and my husband meeting from myspace. (Obviously it turned out well).|`|91dkS2kYaa	uhh... maybe she thinks your a pedo. you probably arent but a couple of people i know met a guy online who said he was sixteen and turned out to be thirty. which was creepy. maybe you should suggest some of her friends come along too in a subtle way. maybe somebody advised her against dating a guy she met on the internet.|`|2gdvNDIlaa	dont ever believe any thing people said through internet..  i think she's just playin with u...  dont take it what she said too serious...she too"smart" with this kind of stuff, i guess..  be wise and open minded..people isn't always like what u thought.|`|7qdztxCmaa	Well first of all, meeting up with someone from the internet is very dangerous. Espcially for a girl. One of her friends may have talked some sense into her. You need to meet & stay in a public setting at first. That way you can show her that you mean no harm. Be patient & don't give up. Don't push the issue too hard or you may scare her away. Good Luck!    P.S. Looks mean Squat!|`|TnrxbT4Oaa	Dude you're oversweatn. u're overdoing it. u better not think bout it that much, u know... or else it'll never happen.  Just go with the flow... don't wait for things to happen... Make them happen... Go and pick her up from her place. Surprise her. Get a big "Bouquet" and pay her a visit. A gesture like that would sweep her off of her feet. Remember, first impressions are very important. And bout the text-msgs, the ratio should not exceed 2 msgs per week. but things could change when u get to really know her.  So, Good luck playboy ;)
zzLN7DbRaa	YOUR THA BIGGEST PUSSY I HAVE EVER HEARD LOL. Sike, i'm just playing with ya its cool to feel alittle scared of exposing your private parts to somebody.

CbrUuvDCaa	what do you mean 'messing'? If a girl likes you, she will give you signs, because it would be weird if she plainly said "i like you". Examples of signs include if she goes out of her way to talk to you, if she stares at you and looks away when you look at her; if she touches you, or wants to hang out with you|`|qFc8EqDsaa	if she flirts with the other guys right in front of your eyes,it will consider that she is messing up with you. if she interested in you,she gives all her attentions to you then.|`|hzKsyeRbaa	you never will    because people have the power to lie.    and it sucks|`|VvB9dnsjaa	i don't  know sorry =(|`|9876da77b658502b6299cabce239d243aa	Ask her.|`|5385f45a70dcab7bbb5e7da5f3034aeeaa	You could ask, but asking could either freak her out or maybe ...she would honestly answer you.    But for now a specific question would be nice though, since the definition of "Messing" could mean different things that can either be minor or major.    But for now Id suggest to play the game you think she is playing with you, reflect back how shes treating you, and if she bites I guess she likes you too.|`|cfQn2bdkaa	The only way i found works is to just flat-out ask because when i guess i'm always wrong.|`|Ej2Wg4Qyaa	if she flirts with other guys... she's just messing around... but maybe she likes u... at the same time she likes another 1000 guys ....pay attention ;)|`|MkqLMKMBaa	if she starts flirtin and shes hot ask her out lol  but if u dont like her dont but if you see her lookin at u when she thinks u dont see her then she mite like u  oh but if she is flirtin with other guys then she mite not like like you just keep a look out lol

Very funny though.|`|LcMNIM6daa	im talking to my husband while he is the  bathroom,it does not bother him if so ill be angry to him cause he answers cellphone calls even he's in the bathroom|`|V5tFbQpiaa	From this guy's point of view it doesn't make any difference to me unless I am on the toilet.  But that goes both ways - I don't try to start up a conversation when she is doing her thing either.  - My wife chimed in in the background saying that she appreciates me giving her space when on the toilet.    We do share the same shower and sink area (twin sinks) and converse often. when in those areas.

Im 22 now and was 14-19 when i use to do it. i remember there is nothing that would feel better than seeing the blood and feeling the razor cut into my skin.it sucks to know some one else feels this way. tell her she is to good and beautiful, and that you love her. if she ever goes through this when you are there HOLD her.LOVE her. Be her friend. find out what the real reason is for cutting herself. is it drugs? or boys? parents? friends? peers? all of those were my problem. it could be anything. be there for her and don't be mean. Make her feel beautiful Put make-up on her. Do her hair, things like that. She needs real love. If you Believe in God then pray for her to find Peace in her soul.tell God you want him to show your friend that he is there and that she needs him and he loves her. She will be ok. Im going to pray for your friend. Don't get me wrong i am Not a holy roller but i KNOW God has helped me get rid of that horrible feeling of needing to hurt my self. If you want tell your friend that there is a girl in california who is thinking about her and i don't know her but i pray for her. |`|ajaUpJ8Raa	ask her: wut does cutting your self help? it just makes scars on ur arm... it does not solve anything wuts so ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Tell an adult as soon as possible. Cutting is not healthy and it could greatly damage her forever. She might be mad at you at first, but it may save her life. You have to approach her and tell her it's wrong. Try talking her out of it first. But either way, you have to tell someone! |`|7sf3zt1Oaa	Uhmm, you could only hep a certain person if he/she acknowledges that he/she needs your help. In this case, I know that your concern for this friend is sincere but you can't really help her at all if you'll just push it. I'd say that you just have to let her know and be assured that you're always there for her no matter what. And there's still one great thing you could do for her, pray for her that if you believe in this...hope this could help!|`|YYLEf0CTaa	tell your friend to write songs or go to a gym with a punching bag so she can hurt her self by hitting and hitting and hitting the punching bag until she gets tired an can/t handle it ANY more and that urge to cut her self will go away
O3vJLPwiaa	Hopefully the other two children can spend the night with a family member so you have the house to yourself. Make his favorite meal like you said and keep some candles lit around the kitchen and living room. Rent his favorite movies or submit to watching his collection of Die Hard movies or whatever it is he is interested in, then just prop yourself up on the couch together and cuddle and talk about the new baby.    Romance tends to appear in situations where there is already love...it's not necessarily something you have to create.|`|b8b956b2b276b131498b783b5850e58aaa	Light candles and play music.|`|7F5l0gEgaa	you know "wink wink"

Es cierto que en algunas ocasiones puede que sintamos ganas de vengarnos de alguien, pero no es bueno hacerlo, no esta bien.|`|70982543de412c2e789590b09d312f64aa	Puede ser un arma de dos filos!!!

Tu decides!!|`|rVtlOc12aa	Por supuesto que no, es un acto que rebaja al ser humano. No deja nada bueno y es para gente sin valores.|`|0HvHVipKaa	Hola.  No, no es buena la venganza, de hecho desgasta mucho a quien esta pensando continuamente en el desquite.  Cuando te lastiman o te ofenden, lo mas recomendable es que enfrentes a tu ofensor de inmediato, le exijas una explicacin, pero hazlo de frente, cara a cara.  La venganza, es de cobardes, porque por lo general se busca hacer el desquite  por la espalda, con quien menos culpa tiene y eso habla del poco valor para enfrentar a quien consideras tu enemigo y es por lo sientes superior a ti en algn aspecto.|`|gshshxRwaa	creo que hay que diferenciar entre las personas que les gusta vengarse y entre lo que es bueno o malo, que te guste vengarte no significa que sea bueno, creo que la venganza es mala, pero a muchos nos gusta hacerlo|`|AA11463698	Quien mas que para conocerte que tu misma! es decir, si esto te hace sentirte mejor, pues adelante, Vengate! pero si eres como yo, que despues te vienen los remordimientos, ni hablar No lo hagas! porque lo mas importante no es el dano que causes a la otra persona, sino a ti misma al sentirte mal.|`|1348f6836a90e40cab62fdbf91395470aa	Todo acto tieje una consecuencia, a mi modo de ver, nadie merece que se llene de odio t corazn, todo a su tiempo se paga y sin tu ayuda,  suerte!|`|ac8d9e4300d63862e0a5d382a94587deaa	no la verdad no creo que sea buena y pues yo soy de las que piensa no hagas lo que no te gustaria que te hicieran ademas generalmente los que te hacen algo despues les va peor algunos lo llaman karma por eso amor y buena vibra para todos saludos!!!!!!|`|kn3JvZbjaa	No es buena, solo da?a tu alma y te da una mala experiencia, lo mejor es olvidarte de eso
85cja6A9aa	tony, you have to get her to talk to you try just saying hi or some other greeting you might be surprised. alsso try just walking with her or in class ask her for help in class but the key is to try and keep trying! good luck.old school is the best school|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Pretty much approach her with confidence. Its okay to be shy but you need confidence, it's an attractive trait. Then if your in the same grade you can start off seeing if you share the same teacher. Talk about that, or if you notice something about her talk about that.. Talk about things that you enjoy she may comment then you talk about that with her. Just ask her, questions , about music , movies, etc    But approach it as you want to be friends, to get to know her, then you have nothing to lose.|`|HN34kGhFaa	try talking to her if not face to face try writing to her and just tell her how you feel its the only way you well know how she well get to know how you feel about her|`|OO9KxvR6aa	If she is ever alone go over to her and ask if you can join her.  Approach her quickly or else you'll end up flaking out at the last second.   If she doesn't know who you are make sure you introduce yourself but AFTER you've asked her how she is!  Just make conversation about whatever's going on around you and then slowly move onto other topics.     If you don't know her you have ALOT to talk about.  Music  Subjects  Where she hangs out  Her friends  Your friends  Family  Interests.      You get the idea|`|AA11057445	If she's smiling and making eye contact with you, she probably wants you to make a mini-move and start talking to her.      The worst thing that's going to happen is that she's going to roll her eyes and tell you to go away.  So you do, no harm, no foul, but she sounds like a nice person and that's not very likely to happen.    You're in study hall together, so find some class that you guys both have, like Chemistry, and just ask her a question about school work.  That's always a great excuse to make conversation.    Just be nice and sincere and don't be too pushy.  Girls like when guys talk to them, though.  A little confidence can be very sexy.  And the first step is the hardest, I promise you.  After that, it'll be easier and easier every time.|`|1en1Jtp4aa	u should call animal control, then crime stoppers|`|SFIa9c7Xaa	ask her to go get some coffee? or food, or sonic|`|nPQjgdJxaa	just start a conversation with her one day about school work or something that happened that day, maybe you could eventually get to know her..  she probably won't be mean because if she's smiled at you without even knowing you, she must be a nice person!  good luck!
eEzDz4Pmaa	Just did a google search and got this one. There were dozens of websites listed, but most are probably sites that list other sites, which list other sites.....

jmtbtVYsaa	DO NOT EVER LOVE A MARRIED WOMAN.  All it does is destroy another family.  Leave it alone.  It makes you a loner if you can't find someone else to love.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Do not ever be alone with her.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Just be honest and tell her that although you like her that you have no interest in getting romantically involved with her.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	the best way to deal with this, without being a jerk. Is when she's making these moves, put your hand out to sort of stop her. then look at her and say, you are married. what do you think your husband would think about this.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	just move on you putz she can be a friend but you need a woman so get one|`|cGbTJobeaa	The only way you can avoid hurting her family is to cut off all contact with her.  Forget about the friendship. She is having an emotional affair with you and that is putting her marriage at risk.    Think about these great kids that you love to death and her awesome husband for a moment.  Do you really think that these kids would be better off in a divorced family?  If you have any doubt, read the pain in the words and questions of some of the posters here who are products of divorce. Quit helping this woman to jeopardize her marriage.    You will fall out of love with her much quicker if you abandon all contact with her. Don't worry about looking like a jerk. You are being noble for the sake of her kids.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Have some self respect and dignity, and WALK away.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Glad to see someone has morals.  I used to have morals, buts not I don't.  People do what they think they can get away with doing.  Have fun life is short.  BTW, if she really was so great she would be trying to cheat on her husband.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	I'd say that as much as it hurts, you need to get away from her.  I think your doing a great job in shutting off from sex, because once that threshold is passed, there's no going back, and you get sunk deeper and deeper.  You should really try to distance yourself from her.  It's not right she's having this close of a friendship with you, that alone is jeopardizing her relationship with her husband, do you know that?  She's having an emotional affair with you and she's trying to make it a full blown sexual affair.    You shouldn't be talking to her all the time, every time you do that, you pull her farther away from working things out with her husband.  She's using you as a crutch and a diversion from her marriage.   The best thing to do is avoid her.|`|1IweC4O7aa	Aristo Crap is right on the money.

62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Why cant you just state your reasons as an excuse? Are they selfish reasons?  It's okay if they are but if they are then I can understand why you would need to come up with a better excuse.  I say you show up for like 2 minutes and then have an emergency you need to run out for. Your friend was in a car accident -- got arrested -- a work emergency.  If you just don't' want to show up, you'll need to have a few people cover for you.  Eye witnesses to your stomach flu, food poisoning or serious bout of diarrhea.  You may have to say it's something embarrassing so no one asks questions...like hemorrhoids or you caught your willy in the zipper and had to rush to the ER.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I can't imagine a "good excuse" for not attending her 80th birthday party short of having to be hospitalized.|`|1Dj3JVftaa	tell your wife your so sick (throwing up and crapping) and stay in the bathroom until she leaves.|`|UYfsZAfraa	reasons:  - i have a very important meeting/trip/job/etc.  at that time!  - I really can't because i have the flu (sneeze here) oh dear and i don't want you to catch it. the doc said its very contagious.  - its snowing like hell here and my car can't move and theres no transport available now.  - sleep through it and say ur alarm clock was broken.  good luck!|`|lMZQJEsKaa	You're dying or flat on your back sick in bed?

SkeAJPWyaa	"Happy Birthday! You mean everything to me, and I don't know what I would do without you! So sorry I can't be there. Just remember that I [love you- if you have told eachother that..] "    Although you should write what is in your heart.   You should call him not text him, as I'm sure he will prefer that!
uzPC2Spwaa	First off, tell your friend not to talk to him. she doesn't help you in talking to him, she makes it worse, and harder for "bob".    second "bob" doesn't sound like he's ready for a relationship,  and frankly, you don't sound ready either.    in school boys try to keep up appearances. so no matter what he feels, he'll say otherwise to your friend, because he's not talking to you.    and when you ask him in front of other pple, he will keep up his appearances, and try to embarrass you, because he is embarrassed.    best thing you can do is give him your phone number..    if he calls, he's interested, if he doesn't. then he's not ready for a relationship and you need to move on.    good luck
sBBmChTfaa	You make a good point a really good point but think about this a life with out love is no life at all........ love is what we r intended to do and its up to u wether or not u want to love but i will tell you its the best feeling in the world to have but also your point is very good y go through the pain and suffering and the broken hearts but in the long run its worth it because if your really in love everything will work out in its own time and its a really beautiful thing to see because being in love has its up's and down's but the people that really care and that are really in love will hold on to that happiness even if it means going through the pain and suffering......

RLTQrmnMaa	Better to admit it. It sounds like it's eating at you. You'll feel better in the long run.|`|NtOhiM8Taa	go to confession and you will feel better.
wMVlfHLxaa	I think you're just going down the road for heartbreak sweetie! I know it will be hard at first, but you need to forget the whole love side of things. You should be loving someone who loves you back.  She only sees you as a friend, and said yes to someone else. You're just going to keep hurting if you continue to have feelings for her.  I think she was happy to see you cos her friend was talking to her again. But that's all.     Good luck and be strong!|`|H8FHx1HYaa	date other girl's,if she gets jealous she likes you|`|SxrY0oZPaa	you have to move on. do not be  a pushover. she is attracted to a MASCULINE man, remember that.|`|yRq1MhOsaa	dont treat her the same way, it would hurt her alot. she probaly doesnt even realize what she did. sometimes girls just forget, i no i do. talk to her about it and ask her out again, not on a date but just go to the movies or something as friends and after a couple of times ask if she maybe wants to go on the next one as more than friends. sometimes they just need some time to get to know you a little better before they take the leap straight into a relationship.  good luck, really hope you understand more.|`|07bba9a9416988f7dab40a24b7d6e1efaa	I think this is love at first sight:    She likes you for her company,when you fo that girls think that your mad at them, or you hate them.    But if she was happy to talk to you again..    You have to fight for what you want..i had the same situation with my bf..then i got him and he asked me out(it takes time,but it worth for what u waiting for)    You have to find her likes/dislikes. :)    complement her features like 'your eyes really stand out with that hair style')Beilieve me it works!    Good luck buddy

AA10026445	I'm 47 and wish i was still 27. I'm way over weight and wish i wasn't. Ive been dissabled from a neck and back injury and it took my strength away  and i want it back [maybe surgery will help ,all i can do is hope.  I was married for 23 years to man i loved and admired we had two wonderful kids together ,they are the good that came from the marriage  .and then  he turned my world up side down because he turned out to be a bisexuall transvestite that drank his own bodily fluids for sexuall enhancement [sick sh**  ha] and his hearts desire was to meet  some  [heshe ] that would pass as a real woman so no one would question his sexuality . and yes i would give up on what little i have left  to be with someone i could whole heartedly trust and love  [and almost did] because once you have loved and know the feeling it gives to know that your desired and they like having you in their life and you [know] the feelings mutual , you will always want it  for your self ,plus i never wanted or expected to be alone and i dont think its good for any living being to be alone. my wish is for  my heart to be unbroken  , i want  to get my strength restored , and then everything else will fall into place [ i hope ] .|`|a88c7ce0ae93e3c161f54fdbec330759aa	I have given everything in my life up for the one I love, but ultimately I have gained so much more. I quit drugs during our relationship and it was a very rough time for me and I seemed to of lost so much during that time, but in the end, I am living better. A lot of things happened between then and now. But I am a happier person with a healthier relationship and I am living a clean life, and today, I couldn't be happier.|`|963197406e15fd38b56764ae446e40c7aa	i want to answer the second part.  love is something really crazy, very hard to define and explain, even harder to ezplain what it does to us. i love my girl very much but just like me we two diffrenet individuals who get along and on  different level. so when it comes to giving up eveything for it gets tricky. i know i would sacrfice my PS to buy her her favorite dress of jewellery. but i believe in everything there is a limit to where we go and what we can do for love. this is because we are human. there is no use giving up everything so that i can be with my girl even if it mean we live under the bridge or by the corner. Love needs joy, happiness, hope, compasssion and many other things for it to flourish. i'd rather stay away from her that be with her only to be unhappy coz i am cold because i sold my jacket to be with her. its like asking will i take a bullet for her??????
1YSJHEDBaa	Candy has a point there, so thats a good idea and also perhaps change your phone numbers, just keep in mind that if she is mentally ill, she doesnt mean it, but i am sure you know that already and i understand you need your sanity. Perhaps even speak to her nicely and explain that callin too much is in apropriate and that you will call her on a certain and none other, something to that sort but deffinately speak to the parents to arrange something to be done.|`|AA12203913	Sorry to hear this.  I had friends like this but they weren't mentally ill....I had to distance myself, because the situation is not healthy for both parties.  Friends are suppose to be just that, talk go out chit chat. Stuff like that.  Once it gets to an obsession where one friend constantly is looking for the other friend.....RUN!!!!! very fast.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	If she's mentally ill, chances are you can't. You may want to talk to her parents about not calling you so much.
O7Ra6FxJaa	Read the book "Men are from Mars.." and you'll know to leave them alone. Its ok to listen but don't offer advice. They like to work out their problems on their own first. If its just a bad mood without a problem, still leave him alone to work it out. Or say "I can tell your having a bad day, let me know if you want to talk" and then make yourself scarce.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Run a hot bath for him and allow him to soak for a while.   If you really want to help a man out who is stressed and moody try making out with him.   It works like a charm.   He doesn't feel stressed anymore and the endorphines allow him to relax.   I know that some may think this method is silly but I promise you it works.|`|ItMUBNXgaa	When my husband is being cranky or moody, I say something like, "It seems like you're having a bad day.  Let me know if you want to talk about it."  Then I give him a little hug and walk away.  When/if he decides he wants to talk about it, I just listen.  I don't offer any advice or anything unless he specifically asks me because most times, guys don't want a women to "fix" their problem; they just need to vent.    Good luck!|`|rGStRem1aa	he's a happy go lucky guy.  sometimes he'll come home from work stressed, i can tell cuz he'll have a little furrow in his brow.  then he'll unload a barrage of fu cks and pieces of sh it for a few minutes, the brow flattens, then he's fine.  thats the extent of his moodiness |`|kGNTWtwEaa	well usually guys in general dont like to chat about there problems. What i would do is ask them do u want me to leave the room for a lil bit so that way u can cool off? If they say no they dont want u to leave the room then mabye your guy just needs attention and needs someone to chat with.|`|fGE7hL12aa	When I am stressed out or moody, I just want to be left alone. There is nothing anyone can say to change it. I don't want sympathy, because that just makes it worse. I don't want to talk about it because that is like reliving whatever pissed me off.    If I can watch TV or read a book for an hour or so, I am usually fine.     (You may also want to keep in mind that sex does relieve stress.)|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Ok, when you try to sympathize and relate he gets pissy, there's the answer, leave him be to himself. He needs to work things out in his head and decompress, give him room.|`|5flmZ8kSaa	I have one of those!  Its not fun all.  what I do is ask him whats wrong if he says nothing then I leave it alone.  theres really nothing else you can do if he won't talk to you.  Guys are like that.  they don't like to talk about things.  they like to work through them on their on own.  Don't pry.  just leave him be.  your not abandoning him and trust me he wont feel like that.  if you keep prying he'll get upset even more saying that your nagging him.  just leave it be.  but if he continues the behavior then bring it up that you can tell that something is bothering him and that it hurts you that he won't talk to you about it.|`|KRE5oflKaa	I usually dont talk about it with him unless he brings it up.  When he does, I ask questions so I can understand better what he is feeling or thinking.  I try not to say "you shouldnt feel that way, its not your fault" because that diminishes what he feels.  he does feel that way and if he is expressing to you something, he doesnt need you to tell him he shouldnt feel a certain way.. .i learned that the hard way when his mom died.  :(      I felt for almost two years that I was walking on egg shells.  there is no way around it, but if you love the person, you will try to support him when you can and stay quiet when you can.  sometimes i dont know what to say to him, so i just listen and stay quiet.  I make sure i look at him in the eyes and acknowledge what he is saying.  sometimes the best thing for the person is just to listen.  if you live with him, support him by having the house extra clean, or his clothes ready for work, food ready when he gets home if he's usually hungry right away or just a cup of coffee in the morning.  little acts of kindness goes a long way to help lessen his bad moods or stress.      good luck|`|tivpa7Vlaa	honey men r different when it comes to stress they mostly like to be left alone..all u can do is just mention to him if he wants to talk about it u r there for  him and give him space. men would watch sports, play video games or just catch a movie. they have a way of pulling themselves out of a funk. don't bagger him with concern u r looking to get cursed out. just give him room. u r not abandoning him so no need to feel that way|`|TKNPveHDaa	A lot of girls answered this.  I'm a guy.  This is what we want.    1.  Leave us alone.  We don't need anyone to sympathize or empathize or give us emotional support.  In fact, abandon us completely.  Leave us to our video games and tv.  We don't want to deal with you or anyone else.      2.  Continue leaving us alone until we come out and decide we're better.  It won't last very long, guys get over stuff rather quickly.  But if you keep asking what's wrong or if we're okay, we'll get piseed.|`|8PVUPtu8aa	Just let him know that you're there for him when he needs you. |`|FU2a2WSiaa	Depending on what is making my husband so stressed out I try to talk to him... if that doesnt work and I feel like I have to "walk on eggshells" I just leave him alone til I feel it's "safe" for me to talk to him again. Sometimes trying to talk and get out what's bothering him makes the situation worse, and has us arguing... so I usually let him sort out what ever is bothering him. 
KRdFHH0Vaa	I'm a girl and I don't do that stupid crap (I'm 16). And if Zac Effron came up to me, I'd put him in a cannon and blast him off to freakin Mars. I could not care less about him. And right now, I don't really care about guys/girls unless they are willing to go with me and do the stuff in my life that is important right now.

U0IILY3Raa	Personally I would just ignore her for the most part.  If you start stooping to her level then she can complain against you.  If your other co-workers are also having problems with her perhaps you could all speak with your boss, separately or together? Also, you could start keeping a journal of her actions (and your re-actions - just in case it comes to "well she said this" scenario) with dates/times etc. That could help if you ever speak to your boss or depending on where you work you could speak to an HR person about her - depending on what she is saying it could be considered harassment.  I am under 30 and I don't think that type of behaviour in a workplace is appropriate at any age.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	just ignore her....shes young....i kno where ure coming from but if u let her kno she bothers u then she will keep it up...|`|hOjY5zrYaa	Ignore her. She's a child and that's why she acts the way she does. If you guys don't include her in your circle, she'll get the message.|`|Fc0ZR1hnaa	Well, we have to bend and be flexible  because the younger ones need jobs as well.  I would try to get along with her the best that I could.  Maybe once you get to know her a bit she may not be that bad of a person.|`|194b54187f1750fb22cf00609f480a41aa	Just ignore her. Sorry to say this but a lot of people that age are like that (I would know I've fired 6 in the 8 months at my job). Just ignore it, but at the same time make sure that the person in charge knows what is going on. This new girl probably won't last much longer. Ours don't. Many in that generation think that everything should be given to them and that they know all about everything, best bet is too ignore it.
a0Bmy0vPaa	i think that u need to talk to someone. i think the reason u resent men is because u see how your man makes u mad at his habbits and u figure all men are like that. i think u just havent found the right man who will show he loves u and not do things that would aggervate u. if u think seeking out a woman would fix your problems then go for it. i think the reason u may want a woman is because we are caring nice and listen and they would show u LOVE more. BUT being that u have kids i would really try to work on the realtionship u have with your man for them. If u feel there is no way it will ever work then do what makes u happy and feel loved.|`|3QG6WLXXaa	get counseling|`|v7P6Cqp9aa	Go with your instint . Dont waste your life , take chances ! .

d18db6b6556fc15f9eab2dedfce85c99aa	All I can say is that he might come back, but he might not!  This may sound stupid, but I think that everything happens for a reason and if he doesn't come back then I'm sure that that must mean there is someone better for you.  You may just not know it yet!  and you're only 14!  You still have time!!  Just trust me    |`|muhCqFpfaa	You're 14, I can tell you right now that this is not "the real love where you can really tell."  Also, long distance relationships are too hard for someone your age.  Just have fun with him and stop being so dramatic, at your age everything seems perfect but you still have a long way to go.  This kid claims that he doesn't want to be with "the same girl forever" but at your age it wouldn't last 6 months.    Don't you have barbies to play with?|`|5xm6pS2Saa	Okay first of all, you don't know what true love is if your only 14. He can see other girls if he wants to. And yeah, maybe he will come back. If what you guys shared was truly special, then he'll come back. Good luck! |`|BIzu7oMGaa	Move on. he might come back to you, he might not. but you cant spend your life waiting on something that you don't know for sure. Who knows you might meet someone else that could be the real deal. He isn't the real deal, If he was, he wouldn't want to see other people.|`|3bcC24obaa	I'm 31 and I'm answering because I've obviously been there done that. If he wants to date others you should to. Life is what happens while you are making other plans and if you wait till high school he may not be there like he says. It's better to experience other people now then to be together forever and then at 21 he wants to date other women. That would hurt alot more. If it's meant to work out it will and if not hang in there. There are more men that are going to enter your future than you can dream of right now. Have fun with your friends and remember you have the rest of your life to worry about this stuff.|`|801udhL4aa	You're young so you still have time to learn that long distance relationships aren't any good.  Someone's gonna cheat, and the relationship won't be strong.  And 99% of ppl don't fall in real long lasting love at age 14.  Most high school relationships don't last forever, just like middle school.    If he wanted to be with you then he would be.  If it were real love he wouldn't wanna be with anyone else, and wouldn't want to risk having you end up dating someone else.      My advice to you is move on.  Focus on yourself and try to catch lies when they start, before it's too late and you get hurt.  Use common since... oh wait, you're a young female... get advice from older ppl.|`|c5UAa65qaa	I hate to say it, but no, I don't think so.  It's true that very few middle school relationships survive, but most high school ones don't, either.  And a guy who hedges on using "official" titles and who wants to get more experience just isn't that committed no matter how old he is.  When someone wants to make it work in the long run, they make it work.|`|xtSucoY9aa	in my opinion he is not going to come back.|`|r2IgKewdaa	go for it...make it work|`|eXVWFo7qaa	first you name is awesome   Second since he is experiencing other things maybe you should to instead of waiting on him and if he does really like you he will get back with you  |`|mQw7JfCAaa	hmm...thats different. keep in contact with him, but make sure that you leave him wanting to talk to you more. maybe he will realize that he really likes you, and will come back.    answer mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...

bvwYVGJOaa	You're a very sweet caring boyfriend, i can emphasise with your g/f and i think you should encourage her to be confident about her body, & tell her you like everything in herself and her personality that made YOU fall for her.    You can call her sexy, gorgeous, or smack her @ss, pull her to you, lol you know its flirting and she might feel good about it too. Just spend more time with her than her with her sister. No one is perfect in this world, but if a person has a good heart and a good person, they are very rare to find and that is you and your g/f individually who are lucky to meet each other in this lifetime..|`|WAEDIWz8aa	awwww thats so sweet. tell her what uve said to us.|`|yr1685V1aa	thats sweet well im not sure lol just tell her|`|9CUaikUEaa	tell her that shes gorgeous and has a great body,and to totally ignore her sister. you need to let her know that you wont be disappointed and you would rather have a sex life.|`|EE7sAaMlaa	tell her that her sister must be jealous and shes hottest sister lol! that is sure to help, dont talk to her like softly and aw hun ur beautiful because altho thts reli sweet to make her reli belive it just go ova board and be like - 'wth! ur the hottest thing ive eva seen blah blah, all the guys think so...' it will give her such a confidence boost tht way.
ycNxVrUfaa	I agree. Women AND men need to accept responsibility for their own cheating. Women and men who claim they cheat because they weren't treated right are just trying to justify adultery. It's a way of trying to assuage their guilt.|`|BC1XNijIaa	In 2009 women want it and can get it just as much as men. You are generalizing.  Did this happen to you?

No. Then again you have to look at the situation and whom ever cheated, yes, is the piece of sh*t, because they're the one who lowered their self to cheat instead of changing the situation. And you hear about guys more because, lets face it, guys get caught more. Yes women like sex just as much as men and some might even cheat just as often but not all. Women hold love very close to them and most times would rather talk out a problem and find a solution then go out and cheat on their guy. Guys dont like to talk they just find someone else to make them happy. Sometimes its the other way around but I havent seen that much.|`|GUgzfks9aa	well because its easier to blame someone else ..|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	It is much easier on the self-esteem (mistakenly) to blame other people or things, instead of being responsible.      "It isn't my fault" is evident everywhere, including the justice system, at work, at the corner market, and at home.      It isn't my fault that I believe this.      PS   Women and men seek attention and affirmation.  It is normal.   Setting boundaries and living within them, is difficult.

krQiDGCHaa	I'd enjoy it.    You should be more worried if he decided he no longer had much interest in sex -- that would most likely mean he were getting it elsewhere.  However, since he's so ravenous for you, that is obviously a positive thing.    A.) If he were getting it elsewhere, why would he be wanting and needing you so badly?    B.) He is obviously very attracted to you, considering he seems so "insatiable."    Run with it, girl!  Congratulations. :)|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	enjoy it for all of us who get none...|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Does he ever call you by the wrong christian name during these periods of enjoyment?|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Enjoy it of course coz  you  never know  when it will stop and then you'll be worried  why  he  doesn't what to do it anymore.|`|5JxYYkazaa	Ask him why.  He might have something weighing on his mind (this depression maybe).  If he has a justifiable reason, don't be worried, just enjoy it.    If he doesn't have a good reason or it seems kinda flaky, I would be worried a bit.  Ask him if there is anything different he would like to try.  Or, bring up the conversation with something new you would like to try.  Then ask him if he has any ideas.  If you don't have any new ideas yourself, honestly, look up some porn sites.  Not only will you both get new ideas, it will stimulate your sex drive just by watching.    So really, either way, this is good news!  You're going to have fun no matter what!|`|dprURFLxaa	Enjoy it!

AA10379306	Wow what an interesting story. Umm a little confusing but I think you should just wait it out for a bit until you are DEFINITELY sure that she likes you. Because if you go for it and she doesn't like you, then the situation will probably be awkward. Maybe wait til she actually gives you her number. I really hope she likes you though, that would be a cute little ending to the story.|`|nO2vflnPaa	I'd just go with my own instincts on this one.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	you fool if you loved her at first sight don't go to fast first slow then break the bomb on her, i am sorry for the way ii acted but i mean i am a fool and you make me seem smarter.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	Holy crap, you're being a stalker. She's tried politely to get you to get off her case (not giving your number, escaping to the bathroom, offering to hook you up with someone else) and you keep coming back. Stop it. Move on. She's not the one for you.|`|STHD0k83aa	i dont think she knows you enough to like you.  get to know her better.  dont act so desperate (no offence)  :)|`|oaiL6vnuaa	chop of your dick cause you're not a man if you think this much about this $hit and type that long as $hit question about it, you've lost your dick priveleges.|`|h7YMKNI4aa	be friends for longer.  you'll probably go off her.|`|wy7GYq8faa	oo oo go for it !  definitely !!!  =)|`|Ej5ykFwYaa	She obviously likes you.

Good luck .And if your spending alot of time feeling bad about somthing just leave it. There are alot of girls out there.|`|p4ijP6ojaa	ok   1. you wrote TOO much!  2. I can only assume you are not TOO cool cuz who puts this stuf online  3. OK now for your question well i think she does but i know girls and i know that she is prob getting tierd of u and if he didnt like LOVE you from the moment she saw you, she prob. dont like you enough to ever be SERIOUSLY interested BUT you could have a shot BUT from what it sounds you sound desper8 in a way sooooo and girls ALWAYS want what they think you dont so, i am not aying dont act interested b/c if u dont, she will think you are not BUT you have to sound like you could eaily move on...     4. p.s. dont be offended by what i said earlier cuz i mean i wasnt trying to be rude, just myself... :]|`|c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	Just be friends for now, she is probably making up excuses not to give you her number.  I think she does like you, but she just doesn't know you that well.  You could hang out at lunch, or hang out at a school basketball game or something.  Wait for a couple more weeks before you ask for her number again or she may get creeped out...|`|fef9fzxYaa	ok ur scaring her prob ..how long do u know..2-3 weeks..u ight wanna slow down...like after 3 -4 months ..at least ..wait..n then if she still doesnt then u can go confront  her n tell her...otherwisse maybe ..u r better friends..i dont give my number like that...only after a couple of weeks..if we talk alot..n just wait..maybe she doesnt like u..dont chase her..otherwise u wont catch her..let her come to u|`|Xqo3cvNmaa	Hmm..I really think that you should talk to her about how you feel. That mostly always works!  Good luck!

EFJkic1naa	First of all you have a great boyfriend who will wait for you. Honestly what I've been doing is just oral sex because it pleases both of us and we don't have to worry about getting pregnant or losing my virginity. We've come close many times where my bf just wants to put it in and when I can tell he wants to, I get this werid feeling inside that reminds me, no I'm not ready for this. I always wanted to lose my virginity making love so I would feel werid every time he wanted to put it in when we were just fooling around. So I'm not sure if that "werid" feeling tells you you're not ready or if its just me wanting to lose it in a special way. So either way I'm going to tell you not to rush it. Also make sure you know his sexual history. HOw many sex partners he has had, etc. Because there's an STD called HPV that cant be diagnosed in men. Meaning there could be so many guys out there who have HPV but no way of finding out. HPV can cause gential warts or high risk cancerous strains. Sorry to be educating you about HPV but it's the only std that you cant test in men and cant cure. Talking from a friend's experience who only had sex once and got this hpv virus that can be spread even if you wear a condom. Be safe! It only takes one time to get it.|`|1d4b10950077343727e09fc6c9511961aa	you should wait.  obviously you are not ready if you are asking other people  and most people aren't ready anways  having intercourse DOES CHANGE THINGS    believe me when i say you won't regret waiting|`|ErsiccDCaa	actually very simple  if u feel like he is the 1 tat u love very much n no 1 else ull love like how u love him then go for it...  like me...i had 2 bf b4....i din wanna let the 1st 1 do it to me coz i noe i dun have tat much feelings for him  but the 2nd 1 is the 1 i love so much until im over cared about him more than myself...  i nv regret for having it with him  seriously nv regret even tho he wanna dump me now  but dont over do it...be safe too, get condoms k|`|3Tt3mUJCaa	go for it but use a condom|`|jaKYoc3kaa	Think long and hard the question " to get a possiable pregnancy or not to get a possiable pregnancy that is the question"|`|LDMJueQzaa	tell him in a nice way.  just say im not ready yet.|`|TnnHswx7aa	people always regret their first time. just wait until you really want to do it and are no longer indecisive.|`|H1S67gvFaa	Well, if you don't feel like your ready, you will feel this weird feeling inside of you. And you will be telling yourself your ready when your not. You know whats right and whats wrong, only yourself can decide wiether or not your ready. Trust me...if your not ready you will know.    P.S  If you tell him you dont want to do it, and if he really loves you, he will respect that. don't let pleasure get the best of you. Tell your boyfriend that if you both wait till your older then it will be more pleasureable. seriously, take my advice...tell your boyfriend, and listen to your mind. Do what YOU know is right.|`|5jkVqyhMaa	Lots of girls regret doing intercourse on their first time and on you first time it will really not be a pleasure for you because it will hurt and not simply hurt but hurt a lot and may delay your period so i recommend to have intercourse when you're ready for it.

dadcc56f57dd4073893287d32efd5bf7aa	just be yourself and let him see your good side|`|fbrdhY1aaa	First of all, don't change anything about you, because the one thing you change might just be the one thing he likes.  Um...I suppose you should watch him closely.  If he flirts with you more than he does with this other girl, then he likes you.  Maybe you should get yourself alone with him and the other girl and see who he gives more attention to.  If he hangs on your every word, he likes you, but if you feel like you have to struggle to keep his attention from her, then it's the opposite.    Oh, and if you want to know how to make him like you, you should talk to him about his taste in girls and see what he likes.  Then, if you felt like you had to, you could change what you needed to to make him see you.      (I do not agree with the method above because you should never ever change anything about you just to make someone else like you because you'll end up unhappy with yourself in the end, but you asked what it takes, and that would most deffinitely work)    Good Luck.|`|AA11573606	just be yourself if he doesnt like you for you then forget him|`|8K2BfvC5aa	Make sure you look nice always (maybe nicer than the other girl).

gvfYtmuRaa	I'm not sure. But if you want to know and not ask him outright, just be like, "so is there anyone you're interested in?" That should send a vague signal that you like him, which might up his courage to ask you out. Also, if he refuses to tell you, it means he's shy but likes you. If that doesn't work, later say that you've heard some rumors as to who he likes. When he asks who it is, you could either say that since he won't tell you, you won't tell him, or you could just say that you've heard he's interested in you - and make sure that you say it softly and smile, so it doesn't seem too scary for him. Good luck!!    If you could help me, too, that'd be great!!! http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

I've tried to act like it doesn't bother me, but it really does. I think he likes me also cause he seems to make his way nearer to me all the time and spend lots of time with me.  My advice: follow your heart because what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. Good Luck!|`|AA11178611	yup he's probably just trying to make you jealous and playing games...or he's just a huge flirt.

So you know his eyes are on you
XAl6Ff3eaa	Awe! Poor guy, but that sounds hilarious! I wish I could have been there! But, anyway, I guess you could have stated how you totally missed & didn't mean it. Although, I'm sure he knows that. That might have been one of those situations that we just get humilated and there's nothing we can do to avoid it. We all have had it happen to us one way or another. And it ALWAYS seems to happen when we are around certain people we want to look good for. I had a hot guy pull up to my house when I was standing on a truck bumper when I jumped off to greet him, my pants got caught on the ball of the bumper & I landed like a pancake on the ground! I was mortified, but laughed it off. Tell him this $hit happens, to all of us!|`|6KX5ptVaaa	I would knee myself your son in the balls!|`|cIZFf0rUaa	Sounds like you should act a little more like his mom and not a teenage girl.|`|IzY86r2paa	you could have asked your friend to give him a massage|`|f7435fe77b0447356cd1c464ed815131aa	maybe would have been better to not kick him in the balls in the first place theres a thought.  afterwhich humiliating him in front of your friend was a real class act.  how about you do something else like pull out his baby pics when he was getting a bath and show them around to his friends, or better yet make him drop his pants and show all your other friends how and where you blasted his balls into his stomach|`|wfnirWNQaa	That is really hilarious, sorry..  first of, you shudnt have joked at all with a butt kick   you shud have apologized rather than crack the joke [ seriously thats freaking funny, i know sounds mean butt..sorry]|`|vcgz0EaYaa	You probably shouldn't have made a joke. apologized and that sort of thing.  teenage crushes on older people are hard enough without thinking your parents are making fun of you in front of them. I'm sure he'll get over it if you just say you're sorry and tell him you didn't mean to embarass him.

Asi que yo siempre me fijo en el interior que al fin y al cabo es con lo que vas a convivir, no sirve de nada estar al lado de alguien "guapo" si no te entabla tema de conversacin, no sabe hacer nada etc.  Aunque ya se que hay gente que lo tiene todo, guapo, inteligente pero enfin que eso no viene al caso, que siempre hay que mirar el interior de las personas que hay gente maravillosa por descubir.

I've been with my guy for ten years, and we were each other's firsts. Even though we are still together 6 years after the first time we made love, I know that if anything ever happens he will always have that peice of my heart.     There's a difference in making love, and having sex. Making love is passionate, and with someone you care about. That person wil have a peice of your heart that is serious, a memory that will always bring a sense of love to your heart.    Sex, your first time, sure yu will always remember him, but if it was just sex, and no feeling... the peice of your heart and the feelings you share, those are completely different.

You can write a little note inside each present too or hide them and send himm on a treasure hunt - sounds kiddy but fun!!! Trust me!!|`|ytMpRueeaa	you could buy him a cool electronic like an iphone or something and if that dosent work you can always surprise him with a romantic evening wink wink

kTFJ3h3eaa	Yeah defintley dont ask a guy out its a way big turn off for guys. Also guys hate when girls call themselves fat. Just talk to him and be yourself like you would to one of your close guy friends and he might catch on and if he doesnt like you than you werent meant to be together.|`|pBRXVXmtaa	first thing...DO NOT ASK A GUY OUT! its a major turn off.
by9CBOAUaa	YOU JUST  think you love her, cause she doesn't want you.  You need to let it go. Find someone who will love you the way you love them.  Look at Gone with the Wind - she finally realizes that this goof she thought she loved, actually loved his wife.|`|3ZnaMsiXaa	if you know deep down in your heart that she really does'nt want you then you must wean yourself away gently. try not to spend so much time around her, and make sure you are busy doing other things. get yourself a new hobby that can take you a way from her. it may be you just want what you cant have. try doing other things and break a way from the life you have with her.|`|cFtDL9oYaa	well i think if u like her build the connection u guys had three years ago.and just go for it.

NKNVGxn8aa	she's just trying to get your attention.  she wants you to approach her. and talk to her.  she obviously likes you.  so take a chance and go talk to her!  she might just have a crush on you!|`|EjaXFBy7aa	Perhaps she is your sister, or a relative of yours.       Or maybe she wants to merely make you jealous and attract your attention.    Be a man, and go talk to her. Get to know her!
7PliMgXKaa	a litte bit, yes. alot of girs actually find it easier to have guy friends then girl friends, so dont give her a hard time.. but if she blows you off to hang out with some of these guys then i would ask her whats up.|`|cFtDL9oYaa	well dude u need to let go and face the fact that she can talk to other guys and its not called over protective its jealous!|`|omeGcTRfaa	catch em early, man   change em easily then
gHIgypdEaa	Why can't you all get together and tell her she's dressing inappropriately and making you uncomfortable, and she won't be invited to any more family events until she improves.|`|57LFRfqCaa	If it is worrying members of your family so much, stop looking at her body and look at her face!!    Obviously your family is very conservative and she is dressing as any other woman of that age.  She is probably also stirring the pot a bit, ie, if you didn't show so much obvious discomfort then she would probably ease up a bit.|`|56d781c1647103261e023c6f5e6ea13baa	Ew.... she's into incest.|`|gXzKuELCaa	She's seeking attention, she wants people to talk about her, maybe it could be addressed at a family meeting without her, like if she doesn't dress appropriately, she shouldn't be allowed to come, because she is making people uncomfortable.|`|7oHaOek8aa	well, maybe her mum can talk to her?someone has to talk to her..|`|sZPmROMoaa	Appreciate someone who dresses appropriately. How nice, Better covered, good manner etc.     She will understand your choice.    If she does not, in next gathering speak bad about someone who is not present but is not dressing up appropriately - low cut blouse, no underwear etc....

I think there are lots of different ways to express your love for someone. Sex is really only a small part in it. There are some people who can go their whole lives without sex... ( id like to congratulate them! lol) Im not one of those people btw xx
szVvf7Nkaa	You need to talk to your mom. I'm a mom and I would never let the oldest chid babysit the children because this is not my child's responsibility. Your mom has to understand that the 3 other kids are hers and not yours so she should take care of it. Don't be hard on your mom because she could be going through a tough time right now. But tell her that babysitting is affecting your school work. Also tell her that it's important for you to be with friends. Remind her how important it is for you to go out from time to time. Maybe you and your mom can work something out that she may just have to  get a babysitter from time to time so you can have more freedom to do different things. And if this does not work then and if she refuses to meet you half way. Or if she says it's your duty to help her out then talk to your school counselor about this. I know you love your mom and she loves you but she cannot force you to babysit the children. She has to understand that it is her responsibility to care of her children. She is the one that has to deal with the children and not you.|`|AA11006063	You asked two questions.  If you have to do the homework.  Tell your teachers the problem and make an arrangement at school whereas you can stay and do your homework, uninterrupted there.  Then have the guidance counsellor or teacher phone if your parents object.  (sometimes parents are too self absorbed and don't really understand their kids issues as real problems.)  As for not letting you go out, that is another thing.  Everyone compares their friends and says, 'but so and so gets to stay out til ten o'clock'.  (that never cuts it in the adult world)   There is a saying that kind of goes like this.....If you can't talk to your kids about the little things in life, why would they come to you with  big problems?  Maybe its time you took little steps in that direction.  Start by saying to your mum when she gets home from work, "How was your day?"  "You look a little tired, can I get you something?"(surprise her)     I am sure she dosen't take your babysitting for granted.  She has a lot on her mind.  The next day carry on from the previous days responses.    Remember this.  The bond you are creating with your brothers and sisters now, will be a support system when you are all older.    I hope you take my advice.  and I truly hope things get better for you.|`|Kbv6kxWSaa	babysitter! or tell her she made the kids she looks after em. lol|`|LvdYLPn1aa	Just tell her that fair enough she is busy with work, but you need to focus on your school work to get good grades for a good job. Or you can tell her that you don't mind looking after your siblings but you want time to yourself so you can go out with your freinds.    I hope thats the type of help you wanted, sorry if I didn't get it right!|`|LBx52tkVaa	I don't think you will be able to babysit, get good grades and go out with friends. One has to go and that is definately not good grades. what i think you should do, babysit your mum's children, cos if your mum get sick or something and she can't work, you don't have money to live. So i think you should babysit and reduce your mum's pressure. Plus babysit is not that bad, you will have a closer relationships, but i you are really concentrating on is get good grades, good job and support the family.|`|sZPmROMoaa	you have your life to mend. Ask your mother to hire a babysitter.     Your education is very important.|`|qL4CFMHraa	Explain how you're feeling.  Hopefully she'll hire a babysitter or something. Or pay you! That'd be an up-side, lol.  Hope it all works out.  X|`|hDM9EmgXaa	She probably is so caught up in her work that she doesnt even realise that she is stopping you from working.   I am sure if you talk to her and explain the situation then she will get it sorted.... after all thats whats mums do isnt it, x|`|zvdz8Cyaaa	Sit down with your mom and say "mom can i tell you something without you getting mad" And if she says yes then tell her that, you need to study and you can't look after the kids. And then get your friend and ask her if you could study at her house.|`|wGt0CCH0aa	I've been in that situations be4.I have sent my sister to school be4 i go on my way to school.There were times that my teachers got mad because im always late.But i just laugh because i know they know and understand the situations.My mom and dad were seperated and mom has to do all the things alone including household choirs.She works from 7 to 5.Imagine how difficult it was for me then?Iam doing all my moms obligastions...cooks,washing cloths ect...But i never said anything to my mom,because i understand her...because i love her.Anything i can help would mean a lot to her because she needs us...as inspirations..as her love..the way i needed her too..as our superwoman!So,now that your mother needs you...pls...pls...she will not ask you to do anything if she knows you cannot do it..Shes only teaching you on how to do household choirs...take the opportunities.Love your mom!mother knows best...really.learn to appreciate even the little things she's doing for you...
9slxGD18aa	here are some tips that may come handy;    This is no game, this is life and this life is real, it's no joke.   Grab you pen and paper, list all good things about him and all bad things about him.    List all the reasons why you broke up with him and see u can fix them. Then list all the reasons why you want to get back with him and see if the look logical to your self.    I was and am on logic side, because most of the times emotion does not work, so use your brain.    See a counselor if you have to.  Then if the result tells you to get over him, i would tell u to hang out with another guy (dont make it look serious to him unless you wanna), it will take off some preasure.    Hope it helped|`|Oh6KZKQhaa	go out with your family or friends. focus on what you love to do say a hobby or  your career. its not easy but when you meet someone that's the only time you'll realize that there is someone for everyone. only time will tell for now...|`|19a4d32d66187a5d8ead3af9a0fbd880aa	I'm pretty sure that being by yourself is the worst way to forget what's on your mind....you need to replace the memories of him with new ones. The only way to forget him is get another boyfriend. If you really want him back...then you'll have to be ok with the problem that made you guys split up.|`|687aa972e615ca57476bcd9f2a941d08aa	I don't understand.  If you feel this way why did you split?  Perhaps he will feel the same and things will be ok again.|`|SQ3RZAtSaa	just try to not think of him i know its going to be hard i was in the same situation just try being by your self or with some of your bestfriends|`|RZ4kCtV4aa	You may be interpretating the "always thinking about him" as despratardo (not to be mean)...but someone better, might not be there infront of you atm, so hes the only one you can think about.  Just because you had a long relationship with him, doesnt mean you cant with someone else.  Try something different!  Just wait, you'll find someone better, whos right for you, and reconizes you as his special girl, that he'll never ever want to let go!  Good luck! :)|`|mrvhMiSWaa	awe, that must be really hard. all you have to do is go out and have fun! get ur mind off of him. go drink ur night away (on the weekends only of course, and no driving!) it will be hard, but it IS possible.. go to clubs.. flirt with guys, i'm sure it's going to feel really fun to flirt with guys! so, see if that helps! bc usually that IS the best, and fastest cure to a broken heart! good luck!|`|j7q5ydI1aa	Wow! 5 years when you are 16-21 is not something you will be able to get over. You are stuck with him unless you want to be super unhappy for about 1 year.    After a year of not talking to him you will be ok, but I really doubt you can make it that long without calling him or answering his call.    Good luck!|`|dd13b26b588e610946fd9d25aca84ad5aa	If you feel that He's really the one for you, then go. But, still, think of the reason why you broke up with each other. Everything happens for a reason.   If you want to get over him, make yourself busy, you're too young to just think of your past.   Of course, when we are in love, we always think that that relationship is our one great love. However, everyone of us has only limited time to each other, just think that your mission to each other is over. 5years is really a big foundation, but think of yourself than anyone else.
oCYx6mWmaa	my cousin's boyfriend asked my cousin at school first hour over the announcement board. At their school they have a projecter in every room that they can operate from the office and her boyfriend is the operater for it and he made a slide and stuck it in there that said "(my cousins name) will you go to the Prom with me?" and then he came in to the room and she was just in shock. But he had to okay it with office and principal. When she called me and told me about it I thought it was the cutest way EVER to ask a girl to prom!|`|HAIQCjcEaa	Umm try flowers and a card. For a little extra you can send chocolates too.|`|PNl42AK5aa	I do not know where u live but if you are near a really unique museum, omni-theater or an aquarium that would be neat.  If she accepts, go to their gift shop by yourself, pick out a gift and on prom night when you give her the corsage you can present your memorable gift to your friend.  She will have a cool story, a great keep-sake and  the most thoughtful friend.|`|3YV1ZVUSaa	go, hey want to go to the prom|`|0BPVlHR9aa	Here's my best advice based on hard-won experience:    Invite the gal you want to invite, not the one you think people will think you're cool if you invite.    Then just go up and invite her.  Wait too long and she might have to say she wanted to go with you but accepted an earlier invitation from someone else.    Cheers.|`|ExFna7ILaa	Okay take her to a movie then sneek the tickets into the popcorn and when she takes it out just be all like wow that give you any ideas or take her to a park and rent a horse downtown and write it on something.|`|eqDjKROzaa	OMG, so last year i wanted to ask a freshman to prom and I was so nervous. We were at a show choir competition and sitting in a classroom. I picked up a piece of chalk and asked "Hey, do you want to play hang man?" The answer was "Will you go to Prom with me?" it was sooo cool! Best of all... THEY SAID YES!!!!|`|rgPboQCzaa	if you are a funny guy...make her laugh.   go get a bow tie and put a note on it for her and leave it where she can find it. A note like "here is your assignment. find someone named (your name)...it's imperative that (your name) wears a tuxedo with this tie to a prom in the next month or the school will explode. You need to be there with him to make sure he doesn't take it off...well, before 11 pm anyway...uh, ok, back to the desperate tone of my note....if you don't find (your name) today and get him this message, the tie will self destruct....hurry!      another idea..if she doesn't go for that kind of humor is to put a fake ad in a paper, or make an ad up and print it out for her, like:    Good Friend Seeks Other Good Friend for Prom Date  Fun, nice guy would like to find a girl out there with the name (her name) somewhere in the city that he could escort to his prom. She must have the name (her name) or it just won't be any fun for him. Please call him at xxx-xxxx.    anyway, this might take the stress out of asking her...incase there is a "no thank you" in your future.    otherwise...live it up, have fun and make sure to laugh all night.|`|eCflT5Bdaa	Wow, that is very sweet that you thought about wanting to make it more memorable for her! You sound so creative already! I wish someone would have thought of that for me. Just a considerate guy like you going with her to prom will make it memorable. Try this: Tell her that you want to ask a girl to prom, but you are heartbroken because you don't even know the girl's name. Ask her if she could tell you if she knows the girls name based on your description of the girl. Pull out a list of everything you like about the girl , physically and personality wise-(Of course this description would really be a description of your friend that you are planning on asking). Maybe she will catch on  or maybe she will have no clue--she might even be a little jealous at first:)    * Good luck! Update us on how you actually invited her to prom later on!!
rHsAcDBtaa	you get close friends when you invite them over, so ask them what club they go to, or if then wanna shop, or even have a SLUMBER party. call them and if you need on HW and you know stuff like that!!    don't worry, you always have a close friend in your heart, weather its your mom or dad or God or anyone!|`|95J2zTS3aa	Just be friendly.

SE PONE NERVIOSO    3) Si le llamas en la noche.. digamos a las 9 que es la hora de cenar o quiz de estar en el cine.. o en algun otro lado.. puede que no te responda.. o no vaya a verte si se lo pides como algo especial.    4) No el cae a tus amigos o de plano te dicen que el tiene a alguien mas... tu no lo crees de primera.. pero cuando la duda est en ti es porque algo hay.    5) Haz caso a tus intuiciones y si no te llena una relacin dejala ya.. o te terminarn dejando o quiz.. la novia te contacte y te cuente todo.    Si estas en un error... entonces tienes problemas de celos.. jaja en fin... hombres.. hombres...|`|90Ttf8Edaa	Pues yo pienso que tampoco puedes suponer esto y hay veces en las que tienes que creer, pero bueno, yo creo que si un chico tiene interes en ti, busca frecuentarte lo mas posible, siempre buscara un pretexto para verte o estar contigo, contarte todos sus problemas, hablarles de ti a sus amigos, etc. Pero si el no se aparece seguido, siempre te inventa cosas o pretextos para verse o lo sientes a veces nervioso o que esconde algo, es probable que no seas la unica.

J9DgHjceaa	Depends on the situation and other details going on in the relationship. Sometimes you don't need a reason to break up with him, If its not working out between the 2 of you then why lie to him and say you like him still just to make him happy?     You will eventually have to tell him how you feel towards him.   For instance.. You may "love him" Or at least think you do, but sometimes if you two are fighting or just don't have a lot in common and barley talk, then what kind of relationship is that? You should just end it ad find someone you are compatible with :]    Hope this helped Hun.

68fe10fe9cd7ce3be9e90712f89e2758aa	I say, you should have a picnic :]. Bring out a big blanket and lay it in the grass under the shade. And if you go to a park with a pond, maybe you guys can feed ducks together. You can go to the grocery store and buy some bread and other materials and make sandwiches. Its really cheap and fun. And it can all fit inside a basket. You could also bring cards or board games also :D.|`|ICNZbgl5aa	One idea is to go to the beach. Watching the ocean can be very relaxing and very romantic. There is so much great things that can be done at the beach. You can lay on a towel, go for a walk or find a little secluded spot just for the two of you.|`|q93CKSWwaa	Movies, picnic, you choose it.
AA10647210	Being shy makes things really hard on you I know. Especially the feeling of Rejection. But here's ways of doing this.    ** Tell him the truth if not then go to the next  ** Go out and make hints to him if not then  ** Tell him hey you know we've been friends for a long time, and what would you say if i said that i have feelings for you?  .  Secondly, He's a guy, if he's not taken then 99 percent of guys usually fall for their best friends too they just don't tell you. He might be in the same boat as you.|`|jFeVJFLWaa	well if you like the suspension, take your time and flirt with him ..maybe he will end up fallin inlove with u if he isnt    or if you just want to really find out what he feels about you, just talk to him  chances are he likes you too|`|7bqSBJodaa	I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself  is life worth living should I blast myself?

Hope that helps|`|Db0iIbsJaa	find out if he feels the same 1st by saying and asking things indirectly?...n giving out hints....    no point making a move and him saying no 2 u...then u can end up lossin a friend too    omg lolll the 1st guy who answered ur question must b a tupac fan wooohoo i thourt they all xtinct    MAKAVELI    LIVES    ONNN
lk9bMaz6aa	it is worth the trip!!! it's the happiest place on earth baby!!  and if you don't like it, at least you had the experience, i think you should go either way, but i really think you'll like it (it's like a necessary life experience, sounds lame cuz it's disney land and isn't significant, but i believe if you can do something that's fun, then it's worth it, and if you don't like it, then at least you know you don't like it, you never know until you try and at least you had the experience) (sry if my explanation doesn't make sense, it's hard to explain...)|`|kC7kBwvEaa	Nope, ive never been there either     *cry cry* I wish i could go    good luck    =]|`|nI3eZG1faa	my kids thought it was over rated...they actually liked sea world better...more to do|`|gQpswYdsaa	Yes yes yes. It is the best place ever!!! It is way worth the trip.|`|BlhxtyCUaa	I guess it's worth the trip just to say you've been there and it's something everyone should experience, but to be honest, I didn't think it was that fun. Just extremely expensive. But the choice is yours!|`|awIArWe8aa	Absolutely!|`|G6Xsdu0Gaa	yes it worth it.  I have been there twice. I list everthing you can do there. I got to say this.  At downtown Disney there is a tall building which you have to enter with a credit card, debit card or disney card. I don't remember what card, but there are thousands of games there on 3 floors.  The neat thing is there all free to play. no change needed.|`|jwubXU2Maa	Yes! You should go....    I love it so much that I dragged my husband there while we were dating, and he liked it so much that he begged to go there on our honeymoon!|`|406b3fb25ff0e68a178b23ef5d3cb702aa	Yep. My first time going was in Oct. 2006. It was the best! My family and I stayed in one of the Disney Resorts. But, if you want to save money, then I suggest you stay in a hotel outside of the Disney World.|`|8VMAic3Aaa	yeah [:    Please answer my question people xD    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|EnG9Lg5Faa	The first time I'd ever been there was 2 summers ago (I was 16). We went to Disney World in Orlando and it was totally worth the trip. People associate Disney with children, but adults have a blast too.|`|aMFtAhkRaa	yes and no. its fun and kinda cool but its babyish and there are a lot of lines. its packed all the time especially in the summer|`|8b6LtkMiaa	well it isn't worth the trip but you might want to take your family there anytime. But if your busy than i suggest you shouldn't.|`|0cYtUMuiaa	it depends on which park and yea they are fun|`|TcXVZSBmaa	yeah. space mountain is awesome!!  and the indiana jones ride was way cool too.|`|BnGCrTKpaa	no its not its way to packed and the line for a ride is about 2-4 hour wate, i say go to disneyland or spend the moy o something more usefull...and funn!!!|`|81315015cad7dcff3ace8d43b6ad76a8aa	It depends how old you are and who your going with. If your older it won't be that exciting as if you were a kid but if you have kids it would be a blast.|`|Ey23HIrSaa	It's sooo worth it. Get the park hopper pass so you can go to california adventure too.|`|80VOatdyaa	u aren't the only person who hasn't been there  it is ttly worth the trip   i'm 13 and have been 8 times it never gets boring|`|zp5JZT2Naa	well sort of depends how old you are. if youre into rollercosters go or go to epicot if your not into rides, cause honestly for a teen theres not much else to do. but its just like american tradition to go, so why not!|`|k7a1W5fIaa	it depends. how old r u? or who r u taking? if ur taking kids between like 2-12 its totally worth it! if not then its just boring|`|nTbghjkHaa	I've been to Disneyland Paris twice. Yeah, it's not bad if you don't mind really high prices and huge crowds. Keep in mind if you like rides you'll be waiting at least half an hour to get on one.  But hey you only live once, may as well try it out. Be prepared for a big day!|`|GSSG6Cg9aa	Oh yes! It's definately an experience. You have to go, for fun, and just to say you went. It's so cool. If your going to DisneyLand vs. DisneyWorld, you'll want a Park Hopper Pass for California Adventure.    But I really think you need to go there. =]|`|nAKfPE9eaa	Depends on what you're expecting....  it's in the middle of a swamp and isn't cheap.  You really have to have a reason to go.  kids?  rides?  epcot?      I thought it was ok, but as a kid enjoyed Kennedy Space Center a lot more.    Probably wont go again till I have kids and if they really want to go.|`|f3429b5a162459c283b52abb7190de45aa	yes! i went when i was 15 ( so 8 years ago!) it was great! it did get tiring because there was just so much to do and the week we devoted to it didnt seem like enough time.  But yes it was just wonderful! Even the water parks were amazing it was hard to chose just one to go to! (thats all we had time for)|`|cf4CuDR5aa	of course!!!!!!|`|NZt7EM6Maa	Yes most definatly|`|F5PbRPIdaa	it totally worth it I'm going there this weekend|`|b901bDp4aa	yeah. it sucks.  it's a lot cooler when you're 6.|`|ZVnCdjtgaa	most definetly!  it's a bunch of fun.  :D|`|1TyFbEKyaa	YES.|`|uG5WCW4oaa	Yes.|`|af3618c3c438b0c88538a888bf12f6b8aa	Strong opinions.  People either love it or hate it.  Disney site has a free video.  Do you have children?  Disneyworld is lovely seen thru a child's eyes.   Like to travel?  Epcot is a flavor of foreign countries.  All in all, Disney tries hard to offer something for everyone.  disneyworld is too HOT in Orlando.  Plan a trip in the fall, after school starts.  Or skip the amusement parks, and check out the nightlife.  If you go, I hope you will like it.|`|ANSRH1BXaa	Everybody should experience that at least once.|`|q93CKSWwaa	Yeah, it's fun if you're into that kind of thing    Go next vacation if you get the chance|`|ASsciJ4Faa	No you are not the only person that has not been there. I know people that live in Florida and have never been there. Yeah it is kind of worth the trip, make sure you can go to every park, because it is a different experience at each one. Make sure you also go to Universal and Sea World. It is something that you do not want to do alone. It is is made for families and stuff like that.|`|12sJyAoBaa	totally

RtI8G0Nxaa	It sounds like he has some issues of his own, he probably does have a little crush on you but is afraid of your feelings toward him -- what I would do is simply do not act like you have a crush, be silly and cute, but also do the same things with other guys around him, don't let it seem obvious...    This guy needs to work out his feelings, its a waste of time and feelings if he just going to play games... |`|i433DORRaa	This dude sounds like he's confused, and a waste of time.

Don't freak out if he says he doesn't like you, and it shouldn't be a big deal because this is one guy out of many other cute guys.     If he hangs out with you and smiles at you when no one's around, and he ignores you in front of everyone, he's a jerk and you shouldn't try to get him. That means he doesn't want to be seen with you in front of others and that's not good.    But if he's playing hard to get or is shy, just ask him out or tell him that you like him too.|`|4JvieO06aa	My advise to u is find somebody that knows what he wants.

6wd1SWn0aa	Un poncentaje de grande|`|d5NN7ASOaa	Es parte. Una relacin no puede centrarse nica y exclusivamente en tener sexo, sexo y sexo, hay otros aspectos que son vitales como la comunicacin y la ayuda en momentos de necesidad como la enfermedad; o en problemas como estar en quiebra, que te meten a la crcel, te endeudas, etc., as como para encarar ese momento tan difcil para algunos: la vejez, y es que ac necesitas de alguien que te acompa?e al hospital, que te de la medicina, que te arrope y hasta que te entierre.     Por eso es que una relacin basada nicamente en sexo fracasa cuando ya no est su base: el sexo. Cuando ya no logras complacer a tu pareja, entonces esta busca otra.     Una relacin afectiva es para ser super amigos, para compartir las cosas buenas y malas de la vida, para estar juntos en la riqueza y en la pobreza, en la abundancia y en la miseria, en la juventud y en la vejez.    Llegar el momento en que al hombre ya no se le pare ni con viagra, pero si el sexo no es el centro de la relacin con tu pareja, el que ya no puedas responderle a tu pareja sexualmente ser lo de menos, y ella estar contigo porque tu le brindas otros aspectos que son mucho ms importantes que el sexo: la comunicacin, el respeto, el amor, el cuidado, la paciencia, el afecto y la asistencia, entre otras.    En esencia, en una relacin no solo debe haber sexo, tambin debe existir comunicacin, respeto, amor, tolerancia, paciencia, afecto y comprensin, entre otras tantas.|`|cfef563dc71c678482f28d174e458010aa	el sexo no arregla los problemas.... y que pasara despues cuando ya el sexo sea aburrido? la rutina tambien suele llegar al sexo.|`|GVwpWXBsaa	Mira, el sexo es importantisimo, pero no es precisamente lo mas importante en una relacion, para que esta funcione, no basta con ke haya buen sexo, si no tambien debe haber una buena y excelente comunicacion. si no fijate, porke hay relaciones que no funcionan aun teniendo sexo.... y hay relaciones que funcionan a las mil maravillas, aun durando mucho tiempo para dar el primer paso de hacerlo|`|wsCx7lrqaa	Creo que solo una parte, la otra parte es la confianza y los lazos que se puedan construir entre dos personas.|`|MAYtC23oaa	claro que el sexo no lo es todo! no te enamoras de alguien xq puedas tner sexo, primero te cae bien, despues es tu amiga, te gusta, tienen quimica, tienen temas de conversacion,se tienen confianz... todos esos peke?os detalles hacen la relacion! tu crees ke una relacion puede ser solo sexo? no, llegaria el punto en que seria muy monotono!  el sexo es para mejorar la relacion (no cuando esta a punto de terminar, si no cuanto esta en su punto mas alto) y no para dcir adios!!|`|opjvPotzaa	obvio debe existir comunicacion, comprension, confianza, actitud, animo, amor, cari?o, sentimiento y pasion por la otra persona, una persona no es solo apra conplacerte sexualmente las pareja sirven para depositar todo su apoyo y confianza, una pareja es alguien con quien puedas confiar y expresarte, el sexo conforma solo una parte de la relacion cuandoe xiste mucha confinaza, pero cuando se llega a esa parte intima no hay que descuidar la relacion afectiva que nombre, los sentimientos y todo eso...|`|nGmNR5mCaa	El SEXO es muy IMPORTANTE.

eRqlYNQaaa	He's cheated on you with two different women and you have only been together for 15months.  It sounds like it isn't going to stop.    Don't just threaten to leave him - do it.  Don't stay there and take this kind of treatment.    Print out a copy of the emails and take them with you when you go - and if he asks why you have left, then tell him you know all about the cheating and the lies he has been telling.  If you have the proof he will have no comeback.   If you say he will become angry and agressive, then make sure you are not within the firing line when this all comes out. |`|KHVEK3aRaa	So, if you'd "Love to leave him", I'm not seeing a problem here.

If he doesn't tell the truth even after you tell him, "I don't need this in my life anymore and would love to leave him". that means he's not much interested in you and has interests on another girl.     So don't wait and be more and more hurt, its time for you to move on and start a new life without him.    Good luck |`|OpehFRz5aa	You should leave him before it becomes serious!|`|IhqLqoTJaa	look the thing is is that he is cheating on you wether he tells you r not do u wan na be with a cheater so you should just get up and leave and let him figure it out he is a looser |`|cBbnhpfZaa	believe it or not there a plenty of decent guy out there... leave him asap ... he will realise wat he had once your gone... then he will learn to respect women, not lie and cheat |`|FQ2U3lpMaa	u better do something b4 he breaks ur heart|`|bh5a8QyUaa	leave
AA10716193	You are being sensitive about her, understanding her worries and assuring her that she will not loose you.  Of course these things are perfect if you talk about them, and she should give value to that attitude of you.    In the other hand, we know that "words" are just like a pill for a pain, but the anxiety is still there.    She is being anxious BY COMPARING her with others.    If she would be alone in this planet or living only with ugly girls then she would not be worry. This means that the REASON for her panic is outside of her, BUT LIVING IN HER MIND.    So, if I were in your shoes, I would begin a project, perhaps a written project, I would share it with her, involve her in the subject, and let her know that she is a great partner to define ideals with, that she is a NORMAL GIRL but that the MAIN CONTACT AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST POINTS SHE HAS is her mind, her opinions, her sensibility, her criteria, etc,     What I mean, break her idea about "exterior aspect is the best of a woman" and start making her to feel and believe that "mental spiritual sensitive aspect is the best of a woman".    Change the scenario, she cannot change the outside, but then, it is time to show, define, polish the inner part, and in that field, make her feel important for you, let her know how interesting is to share important or delicate subjects with her...    She is comparing the EXTERNAL aspect, make her feel SIGNIFICANT with her INTERNAL aspect....    Good luck|`|zl9zbhDKaa	How often do you tell her you love her? She might feel insecure because you don't tell her what she needs to hear as often as she wants to hear it. I think you should just sit down with her and talk to her and try to get her to understand how much you love her and how you will never leave her and all that good stuff.  Idk.  Good luck!
AA10716193	first of all do not be worry about this, perhaps you do not believe it, but anxiety is noticed by people    second, do not forget ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE, in this case, a family, a House, health, activity, a computer, or any other thing MATERIAL, PERSONAL OR SPIRITUAL that you know you have and MANY OTHERS DO NOT    third, use this freedom and peace you have by being alone in useful things for YOURSELF. Perhaps you think the world is not noticing you, but then you can use this time to be a better woman, to be more updated about your future career, listen more to your family, to friends.  Once you have a boyfriend, perhaps you will not have the time or the chance to study something you like, to go where you like, etc    fourth, think that you need to be an equilibrated individual person, no matter if you are with someone or not, you must HAVE BALANCE, beacuse that is what any guy will be looking for in a girl.  We do not look for problems, disorders, etc... we preefer to get close to nice people who has balance, interesting matters, and AN OWN LIFE.    fifth, enjoy this period of your life, ENJOY WHAT YOU HAVE, instead of missing what you do not. Believe me, many people who has a couple misses their freedom    sixth, focus your energy in being a better woman for yourself. Do not waste your energy in getting worry about the other peoples decition...    When they want, they will approach...    You cannot control others minds and make them notice you... that is out of your control...    All you can do in the meanwhile is BE A BETTER VERSION OF YOURSELF.  |`|AA11512890	Guys love to be admired. So maybe instead of telling him about all your great deeds, whatever; listen to him.  Ask him about his hobbies, and act really interested. Just be natural, not over eager, and you will be fine.|`|NTUr0t3haa	You don't need a boyfriend at age 16. Be patient.

PeMpDAbraa	It depends on how he said it. He could actually be concerned for you b/c that is almost 300lbs and is extremely unhealthy, no matter how tall you are. If he was rude about it then tell him to go to hell but if he sounded like he was concerned then try to understand...some people aren't very tactful, especially when dropping a bomb like that. If you exercised and ate right then you would be losing weight. Go to your dr and he/she can direct you from there. Good luck. |`|SZOONQ1zaa	Just keep up the good work, the pounds will come off soon.  I just hope you are loosing the weight for you and not because he thinks you should.|`|cG6s1MJSaa	if you are really doing everything you say you are, i can't believe that you haven't lost any weight. You should want to get down some because that is not a healthy weight. He should not have said it like that but that is not the person he married. you should want to stay similar to what your husband married.|`|pma90Xycaa	To me it would depend on how he told you that you needed to lose weight.  If he said it in a mean way about not being attracted to you, then I'd be insulted.  But if he said it because he was concerned about your health (diabetes, high blood pressure), then I would still be hurt by what he said, but understand that he was just trying to have me around forever because he loves me so much.      If you're eating better, drinking water, and exercising...I'm wondering if you're not eating enough.  If you're working out 7 times a week, are you doing cardio or strength training?  (Your best bet is to do a combination of both, but strength training just every other day, NOT every day...cardio everyday if possible.)  Your best bet is to eat about 5 small meals instead of 3 big ones.      Hang in there with him and give him the benefit of the doubt.  Don't think of him as trying to change you because he's upset with your weight, think about it as he's just trying to make you more healthy for the sake of himself and your children.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	i've been trough in your situation, my husband called me elephant. I don't care much actually because i knew to myself that i can loose weight and trim my tummy, and yes i did. Exercise, i eat whenever i got hungry (but i ate in small piece just to subside my hunger), i didn't starve myself, i avoid any sugary drinks, just plain water. I worked so hard in the house, exercise for three to four hours a day for 6 days in a week (in the house). I know it is good for me not for him. i will be look good and confident once i got my target weight, and i did and i am proud of myself, its not for him, it's for me.|`|CfEQ1qaTaa	well first off your husband needs to be more aware of how hurtful his actions were. secondly lose the weight for yourself NOT your husband. feel good about working out and eating right.      if you have tried losing weight but still are unable to go to your drs and get checked out get a full physical and ask your dr why your not losing weight. my older sister has 4 kids and couldnt lose any of the weight turns out she has pcos (polycystic ovary syndrome) when she got that under control she started losign weight not dramatically just about 1 or 2 lbs a week.    if i may suggest you READ the labels on all the food items and look at the soidum levels on a daily basis you shouldnt consume more than 1500 grams of sodium so in all those lean cuisine meals theres about 800 in one meal. withyour workout im not sure what you exercises you were doing but you should have lost some kind of weight so i suggest you go to bally fitness and get a personal trainer that is the best way to go its worth the money honey.     be sure to rink plenty of water during and after each workout . after each workout session get atleast 20 grams of protein in you right away and at each meal consume about 20 or more grams of protein as well WHY? protein helps burn fat and gain muscle so if your eating fruits and veggies the only place your getting protein from is the leafy green veggies and thats not much. good sources of protein : lean meats,fish, leafy green veggies,beans, eggs dairy products etc. do some research and maybe talk to a nutritionist.     ALSO what helped me ALOT was making a weekly menu for breakfast lunch and dinner go buy just the ingredient for the menu and then i had to eat what i made plus there was no temptation around. stay on track and keep your head up.|`|CWtSgPVYaa	it's him you did your best to lose the weight. most women do gain some weight when they have children it's not your fault. My grandmother who's 84 years old weights 320 lbs after having 16 children so it's not your fault that your bigger then what you were when you was married. just ignore him and don't pay him any mind what so ever.|`|QVn8aVleaa	I don't want to sound insensitive, but he didn't marry 300 lb you. He married 200 lb you. That's a big difference. He is entitled to his feelings about it. If you want him to be happy try Weight Watchers. My mom did it and lost a ton of weight. It really changes your life. And you'll feel better about yourself, too.|`|2s6xvyGNaa	Well he needs to get over it.   You'll never be that small again because you had kids. Everybody gains weight i bet he has to and he got the nerve to say that your big and needed to lose weight. Whats wrong with him?|`|ad2dd5f63bb3344b98840a4cccdc3e75aa	Try going to your doctor so you could star on a plan |`|mkUpzQKQaa	screw him!!! find someone who appreciates you for who you are and not what you look like!!!|`|AA10716193	Sorry by writing some lines even if I am not a lady.    I think you can visit a nutrition center or a nutriologist and LET the specialist give the last word.    People should not only think in weight, there are other factors to be considered.    He might be ONLY seeing the weight part, but what if you are in your most convenient weight according to the kind of life, age, etc you have?    It is not only a matter of opinions at the end of the whole discussion, it is a matter of health.    Why do not you let the specialist to say the last word and then the decition is not for your husbands wishes or by your activity or pasivity, but according to a specialist research and results?    Sorry again, I hope you do not get upset by my intervention, just wanted to say something about your worry. Good luck.|`|yweuC6bbaa	First of all, congrats on having your 4 children!  Secondly, please do not take offense to my answer.  I gained a lot of weight, got comfortable with it, and it wasn't untill my husband told me the same thing, that I realized it wasn't fair to him.  If he wanted to sleep with a 'fat' woman, he would have married one.  Yes, at first, my feelings were hurt, but then I thought about it, and I was happier to have him tell me that then for him to just leave me over it.  Most couples want to have honesty at the core of their relationship.  This can be a little hurtful at times, but you still want him to be honest with you right?  Your husband married you at 195lbs.  Most men do take into consideration the fact that you may be a little heavier after having children. But honestly, 100 lbs is a bit excessive.  You more than likely don't look much like you did before.  Remember, he does have to look at you naked.  This is often hard for men to accept.  Remember, love and attraction are different for men than it is for women.  It may be a little difficult for him to see you as the sexy wife he fell in love with.  You more than likely can't do all the active things you may have once done together.  Bassicaly, a 300 lb woman can't keep up with a 200 lb woman more times than not.  Also, you are setting an example for your children no matter what you think.  Do you want any of them to be at such an unhealthy weight?  Probably not, if only for the sake of their health.  That brings another point. You WILL live a shorther, unhealthier life at that weight.  He may be afraid you will gain even more weight.  There are so many reason why it is his responsibility to tell you what he did.  Just because someone tells you something that hurts your feelings, doesn't mean they don't love you, it is a sign that he does love you.  If he didn't, he wouldn't care about your weight.  You shouldn;t take his concern as a hurtful thing.  Don't you teach your children that 'sometimes the truth hurts?'|`|ofCqZIxDaa	just lose the weight for yourself not for him.

SuyLE4Zkaa	I don't think forcing him to talk, or giving him an ultimatum about breaking up will help. Try to understand his situation. He probably is over whelmed and does not want/ or knows how to discuss it w/ anyone. And it could also be that he is disinterested in the relationship, because it has been long distance for so long. Evaluating the relationship maybe helpful, but i feel that since it is at such a vulnerable time, it might not be the best decision. Just be there for him, make him realize that yeah he is going through a hard time and you recognize that and that you are there for him. Also maybe don't call him so much, showing him respect about his decision of talk talking all the time, and instead of asking him if he still loves you, tell him that you love him (if u really do that is) and wait for him to realize how much the relationship and you matter to him, or if they really do. Give him time and if he still does not reciprocate then talk to him about your relationship, and say that you are in, is he?   Hope that helps  that's all. :)|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	Sounds like it's time to let him go. He's not in love anymore, and doesn't know how to tell you, typical man. Sorry, but it's over.|`|r1ooj70naa	I think u should tell him that u feel u need to break up for a while.  This will be a kick up the back side for him and it gives him a reality kick to see if this shows him what he really wants.  if u didnt call him in 2 days and he didnt bother with u, thats very odd and he needs to sort himself out.  anxiety is not healthy, and if he wont talk to u then there is also a lack of trust going on there. |`|Uhyucn4Raa	he may just be overwhelmed about everything right now...let him know that your there for him but dont be pushy about it...if he completely shuts you out set him down face to face and find out really whats going on...but its not you im sure|`|1658755688df2638db81d183569d6357aa	Something is obviously going on, maybe instead of asking if he still loves you, ask him what is his problem?? does he not want you to call him anymore? does he want a break?? get to the point, if he is gonna break your heart, let it be sooner rather then later.

Good luck|`|AA10716193	Whatever he has, or whatever he is feeling or living, the fact is that you are worry without knowing what to do.    He is not going to tell you what to do, and it seems that he is not being open to his girlfriend to speak about what is going on with him.    it seems that you are being worry about him but he is not sharing with you his situation. He has changed. He has taken a new attitude and you are one more of all the persons that have noticed it.    So, it seems he is not needing your help or others, he is in his own individuality, alone, closed and hermetic.    Well, in front of this kind of election he has done for himself, it seems that you are not invited to participate in his world.  You share with him the title of boy and girlfriend, but the rest it does not sound like a team or couple.    It sounds as if you were interested in a relation he is not.    Then it is the time to let him show by his own a respectful interest for the relation. This is not only you having interest for him, a relation in a couple should be in both ways.    Let him feel your absence, let him notice you are not there. play the same cards.  I am not saying you should close something or finish something, I only suggest you to play with strategy, give him some of his own system, in a word, I can say... dissapear.    If you dissapear and he reacts, congratulations, he is there noticing you and showing interest, in that moment, let him know that oyu are feeling a change in interest and let him decide if he wants to share with you his life or not.    If you dissapear and he makes nothing, then, congratulations, your freedom ticket was just in front of you, and you only needed to take it in your hands.    It may be hard, but how to get clear signs of interest from a couple that is in his own world without noticing that he has a relation that he is not paying attention to?  Only this way... dissapear.    If it goes perfectly with his wishes he will appreciate your act.    If it is not what he wants, he must react. And in that case, talk to him very clear for once about all this.      |`|WP44HcJyaa	what does your heart tells you? what ever the problems know that this the time he needs you most. you need to let him know how much you love him and how you consider his problems yours.|`|tcJaFQITaa	I think it is time for you to be honest to yourself, he could be seeing someone else, he may have lost interest in the relationship.

You need to talk to him to find out. Which is obviously really difficult at the moment since he won't talk to you back.    I'd phone him and say something about being fed up of his behaviour and he's going to lose you if he carries on. Say that he has 7 days to change the way he's acting or it's over.    I hope you're ok. It's crap that he's treating you this way.|`|RnFpjFODaa	he's obviously preoccupied with something else. or someone else. i know u prolly love him and everything, but sometimes things just don't work out. u both might just need some space. |`|rLwRRYynaa	men don't often like to discuss their emotional problems, give him time and space and show that you care.  stressing over it will just make it worse for both of you.  |`|gjb83nQEaa	Well the biggest sign is that he isn't opening up and telling you what the problem is. You should take a trip and go see him. Force him to tell you what the problem is. He might have someone else in his life to talk about his problems. Either way, you deserve to know the truth. |`|pgJ9lvyMaa	It really could be all the stress he's dealing with or, sadly, it may be the end of this relationship.  Seriously talk to him, and let him know that you are worried and that you care, but that this lack of communication on his part is not only hurting you, it's killing your relationship.      Let him know that if he needs space, you are okay with that.  I'm not saying that while you guys take a break you need to wait for him though.  It's not fair to you to have to deal with this for as long as you have.  A long distance relationship is hard enough.  One with no communication is impossible.      Good Luck.

H*ELL NO!  they just kept on making fun of me everytime they could. so then learned to be strong and stood up against those pplz. but it didn't work either. because those pplz will just like it. that the fact that ur reacting to them being mean to you.  then finally i realized...what do i care????  i mean they aren't my friends, or the pplz that i care about? so y the ***** should i care about them???        so then in 7th grade i just stopped caring. what ever they say i'm just gonna ignore it and move on. or sometimes when pplz say " gosh u are so skinny" even though they didn't say it in a mean way i just shrugged and said "So? it doesn't bother me, so it shouldn't bother u either"    i use that sayying quite often. and now pplz stop making fun of me. because they know that it doesn't get to me anymore. and they are starting to except me just the way i am.       because i'm me. and that's all i'll ever be.  so if they don't like it??  well too bad!!!      hope this helps!    good luck  and just remember to only care about the pplz that truly care about u.  trust me. it makes life wayyyyy easier !  :)  |`|WT9cjXtIaa	Madison, I can tell you that he doesn't really know how bad it is. I'm a dad, if he hasn't done anything about it, he just doesn't know the extent. Calmly talk to him about it. The more adult-like you can discuss it with him, the better he'll understand. He saw it when he went to school (and yes, it was just as bad back then). I'm sure he'll try his best to help you out. Switching school will probably not be an option though. There is no substitute for a good education. |`|rvVsbVBJaa	it doesn't matter what other people think of you!  you are being YOU and that is all that matters!  Keep your head held high girl!|`|AA11118663	You'll face stuff like that everywhere you go. You have to learn to deal with it|`|5xm6pS2Saa	I hate people like that. Just ignore them. Think of it like this: As long as you like yourself, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Those people will come and go, but it's you who actually matters in your life. It's hard, but just ignore those mean jerks. I know how you feel. |`|7sf3zt1Oaa	So, do you really like your haircut? then why care for the rest of the school talking about it? Only beautiful and popular people are being talked about. You see you have to stand up for what you believe in and for who you are. I know that the pain is real but you can't let yourself drown because someone else is pulling you. I don't think that your dad doesn't care at all, in fact he intends the best for you by giving you the best education through that school...hope this could help!

It sounds more like lust than love, you wanting what you cant have and nothing to risk your relationship over. If you don't have feelings for your girlfriend any more then be a man and tell her. If you do love her then be man enough to work at it. Lies will just lead you down a slippery slope and you could end up with neither girl.

Ask him out. if he says no, your a girl-- you could deffinetly get another man.|`|AA10716193	life is made of actions.    If you do not act, somebody else will.    I would say that you can take the risk, do not expose yourself totally, but propose something nice directly, a kind of "I need to buy a book but I do not want to go alone to the bookstore", something like that.    In that case you can be alone with him for more than minutes, OUTSIDE the normal scenario, and if he is shy he will have more chances to express himself.    Take the risk. He might take his as well.    In the worst of cases, if does not react, you do not loose anything, on the contrary, you will know he might feel something BUT NOT ENOUGH to express himself in order to get you.    
af2145487047aa2ee8cf7d14b8391f9aaa	I don't think it's tacky, but I prefer when people keep the wedding day info on the invite and email me the website. If you're really worried about it being tacky, don't do it. Get people's email addresses and email them a week or so after you send out the invites. |`|mAqohMxyaa	Nope, not at all.  Most people do that. :)    Check this page out  http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/etique...  and  http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-plann...    It would be best to not put it on the actual invitation.  Just make some cards or something and include it.|`|HMvXkR6Faa	I'm putting it on mine.  It doesn't automatically imply you want people to see your registry information (including registry information with your invite is considered tacky).  And an extra inclusion card can be expensive just for one line listing the website (I know for the invites I want for my wedding it's an extra $2 just for an inclusion card).  You could put it on the response card, but then people will mail that back to you and not have it written down.    I'm putting the website on mine because 50% of our guests are from out of province and everyone else (save maybe 10 people) will be driving almost an hour to get to our wedding.  We intend to have directions and maps from the multiple locations people will be coming from, as well as hotel information for the hotel we will be reserving rooms at, along with other hotels in town.    And in my opinion, automatically assuming that including a wedding website implies asking for gifts from a registry is tacky.  Why do people always think the worst (manners) of others.|`|abBCyJhFaa	nah i dont think so :)|`|AA11380378	SEPARATE CARD PLEASE!!!!!!    Platinum bride is right. Some people that respond here do not have a clue about wedding etiquette.    Registry information, attire information, no children information etc. should not go on the invitation it's self. Save the date cards are the place for your wedding website and other information. Invitation inserts provide additional information, but PLEASE, not in the invite itself.    Good luck|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	People are overly judgmental. A wedding website mention is not the same as mentioning the registry. Most websites include pictures, places to stay, other wedding events etc. This is information that is pertinent and useful. I think it is perfectly appropriate to mention it.|`|d802e4569c99ca9c59f3b076b0963fedaa	Done all the time. I got these custom made inserts with the wedding web site including the blog of the planning! |`|MannYZf7aa	Not tacky at all.I'd do it.People are going to say it's tacky,but if you feel like you really want to do it,than go for it.|`|AhKaLuO3aa	Despite the feedback you will get from most women on here, do not include info regarding your website or a registry (usually one and the same). It  is just downright tacky. You might as well include a note in the invitation that reads "Buy us a gift. It's your entrance fee into our wedding and reception."|`|84d2ee0139a6557092dfc2736e3eadb8aa	I e-mailed our wedding website link to my mom, and she forwarded it to all her friends when she was asked about it for engagement gifts.    Also, we're in the process of sending out our save-the-dates, and we're including a card with our website address because our website has all the hotel info in detail. If you have maps and hotel info on a card that's included with the invitation, then that's where it would be appropriate. But NOT on the actual invitation.|`|PxdzF9Bzaa	I think including it on the invitation is tacky. I feel like it would spoil your beautiful, formal invitations. If it's being included solely for guests to find out directions, the reception venue usually supplies cards for that.    Spread the word of the website some other way. How about having a family member or MOH email people with the website?     They could write something like, "John and Jane have created a website about their upcoming wedding. Visit for the most up to date information about the wedding plans."      |`|M9ApBTYvaa	Put the website address on the rsvp card. That's what we did.|`|evW18jvIaa	Forget about what's considered tacky or not and do what makes sense for you and your guests.    Where I come from, sending registry information with invites is perfectly acceptable, and so are money dances at the wedding...both things which are pretty widely scorned on this website.    Of course try to be courteous and not intentionally rude in the choices you make, but don't make everything all about etiquette and the rules or you'll grow to hate wedding planning. |`|Wzws8v8daa	i recently got an invitation for one of my friends and she printed it right on the invitation, at the bottom. i think that's a good idea rather than wasting more paper for seperate cards|`|f40234a0db309acc6bf0f88f955199e5aa	Tacky, tacky, tacky.  Amazing what people do today.    People should find out about your wedding website by word of mouth.    This is almost as bad as putting a deposit slip for your bank in the invite.    |`|OTlBdxYWaa	If you haven't already sent out the Save the Date cards you can add it to those otherwise I don't think a separate card is tacky. |`|k7b2CluKaa	I say go for it. I think I will include a little sheet that says something like, "For more information go to ...". It's your wedding, you can do what you want to do.|`|0303375c5cfc6c1e237c9f4d0cdd2722aa	That's what I did.      Our wedding RSVP was on a website though, so at the bottom of the invite, I put "please RSVP at (website) or (phone number)".     I think it's wasteful to put a whole new card for it, if you have an RSVP card, add it on to that.|`|yLQxRkoXaa	no I don't think it's tacky at all. Check out the pocket invitations, they have slots dedicated to insert extra things like that. It would be a waste of money to send out and additional card with just a web address.  I purchased the pocket style invites and and connected to the envelope were the extra slots I included direction to the church and reception site, and also a card with a list of local and convenient hotels. But most of my guest are from out of town.|`|ivFu7k81aa	I would not put it on the actual invitation. You can include it on a direction card or hotel accommodation card that is inserted with the invite, but not on the actual invite.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	If you have to ask then it usually is tacky.    No, do not put it on the invitation itself.  A separate card would be fine, perhaps along with the page that lists the directions to the ceremony & reception.  |`|o7lAXurcaa	HELLO PEOPLE READ THE QUESTION. she is asking about putting her wedding website...not a registry!!!

First, you should calm down.    Then, you should consider the facts. Friend embarrasses you about your period. What I'm curious about knowing is... Why are you so keen on telling everyone on Yahoo Answers that you got your period, but not your crush? I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing that he knows that. Most guys get really creeped out about PMS, but you have NO reason to be embarrassed. It's a natural part of life.|`|hEKMYqZUaa	Shake it off. Later in life you'll be laughing about it.

You can have butt-sex with him if you wanted. if he's in to that kind of thing.|`|TtgJsETtaa	Absolutely not!    I think it's a great thing to do and it's very fun. I think that it's an excellent way to strengthen a relationship.     : )|`|iqpiEd8Naa	No, as long as it's with your husband -- totally not a sin... I know this for sure because I watched some Christian show and the lady was asking if masterbation was wrong if you were thinking about your spouse and they said no....so definitely - more power to you!!  I think that's a great way to keep things alive in your relationship!!|`|7Vhlszr1aa	are you kidding me! what if you actually have sex.

wzpCMI44aa	Yeh, don't get involved. It's just gonna get dramatic and ugly if you do. Wait until you know for sure that she's done with him. At this point, she obviously isn't.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I would steer clear of her if I were you. Its obvious she still likes him so why bother putting your feelings on the line?|`|AA12346188	Stop presuming things.  It is her personal liking.  It is none of your business.  If you are interested in her, just go ahead and have her.|`|7HTO2CDYaa	join in|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You are asking things that no one can possibly know except them. You also are really trying to interfere with her relationship. You've got to give her the opportunity to end it or fix it.

Obviously they love each other and have a deep committement so dont be the one to take that away from them for just a stupid crush. Do the right thing even if its not for yourself.|`|B3TrMkIyaa	 If that girl is still sleeping with her ex, then that means that that girl still have feelings for her ex. |`|YLFgkVZUaa	Ah,just be done with her.  That drama that you don't need.  |`|ZbPAg41maa	She was with him for a while so I would wait that one out. Sounds like they still are ino each other and if she doesn't know you like her yet why not tell her. If she is over her ex she will get with you. Good Luck?|`|NGfiUo12aa	If you like her, then now IS the time to find out if there is potential.  Show her how you would treat her, and give her clear signs that you want her.  Women like initiative, and you may be what she really wants.. you'll never know until you try.    |`|Lmk8X8ECaa	It's none of your business if they are sleeping together. If you get involved this could result into a fight between you and the ex boyfriend. Move on. Yes she could still have feelings for him or they could just be having sex. If she dated him four years then yes theres a strong chance they will be getting back together. I would move on because she doesn't sound like she is totally over him and do you really want a girl in your life who keeps running back to her ex or cheating on you with him behind your back?  I am assuming no. Theres better people in life. |`|h2WkfMzgaa	She doesnt know you like her. Hello???? What are you waiting for. If they broke up and this time she is no longer interested in him you may become her rebound. it may be that she will transfer her feelings for him, to you.     Eventually you will both figure out if its genuine or not, either is possible.     Is she sleeping with her ex?; There is a very high possibility of that. if she is it could be for many reasons.   - She may be very vulnerable and doesnt want to rush into anything (maybe sex) with some1 new.  - She doesnt want him to start messing with someone new.  - They have bomb *** sex.  - They still have feelings for each other but know that it will take time to work past their differences.  - They know that they wont ever get back together might as well be friends w benefits- since they are already comfortable with each other.  -they are working on getting back together SLOWLY    But if she is completely done with him; if he did her dirty there is less of a chance.    Offer her your friendship without saying u r friends. ask her out on dates; how her day was and if she had fun with you on ur date. then when it feels right tell her you are interested in dating her bc u know she just came out of a serious relay and you think she's the perfect girl for you. lol 
06e10f59627f39ed5b3c444355de1a97aa	The worst I ever had was a guy friend I knew.  The night he passed his bar exam, we went to parties together, and at the end of the night when he brought me home...we became more than just friends.    He was terrible.  It was as if he didn't know what he should do.  I couldn't  believe it.  He really was the worst. How could someone who was so smart in law...be so dumb in bed?  I was really turned off.    He kept asking to see me again.  He thought the sex was hot.  So strange to me that he didn't realize how bad it was.  I never hurt his feelings, but just told him I didn't want to date...to just remember it as a night when we became a little more than just friends.    He remembers it as hot.  I remember it as the worst I ever had!  |`|Hrgp1oC5aa	   My ex fiance.......thankfully I dodged a bullet and got out quick!|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	My mom when I was 7 and scared of the dark and wouldn't sleep alone.    haha jk I love my mom|`|lZVtLvkGaa	I got balled by this guy whos wanker was bent 90 degrees, felt weird and he lasted about 20 seconds|`|MU0gh8IFaa	only prostitutes can answer this qs  unless u r promoting promiscuity|`|AA10478165	The worst I ever had was wonderful!|`|Fuej6dMPaa	my ex. he only wanted to do it like twice a month and the longest he could last was 2 minutes, i actually timed it lol. and that is one of the reasons why he is now an ex.|`|nJvnsXplaa	Nope sorry..I guess I was lucky enough not to end up with guys like that;)|`|1isNCpfiaa	The worst was this guy who I was friends with for years, but never did it with him. We finally did it and...oh my god. It was not as good as I thought. I mean, he was very attractive/sexy, but when it comes to the bedroom, it wasnt good. Nice size but was a little "all over the place". In his defense we were both nervous, so...We're still friends, but...the sex can wait for a while.     :/|`|2jwimxP7aa	Do I have to say their name? It was a girl, she always thought when I got back to my old place she could sleep with me so one day I said my secret girlfriend is pregnant...she soon backed off, I am probably the only guy she had slept with and sadly she will get no more, sorry for my rudeness but it is true|`|xUiKU2v4aa	It was lockjaw.  She couldn't get anything right.  She wouldn't do anything.  She was just there and made some sounds.  she didn't move much unless I hit it too hard.  I view sex as a team effort.

So I had no complaints.|`|0AFGnsPYaa	Hmm, Had to be this butt ugly lad called Elliot Maunder, he was jsut sooo small in that department tbh. soo baad!!! Thank god its over!

Oh snappp and HELLLLOOOOO I had this one guy talk so much smak about his department and when i unzipped his pants to put on the condom it wasnt hard and it was tiny like a mini sharpie the thickness and the length. it was so disgusting.

NUehpH4yaa	you guys are both guys? no offense leaving someone over a job is kind of shameless. but anyway, if you guys just fight all day, tell him there is no point to continue this relationship it's suppose to make me happy, not stressed, and i want to explore new options. |`|qNMfaJ4Raa	If you still love him and want to be with him but are blinded by the fact that he has no ambition and career plans - don't give up on him just yet. Work on him. Encourage him to go back to school, even a trade school. Before actually breaking up, give him an ultimatum. Tell him that if he really does love you, that he has to get his act together or else you'll leave him. Seven years is a long time, are you sure you just want to throw it out the window and wipe your hands clean of it?|`|prtKFgxWaa	looks like you kind of ended ur LOVE relationship 3 years ago|`|V3UsTvUsaa	Just tell him plain out and simple.

Also, honesty is the best policy.  Here are some tips:  1. Think about why you are breaking up.  2. Plan out how long you are willing to spend breaking up.  3. Break up in person.  4. Break up calmly.  5. Expect any or all of the following reactions:  -Questioning  -Crying  -Arguing  -Bargaining or Begging  -Lashing Out  6. Distance yourself.  7. Breaking Up is Just a Normal Part of Life.  I hope you solve it wisely.|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	    It'll only get worse. At least til he brings himself up to your level.He is 'abitionally lazy' and needs to wake up.He has little or no grasp of lifes challenges and if you hang in with him and don't shock him into doing something to improve himself,believe me,you'll be nurse-maiding him thru life and enabling him to stay the way he is.Level with him and give him a time line to establish goals that are up to his capabilities.Set a time line and stick to it.If you don't want to do that or you don't think he'll make it...don't waste your time.   He'll be hurt if you break up,but,he ,your love,and your life will be a wasted,ruined mess if you don't do it.He may even go on to be abetter person.What the heck,he can't get much worse!!!         If you are not saying what else...I think you just need to know that you need to do the right thing...and you know what that is.|`|hRpoMZyjaa	well i had a very similar situation with my first boyfriend too... i was your age when i broke up with him and we were living together and i just told him i was moving back home and that we could still be together but secretly i wanted OUT! i finally told him weeks later that i couldnt do it anymore and got really depressed called me all hours of the day and night telling me he couldnt eat, sleep, work etc. but i stayed strong because i know i wanted to move on from him. looking back i should have just told him the "nice" truth and not waste anymore of your youth on something you know deep down is not going anywhere. you are in you prime and dont rob yourself of it. have a face to face and tell him just because we are not together and we have grown apart does not mean our friendship will end we just have chosen different paths in life and i have excepted yours now except mine...GOOD LUCK AND LIVE LIFE!!!!!|`|ElZsAyVraa	don't sugar coat it, just say hun its over between you and I.        the first and hardest step you will make is to move out right away.  its over remember, don't play into the sadness, head onward and upward with your goals.  be strong.    its no longer your problem.

f6WXqS17aa	This seems to be an apples versus oranges question.  Having high standards has nothing to do with ones depth of intelligence or character.   I think it would be safe to say that someone who has high standards also must have some form of depth, indicating that if one has high standards one is not shallow.  If the standards seem packaged, typical, or straight forward; main stream and predictable, then they could be interpreted as shallow just on behalf of people's familiarity with those standards.  Such standards are easily known and understood and non-unique.  In such case, I would expect it would be easy for someone to misinterpret such standards as being shallow.  On the other hand people often interpret non-standard, eccentric behavior as deep.  In either case, I think it is shallow if your standards or modes of communication and behavior are without reason or understanding, no matter how eccentric or "normal" they are.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	It's the same thing. If your standards are too high, you're shallow. It means you think you're above others, and that they're not good enough for you. You're shallow.|`|AA10234026	Those are two differrent genres.     Shallow is lacking in depth, not hard to conceptualize. e.g. lacking in knowledge. Playing games on the computer or watching comics will not give you depth. Social interaction with people and courses in the humanities e.g.sociology will give you depth.    "High standards" depends on behavior that gives you respectability among your peers. Different peer groups have different definitions of what is considered respectable. |`|NUehpH4yaa	high standards you would still consider it, even if they didnt have "IT"  shallow = never|`|AA10614910	Having high standards has nothing to do  with dating someone because they have a hot face/body. Not sure how you see a similarity...|`|71wBNgbnaa	Being shallow, I believe, is only dating someone because they're hot, or being very exclusive because you will only date the best-looking person, the richest person, the person who lives in the best house, drives the best car, and has the best job in town.    Having high standards, however, is different. Many people who hold high standards for potential partners hold those standards to the person's personality, morals, and values more so than the person's looks.     For example, looks don't really matter to me. I look for someone who can make me laugh a lot, but also knows when it's time to be serious, loves me for me and realizes that while I may not be the thinnest or prettiest girl in the room, I can hold an intelligent conversation about current events and the news. I look for someone who will respect me and not treat me like a toy, a plaything, and above all, I look for someone who will never purposefully make me feel stupid or try to make me look stupid in front of other people. For the record, many of these standards that I hold, I don't just hold for a potential partner. I hold them for potential friends too.|`|KslfBKo4aa	Shallow person thinks like this:    Having money makes you a good person.    People that are good looking are good.    People that are fat and ugly are lazy.    Poor people are lazy and dumb.    Someone who has high standards thinks like this:    I like to look good all the time because I think making a first impression is important.    I set high goals for myself and I want to spend time with others who think the same way.    |`|8fqgQPjyaa	Shallow is only caring about money, looks, and anything else that's not really who the person is as a human.    High standards is caring about money, looks, etc., but not being able to appreciate a person for who they are.|`|Du7Eougnaa	High standards, you know what you're after, you set to find the highest.    Shallow is if you fidn some really hot girl, and go out with her because she's hot, or if you're with someone, and they..cut theyre hair really hsort or something and you don't like it, you dump them, or make fun of peopel who don't look completely hot.    That's being shallow.    Nothing wrong with high standards, being shallow is bad.    See people past their looks, or you won't really find someone for you.|`|KbbXZW9Faa	High standards is like they have to meet alot of expectations to be at your level. Shallow I usually think of it as you not liking them just because they are fat or something.|`|hYZhZHzmaa	i used to have a shallow ex best friend this means he/she will get with some one and after a week they find some tiny inperfections in them. then they dump them. or he/she is too tall too short ect. and having high standards means just like going after a guy who has black hair blue eyes and is a great singer. so they will not look in anybody but those who are in their standards. so thats what i think unless im wrong XD|`|ytdhoE24aa	nothing.    i like certain girls and i have no problem with that. i think everyone has their own idea of what their looking for.|`|cHCH6ORGaa	Theres not much of a difference if u have high standards u pretty much are saying u only enjoy the finer things witch makes u a shallow person |`|SLg5qebQaa	i think shallow is more to do with judgin on looks no matter how the person is on the inside, on based on something small.. like he/works in a low paid job or something like that. having high standards is wanting the best in terms of a personality and how they treat you or how they make you feel.    thats my interpretation anyway. its still a very fine line|`|74dfe88a8f1e71d7a25d52b249b4cf5eaa	    The difference is how much you have put into what you want and how much the other person is willing to put into what they want.I know a college professor that is married to a plumber.Both are excellent at what they do and are very successful.       Your standards are what you believe is right/correct.You must believe in yourself and profoundly evaluate what you believe.Do not fall for trick answers or clever phrases to answer you questions,prove them out and see the results of what has gone before you with other people that acted in the way that you question.        At the end of the day,you will have to answer to yourself,and there is no escape if you're wrong.|`|DHUcc7Jaaa	Having a standard is needed... and having a high standard is like reaching a goal... he orr she must have this this this this and this to the letter is having high standards..

To tell you the truth, I wouldn't date her. It'll ruin a good friendship. You'll probably always be freinds with her but it'll never be the same.     I wouldn't ever date my best freind because I know that life is good right now. He's amazing and we're so close. As soon as you start up something it could go wrong. I would be afraid to lose one of the most important people in my life. |`|Eqsa61Zdaa	No way! It's perfectly normal. Its even a plusplus to your relationship cause you all already know & care for each other so much. Your trust level is probably very high now, so you don't have to build up a level of trust unlike most relationships.  After you've spent a lot of time with someone, you start to see the true gems in them. If you think she's the perfect one for you (she sounds like one) just go for it.    Actually you could wait till you can tell whether she likes you or not, because usually if you burst out that you have feelings for her & she doesn't feel the same way, it'll just topple the whole relationship btwn you and her.  But i agree that sometimes its hard to tell because since shes your bestf and all, she'll probably be very close to you so you wouldn't know if she shares the same feelings as you do.    Why not seek help from your pals?  You could get them to ask her who she's into currently. If its you, then you know it's time to ask her out, and that nothing can go wrong.  Hope all goes well for you! (:    Good luck!|`|Ftn4HUeuaa	yes and no if she doesn't like you kk|`|gn0SdVLCaa	hell yea its alright..|`|NUfxeSG7aa	It's great!!

Infact - some of the best relationships come out of friendships, especially through school, or if you hangout all the time and get along!  That's great!

LIke flirting.|`|8AJXLVKqaa	It's natural.. and I'd say 9/10 boy/girl friendships turn out with one liking the other and the other not realizing it.|`|CJZZavCwaa	if your afraid youre gonna start going out, and then break up and the friendship you once had will be screwed up, then dont do it  but take a chance.  i did. i fell in love with my best friend in the world. we've been together the past 4 years. its better to fall for somebody that you've known for a while. you know a lot more about eachother by then|`|AA10098859	if she is single she most likely likes you to. the easiest way to not make it awkward is to ask one of her friends that's a girl if she likes you. or tell one of ur friends thats a guy to tell her that u like her|`|NOyrIbKVaa	well tell her and she how she feels and if she doesnt then it is ok just ask to forget about it and you know that there is more girls out there. and if she does then that is so great!!!!!!! : )|`|EzTgjJodaa	you might wanna think wise about this  cus remember  a relationship can ruin a friendship  and you guys sound like your really good friends  you dont wanna lose someone thats a good fiend like that  sometimes she wotn have someone to talk to or have ashoulder to cry on  but follow what your heart wants (=|`|Qtx8YT8vaa	 if u r really close u can ask her if she likes someone then say u like someone and describe her without saying her name see what she does|`|kk0yKVEUaa	well i'm assuming since you're best friends you can tell each other anything.. so i think you should talk to her about it. if she thinks it will ruin you're friendship, then maybe wait on it awhile or something. but if she's fine with it, then you're in! either way i think you'd be doing the right thing by not hiding your feelings..|`|wwr0MSYSaa	This girl is right for you. You and she have a genuine love for each other. It is okay. You wont know unless you ask her. Don't feel that by asking her that it will spoil your friendship. She loves you and she will understand.|`|1hqdbvlGaa	Yes its ok and yes its natural. I have had the same thing happen to me. Finding out is the hard part. My suggestion is just throw little hints out there. Subtle clues and such and see how she reacts. That or just ask her up front. Make sure you tell her that you value the friendship more than anything and the last thing you want to do is mess it up.  You have to do it yourself because getting a friend to ask just makes the situation weird.    That's my two cents|`|VcPzGUAhaa	dude, we are in EXACTLY the same boat...  haha.  i mean it, our situations are mirrored (except my girl is already going out with someone, and they're thinking about breaking up)    to answer your question though, it's fine to feel like that.  Part of the reason i haven't dated more is because i'm ALWAYS in this situation, and i don't want to ask her out!  More often than not though, it always ends up coming out SOMEHOW, and both of my friendships have been shot in the past because of the way things were.  No matter how much you do or don't want it to happen, first off, things will change.  Your relationship with her will change either for the better or worse, and i think you (and i both) should go ahead and ask her out.  I mean, if it'll be "awkward" either way, you might as well take the risk that COULD end up with the best results...   If you want to talk about it more and pick my brain some (that is, IF this is the first time this has happened for you and you actually think some of what i have to say would be of some value) then send me a message on myspace.  www.myspace.com/theonandonlytanner  -Tanner    hope it all works out.|`|xggsp61faa	aww!  that's happend to me but im a (girl) so we talked and when i got a bf he acted all weird so i realized he liked me blablabla we went out now were done and we dont talk to nomore  dont make things akward! if you really like her then stay friends cause things may happen and effect your friendship

G02cCLXJaa	In my opinion, he may be having the same feelings. It is hard to be really close to someone without caring deeply about them. I would personally suggest that you sit down and discuss it with him.    He should know how you feel. It is also valid for both of you to discuss how to handle your friendship if a deeper relationship doesn't work.    If you have the good friendship you indicate you should be able to discuss this without any problems.    Caution: In discussing it, if he seems to be uncomfortable, it may mean that he doesn't feel the same way as you do. You might back off then and give him some time to think about it.    If you make it clear from the beginning that the friendship is to important to lose, I would hope that he would also cherish and protect it.    Pastor John|`|ugMWfhZEaa	whatever yu want if you tell him how u feel then things can get messed up but if you think he feels the same then u should take that risk... if you dont say anythhing you mightl be sorry if you do you might be sorry do watever you can handle... you know...did u ever wonder wat hurts the most saying something and wishing you didnt or not saying something and wishing you did?? i think you should find out how he feels first and move somewhere from there... it would be bad if you dont say anything and ya'll couldve had a long happy relationship rather than saying something and having it awkward between you guys for a couple days...|`|uWusqb4zaa	just go for it, as long as neither of you cheat, or ditch one another for another girl/boy. you should be fine when you break up, if you break up. its okay to date your friends, hope this helped|`|y3G8y4obaa	Just think for a second. Is it a fleeting crush or do you really love him? If it's a fleeting crush, just don't do anything because all it will do is make things awkward between you. If you really love him, ease him into things slowly. Valentine's Day is a great oppurtunity. That's how I found that my now ex liked me. He sent me a pink carnation. (At my school that means a secret admirer) He was my friend and we got together. Eventually, I decided to end it because I felt like he was just a friend. We are still very close. So don't sweat it!|`|YItJjGNCaa	there are two choices id suggest. dont go for him, ive went for my guy friend, and it almost destroyed our friendship, but thankfully we worked it out... would you want ur friendship to wreck? while you could fall for some other guy, and your guy friend is one of best person you could go for advice. (men's brains!)  OR    give him casual hints, like "what if we were..." and see how he answers. if he seemed interested, keep at flirting but dont overdo it. he gives hints back? ask him, "do you like me? im just asking, nothing serious" if you aren't serious about him. if he says no... then stay friends!    good luck w tht :)|`|g6wXhUKzaa	hey im 14 you know what this had happened to me just that the guy was the one to like me,he was like my best guy friend and i had a bf he was scared to let me know,his friend told me what was going on and at first i was mad because i thought that he should had told me before what he felt toward me,but it was sad cuz i didn't like him back ,don't be scare to tell him .soooo go for it ! me and that guy are still best buddies..hope this helps   goooooood luck!!|`|bFtrJZanaa	Well im 14, and this has happened to me. Let him know you like him, and flirt a little, and he'll flirt back if he likes you. Dont let things be awkward. I'm in love with my best guy friend, and he liekes me, but we dont let that keep our friendship. Hope it helped. Good luck|`|6775e93abb954613ecfe707ce2089454aa	Im notice that your condition are same as my friend..  Im think that you better don't tell 1st...   but you can ask from his friend but sure not straight ask...  and observe his motion and feeling to you...  for example: what is his feeling or action when you are injured..  good luck!|`|Gu9xhCmIaa	be soooo carefull. make sure he isnt a horndog. if he is he will be down for ANYTHING and thats the quickest way btom ruin a friend ship. just take it slow, and send signals. but make sure you know EXACTLY what you want you dont want to be hurt or get hurt. and liking your friends is suuuuchhhhh a difficult senario.  goodluck!!!!
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Go ahead and get it done now. Wear a condom when you do have sex and I don't see any problem to affect the healing unless there is stitches and the erection could tear the stitches.|`|YWdNTZU3aa	get circumcised now|`|AA11113523	get circumcised now!!!  serious.  rite now.  :)|`|EwmHsEoiaa	I'll tell you why you shouldn't get circumcised.    Circumcision dramatically alters the penis.    The penis is supposed to be a double -layered structure.  The foreskin contains thousands of nerves on it's underside.  these are stimulated as the skin is moved up and down.  You can see a demonstration here:    http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...    It gets worse.  Because the foreskin no longer protects the glans (head of the penis) underneath, it dries out.  The glans also rubs on clothes which makes the skin harden and toughen.  Both these things reduce sensitivity further. You can see a picture here of the damamge circumcision does to the penis:    http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm    Because there is no gliding action of the skin , this obviously affects sex.  Sex will be more painful for the woman.  The foreskin allows easier entry.  It also traps and keeps moisture inside.  Often with circumcised guys the vagina gets dry.  Another thing is that because sensation is reduced, the man thrusts harder and is less in tune with the woman's feelings.  This site gives a more detailed explanation with diagrams and videos (click on the 10 reasons):    http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...      I also haven't mention the number of men that have botched circumcisions, here are some pictures:    http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Bo...    and a full list of complications that can occur:    http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...    If you have phimosis (tight foreskin), then that can be cured to.  It is usually caused by damaging masturbation habits. The way it is cured is to not masturbate as much and when you do, don't put any pressure on the penis, just move the skin up and down.  Here is a paper to read:    http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/ph...
w5uT3rluaa	You should pay more attention to her.She is probably feeling ignored and neglected by you and maybe even thinking you like your Xbox more than her so talk to her and really listen to what she is saying and try to understand where she is coming from.    (By the way apologizing can help so don't forget to do that.)|`|DY8YYluqaa	Your own fault then.    No I won't help you.|`|lzp70MlZaa	DUDE! you should have been listening to her. Don't you like her enough to keep her around. Or do you like video games better than her. tell her your sorry and pay more attention to her than the video games.

If you do care about her feelings then you should act like it more. Listen to her and actually care about what she has to say. Basically, give her attention...|`|46g3COkiaa	Call her and apologize for allowing something to get in the way of communication with her. It is pretty rude to talk to someone only to find out they weren't even paying attention. Take responsibility, apologize, and listen to her when she says you play your xbox too much. Your xbox will be around for much longer than she might if you don't prioritize. Good luck. :)|`|AA10223986	Tell her you are sorry and let her know that she means more to you then your xbox, by giving your xbox to her.  Maybe, one day she'll give it back.  If you can't part with the xbox you obviously love it more then her and you should break up.|`|hnmT5busaa	venusianarts.com    "The Game: Penetrating Into the Secret Society of Pickup Artists" by Neil Strauss (Book)    Also, carlosxuma.com, charismaarts.com    These dating tutors and their teachings (as well as other self-improvement teachings) have TRANSFORMED my life for ever.

(believe me, u dont want this).|`|NsFDmFMtaa	you really need to listen to her    sometimes all girls want to do is talk about things, they dont really need a solution.    go up to her and tell her how special she is to you and then ask her to sit down and tell you whats going on?    good luck and i hope youve learnt your lesson|`|NMWUYDhuaa	you should stop playing your xbox and tell her u love her buy her stuff and say your realy very sorry hope i could help|`|8YCUpWVKaa	apologize...  tell her how yu feel nd open up to her  yu should try listening to her nxt time too.|`|i2QSAa5Raa	obviously you really care for your girlfriend so why dont you tell her that? maybe try and spend more time with her than on your Xbox. So instead of playing a game with your buds on live go see a movie with her just to show you care. also say sorry because girls dont like to be ignored or have you forget something important (anniversary maybe? idk) girls are pretty sensitive so try to always listen to her feelings and make her feel good! hope that helps!! good luck!!|`|CR3deqLBaa	maby you should stay off your xbox  for a few days . And spend your time with her instead . I know us girls can bore you guys with our troubles sometimes. but as long as you listen and reply after i guess thats all we want.

You may save someone else the agony that you have endured. You may not like what I am saying it but I am giving you this advice straight from the hip with no emotion.

You should never be in a relationship with someone who abuses you, no matter how much you think you may love him, or whatever excuse you conjure up to console yourself of his actions. No one who loves you would ever hit you.    Remember what a marriage is about. It's the bonding of two lives in holy matrimony. He will promise to cherish you, to make you happy and to treat you well. Even before your wedding, he's already hurting you! Don't go through with it. You've got to let it go, no matter how much it will hurt.     Getting married to an abusive husband will hurt ten times worst, believe me.|`|7823c88a25415e1b637f82bb9e175c56aa	You need to get out of this relationship NOW!!!  If he's hitting you now, imagine what he will do when you're married, and he thinks he owns you.  If he doesn't care that you're crying and hurting...then he doesn't love you and doesn't deserve your love.  Please end this and move on with your life.  You will regret it if you marry this man|`|qJkCKZvWaa	u feel???when men luv sum1 dey also luv takin care of dem (experience talk) if u marry him , it will be like u approve of this violence, get out of dis before it causes u some unrepairable damage|`|e53821a233b96cd030622bf2110b8306aa	You girl are in a situation which is described as the "Amsterdam Syndrom"...You do not like the beatings, but tolerate them becasue of the affection which follows...and then the cycle begins again...beating=affection...beating = affection.  The only way to break this cycle, which will grow progressivly worse.  Just as an addict needs more of a fix, is to dissolve yourself of it.  Get as far away as possible and stay away.

Before starting for new life ( marriage) just check the foundation of the relationship. A good balanced life requires reality check. Youth is not for ever so when ur Bf will feel bored of ur body he will definitely go after some other woman so decide by yourself whether u want to have a stronger relationship with a Beast. Life is forward looking so decide it yourself.|`|AA12048821	you love him...and want the man you loved back...go away for a while write a note telling him why...stay away for a while ...when you come back if he's changed for the better and still waiting...congrats..if he's still the same...then its best you leave at once.|`|H2IzJuwDaa	U should Break up with.

Seriously, dont stay with him, it might be hitting now, but if you stay it could turn into something more dangerous.
iRFR5JTDaa	Stop making it so complicated. Change your number. It's THAT simple.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Just change your number or get caller id and dont answer it when you know its him.|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Tell your husband that you are unable to take his calls.

Take care and good luck.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Basically, he's harrassing you.    If you want it to stop firstly you neeed to tell him, then if he continues, you will need to take it to the police, and have a restraining order put on him. Usually the police give them a 'call' first to tell them to stop, normally this works..........    Changing your number is a good idea......but he would know where you live so theres really not much point.|`|p995vWpIaa	1. Look at the caller ID and don't answer.  2. Change your phone number and don't give it to him.|`|xqRq4tYCaa	Do you have children? If not put a restraining order on him and then tell him kindly.
IDrA6gMxaa	Well, it is a difficult question to answer as I always believe there is a way to fix everything in marriage.    But when it is over? when one (or both) side do not care anymore, do not want to save the marriage. Fight become everyday thing, people do not care about one another and do not want to change. It might indicate that the marriage is close to an end.|`|1nk8WPrtaa	At this point, I am convinced that my 1 year old would have better luck at this than you!!
RhXzMkcLaa	I worked in family law and I know that your children must be provided a bed to sleep in and a safe place to stay.  If you feel that this is an unstable environment I would notify your attorney and your ex that you are not comfortable with visitation until she provides a safe place for the kids.  Go with your gut as the worst thing to happen would be the first time you deny visitation you will be warned.|`|SsfnitjXaa	You are the step mom and this doesn't have anything to do with "I don't feel safe letting them bounce....."  This is all about feeling superior and happy she has a rough life.  Let them go with her and just ask them to let you know where they are.  I assume they are over the age of 6.      Why don't you ask what you can do to help her... like letting her store their stuff in your basement?|`|w88Sijh1aa	I know it is tough but you should try to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Imagine if you fell on hard times and were evicted. You may not want to have your daughter that weekend when you may sleep in a park or something. Well, knowing this, you would probably rent a room for the weekend or something so you two can see each other.  Maybe mom will do this to ensure a safe and comfortable visit.  Maybe not.  I am just trying to put your mind at ease because there was a similar situation with my daughters mom and I felt the same way.  I do know this, if you refuse her visit she can go to the courts and let them handle it. As long as, during her visit, your child is safe, then not a lot you can do.  Please remember, your sons love you and their mom and want to see you both. Your concern is valid though.
wXh4QpaYaa	It's not a matter of allowing, but more of a matter of approval. They can't disallow me to get married, but they can sure as heck tell me that they don't like it at all.    I'm married to a mexican, and I'm about as white as they come. They don't care that he's mexican, they care that he treats me with respect and loves me.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	they cant tell me who and who not to marry     my parents might frown on it but they wouldnt and couldnt forbid me from doing it.     mostly they care about education tho. a well educated person is more important to them than a caucasion dude|`|9383de8d1e0067ca2e8ae7245d9fbdb3aa	NO they would not!!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	An adult doesn't need their parents permission to marry anybody.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	only because they are my parents. I married outside of my race I am white he was a Mexican. I thought I loved him although my father always told me otherwise( but I never listened to him). My dad was of course right. I was 19 at the time I am now 27 and truly understand that most of the time parents are right. I did not love the guy I married until later we just got married because I was pregnant (now divorced). If you love this guy you are talking about than be with him and love him and worry about the rest another time. your parents will still love you and support you although they will not agree with your decision. My aunt is white she married a black man and had 3 children with him. It wasn't until recently that he was allowed at her moms house for holidays or anything else. I always thought that was wrong but that's how it worked out. My family never turned my ex husband away but they never really liked him and I understand why now.|`|u9EsbutJaa	lets see i am over 21 there is nothing my parents could do about who i marry, that's just part of being an adult. when you grow up you will find that you don't always have your parents around to tell you how to behave|`|EzZk2pyNaa	She wouldn't have any choice, because I'm almost 28 yrs. old.|`|rYWeCH0saa	Maybe they wouldn't like it, but they couldn't do anything about it.|`|TkUF1PI4aa	NO.

QxhZNMstaa	Dear friend, you wanted to plan your family, however without knowledge of contraception it is going to happen this way only. But why so negative attitude. Be happy you can very well enjoy your life even as parent also. You love your wife therefore now do not regret and pay more attention to her as she will be needing it more now. Keep her happy and be positive.|`|AA12346188	You are trying to buy the ticket after the train is left the station.|`|5YFgZCEKaa	my sincere advise is to the child,i wish this child brings prosperity to your life.don't even think of abortion.i did the same and now i am repenting.  why do you think that you cant enjoy after becoming parents.go for it.  you could have used contraceptive but now its too late.its gods will dont disobey it.|`|HAk6iROaaa	Have you people not heard of contraception?   Do you not take precautions?   Not clever.....|`|8nLuyDmPaa	There are personal choices to make.  Being a parent is not for everyone, but it is a wonderful and all consuming experience.    Your life WILL change even before your child is even born.  After the baby is here, your life will be about the baby.  Your wife's life will be about the baby.  Some of the things you think is important now will be laughable later.    After a year or two, if you do not have another child, it will be easier to include the child in travel plans, or find someone that would be able to keep them for a few days.    I could say it is all going to be wonderful.  It's not.  You will miss the freedom.  You will miss the ability to just sit around at home, and not worry about anything.    Being a parent is a full time job.  I personally think it is well worth the experience, but if you are not a responsible, mature minded person, it can be a very eye opening experience which may take a lot of getting used to.|`|RUTQTgCyaa	Take my advice look at this as nothing but a blessing because that is exactly what it is. My husband and I said almost the exact same thing...more me than him. We wanted to wait and enjoy each other and now fast forward 5 years we have not been able to conceive. So don't dwell on the things that you think you missed out on, think of all the things that you have to look forward too. A bunch of firsts and maybe even a jr. And who's to say that you won't be able to still travel and enjoy each other. If you stop living then having the child didn't cause that...you did. Take the baby with you or utilize the grandparents...believe me they will love it.|`|BfDM12ptaa	dont potray child as a 'disturbance',  u will find it xciting ones u travel with the baby,u will enjoy the company and u will not want to go anywhere without u r little one...trust me...  me and my husband travel with our kid all the time is always fun!  yes ,if u think its gonna b tough then it is tough..but just think its YOUR BABY....how in the world can it be a barrier to u???uh???|`|bouoX28Taa	Well, have yall talked about it? The pregnancy? Life isnt what we planned- most of the time not what we hoped for but through it all- you have already committed to her- talk it out- stick with your decision and make the best of your situations. Good luck|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	Most of our lives don't turn out as we plan. It is quite possible that any number of things could have interfered with the rest of your planned years of travel. Health or financial difficulties are 2 examples that pop into mind.  How far along is the pregnancy? Personally I am opposed to late term abortions, but that is everyone's decision to make. A better option if you are unwilling to keep the baby is to put it up for adoption.  But quite honestly, I think at this point you should take the hand that life has dealt you. You can still travel and enjoy nature, just in different ways than when you were childless. When the baby is a little older you can go camping, go to nature centers, take a family cruise (Disney cruises are supposed to be great family cruises), etc.  You are not a teenager who may not have had all the facts at your disposal. You knew what your options were with regards to contraception. I would recommend taking the responsibility for your actions and keeping the baby. I assure you you can still enjoy life!|`|ZgeTZlDsaa	hari, your wife is too lucky to have a husband like you! so caring! see if ur wife is normal n healthy to deliver this baby then u should happily go for it. see it is said that u should have ur first baby and do not abort it as ur wife can have complications in her later pregnancy. you have enjoyed one year of ur married life, thats enough. u cannot just kill that life who has to see this world just for ur enjoyment. dont be so selfish! welcome that baby with all ur love as the gift of GOD. pls dont kill it !!!!!!!!!!!  best wishes for that gift !  happy parenting!|`|tcFg1gWjaa	Life will be different now, that's for sure. Don't give up on enjoying your life! You child will bring so much joy to your life, you will be surprised. The spontaneity will be gone, but you will appreciate life more when you two get little moments alone, or plan for little getaways. Life has a way of balancing itself out. Think about what your gaining and not what you THINK your going to miss.  Congratulations!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I know that you are sad about not accomplishing all the things you wanted to do, but you'll get past that when you see that bundle of joy. Yes, life will change for now, but the dream doesn't have to go away...it just has to be postponed for a few years. Grandparents will be around so you can take various trips now and then, but now you'll have something to look forward to when you retire. It will be ok, so cheer up!|`|6p0Gqm10aa	It is great having a baby, why you think that you won't enjoy after a baby, when your baby is born take it along with you on hill stations, beaches and places you want to visit, baby will also love it. Babies are really cute, and only lucky people have it. I can say this to you as I do not have a baby, I cry for it. So, take care of your wife and let the baby come.|`|MIjednAMaa	Don't be silly, U would have proud  for going to be parent. Still U can enjoy ur life with ur child also, because kids r so qute and lovely.  When u enjoy ur life with child u will forget ur wife's love.|`|62f0f93f9e81c6452c048e86e6fb495baa	Count it a blessing! Life does not have to stop because you have children as a matter of fact it probably just begins. You will still be able to do a lot of things after a couple years and quite honestly may find them more enjoyable with that someone else to look in awe as you and your wife will on your explorations, in short make it a great thing that your having a child sounds like the there's really no option in the matter. God Bless!!|`|QClFoSNhaa	well if you wait for the perfect time to have kids you would never have them. I agree you should waait and enjoy your time together. Have you ever thought that this might just be gods will maybe its just what he wanted. I know from experience once you see the child you will fall in love with it and wonder why you even waited that long especially after you bring the child home. Its a different kind of love one you will never know without having a child. I have 5 kids and me and my husband still travel and have time for each other its hard but we do it.|`|JLQMyKCvaa	u r not going to miss none of that when u see your new baby!  your gonna think when u can get 4hours of sleep... the last thing on your mind is traveling and u r still going to see new places just that these places are going to be crowed with other kids!!!! soooo you HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU CAME IN HER LEARN TO SPIT OUT OR WEAR A CONDOM|`|UYTdVcDkaa	If you wait until it is convenient and fits your plans, chances are you will never have a baby.  Between car payments/repair, home repair, mortgage, unexpected medical, there's always something.  My parents weren't planning on have in children right away after marriage either. 21 months later, I came along.  I was such a huge blessing, they had another child (oddly enough 21 months after my birthday).  A lot of their dreams were put on hold until we all (three of us) moved out.  Some of their hopes will never be realized.  Yet they have no regrets, at least not when it comes to having me.  Did I mention I was a blessing?    When the doctor places that newborn baby in your arms, tears of joy will spring from your eyes when you look at it and your wife.|`|GJ3s6g2laa	Now thats the time to enjoy with the baby u can have the baby now and then dont go for the other baby or try for the other baby after 6-7 years thats how u guys will be ablt to enjoy having a baby... .and in futur use condoms.. today whole world knows about it even a small kid knows about it I donno what kept you back in using that... and if this is how u both kept going no matter u would be soon enjoying with 4-5 kids
5oj5YfKMaa	First off...I have genital herpes and my wife doesn't! People are naive and stupid, if they actually did research they would find out the most common transfer of the virus is oral herpes to genital...YES, THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS...PEOPLE WITH ORAL HERPES HSV1 GOING DOWN TOWN ON SOMEONE AND GIVING IT TO THEM! Another fact is that 90% of adults, people ages 14-60, HAVE oral herpes. So you see chances are you WILL come across someone who has it at some point in time again if you are dating, at least this guy was HONEST enough to tell you like I was to my wife...OH, AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH MY WIFE FOR OVER 5 YEARS WITHOUT CONDOMS AND SHE HAS NEVER CONTRACTED THE VIRUS SO IT CAN BE DONE PEOPLE! Talk to a doctor not ignorant people in here about herpes! Most people who have this and know it will not tell the other person they have it. It's WAY MORE common then people would like to admit, but don't be like most and stick your head in the sand and ignore it...you could have a connection with this guy and leave him because of hsv2 and then meet another guy who is not honest and contract it. I know people that this has happened too. It's out there!|`|VyU2d8Ohaa	if you really care/love him then stay with him. have him to go to the doctor and be treated but if it happen again i would be out the door.|`|P9wE9XZlaa	Well let him take meds for it first them do the deed..  go to docs togather and talk about it|`|U1WUNCwLaa	you dont have to have sex to be with someone or to love them, why dont you hold out on the sex and just date?|`|5jMNBO2naa	you are naive    at 19 you know nothing of love  only feelings that seem like love    herpes, as you know, has no cure  it can only be controlled, but he has it for life|`|9aJOQtw8aa	herpes has no cure. I would stay away from him. As hard as that sounds. He needs to be with a girl that already has the virus. You are 19, and have your whole life ahead of you.|`|RUTQTgCyaa	You need to ask yourself if you could handle being diagnosed with herpes. If you think you can handle that then have at it...but realize that if this relationship doesn't work out then you will always be connected to this person and not in the most flattering of ways. And at 19 years old sometimes love can be very fleeting. This is also something that you would have to explain to the next person you get involved with. Just be careful and think it through thoroughly. By the way...herpes does not have a cure...you can take meds for it but it never fully goes away just through a dormant phase.|`|ui5uEr5Oaa	well asuming he didnt get it from you mabye he was cheating on you so you may should dump his azz|`|QClFoSNhaa	if your happy and you already had sex there is a med for this and you caan take that. being happy means alot|`|VXvEN6dvaa	If you feel uneasy just say "lets be friends" it's not worth you risking your health.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	You are just 19.|`|aq6z5AF1aa	Leave him. You will not be happy with him and if you do get herpes you will be even more miserable, and it will be for the rest of your life. Think about that for a minute. Leave him now.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Make him take his Valtrex and just date the man.|`|6rOJZxxSaa	I would not stay with him. The risk is bad. And what if you get herpes and want children in the future? There are plenty of men out there without herpes who you will fall in love with.|`|EeSFTxCuaa	can't herpes be treated?|`|0CtEr0Vbaa	If your thinking that he might not be the one than he probably isnt. From the first time I met my husband (almost 5 years ago) I knew that we were going to be together. We are happily married with 1 son, and I wouldnt have it any other way. There are more fish in the see.|`|ZVb8azf2aa	RUN!  You don't need that you're too young.  If it you lose the man you keep the disease if you contract it.  Even if it worked out and you guys got married in the future eventually you'd probably end up catching it from him and being very uncomfortable and if you go to have kids it's sure to cause problems.  Find someone clean.  Chances are sleeping around is how he caught it in the first place.|`|6H2VMBfoaa	Love is love, if you love him then you can over look that you know he has herpes.If you leave him you will be sad. You dont have to have sex right away in a relationship, if he loves you then he wont force that either. IF he is "the one" for you and you find that later on, then you can make the decision of how you both can deal with this. There are meds he can take, and theres always a condom..|`|1HWC5uEDaa	well sex isnt everything in a relationship and if the love is ****** then the sex by all means stay with him that disease shouldnt stop you from loving him and well if he feels the same way you do as you do for him nothing should come in between you guys but if you feel he isnt the one then its up to you to take the choice of being with him or not..as for the engagement well that could wait until you guys are fully ready to commit to something like that then take a step further but for now worry about this situation.|`|W5Y30FHcaa	Herpes has a 98.5814 mortality rate and it can evolve into cancer or aids!
rQfzifT7aa	I would say for a woman to admit to an affair and say it is over then it is more than likely over.    I cheated on both of my ex husbands time and time again because they were not giving me the attention that I thought I needed. It is very disappointing to want to be with someone and feel they don't want you back. Eventually you give up and eventually someone comes along to take care of what is not being taken care of at home.  That is what happened to me.    I cannot say for sure that you or her will ever find happiness again. Once the damage has been done unless you can make a fresh start then it will ultimately end in disaster. And that means you have to forgive her and move past it. And not constantly dwell on, "Is she at work flirting with him?" or "Are they meeting after work" if she is late or whatever the scenario may be. That is no kind of life to live for you.  I can however offer you some advice on where to start.  Remember when you first met your wife...  What did you like about her?  Find those feelings again.  Spend time alone just the two of you.  Make her feel like she is the most important thing in your life.  When you tell her you love her and you care for her say it with meaning so she knows you are telling her the truth.  Along with all these words goes action.  Show her that you love her by ways that make her feel special. Even if you pick her up a little dollar item. At least she knows that you were out and you were thinking about her.  She should be giving you back attention as well.  She should beg for your forgivness and be thankful that you are still staying with her.    You said you made the decision to stay with her because you didn't want them together and if you dumped her that would mean you approved of what they done.   Nowhere in there did I hear that you loved her and wanted to be with her.    I feel as if you don't love her then you shouldn't stay with them.  And as far as approving, I am thinking that by staying your are more approving of what they have done.  Because you are saying okay this has happened and we can continue on.   By chance if it happened again, are you still going to stay. If so then I would think you are approving of the affair.    I am sure that you are hurt as anyone would be and I hope that you can get past this. Betrayal is a hard thing to over come. I know this is sorta long but I've got lots of experience. Have been on both sides of the fence.    I know they say once a cheater, always a cheater. That is not so.       Good Luck to you|`|KQJPWWjeaa	It's definitely over.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Most of the time when women admit to an affair, it's already over.|`|cUwbfosuaa	Why would you call those woman honest when they had an affair?|`|kHRD7uUAaa	there are no women on this site that has ever had an affair.  Haven't you read the answers when someone says they are seeing a married man how all the women speak out and they are all perfect and would never ever do such a thing.|`|elhcuN19aa	Women can keep it a secret trust me.....  My ex cheated on me and acted like I would not find out lol|`|n3pkbRizaa	Once a cheat always a cheat|`|HlrZEXJKaa	I agree with the first response
MXtpR1lAaa	He's so cute! Umm he's a 7.4, I can't see why he can't get a girl!|`|ezI5HwRWaa	He's cute! Sorry I don't rate. If he had an awesome personality I wouldn't care if he was short. He'll find an awesome girl. =)    He just needs to stay confident with himself and wait for her to come. Ik now some cute, awesome guys who've never had a girlfriend before, so it's not a big deal.|`|mmKHDMhxaa	awww he's a cutie! i'd give him a.....8 or 9 i love his hair! haha i love hair like his! im short too so i have no prob w/ shortness! haha and personality is key! i love his eyes too. he sounds amazing! :)|`|AA11033942	Do you remember a film called "When Harry met Sally" with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, one of the things he said - check the scenes in YouTube and information on IMDB, I'm just going on memory here - is "men and women cannot be friends without the sex getting in the way". If he's your best friend then keep it that way and if you want to remain real friends for life, then keep the friendship platonic not sexual.    Don't take this as an insult on his behalf (it's certainly not aimed that way, he'll probably be more annoyed at you for posting it up in the first place) but your friend looks like I did when I was 14 or 15, which was a while ago now. I'm sure he's probably older than that...
lMZQJEsKaa	Don't be overly anxious to please him, but do what you want to do.  If he's playing hard to get, then he's either immature or a game-player.  Either way, you probably don't want him.  (I think it's okay to tell him nicely that you don't want to play games and see how he reacts.)|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	say you'll think about it and see what plans you have. but go to his house at the end.
E2ludi7xaa	well im 14 so im saying this in the view of a young teen.  - he will stare at you ALOT  -everytime you smile or laugh he stares at you  -his friends talk about you all time  -he trys to impress you  -when you smile at him he gives you a big smile and a little giggle  -he will do anything to get your attention  -he gets jelous when you talk to other guys  - he will watch you when you walk down the hallway  -he pays attention to wat you say  -his friends will ask you if you like him  -he will brag alot about how you like him|`|6JgKGDK1aa	If they keep staring at you.|`|q3rDROxgaa	somthing cool about us girls is that we just knoww if a guy likes us its like a girls 6 sence lol u should trust it lol|`|nO2vflnPaa	Hopefully he'd have the gonads to tell me|`|Yu5AfOlXaa	It's hard to determine weather a guy likes you or is just trying to get in your pants.    For the most part, you can tell by the little things.|`|pcIkr0mqaa	Okay.Ive often found myself In this kind of situation. So these following things are things that Ive picked up on when Im trying to find out if a guy likes you.  -He starts a random conversation with you out of no where a lot of the time.  -He'll find a way to touch you.Hair,thigh,face etc.  -He looks at you a lot.  -His friends look at you longer than they usually do in the hallway or work or whatever.  -He says goodbye last all of the time.  -If you bring up another guy around him, he pretends its nothing,when to him It really is.  -Or if he flirts. You think It may be hard to tell when he is,but honestly every girl has a gut feeling when someone is flirting with her or likes her.  Hope I helped =]    goodluck|`|Nk1CiR0Vaa	There isn't really a definitive answer to this question because all guys behave differently and some are much flirtier than others. If he likes you, you probably know already. Call it female intuition. The only way to properly find out is to tell him you like him and see what he says.
l7Qvbw9maa	Military pays for everything. They will even pack up all your stuff. It's almost painless. All you have to do is schedule a time for the movers to come out and watch them pack your household goods.    Make sure you take pictures of any important items, sometimes they end up missing. The military will pay for them as long as you can prove you owned it and it was packed.    I was in 21 years and moved ALOT!    Good LUCK and support your man..Mail and care packages do wonders!|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I'm married to an air force guy. and they didn't pay to move my stuff.   the way we got around that was.    When TMO came to get my husbands things from his parents house, I had my things there as well. And pretended like they were his. and they moved them anyways. They do have a limit on the weight. But you can still fit tons of stuff in there.     and as far as moving in with him. once he gets sent to his duty station they will put him in a room until there is a house on base that is open. this is something he needs to tell them, he needs to inform them that he's married, and needs a home on base. he will have to show them your marriage license.          **** the military ONLY pays for her things to be moved as well, if they are already married. She's not married yet. So her things WILL NOT be moved for free by the military!@!!!!!!!|`|AaZCmTGUaa	If you get married before his orders are cut to go to the new duty station they should (or you get the orders modified before he moves). But most likely you will have to pay for it and MAYBE be reimbursed for your expenses.   Yes there is a maximum allowance as to what they will move for you but I am not quite sure how much it is. We never even get close to it which is why I haven't bothered.     This is the Army, perhaps the AF does things differently. But I doubt it.     From my personal experience. Get the regulation that specifies your situation. Do not rely on what people tell you, even the people who work at the transportation office. That is a very important advice, a MUST KNOW when you become a member of the military family. These people often don't know, don't want to know, don't care ...   Triple check every information you get.|`|3941bac2b250be66b0869549f868e9b4aa	Hey there!    First of all congrats!    Then for ur Q, the airforce pays for EVERYTHING at least overseas Housing, moving (there is no limit i know of, correct me if i'm wrong).  My parents have moved EVERYTING (beds, tv racks, shelves) from Spain to the US, from the US to Germany with no problem, I think they even ship the car...
vAR22hz4aa	ask him.
AA10837061	Nope. Just the USPS makes more money.    Wrong category also.
4drQ38qZaa	There really is no correct way. Whatever you two are comfortable that is how. I always think the boy's hand should go on top of the girl's hand but my boyfriend likes it vice versea so I go with that. If you two did that, that might have been why. If you two cupped hands that too. But yeah.    The types I know of is:    Interlocked (laced) fingers  Cupped Hands  Holding pinkies|`|mLH2NjDYaa	You mean when walking?    If so his hand needs to be palm down, yours palm up, he leads you. But that is old, do what feels comfortable for the two of you.
MDtBuOaMaa	lol no way awesome prank. hope it takes them a while to guess.|`|0fTAWpsXaa	as long as  you eventually tell them its you youre fine. i do it all the time. its hilarious!!!! have fun!|`|PLEIYAnAaa	its not super creepy.  creeper is a fourty year old man texting kids and doing that.  what you're doing is kinda what a lot of girls do. haha  but it is kind of weird and they may either think its funny or they'll think you guys are annoying.
YadG5xnJaa	Well if you're really close to that guy and you tell him almost everything and you trust him a lot...that could make a guy look over you as a big brother.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I look out a friend of mine so she was a sister to me you would say.  Always do favours for her even the smallest details, protect her and sacrifice for her happiness.  I would regret myself and my life if something happened to her.|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Be kinda nice but not to nice and give him favors.|`|w74qWx0raa	You could of reminded him of someone he knew.|`|gsem4EnYaa	wow hmm tough question LOL|`|e2H0qLH8aa	Uh... it's different for everyone. Usually the way it works is if you like a person, just hang around them as they feel comfortable. Things will progress naturally as you get to know each other. Trying to force a relationship to adhere to certain "rules" that you have outlined in your head is a recipe for disaster. If you like him, and he thinks of you like a sister, go with it. If you want to kiss him, go for it...|`|MDtBuOaMaa	usually we (guys) are protective of a girl because either we are jealous of the girls current boyfriend or we do that to get the girl to like us. so if you don't like him doing that just tell him and he'll stop.|`|SZnU7RXuaa	if theyre not popular then they're looking out for u
QsbB6vkoaa	look when you are young you think that you school friendships are very important, but once you grow up you all start separating and all that's left for you are your family members, co-workers and occasionally a really good friend from high school, i think you should stick to your group and let your other friend have her independence, if she's only nice to you when she's not with her other friends she's not such a good friend is she? surround yourself with positive people and true friends.  i hardly ever speak to my high-school friends even though we were very close, it's just a part of growing up.
d4fadwVKaa	hey bro, dont get discouraged by that. shes a rude b**** for saying something like that... shy guys may not get too many girls in highschool but when you get older you can actually get into a real relationship that lasts because shy guys usually arent jerks|`|idmz2tvraa	Not true. Shy guys are usually nicer and smarter. She's just rude for saying that.|`|FZMVjKweaa	oo yeah man u gotta get some dude i suggested finding some crappy chicks practicing with them and getting more comfortable then becoming ga lion in the jungle
fGE7hL12aa	Because he didn't really call to see what was for dinner.     He just called to hear your voice.    (You still might want to have him committed. It's your call.)|`|RBQrgByeaa	Well, he's at work. Only so much conversation he can have there. It's his way of saying he misses you.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	He forgot which wife he had already called!!      Quick--call the polygamy police!|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Sounds Like he Needs to Set the Pipe Down for awhile|`|1nk8WPrtaa	That's funny because I baked a chicken for dinner tonight too!!|`|qdPtCBJeaa	Make up a different menu every time he calls|`|fHfVRcqbaa	You know he wasn't listening the first time, even though he was the one who asked.|`|AABCy5mQaa	Lol. Boy you are on a roll tonight. Men are just annoying and their brains do not function like us women.|`|AA12272885	He has two wives, and accidentally called you twice instead of calling the other one.  He was going home to whichever dinner sounded the best.|`|C5UUltHtaa	ha yea I'm afraid to say that supports the saying men don't listen.  His brain was multitasking.  I would ask him to repeat what you said back to you so you both would know what you said and maybe he'll remember better and also you will know what he heard from you.  Give him the 5 years before being committed lol|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Probably the same reason my husband asks me where his wallet is every day when I never touch it. You got me.|`|y9CgveCGaa	He was looking for something to say the first time.  He wasn't listenening and was distracted.
qHDkCC2Caa	screamer. but lately I gotta keep it low cuz my roomie is right there...|`|AA11119892	lol, SCREAMER!!|`|fMpKj0DYaa	I am a screamer, unless his parents are in the next room.|`|AkTw3RQuaa	YEAH  I scream lke a banshee in bed  I am verrrry sensitive  My 5 senses kick in like crazzzzzy  If the guy is GIB (good in bed) any chick will scream with delight !|`|0zW3gWfEaa	.....    aint that a little bit personal?|`|0fVtHNtmaa	I do just enough. Not too much and not too little.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	i try not to, but when i get in he moment i can't help myself|`|vCsSOmVOaa	screamer because its recently REALLY good|`|AA10494884	Man i cant believe that many girls answered keep pimpin... pimpin LoL I cant answer but i will say that the better you perform the louder the ovation|`|abx5VNsOaa	Yes,i let it all come out.!!|`|iHtvljQGaa	SQUIRTER
demWmz6jaa	maybe he needs space. he might want to experience new things. or hes falling out of love. a guy should always appreciate his girlfriend. i hope you find someone better that will always be there for you, or i hope your bf realizes what he has before its gone.
xvCvd5xhaa	I can help ya. :) Just walk up to her with your head up, be confident, don't be shy, smile at her and say her name, then say, I was wondering if you would go out with me to the Valentines Day Dance, and give her a rose, girls like that stuff. I would. :) Good luck. Don't do it when her friends around, catch her when she's alone.
WXwVuctfaa	Depends, If its EVERY time it sounds like he's horny and may be lust more than liking / love.
glPyjitIaa	one day you'll be HAPPENING to walk into the library/ coffee shop/ grocery store/ parking lot and meet the most beautiful girl you've ever met, you'll talk to her and she'll smile at you and you get her number  you become friends  you ask her out  you fall in love with her  and then....you won't need to look anymore|`|IRAtmZhTaa	find a diff hang out spot man|`|kG6VWsGvaa	They're there, waiting for you.

If is your case, I'm sure you're not gonna find a good girl cause that sounds like you go out with a girl and then you're gonna dump her when you  get bored.     If not, sorry I don't know what else to think. Just be a good person and you'll find a good girl.
sGvEU9j8aa	you have to put yourself out there...talk to random ppl...make new friends, talk to the people around you in class..  i went thro something similar to that.  i used to be extremely outgoing 6th grade started i got really shy, new school...etc etc..  my best friend brought me out of my shell in 8th grade and brought me back to the person i really was...she moved away...after 8th gradee  i started hs without her...  i really put myeslf out there, i knew i couldnt go back...  i didnt have any friends beside her, but i talked to the ppl around me, really got ouit there...and now i am so much more happy with myself.
EmWbvWEQaa	i like guys who don't have huge legs and they have to have hair because i'm not gonna go out with no fag. but they can't be fat either. and i don't want him to be little and weak either though. i like tall guys but being a short person really it doesnt matter either way. heck i actually prefer short guys a lot. Oh well it doesnt matter. So what you got against short legs dude?|`|zPFclJznaa	i dont think so... not to me anyway...|`|AA10912960	I like nice looking legs, shaved legs|`|LIf59lyfaa	i like mucsular legs

I just got through watching the Golota-Ruiz on my boxing DVD collection and after watching John Ruiz fight for twelve rounds I needed a good laugh.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Xyy7KHURaa	Because they are affrad of rejection. If you really want them to talk to you then step it up a notch. They might be a little shy, so maybe you need to make it clear to them that you are somewhat into them. Smile at them, walk past them more, maybe even say hi to them. That might be a good start. Put yourself in our shoes, it's harder than you think.
Ef6VGCaWaa	Tell him that you want to be more. I tried the whole friends with benefits before, and I just ended up getting hurt because I never told him how I actually felt , so he went off and hooked up with other girls , and since were weren't dating , or in a relationship , I couldn't say anything . You should just tell him how you feel .|`|oidfmtnYaa	kablah|`|igBds5Lhaa	ask him out.  or just wait until someone else comes along that sees how great you are and will claim you as his because right now even though your seeing this guy your a free agent.|`|9w8EW24daa	honesty is the best policy! just talk to him
AA10604300	I thank you that you for bearing witness to my   subjection to the teachings of the Lord Jesus my Saviour.    that is what a born again Christian would write,    Or  I would write,     I thank the Lord Jesus for saving me and giving me eternal life, with the forgiveness of my sins.    I thank you also for the kind gift you gave as I celebrate my life with the Lord.
ovIxSVKbaa	in real life **** and over the phone just talk about each other =P|`|zGi9Wag3aa	Guaranteeing everyone their civil liberties. oooooh yeah|`|7FksHGaWaa	my ear turns me on
xEJm0NCiaa	1) good grades? , sure. by more developed, im sure you meant boobs, lmao, ermmm, thats something a guy from the 8th would look for.    2) to me personally, height doesn't matter, cuz im short, lol.    3) eyes, blue or hazel (sweet). hair, depends on eye colour, blonde goes well with blue eyes, and brunnetes and browns and blacks go well with hazel.|`|FC378Lcraa	1) Certainly not grades, just any good looking girls who made themselves accessible, as in they were happy to talk to guys and not just hang out with their lady friends.    2) Height I've never found to be all that important, as long as the girl isn't a dwarf or a giantess it's all good.    3) I like a girl with a cute face more than classicly beautiful if that makes sense, piercing Blue eyes are amazing, but green and brown are fine also, Hair colour and length isn't important to me so much as originality, every girl I see seems to wear the same haircut and style, be creative, be artsy!|`|mbUUr6Maaa	1) Well when i was younger i went for the girls who looked more grown up their grades never bothered me.  2) I never went for a girl taller than me but some people don't mind it.  3) i look for the girls eyes any color just nice eyes and long dark hair.|`|SLryl0CMaa	when i was younger i wasnt as much concerned about girls as now but i looked for a girl that was nice pretty and had common interests. i liked it if she was shorter, taller would be ok though  hazel eyes dark brown hair and kinda long
ptclgKl5aa	Short girls are fine, but I'm 6'7" so it would be awesome to have a girl that's 5'6" to 6'2".  Anywhere in that range would be ideal.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	hey i'm 4'11! i tink the guys only like the tall girls for their legs but the shorter girls are more fun to hug and pick up adn stuff.|`|HtCKBRv1aa	I'm 5'8 and for me the perfect height for a girlfriend is 5'2 to 5'4.|`|87CAVhs2aa	Well that would sure help me out!    I think I've reached 5 ft....|`|KzkErmaaaa	yeah i think short girls are cute.|`|YjuVJbxSaa	height dose'nt matter|`|ryg28eX7aa	as attractiveness goes, the height isn't that important. but i do like to be kinda taller. i can see what ur friend means. i'm 5'7, so i'm pretty average. but really, height doesn't matter. i think a pretty face is my favorite PHYSICAL feature. but the physical features mean squat in the end. this is gonna sound cheesy, but its what's inside that counts to me|`|XYCimJONaa	I find taller girls more attractive considering I'm 6'7 and I dont want to date someone a foot and a half shorter,|`|Gj3FQ5ZHaa	it doesn't really matter to me as long as they have a good personality and they are attractive, but i guess ideally i'd like someone to be right around my hieght.  the only think is. im 5'7" so taller girls don't usually like me cuz they have a thing about only dating guys that are significantly taller than them|`|jeHTjvbaaa	I like taller girls better because I've dated too many short girls (5'4 and under) in the past an it's soooooooooooo Fing annoying at times.  So ya tall girls are more attractive =P P.S. I'm 6'5 so you can see how dating a girl who is 5'0 would get annoying.
MVxFOI5naa	Take your time when selecting a partner and don't be in  a hurry to marry that person.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	I would never trust a crazy Christian Fundy in a million years...especially a nutjob preacher like him.    Everyone who knew about that guy before he got caught knew there was something wrong with him and could have predicted he was a homo.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Sometimes we look too hard and find more negativity than we want.|`|naequcqlaa	You simply take your time in selecting your mate.  Go w/him a decent length of time & don't rush into anything.  You have plenty of time.  Get to know his family & all of his friends.  Your friends are a reflection of you & the choice of the company you choose to keep.  Yes, there w/always be that oddball present, but if you truly get to know the person well  I feel you won't be wrong.   All in all, make the best judgment you can & take your time in making it.  If you can, ask about his tho'ts on children.  Get as much out in the open as you can to find out if he in fact is the rite person for you.  I truly think you'll know this person pretty well.  All the best to you...:)|`|rm1oLtNtaa	You can't trust anyone anymore.. you have to watch out for yourself..  whether they show up gay, or cheaters, users , and abusers....     How do you find nice straight people.. time, do what your gut tells you.. and your heart will follow.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	When I was single - I had the same problem - only I was a male looking for a woman.  Not a girl.  Not a one night stand.  Not a "girl gone crazy".    But someone who had some sense, wasn't into drugs and who would not tell me to drop my pants the first time we went out (I hated feeling like I was just the "next " person in line for sex).    After several years of this, I finally wised up and started to be more selective in who I became friends with.  And where I went and what I did to meet people.    Eventually found someone.  And have been married now (package deal - I walked into a wife and 2 teenagers) for 22 years.      But it is hard to find someone who is honest.    I used to get told that my problem was I was too nice a guy.  Had a girl tell me once, that she just wanted to "teach me a lesson - that I should not trust people".  She did.  It took me years to get to where I could trust anyone.  Very lonely years (I was living in a town far from where I grew up and knew people).  I grew very depressed because of the inability to find anyone.
YGZuAl2Caa	This is really sweet. If you really like it, go ahead, talk to her. I would stick to talking with her in person, and not on IM, since a person's character tends to change on the internet.     As you your second paragraph, I would start with something simple, like maybe a "Did you hear about the new movie that came out?" or "Do you think it's going to snow tomorrow?" Listen to her reasons, don't butt in, and tell her what you think after she's done talking. Make her giggle. Don't be rude. DO NOT ignore her friends, but DO give the girl way more attention than her friends, sending a clear message that you're only interested in her. Don't forget to smile. Make sure you're clean and smell nice, maybe some cologne. Don't overdo it though. Watch her without her knowing, find out her likes and dislikes now, not a year ago. At lunch, come walk by her table, and maybe join in some conversation. DON'T sit down on the first day though, make her want you there. Above all, if she's not interested, don't stalk or make her uncomfortable.  Just be yourself. Don't change yourself for her.|`|VE7h6R2daa	how old are you and dont worry im not a stalker im only 12|`|h8JBSqfkaa	Well first of all you should make an effort of trying to talk to her again. Ask her a question like do u know where this teacher is? and then when she says no or yes be like wow its been a while... and then continue on from there. Don't ask her out the first time u talk. talk to her for at least a week before u do. oh and always ask her out face to face. u look like chicken sheit if u ask her out any other way. good luck =)|`|02RiO34Naa	Whats wrong with making it obvious that you want to talk to her? Nothing wrong with that.    Bite the bullet and just do it.    The worst thing she can do is say she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you.|`|BgyN7oocaa	be a man and take initiative. quit being a wuss and talk to her in person. i used to just talk online because i was shy, but found out if you act yourself and the girl doesn't like you - believe me, it wasn't meant to be. just be yourself and sum up some courage to talk to her in person. you could also figure out if she likes you from this fun site...    http://willshelike.me|`|n8nGuu70aa	well maybe just tell one of her friends, and she'll help u, she would tell the truth to her friend and then her friend can help u figure this all out.|`|oidfmtnYaa	fart near her    the ladies like the smell of farts    it attracts them|`|vUoT27dqaa	what do u mean by write as much *** you can. if u like someone talk to her and see how she responds. if she is kind of shy too then she definitely likes you or when she starts holding her necklace or hair does also a good sign. go for it ***, u got nothing to lose|`|sWgekFwaaa	telll her in person, and not online and just tell her up front "i like u" nothing fancy or confusing, plain and simple is the best way. good luck :)|`|aUIsuOEaaa	hmm.i don't get why she would block you.maybe write her a sweet note and a rose or something.sounds sweet.
2b7NEgyMaa	Ask her out..may be u can start with something not too obvious by asking her whether she has facebook or my space account or email.email add. At least u can find out wht's her interest..then u can start asking her out or go 4 a drink n talk abt wht she's into  n urs.good luck|`|LkRivHpTaa	alright whatyou do is take her phone and put your number in it then you call her and ask her if she ants to go to your nieghborhood park and swing at nighttime then you make out and maybe bang
yQdA5rHnaa	if you have different goals in life, the relationship won't work.  If she wants kids and you don't one of you is always going to be unhappy.|`|q4kEXT9maa	She loved you and you loved her....You just werent what she was looking for.  It may have hurt both you and her, but she did the right thing.....the mature thing if you will.  So many ppl stick with their significant other when they want two totally different things out of life and it ends up not working out in the long run.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Having kids is a big yes or no for people, one of those tihs sry to say you really do have to agree on to be in a perma. rs. If she wanted kids and you dont sorry to say you arnt compatible.|`|X8BJ5rSSaa	well if she wants kids and you don't want to its reasonable for you to want someone who does, she needs someone who wants similar things in life, someone that will help her carry out what she wants to do in life. Ofcoarse she loved you all this time, she wouldn't of wasted 3 years if she didn't, but i think she thought in time u'd come around and want kids eventually.|`|tvwmiDwRaa	I personally think that is a big reason to break up but you should try talking to the person and figure a way to live with the decision if you really love her|`|LAqn2toCaa	No, I'm sure your relationship was real. 3 years is a long time to commit to one person.   Sounds like she knows what she wants out of life and doesn't think you can give it to her. If my now husband would have told me he never wanted kids from the start, I wouldn't have dated him much longer either. I've always known I'd want kids.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	No, not wanting kids is a fair reason to break up with someone.  She is looking for someone to be serious about and get married and have kids.  You don't want kids.  She wants a life with children in it.      It's good that she knew herself well enough to know that was what she wanted and she didn't waste her and your time trying to change your mind.    when a person who wants children is with  a person who doesn't want children, then they need to decide how they feel about the person they are with and to figure out if they will regret giving up children to be with this person.      She decided that she wanted children more than she wanted you.  It doesn't mean she didn't love you at all, it just means she loves children more and the reason she stuck around so long was that she probably had hoped you would change your mind.    It sucks but at least she was honest with herself and didn't try to fool herself into thinking you would change your mind.  Because had she stayed with you, she would have made your life miserable and eventually left you anyway because she wanted children or she would have got pregnant and forced you to become a parent against your will and still destroyed your relationship.    Since you know you don't want to be a parent, continue being honest with the women you date.  There are women out there who don't want children or who would be willing to give up the prospect of children to be with you.    Good Luck.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	im sure that she loved you or she still does.  having kids is probably really important to her and its ovb a deal breaker.
dz7ZepS4aa	I like it when someone is interested and asks questions.....but that is just me
Ej0E4RPcaa	I think it is. So far, I've been right. =]|`|klcqgST9aa	Probably, but there's always a small chance they don't, so be aware.|`|ySvWezDdaa	honestly if you're a guy, it can be a little more difficult to tell (so i've heard).  girls usually can tell, but for you, i'd say the best way to find out is just to be obvious about it and don't be afraid to make a move. good luck!|`|oMTsDcNBaa	Sometimes.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	maybe, maybe not..it depends|`|caExWxHbaa	idk|`|zz4JkjbMaa	yes
yG2bsgXvaa	You go and see each other. Big deal if you've gained weight. Though, since you do have until March, how about you hit that treadmill pretty hard. Not only will the weight loss improve your health, it will dramatically improve your self-esteem.    Don't go into this thinking that a relationship will suddenly bloom had you not been in an accident. He wants to meet his friend. There is certainly a chance that the two of you may hook up, but don't worry yourself so much about it.|`|GHd84xipaa	if the guy is interested in you as a person,he will not care about your weight gain or the scare on your face.sounds like he he knows your inter beauty already.|`|L2pkns9maa	:( looks like means alot... But if hes a good guy... he will love you for the girl inside the fat.|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	If he is concerned about your looks he's not worth the time of day!  You sound like a sweet person a guy would be lucky to have.|`|5Z4yxxXQaa	very important if u dont got the looks u cant be with us|`|pM4YogW5aa	Yes, it's important.  The easiest way to avoid "rejection" is to not set any special expectation.  For all you know, he may not be interested in a relationship and may be seeking you because he trusts you as a friend.    If that's the case and you're expecting more, you may take it as personal rejection where he's just simply not available.    It doesn't hurt to look your best when you see him, just in case :)    Good Luck!|`|NvQMQv8Daa	Yo.  He saw you and wants to meet you?  Ofcourse the face, if you have alot of weight it shows alot.    Ofcourse he knows you are heavy. But, he still wants to meet? I think that YOU got the problem with yourself, and he likes you.    I think, go with it. You can't loose. If he says like he is not interested anymore, then you have made something wrong, because u already got him hooked.    Is there any possibility he does like you? HIM not YOU. Is there?    Really, is there a possibility he likes you eventhough you  talk trash about yourself and don't like yourself? Does he have the same tastes in women as you do? Does he read the fashion garbage magazines that many girls read?    IS THERE A POSSIBILITY HE LIKES YOU? A TINY ONE?    Yo, don't think for anybody else but yourself. Chillout, later.|`|UzGu9BD6aa	if he truly is ur friend his not going to care how u look give it a shot =]|`|yX5jLqDaaa	I'd be lying if I were to say that looks aren't somewhat important. I'm not saying you have to be the most gorgeous, but what I'm saying is that a guy must have the physical attraction to you. It seems to me like he is attracted to you so stop worrying. :)|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	guys can learn to see you in a different light than you see yourself, he already knows you, he knows about the scar, he knows about the weight, he obviously likes you for who you are, not what you look like, give him a chance|`|c1GimExEaa	go on a diet and start working out. you dont have to run you can use weights and things. but annyway go to a local gym and get a trainer they should be able to help you.|`|XVDZAiiVaa	you are friends with peopel because howthey are and act ,it is all personality , if he is a true friend he will not mind that you gained a few extra pounds.|`|KVlaTr9maa	heh.  60% of the day boys are thinking about girls.  5% girls think of boys.  LOL boys love looks, sorry to break it to you.  however, MEN love you for who you are.  and WOMEN accept that. go for it, girl. if he rejects you, HES A JERK! a boy. if not, now THAT is a man.|`|24mXv9Claa	rrrrr|`|opWc2OSeaa	very|`|s6A61VHTaa	rrrr|`|CD5BAt4Qaa	guys talk to you if you have looks but will stay for personality|`|VZkWlKKtaa	You should go for it and not be ashamed of yourself. Honestly looks are important to guys. But I think if he's the right guy it really won't matter and he'll be able to look past it and see who you are. If he's not the right guy then keep your head up there are a bunch more to pick from.|`|oj6x65s1aa	i think it depends on the maturity level of the guy.  guys who are immature tend to pick the anorexic looking girls with the huge chest and butt.  guys who are mature care about whats on  the inside.|`|5PuIgGi1aa	according how dark the room is and how drunk i am.|`|chFwkKzTaa	if hes a decent guy he won't care about your looks  but unfortunately most guys now days are superficial and only care about looks : /   if he doesn't like you too bad, there will be some guy that does :)    hope that helped :)|`|qPmPAhiwaa	depends on age of guy. 13 - 20 it will be 90%  21 - 30 its 65%  31 - 50 its less then 50%      as men develop and grow brains they see woman for more then just skin deep. At least most of us do.    If you are young though my best advice is to make sure you don't jump to the first guy to wave at you or you will get hurt.|`|KMT1v5mvaa	loooks arn't important sweetie! ok soo im 17 and i have a huge side to side scar on my stomac and everytime i go to the beach or pool i use to become so embarrised but if you have confedince which is soo hard to get because you might feel depressed than ill be ok!! im sure (if hes mature) he'll understand why you have the scar on your face to began with! and he wont judge you based upon that...because the face that you were such a sweetheart to him before...he'll probually be thankful that your still alive and kickin' thanks  to God!!! God allowed you to live and still function currectly, don't curse it, BLESSSS ITT! so if he allowed you to live, im sure hes going to allow somebody to fall in love with you...for you and only you..and the you deep down inside!     looks shouldn't makeup your personality! and i say you should go meet him...and as much as  it might hurt TRY AND BE CONFIDENT because chances are hes going to see past the scar and into your beauty! but if you act unconfident then hes going to know its  because of the scar! , but trust me...true beauty lies within'    i hope that helps  ?Cookie!
SIxMxu5gaa	No its not too old. If you managed to avoid the petty and shallow world of middle school dating, than that is an accomplishment worth being proud of. If you'd really like a boyfriend, perhaps it would be a good idea if you learned some flirting tips and about body language and stuff as most communication of the romantic variety is done non-verbally. And you are right, you are very pretty, and you dress with self respect and the guitar is a plus. I'm sure you are very charming and it is a cosmic mishap that you are not fighting off boys with a stick. Finding a significant other can be really difficult, especially if you are more mature or smarter than others your age. I was at 14, I didn't meet anyone worthwhile until I was 17. It seems people do like you as a person, which is an important step to getting someone interested in you romantically. What is most important though is that you be careful of liars (I'm a guy and one of my biggest problems was that some girls will flirt for attention and it can be very confusing until you learn how to weed them out) and find someone you like as a person and are attracted to and then pursue something with them. Unfortunately, that is the most I can say though as I know absolutely nothing about attracting early teenage boys. Good luck.|`|9qmcF0O0aa	idk, i dont see why you havent, your HOT!|`|0utZQuyeaa	Nope :D! I'm 14 as well, a freshman, as you are too, I'm assuming.  I have tons of friends my age who've never had a boyfriend.   *shrugs*  We'll just be patient and a wonderful guy will come along for each of us :]  There's no rush. We've still got PLENTY of time to have boyfriends. For now, I'm enjoying life with no complications from relationships, & you should too :D... Lovely.

NYqivyA2aa	he like you from the beginning but when he found out that you liked him he thought that you weren't him big challenge ,now he still likes you but he is jealous and doesn't know what 2 do except to ignore you.
WMNbGsoWaa	Wow, she's rude. I'd just ignore her. You can do whatever you want to do, you don't need a snobby friend telling you what you can and can't do.     Go ahead and play volleyball if you enjoy it. She just needs to learn how to respect her friends. Don't be intimidated by her.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	okay this is kind of immature. you didn't put your age but my guess is you are 13 or 14, because once you grow up, you should tell the difference between your friends and other people who claim to be your friends.  if i were you i would just dump her, get another set of friends, you don't need her. friends are supposed to be supportive and help each other out. so she's not really your friend.   respond to her e-mail "alright you can keep whatever you want but you can't keep my friendship, you choose"|`|afYSjcp0aa	you can say   "10000 other ppl around the world play volleyball it is not YOUR sport its also a team sport and ur starting to really annoy me with this MINE YOURS thing ever heard of sharing?"|`|771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Okay first of all your "best friend" is being quite selfish and really childish for communicating with you about how she feels about you playing volleyball through email in an irrational way. Best friends should be able to talk to each other about almost anything even when a conflict arises between them. If she was really your best friend she would support you playing volleyball even if she was already playing it unofficially or whatever, anyway in general she should support you in all the things you do and be there for you and the same the other way around.    Honestly to me it sounds like shes a little insecure and sees it as a competition between you guys of who does what first and who is better at it. Also I think that your "best friend" feels as though she has to always be the one to do something new and exciting first just so she can outshine you and that she may be an attention craver.     Regarding your situation I think that you should first tell her that she should stop communicating and adressing your guys' problems and conflicts through email and start coming to a resolution by talking to each other face to face and not through technology and be mature about it. Second, I think that you should stand up for yourself and tell her how you honestly feel about her saying you can't do certain things because shes already tooken up an interest in them because you're two different people who have separate lives and she can't tell you or advise you on what to do with yours at all, she may be your friend but shes not your mother. Also i think you should tell her how you don't appreciate the fact that she feels the need to take charge of your life and be controlling.     By standing up for yourself it will show her that you're serious and mean what you're telling her and it will also show her that you deserve the respect that you give her. When someone is trying to control someone elses life and is always being competitive in a friendship, it doesn't really last that long so if she doesn't understand how you feel than you should find someone else that will treat you with respect and like a real best friend would.    I hope this helps you.
JNoesCChaa	well for guys going to the washroom and making noises is a cool thing to do!!! at least a funny thing to do. and going to the washroom with your fiancee right there beside you is magical. To be able to take a dumb right beside the person you love shows the other person that you feel comfortable around no matter what you are doing. Also to tell them not to go in the washroom with you is sort of hiding something to men!!!! so better get used to the fact he can be with you in the washroom especially in the future when you might have to share one?|`|qAgF5R3Yaa	you guys are getting married soon so eventually it's going to be normal for you so get use to it.  as far as you, you will come around just give it some time then it won't matter
1tQef9edaa	I think what usually does it for me is,,well when I am not rushed. Be very sensitive and speak softly. Have all the time in the world for her.. Kiss up and down her neck slowly while you tell her how sexy she is and how much you love her. Let her take as long as she needs to get into the mood before going for the GOLD! I think just having all the time in the world to please her is BEST. It will relax her & then she can focus on what is going on. It all starts with the woman's mind & emotions & than you can get her to do pretty much anything if she is comfortable. This is what is best for me. (U gotta sweet talk her first).|`|Isl4B5rYaa	when you talk dirty. or just touch me in bad places when were just sitting on the couch. and when smack my ***. buttt thats for my girlfriend to do ;)
0qmqte7kaa	well with my bf we kinda play fight but when we do and i get mad i just pretend like im sad and go to my room and not talk to him and he comes in there all sweet and says he is sorry and gives me kisses and then he is so sweet the rest of the night/day whatever! And if he is mad at me then i just say im sorry and tell him that i wont do it again and then i am really sweet with him...but it really just depends on your relationship!|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Tell em' you just had sex with someone else.|`|isxDvwlraa	make it up to them.  do somethiing nice fer em' ;]  jeje u know what boys like|`|71RMmp2Kaa	get over it you saggy piece of ****!
9yFdxmHwaa	Do you know a line "opposites attract"? It's real.     The choice for each guy is different. A loud guy will like a shy girl because he'd think she's deep if she doesn't laugh hard to her jokes. "She's so cute when she smiles." Most of the time, he won't notice a lot of girls who are laughing on the same joke. He would fall for her just making her laugh.    Same with "Shy guy". "She is so full of life. Real joker. Real outdoor type." So on.    Shy girl - Be close to him. Be a tease, but don't overdo it. Let "him" work you.    Loud girl - Go to him. Bring the field and ask him to join. It may be difficult, but you'll succeed.     What is your type?|`|wZaWDgeMaa	well.. answer is simple.. Guys like Open girl, who talks what they want. you just ask yourself would u like shy guy to romance? who just wait for you to start al the time and doesnt tell u what he likes and dislikes?|`|Pl2nBnlVaa	Defienitly not loud  but not shy kind of a happy meduim because they don't like it when they r over powerd by girls but they don't like it when girls say nothing at all they like a convo|`|mOZfR8yhaa	LOUD IF YOUR SHY THEY WILL BE AFRAID TO MAKE A MOVE!!!!!|`|y2X1j7cAaa	srry not a guy|`|18ZACuQZaa	I feel in love with my wife because she didn't try to be someone that she isn't. My wife is shy sometimes and sometimes she's outspoken. I love everything about her. Just be yourself!|`|3KVBBUgTaa	shy girls that make subtle but yet noticeable moves
p11VaUGWaa	!5 year olds aren't yet emotionally mature enough to know what love really is. It may feel like love to you and him, but most likely it's infatuation. Trust me, I thought I was in love with a boy at your age and when the relationship ended I realized it wasn't love... just a whole lot of hormones. But it's sweet that you really care about him. If it makes you uncomfortable when he says he's in love with you, tell him that the relationship is getting too serious for you.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Your bf's definition of love might be different than yours.  He probably feels the same way about you as you do about him and he thinks that's 'love' where you think it's cathection.     You don't have to say it back just because he says it to you.  But you don't want him to feel uncomfortable saying it to you if he really feels that way.    When he says it, just be cute about it and say something like "How can you possibly love me when I have such ugly feet?"  Make it light and have fun.  It's not a bad thing he loves you.  You'll say it to him when the time is right.|`|Molu004zaa	You know what really grinds my gears? When someone says they're 'too young' to be in love. Wtf? :/ Someone ELSE might say you're too young to be in love, but you can hardly say that about YOURSELF. That just downright doesn't make sense :/ If you're not in love with your boyfriend, do him a favour and leave him so he can find another girl.|`|dJkNofnoaa	you have to tell him howyou feel. dont play him|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	idk. i found love at 15. me and that girl were together for a lil over 2 years. we just broke up. but you will never know what true love is til you find it so if u feel it its probably love|`|oCaM2K2Caa	Well, in my oppinion you are not to young to know what true love is. You may not always LIKE him but you know you always LOVE him. I think that if you are determined to not say you're in love with him you NEED to explain it to him.   Trust me, if he feels like you dont love him and you start backing off..you're ARE going to lose him.  Take my advice, It has happened to me before. Just be really open about it and if he really is "in love" with you that much like he says he is, he will understand.  Hope everything works out    ~nickie
1HsKQovDaa	im here to help.   well if you really like this guy, and your too scared it never hurts just to text him. lol.   or next time you hug him you should look him in the eyes and smile, and just walk away. trust me it works. because then he will think "wow what was that all about" =)|`|Sglf8NIgaa	well maybe he is not interested, but be brave and just ask him if he is interested in a relationship, at least you will know and not waste the rest of your life wondering.
BPlJCC7xaa	Wow sounds kind of like a jerk to me. He shouldn't say "i know" if something hurt you.. that's mean. I personally think he likes your boobs. Sorry! I'm sure you can find a much better guy, he's not worth you... good luck!|`|7EheyuEwaa	jeez , is he 12?!|`|zwaXYoRbaa	He just likes your boobs.|`|1cb54c58149197f99ecad855b6812d00aa	He just wanted to show you how strong he was.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	lol. What a dick. He doesnt "know". Some guys will definetely treat you differently because of your breast size... enjoy the attention.|`|7a5f3bb20260079dc883059f6e3fc617aa	that means he is a freaky boy ;; but if thats what u like hey! go for it. lol but you need to go on more than a hug to find out if he really likes you or not.
5MxKdoixaa	He has confused you being his support system with loving you. It happens. A lot.
aIEkNM0Paa	yeah sure as long as you know that this girl doesnt like you..|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	ask her yourself, why have another classmate do it.|`|2TlN47Ihaa	It could be weird if you don't know her THAT well.|`|3CWaHiR1aa	nope|`|odQewFgvaa	If you want to get introduced to that girl.. that is a way to do it.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Why don't you introduce yourself to her? If she's worth anything she'll appreciate that you have the sack to make your own moves.

People need to learn!!!|`|DKRbAgcFaa	I know how you feel Ive been married for 10 years and my husband and I have had two brothers a cousin and a nephew of his live with us at one point or another.The thing is about loans when you release the money you should never think of it again because if you do your holding yourself and the other person slaves to that transaction if it comes back great then you build a stronger relationship with that person but,if it doesn't try not to think of it.It will only bring heart ache and contempt.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	My family, yes. My friends, no. I hand pick my own friends. I just don't let anyone be my friend.    At my school, I'll order pizza and a bunch of kids, who I don't like and never talked to, beg and cry for a slice. Even if they ask to pay for a slice, it's still annoying. My school won't let anyone have pizza ordered. But my mom brings it in for me for lunch. So that's why everyone gets pissed at me in school hahaha.|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	my sister is like that sometimes but my friend is COMPLETELY like that!  its fricken crazy how much she is freeloader.  lol she a total bargin hunter also. haha|`|YcgEmrRkaa	Yes we do|`|RL3EVSW2aa	just about my whole family even me
Bdo2GNA2aa	.......|......  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)    1. For women, we preen or groom ourselves subconsciously when we are attracted to someone  by smoothing down our hair or clothes, checking our lipstick, or straightening a tie. Combine your grooming gesture with a smile and a gaze. You can also toss your hair to one side  a combination 1-2 punch of preening and a flash of neck.    2. A genuine, friendly smile is you're most powerful. Behavior experts agree that a smile makes you more attractive and approachable. Guys, if a woman lock eyes and smiles with you three or more times in an evening, you have been given an unmistakably clear signal that she's interested. Make your move, if you don't, somebody else will.    3. Gaze the eyes with the person you're flirting with for a full five to six seconds, smile and then drop your fix. Do this at least three times in a ten to fifteen-minute period. Your target needs to know you are flirting with him; making eye contact is a universal signal of openness.    4. One of the more successful flirting techniques a woman can employ is to expose her neck. A head tilt, the classic hair flip, or the over-the-shoulder glance attracts men's attention, exposes your neck, and gives you the opportunity to lock eyes. The over-the-shoulder move is extra-effective because it's sexy and sends a signal to your target that they are worth a second look.    5. Members of both sexes are subconsciously attracted to red, moist lips because they signal youth, sex and fertility. Red also increases a man's heart rate. How to capitalize on it? Wearing a red lipstick gives women's lips not only a youthful color but also a more obvious smile and whiter teeth. Using a super-shiny lip gloss makes your lips look moist and kissable. Men or women should lick their lips subtly (you don't want to look like you're trying out for a porno flick) or bite the lower lip both are extremely effective flirting behaviors.      6. Men should stand tall with the shoulders pulled back and squared; women are biologically attracted to more dominant men. Feel free to take up some space.    7. For women, crossing and uncrossing their legs is a surefire flirting technique, especially if you're wearing high heels. A woman crossing her legs appears seductive to men and it makes them desire to see more. Slipping the heel out of your shoe and dangling it on your toes is another trick. The arch of a foot sends a sexual message and mimics a woman's curves, and makes a man's heart race.    8. Once you and your flirting target start talking, the next step is to intensify the attraction. How? Smile and maintain eye contact, focus all of your attention on what they say. No one is more attractive than someone who gives you an undivided attention. Employ the nod and head tilt techniques. Smiling and laughing are crucial at this point  it the quickly puts the other person at ease. Making low-level contact by brushing the shoulder or elbow is another effective flirting technique.    9. People mirror each other's body language  gestures, voice volume, posture, etc when they are attracted. Very subtly mirror your flirting target's behavior  if she leans forward, lean forward; if he scratches his head, scratch your head. When you mirror someone's behavior, they'll begin to feel, think and believe as though the two of you are connected.|`|C5ducEu9aa	It's spelled "my", not "mi".|`|hjjmcbbPaa	i like the tell him straight approach
X6HUimEFaa	I am getting a vibe of a  Stalker Status|`|cG7z70Vgaa	I think she either doesn't know you and is creeped out or she really likes you. She is shy. Take it slow if you like her back.|`|QgKAL3sEaa	She waaants yoooouuuu    but she's shy... play nice! ;)|`|9cSDuplAaa	shes a fuK!n vampire|`|VFzrbbBMaa	shes just really shy...keep talking to her and she will eventually become more comfortable with you i think
PCb44JoWaa	Tell him you are together anymore. DOnt have someone else ask if he has feelings for you. THat makes you look pathetic.
oVXNsu54aa	this happened to me to so i just told my guy friend(who i liked) and told him how i felt deep down in side. It turned out he felt the same way about me and now we have been dating for 4 years. I couldnt be any happier. I hope everything works out 4 you 2.    Hope this helped.
pd1ywXmKaa	unless she was really fashion/brand conscious i don't think any girl would notice what brand of jeans you're wearing. mostly when i check out guys i admire their good looks. if i'm staring its cause i think you're hot
20f48fd2f5814755e839599a99c717b3aa	Cocktails and finger foods is the only way to go. Inviting people to the ceremony and not the reception? In bad taste. You can write in the invites that it's a cocktail reception, so people know not to expect a full meal. Booze is where you will spend a large chunk of change. To save costs there...have a white wine, red wine, a couple of beers to choose from and a "signature" drink. One cocktail that fits the overall theme or even season of your wedding. Married in summertime? A raspberry-vodka lemonade beverage would be great. Fall wedding? A cranberry vodka spritzer (cranberry juice, vodka and tonic) would be perfect. For apps...have a large veggie table, maybe a cheese table with crackers and breads and a few passed goodies.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think if someone is invited to the ceremony they should be invited to the reception.  If you are worried about the cost, perhaps do a cash bar (which I know ppl find rude as well but if it came down to a cash bar or them not being at the reception at all, I think most would take the cash bar), or a buffet style dinner.|`|crxbob5jaa	It can cause hurt feelings and people to think you are very rude. To avoid that, you probably need to come up with a plan for a smaller guest list --or-- a more manageable reception.     Afternoon receptions are a fraction of the cost of an evening reception.   Dessert receptions are popular and can help cut costs. Especially if the wedding/reception are scheduled when it's not mealtime.|`|7893c8accf8af1d924e5c9e1796b3a66aa	I think a nice touching thing that you can give them as a keepsake for the reception so they all fell part of the whole thing are photo cookies, or personalized cookies.  You could write something unique to them that shows  you care.  I'm using the fortune cookies for my wedding.  I found them at Fortune Wedding Favors.  Mine's only costing me about .99 cents a piece.|`|Y08YLysXaa	Do you really need that many people at the ceremony? I think it's a bit rude to invite someone to the ceremony and not the reception. Maybe have a cocktail wedding with just drinks and finger food so you don't have to buy 200 meals?|`|YfxydPF5aa	It's impolite to invite people to the ceremony and not the reception. If I was invited to just the ceremony I would feel like they didn't care about me enough to spend their money on me so I wouldn't feel like I should care enough to go.    To cut reception costs have a brunch or cake and punch.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	It's impolite to invite people to the ceremony but only a select few to the reception.  Honestly, if i was just invited to the ceremony, I would not go.  I don't know anyone that gets everyone to attend the ceremony.  Most people view the reception as the "wedding" as that is the celebration (i.e. fun part).|`|76nTvO4iaa	It is a violation of etiquette to invite people to the ceremony and not the reception.    Have a 200 person ceremony at 2 p.m. and then a punch and cake reception.  That should cut your expenses.|`|zmqN0M86aa	I would be offended if I was one of those people who weren't invited to the reception, as most people would.  It's not polite to invite people to the wedding, but not the reception and vice versa.  If you're trying to save money, cut the guest list.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Not acceptable. Everyone invited to the ceremony needs to be invited to the reception and vice versa. If you can't afford dinner for that many people, have the reception at a non-meal time and serve cake and coffee.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Nope. Only the same people invited to both the ceremony and reception.    *darned that word and its spelling.... I just use 'appies' (appetizers).|`|FVFxE6owaa	It's inappropriate and rude to invite people to the ceremony but not to the reception.  If you cannot afford to feed all 200 guests, then you need to scale down the guest list.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Dont invite people to your wedding if you don't want to host them at the celebratory party. It's fine to ask people to the reception and not the wedding - some churches are smaller than the guest list allows - but hateful the other way around.  The only exception is that church members can attend any religious celebration (including the Sacrament of Marriage) at their church without being invited to the reception.|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Personally, I think it would be a little rude, but you can mitigate around that a bit. You can have a dessert bar/stand with several of dessert options. You can also yes have a tapas/ hor'dovers bar. By changing your wedding and reception time you can have a reception during a time people are not expecting a meal. Or you can have a classy BBQ.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	It's in immense bad taste to invite people to the ceremony and not to the reception. This is one of the inviolable rules of wedding etiquette.    The reception is meant to thank your guests for their well-wishes and moral support and in addition to thank them for coming to the ceremony. Therefore every person invited to the ceremony must be invited to the reception. Doing otherwise will make people think you invited them only to get a gift from them, and will be seen as rude, greedy, and selfish (even if you don't mean it to be).    You can have an hors d'oeuvres or cake-and-punch reception, but only if the ceremony and reception do not overlap a meal period. Schedule the ceremony and reception to fall in between 1:15 and 5 PM or to begin after 7:15 PM. If you have a reception during a meal period, you must offer them a meal.    If you really need to save money, you can have a small ceremony and a small reception.|`|DqetlSB6aa	If you wanna save money- cut your list to 100. Invite only close family and friends....don't invite the people you work with but don't really like or friends of your parents friend.  If you haven talked to them in a year, cut them from the list.    Its hard to have people at the wedding then tell them they cant attend the reception.  Im not sure how you would even pull that off.
lRemKlvOaa	i know how you feel but trust me you have a better chance of her saying yes if you get to know her first|`|9w8EW24daa	no it is too soon get to no her better|`|2NtiI51aaa	no.. give her the chance to get to know you more  cause you may like her.. but she doesnt know a whole about you im guessing so it probably wouldnt be the wisest choice|`|JwIaAJ69aa	I wouldn't.  I would try to get to know her better and then just ask her if she would like to do something sometime or say you are going somewhere and ask if she would like to come along.|`|eXYldVRUaa	Get to know her better first :)
pzLDXL6gaa	I guess you just have to try and isolate yourself from her. Don't be very enthusiastic when she tries to talk to you. Ignore her when she says mean things. Do you know anybody else on the class or buss you can talk to? Can you change any classes, move seats? If not, can you wait it out until you can?    Harriet|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	shes probably just trying to get attention.  talk to her, tell her how you feel.  and if she doesnt stop than just stop trying.|`|TlA1SmrLaa	punch her in the face one time|`|scyvsf7Eaa	Pretend she doesnt exist. but make sure you don't look sad, or unhappy. act like your just fine. If she won't leave you alone, give her a look that says 'Umm, kay then..' and act like she's weird..    It sounds to me like she's trying to dominate over you. When people do that, they do it because they feel like they need to. Don't tell her off, dont even give her the satisfaction of a second glance. talk to other people..    i dont mean to interfere, but this is just my advice. do not become her friend again. she will do the same thing over and over again.. i've been through all this, and erg it just gets tiring.|`|jsTIah9oaa	First off anyone that treats you like that is NOT your friend! She can talk all she wants about you but don't let her get the best of you. Yes, you ride the bus with her and take all your classes but that doesn't mean you have to seat there and be her bff! Say hi and leave it at that, let her do all the talking. Take it from my experience and be careful what you tell girls like her. Don't trust her on anything and go find new friends because little girls like that will bring you down!    Just be tough. Don't let people like that bring you down, and always be yourself!|`|YCLqFB5Oaa	I think.  she isn't your friend anymore.  don't worry.  If she likes boys so much, in highschool she will be known as "the whore".
naequcqlaa	She was probably just glad to see him.  Haven't you ever seen someone & you automatically gave them a hug because you just were glad to see them?  I know I have tons of times.  I wouldn't even give it a second tho't.  Lots of folks are just friendly in that manner & I sure wouldn't give it a second tho't.  Easy does it...:)|`|6GFw9gkraa	calm down dear... its only a hug!|`|TIlxoclXaa	She could have just been very touchy feely. I know people, distantly and not very well at all, who will randomly hug me when they see me. I doubt anything was really up between your boyfriend and his lab partner...just sounds like she us a touchy feely person...she probably hugs everyone she sees.
N8TIPTDfaa	I don't see the problem there.   She didn't lie to you.     She told you she's still a virgin, which is what you believe it right as well.     Also, she admitted she masturbates..  that's just how she does it.    She IS being responsible...she's replacing a penis with other objects..    That's GOOD! Since you believe in abstinance.  98 percent of people masturbate.      As long as she has not had sex, she has done nothing wrong to you,  and i honestly feel that you are overreacting.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Your an idiot. Bend her over, and give it to her.|`|ITPSa0d6aa	Masturbation isnt that bad.  Millions of people do it one or more times every week.  And if she didn't wanna tell you, then don't hold it against her.|`|fMpKj0DYaa	Dude. its her vagina. And it shouldnt matter to you what she has done with her vagina because its hers. So what if she has masturbated. Big deal. So what if she has had 3 ultra sounds, not all of us are blessed with great health. If you love her then it wont matter whats been in her vagina even if it was another guys dick.     I'm pretty sure that God says not to judge others. So maybe you should fear God in all aspects and not just one.|`|08tdupUSaa	you don't have to masturbate for a finger to fit.  i've never had sex and i could if i wanted.  okay so masturbating IS wrong in gods eyes but she's still a virgin.  and technically your still kind of having sex.  god doesn't want you near her vagina if your a christian unless your married.    vaginas aren't cemented shut until you lose your virginity hon.  they're always open.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	she was just curious as we all are. it is human for anyone to masterbate. just because she masterbated doesn't mean she isn't a virgin. yor finger going in easy means nothing. fingers are not that big and can slip in easy. if she did have a vaginal ultrasound then it makse sense. those things are pretty big but to my knowledge they don't usually give them to virgins vaginally but some do. but it's her body she can do what she wants. atleast she told you and it doesn't mean she isn't a virgin. justt talk it over with her and tell her this. she may feel really bad for doing it. but stop judging her. and technically you shouldn't be fingering her anyways. god doesn't want that happening until marriage too. it's her body.|`|VMIkIv26aa	dump her. why should you have a relationship with someone you cant trust?
tmDklO54aa	get him some nice cologne, like polo by ralph lauren, or reaction by kenneth cole.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	im having the same problem. :/
4yhGXh8kaa	Lemme get this straight, you think he might break up with his girlfriend because he looks at you and you want to further entice him, however "im not some whore trying to steal him away or anything..." ....    Step 1: Lewd pic of yourself, give it to him to keep.  Step 2: His ex attempts to kill you  Step 3: Another cute girl gives him a better pic, with nudity  Step 4: You attempt to kill this other cute girl  Step 5: You get out of Juvy in time for graduation.    No but seriously, if he likes you, he likes you, just let him make up his mind.

irVywHMkaa	I think you are over-analyzing it but I could be totally wrong. just ask him if he wants to hang out after school or something and make it casual and then you can pick up on his body language
DWeGV8Akaa	only if it was you ;)|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	are you a vampire ?|`|lzgRNQjfaa	Hmmm ..oh noooope|`|62T9Kozfaa	fosho !

No contact with the X, queen of the Vampires.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	TWILIGHT IS NOT REAL LIFE!    And no, I wouldn't because vampires prey on humans. This is like a hamburger asking a chicken breast if it'd kiss a human.    Furthermore, Baron Sengir, Blade, Alucard, Kain, Rayne and Vlad the Impaler were all twice the vampire Stephanie Meyer could ever even imagine writing of.|`|Bngsrgpgaa	As much as I love Emmett Cullen, no. I don't think I would... unless I was REALLY in the moment and didn't give a crap about my impending death :P|`|QTK3I2EAaa	shaddup.  your not gonna kiss edward cullen, get over it & please find a boyfriend.|`|wEdH4qfVaa	um?|`|4d5c4ad41e20b88fd01b606f0aafeb2caa	hellz yesh!!!   there ******* awsome!!!|`|vCsSOmVOaa	hell yes|`|Lj751YtAaa	nope, they don't exist.|`|r7tllHjuaa	moron! |`|c7f69b1a6447dc385e4a6eef027db5e6aa	No!

EDIT: get over yourselves, its perfectly okay for me to like a series... no life muchhhhh?
kUfiQkgdaa	Well something easy kick him lightly, look under the table, back at him, ask if he's okay, then say sorry, and aks how his day was going before you kicked him.|`|uogtJXPIaa	After a test or quiz you could pull the old "How do you think you did on that test/quiz?" i did that once, and we ended up talking for a while|`|AYdpkCRUaa	You should say  sup (then his name)  wat are you doing today?    How does this sound to u?|`|1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	say.. Hi, how are you?|`|Gc9E2jRSaa	pretend to bump into him. then say something random and then it starts. oh and after that, always say hi when you pass him|`|EVX17AjRaa	Just ask him what hes doing over the weekend or what he likes to do. Try to get to know him.|`|NAvaa1Araa	First to break the ice you should introduce yourself then ask him questions, get to know him and see how it goes. Good luck!|`|KJpFr9lKaa	just be likee heyy , im like best friends with you friend how come   we never talk ?! aha and just laugh  just be outgoing.. trust me, i know tons of people, and ive met all of them  because of how outgoing i am.  dont be shy, make him feel shy by being outgoing.. it really works  trust.|`|K4emL77jaa	how about a HI|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	well if hes a grade higher then you, you could tell him that you are having trouble understanding what your teacher is talking about in class.  Then as he explains start to make the convo shift so you can get to know him better.  Best of luck girllll!!!|`|nStTaNPwaa	You could ask if he is from japan and if he is ...which part, how long did he live there etc etc., or if he isn't japanese than you can ask him why are you taking japenese, is this for school etc.,?|`|4VDbwLJnaa	girl! honestly whats the number one convo starter?! hi!|`|507c5070ad881726f855f0538514580aaa	you want to know what I use...:  "hey sexy"   it always knocks them dead|`|MpG8n0vMaa	talk to him. ask him what he likes to do. wat he listens to. etc. then the rest will jus fall in place      good luck|`|Czpfs8RLaa	Ask him about his favorite stuff like say a movie if you have seen it you guys can talk about it if not ask him to tell you about it or if you arnt bad at flirting ask him if you could rent it with him so he can make sure you watch it *wink but talk about interests it always works for me :)|`|OqAOCBnFaa	When you see him around his friends, start talking to them. Then notice him, like just a glance and smile and say "Hey, your in my class aren't you?" Like you don't know. Then it starts a conversation.|`|WJHriZWjaa	Get to know his friends better, and walk over to say "hi" when they're around him. That way, they'll have to include you in their conversation out of courtesy, and you can get to know him better based on what he says. Perfect solution!|`|jLkbnLWfaa	compliment him on somthin, is your skool in Mcclain? I used to go to japanese skool there, it was so boring...good luck.|`|tsYtZFHjaa	Hi!|`|jeILXlvdaa	yesh|`|wg9e91Juaa	i went to a polish school on saturdays :D  i can relate  just be like so what is your normal school like|`|aOfq8Pgeaa	mutual friends is a good starter, have your friend who is also his friend introduce ya!|`|ubsDtXxnaa	His intrests, never shoes, cloting, or fashion. SPORTS IS GOOD!|`|My7SgLfoaa	Well since he is asian, ask him to help with math.|`|oeW1WDXfaa	lier|`|nmAjAH73aa	Say Hi and talk about anything maybe how you like or dislike the class or the weather.|`|4suXhe6iaa	Yeah!  it sounds you do, since u a bit shy!|`|vzDmaWqaaa	ask where his favorite place to eat is and maybe your mutual friend and the two of you can go check it out together so you can learn a little more about him.|`|WXdMHMfwaa	You should ask his friend to drop hints for you, and to see what his reaction is.  Also dont be shy, it only hinders your chances.    A good conversation starter? What about, Hi my name is x...whats yours? Would you like to study together, or compare notes/homework together?    Get creative!|`|S6iJSXseaa	just go up to him and say hey, just be friendly and stuff.    adn ask his Friend for his number and text him sometime and just act friendly and nice and say hey ever once and while!|`|LaPFzZbKaa	hi! is this a chatting program?|`|OMs2EuTuaa	Hi, good to see you again.  Hey I like your jacket/bag/shoes etc|`|u0kUl1T1aa	maybe try talking to his very good friend?|`|weckW02caa	just go up to him and say hi. the conversation will take off from there ask him what he likes to do. introduce yourself girl.|`|67tQqGnoaa	well get his number and ask him how is day was or find something that u guys have in comin and start a conversation that way it gets easier the more u do it. :)|`|apxKzwyzaa	Get his number from your friend and then either call him or have your friend introduce him to you. That would break the ice. Also ask your friend what he likes and that way you can figure out what you have in common and get talking about something.    Hope this is helpful!    Good Luck ;]|`|X3YtZ9Fsaa	Your a girl, just show some cleevage and talk about whatever|`|EYW6av1Uaa	Just say hey and ask him something like what he likes to do in his free time and then if he tells you and you guys have any of the same interests mention doing this activity together some other time.|`|AOX29WOYaa	Find out what hes interested in from your friends, or what he likes to do. Or just start talking to him about his classes or see if you have any of the same teachers|`|Xr4taSb4aa	u could ask: i need help with  something in grammar or a meaning from japanese to english ......|`|d49ZA5xYaa	just ask him something about himself. like what school he goes to|`|mXaYRe9Oaa	hi how are u... good. what do u think of the new president of the United States|`|8NbbrVwyaa	Maybe get a group of friends to go out one day. Ask his friend to come and bring the boy you like along. That way you would be with him for the day and you would have a reasonable enough excuse to talk to him. Good luck.|`|QmGptqkHaa	It's good that you had a good conversation with him the first time. It means that you two connected very well. Some things you can talk about are what are his hobbies, interests, what he likes in a girl... talk about his family... what are his goals and achievements... make him realize that you are interested in him and listen to everything he says.|`|6YWlqDkYaa	say, you look familiar, or say nice things about him to his friend-hopes that help.|`|eu6tT7tkaa	ask his friend what he is into and talk to him about that stuff|`|YVUZDb57aa	i lost my number, can i have yours?    Is there a mirror in your pants? cause i can see myself in them.    nice pants, they'd look good next to my bed.    you must be jamaican, cause you ja- makin me crazy.    or maybe just ask him how schools goin, what kinda music he like, just innocent small talk to familiarize your self until you can get into some deep conversation.|`|42h5GLncaa	first of all   QUIT BEING SUCH A STALKER  we all know you follow him around that school and collect his gum wrappers and ****  and if you cant get over the obsessionh tell him your up   for a one night stand cuz thats probably all he wants from you  and by the time your done reading this your going to probably wish you were a ******* dyke|`|BPDwrpmTaa	i know this sounds weird, and i don't mean stalk him but watch some of the things he does or try and figure out something hes interested in. this works cuz if you start with a COMMON interest (its better if you like it too) than you can build into a convo.    another good thing to do is say something funny to a friend when your next to him. sometimes guys will react.    or this is my fav. when he makes a comment like, "this is so cool" or a little more detailed like, "there are only 3 colors on the french flag" (by the way these are just tacky examples) you can start a cute pointless argument, but you always want to end it in "go home and google it" or "find a way to prove it and tell me tomorrow" that way you automatically have something to talk about next time you see him.    p.s. these all have worked for me. and NEVER start by talking about the weather.|`|W0aIIIoJaa	just start one like you would with his friend|`|9QiaWiXgaa	you could say... "hey i've heard many good things about you." ......|`|CLB32006aa	hey, what's up my name is blank I don't think Ive met you before. If he's good friends with your friend an introduction between you two should be really easy and natural. If they are both friends then the next time your with your friend and the kid you like goes to talk to him too just introduce yourself like that.    Hope this helps  Good luck :)|`|2wpPrmibaa	yeah you like her|`|2esGKO2Caa	Helloooooooooooooo|`|fe1d07deddd798cef8cc34a48d842115aa	Ask him if he's good in math because you don't understand this one problem. If he isn't, ask him if he'll help anyway because maybe you just need to talk it out with someone.|`|quM6eMT6aa	tell his friend whats going on and ave a conversation you 3 than as you get to know him it should get easier to have solo convos hope this helped.|`|u9CFPBkWaa	Ok, heres what is always a good one for me.  When I'm starting a conversation with a girl!!!    Ok first off the guy is in your lunch right? Sit next to him or depending on your lunch tables sit infront of him. Then casually say hey (his name here) whats up? hes gonna say something....  O yea? bla bla bla...    Ask him if he is in any sports, band, after school activities, ect...  Act like you might if you were just talking to any other person!   Ask him what kinda books he likes, movies he likes, games he likes to play. Whatever.     Good luck!!!|`|XoYHF1RLaa	Ask him out. I will be easier for him.|`|L4RAKdbSaa	u can ask him about a friend you know that sort of looks like him(even if you lie) ;), and then school and go on from theree i do it all the time|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	Ask soomeone for his  , call him and tell him that you like him|`|uhxtlZGJaa	well as a guy I would say to start talking about relationships      youtube.com/cyclops23666|`|v202XHZNaa	If you know his friend fairly well, you should approach him while he's with your crush. If that isn't an option, simply go up to your crush and ask him any kind of question that has to deal with the class your in, or even mention that you are friends with his friend, and that you would like to introduce yourself.  If you seem confident during the approach, he will be a lot more likely to ease up and things should go very smoothly!  Simple questions like, "How are you?" etc, can lead to natural conversation easily!  Good luck!|`|tI0rkxeuaa	"Hi my name's Shelly, it's nice to meet you."    The simple approach is often the best.  Don't try to be witty or clever, just makes you look desperate.
YPZICzNjaa	Advice: try lifting heavy objects     :-)    No, that wont earn 10 points lol, so anyway I'm feeling kinda of down from your message :-( but anyway, guys flirt with all pretty girls which is extremely normal for that type of age unfortuantly.  There is actually only a couple of solutions.  The best choice would be to wait and let it eat your heart out, stay close with him, but not too close unless he gives up his current gf.  The other way is to just express your feelings to him somewhere private where he can weigh it between your or his current gf to see who he likes more    gl.    -deatgh
mAN2xsHaaa	tell sum1 to kick his @$$|`|3PvrMTNuaa	Avoid him in general. Tell him enough is enough and you do NOT like him the slightest bit.|`|xkfkgCIPaa	Um wow. That is quite awkward. You should just ignore him and if that doesn't work ask a friend to keep him away from you.
QmGptqkHaa	I can understand why he would be shy. Maybe he has low self-esteem or he's scared to experiment things. Try kissing on the cheek first. Kiss his hand, rub faces.. I mean 3 months is quite a long time. Look into his eyes one night and just keep staring with a smile on your face and see what happens. If this lags on any longer, get yourself a man. But not a man that would take advantage of you.|`|zGi9Wag3aa	He's gay.|`|JTqHroAoaa	DO NOT say that you love him, let him be the one to tell you that first, trust me. but about the kissing, one time when you guys are about to leave eachother, give him a kiss on the lips. believe me, he'll think about what you just did and will want more, trust :)|`|8R71GBB1aa	I'm 17, and my boyfriend and I didn't kiss until we were dating for five months - when you take it slow, it really can turn out beautifully and he will respect you, which is a key thing.  I'm glad we waited for a while - we had true feelings for each other and it made the kiss even more special and meaningful.  He was also my first kiss.  I think kissing is one of the most intimate things a couple can do.  Don't worry - if it's really meant to be, it will happen naturally.  Good luck!|`|msr6s66gaa	wow thas a long time.. hmm. i wouldnt suggest doing it at school. i think you should do it outside of school like at your house his house of the movies or something|`|65FipYz7aa	hes shy my ex was da same way
RoTLnFGZaa	make him some cookies & get him a tshirt or something like that.  make a really sweet card, & he'll appreciate the gesture.  guys love food, too. that's a given.    it's more about him doing for you;; Its your special day.    GoodLuck.
EmWbvWEQaa	no your pretty but you look kinda ugly when your all sad like that. SMILE! you'd be gorgeous if you did. and im not just saying that. you would be. love your hair btw        xx|`|jeHTjvbaaa	No your not ugly, it would definitely help if you smiled though, you sorta look like a ***** with what facial expression lol.  Also, nice freckles, I love em =P|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	No, you're not ugly.  Try not to look so sad though.|`|uXWvDjWHaa	You need to smile. The look you're giving isn't too flattering. But, with that being said, you are Cute.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	My Brother said Hell Yeah.  There's your answer.|`|XQZEa7oOaa	very very very very very cute|`|GuOJIftAaa	Not at all! You have very nice eyes and I love your freckles =]|`|rKsgGHKkaa	no ur not ugly.|`|M0ww0NCFaa	Your gorgeous...but if you smiled you'll look even prettier!|`|7N2YPjkEaa	awwweeeeessss u have really cute freckles!!! but you might want to like open your eyes wider, like look more alert and put on a cute little side smile... :] oh and u have pretty lips|`|6L8AFxwdaa	well you're not ugly. you just need to smile and make your eyes opened more. then you'll be really pretty :D|`|EibGIpaKaa	First of all, you are NOT ugly in ANY way.  Your eyes are just a gorgeous brown. Do you realize how much people pay to inject their lips so they can have great full ones like yours?    Your hair is long and a gorgeous colour with nice waves.    I am thinking it's your freckles that you don't like? Do the kids tease you at school? If so, tell them to buzz off. Believe me, they look great on you. Freckles are NOT ugly, no matter what anyone says. Just remember, if you don't like them, they fade as you get older.    All I can truly recommend is that you be happy with yourself, and I think you are a beautiful young woman. Honest!
tg2jyApnaa	If want him to come on to you text: Flirt, puns, get to know him, hint that he should ask you out or so, joke around him writing romantic songs for you on the guitar???  (it all depends on the guy, i like more confident girls for example, he might too or might not).
jnEgsAHNaa	That's not intimidating at all, I find it really attractive that a girl is smart, can draw, and is active.  You aren't hurting anyone, just keep doing your thing :)|`|18ZACuQZaa	Don't be in a hurry to fall in love. You sound like a normal person with normal ambitions and desires. Confidence is a great quality, but humility is even better.|`|Jl5sQQjDaa	Don't think too much into it.  Don't try to isolate what guys may or may not like about you.  Just be you and keep enjoying life. Do what makes you happy.  You are extremely talented and one day you will make a lucky guy very very happy.  Keep drawing and playing music.  Artistic people are so attractive.|`|xEJm0NCiaa	aaaaggghhhh *run away* joking, lmao, not at all. i h8 drawing, ggrr.|`|HsWFqn1naa	if guys wont approach you, appoach them instead  guys can be shy too :P|`|hvZb0r3zaa	You don't sound intimidating at all. Your art is really good. You sound cute and your apparently smart. I have no clue why guys aren't approaching you.
NiWI9y7iaa	Go to churches. a pretty social place to hang out. ???
t0uIgY08aa	its about personality, and girls really don't like the jerks.. and thats kinda how your portraying yourself..|`|r18PoGJiaa	sounds like you are a shallow one|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	i judge someone on their personallity.  not how much they make or how they look.|`|gYzEvFb1aa	Well aside what everyone thinks, some girls aren't shallow. Its whats on the inside that counts. If the guy makes the girl feel a way she likes feeling then she'll stick to him. Its about who you are and how you make her feel when she's with you.|`|7869ca079f899653fde9ba75c3cc3134aa	nope, its safety. Some women feel safer more secure. A guy like that getting a babe like that, what r the odds? The guy will do what he can to make her as happy as she's made him by choosing to be w/ him. What would be the chances of being cheated on, hurt etc. They will worship the ground they walk on. No worries of getting hurt. More chances for a man really loving her.
rkmr3FAQaa	yeah you should have broken up w/ him  he was a jerk  but maybe you should have called him and told him it was over  ask Micheal to the dance
yuwjQjKqaa	You can make a guy jealous!|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Probably won't care. I'm a guy and if I'm the biggest flirt in school, I wouldn't care what you did because I don't care about you.|`|PmRbUgMoaa	Jealousy is bad. End of story.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Don't it would make it worst.
W2pU2g9Eaa	If I had to choose from the pics it would be the first one. I love muscles. But his are freakishly large! But no I don't like the second one my guy has to have at least a 6 pack and some muscles!!!|`|nql213V6aa	well the second one.  too much muscle is just gross,|`|cKRFgEr9aa	LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|jJoZ1nvVaa	i like muscular sometimes and sometimes regular depends|`|ADDzZeEHaa	any guy who takes care of himself and likes activity is sexy. wheter he be natuarlly skinny or not.|`|zxT6GL0gaa	that muscular is gross...  so i guess the second one but i don't really like that one either..  eh
oFzCgCrfaa	Well when he asks you should stay relaxed take a silent deep breath and say yes, smile a little not too much dont force it and let him make the next move. The key is to stay relaxed guys dont really like spastic girls so remember stay calm and give short answers make sure you speak clearly and dont be shy      hope i helped
SsvwdhsPaa	first of all, the spelling thing cracked me up so i looked back and you didnt have any miss-spellings anyways. =] lol  i agree that its weird that guys have to make the first move but as a girl im pretty glad they do because as you said with girls, i am afraid to talk to guys. i will totally losen up around them if they even aknowledge me. like if he just makes a point to ask me a question or something, thats a step. dont worry so much about talking to girls because MOST of us are really nice and we would love to be friends with you, or for some maybe even more.|`|hR1ff6Roaa	one of my friends said "let them be the man"  just to show that ull do that for them  but girls make moves sometimes when guys dont know it  like bumping someones hand w/yours if you want to hold their hand  ... but just stuff like that|`|SHC0p1RQaa	the guy that said that is a dummass u suck, but no guys make the first move.thats the way it is.but i understand where u coming from but just try and brake out of that shyness and be you.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Co-Sign. I prefer being a guy, though. Being a girl would suck.|`|cdUCCHgaaa	lol. when i know a guy wants to make the move but he like cant cuz hes shy i find it adorable and make the move myself. AND THE HELL IT IS EASIER TO BE A GIRL! we're not so scary, remember that, and if you get shot down its okay cuz that makes her a *****. :)|`|GBr9YngTaa	I am old fashion so I like the guy making the first move. It was how it was in the past and I somewhat carry it on. But you're right we live in a generation where if women want equal rights as well they should contribute to making first steps. However, there are a lot that do and for some they're just as scared to do it as you are. What if they feel like the "average looking, extremely shy girl"?|`|6L8AFxwdaa	I'm a girl... but i think guys should make the first move because in the end (this is my personal view) the girl would look up to you and have more respect for you.  i mean hey! you're shy, yet you made the first move. that's pretty cute and attractive.  and i hate how jocks have that whole advantage, its pretty stupid if you ask me.|`|75bcffedeed2e98b419c4ef51d05351faa	Guys don't always make the first move.  Start with a smile... if it's returned then begin to test the water. Ask friends if the person you are interested in is available, and if so, start with small talk, even just a hello in passing. If she is interested she will go out of her way to seek you out too. Perhaps the best advice I could give you is to relax ... be yourself and it will all work out.  If a girl doesn't respond, move on - there are many others who will.  Generally girls that are into themselves go for the jocks, and you don't need them anyway.  Good luck.|`|GGfLLgkXaa	Girls are scared to go up to guys, most of the time.  They're afraid they'll be rejected.|`|f512X3itaa	because girls are just as scared to do it so unless you stop being a little girl and get out there you will end up a 40 year old virgin|`|R5eXmRo3aa	Going up and asking them out.    I am a shy guy when it comes to relationships, but just do it. What is the worst that could happen? You get rejected? There are so many fishes in the sea, and guys have to make the first move because, they are guys...|`|YmgDYfbvaa	i agree!!! i think if a girl likes you too then there is nothing wrong with them making the first move.   but sometimes they dont or wont. and you just have to do it yourself. theres no secret to it.|`|ej65ULT4aa	Nobody is perfect.You can solve dating problem from dating sites,such as
0vJg1v5Xaa	i know someone who has a foot fetish, and it's kinda creepy
AA10604300	this is odd ball stuff,      mum, dad, silly little dudes......      first find out what licence your folks have for having children,   and then revoke this licence,   cancel this licence,,,,,,oooops, sorry,   you don't gotta have a licence to have kiddies,,,      shucks.      But have no fear, for the Supreme Being,     ahem, that is the reference to God....      for the Supreme Being, would like you to know of his   free gift of eternal life, that Jesus the Lord offered, when he rose again from the dead.        Just ask the Lord Jesus this,  Lord Jesus, I know and beleive that you died for me and rose again, so that I can have eternal life,  please forgive me of my sins and save me.      then you must learn how to overcome the fear and the absolute dread of this life,  and perhaps God may help you to turn your fears into   strength,      but you gotta learn to read the Bible,   King James 1611 holy bible,,,,
e22c69d9c930e30e0d8bcfc48f81dd6faa	I'm gonna be honest, it sounds like you have a massive contradiction going on inside yourself.    You say you "love girls", "flirt with them all the time" and "can't get enough of beautiful women"....and yet when you get one, you run away after 2 weeks?!    2 weeks isn't enough to decide whether a relationship is working out or not. In fact, I wouldn't even consider a two week relationship a proper relationship.    It sounded first like you might have commitment issues - you really want girls, but don't want to settle down (and you find any lousy, ridiculous excuse to run away after two weeks). That would explain all the sexual energy you can't get rid of too.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Yes, stop focusing on girls and start focusing on a career.  Eventually you are going to want a wife, and the kind of woman you will want is not going to go for a man who is "looking and flirting" around all the time.  "BIG TURN OFF!"  So focus on your life and getting it where it needs to be.  Then along the way, you will meet someone that is attracted to the real "you" and not some goofball that can't stop looking at her chest or backside!  In other words...be the kind of man that the kind of woman you want, will be attracted to.
q3FDAQ9Baa	well, I don't think he should be going anywhere with her. Unless it's rushing off to the hospital cause of the kids.  If their marriage is over, then he shouldn't be spending time with HER  just his kids.  I hate counceling, but maybe there is a good one in your area, where the 2 of you can go together and let it all out about what is right and wrong for your relationship.  You do have to keep i mind that his kids will come FIRST.  BUT the EX??  NO way|`|bO2rzfISaa	Go to therapy. A lot of people DO NOT feel this way. I am totally friendly with my ex's gf and my husbnd's ex. I've never been jealous. Talk to someone until you feel better.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	You need to deal with the cheating...just because one person was a jerk doesn't mean they will all be.  I married a man with two kids and an ex.  They aren't close, but I have to tell you that you have to learn to let it go.  Just because they communicate, laugh, come to agreements over the kids, there is NO THREAT to your relationship.  If they were meant to be, they would still be together, right?|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	If you can't get over the "ex" factor, then move on.    She will be a part of your life, FOREVER.  You need to learn to deal with your jealousy (perhaps some counseling), or cut your losses and find a man without any baggage.|`|aMlxa7Ksaa	It sounds to me like you are not ready to get married.  You have some issues to overcome and better to deal with them BEFORE the marriage than after.  Put the wedding date off until you can deal with your feelings.
pzLDXL6gaa	It depends, yeah you can miss out but also it can be beneficial. I think getting engaged is silly though.    Harriet|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Best way to put it is Love can come at any age, just capitalize on it when it happens, whether ur 17 18 or 50 lol, do what makes you happy..just make sure its love not infatuation your feeling!|`|4OxDLaJLaa	if you love them, truly love them you wont   be settling down, you'll just be starting,  its never a bad thing.  I've been dating my boyfriends since October,  we were friends before that but we will be getting   engaged on christmas, im 17 he'll be 21.  so whatever you prefer.  love is love, dont stop it.
oaF2kaXAaa	You need to be VERY blunt. He sounds like an ***. I wouldnt stay with that type of guy anyway... there are so many other guys out there that would respect and listen to you with you only having to say it once. What a loser. Get rid of him.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Be honest about what you want, then he can choose to be with you or find someone else.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	communicate 1st!   explain to him you not ready and fele you want more from your wonderful relationship than just sex! explain that you realise sex is an integral factor of a wonderful relationship like yours but that you want in your wonderful relationship everything else tat makes it wonderful! like the comunication, likenesses, togetherness, respect, faith and faithfulness, loyalty, etc.  explain that you want to explore him and want him to explore you so that your relationship has the best foundation! and that with this comes the best love (sex) life he will have everheard of! his mates will envy him the Fantastic relationship and life he has wit his significant oher!  if he doesnt understand this and its how you want it then lovey yo may have to be singleagain til you can find someone who you know you can be true to yourself and them with..  hope this helps.. :)|`|EnkSP0Vtaa	Sorry, but if all he wants is the physical and you don't want that then you need to break up with him, he doesn't deserve you.|`|ca83b6571e1307938cec4c3f9a53806aaa	you need to talk to him and make him understand that thats not what you want.  You might need to threaten him that you can't have a relationship thats just physical and it has to change or your not gonna work out|`|YEjhx5Mvaa	ignore him for a while then start talking to him again and if he still wants to then you wont have any other choice but to break up with him unless you want him to keep asking you|`|lZO1BBmYaa	I see where you are coming from on this because the same thing happened to me with this guy that Ive been with for some time now......  I say try talking to him about how you feel and just that you are not ready to make that connection with him.......and please do not just dump him because what he might have to say to you may make all of the difference.  A lot of guys think all they want is sex when theyre young but a lot of that is just because they are getting older and their hormones are starting to give them those sensations to wanting sex or some sexual pleasure.  But if you tell him your true feelings on what is going on between you guys it may cause a slight ammount of tention because he may think that its what you want too but just say that you are not ready to move onto that step of your relationship with him but you will want to someday want to share that experience with him someday.....I have a feeling that he will understand you and see where you are coming from and will see that you feel this way but he will understand why you want to wait to have sex with him........i hope everything works out
MB1oT04maa	so......when you two gettin married?|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Get your ducks in a row now for when he asks you out.  Tell him you are seeing someone that doesn't go to your school.  Be ready if he asks you about your bf.  Tell him that you don't think it would be appropriate to talk about him in school or something like that.    Will your teacher change your seating so you can sit behind him so he can't stare so easily.    Anyway, hang in there.  Only a few more months.|`|BzQp8qUXaa	well make sure the point is dull and dont aim for the eyes or groin.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	That's really tough. Just try to avoid him. He sounds like he might be a little crazy. Thats ur best bet.|`|AA12394131	I would tell him very sincerely and nicely that he seems like a nice person, you do not like him in that way. I would also tell him that his staring makes you uncomfortable. Unfortunately you can't make him stop staring, but by letting him know that it bothers you, that's all you can do. I'm sure if he is as awkward and greasy as you say then this isn't the first time he has been rejected.   If you really feel brave, you would be doing him a service of telling him that if he cleaned up a little and paid more attention to his appearance, someone else might notice him. If you can find something about his appearance that might otherwise be somewhat appealing then bring that up so it's not all negative. For example, nice eyes, etc.   Good luck. Be grateful that you have good enough looks for someone to appreciate and just realize that you can't always blame people for looking. :)|`|OgQG7oNOaa	deal with him until june, but if he really likes you he will most likely make it officialy known before graduation cause he doen't want to not ever see you again. Than you can break it to him gently, but if you can make an extra effort not to tell him than that may just be the best thing cause that could really leave a scar especially if he really likes you; reguardless of how much he stares its a small price to pay for his pain, something you wouldnt want wished upon your self.|`|HieYFt4jaa	Next time he comes up to you look him square in the eye and say:    I think it's very sweet that you like me, but the truth of the matter is I simply do not will I ever feel the same way.    I really don't like the way you stare at me, it makes me uncomfortable and if you really care for me the way you act like you do, you'll give me some space.    I want you to know that we can be friends, but I want you to treat me like one. You are making it aqward for me. How might you feel if it was the other way around?    I feel like you are taking advantage of my niceness. I don't want to be or sound mean, but you have got to stop it.    If you want to be friends that's fine, but the admiration has got to stop.            Let me ask you something miss author. If a guy raped you because he really liked you would that be okay?    What if he was depressed and just really wanted to have you?    I know he's not raping you, but it's even worse in a sense  because it's ongoing. You even mentioned you tried to look less appealing which is something children do when they're molested.    It's NEVER okay to let someone make you feel uncomfortable. It's not your fault if he's got problems, so do you and he's one of them.    Good luck hon.|`|6CUvU9D4aa	i am in EXACTLY the same position as you and our guys sound EXACTLY the same and i dont wanna hurt him either.  its so tough coz boys like them latch on and never let go.  i tried making up an imaginary boyfriend and that worked, like he still liked me but he went into this depressed thing and it made me feel bad so i stopped.  i just try to surround myself with as many friends (especially guy friends) and just have fun.  i invite him to join in whenever he looks like he wants to, coz then its like he isint getting excluded, and he obviously wont have the guts to ask you out in front of a big crowd, and maybe that might like 'satisfy' (lol) his crush on you for a while.  i dont know what i'm going to do.  i just treat him as a friend and nothing more.  if he starts to veer off into talking about how nice i am, then i just go like wow you are SUCH a great FRIEND.  i always make sure to have boys names in my msn, like celebrities or something. he always asks who they are and i tell him,, ohh just some guy.  he stops kinda sliming around me for a while, until i feel bad enough about it that i like try to talk to him to make sure he's okay.  if your dude is suicidal though.. and like totally un-predictable, i know it sucks, like (WHY ME) but you just have to keep telling yourself that he is NEVER going to have the guts to ask you out, especially if you play the on again off again thing (being nice, ignoring). try your best to shut him out, or your life is gonna revolve around trying to avoid HIM. dont let him stop you from having a good time with friends. |`|zYxuYLShaa	ok, let's start from the basics... this guy is obviously attracted to you for more than one reason. A) ur personality, b) ur beauty c) ur brain. People like this may take it the wrong way, but everyone is their own person. You never know how they are gonna react to a situation unless you talk to them about it first. Being the fact that he has not acted upon this situation, i'm guessing he is a shy hearted guy. Has he even told you of his likings? Or has he laid down hints for you? If not you can't be entirely sure about how he actually feels. You will never know whats going on in a persons mind because it's just not possible unless they're honest about everything they say. Even then don't be entirely gullible as what they may tell you because like i said noone knows whats going on in a persons brain. I can honestly say that this has happened to me before and i don't know exactly how they felt because i didn't actually take the time to notice little changes in their behavior. But if you do come to find that this so called guy is actually into you, and you deff. know ur not into him, drop down hints like a friend would do.. make him know that he's only a friend and nothing more. Just make sure you don't flaunt or lead him on because that can really mess a guy up.. i hope this has some assistance to your issue, but i am only 16 and i haven't really lived my life to actually preach ab diff things..
JbKerMCkaa	Dude, I know you'd like women to answer this, but I have some things to think about.  I am a "nice guy" too.  I hold doors open, always get the check and would never think about being rude to a woman.    Women love this, but I've had the same problem...all of a sudden its like they are board.  Here are some suggestions:    - Don't always be the one to chase after her.  Don't be the guy calling all the time.  If she don't call you back then forget it and find someone else....her loss.  She needs to feel that about you because you are a high demand dude and lots of other women out there.    - Try to think about how confident you are coming across.  Sometimes people get humbleness and politeness confused with lack of self confidence.  Don't be afraid to take some risks like joking with her/picking on her or trying to make her laugh but don't be as *** either.     - Know that other chicks prob find you attractive-- use that to your advantage.  When you are on a date then make yourself think that you are "superman"-- hey you are the same height right?  Again, don't be a jerk, but walk with confidence and smile at nod and smile at other girls that smile at you as you get up to go the restroom or walking in/out(but don't go talking to them either!)    - If I had to guess, I think women want a handsome, polite, caring guy that makes good money and is extremely confident (but is also sensitive).  The bad boys pull it off because they turn on the nice side just to play the girl--once she is woo'd then they revert back to their *** self, which girls often confuse as confidence.    Dude, hope this helps-- good luck    -|`|9UNZHnt4aa	don't treat them like crap,  the only reason us women   go for guys like that is because  "nice guys" usually suffocate   us or just aren't confident   enough, you seem like a   great guy, don't treat ladies   like ho's either!  good luck, the right one   will come along..be patient|`|faIaIvDiaa	treat them like ho's you got nothing to lose
X1gOkyNqaa	Yeah my friends do that all the time.

3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	no, she shouldn't be. just because things are not working out for the parents it shouldn't mean the kids need to be dragged into it. he should still love and care for her.|`|o8LJqzZyaa	i hope not!  did that aass holeee mentioned her?

e362f68c6e1820edfc96d26b103cbcaeaa	here is what i think you should do i think you should tell the person who told you he was cheating to get the proof Because if they cant prove it chances are ur b/f is right and they are making it up and also if its another girl doing it could be because she's jealous and likes ur b/f ir if its a guy could be because he likes you but get them to prove it first before jumping the gun
kBRbVsdqaa	Just go up to him and start a conversation with him. and say I want to tel lyou something, but it might be unaccepted. and just say it I like you. I did and now i'm glad it off my chest|`|Ly20pGC9aa	write him a note.  then you wont freak out if he likes you,  and if he dosent, you wont have to face...  REJECTION.
bxlF3MEiaa	yes its a turn off.|`|ugvgt6rMaa	Well some girls don't want to mess with guys that have girls. Just cause they don't talk to you it doesn't mean that you're ugly so don't worry.|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	"If you're not available, then why should I waste my time?"   That is how most girl's brains work.|`|N8GLJpdlaa	i dont think they are turned off i think that they respect your girlfriend and do not want to ruin anything|`|utQC6dhjaa	i think we know your taken so why cause drama|`|40qTdKuPaa	If a guy has a g/f it doesnt change the way he looks or his personality! So,no|`|BIcLN41jaa	they probably don't want to waste their time because they already know that you have a girlfriend......plus maybe you did turn ugly you know the thing called puberty?|`|INybXKozaa	Your not available,  girls fell like they shouldn't even waste their time because   they have no chance..|`|DlGV1xv9aa	you probably did turn ugly... do you remember being hit with any ugly sticks recently?|`|i8BJ0h3Daa	nah girls deliberately stay away from guys with gfs    unless they're messed up|`|cFc8KPIQaa	hahahah no not always sometimes girls will just say to themselves well he has a girlfriend so why would i waste my time on someone that i cant have!! well that's what i do and it's not that you turned ugly just if you have a girlfriend other girls don't want to get in the middle!! =D|`|M82QkRSLaa	nah, its just after a while if you've been with your girlfriend they obviously see that your not gonna be interested in them, so why bother? if yu want the other girls become single lol|`|hpy9JtfSaa	it is a turn off if u have a girlfriend because we don't want to ruin ur current relationship thats not fair to the other girl. if u want other girls to flirt with you maybe u shouldnt be in a relationship.|`|Rmx39jjxaa	If you're already taken, then why should you care if other girls notice you? The only girl that you should make sure notices you is your girlfriend.
VxUWA11Jaa	You should go out with your old friend especially since your relationship with the other guy is going no where, take a chance be adventurous,if you have been going steady for a year with one guy and all you can think about is another guy then you should break up with your boyfriend and go out with your old friend... im giving you the same advice i got when i was in your shoes and i we dated for a long time but he moved so that was the only bad part but it will work out great for you... GOOD LUCK...|`|VQGjYY4faa	if u really feel this way about this guys u should give it ago with him otherwise u will always have to WOT IF thoughts in ur head
alaUYtRcaa	i thnk he is trying to make you jelous it seems like he likes youu
6NbFy1KPaa	I hope you do grow up.  For your sake.
AA10172433	Your problem has nothing to do with your age; it has to do with a very common occurance resulting from your unwillingness to accept your flaws. I'm going to guess that you are a perfectionist: you have not accepted that everyone has flaws and that it's okay for you to have yours. Because you have not accepted your own flaws, you cannot accept flaws in the girls you date. Now he's where the paradox kicks in: because you know deep down that you are flawed, you have the subconcious thought process of: "Any girl who would like me must deeply flawed, for I am flawed and no sane person would thus like me, therefore I really should not like her, in light of this realization." To put it more simply, "Any girl who would date me isn't good enough for me." Have you ever heard the joke about the man who wouldn't join any country club that would take him as a member? That's what's happening with you. The solution is simply to accept yourself and your flaws and raise your self-esteem. You need to realize that no one is perfect, and that although you have flaws, you're still a worthy person who is worthy of another's love.
Z28PnDjgaa	She is probably insecure, there is somethingmising from her life. Talk to her about it.
9qiLZp50aa	Tell her stories about your day, tell her jokes, ask her questions about her own life. Don't just ramble on and on; give the girl time to talk to! And if she tells a story, pay attention. Talk about friends, sports, politics, religion Hope that helped. :)|`|oMJzG6aWaa	ask her how her day was  how is she feeling. dont be freaid to question what she is feeling.|`|NoZAofgOaa	try to avoid those awkward  silent moments.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	anything things she is interested in and keep her in the conversation dont judt ramble on|`|5QxrQF7yaa	Dont talk on the phone it is point less and a waste of time  just make fun of her but just like play full things like sayin she weak or that u r cooler than her and stuff like that. make sure to make alot of contact with her by like givin her like pushes or leaning against her
GCufUbxJaa	Just tell them it's over. of course it's gonna take a while to get over. what break up doesn't?  But you can find better guys than that. Just break up with them.
YNPNfbf8aa	well i loved 9-12 grade history and maybe shes really into it and you should let her read stuff and through a pre 2000 year party but dont make her stop.  and to really awnser youre problem it is veeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyy wierd . she will have no friends very soon
6GFw9gkraa	BE OBVIOUS!!    lol, if only more girls would be...    Do you know how confuzing girls can be?? obviously dont just go up to him and leap into his arms, but generally just make it known to him that you like him... If he's into you, get in there =P If not, well then there's plenty more fish in the sea =)    Booyakasha.|`|GfCRiueRaa	It's nice to know. I feel flattered. hahaha!

glPyjitIaa	well im a cheerleader so i have this personal motto:   If you're dating a cheerleader raise you hand   If you're not, raise your standards    it's a little conceitd but....  I would choose the 2nd, and you should take it slow with her, but not too slow cause then she'll get bored    But def. don't choose the first one, if you went out with her already and it wasn't that great Y WOULD YOU GO WITH HER AGIAN???   lol- good luck wit h whoever you choose|`|zWqKuIQuaa	Very bizarre way to choose a girlfriend.  It's kinda like picking out a new outfit.  Should I wear what i already have or wait 2 weeks and save up for something new.
3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	It takes allot to say your sorry for making someone feel uncomfortable. Now the next step is to leave her alone and let her get on with her life.     I don't think it sounds anything like a rapist but if you don't leave her alone from now on then you will certainly start looking like a stalker.    Let her make a move that shows she might be into you before you do anything else regarding her.|`|eAVMxMoMaa	....?|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	i think your friend was trying to be sarcastically funny and it didn't really work out for him. because in order for it to be semi funny, it has to make sense to the situation. i don't think i would relate a rape case to your situation.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think apologizing if you felt you crossed the line by being overly pushy is totally acceptable.|`|Bg9NxBG0aa	im sorry, i dont understand..|`|Wbmpv8i5aa	that doesn't sound like something from a rape trial those other ppl are way to over dramatic. answer mine please?  :)http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|vVxM4sPIaa	Well first, what did you say/do when you were being pushy?|`|YV0hGLh0aa	um no it doesn't! if a guy was nice enough to apologize for something like that i would date him!|`|PpRvEETQaa	she's weird.|`|ztd2mEvaaa	A. your friend is an as$hole  B. appologizing isnt out of line, but "im not that bad" would make the girl think somethin else...idk what
6L8AFxwdaa	i suggest u don't do it. you would honestly regret it later on :P  i mean even thought you both love each other (and TRUST me i know how hard it is to hold yourself lol) you kinda do have boundaries especcially because of religious reasons|`|VrmlehM2aa	yikes.  well, if you guys are in love, and you are completely sure of it.. then thats your choice.    but.. if your not allowed to date, i wouldnt do anything. because in the end everythingg will just come right back up to bite you in the @$$. trust me i know :P
eWPtcuENaa	well it seems that she is completely against doing anything her parents dont want her ta do which is good but i know that makes i really hard and can be annoying with things like this. But i dont see why her parents wouldnt let her even see you but i guess some are like that but see if she could try ta convince her parents ta let her see you. i dont think you should forget about her or even move on if you think that you belong with her try ta make it work but maybe you should explore your other choices not just completely block them all out you never know what could happen just keep your eyes open thats all im saying, even if its hard, but i think you should wait til she's 18 and her parents wont hold that against her and see if you still like her til then and see if your connection is still the same or if its something that faded over time and your just holding on to  best of luck i know its hard
oMIxJTO1aa	No one likes to know that their partner had sexual experiences before them, makes most people sick to their stomachs thinking about it, however when you love someone their should be no comparing and if their is in any way comparing negativily ur partner to a past person in your life end it it isnt fair to him/her. Dont over analize wuts best experience b4 or no experience just love them for who they are and make sure your compatiable with all tihngs, sex is a fairly big part in a rs i would advise you having feelings and feeling a connecton, and being pleased with the one your with. Thus i tihnk its important to have much intimacy with them before marriage, or considering getting engaged. You wouldnt want to get married and realize afterward you feel no connection with that person.|`|zGi9Wag3aa	Yes. It's good to know what you're doing.
bB8b7HXvaa	Well, it depends on the situation. If the guy she likes is going to be an asshole and treat her like crap, you should probably find a way to subtly tell her that and that it worries you.    If she isn't heading into what is exactly a bad direction, well there isn't much you can do. Every human has their own free will, that which no other person has the right to interfere with or manipulate. If she doesn't have the same feelings for you, it probably would not have worked out anyways. Usually problems arise out of relationships in which one person is more passionate and dedicated than the other.    I have had very strong feelings for a girl for the past 7 months. Like you, I've been close friends with her and gone on a few dates with her. She doesn't like another guy, as far as I know, but she certainly doesn't have similar feelings towards me. I realized that it would never work if she could never share my passion, and moved on.    It might hurt a lot, but when things are bad there is always a point where they couldn't get any worse, and from there you can only go up. Every human must learn to be independent and detach from discouraging times in their lives.    If you can't get over her, don't give up. Stay friends with her and wait it out. Never give up hope in any situation. It's not as if she'll be with this guy for the rest of her life. And honestly, in my experience I've discovered that while you're waiting it out a better girl happens to come along in your life and turn things around.    Whatever happens, I hope it works out for you. Good luck.|`|cf7CUClpaa	sorry to hear that  if u guys dated before why arent u guys now  it sound like she broke up with u   theres really nothin u could do  think of it this way   at least u had her before
N8GLJpdlaa	check for a ring = make sure he isn't married  check for man bag = make sure he isn't gay   then see his book = good literature = intelligent  and drink and then go and talk to him|`|oYcKNtiGaa	Thats hot I would think hes pretty intelligent... but i guess it depends on what hes reading lol. But i find italian guys pretty attractive and i would hope he have an accent... Accents are hot lol. Huge turn on for me... but im way to shy so i wouldnt do much. Just probably glance at him and pray he comes and talk to me lol
nZ7pGQfFaa	Not for me.  As long as it has girth and you know how to work it.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Honestly, accordint to the Kama Sutra, there are 3 sizes of men and 3 sizes of women. they are all animal names. Basically, the small man goes with the small woman. The large with large and well you know the rest. So, if a big man is with a small women, it's uncomfortable, and if a small man is with a big woman, it's not going to work. So yes, it does matter, but more along the lines of compatability.|`|AA12359831	depends.
ASTrT0Gqaa	Confront HER!|`|zVZB1Hpwaa	OMG!Samething happened to me!I hate those kinds of people!She was just using you and tell her on the phone and bock her on myspace that you are very mad about that and you dont like to be used!If you want yall can still talk but thats very rude of her!|`|LN4dAkWQaa	tell her what happened after the fighting and tell her that you feel excluded but if you dont want to be friends with her anymore jsut say i dont like the way you have been treating me you are really nice and all but it just hurt me when you 'left me hanging' when we where suppossed to hang out together that time!
2aE0BxfFaa	Her body. Body can always make an average face look good. By the way your picture looks good and I would have sex with you.|`|ITPSa0d6aa	Hair, eyes, and scent.
jlubFDxUaa	give him a chance.they  say looks are not everything . the  fact you guys connect, he is nice to you will make  you happier and then ou will like him more and more becasuse he treats you goo d and is a gentleman though he is not your type exactly.|`|QkKXX6igaa	decide that he totally is amazing and perfect, and make it a fact, that's all i can think of.  but really don't try that cause it will end in a mess.
6p5UGMwuaa	yes, i have seen it ..in some korean show.|`|VgMasCAKaa	no|`|x8RA1ENvaa	Is that kid strong?
bRoSGSxLaa	personally, i would not avoid you purposley if that happened  you sound like a really nice guy and im sure that any girl would be lucky to be with you.  and no, im not just saying that to make you feel better. but nobody is perfect, not in the slightest bit..and even though it sounds like it can be tough sometimes i think that someone should be able to look past your small stutter and see what a great guy you are.  =]  i hope i helped|`|uLeXGHnKaa	I don't think it would bother most girls unless you were unintelligible. I find slight speech impediments very endearing and i'm sure other girls feel the same way, and if you're attractive and have a good personality I don't see why it would bother anyone! Just try not to be too self conscious about it. :)|`|08tdupUSaa	practice is key.  talk to girls.  any girl.  get over your stutter.    somegirls might not care but it's not the most attractive thing to do.  just work it out:)|`|F1l7MBsOaa	i wuldnt care cuz i stutter to|`|GQiMXAX3aa	i would not. i think that if the girl you're talking to isn't interested because of the stutter, then she isn't the type of girl you want to be dating. be confident in who you are, it will show. the girl for you will not care.
JqD8in5Naa	"You're creepy, get away from me."    -Every girl you've ever talked to.
EtLDmuhqaa	  just go &&  start dancing  with some girlz  there...that way  you'll get to   meet some....  is nothing bad  =]
AhtaOu9aaa	sorry but the friends never lie...dont ask
LMRaSXFeaa	hahahahhahahhahahaha lmfao. thats hilarious. XD|`|nBNzYDpLaa	Oxymoron - No such thing as good pickup lines. :)  But I love them, they're so amazingly hilarious.   Uh I'm not sure I know of a funniest. Lamest would be "nice legs.. when do they open?"|`|LlE4qJZtaa	hahah thats pretty funny
VbrvE128aa	Well, i think if "Day's" a close friend guy, he's only watching out for you. That same thing happened to me and I thought the my bestfriend guy liked me but he was only saying those things because he found out some information that he didnt wanna say that hurt my feelings. He jus said it in a way where i wudnt get mad. So maybe u shud talk to him and ask him is it more to this story and if u guys are real friends it will work!|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	day likes you, day wants to date you , thats why he doesnt want you to date jay|`|afNGvd9Laa	dude day likes you! he doesnt want you to go out with jay!|`|jVFsl9FBaa	Okay, well 'Jay' obviously likes you if that's the way he acts around you.  'Day' may like you as well, but he could just be jealous that another guy is going to be as close/closer to you as him.    I suggest that you confront 'Day', and ask him what's going on.  But at the mean time, talk to 'Jay', get to know him.  If 'Day' does like you, let him down easily, but let him know that you still be there for him, but only as friends, but if he's just jealous, give him some space and time to get over that, and go for it with 'Jay'.    I hoped I helped at least a little :)  Good luck!
FC378Lcraa	does he laugh often at the things you say, whether or not they're actually funny? if yes he probably likes you.
eNA4LIyFaa	yes, ignore your friends... the only time you should listen to your friends' advice when it comes to dating is if theyre genuinely trying to help you out because they fear for you, that you will get hurt because they think the guy is a bad guy.... but if the only thing they have against him is that hes "dorky" then who cares? If you dont see it and if you like him for who he is, then go for him! You may one day regret it if you dont! Live your life, dont let your friends live it for you!!!!|`|3TdT5mG2aa	You cannot change anyone... Either accept him as he is or move on. That's why us girls always end up heart-broken and lonely. We cannot "fix" someone. If you like him for who he is, date him. If you plan on "fixing" him, don't waste your time.|`|t4BpFdmdaa	compare him with poo.  if hes better then poo  then who cares what ya firends say!    u get what i mean by "poo" right? not talking about the "poo..poo"|`|FcNOkHquaa	Why would you need to change him?  If you like him for him, then you shouldn't need to change him, why would you like him for what your friends think of him?  Really that's just stupid, because if he really makes you happy then who cares if he's a little dorky.....    /m|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	Who cares what others think. As long as he makes you happy, go for it! Live life for yourself, not for others!    G'luck:)|`|QrOJ8f7aaa	He likes you, you like him: go for it. If you're friends are really going to judge you based on who you're dating then they don't really sound like friends to me.|`|SF5WnQFQaa	JERK! DONT CHANGE HIM IF U REALLY LIKE HIM U WON'T CARE! UR JUST DESPERATE TO GET A GUY! AND EVERYBODY ACTS GOOFY AND DORKY EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE!|`|40qTdKuPaa	Go for him. It doesnt matter what your friends think, they wont be the one who dates him or likes him, so its non of their businesses. Do what you want, you will find out if he is truly weird or not some time soon, so you wont loose anything. Hope this helps|`|sdYoRJnUaa	It depends if your hot or not if your hot dont go out with some nerd, but if your a nerd than go out with him|`|AsSMWbdyaa	Go for what you think best!  i took a similar risk and the boy i thought was a lil odd is my soulmate! We've been together almost 3 years!|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	if you want to go out with him, go.  you can not change anybody.  do you want to be changed?|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Haha. Just go for it. I did that, and listened to my friends, and when i stopped caring and asked her out, the girl didnt like me anymore. So, stop being worried about them. Plus, they can call him weird and dorky, but they arent the ones gettin some. ;P|`|Mdv5lv8haa	go for it....if our not freindswith him......mae freins to me the weirdest are te funnest and will keep you laughng...people are super judgemental.....they go by what the tink...personally lik at shool iftheres like a boy wit potential sttin alone and is always alone o something i allllwys wanna be frends wit them...at least youll no hes bein real and not afraid to be hmself if he does turn outto be weir....tell yourfrends stop sippin that hateraid lol|`|UtTv0we8aa	Ok so your friends think he is dorky but it only matters what you think anyway. Your friends are not going to be dating him now are they? If he is not that great then you can always dump him, but what if he is awesome? You wont know untill you at least give him a chance, and really what have you got to lose by giving him a chance?|`|KjBtYA5Uaa	ok well dont try to change him either u like him for who he is and not who u want him to be or u just dot like him. it doesnt matter what ur friends say its what amtters what u think not them. follow ur heart if u want him go for him if u dont like him keep looking|`|pOYsO3xzaa	go for him|`|CckFjXIPaa	go out with him, your friends will probably forget about in a day...|`|Nc9aASDlaa	Don't listen to what others say. If you want o go for him, go for him.|`|PhdK3S6uaa	do what you want. he wont be their boyfriend.|`|HresywF6aa	go for him your not going to miss out on anything and he only probably seems weird because he likes you a lot|`|nT31zeQaaa	yur ugly then too|`|6AP6fmtmaa	Well if you really like him then go for ti, if your friends can't like the guy you're with because he looks a bit nerdy, then they  re just shallow. Also all the successful people in life are not the cute jocks they're the nerd that does well in school. Also don't force change into him.|`|w9vDlXLIaa	First off, dont ever think you can change someone.  If you dont like them as they are dont go for it.  Setting yourself up for disappointment.    Its good to be concerned, you dont want to get into something you didnt want.  Get to know him first, dont test the water with both feet, doesnt work.|`|cb4HEkGhaa	If you really like the guy you should go for him and if your friends say  tha you are stupid and stuff like that then they are not your real friends|`|BBws5hl7aa	some guys get really hot when they grow up!  im independent and i hate my friends, so do like me and FOLLOW YOU HEART! if you dont like him after you just break up.  simple,ah?|`|VYEJXGutaa	It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks- if you like him then go for it! If he's to weirs and things don't work out your young who cares! You can always end things if they don't work out. Trust me you will have plenty of guys that you like and plenty you decide are not for you before you find that ONE special guy! So if you like him and he makes you happy then thats all that matters. If your friends are really your friends they will support whatever you decide and give him the same benefit of the doubt that you did :)|`|fyP3WLoPaa	I would get more information about why they think he is weird and if you can live with why they think that go for it.  If they have some real reservations maybe you should trust them if it's unanimous.|`|LrMG7L7iaa	Ok, so your friends should support u in whatever decision you EVER want to make about this "guy". And they aren't very good friends if they don't. So I say just go for it girl, its not like they can make you not go out with him. I totally would, and if it turns out, he is weird, than u can always brake up with him. Hope I helped!|`|YEjhx5Mvaa	just go for it you only live life once|`|uKYPmVG0aa	first thing you should do is BREATHE.. don't stress! now.. you should ask him out- who cares if he may be a dork or what ur friends think, it's what's in ur heart that matters. now if u really like this guy before u date him then why would u wanna change him?? i'll tell u why.. u r too afraid of what other people will say and if he really is weird just break up with him if u don't like the way things r going!|`|IJJHxvBxaa	Who gives a **** what your friends think. Its what you want. If he makes you happy then your friends should respect that. YOur friends should want you to be happy.|`|R7DKpBF3aa	go out with him, your friends will get used to it. if they are real friends they will just appericate that your happy. (:|`|aaPx1eehaa	ignore ur friends. if there true friends they'll support your ideas. trust me, i think eveyones answer will say that! Dorks are the cute ones ;)|`|y19LFO28aa	Go for it!  But don't change him, especially if you think hes dorky.  I know this sounds corny, but like him for who he is, and so what if your friends think hes weird, they are probabley a little weird themselves.|`|RkARvAIcaa	Don't put soooo much weight in your interactions with him. Just treat him like a human being. Talk to him as you would talk to anyone else. Only then can you truly gauge what's best for you.|`|jAvK15bcaa	"He is a little dorky but I can always change him a little."    Isn't that a part of what makes him, him? You shouldn't want to change a person if you like them.  Like them for who they are.  Your friends will always have your back and try and tell you whats best for you, but thats whats best for you in their opinions. Really if you like this guy go for it.  If he ends up being a weirdo, break up.  And tell your friends they were right, whats the big deal?|`|xg0jALAgaa	Do it for yourself and not others! It's better to know that you have tried then live your life not knowing what could have happened. If you think he might be weird observe and take in what he's all about. No rushing. Never go into a relationship thinking you will be able to change the other person because your just setting yourself up to fail...|`|KWMNBkj2aa	haha, wow, my best friend had the EXACT same issue as you. they broke up tho. well, if you love him that's all that really matters. if your friends are your TRUE friends, they'll love you for whatever decision you choose. its YOUR love, not theirs. you should go on and give him a try, what could you lose exept friends who only care about you for who you date?? good luck!|`|FPNiPio1aa	Listen I'm no guru on the subject of relationships, but I will tell you this much. You say you like him, go for it . Don't try to change people, they are not meant to be changed. In time though people seem to evolve so to speak. And don't worry about what anyone thinks it's your heart not theirs......|`|edcTNpg8aa	He's probably a nerd lol. You are one too probably
pQGUPITeaa	Ugh it's the same for everyone.    I think once you turn 50 or get hugely fat they tend to stop.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	i know the feeling their pervs. just ignore them|`|0KzRdOvyaa	whenever i see people staring at me i say "What?!" or "Can I help you?"  then they stop :]|`|62T9Kozfaa	lmao i know ! always happens , sorry old men cant help it|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Glare at them and say, "Got a problem?"
ye6IiFr7aa	start crying at school. and ask your friend to help you. get alone with him in a room and tell him. be like "I hate my family for doing this to me. I dont want to!! Just i hate it its not fair. Im gonna run away if i have to." hell be like whats wrong.. look him straight in the face and say "im moving across the country...."|`|10f326a8d361451c48ca6d61e9c457e0aa	We are spreading out.  You will be seeing less of your friend.|`|v6KSGrlJaa	tell him you meet someone more interesting|`|iwvRBeXOaa	You just tell him and explain why. It's not quantum physics.
edfRUVeSaa	all depends. you can't ever forget someone you were close to, especially if you loved them. there's some girls i've dated i honestly never ever think about and others, one in particular, that i think of quite often (cuz i'm single). you can't forget the people you've loved nor should you. but you can move on. and i suggest getting out with friends and going out and being active. staying in and being cooped up only leads your mind wondering and putting you into a depressive state. don't worry. i've loved and lost before too and you DO get better. no worries
udQvs0kZaa	Because it gives us a sense of security. Deal with it, she must actually like you.     *edit*     I forgot to put my smiley.... = P    Ok, I'm good. But really, the arm is a symbol of protection, so maybe she just likes to feel like you are there for her.|`|vk5R3sCzaa	It's just a form of affection.  I do it because I like holding my man.|`|zoTbkas9aa	because they like to get close to that guy see if he is a romantic or a pig|`|oMIxJTO1aa	I dno i know my gf loves holding hands, or my arm and such, perhas the same reason u like her doing it, being close i presume? =p|`|yLn54k8qaa	Because were big and strong and they feel safe when in our arms|`|gJE0ujbzaa	It's a form of possessiveness. They are showing everyone "this is MY man!"    And, they are showing the man they like him, and want to be near him.      If the guy doesn't like it, he's dating the wrong woman...or he has some issues he needs to deal with.|`|PeYs53sHaa	my lady always grabs my arm or hand, wraps her arm around me. i love it.
OaxhMKr5aa	guys like to chase. so back off a lil and let him come to/ chase you okay. Good Luck! :)|`|SzL9vUkSaa	Whoa, nice problem, I like to solve these!  Well pushing it is a great way to start, yea walking with him and talking to him is really nice and all that stuff.  He probably didnt call you back that day bcuz he either had to go to sleep, his mom didnt let him or he had something else to do.  When you called out his name and he flashed that smile on you that is a good sign! (:   Same thing he probably didnt msge you back bcuz he had something else to do.  When both of you are walking down the hall or something make sure you should be the one leaving first and saying bye an all that so he will think you have other things to do and that will live him thinking of you.  hope this helped.    Good Luck! (:|`|osEdRAFLaa	aaw baby dont get sad,, he just doesnt wana come off as too desperate. and he didnt respond because hes nervous or maybe he was just busy on myspace. . really it will be ok
oxbqtLDeaa	girl please, this boy is ... well a boy. with that kinda past all hes wantin from you is sex, plain and simple. i aint sayin that if you do get with this boy your gonna get rapped or somthing, but it wont last very long, even if you do give him what he wants, considering the fact thats he's already had 14 girls like you, you would just be another girl caught in his web. I say you should just drop this boy like hes hot, n move on to the next fish in the sea :)|`|bZGv0dvnaa	he's playing u girl.. but if u want to be his lucky 15 then go for the goal.. =p|`|0dd0cKUGaa	If he is talking about sex before you even begin dating that should tell you what he is most interested in. Don't forget that your intentions may not be the same as his. Sure you may like him and want a relationship, but his definition of "like" may just be that he would like to have sex with you. Figure out what you want for yourself and what you want from him. Make sure he can provide or help you achieve what you are wanting. Then its up to you to decide if you believe him and if its something you want.
7yrdcqY1aa	omg he is a jerk do not ever try to get bake together with him!|`|BPwpQV6faa	Way hotter. white girls are whiney
iwvRBeXOaa	I hate to be blunt, but maybe they just aren't attracted to you. It sounds like you keep these guy "friends" around for some sort of ego boost, and that's not what friends are for.    If you want guys to notice you you need to be less a friend and more an unattainable girl. I'm sure the girls they comment on don't just hang out with them like you do so they appear more mysterious.    And BTW, I don't care how old you are, you should never be upset about teenage boys not writing stupid comments like "damn girl, you look so good!" on your pictures. Time to grow up and not care so much what other boys think and instead make sure you are comfortable with who you are.
ztb7OCvyaa	Find another nickname for him that he likes just as well but that doesn't make you feel weird.
KpEayiqcaa	dude, no ones gonna hang out with someone they dont know, could be dangrous for them, could be dangrous for you.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	Use myspace for that, or face book, search for users by location.|`|iCKkOWI7aa	ok can u meet me in melbourne, australia by 5pm tonight?|`|64d7116e9576cea4e490b98f53879fa8aa	I'd love too, but I live no where near you.|`|X25iYK97aa	stop touching little kids|`|anDVgcO6aa	NECRO LOOKS LIKE NE-YO!  (IN YOUR PIC IN YOUR PIC.)  GOOD JOB MAN,   JUST WHY WOULD YOU ASK THIS, DAWG?  GO OUT THERE AND HANG OUT WITH SOME PEEPS.  PERFECT.
PWojmBN6aa	say how hot you think he is and how you guys should hang out    what turns me on alot is low cut jeans with a tank top
oYcKNtiGaa	well thats why cuz im in that same situation... when ur having a convo and ur smiling n laughing alot they consider that '' flirting ''... theyre just losers|`|q8vILEpfaa	Take a good look at how you laugh a lot.  You are coming across as a flirt!|`|AA10627005	I think that you are probably a very friendly & outgoing person & guys are sometimes ignorant & get the wrong idea or they just like to brag|`|oekHFU0Aaa	You are probably just a natural flirt and don't even realize.
VrmlehM2aa	you know what, im a girl, and i USED to be into guys like this, but i have no idea.    alot of girls just want what they can't have.  i know it sounds childish, but if a guy is just super sweet, and always there theres no "action".     but dont turn into one of those total jerks. the girls will realize that they should'nt be wasting their time with a$$h0les like this.      hope i helped :)
cWy17SRnaa	Tell her that if she can give you her number.  Good luck.
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	When you had close day-after-day contact with him, it was not working so you separated.    What has changed since then?    Or is it that you have not found anyone else, and are so lonely you would consider saying "maybe it wasn't so bad"?     Get busy - find things to do where you will meet new people.  Stay active - and you will find someone.|`|JIATcwW6aa	There are a fair number of couples who end up back together.  Once apart, the often see where priorities in their relationship should or should not be.  It depends on the circumstances around it.  I would not get back with someone, say, for the sake of the kids.  Or if I had been in an abusive relationship.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	no  let it be ... start a new life ...|`|mO5mwS0Uaa	You left him for a reason.  Has it changed?  Are children involved?  If so, they will be very confused.  Think long and hard before you decide.|`|Y08YLysXaa	It depends. A year is a long time to be separated. What was the issue? I don't think it's a good idea.|`|AkTw3RQuaa	GO TO THERAPHY  has the situation gotten better or worse ?  you need to access the reason you left  are you going back into the same mess?  are you happier without him?  do you have kids..does he provide for you & the kids  is he abusive ?
M82QkRSLaa	def go for it be like ayy, we've been kickin it since the sandbox whatup|`|x0KszFPMaa	well... do you see him around and stuff?  all i am saying is don't make things awkward for yourself if you do have to see eachother in person
yTD84yFlaa	Be confident in yourself and what you're hoping for.  The entire idea behind 'be yourself' is retarded; you need to 'Be your best qualities'.  Yeah that would be a better statement.      Be polite, open doors for her, etc.  Maybe bring a small present. Nothing -serious- though.  No matter who else is around, treat her right no matter what.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Progressively push the envelope. Call her hun or honey and see how she takes it. Maybe place a hand on her shoulder. That should push the boundaries far enough to ask her out.    Good luck, comrade!|`|0ujpiBTCaa	Have an awesome time. Make sure she has an awesome time.   Don't be tooo over the top feely or flirty.    When it comes time to part, then ask her if she would be interested in going out sometime. Word it in a way that she knows you mean a date. If she had an awesome time, she should say yes, and you two can start dating.    (In regards to the first response- careful with that. A lot of women, myself included, would be insulted and grossed out if a guy called me "hun" or "honey")|`|zoTbkas9aa	if want to be with her then when you meet her tell her how you feel. Girls love to hear that boys like them it makes them feel good|`|nSdYPN8Raa	after hanging out with her just say to her "i really enjoyed myself today, and i really like you... so i was just wondering if you wanted to go out with me" its as simple as that, and make sure you ask before you go your separate way or any time when the mood is right that way it wont be awkward if she says "no"  OH! and be sure to hint that you like her while your hanging out so maybe she'll pick up on it  GOOD LUCK =)|`|AA11835015	is it this saturday or every saturday? if every saturday, be cool don't press it. you may begin to spend other time than saturdays. if you mean you'll meet her just this saturday, see how things go, ask her what she's doing sunday and if you are both free, come up with an idea of something to do. a matinee would be good on sunday to not be out late before school or work. if she goes for it, maybe she wants more of a relationship! good luck... and be yourself.|`|ovIxSVKbaa	wear a cool hat. something from the 80's like with a poofball on it or something|`|qajX3kzPaa	you might want to flirt with her a little bit if you do want your relationship with her to go somewhere :)|`|ee6M6L2waa	then ur in a relationship, or rather a first date. U should know,cuz most girls don't ask, so therefor u must have right?|`|vIr0Y0EVaa	Give hints or just ask her out right. And be yourself :D|`|DOSUTY74aa	are you hanging out with this girl because you like her or just because you want to have a relationship. if it's the former, then tell her how you feel. good luck!!!|`|JkQ62zOmaa	The naked man.    I hope this helps!!|`|wslLZUXqaa	first, be yourself, cause if all else fails, then you  are screwed. but takes things slowly and let nature  take its course.|`|doMV803Iaa	STICK IT IN HER POOPER!!!!!!     No but seriously, you should probably slowly go into a relationship by giving her hints such as getting close to her, flirting, etc. Then once you build a nice, healthy relationship, follow the former advice. :)|`|1N4gjndpaa	Just hang out with her, dude. Don't worry about it, and see where it goes. One of the most important things I've learned about dating is that I don't want a girl I have to bend over backwards to impress. Maybe try asking her, at the end of the date, if she wants to go out again, so you can find out if she's interested too.
6L8AFxwdaa	play 20 questions, most being different types of girls hes interested in, and some like who do you like?    thats wat i kinda did
x51SQHxDaa	dump his ***
5z8uDqmIaa	IDK|`|T3NAVsx1aa	First of all, do u really know her or is she just another pretty face? Ask her why she wont go out with you. smile at her. Just be cool about it and dont make it obious that u are desperate. be nice 2 her. compiment her clothes. dont give **JUST LIKE STEVE URCLE!!!!!!!!** LOL. anyways just show her that u care and she will luv that. but u CANNOT let her take advantage of you. when i say be nice, i dont mean let her walk all over you because when girls know they can do that 2 a guy, then they will. TRUST ME!!!!!!! just like be smart about it but if u know its not going 2 go anywhere just try 2 be her frend and maybe once she gets 2 know u better, SHE will b the 1 lookin  4 a date with u!|`|j5Zm7Rndaa	u have to respect that man. If you two were friends than just tell her that you respect her decision, but you still want to be friends with her (if you guys havent been talking). Then take it slowly and when you think she developed feelings for you then go in.    If you two werent friends... well you have to give up.
ztd2mEvaaa	id say about 13 or 14...personally, i was 6. but thats just a different story haha      i think a lot of it has to do with how you and your peers were raised, where you live (urban,suburban, rural), social situations...so many factors    but i think on average, 13-14|`|BuQSBF8baa	mine was in 5th grade
yLxuHxHbaa	uhhhhh he has a gf? Dont be a boyfriend stealer!!!|`|cb7YfH5caa	easy 10...........stfu ***** tired of you people all ways coming on the internet with your relationship problems ******* noob get over your self|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Well he has a girlfriend so you might wanna back off until they break up. Then let him know you're available.|`|gBoBPNH1aa	thats gross that you're into your brother|`|iRIkf5zXaa	Wear a tight outfit and ask him out, they aint married yet so he isn't locked down yet. Sooner the better.|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	Don't tell him you like him if he already has a gf. One time, I told my friend that I liked him, but I never knew he was taken, and then he told me he was, and it messed things up.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	let him know you interested. You never know what could happen!|`|unQAMrETaa	how have u been knowing him since birth|`|0X9x5YrOaa	Leave him alone. If he really likes you then he would have broken up with his gf already. Don't be the "other woman".|`|aOfq8Pgeaa	Don't ever mess with a guy with a girlfriend. Thats wrong and I dont think you would appreciate it too much if you were in her shoes.|`|OyjRhwPXaa	stuff your bra and wear your thong on the outside    trust me|`|55ba826da159dd00bcca0f4fbb24c899aa	I say do not do anything.  If you know this kid from church it is probably not the best idea to try and come between him and his gf.  Wait it out. Get to know each other better. Then if it doesn't work out with the gf then make your move!|`|Dz2a9jQraa	Don't come on to him or anything, he's taken! Just try to be good friends with him for now....you never know, maybe they'll break up and you can tell him how you truly feel...not that you should wait for him, either! :o)|`|j4Mjc4Ecaa	you could try to text him, and see if he wants to hang out.  At first I'd start out w/ a group of friends, then as you two get to know eachother drop the number of people who come with you.  Be flirty (but not over the top) and dress cute...MOST IMPORTANTLY: be yourself.  Guys hate girls who pretend to be something they're not!  If he cant accept you for who you are, then your relationship will be based on lies.  Hope this helps and good luck gurrrlll!|`|jJoZ1nvVaa	well um he has a gf... so if he suddenly breaks up with her or vice versa then flirt but til then talk to him let him know you. thats all i can say|`|MPnhrXmoaa	well, if he feels the same bout u you'd know it.. i guess thats all i've got to say! good luck.. and by the way... thats kinda weird 16 and 14.. idk.. just wouldnt look or sound ryte to me or anyone else.. kinda eew.|`|MW2eIGyYaa	just be  your self and it depends what kind of flirting he does maybe he is intrested maybe hes not just wait for more clues that tells you he likes you|`|k74TBgCCaa	umm ... i say if i were you .  i'd keep things how they are now if not maybe just get to keep knowing him more .  i mean how serious is his relationship with the girl he's with now .?  I mean their bound to break up sooner or later .  right .?  i mean you could let him know that your into him now;  but there's always that chance of ruining things .  ya know .?  best of luck .!  (:

sCr2iTczaa	Look does your mom ask to meet your friend or her parents before you hang out with them, because if not then just tell your om you made a new friend, or if you just have other friends say you are going over there and instead go meet the boy.|`|qjuqSq7Gaa	message him on the MSpace. tell him you really miss hangin with him. if he is interested he will say he wants to chill sometime|`|AWoH1oN0aa	go to his house....meet up somewhere|`|TQzDd2zCaa	get his number, and text him (:|`|uM9vh4X3aa	Ooh. Now I know it sucks to suck up to your parents but as you're kind of grounded, try and work them round as they might find out about you meeting him behind their back, the best policy I find is to be straight up with your folks with who you're going out with and where and some idea what your plans are. For the meantime, carry on with messaging, be flirty but not too much, keep him hooked. Don't worry, your parents will come around, once you've shown them that you're sorry or whatever, and tell them that you'd like to meet up with a boy, somewhere like a coffee shop where you can just talk more in the flesh. Hope that helped, good luck!|`|e22c69d9c930e30e0d8bcfc48f81dd6faa	I really don't see why you're having a problem here.    Fine, you're not allowed to go to your best friend's house....but in terms of this boy problem.....it doesn't matter because your best friend's house is not where you want to be, is it?.....you want to be round his or seeing him.    It's like me saying, I really want to go to the supermarket, but I can't because I'm banned from the shop next door. It makes no sense does it?!    Ask him out to town over myspace.    If you were wrong and he doesn't like you, it doesn't matter. You're not allowed around your friend's house so you'll hardly see him anyway.    If you were right, you can start going round his house instead - and you're not banned from there. lol    Do you see what I mean? I can't see why you consider this situation a problem, it isn't one.
2qmKDhmzaa	looks - tall, built, clean cute, nice eyes  personality - funny, sweet, respectful, fun, trustworthy|`|n3xoGNzBaa	honesty, and a lot of the guy's attention|`|qTHkBmH6aa	respect and attention    :)|`|QHx95iZDaa	In a guy we look for respect, honesty,humor,playfulness, a good character, good morals, and he has to be interesting and not lazy and many more. We also look for someone that can be a best friend and be there when we really need it.|`|WPipgT9vaa	respect|`|KXYqCgWxaa	i agree respect|`|9B40I3MZaa	u gotta be nice to her, respect her beliefs|`|d49ZA5xYaa	It really depends on the girl, I think that you just have to be yourself and be nice to her. Girls like to feel special, so just give her a lot of attention. If you don't be yourself, then she will be able to tell!|`|xEJm0NCiaa	girls love t.v, chick flicks (yuk),  soap opera (also yuk) e.g. eastenders (if your from england)|`|Zs2ce63laa	honesty|`|mOBDEBDZaa	we want guys to be nice, and respectful. do cute things for us. not be afraid to come up to us when were with our friends. be nice to our friends. bring us around your friends, and still treat us good. hold our hand, and hug/kiss us like you mean it. we just want us to be nice and love us.|`|wscyjkPAaa	You can't really generalize.  I think having a sense of humor is a good start.  Surprise her with something from time to time.  Just be an overall gentleman, treat her nice, respect her, and if you like her make sure you let her know before somebody else does.|`|fHALFeisaa	Different girls like different things. Get to know a girl that you like and try to do things that you think she would like too. Just be yourself and you'll find a girl that likes you for who you are, that sounds cheesy and cliche but it works! You don't wanna be with girl who doesn't know the real you!|`|cm3yuGRJaa	1) someone who will actually love them  2) someone who will be faithful to them  3) someone who will not lie to them  4) someone who will listen to them   5) someone who will respect them|`|WdrlFTmYaa	well it depends on the girl. me, i want boys who respect me and that love me for who i am not what i wear or do as a girl.|`|WJZFAsFyaa	i like a boy who treats me with respect, who has a great personality, who likes to have fun, who has a sense of humor, who makes me laugh...i like a boy with a nice body, hazel/green eyes, nice smile, some facial hair, dirty blonde hair...i like a boy who can make me feel absolutely amazing even though i don't feel like i am...lol|`|aIEkNM0Paa	personality, looks, i don't know .. a nice guy will be fine for me|`|2xaVpnNNaa	it varies by the girl.    i like clean cut guys....you know, preppies. i also like guys that are not full of themselves, they have a sorta shy side. i like gentle smiles.....and eyes...those are things i tend to notice real fast.
kA1mYSOtaa	It sounds as if your desire to be engaged stems from your childhood and your wanting to feel loved. The ring would likely symbolize to you that someone loves you so much that they went out of their way to show you their love and affection. I caution you, though, not to jump right into it. At my age, I have seen it happen a hundred times that a girl gets engaged in high school, the relationship ends somehow, she gets engaged again (sometimes twice) in college, and then it gets to the point where engagement is just another "relationship thing" and it loses its luster. My advice would be to wait until you are older and more educated. Not that you are immature now. That's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that you should figure out what you WANT and not just what is "acceptable". When it comes to someone with whom you are going to spend your life, you want to be as selective as possible so that you do not end up settling for someone just because he loves you. After all, if your childhood was abusive/dysfunctional, you are more likely to quickly find someone much like your dad. For that reason, you must be very careful so that you can break that chain or it will be back-and-forth, off-and-on, etc. for the rest of your life. I wish you luck, sweets.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Do you have a boyfriend, or is this just a general goal?      You want someone to love you, and you want the security of feeling that there is someone warm and trustworthy always backing you up. It's no wonder you feel the lack of that, given your childhood.  However - people who walk around and who broadcast the level of neediness that you express, tend to find people who are in fact willing to commit to them very early on.  What's wrong with that, you say?  Well, the guys who want to marry you at the end of the second date are the controllers and the abusers, and because you are so needy, you are ripe for the pickings.      Please read, "The Gift of Fear".  It might help to teach you what to look out for.  Good luck, and hugs - with a lot of self-awareness and caution, you can have a good life - don't rush it!|`|bPaJXHw8aa	I m male 17. And im also alone. Can u be my girlfriend. I really in need of a girlfriend.I m very honest,handsome person. Mail me at-akash_halwai@yahoo.com  i m waiting for your positive reply.|`|08tdupUSaa	first of all you probably aren't legally allowed to get married where you live.    i'm really sorry about your childhood:(  but there's nothing wrong with wanting to get ingaged to early.  focus on your school and friends because there's plenty of time later for bfs and kisses and marriage.  believe me i know.  i'm 14 and would love to fast forward 10 and get married.  but right now just wait.  wait and just have fun.  because marriage is something you can't turn back from.  just enjoy life right now:)|`|ca83b6571e1307938cec4c3f9a53806aaa	i think your just looking for companionship and commitment because you've never felt that before. and being engaged would be a very strong commitment and it'd be love which is something you seem to be craving.  I think you need to learn to love yourself and you'll realize that your family does love you even your dad and you have friends that love you and you'll get over the engagement thing.|`|4cTPPOPyaa	Well, you really shouldn't rush it... You have to find the right guy for you..I suggest talking to your parents about dating, and go slowly..|`|hpy9JtfSaa	that is a very big step as you kno, maybe u want to get engaged to avoid your problems or prove your not affected by them. When u fall in love, like real love, u should leave it up to te guy to get down on one knee. but until then just stay in school and follow ur parents rules, if u stay on there good side, when tht day comes they'll be more appericative. getting married after you done being educated is a good idea tho. your not the only teenager who has big dreams, its totally normal! its ok.|`|9LGInLsYaa	I can relate.. im 15 and never had a bf or kiss ;p  Many people that dont get love from their family, friends, or were abused when they were a kid have an urge to be loved. In your case you want to be engaged so that you have a guy to love and care for you. But when u said that your not allowed to date probaly means that your family cares about you and is trying to protect you.  It can be a stage so hold on untill it passes  I'm sure in time you'll find that special person :)|`|ronomgTIaa	who is it that you want to be engaged to? I thought you dont have a boyfriend? I think you should see your school councelor for your problems.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Majority of  young relationships end really soon and bad. Only some lucky couples actually last. I suggest you rethink this. 5 years from now you could look back and see you made a HUGE mistake.|`|AA10652271	Maybe you just want to feel like someone  loves you. You will find the right person however it takes time. I wish you the best of luck.|`|FZRHIQHeaa	I would advise you to wait.  There's no rush, you still have your whole life ahead of you.  Embrace the love you recieve from your friends, and stay positive.  You're growing up too fast, SLOW DOWN!   If you do this too soon, you may end up regretting it.  It's best to wait until you know what you're doing.  Good luck! :]|`|UMg1CL7baa	There is somebody out there for everybody. My advice to you is, do the best you can now while your in highschool, go to a great college and then find somebody in college. Theres so many people you can choose from, im sure you will find somebody to love you. You dont want to get engaged too young though because marrige is a commitment for life. You need to be 100% sure, before making such a life changing decision. just wait, give it time.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	Umm.. i think you should be more social... go to the movies or somehing.... be out and about. and dont think of your self as not loved... i dont get along w/ my parents either but i know that its just part of being a teenager. and you cannot get engaged at such a young age... u have ur entire life to do that... establish urself b4 you take such a big step, be able to support yourself. I think the only reason you want to be engaged is to have a sence of belonging... if you have all these feelings traped inside you, write a diary or something... dont keep it in. i dont know what else to tell you... but plz do not get engaged... wait... it will be worth it. and im sorry for all that you have been through, but use it to ur advantage, dont let it make you weak... make it a reason to prove urself and work hard to make ur future very, very secure. i hope this helped|`|40qTdKuPaa	Dont get engaged untill you can prove you really like a guy. Dont worry you will get over these feelings. I hope this helps.|`|o67XytP2aa	ummmmm talk to ur parents or something or talk to a therapist or counselor|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Your life is already ruined, so you have nothing to worry about :)|`|2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	Try not to think about dating. Get yourself invovled in some activities. Sorry for what your going through. But anything you do will for sure turn into a mistake, so its best to wait. Just wing it baby!|`|SXS2Gf72aa	You don't really want to be engaged. You just want to be love/in a relationship. You're 16. You're not going to find a guy at this point in your life that'll seriously engaged himself to you.  And you ask how you can stop from making such a big mistake? ...you've never had a boyfriend! How could you make that mistake?
x8Rir2aOaa	well, this funny thing about girls (at least some) is that they don't like to make the first move. Yeah i know this leaves it up to the guy, but some girls like it that the guy makes the first move, showing that they(the guy) really wants to go out and cares.     It *sounds* like she likes you, and yeah, maybe she does want to play a bit hard-to-get, and wants you to make the first move.    The second "question"-- she might have nothing to say, or maybe she's debating telling you something important (like that she likes you), it could be various reasons, but that doesn't mean she DOESN"T like you. Don't wait for her to text back if a prolonged silence occurs, just text something that will spark the conversation up again.    Just remember this: you really don't know until you try!    So take the chance if you want, ooorrr you can let it slip by you while you sit on the sidelines, the choice is yours, my friend. :-)    Good Luck!    hope i helped!  GreenDay|`|fscgp7iFaa	You should talk more often if she likes talking that talk. She probably likes you if she's your friend they say Guys & Girls can't be just friends ask her out. Simple straight forward.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	she isnt texting u because she is making you work...kind of like hard to get.    she is trying to be mysterious in a way, like she is doing something else and cannot text u...she prob still likes u|`|hMavMBo4aa	Call her and see if she wants to hang out.  That's your only choice, if you want to get away from phone/text/myspace.  Maybe just call and leave a message.  Then the ball is in her court.  Is there a reason she might be intimidated by you?  Just don't seem to eager, because girls (humans, really) want what they cannot have.|`|XBfh6jphaa	well considering girls (all ages) love attention from a boy, especially one that they have previously liked, i'm sure she is waiting for you to text her at random times and message her & whatnot. you both have to play a part, it's not a one man game.  by saying that she was glad  you guys were talking again, shes implying she wants you to text her more often. if you give off the vibe that you really arent interested in talking to her, then she wont text you, because shes afraid of being needy or annoying. pick up the conversation again and start a new one. ask her questions and things that you can actually talk about and not just "hey" or "whats up"; "nothing" "oh cool".  hahah but yeah hope it helps :)|`|1GxMGmkqaa	it may be that she is just like you and dont text first cos shes afraid you dont wanna takl?   listen to your question-say it out loud so you can hear yourself. then answer it. mouth only 4 inches from ear and you gotta know how it sounds. think about it.  how do you really feel when you ask yourself the question?   and if you want to talk to her, then best you call her. test the waters so to speak and just be friends and maybe chit chat or agree to when you can meet and have a cuppa?|`|IDVFsy5waa	yeahh well that definitely sucks.|`|fMpKj0DYaa	She probably doesn't talk to you first because she is worried about the same thing.|`|5r48jn7iaa	well to your first question, maybe, but also maybe she doesn't want to be the first to start it cause shes a little shy.    and to your second question, maybe sometimes she doesn't get your last text. sometimes my boyfriend doesn't get one of my texts and later he asks me why i didn't reply.|`|9w8EW24daa	well all that matters is that she is into you and she does want to talk to you!|`|krkpHSOhaa	Yea im pretty sure she likes you.  She just wants you to show her more attention =D  But it is a little lame that she will just let the conversation stop instead of writing back|`|By1DJAUOaa	yur thinking to far and hard on and yur doubting yurself, you are exactly like i am when it comes to boys b/c i'll keep doubting he likes me but just keep talking to her and i know you fear getting yur heart broken but i see what yur talking about if she pushes it farther you do the same and stop doubting because she might break it off b/c yur doubting and she could possibly think he doesn't want to talk to me anymore, we are all going to have to be rejected once in life but yur just doubting yourself so STOP DOING THAT!!! If a guy wer doing this to me i wood get the idea he doesn't like me and break it off..|`|ycNt74yyaa	Encourage her to use her brain. Seriously, it's the only way she's going to fall for you and realize you are valuable.|`|tAYXUXreaa	Ok...no one likes it when someone plays games. I would say that if she is dropping the conversation that she is playing games. But so are you! If you want to talk to her, pick up the phone and talk! Also texts do not always go through, if you want a relationship, pick up the phone and talk to her. There is no reason to tell someone you like them, when you really do not. Most likely she really does like you!|`|fSwpE4ziaa	ask her dude, and the second one isn't a question|`|fMyIOOSdaa	well she might be waiting for you, alot of girls prefer the guy to make a move first, so start talking and talk alot more!!!    get to know her again, and THEN ask if she still likes u... if she says yes, kiss her or something =p|`|vvYt44h8aa	i think it is very possible that she likes you too!  you should seriously ask her though so that you can get it out in the open... the worst that could happen is that she doesn't like you anymore but you'll regret it if you never find out!|`|0QX6U31Zaa	it is very possible that she likes you and she could be feeling the same way you r so you should just go for it and ask her out|`|TtVk8S4aaa	i think she don't text you cause she maybe nervous|`|uzVMSVJpaa	yea, she probably thinks yu dnt wanan tlk to her, and she probably wont strt the convo first for the same reasons yu wont :P  my friend doe stht too, stops replying and thn blame sit on me D:  annoying right!?  LOL  there isnt reely a way to stop tht O___O|`|z2zZCJDRaa	Well it is possible that she feels the same way you do... and sometimes people's phones mess up and they don't receive text messages... I know mine does it all the time.|`|zPRU92ygaa	she totally digs u  but she's probably one of those shy people  you should so ask her out  she'll be like totally happy|`|UeFiMMFWaa	Maybe you just have to go up to her and tell her you do like her. It seems she likes you but doesn't know how to approach the situation. Maybe she is waiting for you to make the first move! :D  Maybe she doesn't like to text, and prefers to talk personally.|`|mnwN4QuRaa	UGH! Don't text so much. I did that with a friend and she got mad at me for not texting her and it was just that the text didn't go through. It is a dangerous way to have a total conversation. If you are friends it shouldn't be a big deal if you want to talk to her on myspace or facebook. Don't think of it as "omg, does she like me?!" Dont over analyze. Think of it as chatting with your friend.|`|BM4zJ2vZaa	Ok,She might not talk to you because she is waiting for you to talk. A lot of girls dont like waiting for the guys to talk to them and they want YOU to start the conversation. Also, sometimes just ask her do you like talking with me?  Hope I helped|`|5DwIRQOgaa	She might like you. theres no tellin. You need to stop letting her make the moves though! You have to start a conversation if you want to have a conversation! Once you get talking more, then maybe you'll know better if she likes you. Oh, and maybe she doesn't get the text you send. If she doesn't text you back, say, did you get that? or just resend it or something. if she still doesn't the second time, there's probably a different reason.|`|22PSjyM9aa	well i think if she is single and you guys are close, go out.    maybe she is waiting for you to make the first move. i normally wait for a guy to. just talk to her and be more confident. confidence is very attractive. as long as she enjoys you being there (which i think she does) the you should be fine with talking alot more.    just be sweet, nice, and funny and you'll be fine.      good luck! (:|`|bf7711519184031a4029ec03ac2717bfaa	im the same way... there are a lot of ppl like this so it is EXTREMELY possible that she is like that... and as for the whole liking each-other thing... she probably still does... i liked a dude and it turned out he still liked me for up to a yr or so after we spoke about it so we gave it a shot...|`|SzL9vUkSaa	Well, if she's showing any signs that she likes you : for example[ laughing with you, walking behind you or wanting to be next to you, staring at you, trying to talk to you, in anyway] start talking to her first, try to make her laugh, it always works when a guy does that to me. But if she looks like she's in a bad mood avoid her because the possibilities are she doesn't want to talk to anyone. Or just try to make her feel better.  My point is the guys have to start conversations, because she might be shy.  And if you really like her ask her out. The girl isn't the one who has to ask the guy, the guy has to ask the girl.|`|BHyYQX0Raa	ok well that's funny cuz all guys should know that they should be the man in the relationship and ask the girl out not the other way around or talk to her first, walk up to her and start conversations because guys are suppose to want girls more than girls are suppose to want guys! And evey time you see her online or have a chance to talk to her just do it because we only have one life to live so we should live it to the fullest. Im the type of girl that wants the guy to take the lead and be a man and not be shy or afraid of talking to a girl. Just say hi wats up or something to get the conversation going and if she doesn't reply then you will know 4 sure she doesn't want to talk to you! (i really want to be a therapist for these kind of things)|`|2yhK5ALgaa	you need to declare your love for her in a song. it must be sung outside her window at 3 am. good luck.|`|sAr3YV62aa	That is a possibility. If you really like her, try to muster up the courage to start a conversation with her. You may get somewhere. If you are uncomfortable with getting straight to the point, start with idle chit chat. Don't give up! Good luck! :)|`|ftFE7NKYaa	kay, you like her! SO tell her! maybe hang out a little more! just talk to her more and all that stuff.. girls like it when boys tell them they like them, that's when they tell you too, trust me!|`|eU14NaK2aa	A lot of girls prefer it when guys text first; as I've said in previous answers, we like playing hard-to-get. Even if she doesn't initiate the conversation, it doesn't mean she's not interested.
VcdmOXyqaa	Hey hun...my friends were like that too... my first kiss was this august and i had my first true boyfriend then (iwas 16 then and i am seventeen now)...and i am just now starting a relationship with someone new...it will happen just wait for it... id say be open for it but don't go running for it... its better if its with someone special...don't believe what they all say about it...it is special!!|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	ok, first boyfriend that actually counted? I was thirteen. First real kiss? I was thirteen. It was totally gross though, he shoved his tongue in my mouth.     anyway, I'm fourteen too, and seriously, It's just peer pressure. You having a boyfriend should be based on you having strong feelings for a guy, not the sake of having a boyfriend. My friends have been there, and you could see it, it was useless and there weren't any real feelings.|`|iwvRBeXOaa	Stop worrying so much about what rate "everyone else" is going at. There's absolutely no reason to rush having a boyfriend or rush having a first kiss. Relax! Let these things happen and progress naturally otherwise in a few years you're going to hit yourself for being so immature and stupid.    BTW, I was 14 years old when I got my first "real" boyfriend which only lasted a month and when I look back now a decade later I laugh at how much importance I put on relationships so young.|`|srfZDygNaa	summer of 9th grade bf, 8th grade kiss|`|Dx23osxWaa	My first boy friend was in 5th grade but my first kiss was in 7th grade and i was gooing "slow" how old r u n.e ways im 13|`|b4PU0YdEaa	6th grade, summer of 8th|`|EpJS1pjPaa	i'm 14 and haven't kissed nor gone out with a guy yet and I don't feel pressured into it just because everyone else around me is. I live my life for me, not others so i should do things when I feel its the right time.

Ok, just go up to a girl and make small talk. maybe ask her whats up or ask her if you can borrow a pen, for instance. you wont come off as creepy, and if they girl is freaked out by you, you'll know. Maybe make a small compliment? you'll come off as nice and after a while talking to you, they wont think your that intimidating anymore.     Whatever you do, please dont come off too strong. im a shy girl (well, in class I am) and my sister is kinda experiencing this guy that is coming off too strong, and she is really freaked out by him. he's basically a perv, and goes for almost every girl in my grade. he talks to her all the time, and she doesnt really know him. DONT follow the girl, and as long as you dont do that, you'll do great:)    Good luck!  -------------  as the girl who commented first, I DO NOT like bad boys, and im not sure if many girls do, or even why they do like them. its a turn off for me, but if your like that, then hey. Maybe other girls are too
iFOBRO79aa	Believe it or not us guys can sometimes be complicated.  You just have to flirt with us and try to get it out of use it will be clear if you send really strong signals to use it we like you or not.|`|a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...    *How to tell if he likes you  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).    A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.    Shy Guys  These are tough to crack sometimes...  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it    * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)    *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...    *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.    *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.    *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.    *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)    These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!    *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."    *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.    *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.    Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.    *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)    When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)    *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)    *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'    If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.    *He tells you that you smell nice...  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)    *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.

K2umerZ0aa	it depends how old u are and how much u know them, but probably yes....  :-)
StxOLqPuaa	Oh my gosh!!! This happens to me all of the time!! Just BE YOURSELF!!! That is the best you can!!! Alwayss try to make him laugh and sometimes you should seem a little sad and he will comfort you which will show him how much he cares about you and how much he likes you. Good Luckk!!!!
Y5ruAxuFaa	hmm tough choice!  i think i would stick with that lunch honestly. it gives you a chance to meet new people and net work.Don't let a boy control your decisions girl!
afWoScNbaa	It's all up to the person. Usually, the person really wouldn't care if there's hair. Some people just shave a bit so it doesn't look like the rain forest down there.|`|c1GimExEaa	dont shave its not that discus ting. but it all depends on the girl i guess,  and oral sex is when a girl sucks on your dick, or when you lick your girls vag,
h9z1DRUyaa	if he is that much of a jerk to like your best friend and he doesn't care, he's not worth it. you'll find someone better =)|`|d49ZA5xYaa	you have to get over him. its hard but theres nothing else you can do  you're best friend probably won't date him if she knows that you still like him though|`|fHALFeisaa	Well I think you should tell your friend how you feel and that you would have a problem with her dating him. Other than that, you can't make him like you, and if he doesn't then maybe hes just really stupid and not the right one

og3Tmn0saa	My friend had a crush on a senior when she was just a freshman. She was really bold and up front in asking him out. She was also persistent, and he eventually went out with her.  You might find it easier to find a way to meet him through your best friend's boyfriend. Maybe there's some party he will be at where you can bump into him?

e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	I think a great gift would be buying the most generic card you can find, and writing inside "I know this is the crappiest card I've ever gotten you, but at least it says "Happy Birthday" in it", and then put in an inside joke, for example, my one brother got my mom a cat birthday card where an eye fell out (which made it unintentionally funny), the inside joke used on my brother's card was "PS. I couldn't even find one with a one-eyed cat". As a result, that made it one of the funniest cards I'd ever seen. I think at 13, you're old enough to get irony and the unintentionally funny. That's my gift idea.    But if you don't know what else to get her, just slip some money into the card. Nothing big, just maybe $20 or so.
gYzEvFb1aa	I know exactly how you feel. However, reality is you need love in order to be happy and in order to have love, you need trust. Take it from me, not everyone will take advantage of the trust you give them, you just gotta watch out who you trust. Now I can't say you won't get hurt again because that would be a lie, but thats a part of life. You just gotta know how to get right back up and realize that people like that aren't worth your time so you have no reason to feel bad about how they did you wrong. So best of luck to you. Remember, you live and learn and as you learn you mature.|`|uo0DUadOaa	Not all of them are devious. Just give them a chance, and, for the love of God, try to pick ones who will love you for who you are.
g59U5kwUaa	im a 14 almost 15 year old gurl and im 5"4 i like guys that i can stare into there eyes and i dont have too step on my tip toes to kiss so your ok babe dont stress plus you still have years left to grow ;-d|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Yep I do. His name is Alex and he's a little MILFaholic.|`|QkKXX6igaa	my bf is your height, and i'm 5ft 9, everyone teases us, i don't mind, and he likes that i'm tall, it's hilarious when i wear heels, cause he can barely reach...things are a little awkward at times, but height doesn't matter so much, and he's ur age, and u could still grow...i think, idk, i keep growing, it sucks, i was shorter than him when we started going out and just grew...lol|`|K3oLisRBaa	lol itsz okay to b be short theres not anything wrong with that i have no problems with short guys i dont think any girls do its al bout personality nothing else matters|`|FaNrYZoTaa	that's fine....i mean you're probably gonna grow though if you're only 15  i don't like tall guys...cause idk usually they're too skinny and shlongy, i like em beefy and average|`|vR6AwIppaa	i'm a girl and i feel the same way, only i'm tall. i overheard a guy say "yeah she's pretty and funny and stuff, but i would NEVER date her because she's way too tall!" ='[   i have a lot of short friends that say that guys are too tall and they feel like a midget compared to tall guys, so you're in luck. the right girl is just around the corner. =]|`|W0hNoMSsaa	I am only 5' 2," and I have always felt more comfortable with short guys. A lot of times they are more sensitive, funnier, more energetic and less egotistical than the tall ones.  They're also a better fit in bed.     As long as you don't have "short guy complex" (overcompensating by being too loud, aggressive and show-offy), you will appeal to girls who like you as you are and who are not hung up on superficial appearances. You might have to look a little harder to find these girls, but it's worth it.     If a girl rejects you just because of your height, than she wasn't worth having anyway.  Good luck.|`|TVcvkC4baa	Hey dude, im only 4 and 11 inches. I would love to be at lest 5 feet. Of course girls will like you. Its on the inside that counts, too. So dont worry. BTW I AM A GIRL.|`|3sVc6Lptaa	yea i do, alot of hot guys are short i have always dated short guys except one guy he was a lil taller that me|`|cdsfJ5YFaa	Well, Im 19 and 5'3", so Im accustomed to dating short men. It really doesnt matter if a guy is short. Its the man. If you feel as if your a good guy, then go for any girl you like, even if she is 6 feet tall :)|`|2lMP6ow1aa	Yes. I am the same height. I prefer taller but the same height is just as fine. My friend being my ex is the same height as me and he is HOTTT|`|iFOBRO79aa	Find short girls.|`|kSlN7MjEaa	Just because you are a tad vertically challenged for a guy doesnt mean girls wont like you.  I am 5"10" and now I am married but I did go out with short guys if I liked them.  The sexiest guy I ever knew was about 5'6" his height didnt come into how I thought about him.  Have confidence in yourself and if you like a girl talk to her and ask her out.  Fortune favours the brave - so get out there and go for it!|`|AsNcyJZGaa	listen...  i'm a chick.  and i'm 6'5''  i am pretty much stuck with short guys and i have absolutly no problem with it.  what i can tell you is...  it wont be quite that easy. you probably wont get every girl you want, but what decent guy does? just learn that your self respect matters more than dating any sleeze that comes along, okay?|`|Yn3OOdP3aa	i would take you seriously.  just because your 5'5" doesn't mean girls won't date you, unless they are complete jerks.  i'm 5'4"|`|Rd1kFZFEaa	Ive always said that being taller was just one of those things I would look for in a guy but as it goes my first boyfriend is 5'5 and looks nothing like Id have ever imagined...he treats me like a princess and I have fallen head over heels for him... I didnt even notice his height anymore after about a minute of talking to him...to me hes perfect|`|h2hpowxZaa	I totally like short guys. And the fact that your their height doesn't make a difference, it might actually be a good thing. See, being their height, it doesn't make them worry if they're too short to kiss you and if they have to go on their toes and look stupid. So its more of a bonus than a negative thing. But some other girls I know do like really tall guys and muscular guys, but I don't really care. And most of the girls I know also don't care. The girls that do care usually have really bad personalities anyway or think they have to like a certain type of guy (big, muscular jocks, etc) because that was the idea they got from television or something. But it really does just depend on the girl. Short isn't necessarily a bad thing. It might even be cute in some peoples eyes. There are plenty of stars that are short and every girl loves them! Hope this helps :]
9yFdxmHwaa	Got a mouth? Talk.    Asking out a girl b4 you know her would get a lot of rejections. "Wanna go out with me?" works but it does not work more than "Hi. May I join you?".    Ask a girl out if you've talked to her a few times.     Know her. Ask her friends about her likes and dislikes. Surprise her with it.    On flirting - Be a joker. Don't overdo it. Say you're having a conversation about lunch. Cover it thoroughly. Then end with a joke "Did you notice teacher X dress? Was that banana pudding top?". Try to look serious when doing so. Making her laugh should be your goal.    Comment on her cloths. Make a joke on her appearance. Give her best friend a funny nickname and ask her to keep it your little secret. Don't be cruel with it, try to be funny. It shows that you notice her.    Say thanks to me if it works. If not, buy a dating book.|`|CsgJqo6Gaa	first of all....are u cute?  lol just be urself and flirt:D|`|fVomJGmKaa	haha, don't feel ashamed that you've only had one girlfriend. Just become her friend but while becoming her friend, I mean, be a little more, like flirt with her instead of just like talking to her. you know?    but good luck.
udQvs0kZaa	You don't LOVE either one if you have feelings for both. But go with the one that respects you the most and makes you feel loved and important. That is a necessary quality to have in a S.O.|`|fe2879005f528660584d6c591d71e1e9aa	ohh..datz hard|`|8WPGqtH8aa	3 SUM|`|GSH0d2vfaa	You dont. You obviosly dont like them that much to keep messing with both.|`|oMIxJTO1aa	You cant truly love 2 people, especially at the same time. You have infactuations or tihngs about both you like, i dont even know you or either of them and i know im right about that, love takes more time and can really only be givn to one person in the way your speaking...pick the one you feel that love..real love can truly blossom from. Best of Luck!|`|fiJwqH8Paa	make a list of good things and bad things about each guy and then choose what qualities you like best in them..that should help|`|sa84QWtKaa	well the first way is ask them how they feel about you if they say you like them fallow your heart.
TluWzYAJaa	don't want you to think that I'm not shootin' straight with you. The first use of the term cow-boy (it was originally hyphenated) was in England. In the 18th century it simply described a young boy who tended to the cows. The rough and tough adult cow-boy, however, does originate on American soil. But not where you might think.    Even at the time of the American Revolution, what is now the upscale New York City suburb of Westchester County was hardly part of the wide open spaces. It always had more crabgrass than sagebrush. And the only place it was ever west of was New England. But back then it was the home of many loyalists, or Tories, who sided with the British against the revolting colonists. Among the toughest were the guerilla fighters who signaled their attacks by ringing cowbells, from which they got the name cowboys.     So ya see, to be a "cowboy or cowgirl" has nothing to do with cows now  a days.  It is a spirit, way of life and a manner of living with the good old fashioned values instilled in the heart!  Eeee Haw!|`|K2umerZ0aa	hahah nice question! ;-)  i actually don't have an answer cuz i kinda wonder that 2! lol  hope u find the answer!!!! ;-D  lol  ...!|`|SzQKCeRqaa	They herd cows, so they are cowboys. Duhh.    thumbs up to HOW TO POOP AT WORK !!|`|A7r8xX7saa	Because they are ranchers and herd cows.|`|p8cUpUbNaa	Ohh nice question. email me the answer when you find it    thank you!|`|AA11098327	The horse is just one of the "tools" that cowboys and cowgirls use in the profession of taking care of cattle.  A cow can run a lot faster than you would think so they had to have something to ride that would allow the cowboy or cowgirl the ability to outrun and turn the cattle in the direction they wanted to go.  Just because you can ride a horse does not make you a cowboy or cowgirl.  The real definition of a "cowboy" is a guy whose job it is to take care of cattle.|`|71DWu22kaa	They round up cows and cattle.  That's why they are called that.|`|DJXuQqWJaa	they were called cowboys because they herded cows to different cities when train stations were jacking up their prices...learn your history..|`|K7FBbBSCaa	But the Herded cattle (Cows) that's how they get the name Cowboys and Cowgirls .|`|E9WFPlvVaa	well when the term was first used, its because they had to round up cows, sheeps, etc. all being part of the "cow" family so it stuck. =D

Like girls guys have that code too. Exspecially if you know their history!!! You need to tell him what you did and how you are feeling. If he is a smart guy he would get rid of you, because that is low! Hope this helps|`|AA11692897	dam dude, thats a realy dick move of you|`|tAYXUXreaa	It would be one thing if he was over her, but he isn't. If you are friends then you do not date his ex. She is also not a good person if she is willing to do this. I guess the real question is, is the sex better than your friendship of many years? There is no way that this will ever become more than sex. No girl wants to have a relationship with a guy who would sleep with his best friends ex. It is that simple.|`|08tdupUSaa	leave her alone  that's pretty selfish.  he'll get mad.  end it and never say anything about it again.|`|tAQOcfA8aa	obviously tell him  if he doesnt like what you did than you should stop seeing the girl|`|XohmRwiKaa	F him and get with the girl. Then F the girl again|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	all i know is that i wouldn't do that to a "best friend"|`|AA12359831	choosing a girl over a guy best friend? wow.  friends last longer. but if your willing to start drama then get with her. and maybe your friend will understand.|`|KuNEDHFzaa	Well, if he's still trippin over her than you should definitely feel bad for doing that to your best friend..but if you've been friends with him since 2nd grade I would definitely not waste that on a girl. I know it sounds weird coming from a girl, but friends come before relationships I think. But it's really your decision!|`|n4zATZ7Paa	Wow thats messed up what you did. Just leave her alone. Don't you know once one of your friends dates someone their off limits to you? You better hope he doesnt find out!|`|pbqgHOX9aa	Just think, putting your mouth where his privates were.... ewe|`|AhtaOu9aaa	tell him how you feel about her and ask if its okay...if its not.. respect him, and dont get witht he girl...if its okay ...then everything is cool...but if you REALLY like this girl and he says no but you feel that this relationship is actually real and special and worth risking your friendship...go for it...who knows she could be the ONE|`|0zW3gWfEaa	At this point, I would go and talk to your friend. Tell him how you feel, and ask him how he feels. Get things settled. Also, if it comes down to it, be prepared to choose between the girl and your friend. The best way to analyze who means more to you is the following situation:    Imagine they were both hanging from a cliff, and you can only save one. Think about it, and dont make a rash decision.
GalygHN8aa	For now just see where it goes. She sounds really nice and its not easy finding someone like that. Don't let her go unless your completely sure it wont work out. so let it run its course for a few more weeks and if it still isn't working then brake up with her.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	god, you men are so fickle.  she sounds great, but no connection..what is this connection crap anyway?  if you like being around her, then be around her and see what happens.  sometimes love grows after you get to know someone, and two weeks is not enough time.  she sounds like a keeper so don't bail yet!|`|IjpJanM0aa	Just stop now  before someones feelings get hurt worse|`|8HwwNUFxaa	would you risk your life to save her?? whats her feelings? ask yourself questions like that|`|7eZkEh2qaa	i think if your questioning it, your connection probably isnt all that strong and its really not fair of you to lead her on if you yourself arent convinced that its "meant to be". a little corny, yes. But you get what i mean right?    hope this helps a little.  
kERP7zAhaa	whats your last name?|`|AsUv3j4qaa	umm..and ur last name would b???? lol.|`|oE5fvOijaa	nothing
AA10604300	Jesus, Lord, please forgive my sins and save my soul from an eternity of tormentuous pain.
uRQEubkPaa	Well, if he get's really nervous.  finds any excuse to be near you  Makes extreme eye contact  Tries to be funny    If you notice any of this things, he probably likes you.|`|01yBLHvWaa	well it depends on the signals & how old you are.. im taking a guess your young because you said "boy" and not "man".. but what signs does he give off that confuse you?
HnEcgVGiaa	Seems like he is attracted by her inner-self, more than her outside. A lot of guys actually DO look at the inner characters of girls. Perhaps she makes him laugh, makes him comfortable, and are open with each other during conversations. If you want to stand out, just be yourself - with confidence. Make some jokes. Don't worry if they aren't funny. Girls in awkward positions are actually adorable/cute =] But most of all, be honest and true. And don't try so hard. Just let it go naturally.|`|nI6dyZCNaa	just wear a low cut top, booty shorts and smile when he looks at you.|`|YEjhx5Mvaa	just be yourself and if he likes you he will take interest in you|`|eoqTXCGxaa	ah get a life. ffs since when are people asking for support on the internet on stuff that you're supposed to learn on your own.|`|5yuhAHi1aa	Make the effort to talk to him, smile, look into his eyes or something.  Let him knoiw you're into him first.  Tell yourself that you wont stutter, hesitate or space out when you're talking to him.  Just be calm, be yourself and go with the flow.  Things will work out.    Good luck|`|ikkTcqPFaa	okaayy whenever you get answers contact me because i have the same freaking proble. I never know what to say whenever im around a guy i like|`|Pzp0pyNXaa	just be yourself ;|`|xuSHX9GLaa	dont even try to impress a guy because if you end up being with him youre gona have to keep pretending who youre not. and eventually that person will take over and your friends wont like it at all. your friends are the ones are gona be with you even after youre done with him..how old are you anyways??|`|L4eEuaanaa	Hey.  I'm not promising this will help, but try to act normal around him, like you do around your friend.  Make sure he meets the real you, and not some weird stammering idiot (no offense).  I really think that you should at least get to know him better, then maybe research something that you know he loves, and have a good conversation with him.    Let me know if that helps!|`|COmp4sIuaa	Not be speechless, show off your tna, and you should outshine your friend if what you say is true.|`|oe81XFO0aa	wow, that's a pretty harsh thing to say about your friend. Well, she's acting like a normal person, maybe that's the best route for you. As for things to talk about, maybe just talk normally about things that you have in common, maybe a teacher you both have or some kind of assignment. One thing you can never go wrong with is asking a person about themselves. People love to talk about themselves, maybe you can find some other things you didn't know about the person that you can talk about.....hmmm|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	ooo. that was a little mean don't you think?    maybe he's into her personality.  thinks she's more than normal.    if you want to stand out, have a personality that stands out.  you can't be shy and expect to get his attention.|`|y8wOnto7aa	just be yourself always.    and short shorts|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	It just goes to show you that personality is more important than pretty  just talk to him   he is not a God  he is not better than you     Nice things to say about your friend|`|VERrlErvaa	First of all, this is a 'friend' you're talking about.  Some kind of friend you are.    You make nasty remarks about her and all for the point of wanting to have something she has, that you don't.  Perhaps what you need is a personality replacement and a reality check.    Did you ever stop to think that you're not that boy's type of girl?  Just because she does not have whatever you seem to believe is the "perfect body" (that is, yourself);  doesn't mean that the two of them don't share far more in common.    Get on with your life and leave them alone.  And if you can't be nice about her - then I suggest you move on and cease your friendship.  Not that it's a very healthy one if you are being such a ***** about her.    As for the guy that wrote about "tna" - just shows what a jerk he is and what a user he is as well.|`|e9U7jO3Zaa	well just pull him over and talk to him|`|7hgs15aBaa	Boobs and Booty isn't all there is to a girl D|`|RdbnrFmraa	be sexy, rub up against him in the hallway and stuff|`|UW97kf4Baa	You should wear some makeup and just act like yourself. But if that doesn't work then you should find out what he likes in girls and then act like that. But i don't suggest that. OK good luck!|`|UxbjvAaRaa	first be yourself to stand out. show off to get his attention if you have to. another thing is to think of what to say before you go talk to him. sometimes guys pick out the weird ones. XDDDD hope this helped/ points?|`|gX40pgLyaa	At a school dance or club or something show off your dance moves when hes there. Crack some jokes aroun d him and just be outgoing!!!  Good luck=)|`|tBDVQlbjaa	if he has a thing for your friend....don't pursue it  you could ruin your friendship    don't be/dress like a slut...true that would get his attention but not in a way you would want    and did you know:  GUYS CAN LIKE GIRLS WHO DON'T HAVE BUTTS OR BOOBS  that's not excuse for why he doesn't like you  give your friend some credit for having a good personality...i'm sure that's why he likes her  there are guys out there that aren't into that stuff....and you should respect that and move on    i think you're just jealous because your friend is getting a guy and you're not    and i think it's kind of rude how you said "she's just fat....she's my friend though"  have some respect    sorry but that's just my opinion  you can say it's not true and i won't argue with you    i say be yourself  the end :)

4kbG608Baa	It is possible to fall in love at that age. Me and my boyfriend started dating when we were both 14 which was almost 2 years ago. We have still been dating ever since and I think it he is the love of my life. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, if you love him, thats all that matters.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	i think it is possible to fall in love at any ages. you know when its real or not but yes i think it is possible.|`|xFEuN9Vhaa	lust and experimentation.  That's all.|`|jItNwbpQaa	Sure you can fall in love when you're a teen. I think the concern is that because people change so quickly and so much into their 20s that early relationships very often don't last a lifetime. That doesn't mean it's not real love.|`|ooptWT4maa	I think its definately possible.  if you are mature enough to be in a serious relationship..   but when people are young, they like to feel free and crazy and often end up cheating which eventually ends the relationship. so if you are true to one another and are completely honest about who you are, it is for sure possible ;]  im 16 and ive been with my boyfriend over two years (:  i hope we last  =]]

ldzDqqUcaa	there is none we are equal|`|A8F4HF3Paa	There is no real 'dominant' sex in healthy male/female relationships.  Within individual relationships, sometimes one person can be dominant over another but sometimes it's the man and sometimes it's the woman. But those are individual relationships.  In general, and in healthy relationships, there is give and take and compromise with both parties so no one is specifically dominant over the other person.|`|Na2Wz5ipaa	sexist ppl will answer this|`|3lVuNfLMaa	It depends on the people.

If you believe that actions speak louder than words, then you have your answer.    However, watching so many men willingly bow to women's whims just to get in their pants, I can see why people would say women are the dominant ones.    How about this: Men are the dominant gender, but the vagina is the dominant genital.|`|hPDQGtdJaa	women|`|dWHSmESNaa	Men like to think they're the dominant ones...    ...but it's really us women. Guys are whipped, and usually too ashamed to admit it.    =D
AA10853815	I think the reasons women need men are    1. You cant live without them... NO MATTER WHAT it takes a man to have a child. without that "man" you would not exist.    2. Companionship... Not many people like to live alone without someone.  Most people want to be in love     3. To be wanted...  Many women want to be wanted. In fact many think they need to be wanted.  If some man doesn't love you or want you it can drive girls Absolutely insane.     4. To make a living... I know they say a women should be able to live without a man to support her and i totally agree with this, but if you like the finer things in life it would be nice to have a man to help you with your money    5. Love... I know this sounds repetitive but its not.  Everyone needs somebody to love and normally someone of the opposite sex is the preference.  I know i could not live without loving the man i love now.    I am sorry about what you have been surrounded by but not all men are like that.   There are some Truly beautiful decent men out there waiting for you! hope this helps a bit!|`|dJkNofnoaa	for me;  1. He makes me happy just by looking at me  2. The way he holds me close  3.

8szFciqnaa	The best chance to talk to him would be when it's just you and him in the hallway, but just remember......Guys are more intimidated and nervous, and this is coming from a guy so just remember that.|`|Yvn6uJC0aa	hes probably nervous too. try and get him alone to talk to him at frist. once you break the ice things will get easier and you wont be as nervous to talk to him in groups.|`|ykyOdlsJaa	It sounds like he feels the same way, I think you should find him alone, and talk to him then, it will ease your nerves and you should find it easier to talk. Once you do this, you'll realize how easy it is and you will start become closer, and closer, you get me? :)|`|VFOyzZJIaa	Do you guys use an instant messenger? Just add him and talk to him there, try and arrange a meeting spot away from his friends. Young love is a mystery isn't it?|`|pVFfCRmlaa	Ahh, you guys are only 13. My little brother's age ^-^   My advice is just not to stress about it, you're pretty young, as you get more experience with relationships you'll calm down, trust me.    But for now just think about what about him makes you so nervous. Maybe make a list of all the things about him that make you shake when you see him? I find list-making helps you to break things down and really think about it. If not, take advantage of the 'my friend has a crush on you' move that is still totally acceptable at your age.    Good luck :D|`|GQn5OC6baa	i no your thirteen. and it's called being prude. if you don't talk to him hes going to totally lose all interest. and once you do start talking to him you'll get in adrenaline rush and then you'll be fine. don't be afraid of his friends either they're probably jealous of him. if you do anything embarrassing he'll probably think it's cute. and if you guys do wind up dating make sure you talk because if you don't then your going to lose interest in him and he's going to lose interest in you.|`|amPxAZlJaa	ok well what u can do is if you really like him calm down, don't look straight at him if it helps, don't mumble either then it makes thing awkward...you know. try to talk to him when his people are not around i mean they cant be there all the time...relax deep breath smile and ask if you can talk to him privately...its ok to be nervous just try to be cool drink a bit of water before and go for it. ;)|`|tRoxSuMzaa	Hey there, its normal to be nervous its all about experiencin life. I think if u have his no.  u guys should sms, its easier that way to say wat u wana say plus u have more time with wat u wana say and u wont be embarassed or go red or be nervous. After a week of smsing i would tell him that u want to meet him sum where secluded without his friends, that way ul be alone and can talk face to face. Dont be too shy hold his hand and tell him how u feel and tell him its ok to be nervous. A kiss wud help too:)|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Write him a nice letter telling him how you feel,its always easier to write it than to say it in person...or get his email address and do it that way.being nervous at your age is very common,so don't sweat it.|`|XJqFqAnsaa	TRUE LOVE aww just talk to him i dont think he bites lol|`|qKtZXDQNaa	He is thinking the same exact thing like you trust me.  He is in the same situation as you are.  He is expecting you to talk to him more.  He wants you to make the move.    Trust me.|`|hRXGHnnNaa	hes probably nervous too... your in the same boat.... just text him if he has a phone, its alot easier to talk by texting.|`|OJrXDB12aa	Just relax first.. it's pretty obvious that you both like each other.. but just find a time when he's just hanging out by himself and just say "Hi" or "What's up?" The simple things like that can make a huge impression.. Good Luck :)|`|yCsR9fROaa	wow first of all just get calm and act like u do around all ya friends.the nervous issue has to stop obviously but this could take a while because u two don't Even talk to each other and the only way to get u both to become more comfortable around each other is to talk to one another and get to know each other. This is a sign that obviously u two have a definite thing With each other and that's great but to ask him out or get him to ask you out then u two HAVE to talk. Texting is great for these kind of situations but if u don't text then u hav to at least interact and stop pretending like u know one another. Be the courageous and have the guts to talk to him. If he won't make a move, u be the one to make it. Good Luck :)|`|7tLDdtqGaa	just talk to him. don't overthink it.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	I'm 16, but when I was 13  I  liked this girl who was like the guy you're talking about.

If you want jsut try and slip your number or a note to him, of have one of your friends do it so you can at least start communicating...or jsut grab him in the hall really quick and ask him to meet up with you after school, or somethign of that sort =]|`|yCjTBYAEaa	He's probably thinking the exact same thing you're thinking.  Just go and talk to him.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Does he have some sort of myspace page, or instant messenger maybe start talking to him that way at 1st, then once you have something to talk about (a topic of interest, something your both into, music, show, movie...) then talk to him in person too.. then the ice has been broken and maybe it won't be so hard on you.|`|Tu14TPPnaa	lol i totaly know what you mean! i get nervous too, i'm 14 by the way. if you know he likes you then just go up ans start saying hey hows it going or pretty much anything he wont care he will be flattered that you actually talked to him lol. trust me he's probably just as nervous or more nervous then you    and to prevent nervousness look at him and pretend he's your friend or family member that you are not nervous talking around. remember to smile:) guys love that|`|2uQOrBoraa	Get over your fears and practice like how you're gonna approach to him and how you're going to introduce yourself. This helps a lot and trust me, it will work. Just go for it!|`|xBxAD5NZaa	just take a deep breath and do what your soul tells you to do.|`|zWFsgPyMaa	share da love|`|IWvwnIHPaa	This is perfectly natural,  You're looking into all this too much.

kts8IEoUaa	I just stopped reading half way through your entry. Just don't be scared you're thirteen, you have plenty of time for nervousness else where in life. Just let him know what's up and be mature about it. Tell him your thoughts and how you feel, ask if he what thinks.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Just walk up and give him a little peck on his cheek in front of all his friends. That will score some points :) If, that is, you aren't too nervous heh. Or just try to talk to him, ask him about homework, lunch, or something ordinary, and slowly progress as you get to know him better.
INybXKozaa	As guilty as i feel for giving info to a virgin about sex,   your going to do it anyways so..    Honestly, yes, it hurts.  It is somewhat painful but take it slow.  You may feel awkward but you need to be in control for the first time  so that you can go at your own pace.  Eh, everyone is different but there shouldn't be that much blood.  Yeah most guys like it shaved, but some don't care,  so i would if i were you.  Good tips:  Loose it to someone meaningful.  (it will hurt you for the rest of your life if it's a jerk you loose it to)  Don't be afraid to speak up  (if your not comfortable, tell him)  Oral comes first or not at all  (that's just gross)    That's all i can think of right now.|`|yCsR9fROaa	There may be blood...if you have sex the wrong way. First of all u need to have a way to lube ur vagina or wherever he's going to be sticking his penis into. So, like the chick said before me, oral sex is definitely a FIRST!!! This stimulates the vagina and feels way better for u when he parks the car in the garage. (If u kno what i mean)|`|DeWADdQaaa	lol my first time was funny i couldn't stop laughing, we were both virgins and we didn't know any better. "wait which hole?" HAHAHAHAHA      good luck.
dKxJ2zDbaa	I was 15 when I first had sex with a boy my age who was shy but I had initiated it. He was extremely gentle with me. In my case it did not bleed nor was it hurtful because I had been playing with a dildo for quite a while before and along the way broke my hymen and some girls like it that way. I was not shaved then but I am now trimmed and not entirely shaved because when it grows it becomes itchy. Boys (and girls too - I am bi) like trim or shave better than full bush.Take your time and lots of time for your first. In my case my family was aware of it and left us the house for the weekend. In any case find a quiet place where you can be alone for at least a few hours. And do it on a bed not on a floor and still less in the backseat of a car. People might forget to tell you this but do it on a bed with lights on and take your time undressing each other and looking at each other's fully naked bodies. Pill and condom is a must. Foreplay too. Radhika.|`|77NzfiVkaa	It will hurt at first. It's different for everyone but it shouldn't hurt too bad. I just hope you are completely sure about this because once you've giving that away you can't get it back and you will never be able to give that special part of yourself to someone else who you might love more later in life. Just be completely sure.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	A couple things... first, good for you for being on the pill AND using a condom.  You are smart.  I also suggest that if you're a virgin, you go get the Gardasil vaccine for HPV before you ever have sex.  It will protect you from the four strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer.      When you have sex the first time, you might bleed a little (it's not even as much as you would bleed on your period, so that's not a big deal).  If your hymen is not in tact, you won't bleed at all.    As far as the pain, it's not really pain.  I would call it sort of a discomfort the first couple times.  If you use a lubricant like K-Y or Astroglide, it will be more comfortable and if you sort of control the rhythm by telling him how far in to go or how slow to go, that will also make it 'hurt less.'  Trust me though, no girl has ever had sex once, decided it hurt too much, and never had sex again. So that should tell you, it doesn't really hurt. Everyone likes it enough to do it again.    As far as shaving and all that.  Sure, do it if you want.  I wouldn't do the whole thing though because it itches like crazy when it grows back.  Different guys have different preferences about hair and shaving and everything but as long as you maintain good hygiene, most guys will just be stoked to be having sex.      The most important thing is just to relax and enjoy it. If you try the first time and it doesn't happen because it either is too uncomfortable or he goes soft or something, just chill and try again some other time.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	If you shave, it'll get all red and stubbly and ichy... but huge bush is kinda scary, short trim with scissors??? hahaaa yes, some blood, you probably won't like it too much until your 3rd time or so.|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	My first time did not hurt at all, I had no blood and I was not shaved and I used a condom and was on the pill.    Tips.  He should spend lots of time getting you worked up.  That's what made my experience better than most.  Don't expect to climax for your first few times.  If you do you are lucky.  Stress usually gets the best of you actually enjoying it.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	it will hurt a little just ask him to be gentle at first and go in slow strides...it will feel good after a few times. and every girl is different some dont bleed but if you do it will probably only be a little bit like a few spots. maybe more. but your not going to be gushing and leaking blood (eww sorry that sounded gross lol) and i would say yeah most guys like it shaved! it will be nicer for you if its shaved... heres a big important tip!!! FOREPLAY! lol it will make it better! good luck!|`|HhY4Oul2aa	ok really honestly im not going to lie it really hurts the first time, make sure he dosnt just shove it in you because that will really really really hurt, like my bf did it very slow and a little at a time by slowly getting farther and farther by thrusting slowly and gently and stuff and also you must tell him that if you say stop he better stop because honestly it really does hurt alot, but some other tips i can give you is t not be to tense because it will hurt a hella lot more if you are, because i  was very tense when i first did it, and also how old are you? and abot shaveing, it all depeneds on the guy personally the guy better be well trimmed but i dont like it when a guy i completly bald like a babies but it to...baby like and not man like. Also something u really want to make sure you want to fdo before you are have sex you have to foreplay, have him finger you and have him arouse you it will feel much better, i was so nervous that at fist i wasnt wet at all and therefore it hurt alot more, i will tell you thins it took about 3 times to get it completly in, i mean the penis all the way in and then a couple of time later to stop hurting after the first time your vagina will feel bruised and sore and swollen, also i will also warn you that afterwards your relationship will be extremly differnt like....you will feel dirty you will feel less innocent and just overall differnt    goodluck and make sure you are absoltly sure you are ready|`|ddP3klT3aa	I would shave. It might hurt, it might not. I didn't bleed my first time. It will take time to get used to it. It will take many times for it to be painless. Just give it time. It will feel better later. Just make sure he is the right guy and not just using you.|`|xSWUwlEiaa	people wouldnt have sex if it hurt  no blood unless you on your period (in which case you shouldnt be *******)  yea its good shaved. (or a quality trim)|`|AA10962298	Don't shave. A nice trim will do. Yes it will hurt briefly, but if he takes it slow and makes sure you are ready you will be okay. Usually very little or no blood.

Some guys on Yahoo won't be of mush help but don't listen to their sarcasms. I think that Christine and Radhika are giving you very good advice. Make sure you don't have unsafe sex. That is the most important thing. Christine has good advice on that. As for the how to do it I think Radhika was a very lucky girl to have the house all by herself for a whole weekend thanks to her parents' understanding. Not every girl has that chance to have such understanding parents. If you do talk about it you could be lucky as Radhika was. But the bits about the bed and not the backseat of a car and about taking your time to undress and look at each other's bodies that is great advice. I never thought about the dildo to open up the way but you could think about it. I had used a dildo before my first and thus breaking the hymen but then I had not done it on purpose but it might be good advice. Trim is best for the reasons given. Enjoy and make sure you have plenty of time a bed and privacy.|`|vDu90qajaa	u are stupid|`|eeO6Xjquaa	I know this will sound old fashion, but Lily, you should be comfortable enough to talk to your mother about this...

MYFw9f9daa	You do it by breaking up with her, saying that it's over for good, and then sticking to it.  It's tough, but what sucks more then that is dragging things on if your not feeling it.|`|QGxQrDTJaa	Tell her you don't think it would be fair to her if you stayed in the relationship knowing it's not going anywhere. As a girl I think that's why I get most upset when things end...I think about the time I've lost.|`|m3iPgBWFaa	Just say this isnt working and it never will    GOODBYE|`|Ujb6P4gMaa	Say that you just want to be friends.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	Do you want a 'good' or 'bad' break up?    The good one is to tell her that you want to break up and that it is definitely over.  Chances are that she will respect your decision and you both move on and maybe even remain friends.    The bad break up is too sleep with someone else and make sure that she either catches you or finds out.  This way leads to bloodshed and tears but it will definitely be final.    Your choice.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Last year, I broke up with my bf of 3 1/2 years and had to figure out a way to tell him. I'd been thinking about doing it for a while and wanted to make sure I was certain that I wanted to quit the relationship before I told him.  Basically, I just told him that we needed to talk and straight out said that I've known for a while that I wasn't happy and that I"d put everything I could into the relationship and it wasn't working.  You don't need to explain every detail of why or why not.  If this is what you feel is best, then it's what you feel is best.  She's probably going to be hurt no matter how you say it, but she'll eventually be okay after she accepts it.  Breaking up is not going to be easy and there is no method that's the least hurtful (the best thing you can do is be as honest as possible with her and as sensitive as you can of her feelings).  Good luck.|`|qajX3kzPaa	tell her you just don't feel the same towards her   and you want to live your life|`|Swxir2ieaa	Tell her that you just dont feel the same about your guys relationship anymore and that you think its time that you go your separate ways.|`|n3Mk3cvCaa	Sorry, but It's over, I just don't love you anymore, we can still be friends if you want.|`|sZePlWTQaa	End it and stop talking to her.

GHZnLiYvaa	Well, he is just a little immature and hasn't realized what love is actually. But at the same time he's honest enough to admit that he hasn't fallen for you yet. So you have no reasons to worry. But make sure you don't give in to him completely and get yourself hurt later. I hope you understand what I mean.Give it some time and let his strong feelings turn into love completely.

In my experience, the best way to find out what a guy is thinking is to be up front with him - sounds cliche but honesty really is the best policy!  However, beware because it could either go extremely well or extremely badly...   Personally I tend to agree with your friends. Sounds to me like the guy is very confused! But honestly, it's no good asking people who know nothing about him or you what he's thinking - he's the only one that knows for sure!    Good luck!|`|m8ZXGqqPaa	He seems to be going through something...give him time let him figure out what he needs.    If hes worth it, just be patient...its only been a month?

DIg8i6qQaa	okay, honestly? don't you watn someone your own age? i'm not saying that there's anything wrong with that but he was obviously a jerk if he was trying to prokoke you by saying things like that. my advice is just to say hi when you see him, don't let him intimidate you.
UAFwfWv0aa	well that's  rather convenient for a LD relationship because you can see her often. In any case, be careful.  think about what kind of relationship u have and want to have with this person (in a realistic way).  if u don't see much potential in your relationship after thinking about it.  then just go ur separate ways and go on with your life.     LD relationships are not for everyone.  my current b/f is 2,000 miles away from me and i won't see him until aug. so in our case, we can't see each other physically and communication is key to keeping things alive.  And sometimes i feel like i can't take it.  but we trust each other and have demonstrated honesty.  we have plans for moving in together when he finishes his career training, so it makes a difference to want to try.  we almost broke up that last time he went away, but talked it over and figured out it was a misunderstanding.     i attempted a LD relationship with my ex back in the day and we didn't even last a month.   so it really depends on ur compatibility with ur partner and ur future outlook.      Good Luck.|`|sZePlWTQaa	30minutes?? Thats it??

At this point he just misses her attention and wants what he can't have. Tell her to stand up for herself, there are plenty of men out there for her to start fresh with.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	How to tell if she likes you:    *She gazes in your eyes with deep interest and her pupils are dilated.    *Her skin tone becomes red while being around you.    *Her crossed leg is pointed towards you or if that same leg is rocking back and forth towards you.    *She raises or lowers the volume of her voice to match yours.    *She rubs her chin or touches her cheek. This indicates that she's thinking about you and her relating in some way...    *She winks at you while talking to you or winks at you from a distance.    *She exposes the palms of her hand facing you.    *Biting of the lips or showing of the tongue, licking her lips or touching of her front teeth....    *She starts sitting straight up and her muscles appear to be firm.    *She puts her fingernail between her teeth.    *She laughs in unison with you.    *She touches your arm, shoulder, thigh, or hand while talking to you.    *Plays with her jewelry, especially with stroking and pulling motions.    *She twirls her hair around her fingers while she is looking at you.    *Eyebrows raised and then lowered, then a smile usually indicates interest in you.    *While talking to you, she rests an elbow in the palm of one hand, while holding out her other hand, palm up.    *In a crowd she speaks only to you and focuses all of her undivided attention on you.    *While talking to you, she blinks more than usual, fluttering her eyelashes.    *Big smiles with upper and lower teeth showing with a relaxed face.    *She speeds up or slows down her speaking to match yours.    *She rubs her wrists up and down.    Thats pretty much it...

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|OZuAh3B9aa	If she keeps on staring at you... if you think so start alking to her if you have any classes together|`|45lUwgAmaa	coming from a girl when i like a guy, i like smile at them, act award when i see them and i laugh when i pass by then|`|b4PU0YdEaa	When she's shy and looks @ u (a lot)|`|riN3cYIKaa	if they hang aruond.......and look at you ........seem to laugh and giggle alot|`|zH80yyDQaa	1.

If you wanted to you could put oatmeal cookies beneath the sugar cookies (I don't think oatmeal cookies taste very good with decorative icing and sprinkles).    If you're not all that great in the kitchen you can always go to a local bakery and ask them to make and decorate the cookies for you.     Put them all in a decorative Valentine's day tin and you're all set.

vnJG8UYJaa	All of life's experiences changes our personality as we grow up.  It sounds like you have made a concious decision to try to become more outgoing.  Maybe you feel mean because you know of other people who are outgoing and mean at the same time.    Outgoing people can be friendly, funny, supportive, encouraging and happy.  If you were being mean, I thinks somebody would step up and tell you that.  You would probably be getting some feedback.      Maybe you feel mean because you had the guts to break up with the not so great bf.  I say, kudos to you for taking care of yourself!  Pat yourself on the back and let your confidence grow.

You can give him a hand job while making out.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	when you make out touch eachother, or try going super fast then go super slow and make him want you. XD
LMRaSXFeaa	he probably didnt grow up with affectionate parents. dont be scared to start the hugs and kisses, if you want affection you have to go and get it. and im sure he'll like it better if you make the first move. :]|`|WCkaZ4N7aa	some guys are just like that. they feel scared that u will get mad and dump them if they do something wrong. you should try to talk to him about how you feel. if something feels wrong talk to him. it is way better then bottling up you feelings. another reason might be that he never has been treated affectionately before you.  the fact that he gives you hugs and such means he obviously likes you. plus when he looks at you his face lights up. just if talking to him doesn't work, live with it.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	some people are like that.  Just live with it|`|HNTOkgdhaa	you gotta tell him or drop hints|`|b3AUCeqaaa	JUST TELL HIM WAT U FEEL
40qTdKuPaa	Guys do this all the time. They take a little break, just to annoy you. Dont worry he likes you! And you can always text him too you know!!! hoipe this hels|`|4xzl9wGDaa	Forget him he has someone else and playing games with you.|`|ihSvdnOvaa	Because he hates you for being so annoying and he just told you that he liked you because he's not man enough to tell you the truth. forget about him.|`|SX8z9Zg0aa	I think you are reading into it way too much.  Most likely it is making you look desperate and that is turning him off.  I would suggest you chill out a little bit.|`|LJxKNAdVaa	he just nervous cuz he probably REALLY likes you|`|GNGw5MItaa	from what i can tell, he's scared... he probably thought you said it but didn't mean it as "liking him"... so now he's nervously waiting to see if you are freaked out by him returning the compliment... i know this thanks to my stupidity by doing potentiality he same thing... lol|`|H2Ao99Zlaa	he didnt want to hurt your feelings but he doesnt really like you?.. idk guys are confusing|`|yngXCPjEaa	He probably is really nervous that you know he likes you.  Maybe you should try to talk to him in person.|`|1drXUvLiaa	Once he knew you liked him he knew he could have you and that made you no longer appealing...boys like the chase and once they achieve what they want they are ready to move on.|`|AABCy5mQaa	Hes probably just nervous now that you guys let the cat out the bag. He probably doesnt know how to proceed so hes trying to let you make the first move so he doesnt do the wrong thing. When two people are friends and suddenly liking each other , it changes things a bit, and he probably doesnt know where to go from there. Take control of the situation and dont be afraid to ask him how he feels. You dont have to be shy and discrete. Guys like aggressive girls who take control.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	He probably feels really awkward.  He may be waiting for you to talk to him first.|`|caArlzCvaa	lol he probably feels shy and nervous. text him back and tell him wuts up :]|`|oFzCgCrfaa	Do you go to the same school, if you do then talk to him every once in a while. Sometimes guys dont know that girls want them to talk to them

But what ever you do is don't stop showing your interest that will just tell her you are not interested.|`|OoihsiN0aa	okay well girls dont think guys are that complicated. because when it comes to girls they are usually clueless no offense.

Honestly, we like men to show a little interest in us, but not to be obsessed or overly needy of our attention.|`|90qBWGmJaa	Uhhh...not me!  I like the oposite, when they show you you like them.

Drop all the silly thinking out of it.|`|oc0pCUhyaa	no way the treat em mean, keep em keen thing is soooo over rated and never works- this is only going to get the girl to think you are an as* hole and not worth her time. try and become mutual friends with no pressure for anything...then you might change your mind and at the very least you have a new friends and friends last forever...unlike a fling. or on the other hand she might  fall for you....girls are much more comfortable with bf's that were formerely besties....  g-luck xxx|`|IDVFsy5waa	do NOT ignore her, that will make her think that you have no interest in her. just smile & talk to her!|`|jmvTARG4aa	play hard to get?|`|U0U4qRK7aa	just talk to her and be UBER UBER sweet  like so nice it almost hurts  go OUT OF YOUR WAY for her.|`|tAQOcfA8aa	give her your attention  make her laugh and talk to her about what sports you do and stuff   but do NOT act like a jerk, that will just totally turn her off|`|BBws5hl7aa	hey heres a secret:  go in the bathroom look in the mirror  oh....sorrry but ya gotta be hot...  if you are theres nothing to worry about.|`|QiMdroGbaa	Be nice and just talk|`|47jMXUkkaa	no just be yourself and she will start to notice u more|`|mE0MY4nGaa	you cant just make her interested without doing anything. if you show her you are interested and talk to her, as she gets to know you, she may start to like you  thats your best shot|`|AeRg0XwJaa	NO.

I've never smelt anything like that before! I love it!"    Just be different!|`|JeuRo9Nlaa	Girls like you to talk about about them GOOD THINGS. Girls don't like you looking at other girls AT ALL. Take them shopping ( at the mall ) and going to a dinner (romantic dinner.) They like you to walk them to class. They like you to carry there books to there class too. Say nice thing like your hair is all some today or love what your wearing today.|`|OYOZN3QHaa	tell her how you feel|`|1drXUvLiaa	Give her a strip tease and show her the six pack :P|`|3yB5TfL7aa	no you cant to nothing!!   depends how close you are now, you maybe putting to uch presure on maybe she dont like you that much|`|lZxefAgDaa	id say try to make sure you show her you care first, this way she knows shes special. then, if she doesnt show interest or doesnt care after that, thats when you can pretend to not really care about her, so she gets the message that you dont need her and will be perfectly fine with the other fish in the sea. that way, shell be like wow i better go for this guy before he doesnt want me anymore! lol|`|NfFXo1uFaa	I would actually like to know that answer.  It's like asking what does peanutbutter taste like without tasting it.|`|ChwJWjQSaa	no.  that just makes us mad. try saying hi. try having a conversation if she sits anywhere near you. ask a question on something you don't understand but she does. get to know her. we girls usually like to know SOMETHING about a guy before we date him. ignoring her will just make her think you really don't have an interest. on valentine's day, give her a valentine that's a bit nicer than the others you give out, but not too much nicer.|`|zrfxZE1Iaa	I no that coming from a girl, if she likes you and you show that ur not interested, it will drive her nuts, that's if she likes you. You can't exactly make her show more interest, but just keep talking to her, invite her to do something with you, for sure get to know her better. See what happens. If she really does like you, she also might not even show interest just to make you jely. We can be very tricky :P

2vYI7UYhaa	wow. that's sad. i am 13. i really don't no wat 2 tell u. umm... you should try really telling them how you feel, don't back down. not until u get some of the freedom u deserve. stand tall, and have a "lecture" memorized. tell them how u hate who u date, and how its time u should get to choose things, talk to guys, go to the movies and mall. like i said, the most important thing is not to back down. ask urself, wats the worst that could happen? i hope i helped a little. and i no wat u mean kinda. im not allowed to talk to guys, and my mom reads my diary and journals, and everything. but, good luck! i have faith in you!|`|NQwljNOoaa	The teen years are so very awkward.  All teens feel that they are mistreated by their parents in some way or another.  I am not saying this to lecture you, I am saying this to tell you that your feelings are perfectly normal.  Teenage years are tough because you are in that in-between stage where you are too old to play with toys like you did as a child, and yet you are too young to do what seasoned adults do.  You are seeking out your independance and some parents have trouble recognizing that their child is not a child anymore.  Some will try to do things (like what you are describing) in an attempt to keep their child from growing up so fast.  You sound like a very smart person.  My best advice is to be patient with your parents.  It's ok to gently remind them that you are not a child any more, but don't do it when you are angry,.  Try talking with your mother.  Ask her to tell you about her teenage years (that will get the ball rolling to remind her how she felt at your age) and ask her how long it took for her mother to not look at her and see her as a child.  Tell her that you need her support and that you understand that you will need to compromise (like allowing you to go to the movies with your friends and you will come home when she tells you). Try talking to your parents separately and get them to talk about their teen experiences and then say something like "that's how I feel now" when they tell you about their parents treating them like a child.  They will eventually get over it. It will just take a lot of patience on your part and a little time for them to get used to the fact that you are your own person now.  Good Luck!!|`|DeWADdQaaa	when you turn 16 emancipate yourself, then the state you live in will declare you an adult and you can move on, just make sure you can support yourself.     good luck and i empathize with you.|`|w0ZGxfJJaa	Ok, soooooo. Try to go live with a aunt or uncle. Or when you turn 18, move away, ASAP. Or, write your parents a letter telling them this and move in with your BFF (inless they are making you be BFF's with someone you don't like!) Or go to court for extreme control or something like that. Try telling them your not there little baby anymore, your ___ for pete's sake! (__ = how old you are) You deserve you own freedom, them can go to court for this, your not kidding. And scream!
JnXmSLDfaa	I agree you should spend more time in your room doing things you like it helps with the aggravation of going out there and being subjected to annoyances of your family. I wish i also could go outside more but it seems pretty pointless when i think that i have nobody to go out with i would love to go out with my friends but my best one lives so far away that all we can do is play online together and its really a blast when we get to, I never have that much fun in my whole day except when i get to play with him but like you i dont get out much so i don't really have anything else to do but games are much more fun anyways so pick one up Age of Conan or WoW.     My Mom isn't like yours (Controlling) so i can't really comment on that but she is trying to do what she thinks is best but sometimes most of them don't even know what is and end up failing. Also try building toy models of things like Lego's those are really really fun and they help your lack of Social life   . Social life doesn't really matter to me but it does alot to some people i love games so i just talk to people on there while i play with them and do quests and work together and such. Moms do get annoying and you try not to get mad but it just comes out so make sure not to yell at your mom or get mad at her just try to understand that she is trying to make your life smooth and trys to guide you in the right direction. Or wait till your 18 and move out no rules and you can talk to everyone and do anything you want without someone nagging at your ear telling you what to do. Well i hope i helped  (Somewhat) goodluck and try not to get mad at your mom you will regret it when you are older just wait till you get in the teens like me your going to have a heck of a time controlling your emotions but you have to realize  what you are doing and learn from your mistakes.|`|YmgDYfbvaa	go for a walk and look around your neighbourhood.    look for other people and just talk tot them. make some freinds  find a hobby or find something to spend some time on, something that you like doing. if you like....cars you could rebuild a car, if your into....ponies then you could go and find someone with ponies and offer some help out. you need to get out of the house and away from the stressed out people. organise something with ur freinds from myspace im sure theres something you could all do.  i hope this helps|`|5r48jn7iaa	don't pay attention to they're crap. find things that make you happy. listen to your favorite songs, just relax in your room. (i love being alone in my room) find a hobbie..like my sister loves to make scrapbooks. find a sport you can make lots of friends like that. umm don't be in such a rush to come home from school, so things with friends after school, or stay after for help...or you can even talk to your teachers. when i have a bad day i go sit and talk with my old teacher. have sleepovers at a friends house. or even sit your parents down and talk to them and try to plan a day where they just drop everything and hang out with you. but don't run away. 1: you would get in so much trouble and 2: i know your family is like this now, but when its all said and done family is all you ever truly got and will always be there for you. just hang in there, things will get better.
5FCiKNaGaa	i think its a personal prefrence, but did he seem to like it?
4ME3vNTbaa	My man calls me this all the time. But I know it personally turns him on because I literally give him no indication of my "freakiness  " in public. Its better to be a "freak in the sheets, but a lady in the streets." If you are loose all the time, you may want to rethink about what he really means
AA12359831	SHALLOW. thats why they dont like you :P
sJTPzFdlaa	Ok, first off, stop getting ur mate to ask him. thats immature. If you want to find out, ask him urself. And keep in mind that u broke up for a reason. Maybe you just need to move on and find someone else.

AA12225439	move b4 he starts the divorce because then you will have to stay until it is over. the same thing happened to my sister and she did move out of state with her son and when the divorce started he had to go to the  state she was in.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	First its not likely he will get full custody unless you've been deemed unfit. Especially since he's active duty...judges have to have a really good reason to remove a child from a mothers custody.  Second, IF he were to take your child out of state without a custody agreement in place it would be considered kidnapping and you could contact the police.  I would file for divorce first, request full custody due to his active duty status, and allow him visitation. Don't let him step on you - you have as many rights to the child (if not more being his mother)|`|5k7BexD3aa	You need to talk with an attorney.  Just because YOU have a job offer doesn't mean that you can move the child away from his Dad.  The Dad shouldn't have to pay extra for visitation because YOU choose to move.  You may have to pay 1/2 of all travel costs and etc..    Let him file and then kick you out.  That should give you more leverage to move back home (if you are going to family)|`|MVxFOI5naa	Well given the fact that he is being a bastardo I would say yes -you will need a place to live and if he takes you to court about it tell the judge he told you he was kicking you out of his house !(that will look real good for him)|`|TQHHH7kxaa	if you feel threatened by him or safety of your son then do so .but if you,re vengefull.just deal with it.
joA5Rcyzaa	yeah i wouldn't mind    helps choose our preference    that way you'll know he'll like it|`|CEqYjcBeaa	It's a good idea to ask him, but if you are trying to surprise him for V-day then I would have to say no. It would ruin the surprise and thrill of it all...well not all of it, but you get what I mean.
fE5bC83Saa	hi,  indeed, appreciation is what every woman seeks.  as off my experience with my girl friend ,  saying" with or without you",hurts more than any thing in life.  so don't put it this way.  i know why you need to do this ,and that you will do it any way.as much as your boyfriend probably does also.  but you can imply it,saying:   i tried my best here ,and its not working, it would be great if you consider moving out with me.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Yes, if he loves you he will find a way to continue to see you!|`|VcrDOsFKaa	you have the right to happiness......tell him u r moving and he will either have to put up or get lost....    its high time he realise u.....
K5IOSGXAaa	Ah yes, peer pressure. Just tell those losers exactly that, they are losers and you are just fine the way you are, thank you very much. As for the girls, yes I agree with you, there is nothing uglier than a drunk, high stupid girl. Same advice, dump them out of your life, they are skanks. There are plenty more people at your school, just get to know other guys and girls. Keep up your positive outlook and lifestyle. You will find others who are not into all that garbage.|`|uRQEubkPaa	Yes, everything will change in college.|`|nvQ4WtcBaa	they obviously have in there head that bunin the weed is kl it's not. you will do well in the future just live your life init|`|xpiGWrdMaa	no. nothing will change. i know people in their 40's that still smoke weed. and if you're a musician, good luck staying away from that.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	yep, go to college, or university. you'll find the girls are more mature.    be true to yourself.|`|1gf0BwcXaa	the girls, it's their instinct to do this in HS, 'cause they think it's cool. even if they see all the health vids about smoking, some will probably still smoke weed. and you don't get into all the pressure on "just to try it." and it WILL change after HS. during college, they'll eventually mature.
89cCKrm8aa	what makes a guy feel brotherly to a girl is when, he can help her do stuff, and teach her things. he can defend you when your getting picked on, and he knows how to make you feel better when your sad.|`|O9jrkjgraa	When you have a close friendship.
wscyjkPAaa	I think its ok for  a guy to have a good friend who is a girl as long as he knows his boundaries.  For example:  no going out on "dates" alone together, not getting into situations where one gets tempted, and basically treating his friend like a friend, meaning however he treats his other friends should be the way he treats his female friend.  He and his female friend should understand that he has a girlfriend and they should not do anything to disrespect the relationship.  I don't think it's because theyre not happy in a relationship or being stupid.  I don't think it has anything to do with that.|`|c4BPvxz9aa	i think that if he is flirting with you it is because he likes u and not his gf|`|QFrSxzQJaa	What "things" are you talking about? What you see as inappropriate maybe well be appropriate to someone else. If you think its inappropriate then you should confront your guy friend about it.|`|XZSp2ORPaa	Its ok for a guy to have a girl for a friend, but if theres a girlfriend inthe pic, then hanging on them (friend) kissing all the things you do with the girlfriend shouldnt be dun with the friend, you gota draw the line somewhere. If your uncomfortable with it let him know. If he treats her better (friend) let him know. Be honest but not jealous. Girls will come and go but good friends stay forever!!|`|U22nd6Aaaa	Depends on what he's doing. If he's very openly hitting on you then that's wrong and he should respect you and his girlfriend more.    Sometimes people are really open and playful with their friends. I've had close female friends who have thought I was flirting with them when all I was doing was being myself.|`|IN1X1CVGaa	flirting is...okay  but if its too much then its not good  and lying isnt good either    i think most guys do this  cause their scared of commitment  and their horn dogs!|`|3dWxPIlQaa	If he's staring at other girls legs.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Stupid|`|G4HVf7f3aa	Hopefully just being stupid. Inappropriate would be, in my opinion, kissing, fondling and anything else "worse" than that.|`|oyvRHQmaaa	Depends on what the "things" are, and whether he did them before he got a GF.....    If he always kisses you, when he sees you.. it's not inappropriate...    If he started kissing you after he got the GF... it probably is.....
fLj7ynSjaa	i think hes afraid of getting rejected because he thinks you dont like him back
JfVxCDb7aa	I flirt like an expert myself...............  1) she's interested and is flirting.  2) teasing or flirting  3) flirting and interested  4) definetely interested, unless it's overwhelming ,lol, then maybe it's a gag or something.  5) neither--means nothing, probably not interested in fact. Or nervous and interested.  6) can't be sure w/o knowing her better  7) can't tell--probably   teasing  8) teasing|`|WQOC6ILMaa	We are kind of dumb. I'll be honest if a girl does any of those things I might begin to think that she is flirting. I usually wait for several cues though.|`|uz0R5pjHaa	Yah, I know guys are kinda dumb but when it comes to this kinda stuff but yah we do notice it.|`|5oj5YfKMaa	My experience with this is that the girl gives two or more of the signs mentioned above but then it's like they think in there head "Yeah, I can get him!" and become rapidly uninterested if you even give them an inkling that you are catching there flirts. It's cruel if the woman has no interest other then to just tease.
OCMSTxYfaa	make her a scrap book of pictures of her kids..my mom loved it|`|NWvYLRPnaa	maybe a mother card and a big hug?<br>  going out for dinner?|`|N4X8VSUvaa	If you and your brother and sister can get a picture taken without her knowing it that would probably be a great surprise.  I am sure she would love to brag a little on her kids. And you can make a frame for it use your imaginations.  If you get flowers and balloons take them to her job. Plan to take her to lunch or bring her a special lunch at her assigned time. If that would be permitted.  Usually deliveries can be made to the hospital.  If she gardens make up a basket with gloves, seeds,a flower pot, those garden clogs, and little tools from the dollar store, Put in a book on perennials or vegetable gardens. Get some old photos of you all and make a collage type frame.  You could get a plain big shirt and decorate it with a garden angel and appliques from a craft store.  They can be ironed on and you can even put photos on clothes like a your kids love ya Happy Birthday shirt,|`|jccJI9liaa	Well you could make her lunch or dinner, depending if she has to work.  You could bake her a cake or buy a cake at the store.  You could also get a cute silver necklace or bracelet for a good price, probably for the price of flowers, which don't last.  Hope that helps.|`|abbeQNPwaa	Give her a neckalce or bracelet so when ever she wears it she thinks of you!|`|yf0tevyfaa	You could buy her a day at the spa, especially if she is always working her butt of to make you guys happy. Or you could buy her a makeover at the mall.<br>  <br>  Instead of spending money, you could also give her a pamper day on the weekend. Have your other siblings help you make her breakfast and dinner or clean the house for her and tell her to go out and have a day for herself. You could clean out her car for her if it is messy, that's what I do for my mom sometimes.<br>  <br>  I usually like to do something or get something for my mom that will make her feel good or get her something that she can really use, not something that will just sit and collect dust and she'll never enjoy. Flowers is a good idea but I think you should add something extra, like cleaning the house for her or buying her a day at the spa, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck  (:|`|b2rOIi3Jaa	Well, you could try a necklace or any piece of jewelry really . . .   i got my mom a necklace  . . .she loved it . . .im sorry but i really dnt know how to hel pif  i think of anything then ill let ya no . ..  .oh and a few yrs back my dad bot her a vaccuum . . haha or a giftcard night work . . i know its not orignal and all but it still might work . . .or how about some spa stuff .. . like bat5h n body works . . i luv that store so i think whatever she gets from u she will love . ..|`|5Ye69E9vaa	Well I always get her bath stuff and she loves roses so I get her those and maybe something expensive like a foot spa, its a small bath tub to soak your feet in and it massages them at the same time.|`|hsov3XPZaa	flowers, card, candle, tickets to somewhere, soaps, lotions, ect.|`|UliFcIGtaa	Well... my mom also like to garden and i usually just get her some flowers or a small tree to put in her yard. But im sure whatever you get her she will appreciate it. Good Luck ;)|`|bnvu9HyEaa	ok i know get her a big big big dildo and **** the flowers get a gigolo|`|SRaSbCZtaa	Maybe you could get her a box of chocolates or candy =)|`|zUrZDqT2aa	get her stuff and things she loves...like gardening stuff or nature stuff...!!!
xHKRGEg4aa	because girls want to be the prettiest girl in every guys eyes.  & because most guys will do just about anything to please girls, they tell what they really want to hear.  girls know they aren't supermodels, but they still want guys to pretend that they are prettier than the supermodels.  its basically just that most people want to be the best.|`|13a87592d282ebeb271d1b3129180295aa	I agree with you. a 7 and 8 are a good thing, because a 10 is up there you know!|`|ySvWezDdaa	Hey better to date an 8 than two 4's...right? ;)|`|agTCqkLDaa	1.) I don't won't to be rated.    2.) Who's to say who is and isn't a "10"?      *I guarantee you most guys wouldn't rate me a 10.  I bet you anything, in most guys eyes I fall around the 2 or 3 category ON A GOOD DAY.  I'd post a picture, but I'm truly not fishing for compliments and know what I look like enough to know what guys think.  But my boyfriend has dated a former penthouse model, his ex-fiance was a model and an aspiring actress until she got knocked up, his first college girlfriend modeled....and here he is, with me.  I'm the only ex he's ever asked out again.  I'm not a doormat.  And he IS cute (blonde hair, blue eyes, former frat boy, football player, aspiring pro-wrestler)  I certainly wouldn't be insulted at a 7 or 8 but it probably makes a difference when you already know that you are a 2-3 on a good day...    ETA: I am currently watching a movie where Rachel McAdams has on little to no make-up.  In my opinion, she is TOTALLY a 10.|`|8FLJueRjaa	shawty right there is a "5"   Ay  a "5"  or maybe a "3"  Ay!  Just playin she a "2"  Ay!|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	oh what ??? 10 ??? 7 ?? 8 ???.|`|w4LKvr0daa	I agree.      Better a seven than a two.|`|rEafx4QTaa	you're right. but never tell a girl to her face she is anything less than a 9. its jus common sense.|`|C2bh4Jtcaa	I would think 7 or 8 would be nice to be. I havent seen a "10" girl in a while.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	Dude...tell the girls you'll never date they are 7 or 8.      If you want to go out with or have sex with any woman....make sure you've convinced them they are a 10 in YOUR eyes.  You'll never have a problem meeting, dating or getting a woman in the sack.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	If its a 6 or below of course girls will get offened.    The celebrites out there can't be a perfect 10.    If the women were not wearing makeup, they wouldn't even be close to a 10.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	I've never met a ten.  I think a ten would be someone who is absolutely gorgeous, without having to showcase her body to be able to feel pretty. Someone beautiful, cute, adorable, pretty, alluring, charming, all put into one.    A 7 or 8 is someone who is really pretty, and definately above average. Not anything to be upset about. I think girls just like to feel appreciated, and even more so, to be perfect. I'm not sure if perfection is possible, to be honest.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	Yea because some pretty girls grew up hearing constant compliments from their family, friends, boys, etc. When they grew up they still believe they are the center of attention, but when they don't get it...then they feel shocked because they are not used to that.|`|w2yh8Acraa	when my bf says that, i get mad, if anyone else does, i'm flattered!|`|qpkNrn8iaa	i dont :)|`|Rrd4Gxvcaa	No clue, but I totally agree with what you are saying.|`|lsFcvd32aa	I have no clue man. Things change to much.|`|0pqZsSRYaa	i'm maybe a 5 or so, and i definitely dont see it as an insult... thats who i am and what i look like. i don't worry about what other people say about me...|`|N3bVguIgaa	the whole number rate girl system is kind of stupid in my opinion|`|cl1pJK38aa	Because a lot of girls don't want to think they're anything less than 10, but I know what you mean and I'd be happy with a 7 because that's still pretty high up.  That means that you look better than 70 percent of the people.  Those are pretty good odds.  A 10 to me is nothing less than drop dead gorgeous.  The type of person who causes your eyes to just be glued to them.  There are hardly any celebrities who are actually 10's.  It's all makeup.|`|cewWPIzIaa	I'm not so sure the entire rating scale is accurate.  One person's 7 may be another person's 10.  Plus Bo Derek was considered a 10 (because of her role in the movie by the same name), and I never found her to be all that attractive - not even a 7 much less a 10.    Like they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|CtNs7EAsaa	yea that system has lost all meaning. to my idea of the system i have only met one 10 in my entire life and right now im trying to talk to her and see if anything can happen. most girls who i see i would say is around 6. me and my friends stick to a true system and dont get exaggerated but we lie if girls ask us what we think of them. this other girl i like is probably a 7.5 and her personality and confidence is a 9. shes great! shes self driven and down to earth.|`|k9c7MoyPaa	Ya man I hear ya, I think 10 is a mythical number that has never even occurred. Its unobtainable.  9 are usually girls you want to look at and do but 90% are to high maintenance to spend any time with. 8 is hot but a lot of work. 6-7 is relationship material. When you love a girl it bumps her up to 10 anyway which being a mythical number is pretty friggen awesome.|`|NrHRST3Baa	7 is kind of an insult.   8 i think means that guys think you are pretty.  9 means they think you are reallly pretty  and 10 is like stunningly beautiful.  it depends on the guy really and how they see you.  theres only like a couple guys i've seen in my lifetime that i would say are a 10. but im only fifteen tho hah.  In celebrity wise, chace crawford in my eyes is a perfect 10! yuuummm|`|cp38lX51aa	first we must dulge into what 1/10 really meen. Lets go back to 6th grade. Fractions=decimals=Percents. So 1/10 = Bottom 10%. There are about 3 billion girls in the world. If you are a 1/10 you are roughly in the bottom 30,000,000. NOt to shabby. Most celeberties then would be in the top 30,000,000 best looking people in the world. Thank you|`|NuGVVrDxaa	In all honesty 99 out of a hundred could not have a 10 rating.  The girl/lady would have to rate a 10 in all aspects and those would be extremely rare.
VcrDOsFKaa	ugly ideas......|`|wAoNbpVlaa	wow....just ask her. if it happened once she might as well do it again.  wear protection! cause that would be fu(ked up if you got your friend pregnant with your kid or got something.|`|P38ULZbraa	Hmmm... sounds interesting, can I join? Just ask her if she would be interested in doing it.|`|hChy7BAPaa	oh well if she's done it before...then just be like, "yo i know this girl who wants to have a 3some with us...are you down for that?"|`|TsmqhvZHaa	sounds nice|`|NgpHScXnaa	ewwwwwwww|`|AbtCfY1caa	ask her if you are not serious about any sort of long term relatiionship.|`|yEDR0fnOaa	Just start talking to her about it. Set up some ground rules for the 3 some so neither of you gets your feelings hurt.|`|a5a50191dfc01b41eb49850adcd033d5aa	Man u amaze me this is a very good opportunity and try to convince her telling how much fun it would be so have it dude u'll enjoy it till last moment|`|g1ubNxpRaa	eewwww, why do you even have a girlfriend if you're going to shark around on other girls?|`|c32MJwDJaa	Have the girl who wants to have a threesome ask her.|`|61229a5edd65b7a3460d98d36aeb272aaa	Have your female friend approach your GF and feel her out.|`|49IbcrLaaa	Uh with extreme care...  She may take it the wrong way even though she's done it before.|`|2jnpvyzaaa	just think if u bring her up she will probably think "whats going on"|`|0pqZsSRYaa	if you have an understanding relationship then just bring it up... say, "hey i was thinking i want to try that threesome thing. is it ok with you, babe? if it isn't then we dont have to..."    just be honest... if you're honest you should usually get what you want within reason|`|ixV3Pi1Haa	ew... get ready for your girlfriend to get pissed as hell. either she'll get pissed when you ask her, or she'll get jealous as it's happening, or she'll get pissed when she regrets seeing your with another girl afterwards. grosssss|`|xpiGWrdMaa	she might kick you really hard in the nuts when you ask her.  if she doesn't, she should. you're stupid.|`|8FLJueRjaa	bring it up when u two r a little drunk    then the next day and ask if she remembers talkin about it|`|KXZm6rfRaa	Ply her with a few drinks and you and your female friend can cozy up to her.  Have the girl sit next to her and have her put the moves on her while you go to the bathroom (or some other lame excuse to leave the room) , then note the mood when you return.|`|M2JNgbI1aa	just ask her straight out of no where|`|v3e6NDYbaa	The worst thing you can do is to ask her and talk about it.  Once you do that it will have a 'weirdness aura' around the whole topic and it will never happen.    Ok here's what you do:  You and the girlfriend start hanging out more with the friend.  Just friendly hang out where the the friend looking all hot and stuff.    At some point when you are with the girlfriend alone you say 'omg!  so and so has such a crush on you'  her-really?  you-yeah but i'm not supposed to tell    Thats it, let it stew in her mind for a while.  Always make it about a fantasy that she has not you.  You want to let the opportunity present itself but not forced.    Oh and google 'dual induction massage Neil Strauss'.  Its the Rosetta stone of threesomes.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	aw common it had happened before so its kinda easy to bring it up again if she enjoyed it the first time..    just ask have u ever thought of having a 3some again? and then move on to ask..
VSVQHKwKaa	Yahoo fan, <br>  <br>  I think she told us that she gave him permission.<br>  <br>  Passenger,<br>  <br>  One thing about guys...we have very short term memories. That's why guys can be smashing each other into the ground, then be sharing a beer later on that night. <br>  <br>  So, don't worry about making a big formal apology. In a way, that just forces him to accept it and bury his disappointment and anger.<br>  <br>  Just treat your man extra nice over the next couple of days. Big kisses when he comes home. Lots of hugs and touching. Something warm in the oven would go miles. A tender word here and there will do wonders. <br>  <br>  And give him some extra special loving soon. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, he'll exercise the MAN judgment call...."I can be angry, or I can be well fed, kissed alot, hugged alot, and be having awesome sex."<br>  <br>  He'll choose the latter. Believe me. He's a man. He'll choose the latter.<br>  <br>  You're right not to lie about the car. But he's not distressed over the car choice. <br>  <br>  He's more worried that you no longer trust his judgement.<br>  <br>  So as a bonus, the next three choices that come up (where to eat, what to do, where to go on the weekend, ect), not only agree with him, but get excited about it!<br>  <br>  "That's a GREAT idea! I've been thinking we should (eat there, do this, ect). How did you know that's what I wanted?"<br>  <br>  He'll grin and his doubt will vanish. <br>  <br>  Remember, words don't stay with a man long (the ears are mostly ornimental). But your actions will be remembered for years. <br>  <br>  Treat him well, and all will be well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|uvWuVWb1aa	When he gets home, tell him you'd like to go for a ride in the car. Let him know that you're very excited that he got it. If he asks about you not liking the looks, simply say "It's not something I would have picked out, but it kind of grows on you!"|`|mYmR5cX5aa	A simple apology and state that you realized afterwards that you did tell him to buy whatever car he liked. You are now finally glad he has something more reliable. <br>  <br>  Oh...and cook his favourite meal would put the icing on the cake. ;)|`|kEtYEmhqaa	Sell the car.  He will remember that day until the car is gone.  Believe me, my sister had a similar thing happen and the car remained in the family for 12 years.  She didn't forget that day until the car was gone.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Don't lie and try and back track and say you like it, at least not the way it looks.  Show some interest in hearing about it and say some really positive things in response to what he tells you about it.  He already knows you think it's ugly so don't try and take it back or cover it up.  But I'm sure there are some really positive things about the car that he can tell you that you can "pretend" if necessary, to be impressed with.<br>  <br>  Don't beat yourself up too much about it.  Sometimes our initial reactions come blurting out before we can stop them.  You weren't intentionally trying to be hurtful and you can make sure that he knows that.|`|AA11857809	It doesn't matter...you do have your own car ....and you did tell him to buy whatever he wanted....you don't have to lie and tell him you like the car...(think he's already aware of that ) just sweetly tell him that whatever makes him happy is all that counts, besides, you can always tint the windows so no one will know it you going down the road ...and you can pull it a little farther back in the yard so the neighbors won't notice. Make your apology fun for the both of you ...my god, it's only a Lancer, I'm snickering too right now ....  just look at the conversation piece you two will have to enjoy for some time...|`|DTog0VZWaa	To build on what opetke said...check out the car online.  The Lancer was picked by Mitz to offer an upgrade racing version at mega bucks.  (EDIT:  I see from other comments - that is what he bought.)<br>  <br>  So, somehow it must have appeal to guys, & be fast.  After looking at fun, good reviews, maybe you can be even more geninue that he made a good choice, & you just weren't expecting or use to this car.  It's not a BMW, Acura or Infinity...it's a totally different intention in a car.<br>  <br>  Remember too you may come to love it...so doesn't hurt to make sure he knows your first impression isn't always your final one.  All that love'n stuff with the idea that your a girl, might help him think you just didn't "get it" because...your a girl.  (I'm a girl who likes to work on cars, but I don't get the looks thing very much & I'll admit to it.)<br>  <br>  Tim - any chance you can cook?  When we'll have good old  trade worthwhile...!|`|HVM5aXa8aa	Hm.. <br>  <br>  Well, I think its more important to let him know that you are happy that he found a car he really likes.  I think it is more important for him to realize you are happy for him (which I assume you are) than to believe you find his car aesthetically pleasing.  <br>  <br>  It probably would help if you bent the truth and bit and said it wasn't so bad, though. haha. <br>  <br>  BTW I googled Lancer and the 1962 one isn't so bad - it's kinda cool, actually. I assume he has one of those newer, sportier ones though.<br>  <br>  PS: I just realized the nice looking car I was talking about is not the same car - lol.|`|2YX18RE2aa	Well if that car happens to include the letters EVO behind Lancer he has purchased a very nice midlife crisis car. They are very quick and handle great.<br>  <br>  Hideous is in the eye of the beholder and I'm sure the SUV you are probably driving is every bit as hideous and abhorrent to people who like Lancers as this car is to you.<br>  <br>  BTW I don't drive a Lancer only lose to them.|`|SHARt1k3aa	He's not a woman, he could probably care less about what you said.  If he likes it, he likes it and nothing you can say can make him stop.  It isn't that big of a deal and you are probably putting too much thought into it.  Just leave it be and tell him If it makes him happy, that's all that matters.|`|ewQaf29oaa	You did tell him to buy whatever he wanted-if it were me I'd apologize and say something along the lines of "its not the perfect car for me, but if you love it, Im happy". And maybe say, next time we get a car, its my turn to choose.|`|7XIa76Usaa	You told him to go out and purchase a car, which he did. When he did purchase a car you kicked him in the shins. I bet he really thought you would be pleased. Lots of love and romance would help and let him know how much you like the car.|`|eawDlYHnaa	say you prefer the inside much better.|`|dVlLahozaa	just focus on the positives and if he liked it well then let it be|`|BLnXhWoTaa	you should wear lingerie.  something you find ugly, perhaps, like the ones with the feathers and flouncy ruffles.  then say things like 'vrrrooom, baby, whatcha got under that hood?'  and 'oh, baby, you don't need a prosthetic on wheels'.  if you don't have anything in the color of the car, run to frederick's immediately.<br>  <br>  edit: cher, i know i'm a gay goy and all, but will you marry me?  my truck needs work.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	You spoke your mind - what's the big deal? The two of you are not always going to like the same cars, same clothes, same music, same movies, etc. You have nothing to apologize for. If you feel that as long as he's happy, you're happy - that's all that counts. I see absolutely no reason for apology, and I'm willing to bet this is not the first time you spoke your mind with him. Some of us are more opinionated than others. Not a biggie.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Unless you want him to think you hate him for the entire five years of payments, then yes, you do owe him an apology.<br>  <br>  He should've consulted you first probably, but that's not the point.  The biggest problem people have in marriage is a total lack of respect for each others' opinions, which is what it sounds like on paper.<br>  <br>  I know you didn't do it on purpose and he knows you spoke in haste.<br>  <br>  Did you actually want him to buy the cars that were twice as much in price?  Don't you think he did you both a favor?|`|QE77Oxtqaa	Lancers are pretty ugly, but,have good gas mileage and are fairly comfortable to ride in.<br>  <br>  Just say"Let's take a ride in your car, perhaps looks aren't everything"<br>  <br>  Sing it's praises if you enjoyed the ride, <br>  <br>  Then, treat him to dinner and a carwash. :)|`|CuGAYMlbaa	you owe him an apology you were wrong it is that simple. you stand by your man right or wrong your comments should waited until you were home|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	Oh, sorry for you. You know, though it would make a funny scene in a sitcom (say a Coulpling episode).<br>  <br>  There are already some great answers, personally I like <Opeke> (or however it is spelled).<br>  <br>  Do not apologize for thinking it is ugly. He will know you are lying and it will not make things better. You can apologize for blurting out how ugly it is as long as make it sure you are apologizing for HOW you said it, especially after having already told him that anything was OK.<br>  <br>  Do play up the non-looks appeal of the car.<br>  <br>  Do find some other ways to fluff his decision making ego.<br>  <br>  If you can make a joke of thinking it is ugly that might help.<br>  <br>  PS: I have never owned a new car. I know you already consider yourself lucky, but remember to tell him.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	The magic words in this situation are:  "I am truly, deeply happy that you got a really cool car that you will enjoy driving.  You work hard and deserve to have a fun car."  <br>  <br>  As for your opinion, which he may ask for:  "Any car that makes you happy is a beautiful car".  <br>  <br>  You are a very self aware person and you get high marks an honest mistake and wanting to fix it.  I have a Volvo S60 which my wife doesn't like - but like you we each get our "own" car and get to buy whatever we want under 50K. <br>  <br>  As for his EVO, I am jealous.  You can tell him that a software executive on Yahoo said the closest he ever got to driving the EVO was on a simulator.  A PS3 - Gran Turismo 5, with a large HDTV screen and a really high end ($150 force feedback) driving wheel.  It drives AWESOME in the simulator, maybe I will test drive one in the "real world".
9N84vUpTaa	Oh wow... This is a tough one. I wouldn't really know what to do in your situation either, but it seems like you really care about him, so i think you should go visit him when his parents are out, but you know that he's home. But if you don't want to do that then you need to talk to one of your parents or an adult that you trust, because he obviously needs help if he resorts to drugs when he's depressed or upset, and obviously drugs can kill you, so you really need to get him some help, or go over there and tell him that he needs to get help or you're going to do it for him. You can't let him do drugs when he's upset, even if you're not sure if he is doing drugs. Because what if something happened to him one day because of the drugs? imagine how horrible you would feel that you didn't do something sooner. Your best bet would probably be to get him help or really try to talk to him about doing the drugs, and tell him how bad they are for him, and tell him that you really care about him, and that you don't want anything to happen to him. but if he's high at the time that you try to talk to him about it, then he's not going to understand, and he wont remember what you talked about the next day. Good Luck! I hope I helped!|`|w6weeb7Daa	If you're really concerned about him, go to his house... Bring weed with you that way you can smoke together and he won't use cocaine. Cocaine = Bad, Weed = Good because it isn't bad for you. That's all I can think of, the way you write the situation leads me to believe there is absolutely no way to contact him, almost like you're making excuses... Anyway, that's my piece.|`|G4JHpKogaa	Why would you want to be with a coke head? Move on with your life. Than he will see that he made a big mistake. Remember,"he does not know what he has until it is gone" Stick by this motto, and you will be alright. There are plenty of men out there.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well to me it sounds like he dont like you and dont want to talk to you anymore just leave him and be single plus you dont need a guy like that you could do beter|`|MmdWM51faa	heres a real answer <br>  if hes ignoring everything you do <br>  chances are he high<br>  and if he is  <br>  its probly not a good idea to go over there<br>  give it time<br>  if hes mad <br>  he'll get over it<br>  if hes high he'll keep getting high<br>  simple|`|Hx2raTNQaa	if he does drugs dump him b/c he wont be around 4 that much loger try dating somone who answered this question thats has a nice picture (a dude)|`|SKJMQGWNaa	danm your pretty u can go out with me if u want???|`|FoEWvYEsaa	two words...DUMP HIM...<br>  <br>  this describes every boy ive ever dated......<br>  <br>  take my advice.|`|YLzb1cJyaa	oh honey ur bf is a mess! you need to leave that lil junky and move on sweetie im sure u deserve better|`|DlW1u90iaa	i read this question and you were alot like me my bf did drugs to get over dumb stuff then stopped talking to me if i was you i would message him actually email him and say what you want him to hear if he deletes it hes really rude and i dont think you should break up with him just yet wait until he replys if not maybe hes having family problems... just try everything. i hope i helped :)|`|H8eqb4uLaa	wow sounds pretty crazii, but i think yu should wait for him to be sober so yu can ask him wut the **** his deal is and if he wants to be with yu nvr do that stupid fein cocain **** again or he can just be with a crack whore if thats wut he wants and if he leaves yu hes a dick and move on. no-one deserves to put upp with that **** like for real. <br>  Oh an i think yu should just go to his crib and talk things out face to face, and yu can see if he is high|`|vKCS3AVLaa	hmm, you should go over friday. no house fone? this odd? but anywho, go over friday that way you have 2 days to think. say listen babe, why are you doing this? you know its not good 4 u, 4 us? dont you love me? why wont you call or hang out? stop the drugs, do that when your 80 not now. i really want you forever :[ please hunny bunny? and see what he says, if you sit down and talk to him, i am sure he will come around AND WHEN HE DOES HE BETTER TAKE U OUT SOMEWHERE NICE OR ELSE.<br>  dont worry about it, all bf and gf's fight sometimes, its ok. and tell him<br>  disco roboto LOL :] luv u contact buddy <3|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	I think he may not be your boyfriend anymore.  I know that will hurt if I am correct -- but I also think that, in the long run, you will be better off if that is the case.  To be blunt, he sounds like a jerk.  I recommend being pickier, even if that means spending some time alone.  There are worse things than being alone.|`|9sHJz788aa	Honey he mite be cheating on u. The reasin he's not talkin to u is cuz he feels guilty. Dump him. b4 u get to far|`|bjvm87nlaa	a cocaine addict who's afraid of bringing girls over because of his dad?<br>  <br>  lol sounds like a winner|`|N361k5Hsaa	dump him pronto|`|tsfbV5PPaa	I think that maybe he just needs a little bit of time. I think that you should give him a few days, and if continues to act like this, and you think that it really is drugs than you should ask him about it. And if he won't answer, then there is not much you can do.

Just wait for him to come to you. If he really needs you then he knows it, and will come back to you eventually. Why don't you just talk to him at school anyway? If you can't, maybe you should just let things fall apart. He doesn't exactly sound ready for a relationship. Chances are, you can't fix him, even if you think you're the only one that can.|`|vuxef3O4aa	He has lots of Father issue, he using drugs to escape. his father probably thinks, your trying to change him weak man then he already is. If you his friend tell be their, but the same time realize, he at his breaking point from no return. make him leave his dad, and get help from other. by a herbal supplement books so both can read together and learn to detox the body. teach him about self pride and respect for his body. <br>  <br>  Take long time but also, be ready to accept, that he too far gone, you can't help him.
Bx2w3h0faa	Dude man, i'm 21 i'm a metalhead i play guitar love Children of Bodom and all that stuff.     And i'm a virgin also, i've only been with like 6 girls my whole life and they were flings. So dont feel bad man your not the only guy on earth who feels this way i know how you feel right now cuz im goin through it also.    Dont let your disability bring you down, any girl that turns you down because of that is a self centered b*tch who doesnt even know how to get to know someone. Thats really unfair and very childish for someone to make fun of you for your disability they are f*ckin @SSholes that doesnt even know what its like to even feel that way. Trust me one of these days you are gonna get with a girl who is gonna love you for the man you are and not how you walk or what your handicap is.    I've seen beautiful women with guys in wheelchairs, and guys with one foot. Dont let that bring you down. Cuz i dont look like the greatist either i'm just an average looking guy i dont have a beautiful celebrity face like those pretty boy wanna-be f*cks? Do you think i care to look like a model? i would rather look like me then worry about what everyone else thinks F*ck them dude.    Be yourself man, be 100% the real you no matter what dude, dont ever change or pretend, because trust me trust me when i say that you are gonna run into a girl one day who is gonna think you are the greatist ever, because you are gonna treat her like how a woman really wants to be treated and she is gonna love you. Dont ever change how you really want to make someone else feel. I promise you this whole bad-luck Bull-sh*t that you, me, and every other unfortunate person goes through will come to a stop eventually.     We will all get what we really desire someday just have faith man dont give up on being that good person for a girl you want to be. I gaurantee you a girl is out there looking for you and she is going to love you. stay strong.|`|cQSojmCJaa	look you only live once, if you dont take the chance, nothing will happen. and i feel bad, is your cerebral palsy really bad? i know a kid at my church with it and i think its horrible. i hope yours isnt too bad.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	You're 20! You're way too young to give up on finding someone. Just put yourself out there and ask out the girls you like. If one says no, move on, it doesn't mean anything.

Knowing how to play guitar is really good too! maybe you can go up to a girl, play something for her and ask "hey, does this sound good?" etc....Thats a good conversation starter too!     anyways, whatever you do, smile and keep talking! theres bound to be someone out there for you!     good luck!      *I agree with that nightclub dude....just be yourself!|`|kUxJJzzmaa	Sounds like to get over this fear of talking to girls its probly a good idea maby to do some drama performances to get feel of talking if not, do some stage act or even musician, (singer)     Point being you need to work on communication skills and id say that dramma is the best cure for you.|`|7n2gIG0saa	Watch some free live movies bro.

It sounds weird but start small.  Start conversations with any girl around your age, even if youre not necessarily interested.  Once you feel comfortable just talking, you can try to take it further.  The worst thing you can do is put pressure on yourself and then explain it away as something you did wrong.  Rejections are a part of life, don't let them get you down.
nZ7pGQfFaa	My ex is constantly late dropping the kids off to me.  He has me waiting 45 minutes at a time. The courts don't do anything.  The system is a joke.      It's in the favor for the criminals.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	I know of a situation where the orders were violated to the point where visitation was suspended pending counseling of the violator. And the offender risks paying a HUGE bill when a full-on legal assault ensues.    If the custodial parent is the one that is violating the order, he/she risks a change in custody. And the non-custodial parent risks the custodial parent suspending visitation until matters are properly settled.     Either way - the money and time involved should be a threat enough - both parents and the child lose, and the lawyers get money.|`|5k7BexD3aa	Honestly its just usually a slap on the wrist...

You have a choice, weather to give this guy your number or not.  there's no need to proceed on with this guy, if you don't seem to want anything to do with him? ..    - Telling him, is the hardest part, you can either lie or be truthful. Honesty is always best. I don't know you , I don't know how honest you are with people?     break the ice to him however you may please.  Whatever is going to please you, that's how you do it;]    Gd luck,  ? DEEE|`|naySyzfQaa	Follow your heart.

It's like you want to say no because you aren't interested but at the same time you want to be nice. What I have learned to do over the years is just play it off like you really can't stand talking on the phone. If he still wants your number you can give it to him and mysteriously be "busy" when he calls, or act like your parents have very strict phone rules about when you can and can't talk on the phone...After a little while he'll catch on that you just don't want to talk to him on the phone.    Good luck! =)|`|tYhkdr63aa	dont you think it'd be awkward if your parents had tabs on who was contacting you?  since you're on a computer maybe just give him your email or your MSN/yahoo chat thing.      then he can contact you if he feels it necessary and you wont offend him.  Guys that ask for numbers out of the blue(if you're not already friends) are generally sleeze bags and he's just doing it to subside his ego, or to show off to his friends.  So giving him an email/chat will give him the contact information a non-sleeze would want, while still partly denying a sleeze.|`|fXmUiAYPaa	if you really dont want to see him or talk to him or have anythign to do with hime then you should just cut off altogether and not let him feel hope that thereis something. so he can just get on with getting over! and he can say yes to others adn date others!  dont play games with peoples hearts - they get hurt!|`|UBisFL1taa	Don't give him your number...

briRpzL1aa	Let me inform you what she was thinking... "Gee, I really think this guy is cute, but what he just said was a little cheesy and odd... Oh well, I will take the bite and see if he messes it up later"..    In short.. I have seen every pickup line there is, and I personally think that a "Would you like to go out for a coffee later" would have been better... Why??  Because it is more about being who you are..|`|klcqgST9aa	Hahaha, infinite kudos man, that was brilliant.|`|q7ZMQeCMaa	OMG!!!

gN8Vd83Paa	To me that sounds like a prefect girlfriend, man I wish I was the guy you might go out with, but also make sure if YOU break up with HIM that you have a good reason for it because I knew this guy once and him and his friends got pissed at this girl because she broke up with him for no reason, so be careful if you break up with him.|`|5POoQJVpaa	Just don't be a pushover. Be a challenge, even after he asks you out. Not too much though. Don't make it seem like you're not interested, just make him work for you a LITTLE.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	You certainly have the right idea. Everything you mentioned is good. Add doing what he wants to do at least some of the time, and talk about what he wants to talk about.|`|sRKO8s6jaa	All that sounds good.

But, good form.  Good luck with your guy friend, I hope it goes well.
twVyisGnaa	It's a sudden change in personality.  You have to be really careful with who choose to hang out with.  Not every dude is like this.

If not, then you need to move on and find a real man who will take you for who are and show you the real him. if he changes after such a short period of time, then he was only after one thing, SEX... and you don't need trash like that. Once they get what they want, they'll move on to the next "victim".    Cheers =)

3iNobwVraa	I think it demonstrates that people don't enjoy being told they "can't" do something like they are a child.    I might not even want to do something, but someone telling me I "can't" kind of makes me want to prove them wrong!  Of course I'm not 8 years old anymore, so I don't, but I sure want to.    People want and need autonomy.  Society, marriage, religion, and some spouses (who shall remain nameless,) do not want us to have it.  I think it would be really interesting to note, in your paper, if there were answers by the same user where the tone of the reply completely changed.  If you do this, you will have to explain which you posted first, because that could affect this, etc...  But it does sound interesting.  You could go in several different directions with this.    Good Luck!!|`|Ub1IOPsraa	You have a good start for a class paper.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	A marriage is founded on trust, so therefore there shouldn't be any reason for a married couple to be able to go to bars separately. And if a woman loves her husband, truly, she will not be tempted by all the attractive (or in Atlanta, the non-attractive) males in the bar, and vise versa for he men. But then again, the world isn't flat or perfect. But I believe your paper sounds very interesting. :)|`|MVxFOI5naa	I would reframe it a bit to include the double standard that we still have in this society in the male/female relationship arena
KblMZiHpaa	let it be. i know its hard but if you ask her not to tell then she most likely will if she is bitchy/ malicious.    plus if she is bitchy and malicious, chances are other people think the same thing about her and might not take what she says seriously.    even if she IS taken seriously, it will blow over fast. you're not the first person to like someone and you won't be the last. i bet there's alot more drama and gossip floating around your school then your current crush :)    i hope this helps :) good luck :)|`|DobKxnWBaa	apologize, then stop being her friend|`|1cL06jyTaa	ask the dude out before she becomes a ***** about it  then tell her that shes a *****|`|r8LJEJwbaa	Embrace your crush, take him in and get him, then rub it in her face!

Make her feel like you still like her and want to remain friends. She shouldn't want to tell if she thinks you still like her. Or...Do you know any secrets of hers? You could always black mail her.|`|ZPHB8TeAaa	Well if you guys are total enemys and dont talk anymore and insult eachother then she just might tell her other friends who you like. But, if she is a good ex friend then she would just ignore that secret that she knows and not tell anyone..... but thats wat alot of people would like to think ahaha. If she tells everyone dont be ambarassed  just walk saying "yep i do have a crush on him" dont let an old friend make you feel this way.|`|75bcffedeed2e98b419c4ef51d05351faa	You cannot take back the info you gave her.  I question why you call someone "friend" who you perceive as someone who would hurt you in this way.  If she does do this, then remain calm, cool, and collected.  Revenge is not a good policy.  Rise above the inmaturity of your friend and others will admire you for it.  You learn a few valuable lessons here .. one about who you can call friends... and one about how the young man will react if and when he hears the news. If he has interest in you he won't care that your colleague has a big mouth ... he'll be happy the door is open to talk more with you.  Who knows, her evil doing just may turn out to be a positive.  In the meantime, choose your friends wisely ... and if this one does what you think ... I would think twice about inviting her back into your life.  Good luck.|`|eFLiKTB3aa	well, if u start ignoring her and hang out with friends that truely care about you, you won't need  be ashamed, coz, ur friends will protect u!|`|8UgXZ6zuaa	who cares if the whole school knows they will get over it at some point. and as for your frinend/ old friend if she tells then you know you can trust her at all. :)|`|j8zj6JQPaa	girl that is not the type of friend to have.. u need a friend that u can trust with secrets and that wont ***** around so much.. but if u really like ur friend then just talk to her about ur issues to try and work things out|`|RwtHiQufaa	Well if she is 1 of your true friends then she probably won't say anything but if she does well now your crush knows. Sorry all you can hope for is for your Bitchy friend not to say anything|`|leJgHlU7aa	tell her you better back off and not tell no one or you'll tell something about her boyfriend or friends or the guy she likes something embarrassing about her. and kick her *** for being such a *****. and if you have access to her house take a sh8t in her bed. and read her diary and take photo copy's of it and post it on myspace,facebook,etc. AND than get a bottle of kitchup and a knife put some of the kitchup on the knife and make a teddy bear hold the knife in her room. it would be like chucky. she'll be so scared|`|5sYfBSgJaa	Well if she knows you like this guy... OH WELL! It's her word against yours. I have had that problem  before this girl who was not bitchy but clingy! she was that ugly friend that everybody has.(not trying to be rude) She thought that just because she was rich and smart that she was always right and she told this guy i had been crushing on for a couple of years that i liked him and wanted to "hook up". I told him "so marcus i think you are cute but let me get one thing straight i dont like you i just think you are attractive" and after that explain that she is just a crazy friend and this is her way of trying "to get back".    then after she does it if she does do it then you tell her that she is a shady messy girl and this is a perfect example of why you two arent friends anymore.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	i agree     tell her to back off|`|ESwPIkfkaa	who cares|`|6jN3g0x8aa	You could tell a white lie and say that you don't have a crush anymore on that person, and you've decided that they're not for you.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	well dont become friends with her again.. if shes bitchy and you said it to her face i wouldnt take it back..   and evn if she knew you had acrush on someone ans told everyone, at least the person you like will know your intrested. c(:|`|kWIqDkB9aa	First off wayta be for telling her off.

9fpJSgsbaa	You should really get out of this relationship before he completely ruins your self esteem. This guy sounds like he has a mean/cruel streak in him as well as being way too controlling. If you were my sister and I found out you were being treated that way, I would tear him apart at the seams. Do yourself a favour and put your feelings for him aside and concentrate on loving yourself.|`|FHrQzaPqaa	you need to wake up and leave this fool alone. before he start hurting  you. because right now he is messing with your mind.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	This guy sounds like a grade A jackass and you should dump him immediately or he'll just continue to be an emotionally abusive jerk.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	You are way to young to be having an a** of a guy telling you what to do and constantly yelling at you about stupid things. Sorry to say but you need to get rid of the loser and find a real man who will treat you with some respect.|`|fFBFDIpSaa	From what I see here, it sounds like the guy is controlling and abusive. I wouldn't go out with him any longer, if I were you. You certainly don't want to be in this relationship for the rest of your life, do you? I don't you do, as you're asking us about it.    Break if off with him, and find yourself a good man who will accept you for everything you are, quirks and all. A man shouldn't tell a girl not to cry. A girl is more sensitive than a man, and they should be able to cry when they need to.     I hope things go well for you. If he refuses to break up with you, then tell the police, okay? You don't want a guy to be stalking you.
1uSoU8Lpaa	That's really sweet.  I'm not shy, but I do have one tip for you.  When you get into a situation and you feel that shyness starting to take over, instead of thinking about it focus on the girl you are talking to. People like to talk about themselves and if you ask her questions you're taking the focus off of yourself and the girl will feel special and impressed that you care about what she has to say. Keep interested and listen to her, she will then turn to you. But this is a good way to break shyness, taking the focus off yourself.|`|99dea10619143b66ca84b9a70b33c3a6aa	Not at all...  And think about the girl will appreciate if you start talking to her... is not difficult!!! =D maybe she is shy too!!! so, you just try to feel comnfortable because she won't tell you anything to make you feel bad ok? =D  Kisses!|`|QfzUKeR2aa	Sometimes............!!  well no, ALWAYS!! :$:$:$:$:$::$:$$:$:$:$:$::$..........    tips:  -well, just be yourself no matter what, ;D   that's what girls like =D!    Bye-bye!!|`|kGCd8ioRaa	yes I'm shy|`|w2yh8Acraa	i am not shy... ever... i never have been and i never will be... cuz i just have a simple policy: if you dont like what i'm doing, saying, looking like,  acting like, or wateva... then dont f*****g pay attention!.... so yeah.. i am odd... i am unique, i am random, i am completely insane, i am pretty, i am curvy(not fat, i mean it when i say curvy), i am my own person, i am energetic, i have and abnormally long attention span, i like everyone, i will talk to anyone, i am honest(painfully so), i am in your face amazing..  i am just kelly. and i dont care what you call me, i will respond... but if you all me by my sister's name, or if you call my kelly belly, you WILL get an ear full.... i use big words and my brain to intimidate the ppl that try to intimidate me... i am i b***h when you hurt my friends... i am totally the queen bee... in charge.. and everyone i know is whipped... or they keep their distance... i scare the gangsters... i do all of the work, in everything... at my jobs i do other ppls jobs for them cuz they dont do it right, i wear the pants in every relationship excluding romantic ones... i am a hand full,but i dont know how to be any other way, and i rock who i am... and i guess thats my advice, be comfortable in your own skin, and rock who you are, if the dont like you the way you are, then you dont need them!   adios stud muffin!! :*-kiss-|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	awww. that cute.    nah i'm not shy at all.    :D    i'm really outgoing and loud but i think that annoys people. oh well     :D    Xx

O9jrkjgraa	You need to talk him about it.
Z4B93N31aa	i love that thats how my boyfriend  is i like boys that are aggressive and controlling to a certain point  the controlling cant go farr faarr. i feel save around cause hes 6'' and he has muscles and skateboards hes really good.    ugh hes so hot!    but yeah i get you|`|4JGTC2MHaa	I love it. I get my boyfriend to choke, scratch and bite me lol You're not alone :)|`|GBr9YngTaa	No it is very common. It is as if being controlled and having that feeling. Better in sex than in life.|`|RYARNa8Qaa	i would luv it. but i dont want to be hurt!|`|Bx2w3h0faa	Oh god i'm the same way.    I've always wanted to pull a womans hair really hard while i'm getting her good from behind.    I love biting also, i do some serious vampire bites to chicks i dont make them bleed but i freaking dig deep and make them scream.    I have alot of agression, i have that real animal like craving to have sex like a wild uncaged Lion that just got released into the jungle to attack his Lioness.|`|LDKukrPVaa	you're like a lion!
JppKTOPnaa	This is wetarded. Are you Japanese I need a translator.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If I try talk something and he threw me from spoon or folk that really scared of treat on me.<br>  <br>  WHAT?<br>  <br>  Sorry.  I cannot understand any of this.|`|MjoIio7faa	Do not stay in an  unhappy marriage for the children. It is more wrong than right for children to go through the chaos. Sounds to me you  are prolonging the inevitable. So get out and move on with your life.|`|AA11071040	If you are that unhappy with him, just leave him.  If you stay with him for the sake of the children, it just teaches them that it is OK to stay in a bad relationship.  Go live with family members until you can back on your feet.  If you are in the USA, he has to pay child support to help you.  He will probably never change so no use trying to change him.  Good luck.|`|AA12025974	Well,  he should not be throwing anything at you! That is illegal. That is considered as "domestic violence". Next time he might hit you. Call 911, tell them that he is throwing things at you. Next have a bag packed in a car or hidden in the house. Call a women's shelter, get the hell out of there. If you need a shelter number tell the police officer. Most likely, they will remove him from the hose. Get him out of the house, go to your local child support office and file. Last but not least, once he is gone call you friend and family over to the house. Schedule for them to all come at the same time to see you, because you deserve it lady! Enjoy your life.|`|dVlLahozaa	talk to him directly and tell him you want things to get fixed or he is getting the boot.|`|57IDs4byaa	sorry I didnt even attempt to go over what you wrote. Calm down and start over.
3VnE6Sb2aa	Give it some more thought, if you believe in a positive attitude that confirms to you that i am attractive, i am happy with who i am, i look great when i dress up to go out, i look just as great when i choose to wear my daggy favourite clothes & i will be kissed when the time comes without expectations. Time limit, no way! Be yourself, look at improving those parts of yourself that you feel could do with a bit of attention, habits ect. Become involved in something you like where you are able to meet like minded people, you will become more confident & that kiss will happen, when the time comes!|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	hehe.. and how are you not dating material??  don't give up on yourself so quick.    you're fine.. but your sister is getting to the age where she NEEDS to go out and at least go on a few dates..     dating is like learning anything, and the first few years are going to be tricky trying to find what you want and how you interact with the other sex in an intimate environment..|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	You are Never to old to Start dating or to find love.There is someone Special out there for you and for your Sister and you both will fine them in time.Best of luck.|`|QDEId9Asaa	Its never too late, but late I would consider to be 30    but you are still young,|`|60UGQvMSaa	Ummmm, get out there and start dating, you won't get to be with someone with that type of attitude(pouting and being negative towards yourself). Dating ends around 60 I would guess. =) You have a long way to go, my aunt had her first boyfriend at age 39 and got married when she was 42, so anything is possible. If you live under a rock, then you probs won't find someone. Just be more social, find a guy, flirt a little.|`|AA11559211	im in that bucket too  just dont tell them and only jump in when you are ready and any time is on time no to late
qdyLRbT4aa	Yes but only if she's serious as well and didn't act like she's still in high school.|`|vHwYENVjaa	Let me tell you a story, my boyfriends sister is 25. Her husband is 40.    They got married in less 6 months, and have been married for almost a year now. She liked to sleep around, they met at the gym she worked at, obviously he was a tool who regularly worked out and liked to pick up younger girls.    Of course she won't tell you this, but there's no other reason they got married than that he knocked her up. Surprisingly the month they got married is around the same month she announced pregnancy.... ooh what a coincidence.    Personally, most of these guys are perverts..    Yeah, some might be more attractive, but those are usually womanizers.|`|u0ipviQsaa	Well, if said guy is able to score a 20 something girl, i'm sure they'd do everything in their power to keep that girl, as it may be their last 20 something hurrah ;)|`|QC94IKIxaa	Oh God yes!!!!! Well, I did. A long time ago!|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. I think this formula works.
vw4KXRlLaa	Because he is fifteen years old and he was obviously far too immature to be having sex at that age, was completely unaware of the consequences, and will probably never take responsibility for his actions.    I know it sounds terrible but you both messed up badly, and unfortunately women get the **** end of the stick when the father won't act like a man and take responsibility.    Turn to your family for support because this guy is not going to be a reliable father, and will probably not be your boyfriend for long either by his doing, or by yours if you know what's good for you.|`|pdKjQSaSaa	he's scared and thats still not rite that he's doin that but jus talk to him|`|Y7RVUZ9Yaa	He probably feels that he needs to blame you, but in fact its not , its both your faults.Im really not trying to be the biggest meanie who walked on this earth but based on what you just said, I think you accept the responsibilities, and he doesn't.|`|aq6z5AF1aa	He made you pregnant? I guess you had no part in it. You are both responsible for your pregnancy. He is 15 and too young to be a father. You are too young to be a mother. How can the two of you support the baby? Your bf wants his freedom and his life. He doesn't want to be stuck with you and a baby. He is probably hoping that you would just disappear. What do your parents say about this?|`|jLKcuMNraa	because he is immature and 15 that's why. he's probably embarrassed he is having a kid at such a young age. i don't want to sound all preachy but you should have practiced safe sex because he obviously can't deal with the consequences.
h6NqNzHAaa	I used to date a guy 6'7" tall. I'm only 5'6" so a lot of people stared at us. Some women really love tall guys so I think you just haven't found the one yet. At your age the women in your age group are shy to begin with. If you find one you are interested in just talk her up. Show her how charming you are. Good luck.|`|798fd71a8a35dd659424e56c192bf841aa	With that height, hope you play basketball.  Maybe they are intimidated.  Show that you're nothing to be afraid of and start talking to them first.|`|JsR4ypomaa	too tall for me, srry|`|J14tPA9Eaa	well im 6'4 200 ish and some girl have told me im too tall so i would think same applies for you    girls these days are into pretty boys sorry to say|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Damn bro you should go for the nba with that size.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	No, height doesn't matter to me. The tallest guy I ever dated was 6' 4"ish, the shortest is 5' 5". If I like the guy it isn't important.|`|4leDainaaa	Not to tall.   I like Tall guys.  All the guys I've dated have been at least 6 feet with the execption of my current boyfriend, whose close.|`|2jkZD3e5aa	height wont matter if they fall for you|`|xhCvvrzMaa	Probably something else. I'm 5'1" and I have liked really tall guys in the past.|`|SyHmExgtaa	Not at all...I LOVE TALL MEN!!!|`|Okc9dlxmaa	daaaaamn hella tall   it is too tall bt its ok..|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	i'm 5"9 and love tall men ..i mean absolutely adore them but i never seem to find too many tall guys....trust me alot of women love tall men maybe its just something else.|`|f6o0ufjxaa	yes ur tall and some can be intimidated by ur height but if i was old enough fore u i wouldn't be i m all fore tall athletic guys i think there realy hot|`|g59U5kwUaa	nope thats ok my bf is like 6"3 im 5"4 for those wondering neways maybe your just too hot to handle ;-d|`|xR3F2RFnaa	well for me, tall=hot. they just dont know wat theyr missin out on!
UZ2nix6xaa	From what you've said then yes! Definitely, without a doubt... sure there'll be ups and downs but if you love each other like you seem to give off everything will be just fine. Congrats =]|`|UU3AAlkraa	Keeping in mind that it takes more than love to hold a couple to together  treat each other with respect and truth, you will be able to endure.|`|vHwYENVjaa	Based on my current relationship...... If I were comparing it to what you are saying, I'd say you were a match made in heaven.|`|peUNFJH7aa	Many things can ruin a relationship, but with one like yours, it seems like it would take an effort to. :D I'm in a similar situation, we haven't been together as long (only 3 years), but live together and still have all the love and passion that we started with and have the same goals in life. Good things like this are meant to last. I hope it goes on forever for you. :D
AA10250709	Does he know how you feel?  If so, and he's not interested...I definitely would make myself start viewing him as a very close friend...and nothing more.  If it's not going to happen, it's not going to happen--but there is no use in pushing away a great friendship because you feel like you can't get over him.   If you really try, you can move past it.|`|6ZbdxukAaa	you should just wait and see how things end up and if he isn't bothered with you wanting t spend less time with him then i think he trustable i think you should just wait and see how things work out between you too.i did it and i was in the same situation and it worked out great in the end if you have more questions here's my e-mail livin2praisegod@yahoo.com|`|4XRmFAmmaa	if you are both grown then i think you should stop playing around and tell him how you feel even though he likes the other girl  you never know if he has the same feelings for u i think he likes you but he dosn't know how to say it you and him should have a one on one talk with him just you and him if you have any more questions emeail me at lovemelick@yahoo.com|`|e9870b195c18d5e3f306114aa9a9f2bdaa	okay tell him exactly what you just said here, let him know how much you made you feel from the past and etc. being there for you and stuff. if he doesn't come to you; you've done ALL you can do really. just telling them how you feel will maybe make a difference. i hope everything works out. i may not be help but i triedd. .|`|1GxMGmkqaa	sounds like you two share a lot ofyourselves with each other. that is so cool!   when you are there for each other in such a sense and you can agree to spend less time with each other and still be there? that is called letting the winds of heaven dance between yuo! this is a god relationship and one to be nurtured.   theres nothing to hate about loving someone and you sound like you could be onto smething here. go for it!|`|Jl9QAVAYaa	u have u options:    1. let it weigh on ur heart.    2. let him kno|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	You have no idea how much its the same to me.  Me, too.|`|FL0S2tSCaa	yeah and he was yeah and i was all lets do it so yeah!|`|ILdgVBLGaa	tell him how much u care  and why u care  and how perfect he is to u|`|jIkaapKQaa	Perhaps you love him because he was 'there' the time you needed him most. Perhaps he was there because he pitied you, you get what I mean?    I mean, there's a solid friendship there and you know that he loves someone else.  So don't push the envelope because if you truly love this boy, you should allow him to love whoever he wants to love, which might not be you.    I know how you feel because I've gone through all that too and there was this boy who was 'there' for me.  I even thought we were 'soulmates' and that he might be the 'one'.  I had loved him for a long time, I knew he loved me too.  But if you're not meant to be, regardless what you do, you will never be.    So, be contented of how your relationship as friends are, it'll be better that way.  Perhaps it's just brotherly or sisterly love and I assure you, that lasts longer than anything.    Remember, don't go weird on him. and if he does see you as someone he could love, be patient and let him do the proposing or courting himself and not you.    Nothing makes a relationship go bad than a woman falling in love with the man and the man isn't inlove.|`|beX6Rvqtaa	go get your man!! you need to tell him how u feel before she deos...|`|k42OcjGLaa	i can't imagine what you are going to be feeling when your realize you are not in love|`|40qRRVDWaa	y push away why not tell him how u feel he may feel the same, he didnt run when everyone else did! he stayed with u wen you needed help, he seems like an amazing friend and maybe u can bring it up a level, y run? hes accepting all this right? give it a try, tell him wat u think.|`|X7OvS3mjaa	if you love him y would u want to spend less time with him maybe u guys are ment to be together dont push away someone who is aways there for you i feel like you will totally regret that in the end because your trying to end a friendship that makes u so happy
gC8xO53Oaa	Why do you want to spend less time with him? If he's a good friend to you and you him, why can't you accept it as that? True friends are hard to find and if neither want a relationship anyway, why end the friendship? The open honesty between you too concerning a relationship should tell you that for now, friendship is all there could be, but who knows as time goes by!!!!|`|qFiWcJogaa	You two have a good thing going, so don't pressure him, nor your self, just let things take there time. you two will always be there for each other. So stay with a good thing.|`|wFWytGlxaa	You can't be around him.    And not long for more.    That's the reality of the situation.     You either suck it up and be a big girl or you want a relationship.    It's as simple as that.    Just my 2 cents|`|tM35loy4aa	Why don't you just be with him and tell him how you feel.|`|ImENOklEaa	I'm not sure what your question is, but he seems like a really nice guy...and I really think that you should become more than just friends. Good luck!|`|O1WxKk7uaa	Does he know how you feel? if he doesnt you should really show your heart to him maybe it might change things in a better way. if he does know then its really hard to stop liking someone you really are good friends with and wana be around.
SimAO1IUaa	it kind of hurt a little bit but it mostly just felt like kind of a lot of pressure up there... i think it hurt more the second time, but also its not the same for every girl when their hymen gets broken. some say they dont feel a thing, some say it hurt like hell and was terrible and they start bleeding which is normal though, and some just say it felt like a little bit of pressure..|`|1aJjFrUCaa	When i lost my virginity i fell completely in love with the guy. even though we're not together i still love him with everything i have.<br>  <br>  but what i don't get is. a girl can sleep with a guy and she's a hoe.<br>  but when a guy sleeps with alot of girls he's a pimp. WTTTTFFF???|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	It hurts!! You bleed a little, and you will be sore for a few days afterward. If you do it with a guy who doesn't love and respect you, it also makes you feel cheap and used.|`|8UlGeXk7aa	dont do it...<br>  it hurts and you might get pregnant...<br>  it is better if you do it when you find someone that loves<br>  and respect you or else you will lose your pride and feel like <br>  a Whore...|`|3GG5Lx7zaa	painful|`|qlCwiXpyaa	I don't know. I wonder too. But i'm saving myself for marriage!|`|jRSzIzYqaa	It hurts.|`|nctI8wmBaa	well i heard it was painful.|`|bXl12I4Baa	you know, you lost you pride and now you are a uses  woman .you husband will not trust you.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	It hurts the first couple times and you will be sore for a few days, but after that you start to enjoy it and think about it 24/7...|`|LS8LcuRaaa	No, doesn't hurt that much, in fact I didn't really feel any pain at all. It really depends on the circumstances, how relaxed and ready you are and how the guy approaches the situation.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	hurts.<br>  so ive heard/think.<br>  <br>  think about it..<br>  there's something "entering" your body.<br>  basically.|`|KNVjK6Qfaa	It really hurts the first time. If you are with that special one you will marry, or deeply in love with, the feeling of giving that innocense to them is awesome!!!|`|06O8FaOjaa	NUTHIN REALLY
RBQrgByeaa	Antichrist? That sends a signal, huh?|`|f9sL3WgQaa	My hubby does that..Pisses me off! And then he falls asleep to it, snores like grizzly bears having sex and then when I turn the channel wake up pissed that I turned it because he was watching that!|`|AA11967247	i dont care, we're done. i dont really need to be held.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I'm sure it was his total intention of emotionally wounding you while he secretly laughed (in a big, horrifically evil voice) that he had just spoiled your tender moment. I'm sure he woke up in the morning, rubbing his hands wickedly together, wonder what tender moment he might spoil next by making passionate love to you, then finding an unsuitable television program.    Or maybe he, like 100% of the male population, simply failed to understand your feelings at that precise moment.    And like 100% of the female population, you're building this up into some kind of betrayal, rather than an interest in the Book of Revelations.    Here is something you can do about it....hide the TV remote, then make passionate love again. Everybody wins!!!|`|C4bxnKDXaa	Most guys are like this...when they release the exciting romantic feelings release with it. It takes a strong guy to understand that a woman is mroe emottional and too look past hwio he feels to give ehr what she needs...and that is intamacy..e.specially after having great sex. Guys fail here a lot lady...its not just your hubby|`|y21VcTjDaa	That's why you're not getting great sex every time...get rid of the TV from the bedroom!|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Was it a really, really good show? I mean really good? And my wife rubbed my feet while I watched?     Seriously, if he was truly looking forward on watching, I'd think it was a little funny, and I'd roll with it. My wife and I would finish tearing each other up, scaring the pets and re-arranging the furniture, and sometimes right afterward, instead of snuggling and spooning, we'd be watching old MASH reruns and snacking down on junk food.     Sometimes you have to go with the flow. If it was all of the time, I'd complain, but if its just this once, you should grab a snack, and either join in, read a book snuggled up next to him, or make the best of things. The afterglow-thing is good, but being in a great, comfortable relationship is even better!|`|AueAwhQeaa	Maybe time for a change and have some fun !!|`|fMEypXDYaa	Tell him that if he ever does that to you again, that he is going to need the Anti-christ to save his b*tt from you. If that don't get his attention, then move on sweetie, he is not interested in cuddle time with you, just the nookie.|`|AA11587827	should of had sex in the bedroom, oh the tv is in there,  well u said u had some of the best, so what more did u want, (ding) round 2, just like a woman, give them a inch or two and they still want more|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Hey, you just had really great sex... what are you complaining about?|`|I5mNvqGoaa	Watch TV together laying down.  While he's watching TV, I cuddle up on him.  That way, we're both happy!|`|y9CgveCGaa	We're just people.  Just tell us when we do something that is bad.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	Just enjoy what you get :)|`|4JGTC2MHaa	That sucks. Cuddling after sex is always nice. Maybe he's really, really into that.     Guy's perspective: We can always cuddle, but the anitchriist show is only on once!|`|Bh82isDSaa	Hi gal,  Oh that is familiar to me. I am the male who worries about messing up the sheets so let's not linger after-wards. After five years of marriage my wife has never expressed that she would like to linger and just do a  lot of holding and caressing afterwards. You might approach him with:   My sweet lover, I really appreciate our time together the other night, but I want to share how empty I felt when you left to watch the TV.  I really would have liked to....(then you list what would have made you feel a whole lot closer). I think he will understand he "missed the boat" on that one and if he loves you he will improve. Happy loving!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	You have made a very bad choice in husbands.
11441890e5d4be569aa2cdd7b52211d7aa	Well it sounds like this boy is impressed with your intelligence and told his friends. ( And might be smitten ) They proceeded to "check you out" and were impressed by your friends choice and probably said the "hey gorgeous" to playfully embarrass this guy for his crush on you. And, they probably think you are very pretty too.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	he probably likes you or maybe sees you as a potential friend. maybe you should say hi next time and get to know him. :)|`|X1gOkyNqaa	Sounds like your a pretty smart girl and he told his friends he liked you so they were giving you a hard time. Something I would do if my friend liked a girl haha.|`|M5SK3CM3aa	maybe he whats to get to know you try talking to him
peUNFJH7aa	LOL! That's an amazing situation. I'm so glad that you follow your parents rules. Maybe he's afraid that you don't want a hug from him. YOU do hug everyone else. He might think that it's him and is worrying about the same thing. You might want to go ahead and make the move, without all of a sudden hugging him. In the morning or after school you could say something along the lines of "I want to try something new today. How about a hug?" or "You know what I wish you'd do?" he'd ask what "Give me a big ol' hug"|`|h9VfwcK7aa	well maaybee hee'ss juust shyy  uu cann usee excusess to get himm to huugg uu  forr exaamplee saayy thaat uu'ree coldd  usuaallyy thaat'ss a signn forr de guuyy to givee uu a huugg  orr uu cann maakee de first movee  juust surprisee himm byy goin' upp fromm behindd n' wraapp urr armss aroundd his waaist    thaat'ss kindaa waat i do xD
2SSD6BP9aa	No, there is nothing that will make it change colors.    They may be pulling your leg, or they may have heard about how you can change the flavor of your semen with different foods and thought it could change colors too.|`|9vP0elUIaa	no, they are not being serious.  they are just trying to mess with you.|`|7n2gIG0saa	not true.    Check it out yourself.  http://www.goldenavenue.info/viewtopic.p...    If there is a particular movie You want to air tell me I will air it!|`|3LoHfh3saa	LOL!  I googled it and you cant! :P|`|5ekdVDQXaa	there's nothing like that to my knowledge    on the other hand, now that I think about it, injecting dye directly into the testicles would probably do it. . .|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	noo there is nothing that came make it different colors|`|md7qH1fqaa	They're probably thinking of the fact that there are certain medications you can take that will turn urine different colors.  But as the other posters said, there's nothing that can be taken to change the color of a man's semen.
onGWYMcjaa	I would rather have the girl talk to me first, so much weight off my shoulder. Anything that facilitates my life is better. Less work = I'm happy.
LkRivHpTaa	if she tells you nasty **** and gives you a **** load of crap
b8g9gWE0aa	you are 17 years old. you dont have to tell your parents that you have a boyfriend or anything just you know sit them down and tell them your older now and you would like to have the rules kind of switched around... you met a boy or whatever... ease it out to them. my little sister had the same problem. my dad is super strict with her. we didnt grow up in the same household and he is really really over the edge strict. her senior year of HS she did what i told you to do and he compromised with her. he eased off a bit but trusts her a little more now just cause she did that it showed him she was growing up. so just be honest!
l1iCPVPOaa	Say "Oh cool, I was going to hook you up with my friend"|`|15b982f321a32c684f16cd6a17832f31aa	move on...."there are finer fish in the sea"|`|lcc7SZAdaa	go to the club and meet sexy new people =]|`|cR3M6tepaa	well i did somethen like dat before. I planned it out to the last detail an had alot of back up plans the problem is when u get up to doing it ur mind goes crazy ur heart beats fast and u can't think.Well anyway she told me she had a man and all i aid was "ok i understand" so that was it.|`|WV36m31Zaa	you need to be more original that that,, if she says no, then just apologize for not knowing she is seeing someone, ,,, maybe that's the FIRST thing you should ask, after introducing yourself and act like your intelligent|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	Well what I would do is before you ask her out maybe just ask her if she has a boyfriend and if she says no then take it from there. I mean it wont hurt you to ask her if she has a man before you ask her out, it is a smart thing to ask before you go asking someone out. If you don't want to ask her out in person then just maybe write her a letter or a note and ask her if she has a man in it. If she says that she has a boyfriend, or if she just simply don't want to date you then just say oh okay I understand maybe we can just be friends. =] good luck!!|`|1tQef9edaa	Say, Hey its cool. He's a very lucky guy. Can you blame me for asking? ......She may change her mind with time, since you were so nice....Don't be very prideful. Take her response and go with it. Don't blame yourself if she rejects you.|`|87KMkWLuaa	move on you'll find another date|`|AA11305672	You have to move on with life. You can't let one little thing stop you from moving forward and progressing life. I never let those stupid little things get in the way and you shouldn't either.|`|AA11539068	If she says she has a boyfriend, just say something like "oh sorry, I didn't know." You could either continue the conversation from there or just end it and tell her you'll see her around, if you're embarrassed.|`|Lii6IXEkaa	before asking her out ask her if she has a boyfriend, if you don't wanna do it in person send her a text, and then you won't have to worry if she has one or not.|`|a3gFZur0aa	just say... o aight mayb anotha time deucez ( Deucez mean peace or bye)|`|M3RjIn8caa	First talk to her like a person. I hate it when guys walk up to me, check me out (this is totally obvious when they look everywhere but my face), and then hit on me all night. I never take those kind of guys seriously because they don't care about a relationship, they only care about their lust. If you want to earn her respect, start a conversation and become friends with her. Figure out her likes/dislikes, her personality, etc. Ask her questions about herself. This will take longer than one day! It will probably take a couple of weeks at least, or a month or so to become friends. Then you can approach the idea of becoming more than friends. If she doesn't like you like that, then accept that. It doesn't say anything about you, it only says that circumstances/her feelings/whatever stood in the way. Just move on, there will be other girls.|`|2b7NEgyMaa	tell her that u actly asked her out as friends coz ur friends not gonna be around that day.(if she said she 's seeing someone)|`|33O1Ceklaa	kay I'm a girl and I have been asked out a lot  you just need to get to no her and find out these things ............    1:boyfriend or no boyfriend  2:what she likes a cool dude,calm,or whatever  3:and what makes her happy I like people giving me complaments so do all my friends so that's a keeper  And4:be your self around her and calmly just say hey you want to go out?and that's it so hope if helps :) good luck|`|PJZRGsc3aa	move on|`|7yrdcqY1aa	your loss :) haha no, just say alright well maybe we can be friends then!|`|LkRivHpTaa	be like ***** i hotter then him and then slap her or if she just flat at tells you no says what evs then at a party get her drunk and bang her|`|g2R7e2eVaa	Say "oh okay, well bye" and move on to the next one.     You win some and you lose some.|`|uFiJaR7vaa	just say ok thanks,i just thought you were pretty.  who knows, maybe one day she'll break up with her bf and the first thing she'll remember is you being so nice to her.    dont burn bridges.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Be mature about it and just be like "Okay cool."    The last thing you want her to think is that you are a **** head, which a lot of guys misconstrue and try to get unjust "revenge" although all getting rejected did was take them down a peg and show them the real world.    Not that I thought you'd do that, I'm just reminding you, because getting rejected sucks and in the midst of being pissed you won't really stop and think rationally =/
9fpJSgsbaa	I prefer natural and clean, I dislike anything fake or artificial.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	flowers or something refreshing..it might not sound nice..but at times a woman can smell nasty down there|`|rgDLovFhaa	natural is good, smells like the ocean to me
b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	It seems to me like he feels he likes you more than you like him,and he's a little insecure about it.If you like him,TELL him...|`|1UKcEW93aa	Looking at you doesn't mean he likes you or is interested. Also, He might not be looking at you either way, Maybe you're just hoping he's looking at you. But I digress, He was probably jealous.|`|71LeWL4waa	ya he loves ya
WENGBNXhaa	since your interested in music, why not go to one of the music centers. someone is bound to have similar tastes to you. also, you shouldn't be scared when trying to introduce yourself  perfect example (this happened in the beginning of the school year): there was this new girl in my Pre AP Biology class and no one would include her in the groups we had to make. so i went up to her and said "Hi. my name is Angela. I don't like seeing people alone so why don't you join my group?"  very simple but now she's one of my best friends|`|asEV10aXaa	I usually meet people snowboarding, kayaking, or going to a city and panhandling (playing Instruments for money) we meet a lot of people there and usually always end up hanging out with them. or driving around I've hung out with people I met in a car driving next to me lmao just put yourself out there, be outgoing, don't be afraid to approach people and talk, and then you will meet some really cool people.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	I will be one!!!    Friends are hard to come by these days....you gotta work on them for a couple of years!!|`|YwTbCihDaa	Am I not one? I listen to your problems! JK!    Join some clubs that your interested in and get some hobbies going. Meet random people at school (this works but choose carefully. I do this all the time)|`|AA12093934	I'll be your friend =)        That's a good question though good friends are really hard to find =(|`|nyeUUojFaa	join a club for something ur interested in and meet some interesting people there|`|AA11656721	It is hard to find true friends on the internet.  Because you can't really see what they look like or see if they are being truthful. Some people do lie about there personality and looks.  So I think it would be good if you join some kind of group like one that does volunteer work for others.  Most of the volunteers are kind and honest hearted people.  They wouldn't be doing this kind of work if they weren't.  Or if you are religious person, make plans with some people in your local organized religion. If these don't work for you go out with the friends you have now to some new places you have never been too.  Perhaps you will find some new people to be friends with too.  What makes a person likable by others is having a good personality, being opened minded to new things, patient and kind, and giving a listening ear.
q0Z6vSyBaa	OMG! Trent? I think I know you! Do u know Kellie? Is this about her??|`|WFRooU7Maa	How do you go out before you meet.  Unless you do something your not going out, maybe dating but not going out    Tell her that she should be more secure of herself  and that until you do something together   you won't go out with her
ewbuVeTTaa	If you are old enough to drink, whiskey helps. Only thing you can do is forget it and say to yourself, you didn't see a thing|`|KF5pitm8aa	Why the heck was he wacking off in the living room?|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	oh boy, that's rough. sorry you had to see that.  work really hard to forget it. good luck|`|0VBESmFQaa	Let him know you are going into the living room next time|`|AA11108018	It is unfortunate that he did not have brains to go into the bathroom or is bedroom to masturbate.  If he was just sitting there going at it than I would be real care full he may have wanted you to see him.  Confront him in the house, make sure moms is somewhere in the house so you can yell for help if it get out of control   Tell dad I know that what you where doing is natural thing for men and woman but I am shocked that you  would do it in the open like you did.|`|e0urnErUaa	i feel sorry for u......|`|dQDL8iM6aa	Well i guess its normal. Just pretend you didn't see it and act normal. You did'nt see anything else right? If you did then it'll be super awkward! lol|`|Px58B7vBaa	wow thats crazy good luck with that|`|611dee8243ba39b3fdc80516025c988caa	TELL YOUR MOM.. He needs to do that where others can't see.|`|i0XTHaZYaa	Wow. Thats rough. Nothing you can do. Just forget about it.|`|s7Ze2Y3Haa	What goes around comes around if you have to live with the image of him wackin off for the rest of your life, then he should have to live with the image of you pokin the G button for the rest of his life... so just start goin at it in the garage until he catches you, then say this "pay back is a B____" or for more impact "i'm your little girl"      Awful, but pay back|`|pPkFPP8Gaa	Go, puke!    big deal, so what....    The man has to work his rear end off in a job he more than likely cant stand, feed you put clothes on your back and keep a roof over your head.  If your mother did her job correctly, he wouldn't be doing what he was in the living room, so blame her!    Leave the man alone.
yr1xv9ohaa	you seem likeable...but maybe you should wear alittle eyeliner or mascara to make your eyes stand out more|`|9JQiIQvfaa	ugly
aXOyK3uBaa	That's an easy one.    Go out there and ask a woman what "LOVE" is.  She will not be able to define it.     SHE: "Well its a feeling you can't describe, it's when two people blah blah blah blah....."''    Wrong.    LOVE is -->> the overwhelming desire to GIVE.    Whether it be you child, your woman, your car, your family, your friends or your dog... love is about what you GIVE and put into things.    That's why men can truly "love" their jobs.   Or even their cars.  What we put in (investment) is the joy we get out (reward).    If you pay close attention.....  Women tend to believe love is what should COME to them.  They think it's something they FIND - or GET - like a lottery win.    Just listen to how women speak.....    ? "Be patient - Love will come to you."  ? "Love comes to those who believe it" - Celine Dion.    Its crap. Love is the overwhelming desire to GIVE.  What you get OUT of it - is exactly what you put in.    That's why people you "give" the MOST to....   become the ones you LOVE the most.    .... even when it doesn't come back to you.    This is why women don't appear to know what the hell they are talking about when they throw that word "love" around like a frisbee... and it seems like "your feelings" are the LEAST important thing to her.    What is MOST important to her -->> is what she thinks she is supposed to GET.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Because we don't know what else to say after he takes the plunge after only being together a month or so.It is a really awkward moment.A guy once told me he loved me during sex!!I moaned and totally acted like I didn't hear him over the pleasure.I almost said it back so he wouldn't feel stupid though but I am glad i didn't.Guys say I love you too fast sometimes.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Naturally women do not want to be alone...  So they rather say they love you and have you by her side than be alone.     It's pretty idiotic, really.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	She was just using you for sex.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	Sometimes people lie. Men and women have both been known to lead on the opposite gender.   Sorry you got burned, take the lesson and you will do better next time.|`|KwNpyp3saa	This is not exclusive to only women. Men do this as well. Maybe they felt like this at one time and they their feelings changed. Or they say this because they initially don't want to hurt your feelings by not feeling the same way. Later found someone else they want to be with and eventually tell you some lame excuse.     Not all people are like this. Don't give up.|`|0VBESmFQaa	First off sobriety is for quitters!!!,Second i knew some one was going to throw in that " well men" ****, The good thing is now you know the pain that it brings, So 2 options..1 ( this is my fav) get her back!!!!!!!!!!! or be more careful next time|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Dude.    Seriously.    Give sobriety a try.|`|Y6NIOi9jaa	am sorry to hear that but not all woman do that u just had a bad experience,try and find someone else|`|AHeLeaMBaa	I'm sorry that happened to you, but ask any woman, it works both ways.
tG1vTi0Daa	its sounds like a haters game. if u think sally has a problem with u, u should confront her about it and ask her whats up. dont be afraid of another *****, shes probly just jealous of u for whatever reason.
EDCW5t9Vaa	before you buy any products speak with your doctor because all products are not for everyone. You can also visit the neutrogena skin id site to see what type of acne you have and what will be best for treating it....you need to pay close attention to whether your skin is dry or oily etc.....ur in ur adolescent years so acne is bound to happen so dont get too scared...best acne advice ever DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!!!!!, keep your face clean, cut down on junk food and try not to touch your face alot because unwanted bacteria on your face will break you out.|`|Nv86B1mzaa	One really simple thing to do is every night before you go to sleep get a cotton ball and put some rubbing alcohol or peroxide on it. Then just wipe your face off. This helps to clean the skin. Also in the morning washing your face off with dove or ivory brand soap helps. It is soft on the skin and moisturizes it just enough but not too much. I used to have the same problem and when i was asked i started this and its all clear now. Hope it helps!|`|JcZIjpU4aa	If your gf stops liking you because of your acne, you are better of without her. And if you really want to get rid of it, I would recommend visiting the dermatologist...|`|k5wqvI42aa	aww thats cute. umm try proactive? just make sure u wash ur face every morning and night. good luck ?|`|rKsgGHKkaa	use proactive i use it omg it totally works|`|FWxZwSeLaa	I think you should get proactive it worked for me. And if you don't like that try some other products there are a lot to choose from.
peUNFJH7aa	Dating is a relationship. Friendship is even a type of relationship. Four months could be serious depending on how old you are. If you are 16 or under, it could be considered kinda serious, as in, I would make sure to get her a nice V-day gift. 17 and older, it's not really that serious, but it could still develop... a 3 year relationship has to start somewhere.
8m0OWTO8aa	Only you can know. There will never be an explanation good enough to describe what "the one" feels like.       ...You just, know.|`|wevKLcz3aa	When she loves you no matter how bad your spelling is.|`|gHmgBfwxaa	you will know if she is the right one for you.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	haha, that hell?|`|844DGAMmaa	What the "f" are you talking about?    Only "u" know if she's the "1" "4" "u."|`|xgJbxZgfaa	what's "d"?? mean and if u "think" that she's the one then she's not if u have to think about it..|`|J14tPA9Eaa	i dont know
Qbczt3ivaa	HELL NO!          do I need to repeat myself?  can you be less original!?|`|so9M313daa	Dude, pickup lines NEVER work. You should start a conversation and show interest in her, not slap her in the face with a sentence you memorized.|`|R8Vrteoiaa	pick up lines are tacky
9fpJSgsbaa	If you couldn't get one before, I would love to know how dressing up like a freak will help your chances.|`|naySyzfQaa	Of course, we like when guys dress up like vampires...Not!|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	No, not any girl, but certainly a select few will find your goofy little way appealing.|`|Tf19RETiaa	haha yea change your name to edward cullen and girls will be all over you. lol|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Like a vampire? I'm imagining that this has to do with the Twilight nonsense. No. You will basically be laughed at unless you find some sort of weird fetishist.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Not me|`|8O4ttgGMaa	no, just tell them you cant resist the scent of their blood and that you can't read only their mind.    make sure these are 12 year old girls you're hitting on|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Haaa, change your name to Edward Cullen for good measure :P|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	You will be called an idiot.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	well it'll be girls but they might be "vampires"|`|IG4A4nuDaa	only if your skin flashes like diamonds in the sun|`|Xce2KvGnaa	Ok. reality check.    Twilight is fantasy.  This is life, get real dude.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	hahahahah niiiiice...  You would have to start walking really creepily gracefully and talking like you were from the 1800s. and that's only like 1/2 of the girls between 11 and 15... everyone else will just think you're a weirdo.|`|wHL0Jw23aa	lol omg no! lol but read the book nd act like him nd u got it! =)|`|u9CzcKQ4aa	Probably, yes. Laughing out loud|`|mQk9YR3Maa	no.|`|wzdRJxzRaa	DOUBT IT
T3W4Mf50aa	stop doing it 2 him|`|e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	You are with a selfish, self centered, twit. WHY?????????????  Get away from this immature selfish little boy.|`|oeEsnwSMaa	move on, to someone else, he only thinking of himself.|`|zdr2M7vUaa	OMFG tell him i said hes a dumb *** u know ill  be happy *** hell to have a girl like you=) he just needes to appreciate what he has if not dump him|`|jD0nfrIBaa	Sounds like he wants all the pleasure and not dish any out.    Just stop.    If he isn't going to repay the favor, then stop doing stuff to him.    I'm sure he won't like, and will reconsider what "grosses" him out.|`|LHCgLz3Daa	well some guys just aren't in to that. i do think its pretty gay that he will accept a ******* but wont even finger u in return. in my book the guy should please the girl first. GL with ur boy|`|LDKukrPVaa	cheat.|`|44a6538785f4c813b7c382028c366213aa	All I have to say is I'm so sorry to hear that...I could never date a man that refuses to satisfy me in the same matter I would satisfy him. Good luck trying to get him to do it...|`|vyp1Ikl6aa	He's proably scared or waiting for marriage or something.  what. an. ***.|`|3enJVNDdaa	hmm...I don't like my girl to go down on me but I'll go down on her. If he won't even finger you theres a serious problem. Has he been with anyone else before? If he doesn't like his hand to get wet, maybe he'll go for a glove. You should probably stop doing anything for him until he does something for you|`|1ESdcFbtaa	For some reason many men do not like to give oral, but fingering is a bit different. You could try helping him grow fond of juices over time.  Try to explain you don't find it fair you'll do stuff to him, but he won't return the favour.    Try not to force anything onto him though, as it may make the relationship unstable...unless thats what you want if he doesn't treat you equally.|`|78LClSVMaa	Yea I agree with the answer below. He is being selfish. Don't go down on him that much anymore or even at all. He doesn't deserve it if he won't please you. It should b equal pleasure n he should know that.
vCTMZKrgaa	sounds like a ho to me.|`|LDKukrPVaa	thanks for all the information so we could help you with you're question.      as long as youre ripped though,  the answer is yes.|`|qdep99QWaa	if u like a girl then be brave, be yourself, and just go straight up to her and say "i like u alot and i always liked u so will u go out with me"?|`|OmWamvEvaa	you should go on a date and get to know each other, then decide if you want to go further with things|`|asEV10aXaa	turn off. It was to easy. I like the chase.|`|fQifcI9oaa	THen the relationship could possibly go farther or it could possibly end in a million pieces when you find out dark secets about her that don't set well with yur stomach.    Hope this helps.|`|GjsrcsZkaa	Then you must be god damn HOT !!!|`|8m0OWTO8aa	Then you better start getting to know her, before you are too deep into the relationship|`|lz6vAjSEaa	well|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Umm, that could work out a numerous amount of ways. Most of the time, it turns out physical. If you can hold a good relationship, then you have to really try to get to know her, and go out with her as much as possible. If not, then you will have nothing to talk about.|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Yeah, that's normal everyone does that these days and many sleep with each other the first night they meet.If you don't like that do not say lets just be friends! Just take it really slow, like no kissing or anything until you get to know her. If she thinks you're a prude well then forget her! You are what many women are  looking for.|`|60UGQvMSaa	Then congrats. Get to know her on the first date. Call her in 4 days.|`|NQlsHCOfaa	Umm than she's cool with it and you guys go out

He drinks half and leaves the rest in the container on the table, nightstand, garage, coffee table, etc etc.  I thought maybe he's just a little thirsty, but he likes bottles, so rather than waste the water left, I bought him those kiddie-sized water bottles, OMG he drinks half of THOSE and leaves them around. Now i just laugh.|`|1epjqrflaa	He leaves a pile of clothes next to his side of the bed and always says he is going to clean it but never does. Leaves a bunch of little work notes on his night stand. Always adjusting his self ( prob cuz he is huge)  but still! He gets annoyed when I dress sexy, and comments on all my clothes when I come home from shopping, " is this a shirt for Kassidy"? My seven year old, and he knows it is not for her but that is how he says it is way to tight!|`|pA1M2HSoaa	what i cannot stand in anyone that i come n contact with is when people jump down your throat about stuff. like if you give your opinion and they give you crap about it. if you dont like what people are doing then look away. live and let live is what i go by.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	all the people who ask do they like me or not here on Y/A .|`|lgxE5nUoaa	The constant burping and farting.

I have to clean the toilet more often than i should for only the 2 of us.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Well, I can tell you what my wife does that drives me nuts. She insists that I put my shoes away in this shoe chest every single time i walk in the door, even if I'm leaving a couple hours later. She says it looks messy. I dunno, it bugs me. Also, she alphabatizes her canned food which is weird and if I mess it up she goes crazy on me, lol.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	He cuts his hair while standing over the kitchen sink, and the hair usually falls on the dishes waiting to be put in the dishwasher, so hair is caked on them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he can be overly romantic. You know what, you don't always have to refer to it as "making love!"|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Sometimes he can be long-winded, and go on and on about the same thing. I do pretty good tuning him out, tho.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	The house always needs to look like no one lives there. Perfect all the time.
lbb4luo2aa	to one of my friends i would say- I know that you've been through a lot of things this past year, but I think you shouldn't blame other people for it because some things were partly your fault. Example: When you slept with your boyfriend after only going out for 6 days then he broke up with you a week later and you said he has raped you, hey guess what? no, you wanted it. Also I find that you want to kick everyone's ***, even if they never really did anything to you? Like your boyfriend's ex or something? She didnt do anything, and you want to fight her? What is wrong with you? I wish instead of saying things you'd do them, and I'd wish you would act more like your old self and less like a whore. I miss 8th grade and how everything was simpler. You were a better person back then.    To my other friend- Dude, you are awesome, I can trust you with anything! If you don't like something, you say it straight up and some people may think you are a ***** or they may call you mean but I know your reasons and why you act like that. You told my why you are the way you are and I really appreciate that because it shows me that you can actually trust me and helps me understand you better. You don't act like other people and don't follow trends, you don't care what people say about you and if they don't like you. I admire you a lot and hope our friendship lasts all through highschool and college.    Note: Highschool sucks, everyone changes, and sometimes, not for the best.|`|u4Zu2v0Paa	I would say-- "Please pack up your computer and bring it back to the store.  You should have never bought one if you refuse to learn how to use one.  I was not put on this Earth to always fix your mistakes either".|`|AA11618542	Oh, there are many things that I'd like to say to many of my so called "friends"...    To my true friends, of course, I'd like to say that they've always been there for me, and consequently, I'll always be there for them.    To a certain friend, though, I'd like to say that she is a stuck up, self centered ***** who isn't going to get anywhere in life because of her attitude.     And to another certain someone, I'd like to say she's a desperate attention-seeking jerk who flirts with just about every single guy.    And now I've let my feelings out and I feel so mucb better. =]|`|owpjHPOxaa	hmmm...    ...Amy, you save my life!  The rest of you, are you really my friends?  lol    ... and dudes, stop wearing skinny jeans.  They don't flatter your chicken legs. .|`|8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Friend 1: You are a gold digger. Stop pretending your not.     Friend 2: You are the most wonderful person ever.    Friend 3: You are very nice and caring but your personality is annoying and it's hard to spend a lot of time with you.    Friend 4: You neglect your children. Get with the program and start being a good parent.    Friend 5: Why don't you ever ask how I'm doing? Why do you just ramble on about yourself?    That felt good!|`|VLRkJOOuaa	I would say, "Just because you're burning with T every other weekend now, doesn't mean you're any different. Seriously. We used to be so tight before, but now you think you're this bad-*** chick. You're not as cool or popular as you think you are... fuckk off."    Haha... to my ex-best friend, now turned frenemy, who is always talking to me about her "girls," and how if they got in a scrap she'd join "for the girls!"|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	To Person 1: "I'm in love with you."    To Person 2: "You are so shallow!  You only take in boys you think are hot.  And I really hate when you think you're too fat, too ugly, so dumb because you have no idea how beautiful you are.  There are so many other people who you and I both know need help out there and all you go on about is how unattractive you are and how attractive others need to be.  God, come on!"    Person 3: "Am I really your friend?  I mean you're mine but am I yours? You act like I'm invisible when you're with other friends and you become all nit-picking and get them to gang up on me.  When we were all laughing at a joke, I added something and some of them were about to laugh until you said "Okayyyy, whatever" and acted like I was stupid.  I mean hello, I'm standing right here."|`|Rwvxxalmaa	i would say: stop asking me such judgemental questions!!!!!!!!!..to one of these girls who tries to act like my best friend. -_-|`|GL6WkpONaa	i would tell them that they r all immature babies!|`|3BsddZ9taa	in friends line there is no necessity to think over anything to can say what you feel about them you can see the time and say on a good manner.|`|tKc69EoOaa	stop being a controlling, smug tyrant and let people live their lives without you judging them every step of the way. allthough you mean well, your lack of understanding and stubborness infuriates me. My opinion is never considered, and i am never right. you act as though i'm an idiot.     and of course, she wouldnt listen to me.
CBa9G4j4aa	Guys do I think. Girls get more emotional with this kind of thing and guys are just like "Ohh hot girl! Let's make out" lol and the girl actually values the relationship USUALLY.|`|AA11263103	both equally|`|qoP7qVrSaa	It's hard to say today. Men are the ones who tend to, I think. Girls are by and large, more faithful. However, much depends on the fabric of society - whether paternalistic or maternalistic, run by men or women according to the descent line.<br>  Finally, it also depends on how is cheating defined. I watch a documentary on a tribe in Inner China where it's alright for women to have a lover and a hubby... So?|`|B7idbFNVaa	Guys, because we want SEX MORE than girls.
NEiA9pw2aa	Hi Dear !    Your situation is not very complicated. 1st you have to learn  what a man is looking for, than you have to act accordingly.  may be he wants to be friend with you only or only having   a short term relationship ? You have to identify the situation  and act accordingly.    I also faced some situation like this...& i would like to  tell you that i got a very good book on it that helped me get him back.    Get Back Your Ex- The Magic Of Love    www.infoindia.co.in/getex/|`|1r05fktRaa	c-ou make someone like you|`|DyC0ITSHaa	first of all you should never try to get someone to like you if they dont see how great you are you shouldnt waste your time and try to confince them find some who appreciates you.|`|654CKsm9aa	play hot and cold back! people always say that it's pointless and annoying, but it works. almost every time.|`|g59U5kwUaa	i have said this soo many times but "if you love him let him go and if he's for you he will come back"..just wait he probibaly will come back when he realizes what he is missing ;-d|`|A3pVEWm0aa	Be straight up with him. Tell him that you want a commitment and see what he says. If he doesn't want to move into that kind of relationship and you are tired of the hot and cold game, move on. When it comes down to it, playing hot and cold is just like playing mind games and no one deserves that. It might be hard but unless you want to try and work on your mind reading abilities, then you need to ask him what he wants. If he doesn't know... tell him that when he does, he can come and find you.|`|Rwg38ZxOaa	dress like a hooker and he will want you
mEcONtvQaa	Yes, it sounds like he's shy. It's a lot easier for a shy person to communicate over the phone or by text. The problem is that if it gets too comfortable that way, trying to talk in person is even harder. Did you try talking to him? Just small talk - ask how he likes the class, ask him what he likes to do, compliment him on something he's wearing - that kind of thing. If you can bring him out of his shell a bit, ask him if he'd like to go get some coffee after class. As long as you keep showing interest, you'll have a chance. Good luck, hon!  :)|`|7g8UHUJgaa	after talking and texting you, he must realize how much he really does like you..so he does not want to make himself look stupid or act stupid towards you.    guys can have like a million things rushing through thier minds just like us girls.     my guy friend did that before.    he asked me to see all the football games with him and when we do, he  will not look at me or talk to me.    im like WHY??    guys panic too.    they have fears.    deep down they have a sensative place for the girl they care for. hard to find it, but it is deep in there.|`|oYdsU2ROaa	He likes you but he is shy and can not tell you how he feels|`|nfYAIDGqaa	Well, he probably likes you so much that he is really shy, sometimes guys have moodswings like that, so maybehe doesn't know how to act around you yet.  If you make an effort to talk to him, he will probably go back to normal.  Hope this helped!|`|qVPYKZUSaa	Guys are difficult to decipher when you don't really know what they are after. If he really likes you, then he is definitely inexperienced  and/or incredibly shy. If he only wants to have sex with you then he is playing the typical macho routine of getting you hooked, keeping you in his radar and adding you to his honey list. He's probably getting some game now, but as soon as he isn't or when  Plan A or B or C don't work, then he will contact you. My advice is, if you like him, don't make yourself too available or don't show too much interest... macho men like this one like to do the huntung.. I strongly recommend tho, that you find somebody worth your while... Guys who play games are immature and are in their sperminating phase. Best of luck, hope it helped!
X9RBRqL2aa	you just are. apparently theyre cool hot chicks. thats normal
CpVt6i9aaa	Definately.  I am 6'1 and my husband 5'6.|`|RbaXxTwkaa	I am medium height and prefer shorter girls, just a personal pref, I love it when there petite, i dont know ifid date a girl who was more then 2-3 inches taller, maybe if she was really cool and had a good personality|`|1vigJEJtaa	Honestly, guys don't mind.  I'm 5'6" and wouldn't mind dating (i have, actually) a taller woman, although I would probably prefer a girl shorter.  Height is usually more of a dealbreaker for the girl than the guy.  Very few guys I know would rule out a girl purely on height.|`|6YPVVsbwaa	not really, guys in general likes to be the taller one in the relationship. it's a male dominance type of thing. in general, short girls like dating tall guys, because they feel like the taller man are more able to protect their short selves.     But these are stereotypes. height is perhaps important to a lot of people as a initial attraction, but what is important is the personalities of the two people and how two people treat each. that will be the great stabilizer.|`|MsSHhX8zaa	It all depends.Some guys have a real problem with dating women taller than themselves...it's an ego thing. Other guys really like it. And some guys are comfortable enough with themselves that they'll date you because they want to, not because of your height.|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	no, they (we) like to stick with girls our height or shorter    at least thats what i do|`|4jx4wAhgaa	I think it doesn't matter whether whose tall or whose short! But if they were to kiss or hug, I think there would be a problem! =D
PLEIYAnAaa	hmm well i don't know if she likes you  but that means she doesn't NOT like you  which is a good start.  so you should show some interest and see if she shows some back.    im a freshman and i don't know how you seniors work :P
jfiRXH8Vaa	Great way to grab attention....you sure got mine. lol  anyway, she's attracted.....take it slow though.|`|cQSojmCJaa	well probably not just because she didnt move. but there could maybe. but se probably felt awkward being squished|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	It could mean either....have to try a few moves - then you will know.|`|YrjxCFXAaa	I don't think so... she probably didn't want to move and didn't want to ask anyone else to move.  you'll only really find out when you ask her.
p6QizgmRaa	We are pretty difficult to please. What we "need" one day may not be what we "need" the following day.  Women are pretty cranky creatures.  We always change our mind.  We usually try to mold you into what we think you should be.    Hopefully the positive makes up for the negative but that's a question our partners would have to answer.|`|encb0jc2aa	wow you are looking for some pretty General answers....to a very Personal question.

Midbg5BJaa	I think it's for a range of factors really.    1. Biologically it's programmed in to men to select women who are able to breed for longer so it makes sense to select a younger female as a mate.    2. Physically- the standard view is that most women will lose their more attractive features as they get older- at the core level I believe it's like factoring in depreciation values.    3. Maturity, women mature faster than me in most aspects so for a 30 year old man, a 25 year old woman will have a lot in common with them in values.    Having said that, I'm 26 and have dated rages of -7 years and +20 years, I don't think you should hold to any rigid rules.    If I was in Oz, I'd probably ask you out on a date so don't worry ;) (or rather do!).|`|J9kxH933aa	probably to manipulate them|`|880810d4326c921557a558c16c9d1c6daa	Most men go out with younger girls for a number of reasons. Generally, women emotionally develop faster than men, so a younger woman would be on a level plane with him. Also, tradition plays a huge role in this long upheld stereotype. Dominance probably also plays a part in the decision, since most men want to be dominant over their partner, thus making them feel more "manly" (for a number of reasons from social establishments to genetic reasons). I'm sure in some men, manipulation plays a role. Also, it depends what the man is looking for. Some men want no attachments, and by dating someone younger, you are less obligated to get married, have a family, etc. Me and my boyfriend are 7years apart. It balances out really nicely, and no one is dominant. We are on a fairly equal plane.|`|gUWcvxzuaa	H---O---T----S----E----X|`|YVRXdfGHaa	I don't know about other guys, but a large percentage of women my age are usually fat, ill tempered, demanding, gray haired, menopausal, and in failing health. So, I'll have to pick one that's at least 10 to 20 years younger, or do without.    I hate to sound harsh, but that's the way I see it.    Sorry ladies, if some of you are offended. You know who you are.|`|sHuC3r8Zaa	if your 25 id say anything from 20-30 is game|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Does it really matter on age to much. It's more there personality and 2 years isn't much difference.|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	It's about control and domination.    Older women usually intimidate young boys.  (And I use the word "boys" purposely.)

82PkTDwwaa	Abuse isn't instigated by 1 thing. It can be lots of different things. Social, financial, mental, past abuse etc.. Most stay thinking (wishing) things will change or the person might change. There maybe children involved or financially they just cannot leave the situation. Some are also threatened with violence if the do leave. Every situation is unique and the answers are dependant on situations. The best outcomes are the ones where the violence stops and the children are safe!

agTCqkLDaa	You're not nuts, you're smart.  I'm not even engaged yet and I'm planning my whole wedding (as much as I can save the actual booking and whatnot) because I want to enjoy my engagement.      I think you should put it in perspective.  Most men understand that the wedding is their soon to be wife's day.  Just hand him a piece of paper and say "look, this is all you have to do" (this should include typical groom stuff such as telling his men to get tuxes, picking out groomsmen, a best man, getting groomsmen gifts, and booking the honeymoon and the groom's cake).  Give him a few months to do the "man" stuff.      Do the bride stuff and ask what he likes and doesn't like.  Give him about 4 months on this.  All the while save.  In 4 months, set a date, see where you've come.  Ask him what he thinks about the colors you picked out and blah blah blah and tell him what you think of the honeymoon.  If he's surprising you let him.    :)|`|Unz3W0EEaa	Maybe you should just ask him what he wants. Possible that he does not want to participate because he wants something different from what you have in mind. Do you see your wedding the same way?|`|77YJU6IYaa	You need to sit down with him with the facts. Show him the books that state when you need to start planning.. Explain how important it is to you. Make sure he knows. Explain after you set the budget, pick the place, and do the guest list. He will be free from wedding plans for a few months. Which is true. Because if he is like most men. The wedding color, flowers, what your bridesmaids will be wearing isn't what he cares about|`|QsbB6vkoaa	i think all guys are this way, and believe me the less involved they are the better.   a wedding is always more special to the bride the groom is just a very important guest.|`|hXRZh7Evaa	What type of questions are you asking?  Time-wise you need to figure out the guest list so you can book ceremony/reception place. That is all you really need to do at the moment. Are you talking about colours, flowers etc? Guys are just not that interested in it when the wedding is so far away.  In future for you I found that my fiance doesn't respond well to 'ideas' but he prefers to actually see a few pictures and then pick from there.  I share most of my planning with my girl friends - and only take the big decisions to the FH when required to.  Good luck.  ps it doesn't mean he doesn't want to marry you - it is just men!|`|O2xwMwHYaa	men dont like the idea of fretting over these types of things. what i did was research everything and narrow down to like 3-5 choices of whatever the issue was, then present them to him. this made my husband very happy because i had a clear image of the budget and type of wedding we wanted. i would try that. you have some time to research and i totally understand the budget thing. give yourself until start of summer to decide on a venue. if you book a venue about 1 year ahead of your date, you will be on schedule. congrats!|`|zqoeLz7Caa	I have the same problem I just remind him that it is his day as much as it is mine. If he is like any guy he would rather skip the wedding and start the honeymoon. If you can't decide on the venue then how will you know what to do for the honeymoon. I am sure he is a great man and he loves you but as big of a deal for you as the ceremony and reception are for you the honeymoon is for him. So you have to think of it like if I get this you will get that. If it makes any sense to you. So tell him the sooner you get this stuff done the sooner he can plan the honeymoon.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	You need to ask him what aspects he does care about. Then have him involved in those things. If he is anything like my fiance, The only thing he is interested in is the food and the honeymoon!|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	The only reason you need to plan this far ahead is if you're banking on a princess wedding extravaganza. Otherwise, reserve the location and start saving money. May 2010 is more than a year away.|`|G50ucmllaa	Are you nuts?  Chill out.  You DO still have time.  But even if you do want to plan now dragging him through the mud and nagging him will do you no good.  Just ask him what he wants to have input on and do the rest yourself.    EDIT- My suggestions still stand.  I have been there.  I was engaged for 3 1/2 years while I finished college to a man who's only request was they not wear pink tuxes.  I promise, you can chill out a bit.|`|DqetlSB6aa	I think you have it easy right now.  Most men don't know what theyre doing.  Leave him be and get a girlfriend to help with the planning.  Seriously you've got it good.  I had a friend who's fiance wanted to be involved...he was so involved I thought he was the bride-it felt like she as marrying a woman.    Reserve a reception hall and the place you want to get married.  The rest can wait a while- maybe 6-9 months before the wedding

PAY58zPNaa	i've never kissed on the first date, but id like to. but ive always wanted my guy to make the first move. like i want him to try and kiss me, and i dont want myself to try and kiss him. you know? if you get what i mean.   it really depends on your girl. ask her friends if she likes kissing, i know that sounds a little weird but it should work.|`|wlvKveAXaa	well first get to kno her be4 u kiss here but i do enjoy kissing.........but not on a first date
b2e454d13dcb8c58423bb1cc2b44f33caa	If you want to ignore him, then do it... he will get over it in time. Ive had it happen to me before, my friends aswell. But thats weird... hes going out with someone and already asking you if you would end up going out with him in 2 months... so maybe hes planning on breaking up with Audrey after awile and go out with you? I think thats just cheesy in a way.     But if you really dont wanna ignore him, then i guess just keep hanging out with him and deal with the fact that he will probably call you all the time if he breaks up with Audrey or starts dating you. Unless you tell him he needs to calm down on the calling/stalking thing (Dont say stalking).    Lol hope that helps.
O9jrkjgraa	You need to tell him you want more than a friendship.|`|wmz7ac7qaa	yeah..  well, if your really meant for each other, destiny na ang bahala!!hehe,toinkZ!!  just continue being friends malay mo di ba, mahal ka pa rin nya..|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	If you ask me, it seems like he's just hurt by how you said you love him in a brotherly way, and upset that you've changed your mind. I bet he probably thinks you are being untruthful, and the chance of him still loving you is very high. Just explain to him that you mistook the truth behind the close bond that you share with him, and distance proved to you that it was truly love. Not brotherly love, but full blown head-over-heels love. Tell him how, when you think of him, you also think of forever. Tell him your regrets. And ask for forgiveness. If he still truly loves you, he will forgive you and let the love happen between the both of you. Good luck. :)|`|nyeUUojFaa	QUEUE BEYONCE-- CRAZY IN LOVE.    just tell him how u feel. he might just be saying he likes u as a sister so u don't feel uncomfortable around him, thinking he feels for u in a more-than-friends way. just tell him, uve got to some day anyway, he probaaby feels the same way as u.|`|cKLrhh1daa	He probably needs time to get over his loss. But it would only work out if he loved you the same way. You need to confront him and tell him how you want it to be. You can't keep something like that in yourself.
ROeq8hkWaa	He's having sex with other girls.  I don't think he sounds nice, if he loved you he wouldn't suggest a break.
FreIeKgVaa	sex only. & never joke about sex with a guy if u want more than sex.|`|258mrT2Paa	probably 3 things one east, one west, one south,|`|E8hYgxN1aa	he is so only after one thing.  i mean how can you not see that.  he got mad when he found out you were kidding about friends with benefits?  ohmygosh.  yeah he isnt looking at you as a girlfriend.  so unless you just want to be friends with benefits i would stay away.|`|aq6z5AF1aa	He is only after one thing.|`|7mrtqwJwaa	I think he cares.|`|tfsaxi0laa	He dumped you and was probably shagging another girl for the 6 to 8 months... she's dumped him and now he's coming back to you.    You're the second prize... so tell him to get lost!|`|tHHHN9RFaa	Ok he likes you thats for sure. but he has to understand if you want to be friends with him thats it. as for you, knowing that hes flirting with you, you should know that he likes you and often you can play around with certain people to get their hopes high, trully i would of got mad. But to answer your question MAYBE its probably to get back at you for what you did as in yes hes probably in it for one thing, or maybe he still has a crush. Only time will tell, if he really wanted what you had with him in the past then he will help you with the situation.
fIeLH6HPaa	Talk to him and let him know that you have wondered what it would be like if the two of you were closer than friends, approach the subject casually. Then if he reacts badly you can pass it off that you were only kidding around. Or you may find out that he feels the same way but was afraid of saying anything to you.
M63kq3AYaa	You don't have a boyfriend problem, you've got a problem with your logic and reasoning.   If this friend was truly a friend, she wouldn't be saying that stuff, so lose her because she has no loyalty or concern for you.    Edit:   If he dumps you over lies, then it's his loss. You've got rid of someone who doesn't trust you and he's lost someone who was being honest.|`|AA11618542	This friend of yours doesn't really seem like a true friend. So maybe you should talk to her and tell her to cut the crap. If she doesn't, then she's not really a true friend, so you should just stop being friends with her for the sake of your relationship with your boyfriend.|`|pX8qJzjIaa	Well that sounds like some classic grade school drama, if the guy likes you a lot, he'll trust you over her.|`|3c93a6700ef8bf8ade1c6ea833102909aa	She's not your friend, for one. Friends don't do stuff like that.    And two, if he likes you, and your in a some-what healthy realtionship, he's not going to do anything.    Ignore her. And don't badger him about her.|`|07BGuApWaa	chicks before dicks.|`|m6P9BNWFaa	OMG one of my best friends is in that exact same position right now, except her and her boyfriend are the same age. i'll tell you what i told her: this girl is NOT your friend. a real friend wouldn't hit on your boyfriend and try to get him to break up with you. your boyfriend seems like a good guy, so i wouldn't worry about losing him to your friend. but i think you should confront your friend about this, and if she doesn't change anything then stop hanging out with her. maybe if you're lucky, she'll realize that the friendship you two have is more important than this guy and come back to apologize.|`|ZsEBqBYvaa	hello.. why not try to talk to ur boyfriend... also u may learn if ur boyfriend is really sincere to u even somebody else talks craps about u.. den u may also talk to ur friend.|`|a8c86432a8a5add7fcbf2436c1c53a6daa	haha yeah im 13 nd my boyfriend is 16 and he trusts me so much and i trust him. if he trusts you.. nothing can stop you to. but if this girl is your "friend" she wouldnt be telling lies.|`|AA11032806	She's not your friend then. If she would be, she woudn't be telling these horrible lies.|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	First off i think that you should talk to this so called "friend" because if she was a friend regardless if she likes/loves him or not you are still her friend and she should respect that and not do what she's doing to you and if the guy really likes you then he wont believe the crap she's telling him anyways speak with him about this as well it sounds like this friend of yours is suffering from pure jealousy|`|6y8xbiwGaa	thats where u have to think for yourself.  your young u learn from ur mistakes, and choices.|`|1UVLarLgaa	tell him that your "friend" is a frigit zebra and that'll you'll do (f*u*c*k) him in the bush at school.|`|bc5ed6323d790f88be7de8afaff7d20caa	That is not your "friend",you know that too,otherwise you wouldnt have quoted it.Friends dont do each other like that|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	I agree with the person who said 'chicks before dicks'--but not this time.  Not if she's trying to fill his head with lies.  What do you need a friend like that for?|`|stv1JMXNaa	Honestly, if your friend is doing that, then she isn't a real friend. Talk to her and tell her if she was a real friend she wouldn't make crap up about you so that your boyfriend would break up with you. Then talk to your boyfriend. Tell him what's going on, and tell him she wants to be with him so she's trying to break you guys up. Hopefully he is an understand guy and not a jerk like most guys. I hope everything goes well with you guys,|`|wE2etBzbaa	I don't have a boyfriend problem, I'm a straight man     hopefully that answered your question|`|CU1WRghVaa	She isn't a true friend she betray you already just ditch her there is so many friends you can find.
aC9dBaNqaa	if you have questions then you should ask him if your starting to develop feelings for him in that type of way then you should ask him where are the two of you exactly in this relationship|`|dGBbFwFWaa	it doesnt really sound like there is commitment between you two..  maybe he just dont feel there is a relationship and therfore feels he doesnt have to communicate will u as in where he goes or what he does.. i think its best u ask him where u two are standing how what expectaions u have for him and what u can also give in return.. good communication always works.. good luck|`|lpOKbiYSaa	i would probably just ask him,  it doesnt hurt to ask :)  jusst ask him like if he really likes you and stuff.  and if he is seeing someone else!  hope that helped a bit.|`|HmPZnO4naa	yes that is definately your buisness. you should know if he is stringing you along. but not where he is going just ask him if he is seeing anyone. where he is going should be let known only if he wants it to|`|87KMkWLuaa	i would ask but he loves u why would he like anyone he has a lovely women
h6NqNzHAaa	You can move on and ignore her if you want to, but if you really like her, being her friend is one step away from dating in the future.|`|oy1xeBMCaa	im having the same problem as we speak.. i really like this girl to but im not a quit like u. Im going to continue talking  to her and hopefully things will change.. Sometimes girls become attracted to you after u tell them how u feel dude|`|wlvKveAXaa	idk
6GUpUXoXaa	Sorry but what a loser (him not you)  I have two kids and i don't care how honest i am being i would never swear on the lives of my children.     If you see him throwing the same lines to other girls then he really isn't worth it... that just happened to a friend of mine he would make her feel completely special and then she found out that he was hanging out with other girls ... and by other girls i mean individually and sexually.      If i were you i'd look for someone else why would you be with someone who says stuff to make you feel special but hes saying the same words to 287392 other people!|`|rOeUOFZOaa	He's a player keeping his options open.    But he's also deceiving you and lying.  Drop his sorry good for nothing ***.    Plus he's already had kids and screwed up that relationship.... he's a deadbeat.|`|Ar3yyyvCaa	do eye contact|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Listen honey, this guy is not for you.He has obviously been there, done that and now he is attached to his moment of glory until he / she is 18 years old.     I don't know how old either of you are, or the things he promised to do with you later. But from what you've posted you cannot rely on anything he promises you, now or later. He's lying to you about being together when he gets the car. Common sense say's if you care for and want to be with someone, having a car will not benefit or hinder you.    The fact you have seen him on line promising other girls the same thing should have sent red flags to your  head and up your skirt.  If you allow him to get to either of those places,after the way he treats you, then you'll deserve what you get.    My advise is to severe your ties with this guy, and do it by phone, he doesn't deserve to see you again.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|a7vxbnBZaa	34343|`|AWiM2aMhaa	yeah that really doesn't sound like someone you want to waste your time with, but if you really like him alot go ahead and play it out and see what happens, most likely when you meet up with him it'll be really obvious whether he's lying or not...|`|0vhx7Putaa	From the way you stated your question I would assume you're what 15?  "also he promised that he would do other things with me." What does that mean? Be careful, don't let yourself think just because he is here know that he is right for you. Doesn't sound like a good guy to me.|`|wNR72Ngkaa	he's the one for you! tell him you'll b his little **** doll n spread your legs, when you start popping out babies and find out u & ur children have STDs, and u never hear from this player again, you'll sit back n say "im so glad I asked a bunch of random people I don't know online about such an important situation" trust me... ... .. . kids...|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Be what  you  choose to have.and this will secure the way of your life.  A man just because he wants to be with other womens altogether is a bad guy.When age picks up you would understand well good luck.|`|JZkCVHJAaa	seems a little shady if he's saying that stuff to other women
ou3TcHdmaa	wow this is exactly what is happening with one of my friends! (she would be in the same position as you) and i would be in group A    ..okay so the reason why we were getting mad @ her was because we felt like we were losing her as a friend, and it felt like she was ditching us for a new group, so i guess you could say we were a bit jealous of her new friends    we finally just told her what we were thinking and now everythings is completely cool because we know that she isnt ditching us, she just wants to hang out with other ppl sometimes.. you just need to tell your friends that, and eventually everything will turn out good for you    lol sorry for this being so long, but i hope it helped :)|`|th1qH0Mwaa	alright. so i get it. uhm. i think you should just take a breath and calm down. think about who your real friends truely are. you should just tell your friends that they should accept the fact that both of the groups are your friends and if they cant accept that, then they're not your friends. ideekay what else to say. chat with me, and then i can tell you more. i guesh! sorry im not much help :||`|76nTvO4iaa	Would it work if you ate lunch with Group A on M-W-F and Group B on T-Th?  That way, neither group will feel like you're ditching them during lunch for the other group.|`|1dNZb7Y4aa	hun, that is OBSURD.  you can be friends with WHOEVER u want, why does it matter SO much?  i mean really darling, all you really have to do is just figure out who ur true friends are.  some of the girls from "group a" sound like they arent very nice for saying they dont like the people in "group b"  it is GOOD to hang out with all sorts of people, its good for your social skills in the real world.  just remember, if they were REALLY ur friends they would not CARE who the heck u hang with.  sounds like ur more CLOSE with group a tho but yet they are sorta bashing u by saying u changed.   so, take this WHOLE think as an oppurtunity to just figure out ur true friends.  good luck.
jAGwyyuyaa	It could be. Or it could be the x is going to find something else to bring up, costing the x more money. If I were him, I'd agree to the fee's if she will go ahead and end it. If not, I wouldn't pay a dime.|`|5k7BexD3aa	That doesn't mean it's ending.  That means that the lawyers are tired of it dragging out and are worried about getting their $$$.  Why has a divorce taken that long?  That's ridiculous.
yEDR0fnOaa	Definitely hug her. Put your hand on the back of her head. Gently pull put her head on your shoulder. Hold her close and support her emotionally. She will always be greatful to you for it.|`|fxxLgQrdaa	yea girls like hugs|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	hold her to your chest and kiss her on the forehead. but yes, she will want you to hug her or do something|`|ziiYVYXZaa	yes!  women love gentle-men, any gentle touch is probably well needed at this point|`|9RajlJpRaa	yes you should always offer attention, even if she acts like she doesnt want it. she probly wont admit it, but if you hug her she will love it. espcially if she is crying or mad at you.|`|9dQo0qGaaa	YESS!  ofcourse!! girls ALWAYS love a hug,  especially when they are upset and its from  her boyfriend..ABSOLUTLY!!  :]]|`|J2uxLxDPaa	yup, hugs heal!|`|cl1pJK38aa	Absolutely.|`|79HsIfeIaa	yes|`|f30a506a8cabe4e06fa0380441990cb2aa	MOST definitely. it will make her feel cared for .|`|lOS08DBsaa	YES !|`|ACm3QAFmaa	If she starts crying, then rub her back gently. If she pushes your hand away, then leave her be until she is able to cool off. Then you go in for the hug and tell her comforting things. That'd be so sweet. :)|`|NuGVVrDxaa	It depends on what she is emotional about.  But in general you hug her, hold her hand, whatever to prove to her that you are surportive of her feelings, and that you are there for her.
XjtUVlCWaa	short answer, to keep her a virgin until marriage, then to keep her sexually active only with her husband.  In some cultures, it means NO contact with any male other than her husband or family members that are male|`|AoUUFdTSaa	its like protecting her virginity like a chasity ring which means that she is committed to only have sex after she is married|`|kpJrsuNHaa	It usually for the girls own good no guy wants a girl who has sleept with half the town u know  It also helps the girl stay pure, clean|`|7KhwZN2daa	That would be your virginity. Guard it for youre life..|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Usually it means to keep her a virgin.|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	it means your virginity. your womenhood... to not have Se* until marriage,through that protection...|`|DrUBOBabaa	Its virginity.

KMASS2Gmaa	Yes it can work well. My mother was 13 years younger than my dad and they were married 59 years and happy every minute of it. The only problem was when he died she just quit wanting to live. She got to be an old lady in about 2 weeks. So sad because before that she was more like little sister always getting me in trouble like taking up Scuba diving when she was 61. LOL
UJ2bDHeeaa	thin but not skinny.  i don't prefer fat at all.  height-weight proportionate is more than acceptable.|`|kMLaynNWaa	ALL MEN HAVE DIFFRENT TASTE SO IT ALL DIFFRENT SOME LIKE TINY LITTLE THINGS AND SOME LIKE CURVY|`|jPLiMCPDaa	Not fat, but chubby is good.  Here are a couple reasons, like them or not:    1) Sex with skinny girls can be painful  2) Heavy girls don't typically cheat and take off as long as you treat them right  3) Heavy girls are usually more willing to do wilder things|`|hHKagR8Zaa	Skinny normal girls!|`|WB8uBODtaa	please noo chubby :(.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	cosmo says you're fat  but I aint down wit that|`|dfwi5rClaa	i dont think any of that matters.    if the girl is at peace within herself, she's beautiful in my book at least|`|ptclgKl5aa	I'd prefer them to be slightly skinny, but I'd rather have too skinny than chubby.  Toned women are hot too.
R5eXmRo3aa	What the?...     If she is your step dad's step brother's wife's daughter, that only means she is part of your "closed off" family.    GO for it? She isn't even in your family tree, expect the married part, which doesn't mean anything, she is just in your family. Not part of it, there is nothing wrong with dating like your third cousin, because she isn't even pat of the bloodline, you know what I mean?    Tell her you do kind of feel awkward about it, and she'll say the same. But you both like each other, so go for it, but what I would suggest is telling both families what is going to go on, because it basically like a co-workers dating each other.    If you screw up with each other, who's going to be fighting? So be careful, make sure your families know you both are "somewhat" related, and are dating/going out. Make sure if you do break it off with each other, that it is done on good terms, or there may be a feud with both families, ya know?    Best of luck, slowly talk to each other, communication is key, tell her how you really feel, and that you don't care about the circumstances, and just go for it!|`|	If you like her go for her. Who cares shes not like your CLOSE cousin.|`|	she isn't blood related and she is distant so go for her. i don't really know if that helps. :S|`|	I think you NEED to find out for sure if she is your cousin and then worry. because if shes not ur giving ur self grey hair for nothing.|`|	I think your worrying way too early, and if she's not blood related then that's not too big a deal, if you really like her then you should go for it
OUDXDNBLaa	Find out what the girl likes and find out as much as you can about the subject, then when you approach her you'll at least be able to hold a decent conversation.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	you don't have to talk about common interests... you can talk about other stuff like school and stuff.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Its always good to get some background info on the girl you want to approach or have general knowledge of what her friends like to do. That way when you talk to her, you'll have something to say other than guy stuff. Ask a friend of hers that you may know and see what kind of things interest her.|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	might not answer your question but here's a few tips       1. Be Yourself. If you try to act all macho when you're not, you are telling the girl, "I'm such a bad person that I have to pretend to be a better one." That is probably not true. Loosen up and let this girl see how you really are.     2. Smile. This can help a lot. It shows that you are enjoying the conversation and that you feel comfortable, which will make the girl continue talking with you.     3. Bring something up but don't seem too obvious about liking them. When you talk just be yourself, then you can see if the girl likes you for who you really are.     4. Look in her eyes and be serious and not desperate. But if she looks away don't try it again. When she looks away, it's sometimes her way of saying "oh great, I don't like you, but how can I be nice about it". Most likely, she's just nervous. Which is good! It means that she likes you back.     5. Be interested in her opinions and thoughts on different subjects. Listen intently when she speaks. Girls like guys that listen to them and like what they say. Don't constantly interrupt her, let her talk and share thoughts with you.     6. Comment on her sense of humor, good taste in music, or prowess on the dance floor. It's all right to compliment her clothes, hair, jewelry, etc., but you'll really win a girl's heart if she sees that you're into more than just her outside.     7. Don't tell girls &dash; for that matter, anyone at all &dash; they have a flaw unless you are obviously poking fun at them, even then only if you know they can take a joke, and know you well enough to know how to react to your teasing. Otherwise you risk putting them off.     8. Be funny. If you can make her laugh, you've as good as got her number then and there.     9. Don't try too hard. Girls will see you as needy and will not be attracted to you.    10. Be confident in yourself and don't be afraid of saying something stupid. If you're not afraid then you probably won't. If you have been friends with her for years, and are comfortable talking pretend you are just talking to her about another girl you like.    11. Make her laugh. Tell her you like her ear rings for example. Maybe if you are sitting next to her you could put an arm around the chair or something. If she clearly does not want you... give up. You will be made fun of by every single girl if she doesn't like you and dumps you in front of everyone. If you want to ask her out,do it in private, people spread rumors.|`|OLpWRv2uaa	talk about fish oil. that's what I do.. But I end up usually just getting other guys, oh well.|`|m2YuRw7Vaa	Tell her how much you like her, get her number and talk to her over the phone.

0fVtHNtmaa	At this point, you're going to HAVE to hurt her feelings.  Either that or move to a different city.|`|5Azscj72aa	The most effective method is to tell her privately that you do not like her. Don't ignore her, it won't work. Say "Hey, we need to talk. I don't like you in any way more than just friends." Tell her you have a girlfriend or that you are in love with someone else from a different school.|`|xEyByCxwaa	stop talking about urself

3N2ElzcQaa	Um...speechless here. So, what should I say?    First off, you're very open on this, but gosh, its like you told me your whole live story to me in person.    Well, to answer your question, competition is neither healthy or unhealthy. It goes both ways, depending on the situation.     You lived your life differently than R's did, but could you be a little supportive of him? I mean, it sounds like he didn't have any support at all. He sounds kinda alone for some reason, and the whole 'having-sex-with-an-older-adult' thing was very wrong of him to commit, and an online dude that he haven't met either. R is really...explorative about the whole gay thing, but its like being straight or bi. Its dangerous. But, I'm glad that you had to be angry with him about it. That's part of being supportive.    And, your situation with R was really more on the dirty competition side.|`|O9jrkjgraa	Yes.

v1Ujni1Daa	Things you should take into consideration:  -Look how does he relate with girls. Is he flirty all the time? However, it seems as you don't see him often, so I don't think you can take this into account.  -How much did you know yourselves before? Where you good friends? Did you like each other before?    None of this is a 100% safe indicator, but these things could be useful for you. But don't be nervous. Just flirt with him some more time. You'll never know if he likes you if you don't try to find out by responding. Go for it! What's the worse thing that could happen?  Just, as always, be sure to put limits with guys, don't let them do anything to you they shouldn't be doing. If you do this, you'll be fine. ;)  I know one gets excited when someone seems to like one. Yeah I know it's really cool. Just be sure to respond only if you like him too. Remember, you'll lose nothing! And don't be nervous. If he does like you, it's for some reason!|`|q0Z6vSyBaa	Well...if you do like him be yourself! He seems to enjoy it! Wear something cute! Just go about as if it was normal tho. Don't be too flirty or anything.|`|zxAICk2Caa	maybe go for it
r3LI6mKhaa	Yeah, I agree that is a good idea for you to just drive his stuff because everything would fit right and all. Like, he shouldn't cause you the trouble of you having to drive an hour and picked them up then drive back then later drive them back when they're all stoned. I'm sure he said it was expensive because he feels as if you did break it, you'd feel bad but if he drove it and if it did get damaged it'd be his fault and not yours. You should tell him that you don't want to waste hella gas driving an hour and driving back. That's like 4 hours total. And especially how your mom will also be in the car while his friends are there. I'm sure it's not a "trust" issue that he doesn't trust you with his equipment. But like just having it by his side that he know forsure it will be there on time and what not. just compromise|`|fSQfmCUbaa	i understand where you are both coming from  i think he just means that YOU personally wont mess up his things but on accident something could happen to his things and he  would rather just avoid it|`|UThG15FLaa	truthfully,  His band Equipment is obviously very expensive.  I can't say he doesn't trust you, but on the other hand, im sure he doesn't want anything to happen to his band Equipment either.    But in my opinion, he shouldn't put you on the spot.  you also have to drive your mother to the concert, and for him to even think of asking you to drive his friends (stoned and drunk) is an awful idea.    ? DEEE|`|uKkCXbFzaa	He's a guy and guy's get very attached to their "toys". You shouldn't take it personally, but he was being a bit of an ***. If something like this happens again you should mention that it upsets you, but for now let it go.|`|CKWABfYIaa	tell him how you feel because if not he may get used to treating to treating u like that.|`|NOYOgHIEaa	hes just being overprotecive (trust me i know) its not that he doesnt trust u hes just being himself... dont make it a problem when there is no problem. he'd take it the wrong way
71VRvldJaa	You answered your own question!  They don't want advice....they want reassurance!
OwfoyXpraa	well he might get upset.. a lot of guys assume that when you don't answer them it's a "no". Keep talking to him, and being his friend though. (: If you feel that it's awkward, just talk to him casually about the stuff you would have normally talked about with him if he hadn't asked you.    Hun, you shouldn't be embarrassed if you go out with him. (: I know, it's not really something you can choose, but if you really want to, why not go out with him? You might actually like him a lot more than you think. (: If it doesn't work out, well, atleast then you'll know what you would've been missing, eh?    Oh and if people DO give you two a hard time, just be like, "Yeah, so what if we're going out? What difference does that make to you?"  Really, your personal life is none of their business.  Don't let them hold you back. (:    Good luck hun. :)|`|71LeWL4waa	yes kinda gets ancty or w/e take your time most boys will w8 for ever...|`|c4BPvxz9aa	i think hes definetly thinking u dont like him because it took a lot for him to build up the courage to do that its prolly driving him crazy its always akward when 2 ppl date at first but if u like him it shouldnt matter u 2 will get more comfortable with eachother as time goes by i think u should say yes|`|IRRO0vOnaa	he wont get mad just dont wait to long and if u like him u like himm if u dont ask if u can still be friends trust me it has happened to me before!!!|`|UBisFL1taa	You should have at least said something to the poor guy.  If you're going to be embarrassed to be seen with him, then your not ready for a relationship because somebody is always going to say something.    And I think he might be afraid that you don't like him and that you're just going to reject him.  If you do reject him, then try and be nice about it.|`|OpQEREm6aa	well like it wont really mean that yuu dun like him  like he well be like "does she like or did i get her to feel alil akward"  just asnwer him  and its normal to walk up to him and nothin to say  it happened to me tons of times  but just be like "hey whats up"  and start a convo  its normal  and could yuu help me with mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	who cares! say yes! don't care what people think! if you say no your missing out on a chance of life! GO OUT WITH HIM!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	If I asked out a girl and if she didn't reply me back, I would get a little bit offended.  It's yes or no.  If she said no, I tried my best and find another girl who can make me happy.|`|8O4ttgGMaa	just say you're not wanting a b/f. (even if you are) lol. its the easiest way to say no|`|SWekdgrhaa	yah that's definitely a blow to his confidence. Answer him right away if you want to keep him as a friend!|`|AA10025781	guys can get really offended if you dont respond. even more so then if you were to say no. i had a really good friend when i was in eighth grade that out of the blue asked me to this upcoming high school dance that was open to the middle school and i just stood there with my mouth wide open, my face all red and said "ummm" he said never mind and walked off. we didnt talk for at least 2 months. if you like him, say yes and see how it goes. just think about how you feel and go with that. your feeling about him is all that matters when it comes to your decison. good luck.|`|C3tVKFWuaa	If your really like him just say yes. When people say like "ohhh, you two are going out" just say "atleast  i have a  boyfriend" Then glare. Just be your self and try to act normal. And when people are your real friends they wil lnto do that. Just try to act calm. Then when people make fun of you, just go along with it. Just be liek "Yeah we are going out Got a prob with that?" then just stick your head up high and everything! lol

xTwWM6UFaa	Getting felt up can mean a lot of things,   first time is normally outside the clothes, and generally on your chest.  second or third time they'll prob get the courage to go under your shirt, and fifth or sixth (depending on the guy of course, mine have been a little quicker) theyll go under the bra.  I don't regret it, the guys don't go around bragging, and they get a kick out of it, and its not uncomfortable unless they have cold hands, which you can easily tell them, and help em warm them up ;)  have fun!|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	likke when a guy says, "I felt her up" It means that he fingered her.  Yeah i have and i enjoy it in the moment but regret it in the morning.|`|ev3EwV2laa	he just touches your body so he can get "excited"|`|kFzYAlJAaa	like  when you're making out and  he gropes your boobs...yea the first  time it was kinda  awkward  but i think its just cause i was  too  immature  for it,,,no  regrets though!|`|7vIMWN0Maa	I'm gay! and I love it!|`|dvuttL6Taa	lol..like how old are you..? anyway, 'getting felt up'..is simply as it sounds...he feels you up..particularly you erogenous zones|`|c3e013ae9f93186405957f1d64999301aa	What it means that the person actually touches a personal area of another person. It can be done by a guy to a girl, a girl to a guy or between the same sex.   Does it feel good? it depends how you feel about the person who is doing it. It can be very disturbing if you don't allow to do it. It actually considered to be a type of rape.     Some people would define "Feel up" as an insertion of a finger to someone's vagina, but most defines it only as a touch to feel something that is taboo to most.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	It varies. It might be touching the breasts or genitalia outside clothing or inside. I think it is easy to say the girls/women who have it done to them find it exciting. If they do not like it then they stop it, either worth words or actions.  Of course some guys are animalistic and do not stop.  Are you sure your question is real or or are you just asking to get a rise out of us?|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Grabbed, groped, petted or squeezed in a sexual way.|`|0NQL7yRPaa	he feels ur *** and boobs|`|St0bKidyaa	It means when a guy grabs your butt, boobs, inc.|`|ehmeG65gaa	i guess to grab or grope in a sexual manner, i have, and i like it, well once i didn't, but i just punched him.|`|O1WxKk7uaa	When he feels up on you.

Well maybe you should listen to some fast umm funny music :S.. dunno im not good at making peoples happy. anywayz hope i helped you out.|`|89cCKrm8aa	you can messege her using yahoo messenger, and just talk and stuff|`|nyeUUojFaa	ok seriously, COME TO AUSTRALIA ITS THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. then u can see her as much as u want :)    o but really u can talk on msn, send emails and stuf.. yeh do as much as u can to keep in touch.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	You are lucky because you can  come here for a holiday to visit her now.

MJALNawOaa	Do not have sex with these other girls. You say you love your gf so show it by fighting these temptations. These other girls are absolutely not good for you. Get away from them and avoid them at all costs. Also, get some professional help. There are support groups, or counselors who can help you work through this addiction. Believe me, if you cheat and your gf finds out, she will not be saying "Oh you poor thing, your addiction was just to strong for you. I'm sorry it was so hard."     Get away from the temptation.  Get help.  Get yourself healthy.    Good luck. If you love her, you will do this and it will be so worth it! :)|`|MxOURY0Gaa	YOU NEED JESUS! ahaa.  no seriously, just straight up tell her.

I mean, i guess you can practice or something. But you shouldn't choose girlfriends who give the best sex. Girls who give the best sex probably have slept with other guys to get all good and what not. I mean, holding onto this relationship should be better than just sex.|`|S3zjidNyaa	dont give in, if you love her then dont do anything to mess things up. When someone cheats on you it ruins trust and that is the most inportant thing in a relationship.|`|nHi1mioBaa	yes i dont know what it like to be a sex addict  but if you love ur gf,you have to control yourself  dont hurt the girl feeling  you must control yourself   and i think you should talk to ur gf about this|`|UDKLeWd2aa	well listen i would suggest you talk to your girlfriend about this, she mite help you better and since you are talking about this with her, her trust and love for you will increase and that mite motivate you to just be with your girlfriend and you should be able to stay away from those other girls, i hoped i helped, good luck man|`|5ekdVDQXaa	talk to a shrink
encb0jc2aa	well You might want to try the library|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Also, try locating the nearest women's shelter - they'll generally have resources available to help people with financial issues and divorce.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Try the nearest law school and/or legal aid society.
xccRugjHaa	The touching puts it past pure friendship.  Guys usually won't try to touch a woman unless they are interested in them as more than a friend.|`|x09r4OVdaa	I think he likes you. C'mon! All the things he does are signs of major flirting. I would go for it and ask him if he likes you or not. From what I can tell, he likes you more than just a friend.    Hope I helped! :)  ?Bri
abz98b8Vaa	ist?|`|dsiuzvTHaa	i no too
EdnENZ1daa	Ok, I think I have the answer to your question. I have seen this numerous times, I've been through it myself and I even studied it in school. The reason why he is acting this way comes down to 2 words : emotional imaturity. Everything is always great in the begining of a relationship because of the ''passion'' but it seems like passion tends to fade after 3 years. Now, depending on their age, the person will either look to find that passion again, if not then break up. Or, being mature, they will realise that a relationship needs to be nurtured and let their feelings develop into something deeper... ''real love''. So.. if your boyfriend is between 16-18..in some cases even 20.. then chances are he's not getting it yet.. He still has feelings for you but just isn't as ''excited as he used to be'' about you. Girls are more mature than guys and understand that relationships change but guys are different. I can tell you one thing though: if he leaves you, he'll probably come back. Just let him know that if he decides to leave you and goes for another girl, the same thing's bound to happen again.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	You need to read the book "He's Just Not That Into You".  Because baby, he's just not that into you, and you need to accept it, stop asking questions, and move on.|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Things happen weird now days, anyway it looks like that he must have lost interest in you overtime and this its possible 3 YEARS is something very long most probably things might go apart.    Its something a miss here  that you're not with other new touch.    Anyway you can try to check it out yourself.with him maybe with a call or something and confirm things out and move on.|`|CZdFWit7aa	I like to believe that true love never dies. SO if he really loved you. Then he would always have some sort of love for you. It just may not be as strong as it was before. But I think you should do for yourself right now and get your self esteem up and focus on him later.   I'm kind of in the same situation with my baby's father.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	If someone loves you they wouldn't be hurting you|`|XIP7jDSPaa	he may still have some feelings for you but overall he is just trying to let go without a big fuss.  you sound just like my friend and her boyfriend.  they were together for about 3 years and just suddenly broke up too.  he said he still loved her but at the same time he was trying to let go.  so... i think its better that you dont get back together with someone who is so unsure with your relationship.|`|J2uxLxDPaa	Look, everyone might go through this, you're not the only one. If you two broke up, there should be a reason, if it's just that he fell out of love for you, then why does he only have it when you two are in private? If he does like... love you then he should have it in public as much as in private. He even told you he didn't like you. what you do is your choice but things can change at a snap.You have to realize that...    Good Luck!|`|4NKoOPIMaa	well guys are very different from girls they don't act how we do when we break up with someone we love. girls get all emotional. he's still got love for you and loves you but he might to hurt to show it to you. they sometimes feel they are the stronger sex when in all actuality we are. don't really worry about. just worry about you right now and do for yourself. you probably shouldn't be with someone like that anyway..good luck ma|`|MSxneEXkaa	well i will say that i did a few years in prison and love does not go away as long as you live will you be in love is another story now we broke upm and she was with another vman i styill mhad that love for vher so mill say from my exp nyes there can still be love after three years and to the question aboutsticking around no one could answer that but u if it makes you happy go for it gyrl because people talk anyway its what you guys want now are you currently physical with him or you just talk  chances are he still loves you if he trys to act hard cuz hesnhiding whaet he truly feels soft esp nwhen it comes to nwomen men also nget hard because they feel threatened by something that he cant explain that has to do with you just ask him and see where it goes
9HoXpsP6aa	I don't know how old you are, but I'm guessing a teenager...  a teenager who shouldn't be having to worry about things like this, so I'm sorry you have all this pressure on you.  Parents don't get along for many different reasons.  It sounds like you're dad is SEVERELY depressed, and does need help.   Luckily, they've started going to therapy.  I know you said it doesn't seem to be helping, but being an adult isn't easy.  You have to worry about money, love (or the lack of love) understanding, supporting your family, so don't think that this started because you were born.  You were born, yes.  But your parents are the ones who chose to quit 'trying'  to make it work with eachother, and that's not your fault you were brought to this earth.  Even though you say you're the only one your dad has to talk to doesn't give him the right to tell you he wants to commit suicide, but I know that you are worried even if you don't really like him for treating you bad.  And if your dad is stressed b/c he can't see his son b/c of what he 'did to you', it sounds to me like he may have molested you or done something really bad, and out of respect for you doesn't see his son because it would be wrong to bring him into your home if he's hurt you in this way.  It sounds like your dad is really, really lonely, and when your parents don't even get along, he probably doesn't feel like he has anyone to talk to since his best friend did die.  This is so hard to deal with, especially since he feels like he can't even go to your mom.  Maybe talk to your parents and let them know how upset and worried about this you are.  Tell your dad you care about him and how much it hurts you when he says he wants to die, because it's obvious you're very concerned about this.  Ask him if he realizes how much it would hurt You to come home and find something like that.  I'm sure your mom yelled at him because she is trying to protect you.  She knows he shouldn't be telling you things like this, and he shouldn't.  Have you talked to your parents about maybe going to counseling also?  Maybe it would be a good way for you to also sort out some of the confusing feelings this whole situations might be giving you.      I know, this is a long answer....|`|DLPT2dejaa	LIFE IS HARD SOMETIMES AND YOU WANT TO BE THE BIGGER PERSON AND TRY TO FIX IT.

MsSHhX8zaa	Just ask her.    Or when you're hanging out one day just tell her that you have so much fun together, the only thing that would make it better would be if you could say she was your girlfriend. It is kinda cheesy, but it's cute and it works.|`|x09r4OVdaa	Honestly? Go up to her, and just ask her. It may be nerve-wracking, but at least you're being to the point.    Don't have a friend do it, though. She'll think you're too scared to do it yourself. Just go up to her, smile, and say, "I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?" But, make sure she's not around her friends; trust me. She'll just giggle and roll her eyes. That's what happened whenever one of my friends asked out this girl.    Anyways, this was is the best way.    Hope I helped :)  XX, Bri |`|T0WhXvqwaa	when me and my boyfriend started to hang out, i could tell that we were going to end up dating. I was just really nervous about actually asking him out. But im super impatient and he is really shy, so i knew I would have to be the one to ask. So one night, when we were watching a movie, i grabbed his hand to hold, really casually. and then when the movie was over, i looked at him and gave him a quick kiss (just a small little one).   He actually leaned in and gave me a deeper more meaningful kiss. After he left, i sent him a little text message saying "when do i get to tell people that i have the greatest boyfriend?" he quickly responded "as soon as you would like!!!"     It was a really cool and casual way without being too obnoxious or cheezy.|`|AA12108398	tell her you've been thinking-take her hand-and tell her you want something more serious. tell her you don't want to pressure her.

3PlT64Yuaa	Your dad has cancer and your mom is working her *** off to support the family in his place. Now, you're thinking about joining a gang so you can slap your hardworking mother and your helpless father in the face?    Wake the hell up, man. Get back to your senses. Gangs offer a sense of family, sure. But in return, you are expected to get into a life of violence, crime, and drugs.     You may be hurting from not seeing your mother, and your father's ill-state probably isn't helping either, but don't be selfish and try to only satisfy your needs by joining a gang. Your whole family is going through a crisis right now, not just you, don't wimp out.    I really hope that you change your mind about joining a gang. I'm trying to save you from making one of the worst mistakes in your life that you will regret until the day you die. Don't make me think that I wasted my time on you.    Having friends is fine, but just choose them wisely.|`|ga95mWTUaa	umm it depeneds..are they in a gang? do they do violent things? steal, jump people, drugs? all that stuff. if they do then know dont hangout with them because that's just making things worse for you. but if they just dress urban than sure why not? if they make you happy than go for it..you can talk to them about it and see if they will help you. but try talking to your "non" gangster friends? maybe they can help you out. if they are in a gang than making you happy is what they want so you could be part of that and you dont want that because that is more of a risk for you getting into trouble. Be there for you dad, be the better man and help him out, support him. your going through a rough time man. talk to your mom about it. you gotta talk to someone at least. who knows maybe a lucky girl will fall right in and you can talk to her about it you know.|`|rVPT2tx1aa	well reassure your mom nothing is going to happen. and stay with your friends as long as they make you feel better. thats what friends are for after all. Don't worry about it. a little help in return please?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Surely there are other people you can be friends with. At this stressful time in your parent's life, what if something happened to you because of these gangster friends ? think about that and find new friends. And stop giving your mom something else to worry about, she has enough on her plate.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	As long as they help you be happy, stick with them. That is, unless they start leading you to cause trouble and do stupid things. As long as your friendship with them is harmless, I think that you may continue to hang out with them. Also, explain to your mom that your change in attitude has nothing to do with your friends, and everything to do with the current hardships you're enduring. Good luck. :)|`|nfn01Xsfaa	um.. yes u are going through a hard time. and im glad u realise that.    so u can give urself some slack..    about ur "attitude change"    do u notice it? if you are.. are you trying to be concsiously rude to your mom? if not, you and your mom should be okay.    just stay polite and respectful to her and she'll stop commenting.    if u feel better with them, than why not? if u feel happy with them, then stay with them. maybe u can share some of your feelings (bout ur dad) and stuff with them, (if u can) and get support from them.    its YOUR life and not your mom's. ur mom cares about you, but soemtimes mom doesnt always know what is best aobut their kid when the kid gets older.    i know u want to do better in school, so DO better.    study more and whatnot.    u have to be more strict and disciplined  withurself.    thers a saying, "just because ur firends go jump off a cliff, ar eu going to jump too?"    if they do stuff u dont like, u dont have to do it. period.    -----  by the way, i hope u dont mean "gangsteR" like on the streets selling drugs type and getting into violence..    u should have some MORe COMMON SENSE to NOT do that, if u were not like that before.    just use ur common sense. is th is good for me, or bad for me?    and also.. if u mean gangster as in just poeple who skip school and smoke and occasional drug, thats ok.|`|VLRkJOOuaa	"Turn into a gangster," as you put it. (:    I think this might be a coping mechanism, but it's not as negative as the other ones people build; cutting, etc. Go right ahead; if they accept you, that's pretty much all that matters. You're obviously needing some attention.|`|jGgRF3Yjaa	stop hanging out with them. even u say ur change in attitude nothing to do with ur new friend but it is! u can find other friend, not a gangster one to cheer u up. to make u feel less alone, try to involve in curriculum's activity at school.
6J8sHGRIaa	Hmmmm.... first off... i think we all know what crush means.. its an admiration towards someone... either a celebrity, a player, or even your classmate or schoolmate! It's either you like him 'cause he/she is smart, he or she is good at something... or just like everyone else.. 'cause of his/her cuteness!    i know we all want our crushes to like us just the way we are, right? and to notice us or at least to know that we exist in this chaotic world! or even know our first name...    and we kept glancing at him or her every time we have a chance... but has he or she ever caught you looking? *smiles* wooohoooo!    and when you see him or her.. you blush and do that "guppy effect" (it means you tingle! haha)    okay these are the ways.. i've gathered it up! and i think it really helps! only if your crush is at the campus... haha...    1. Have eye contact! but! don't make it too obvious.. :D    When you pass by him or her... try to look in his/her eyes.. notice how amazing they are... :D but then quickly look away!    2. Call his/her name!    Everyone reacts when someone calls his or her name... but one thing that will make him/her notice you without intentionally calling him/her is that... when you see a person you know (with the same name as your crush) and your crush at the same place.. you shout his/her name! Then both your friend and your crush will look but then your crush notice that you approach your friend who has the same name.. (believe me! this works every time!) :D    3. Smile at him... *smiles*    This is the simplest and most effective of all! Just simply smile at him/her and you'll never know your crush will smile back!    *smiles*    *smiles back*    *faints*    NOTE: but make sure you smile at him at the right time so that he/she won't think that you've gone mad by looking at him in a long period of time....    4. Know his or her great buds!    Just be friendly with them... You'll have lots of friend to be with in time of need... Just talk about everything naturally... Except the part of your crush! And you get to talk to him/her too!! and the bonus is that.. you get to see your crush in their environment when they are all oh-so-comfortable!    5. Dress nicely... :D    Choose clothes that fits your personality so that he will be able to know what kind of person you are... You gotta stand out in the crowd! And the hair.. you can experiment what style you would like! Be creative!    I don't know if you feel this way too but does your crush stands out in the crowd? Like, you really know if he's there or something? Oh well! it does to us! :D haha!    6. Join contests at your school where you can display your talent!    Join some contests that you will be able to win! Like declamation, Art contests, dance contests or even quiz bees! And your crush will be like "Woah! She/he is good at this! Cool!" Show them what you're good at!    7. Talk a lot!    It really pays off being a talkative person! Talkative = lots of people will listen! And you gotta be funny too! And the best thing that can happen is seeing your crush listening and laughing! And that makes your heart jumps, ain't that right?    8. Earn a nickname that everyone knows!    Earn a nickname.. a positive nickname! Like "Miss/Mister Linguistic" and it does pay off knowing different language! :D or even "Einstein"... or simply just your nickname.... you never know he might start calling you with that nickname!    9. Know what your crush likes!    Know what his/her hobbies... whatever he/she likes to do.. you gotta show interest! I guess we all know that if you have a crush, you look for something you have in common! Even though its senseless! Like, you have the same favorite color..stuffs like that.... But things begins with these stuffs! :D Kinda true ya' know!    10. And last! Just be yourself when you are around him/her!    Don't try be someone you're not.. 'cause that's just like living a lie! And believe me..that's horrible at the end! Just act natural! Try not to blush! And forget that you will just blabber in front of him! He might even think it's funny! :D                So what's you waiting for? Go and let your crush notice you!|`|wFWytGlxaa	Talk to him.    Ask him to hang out.    Guys will only take notice of girls who try to initiate situations.    Also: make sure you look nothing but your best 100% of the time.    Good Luck|`|9eMYzY0Paa	do something he likes. If he likes sports talk about them in front of him|`|7mrtqwJwaa	Start talking to him and flirt a little.|`|Ut750mzQaa	be bubbly and out there|`|wjD7vLrVaa	I always get that situation,i get a lot of girls having crush on me,  tell him you want to be his girl friend.  "hey, i think you are cute, can i be your girlfriend?'   That simple. i don't know why girls shouldn't ask a boy out.  Forget the gender card here.  life is short to be worrying about every little thing in our life.  have fun.    Edit: don't listen to girl above me. "be bubbly" wtf? be yourself!
vpvITq2Daa	u sound like me im in 9th grade and have hade this problum many time. what u need to do is get him to notes u. try talking to him see if u can get to gether and do something.|`|6J8sHGRIaa	Hmmm... There are plenty of ways to make you not think of him.    1. Accept it. Whether your window of opportunity came and went, or they're just not into you, acknowledge the reality of the situation. Tell yourself the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.    2. Move on. Make a promise to yourself to get over it. If you're reading this article, you're ready to take this step, so just do it.    3. Reassure yourself. Look in the mirror every morning, smile, and tell yourself, "You're worth it." Really mean it. You didn't do anything wrong, and right now there's someone else out there for you. And it always helps to remind yourself that they are the ones that are going to be missing out on you.    4. Maintain your decision. If you find yourself slipping, remember the promise you made to yourself.    5. Associate. If and when you catch yourself thinking about your crush, pick out something about them that you dislike, and focus on it. Be honest. You may have built a fantasy of them in your head, but in reality they're not as great.    6. Distract yourself. Go out with your friends and have fun. Meet new people. Find a show or a game to immerse yourself in. Keep yourself busy and happy.    7. Take care of yourself. Keep well-groomed and put on your best clothes. It will do wonders for yourself esteem. Remember step three.    8. Find someone else. It can be difficult to get over someone if you're sitting there alone on Friday nights. Instead, call up that girl/guy you see who always smiles at you.    9. Live life. You're a great person and he/she was a fool not to see that. Before you know it you'll be back on track.    10. Get it out. A good cry always helps. just let your feelings pour out and before you know it. He will be just a thing of the past.    Tips:    * Keep smiling. Think positive thoughts and it will show on your visage.  * Remember that there are many other people simply begging for it from you.  * When you see them, smile and greet them like usual, and walk away confidently.      Oh, yeah...    * Do not become rude or disrespectful around them. Treat them like a normal human being.  * If the two of you are friends on MySpace or a similar site, consider taking them off your buddy list or at least removing your subscription to them. When you see a bulletin they've posted or a blog they wrote, just skip past it.  * Don't talk to them when you're under the influence of alcohol. You will say something you regret.  * Remember not to gossip or talk bad about them behind their back, because it WILL come back to haunt you.    Good luck! :]|`|61Wrl89Maa	Well to answer your question, yea, i got over my crush. What should you do? Make a move or move on.
0FXVTZf7aa	If you are seriously trying to be abstinent, those are the wrong things to be thinking about.  You'll get the job done a lot easier than you'll find a virgin to marry.  I used to go to conservative churches that teach that abstinence crap, and I learned that the leaders of these churches actually crack jokes about 30 and 40 year-old virgins behind their backs. Now I just send my Christian friends to the site below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. I hope it helps you.|`|AA10684513	Just take your time and be gentle.  Her cherry will break and it will be wonderful for you both.  Good Luck|`|dVlLahozaa	its the same question as before
dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Its possible for her to of broken it already with any number of physical activities.  Motorcycle riding, horse back, gymnastics ..etc<br>  <br>  You also do realize that if you don't have sex before marriage she could just lie and say she is a virgin.  She could of been riden by an entire football team the night before and you would not know the difference.<br>  <br>  BTW, 30% of men are raising another man's child without knowing it.<br>  If only half of the women get pregnant that means 60% of women cheat.  It really doesn't matter if you both are virgins or not.  The odds are still high that one of you will be unfaithful.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|kbz5S3waaa	even if she's virgin her hymen may already be torn from sports or tampons or anything really. It's not 'popping the cherry' that actually hurts, it's the unfamiliarity and stretching caused by your penis. Lots of lube and foreplay will help, but regardless it's going to hurt her for a few times, then after that she's not going to like sex for a while, and then suddenly one day.. Voila - sex is great.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It's called her hymen.  <br>  <br>  If you want advice, I advise you to use the proper terminology.<br>  <br>  You cannot prevent it from hurting her.  It's a membrane that has to rip open to allow your penis through.  It's going to hurt.  Ramming into her will make it hurt more, obviously, but there is no way to guage how much pressure is too much or not enough.<br>  <br>  How long does it take?  Once you puncture the membrane once, it's done.  It could break on the first stroke, it could take hundreds.  <br>  <br>  The reason people call you idiot and troll is because this section is for marriage and divorce questions.  You are looking for sex education, not marriage and divorce advice.  Perhaps try in the health section?  Or at least Singles and Dating...|`|qpAYU8Knaa	It is called 'popping' the cherry not breaking it. If you are patient and she is well lubricated then it would not hurt more than a few ants biting her. Chances are good that her hymen is already broken due to physical activities like bicycling, riding, etc. Some girls don't bleed or don't feel any pain when it happens. You need to focus on keeping it hard and popping it and let she will let you know if it hurts.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Chances are that her hymen (aka cherry in this case) is already ripped from the use of tampons or playing sports. Still, make sure you ease in gently and use lots of lube. It isn't as painful as some people make it out to be.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Are you like 12 or something?|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You don't seem to know what a "cherry" (disgusting reference btw) is.  It doesn't even exist on some women, and the wind blowing the wrong way breaks it, so I don't know how you assume it's going to be there except maybe a lack of education... I mean, you ARE a virgin.<br>  <br>  IF you don't want it to be so painful, you should try stimulating her first.  If you don't, it'll be terrible for her.<br>  <br>  Please at least try watching some pornographic movies before you jump in and leave her unsatisfied.  THIS is why I don't believe in waiting until your married.  Much lame sex is ahead.|`|AA11071040	Are you planning on getting married soon, or is this information for the distant future?  If you use a lot of lubricant and be gentle, it shouldn't hurt too much.  Breaking of the cherry is a figure of speech, there is no cherry.  It is the hymen that breaks and it could have been broken years ago, not just by having sex.  It is nice that you are so concerned, but let nature take it's course.  If it hurts the first time, it won't the second time.  Relax.|`|57IDs4byaa	First of all as a christian, I commend you for your decision. Now I know it means a lot to a man to be gentle for her first time because he cares about her and doesn't want her to experience pain in such an Intimate situation. Use a lubricant and go very slow. If things don't last for very long, don't sweat it. The second time will be better. Just let her know how much you care about her while in the act. <br>  once again congrats on the decision.|`|JppKTOPnaa	Well, as long as your dick is bigger than her middle finger, lets hope thats the case, than  you can break her cherry with a full stroke. Just try to stay slow and say comforting things.|`|Gv71dW0oaa	the key is to take it slow and let her go on top so she can control it.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	you asked this question already....it is gonna hurt her no matter what!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	First, it's a 'hymen', not a 'cherry'. For most women, it gets broken in adolescence by horseback riding, gymnastics, etc. etc. It stays intact for relatively few women, but the absence of an intact hymen does not mean the woman is not a virgin. Romance novels/erotica over -emphasize the whole 'hymen-breaking' part of losing your virginity.<br>  <br>  Some women bleed the first time they have sex, some women don't. Sex can be uncomfortable more than painful, so don't worry about how much 'pressure' you need to 'apply'. Use plenty of lubrication, go slow and talk to her during.|`|dVlLahozaa	well she will be nervous and so will you the first time but just try to be relaxed and make her feel relaxed.|`|PR1JaFWfaa	I understand your concern.  Improperly done it could cause severe physological trauma, and make her hesitant to have sex, particularly with you, for the rest of your relationship.  <br>  <br>  Best to Email me with her phone number and I'll take care of it.|`|ulxe0jPZaa	Your thinking too much on this one.  Do what you would normally do, be gentle and understanding and remember that it is new for her too.
NOYOgHIEaa	hes just a little nervous and shy... dont worry about it :) maybe hes not ready to get that tied down and maybe dissapoint the girl cause he doesnt know if u two will work out u know?
1fB2UdRHaa	Just two hours ago I was with my best friend.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	I haven't seen mine in months... It really does hurt me mentally, because I miss her so very much...|`|ZaPj1OIbaa	i saw her a couple of minutes ago, she just left|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	My best friends are my sisters (3), and try to see them every day, they`ve been there for more than 40 years and I know I can trust them without question.The ones out of the family who played "friends" I haven`t see them for like 6 months and they don`t bother to see me and I don`t miss them..  Good for you if you found your real close friend, don`t lose her/him- and take care of your friendship!..
PLEIYAnAaa	maybe he's just polite and nice and does it for every girl.  you won't really know until he says it himself.|`|8m0OWTO8aa	well.... hes not moody. hes just shy.       you could always ask him out.... that'll be your best bet at finding out if he likes you or not. =)|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If you are female then yes, he likes you.|`|xttzCf90aa	why dont you just ask him

She might be interested.|`|a8a9triNaa	ONG THAT MEANS.....she smiled at you....HOW UN EPIC!|`|tzzYdnZKaa	honestly a smile is a smile.

p9DW7iRfaa	Confront Ryan. Yes, it's possible he won't tell you the truth. If he tells you that he didn't, but you don't believe him, then you should break off the relationship. If he's lying to you two days into the relationship, something's wrong.    PS: Just out of curiosity, if Ryan's exgirlfriend is still interested in Ryan, why is she dating Jack?
0aH1KvbEaa	I like shy girls sometimes they are more fun once you get them to open up. Being funny is def a nice trait it beats the girl with no sense of humor for sure. Sensitive is good as long as you can take a joke or unless you mean sensitive to your partners feelings which is of course a good thing.    If your pretty and not super thin def my type.. don't like girls that try to look like a celebrity (the skinny ones I mean..) I like having sometime to hug. As long as your not taller than me.. 6"2. And quiet kind of goes with the shy thing in my opinion. And it probably just means I gotta get you talking and we'll have a good conversation.|`|UWNgB9gAaa	Definitely yes although I don't like tall girls that much..|`|MzSFaebraa	Totally|`|tHHHN9RFaa	i would
YzJP6uyeaa	Tell her it's making you uncomfortable and it's unfair because she knew you liked him, still she flirts with him etc. If she doesn't listen, stop being her friend. Friends shouldn't do that|`|h6NqNzHAaa	She can't steal what you don't have in your possession.
stv1JMXNaa	Well, she doesn't sound like much of a friend. I would talk to her about it. Tell her it bothers you that she does that and that you don't think she's being a good friend by doing that. If she doesn't seem to care, then move on from her and find other friends. And the guy you like is just one guy. If he liked you first and now is all about her, then he's probably just a jerk. I'm sure that if he can do that, he isn't worth your time. There is 8 billion people in this world, chances are, if you're still young, and he does that, he isn't the one for you. If he was, he wouldn't care that she likes him and he would still like you. I hope everything works out for you,|`|xgJbxZgfaa	she's not your friend, and move on from that jerk, u deserve better!!|`|aC9dBaNqaa	apparently she is not your friend and she didn't steal him you can't take someone from somebody either he was yours or not but either way now you know what they both are about|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	She  may  have  told  him  "things"  about  you  but  I  don't  think  she  stole  him  from  you  exactly.  He  was  the  one  to make  a  choice  between  you  and  her,  and  she  won  out.  If  she  actually  did  win  him  away  from  you,  then,  good  riddance.  You  wouldn't  want  a  guy  who  wanted  someone  else  would  you?  I  sure  wouldn't.  There  is  a  guy  out  there  somewhere  who  wants  you  and  not  her.  He'll  find  you  eventually.  In  the  meantime,  get  on  with  your life.  Get  busy  with  new  friends,  new  things  to  do,  and  new  places  to  go.  Get  involved,  get  busy  in  your  life.  Church  youth  activities  always  has  something  going  on.  If  you  don't  have  a  church,  find  someway  to  make  yourself  useful  at  school,  or  in  neighborhood/community  projects.  Just  get  your  mind  off  of  the  situation.  Helping  others  and  not  focusing  on  your  own  troubles,  always  makes  you  see  what  really  is  important  in  life.
WB8uBODtaa	A fit athletic body, a nice face and a cute butt :).|`|sYxtPBziaa	If she takes care of herself, eats healthy, exercises, doesn't try to be what everyone wants her to be. Hey, I'm a teenie too so don't go assuming weird stuff...stupid negative votes... who thought of that anyways?

WFRooU7Maa	Just chill out and keep doing what your doing.    Maybe make it less stressful or personal and ask her if she wants to join you and your friends with something you are doing on the weekend.  As her to something other will be doing to, it makes it easier on people    Hopefuly this works, and then after a while of this you could see if she want to go on a date, but her her time|`|hEcKmleVaa	Maybe she's just not ready to date.  I am sure she likes you but she needs more time to mature.  Don't pressure her, but continue to be nice to her and smile and speak to her when you can.|`|XzkvqTyxaa	tell her she can tell you anything with no judgment. that might calm her stress level down a little.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Why don't you leave it open ended for her? Do you perform some activity weekly that she could attend? Let her know that you do this and it would be great if she could stop by and hang out with you after. This way you are not changing your plans and she has a weekly opportunity to see you if she is interested.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	Try one more time to go on a date.

Don't just ignore her or anything though, just be her friend for now. Maybe she's just not ready for a relationship, or maybe she's scared that if you two date it could mess up your friendship. Give her a little time. :)     Next time you ask her out, ask her what days she's not busy.. ask her when she'd like to go out with you. :) good luck, hun.

AA11607270	First of all there is nothing wrong with being Asian. Fat well that's another story...The way you talk sounds like there maybe some narcissism going on in with his girlfriend. Some people are just not built to be faithful and your brother should run away from her fast.
AA11674544	You already know the answer to this. Your brother is trying to protect you from what you already know. Your boyfriend is bad news! You will probably continue dating him and looking for the good in him. Well, what a waste of time that will be. Your family loves you and they are trying to protect you from a guy who is obviously not worthy of you. Your brother is so sweet! I am sure it is annoying to you, but really, he loves you and wants to protect you from yourself and your bad judgment. Well, you probably won't listen, and you will learn the hard way like most people. Good luck and remember that your family loves you!|`|bZTJYsoLaa	If you want to get drunk or get screw that's your right. Don't drag in your family. They just love you. If you careless then don't even bother to ask this stupid question.Leave your home and move in with your so call good boyfriend. And see how good he will treat or feed you.|`|SvtJdn1Vaa	Your brother is looking out for you. He probably does not want you to get mixed up in your bfs antics.     My advise to you is your young, and you have plenty of time to find a "good guy" You shouldn't let your family pick for you, but if they have that strong of feelings, then it's probably for the best.|`|6KVGwdBQaa	You need to listen and obey your parents and be thankful that you have a caring brother.  God gave us parents for a reason, they love you and have your best intrest at heart.  You're only 14, you don't have the right to make your own dating decisions yet.  Stop being rebelious and do what you're told.|`|feedTbEvaa	If I was your brother, I'd kick his a** too.You need to grow up and quit trying to "rebel".You know who is right in this situation, and you should be grateful you have a family that actually cares and is concerned for your well-being.I seriously hope you realize this sooner than later.
wzqahEqiaa	I feel sorry for your children.  You are basing life altering decisions entirely on emotions.  Emotions and feelings can change but marriage vows never change.  Marriage is about commitment.    Genuine love is wanting what is best for another person before thinking about yourself. He is cheating on his wife and doesn't care about his marriage. Is your goal to marry this man? If you do marry him he will likely have an affair again.  Don't be surprised when you feel hurt and rejected.    You have already had an affair with a married man.  Why would you be concerned about cheating on a man that isn't married to you?  You aren't his wife and there is no commitment.  Feelings don't equal a commitment.|`|AA10025824	You have issues that are too deep to solve here.  Good Luck.|`|pnxzK1nhaa	Hmm you sound like the fool in all of this.He is lying to you, you were fun when he was married and he couldn't have a commitment with you but now that he can have one with you he is bailing.He was waiting for something like this to happen so he could tell you that he couldn't be with you because he couldn't trust you.Isn't it funny that he is magically gettting divorced when he tells you that he can't be with you?.....I mean think about it, he would have to be the biggest hypocrite in the world to say he can't trust you because of your cheating ways.Move on, he doesn't want you for more than piece.|`|t9c4vOZmaa	Sounds like you two deserve one another god get some class!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	your going to heaven....hell doesnt want you|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	aww you two are so perfect.   cheaters + cheaters = super awesome relationship.     get the sarcasm? how can you even trust him after he has cheated on his wife the whole time you have been together? I am assuming that his wife didn't because you said "living in secrecy"...    and honestly!!! ended up kissing other guys? what does that mean? they were in the way of you and your lipstick? They forced to kiss you?   NO! it was your decision to kiss and sleep with other guy(s) and now live with it.     TIP: try to control your overactive vagina.     Guilt doesn't buy love.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Congrats...you have written the absolute dumbest thing I've ever read!

I'm not reading all that, but you sound like one dumb whor3!|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	The only "wrong" thing here is that you did it behind his back. Lying is never good.   Hello, you can love him till you're purple, but he is married. That means you will always be his  2. What's with all this guilt? He's sleeping with his  1 on a regular basis, and you're somehow OK with it.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	people who date the married suck.|`|YDXBmfVLaa	Be glad he still is remaining friends with you its better then losing him out of your life altogether.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	what the name of the book your reading?   you sound like a real h;;;;;;;;;r|`|vSJIorF7aa	You should become a nun.|`|91sBjTtAaa	you deserve what you get|`|KnMdFqq0aa	Ok, don't listen to those other people....hello people try to give some constructive advice...    Lady, this guy was/is playing you...if he hasn't left the wife by now, he won't and if he does, it won't be for you. He has an issue with you sleeping with another man yet I bet you anything he is still sleeping with his wife. That should tell you something.  If he really wanted you, he would have left the wife when you left your husband.     The guilty feelings are not with just the man you slept with I am sure they are way deeper than what you are letting yourself believe.     You can be redeemed in your own eyes, the eyes of your family and God...but it is going to take some willpower on your part.     One, leave the married man alone...he is not yours and would you really trust him if he were? Your whole relationship is based on deceit and mistrust, sneaking around and sordid stuff...not a good way to start a life with someone.     Leave him. Take some time for you...get YOU figured out and then you can go out and find someone worthy of you...you are too good to be someone's "side dish" You need to find out why you are settling for this turd.     Check out Joyce Meyer ministry...she has a lot of good info and you need to get your head on and move forward.|`|roGfyzcHaa	You are both stupid!!!|`|W1mPMQmOaa	How pathetic. Your life is screwed.|`|BqrQFLH5aa	WOW    are you like a pathological liar/cheater?    i cant even express how completely disgusted i am right now|`|IbSy8thKaa	First of all you should have never slept with a married man that is completely devoted to his wife and I do not know who turned who on but sounds to me you did. He also probably read your texts because he probably was suspicious. I think what you did is completely and honestly stupid because you left a marriage of 6 years and 2 children for a married man and on top of that you slept with someone else that is so absurd of you.You ruined your marriage and his marriage and you have a lot of guilt to be ashamed of. My best friend Nikki of of almost nine years now has two wonderful little boys got married in December of 2006 or 2007 and she started seeing this other guy phil on the side he didn't know about and he found out later on and he was so shocked that she would do that. her marriage was still fresh and she cheated and still is and has been talking about a divorce with him but the divorce has not even begun.I hate what she did but in the end shes going to get screwed over badly. I would say the best advice i would give you is to try to not talk to him because if hes ignoring you just leave it go. Also if your divorce is not final yet i suggest you try to work it out with him and get him back. well this is all i have for you i fear for the childrens  safety.bye|`|yLQ2rUHnaa	!!!!i hope i get kicked off of yahoo for even reading this stupid ******* question!!!|`|AA10442322	I think you are really loss in the relationship. You want his love, yet you are not completely getting it. Therefore, you have another guy as a companion.     Lady, you should move on. Put your mind in a single guy that truly loves you and stay with him.    Stay true!
FZKFLTyLaa	Make eye contact a lot and touch his arm gently with your hand while you are talking to him.<br>  He'll get the message.
tBdceRrPaa	Be friends with the guy.....just make your intentions clear.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	dont apologize. let it go|`|tNdYtp2daa	Tell him you should not have been a rude little b****.|`|AA12261667	of course you HAVE to talk to him.  but dont text him   talk to him in person even though it may be a little nerve racking  Hope it works out =]|`|8E59Idahaa	I think you definitely should.  Even if he doesn't reply back or anything at least then your mind will be at rest.  You should explain to him that you weren't trying to be horrible, and you never meant to hurt his feelings. But the feelings you had for him before aren't there anymore and that you still really want to be friends.   I hope that helps.    xx|`|KGZlxhAVaa	Thanx for answering my question!    um.. i think you should just apligize and invite him to the movies with you and a bunch of friends so he doesn't feel like you loath him but like him, AS A FRIEND.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	tell him to get over you!|`|qzgBqluRaa	i have done this b4 and just let him be. if he does not want to talk to you then dont. and u r not a bad person|`|120be10147b8401ffd627f585bdc804daa	well.....  if you want to be his friend, say so  but only if you actually really do mean it|`|sxKjYyXsaa	Texting isn't always the best because it doesn't clearly depict the emotions you have.    Be honest with him, and make sure you talk to him in person with no one else around. Tell him that you just aren't into him, and that you apologize for the misconception.    Also, don't let him make you feel horrible. That's his goal. "Oh maybe if she feels bad for me, she will date me."    Say your honest opinion, but don't include the, "We can still be friends," part because it is too typical and predictable. Closing your conversation, let him know that you would love to hang out with him, but suggest that some of his friends and your friends come too. More people leads to less pressure.    And remember: don't make him the enemy, and don't let him make you the enemy. Keep the peace.|`|k1z84KG7aa	u know wut u should say? wut u just said in ur question: u feel horrible and weren't trying to be mean, just honest. if he had a heart or any feelings, he would understand. but don't waste ur time moping over him...guys aren't worth that...hope this helped!(:

If you are serious about changing then try Nutri-systems...for the cost it's less than what you pay for meals during your day! What have yo to lose but wright? Think about it!|`|eF2OkxMqaa	Try an internet dating website, like okcupid.com<br>  -which is free.|`|mg0u1w9Jaa	If you're nice and have a good personality it shouldn't matter at all! It seems that the only roadblock you have is yourself! You blame it all on your weight which probably isn't true and base all your problems on your weight. If you're so bugged about it just make an effort to loose weight :) Good luck!
0ClA7HlEaa	you have to trust your bf and dont overreact whatever he does.|`|UjTX851faa	Ri  You have to stop this worrying so much. If I could see anything ruining this relationship this would be it. Sense the first time I answered your question your bf has come a long way and still you have to. But you are still badgering him with the same questions. He is getting tired of it. Not good...   If he had been  telling you the truth lately then give him credit okay. You are just worrying yourself by continually thinking about oh what if he smokes weed today or tomorrow. Let that go... The only way you are ever going to trust him is if you give him the chance.   No more random texts dont even bring it up to him. Then his true actions will come through and you may be surprised to find that he doesnt. Let it go. Really you should just enjoy your time with him... This is only making the relationship unenjoyable for you and him.   Just give him the chance...  Hope that helps.
3MFzTysmaa	oh my gosh...<br>  <br>  well you answered your question, right there...

SwFaa4Zzaa	you can't really give anyone directions on how to kiss.  try putting your head on his shoulder.  if he's smart, he'll lift up your chin and kiss you.    you just kind of have to go with the flow, and try to enjoy it, although first kisses aren't always all that great.    trust me, i was nervous before my first kiss.  and the guy told me after that i was amazing haha. so no need to be nervous, my dear.    good luck, and happy kissing(:

I dated him, who was 16, and he done ALL kinds of drugs. plus other crap thats just not normal. Do yourself a favor, and move on! You have to save yourself. If you date him, you may even develop his bad habits.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	I agree with ALiSA.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	well if you like the guy ask him out usually ppl that do those things want to stop and they cant do it alone you would be a great help to him
	I'm sorry to say this to you, but it seems that he merely thinks of you as a friend. Instead of pursuing him, if he has feelings for you, let him pursue you instead. Don't put your whole heart into him, but enough to keep hope of him feeling the same way for you that you feel for him. Good luck. :)|`|	i think he likes ur friend. these things happen, its just too bad.

Answer mine please?:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Z3a1cRL7aa	long distance relationships are hard, especially when you have NEVER actually met the person.  It is very difficult to really know someone that you have only met on the internet, people can talk themselves up as much as they want, and you have no way to decide what is fact and what is crap.  It sounds as though he does like you, but I would not go for it.  If anything I would attempt to make a friendship with this man.  If you can go a considerable time being friends (6-12 months) then you might possibly decide to try dating.  If he is not willing to be your long distance friend, a long distance relationship probably wouldn't work for very long either.|`|QFrSxzQJaa	I like the first answer, do that|`|O1BJ7XUwaa	I remember you young girl saying you were only 13? Go ahead this is the period of crushes for teens like you. Enjoy. But then again, Know the guy how serious he is or  he might be saying THE SAME things whenever she talks with a young girl as lovable as you. If he decides to see you out just make sure it's a safe place baby. KNOW the guy by asking him questions about himself, his family, his hobbies and friends. You can assess his attitude the way he answers your questions. Nothing is best than knowing the guy IN PERSON. You forgot to mention how old he is, I know boys very well they do get involved with a lot of crushes at this stage. =) Ask me more if something progresses or any development. Take care.
2oXy22pvaa	Why be average/normal? Live life the way you feel like it. Just cause other girls may have a boyfriend, doesn't mean it's necessarily right for them/anyone of that age.     There's no real average age. Girls these days are getting into guys at a younger age. I think you shouldn't really have a boyfriend till your at least 15. That's just a personal opinion, yet I'm still a teen myself. Just I think it's silly for a 13 year old to have a boyfriend.     Don't feel bad about being different, just make sure you're ready and keep your parents in your life. Make sure they know what's going on and approve of it. Because though most teens don't believe it, but your parents probably actually aren't completely stupid.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	There is no average, date when you find someone you like and care about, not because it gives you the right to say "I am dating someone".|`|WB8uBODtaa	5 or 6.|`|nHi1mioBaa	15|`|GlP7KECoaa	it really doesn't matter|`|1BGwGFQZaa	My suggestion is 16 the age of a little more responsibility.

jv8Qyi2Laa	I have to agree...it must be hard for you guys...I guess were just afraid...for instance...most guys tried to pick up on me so that they can get to my better looking friend...after so many nights like that you start to wonder why a guy is REALLY talking to you.  So, when you say something to a girl or something funny try not to address the group or make eye contact with the girl you are talking to ...compliments go a real long way.  Especially sexy comments like....I really like the way you fit into those pants or that dress!!  OOOweee!

I give guys leeway, as long as he's not being a lech or rude, I overlook a lot of "cheesy come-ons."  I think a lot of high-maintenance women are still riding on the feminist movement that men are cavemen and are scum and are OBLIGATED to do this or that.<br>  <br>  I think we're all equal, there's no one better than the other.  Women want equality?  We got it.  We get paid less?  Sucks, but we adapt.  Men should be expected to clean house and take care of children just like women are expected to work.  <br>  <br>  This uneven playing field needs to stop.|`|TIZc5nrSaa	We feel that we deserve the best! We actually want a relationship, where 9/10 times you guys don't. We really just don't want to get hurt, or waste time. We have to give you that stamp of approval and make sure your prince charming. It gives us the security we need, also we know your not perfect! Sometimes its just nice to think that we've finally met that person!|`|0FcCadYJaa	well im a girl and im not like that ONE BIT! but i guess because they just are tired of fake guys.trust me i would no.<br>  but its just because they are probly tired of guys that like them JUST for there looks instead of who they really are and they are just trying to see how you are and if you are nice and stuff <br>  this is my opinion|`|LbQJVQFLaa	well honestly, us ladies cn be pretty uptight nd hav way too high of standards.we jus want everythin to be picture perfect, but to be truthfully honest, if we notice yur flaws, we rly dnt lik you . cuz its lik pretty ric sed, we live on earth, we all hav flaws but when you rly lik a guy or at least yur first impression maks you strongly infatuated w.them it dsnt matter if they say "I'm sorry I was so rude before... but... it's difficult for me... to... express myself... when I am on the verge of... exploding in my pants." soo ya<br>  answer is: [most] woman hav high standards.|`|xtpDZ7Thaa	because we want you to be creative we want some one diffrent not ordinary, sort of like in the movies but we don't expect you to do anything crazy just put a little more effort into things.|`|d1ef96d1ed947a87362ec02fa3112539aa	idk why we want soo much<br>  but most of the time, the female is just trippin anyway,<br>  try to find a girl that still lets you be a guy but knows wat she wants.<br>  its all in the standards|`|XdwJdwNEaa	some guys expect a lot to.. so stop,its both guys and girls who expect a lot its just different things we want.|`|G4JHpKogaa	Do not try to figure out people. They do not know what they want. One step at a time.|`|FoEWvYEsaa	because girls are absolutely nuts....  completely insane...|`|tJGbfxdgaa	because we actually want love.. not just settling for anything that breathes.|`|hXFndli2aa	ugh!!! don't understand your question please ask again!|`|uLHtXibRaa	I dont agree...i think men often interpret it this way and do not want to accept the fact..women have emotions that are more sensitive than their own.. ..most men do not want to have to deal with a womans need to be held,talked too and appreciated..All we ask for is love and that seems to be to much for any man to do..no one is perfect..i certainly do not expect perfection as i cannot give it in return but i do expect, truth,loyalty..and and maturity..so maybe there are women who expect more than a man can ask but thats time for that man to decide if that woman is suitable for him..there are women who do not expect a man to be other than what he is..human..in all honesty..men do not understand women nor do women understand men..but we need each other..thats what keeps us together..a mutual longing for companionship..and love...altho the ideas about both is totally different in each sex..|`|cdUCCHgaaa	i think its like history. men used expect a **** ton from women and now we expect too much from men. wayyyyyyy tooo much. i dont think most us girls understand it takes two. not just the guy.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	I don't understand your details.  They seem garbled.<br>  <br>  As for your main question, I'll answer it WITH a question:  Why do men expect so much from women?<br>  <br>  It works both ways, dude....|`|N361k5Hsaa	bc men r the ones that r expected to be tough and defend the girls and stuff|`|sc4jNqjTaa	because unlike guys we actually acpect someone to care about us. plus we have to go through so much and we want a little sympathy|`|8a65VDAKaa	because of movies and the idea of what a guy can be. most women need a reality check when it comes to their men because they dont realize that we need to do stuff for ourselves too. it might sound selfish, but not everything that we do has to be with our girl, or for our girl. <br>  <br>  just like men expect women to look like celebrities or porn stars, because of TV...   <br>  <br>  some lucky people find a person that complements them (i.e. a guy does everything for a woman that is really hot. he doesnt mind doing all those things women want because he's gonna get to have sex with a "goddess", if you will..) make sense?|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Wow, so bitter... It has NOT been my experience that women in my life expected any more of ME than I of THEM. Sure, some more than others wanted to change me and sometimes I accommodated them and sometimes I didn't, but I do not see that as a greater expectation or that they expected "so much" from me. If you make a poor first impression, then it only yourself you have to BLAME, if there is any blame to place that is... I feel sorrow for you, that you are so jaded against women... But on the other hand, that means less competition for ME since you are giving up...|`|KUZY05Lnaa	because we're only human. :) lol. well, i can honestly say i think its because we always picture somebody who doesnt have any  imperfections. but with experience i think we all come to learn that in order for a relationship to work, you have to be able to look over the imperfections and look at whats good about them.   if you dont want a women who expects a lot from a man, my only advice to you is to go gay.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	girls don't like cheese lines the best thing is to be yourself not try to be some rico suave that's fake and everyone can tell but the guy|`|uBW5xrK1aa	cause they want love...NOW!!! women think they each individually have what every man wants/needs and will always look for something better (shop around). so make yourself like the latest doo-dad and they'll pick you up.|`|oaVhxc8caa	Women just want to love and b loved!!!|`|goe3y4FPaa	CAUSE GIRLS..

dWHeWkb7aa	Well first of all.... coming from a guys perspective its not a huge deal, if you like him you need to let him know, no matter what! im not sure if the break up with you Ex was messy or not, if it wasnt a bad break up you should tell your ex first, and approach the situation very carefully because you dont want to break up his friendship wit hthe guy you like. But in my opinion if you like him then you need to tell him.|`|YWCBCWgDaa	I think you should ask him out, because he does like you.  And your ex should respect your opinions, and what choices you make...<br>  <br>  hope it helps a bit|`|KHVvDMLYaa	if you think it wont make your life horrible, why not? it wouldnt be weird. just dont think about the fact your ex if one of his friends.|`|QyBJsCy1aa	Jus ask him.<br>  <br>  It's better than wondering forever right?
x09r4OVdaa	Answer: Most Definitely. He likes you!    He obviously likes you. If he constantly says how hot girls are around you, it's an obvious sign he's trying to make you jealous. I mean, he asked you what sorority girl was the hottest? Puh-lease! He thinks that if you don't tell him, that you're trying to keep him away from them. He's trying to make you jealous. Period.    I mean, I would come right out and ask him. It sound like you guys are pretty good friends, and what if he says no? So what? At least you guys are still good friends. The point is is you'll never know how he feels unless you ask him.    Hope I helped! :)  ?Bri
AA11611389	Well then don't tell him.  You are in a good position because he knows what he can't do.  So you can just watch a movie with him, and start to cuddle.  If you want to kiss him, lean in and he'll know what to do.  But then just make sure he knows he can't take it further until you decide to.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	forget it he just wants to use you and move on his hormones are wild an he will do what he can get don't mean to be mean but its the only way to put it if its not you its someone else don't get mixed up in that nonsense you are too young and to top it off just think of the rep you ll pick up and believe me all of them say what you do and don't do. just find something else to do obviously your hormones are taking over your rational thinking|`|LS8LcuRaaa	What was he asking you to do? Sounds like he was asking you for sex. If that's the case you shouldn't just have sex with him, because that's all he wants if he's asking you just like that. You'll end up getting hurt. If you do just want to have sex just tell him you changed your mind, he obviously wants it, so he'll be happy if you say yes.|`|cDqz71QKaa	say"ive been thinkin and i really do like you and i just wanna know if your gonna be in this as a serious long term relationship even after you go to college"<br>  <br>  most likely he'll dump you for some high school chick he can do everynight|`|22NgAhCCaa	just tell him you change your mind and tell him you'll do the things you want to.... he'll be surprised and everthing will be ok|`|XiDzGfaXaa	just tell him straight up.(;<br>  most guys rather have it like that then it be all complecated!<br>  trust me! XD|`|H3h4j4aKaa	just put a move on him and go from there and stop him when you feel like it's gone far enough|`|d5QATr8Taa	i guess what you can do is to ask him if he is interested in doing any of those "things" and if he is that maybe it would be a good idea for you two to do them together since you guys seem to be good friends al least you can trust eachother. hope this helps|`|AA11052660	what sort of things did he ask you to do?|`|xggSASTwaa	just say this, "I was thinking, maybe you and me isn't a bad idea? I'm willing to give it a try" then also tell him about how he has to earn your trust and respect.
lmESBQb7aa	Just spend time with him. I think this will mean more than anything to him. Doesn't have to be anything expensive like you said. Go out to dinner and a movies maybe. I would also maybe writer him a poem/speech...that would be cute!|`|258mrT2Paa	buy 3 candles for cake and say ive saved us spending on next year,|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	couples' massages, rock climbing, go to a cheese or chocolate making place nearby, go to a winery or wine bar and bottle your own wine, take a cooking class together|`|7n2gIG0saa	do it for free, Check it out yourself.    http://www.goldenavenue.info/viewtopic.p...

0T6ympIvaa	Wow, talk about catch twenty-two just talk to him, let him know how you feel and actually let him know like really. write a note or something if you can't say it, but what i really don't understand if you guys are best friends why would this break you guys up like this just tell him you want to be that friend that did this or how much fun we had when we did this again and it hurt to see you not my friend and how much you mean to me and i want you as my friend to the end.  <br>  <br>   just give it all you've got he has to forgive and i (hope) he forgives you nobodies perfect we make mistakes everyday and that's what help us learn from them. every body needs an second chance believe me
Wi6tb3KDaa	well just make sure that you're ready for it...both physically and mentally.  be relaxed and have foreplay before hand.  it's going to hurt obviously but as long as you aren't dry down there, it will hurt less.  remember, the wetter the better.  also make sure that he is very gentle with you. he may get a little excited and try to go in deeper faster but don't be afraid to stop him and tell him to slow down.   take charge and be the boss   good luck!
hBGZYDKAaa	Guy 2! I mean guy  1 is cute but I think he would look better without facial hair. I'm not a big fan of facial hair. Anything more than a goatee grosses me out! He does have cute dimples though. Guy number 2 is perfect. I mean he has gorgeous eyes and big plump lips! They look totally kissable! Man number two is  gorgeous!

NWbAHAKvaa	By different I'm sure you dont want dinner/movies because those are very typical. It really depends on the girl and what she likes(as well as how much you're looking to spend.  For example I have a fascination with stars/ the sky so one of my favorite nights out was a planetarium and dinner.    Some other ideas: a walk or carriage ride through a park(later available only in select locations), pack a picnic for the park or beach if you're somewhere warm(candles can provide light and be romantic, but if you're at the park you may want to opt away from them or get fake), a play or concert or comedy club.  If she likes a certain sport maybe take her to a game...If theres a pet store where you can socialize with the animals before buying take her there to socialize with a dog or cat. Go out dancing.  Mix and match as necessary...    Hope this helps.    Answer mine :)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	After 14 years, love is a choise. You either chose to love, or you chose to not love. Falling in love, on the other hand, which is typical for the beginning of a relationship, feel like something that happens *to us*, it feels like it happens naturally by itself.     It is your choise and I respect it either way. If you want different and especially incompatible things in life then I don't see how you can make it work.   It will be not possible to not hurt him if you chose to end the relationship. It's just another choise that would be up in the air - do you chose to hurt him or do you chose to hurt yourself by staying and accumulating resentment.    I guess what I'm saying it all comes down to owning your actions. I know you don't want to feel guilty for "ruinging" your marriage or for hurting your spouse. But you can't have it both ways. What most people do though they start looking for a fault in their spouse. Which you don't, and I have a great respect for you for not doing that. There is no fault. There are adult and mature choises.|`|sR6vhbataa	Well, I just want to add a bit of counterbalance to a previous reply. It takes two to tango and we don't know what the husband might have done to create distance as well.     The last thing you want to do is live a lie by pretending there's intimacy by having sex but just putting up with it. Sorry--No. Sex is about intimacy and sharing, not about obligation or duty. What men need to understand is that there's a lot more to sex than just jumping in bed and if there has been no emotional intimacy, physical intimacy doesn't work for many women.|`|9KMPOJf3aa	It sounds like you know you want a separation. You should explain to him how you feel.|`|sDlWcikIaa	It sounds like you are focusing your thoughts and energy on pulling away from him.  This will only point you in 1 direction.    Try turning your focus on how happy you are... how wonderful your husband is... how you'd love to have a wonderful marriage again.    Your life will take a turn towards whatever direction you choose to focus on.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	???    You CHOOSE to not have sex with him for 4 months and you wonder what that tells YOU?    I think its a pretty clear signal that you have little regard for his feelings, his generosity, his tolerance, his patience, and his affection for you.    I think you don't know what you want...and are using him to further your own selfish interests.    I think this makes you feel guilty. But rather than admit your guilt and striving to be a good wife to your husband...you simply hate him even more for it.    Please omit your very first sentence "I care for my husband..."    You DON'T care for him. You don't care at all for him. A caring wife would make love to her man and use the experience to bond closer with him.    Did you think you would feel that same dizzy feeling forever? Did you not think that the infatuation of youth would not subside to the much stronger and enduring affection, the slowly and softly burning bedrock of admiration and consideration of middle age?    Do you think marriage is simply a bottle of campaign, to be tossed away when it no longer bubbles?    I wonder, if you've cut him off from physical affection, how much more you've hurt his emotional connection to you.    Did you not realize that your place...you duty...your obligation in the family was the emotional welfare of all its participants, first and foremost your husband?    You have no doubt he is still in love with you? I fear he greatly doubts if you're CAPABLE of love. I fear you've cruelly wronged your husband with your vindictive selfishness, your lack of understanding and sympathy.     Now you want to be rid of him? I wonder what you expected of him....that he would force your hand and make you have sex with him? Was he to bend you over a bedspread and force your body to please him?    Or did he trust that his commitment, his determination to guard and protect and provide for you would be returned with hugs and kisses and physical pleasure?    Is this not the trust EVERY man SHOULD afford his wife? Has he somehow failed in this?    Or have you decided that you are too high, too noble, or too valuable to be wasted on such a wretch of a man?     Not once did his requests, his pleading, his demands, and finally, turning away from you in bed to console his broken emotions ever once touch your heart in the last four months?    Are you not comparing him to some abstract ideal, fed by too many romantic comedies, thirty minute sitcoms, and Cosmo quizzes?    I assure you, he is human, and prone to error. He is not perfect. But on your wedding day, did you not swear before God that, whatever he might become, it would be enough?    Have you not crippled him, emasculated him, then complained that your husband is a broken eunuch?     What great strives have you made to build him up? To make him feel strong and protective? To help him understand by showing him generosity, compassion, tenderness, sympathy, and all the feminine wiles that were and are your birthright?     Have you made EVERY SINCERE EFFORT, to make him feel like your husband?    Or does he still love you despite your total surrender and betrayal of your wedding vows?    Is not "to forsake all others" a vow we make to forsake FIRST and FOREMOST ourselves? Is marriage not a daily exercise in compromise, compassion, sacrifice, and understanding?    Do you think him too dim, too brutish,or too stupid to understand how horribly you've treated him; what low regard you have for his efforts as a husband?    And are not your disputes, your discouragement, and your stubbornness to have your own way, merely illusions that you've built up, now shattered, not by your husband, but by life?    I think you're a very confused, spoiled, and cruel little girl. I think you're committing the adult equivalent of holding your breath and stomping until you turn blue to get your own way.    I think you've grown up being catered to. And I think that you have this one chance to love someone more dearly than you love yourself. I think you're chasing abstract shadows that promise you self fulfillment, when, in truth, you will simply be alone and filled with regret.    I think you had better apologize to your husband for your neglect (imagine if he said not a word to you for four months...you'd be accusing him of emotional abuse). Well, you're guilty of cheating. You have placed yourself as the most important thing in your life.    And such a life is doomed to bitter self examination, recrimination, and ridicule from every person who has knowledge of your marriage.    If I may offer one piece of constructive advice....go quickly to your man and make love to him. Feel his body under your finger tips. Smell his skin, touch his hair, look deeply into his eyes.    If you see a person whom you wish to cause unimaginable pain and loss, then leave without explanation (it would be a baseless self justification anyway). Otherwise, recommit yourself to serving and pleasing him first and foremost. Save your own self for last.|`|rx20pKgOaa	Wow - not much of a commitment on your part when you said your wedding vows?     All relationships change over time - we aren't always "in love" with our spouse.  Maturity is Choosing to Love when you don't feel "in love."     Why did you get married in the first place if you only planned to stay for as long and the infatuation lasted?      This is what gives women in general a bad name.|`|p6QizgmRaa	Think of your husband being fully involved with another woman. How would that make you feel? If you couldn't care less, time to get out of the marriage.  You tell him by saying, "Honey, I couldn't care less...".    It's never an easy thing to do. Just be honest with him.|`|3iNobwVraa	1. You.

I31CGu5Saa	From what I just read, it's not your fault for why she's mad. She's more or likely mad at her son for dating so young (even though I don't think it's young.)    My advice is talk to the mother as if she's your own mom. Stay calm, comfortable and be smooth. Don't talk about why she's mad, I mean like small talk. Mostly every ones parents that I meet think I have a great personality and very friendly because I talk to them as if they are my friends. This could work for you, let her know you can take care of her son. She's just worried that her son will do such things as sex, let her know it's all going to be fine.    I also buy the mothers a flower for a special occasion such as mothers day. =] Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|X88lyKHoaa	wow.  thats gottta be really hard.  get her flowers or something.  i have NO idea.  Thats a toughy  Good luck(:
GHZnLiYvaa	Well, if you have all the memories of the wonderful moments you shared with him, including pics and videos, how about putting them altogether in a CD.

You can have a look at the poems I've written for her on my blog.By the way it doesn't matter how good or how bad your voice is, all that matters if your honest about your feeling for him and the emotion you put in.    http://daymaker-urs.blogspot.com/|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Try to spend more time with him..

If you don't think you are a lesbian, then that means you're not a lesbian.  Your hearts not open to it because you're not ready for a b/f yet.  Don't allow yourself to crack under pressure to get a b/f just because your friends have one.  This just goes to show that you are not easily influenced by others.|`|yldz3WmCaa	No your not a lesbian at all, you just don't want a boyfriend, **** your friends and their pressure do what makes you happy.     good luck, i hope you find your happiness in whatever form.|`|4JGTC2MHaa	Not at all.Sixteen is not the be all and end all of relationships. Just because you won't open up it doesn't mean that you're sexually predetermined to be with a woman.|`|Rwg38ZxOaa	No you aren't just kinda date a guy for a while and just wait till your comfy to open don't force yourself|`|838TBllwaa	If you don't think you are a lesbian, then you are not. Plain and simple. Inside you know what you really want, and noone else can tell you this.    Just because you havn't found the right person yet, does not mean that you never will. It is common for girls to have several boyfriends throughout high school, but this does not mean that most girls do. In fact many of them do not, for a majority of reasons.    When you truely find someone you like, you will know it. Until then, don't give in to the pressures that just want you to conform like the rest. Wait and you will be truely happy.|`|X7OvS3mjaa	lol no you just havnt found the right guy deff dont rush into relationships tell ur friends at 16 they should be out partying getting hammered rather then stayin home with there boyfriends u girls have to remember these are the best days of ur life save the relationships for after college!|`|W7DhZSy3aa	if you find girls attractive then......mmmmm ask god to help you, maybe god just has someone special for you and he just hasnt come around yet and your spirit has a wall up waiting to be broken for the guy god intended you to be with..... just a thought|`|D1xkklSuaa	no it probably just means that you haven't found that certain someone yet. you have time, you're only in 11th grade and 16. people usually get married about 10 years after your age! but you're probably not a lesbian unless you love a girl romantically. if you really don't like anybody then don't go out with them cuz you're just wasting your time on somebody you don't really care about. you don't have to let them pressure you to get a boyfriend. you know what's best for you; they don't. i've been pressured too to get a boyfriend cuz i've never had a serious one except for when i was four.haha. not really.
3vnayfR7aa	Do something drastic, I felt the same way a few months ago, but I changed a few things around and now it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from me.    And I am so so so so much happier :)

52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Just the pot calling the kettle black.   I think that is all I would say and if she gave me anymore hassle (IE- can't take a hint)  I'd tell her to mind her own business and that I didn't want to hear from her if all she as going to do was b*tch and moan about my family.  Then I would hang up.  Time to set some (and keep some) boundaries as to what is appropriate behavior between sisters.<br>  <br>  Edit - It isn't special underwear...they call them "garments".   They look like a camisole w/ cap sleeves and a pair of  mid/knee length shorts.  Usually made out of cotton, silk, or rayon. They can wear their regular underwear w/ the garments.  Some do...some don't.  Its a matter of choice on that issue.  <br>  <br>  Also, like many other Christians faiths there are a lot of things your not suppose to do, but people do them anyway.|`|q2tT8ecraa	What does her being Mormon have to do with anything?  Are you judging her because of what her husband does?  Are you judging Mormons?  <br>  <br>  Mormons are people, not perfect.  You both sound kinds witchy.|`|dVlLahozaa	Don't listen to her or ignore her if this continues then tell her directly to stay out of your business|`|RyYV3aXlaa	Hang up the phone|`|YzlGwIO8aa	I am a mormon and know how many people both in and out of the church struggle with addictions, whether it be to porn or drinking.  She may not be able to distinguish between "social drinking" and alcoholic drinking because this is a religious taboo for us.  She may also be trying to control you since she can't control her husband.  She probably feels helpless.  It is good that you are continuing to have a relationship with her as she is probably kind of isolated.  I would just draw a line about what you are comfortable talking about.|`|776402222f313576ef25a004cfb3aed8aa	Tell her directly that you do not want to discuss your (or her) personal beliefs PERIOD. Leave it at that. If she can't respect that then let her be for a while and try it again...|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Aren't you being equally judgmental? Your question is phrased with such hostility.|`|mMfWgm38aa	I didn't know Mormon's were allowed to indulge in porn.....  I want to know, do Mormon's really wear special underware?|`|bO2rzfISaa	Mormons really do wear special underwear called garments.<br>  <br>  When people irritate me I always think I only have to put up with them for a while. They have to live with themselves all the time. That must suck.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	She is probably judging you because of her own insecurities, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable. Let her know that you're not going to tolerate it anymore. If she continues, hang up the phone and give her time to get over herself. I would never do that to my sister, especially if she really got her point across.
tL2U34kraa	well thats hard because he has a disability so probaly a lot of people are mean to him, and maybe he thoughtmore that you meant when you are nice,if he asks for your number but you don't feel comfortable then say sorry you can't have my number but we can still talk on facebook if you like.also make it clear that you both are just friends tell him that you like being his friend but thats all, butmake sure he likes you like that before u say that to avoid any other awkward moments.be a good friend but thats all treat him as you would a girl and  dont be overly nice or send him mixed messages be clear with him stand your ground.but not in a mean way, good luck|`|klcqgST9aa	Just keep being nice to him. When he calls, talk for a few minutes and then become "busy."    He'll just be excited that he called you. Try to talk to him less. Just cut off conversations by saying things that don't initiate more communication. For example, if he asked you if you had a nice day, say, yeah, rather than, yeah, it was a lot of fun, I did a lot of fun things.    Just get boring.  Since he has reduced social skills, he won't pick up on you trying to gget away from him, so this could go on for a while, but eventually, maybe during the summer, connection will just stop.|`|9HqgrhyUaa	run.
F5gtYbDVaa	dog.. its jsut myspace.. thats why i deleted myspace, it should burn! thats what myspace does to you..  but seriously.. you shouldnt itch out like that.. as long as hes not doing it just to find chicks or something.. if hes not doing that its not big deal.|`|KPR0tQtfaa	to be honest, i would. hopefully he is not hiding anything.
ZwDdYnM5aa	Just because you have most classes with Boyfriend  1 doesn't mean you're gonna be together. Get to know both of them first don't rush things otherwise you amy mess up both relationships.    Ask for their number hang out with them maybe even introduce them to eachother.|`|lXVwGgHmaa	i think go for guy 1. it seems like you just like looking at guy 2 and if you haven't talked to him you cant like him without knowing what hes really like.|`|wlvKveAXaa	1 same reson as Molly
GqhtePhgaa	Any time you have sexual activity, there's that possibility.  Though I'd think it's highly unlikely that it could happen if it's REALLY both your first time.  Maybe someone's not being truthful?  Anyway, if you're at all worried, a trip to the doctor would be in order...even if it's just to find out it's nothing.
TVvvEQXBaa	Aw, that is so darn cute! How corny can you get?

vW9qF5lSaa	I believe love is stronger than hate.  Hate is a byproduct of fear -- nothing more than a reaction to a fear stimulus, but love is a pure emotion that stands on its own.|`|8UgXZ6zuaa	I cant give you that detailed of an answer but it is for me.  I have been in love with the same man for two years now... and even though he's married, even though he has done awful things that I hate him for.... he's still my baby. He is stil the love of my life.|`|zmlIaSGiaa	Love is the only thing out there that has any chance of healing true emotional pain. Hate can destroy anything but I don't think it can ever break love. Love could also be more powerful in that it has the abilty to unite and destroy at the same time.|`|nPKobsseaa	Yes, since hate can easily come and go/start quickly and end quickly, but love sticks to you forever, and you never forget it. It's like a parasite.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	look at the civil rights movements.  Martin Luther King Jr. lead sit ins and marches.  the cops beat them up but they did not hit back.    there were even bombings of Martin Luther's home.  Love was all over him and in him because of Jesus Christ.    God loves us all too.  The devil hates and look where he is.|`|rkp6VmVaaa	yah totally|`|LCIcUTwNaa	I think hate is the stronger of the two.Love is free but hate consumes you.|`|nHi1mioBaa	yes,love is stronger than hate  because when you truly love some one  you would do anything for her,you can die for her  she's more important than yourself  if you dont have her,you have nothing  she's everything    but when you hate someone,  well.....i dont know how to explain the hate part  but yes,u get the point :)|`|oe81XFO0aa	This sounds like something out of A Wrinkle in Time. But anyway, depends on what you mean by stronger. Obviously Love and Hate don't have physical strength, but if you mean in terms of effectual strength, i'd say love would probably be stronger. The positive benefits of love are lasting, and help society as a whole become better. Hate only leads to destruction: the destruction of relationships, and the destruction of people on the inside. United we stand, divided we fall.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	no way man    it just isn't|`|P9K7AYmWaa	yes|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yes|`|h3rN7snkaa	I sure hope it is. How would the world function if it wasn't?|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	hate is inspired by hate, violence, or jealousy. love suppress all which is why love is stronger than hate|`|TsCMDYEkaa	Yes indeed !|`|bOgvUEzvaa	Love is a stronger bond, but hate is like a breeding ground and it spreads easily. Hate spreads way faster than love does.  You should totally listen to this song, I love it! :)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJpyskHMw...    You'll like the song! And who knows it could help answer your question :)|`|ILdgVBLGaa	no its not  love and hate are both emotions  and you cant have one emotion that is stronger than others  all of them are equal  love and hate included|`|R0XoFY6gaa	Yes love is much stronger that hate. It is so easy to hate, and love takes a lot of work, therefore making it stronger than hate. Love is courage, hate is fear. It's that simple.|`|98v2W0gGaa	doubt it.|`|S1TUEEm1aa	yes|`|hknqdnrtaa	Love conquers everything.|`|ycs7XAnXaa	i think so and hope :)|`|Bj8pnKNiaa	Yes. Hate achieves nothing. Love does.|`|40qRRVDWaa	yes naturally, think about it, have you ever hated someone and ended up being one of there friends? there is your answer.  If you hate your best friends gf you still are there best friend and you wont ditch them for that.  if you love someone truly, you will do anything for them.|`|DIkfJ4DRaa	uhhmmm i think hate stronger than love bcuz if u love someone   but someday you broke up or done something wrong   if you love someone there is some consequences that may have   problem to your relationship or something like that  -_-|`|ui5uEr5Oaa	no hate shall consume the world and arise to power and ultimately become our final demise and shall end all existence of man|`|9mxWNxktaa	Well i think love is stronger than hate but at times hate can be stronger but that's just jealousy does that help?|`|yldz3WmCaa	LOVE is most definitely stronger than hate, when you hate someone with a passion all you want to do is see them fail, but if they moved away you wouln't really care because they would be out of your life    but if you really love someone all you want is for them to be happy and acheive their dreams and when they leave you, you ache for them, you long for them. because they make you happy, and when your happy you can acheive anything.|`|FqyZRkYGaa	Strength is how you measure physical force.  Love and hate are both emotions, therefore not being able to be measured by strength.  That's trying to put a quantitative description to a qualitative property.|`|qKAYWhaMaa	love is stronger because hate just brings hatred love brings joy and happiess.|`|hOH33uBnaa	It takes no effort to hate something/someone. But it does take effort to love. Thus the power behind love is the effort made to give it. So love is stronger.|`|yUc6TFHyaa	yeah i think so..   me and this guy get into huge arguments about nothing.. but we always go back to each other in the end.. why because even though we are mad at each other we still love each other...    Love can over come almost all hills|`|qZNdKQPmaa	Yes

KEEVdrUpaa	asking your guy to call you at least five times a day is, in my opinion, asking WAY too muchhh!!  i wish i could help you out but i cant, i just feel like you have such high expectations and it sounds like your boyfriend is just over it...|`|cQSojmCJaa	well 5 calls a day may get annoying. i know you can feel sad but let a guy have some time to himself. he needs space, time for other people. at least text him but calling would get very annoying|`|O1WxKk7uaa	Maybe its cause your being a bit too clingy. He needs space just like all other people. But the best way to find out is talk to him ask him why hes doing that, if he still wants to be with you etc.|`|D4oVe5guaa	You need a psychologist, not answers on a message board. He might just be busy.|`|ISzhKvE8aa	wow ok...... lmao.  grow up -.- being in a relationship doesnt mean you have to call 5 times per day at a certain time planned -.-
tYhkdr63aa	would you say he's in your league?  if so then just talk to him.  ask him about what he's interested in and then ask details about it, and he'll just talk and talk about it.  he wont shut up even!  that's how we guys are.  then leave abruptly, cutting his story off at a good point so he wants more.    if he isnt in your league, then seem really sweet or something.  dont seem needy and dont do his homework. that will just make him think you're good to use as homework doer.      if he's slutty then flirt.    if he's quiet then you have to come on to him, dont be offended if he does something wierd. quiet guys are scared of communication.      see if he has an MSN/yahoo or some chat thing like that.  He will chat with you more openly and you'll get into more interesting and personal areas.
rfF6KHUkaa	No just tell them your going to your friends house for a sleepover, and come back the next day, or if you come back the same day say you got in a fight with her, or say you missed them to soften them up.|`|PdJRjwQJaa	To me, it sounds like you should be able to go no problem.  I know what you mean though, I've seen my parents do that to my brother.  Do you have a cell phone?  Tell that you will call or text them to keep in touch.  If the concert is on a school night then you will probably have a lot of trouble though. Good Luck!|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	here is the key word, CHILD, you used it yourself. "i have been a responsible CHILD all my life."<br>  <br>  you are still a child and no responsible parent would allow a child to go to a city as large as milwaukee with other children for an evening!!!  i have been to milwaukee and i would never allow a kid, or a bunch of kids to go there alone, without a parent with them!!!<br>  <br>  get a parent to go and i'm sure your parents would have a change of heart!|`|izFtmVCYaa	just explain everything u said here to them and say this will prove to them that u are old enough to handle small things like this.

Go Nickel back!! *HIGH FIVE* Anyways, now that that's out of the way, I'm just as lost as you are dude. I love my parents to death but they kind of strangle me. I think its for the better though, right? I mean, they love you enough. Or I could be totally wrong and they could just be doing it for fun.....Well good luck with attempting to convince! You may need it.......|`|DLgfVqWVaa	ask them to come with you, tell them they can have a date in milwakee while you attend the concert. this way they would know where you are going and you would get to see the concert. best of luck|`|fIoi3HWxaa	You can tell them you are responsible enough, and if they think not this is an excellent way to prove them wrong.<br>  <br>  You can make a deal with them saying you will text them every so often and keep them updated (obnoxious leash, i know, but hey its that  or nothing).<br>  <br>  Make sure they know and trust Danielle. They could have heard something negative about her from other parents that makes them skeptical. <br>  <br>  Also, promise you wont do anything stupid. Then stick to it so you can earn their trust. <br>  <br>  If they are just completely ignoring you with this because you are sixteen, then they need to wake up! Your a responsible and can handle yourself, let alone if you are with a friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24012ce93a61f006e2d2c809881dd85aaa	maybe have them speak with the girls parents, also, if they don;t know the girl, have her over to meet them. I don't see any other reason yu shouldn't go. Broker a deal with your parents- permission in exchange for chores, a signed contract of good behavior, which, if you violate, they can do whatever... try it|`|cvju4gONaa	Don't argue with them like a child but instead take the position that you are an "adult" that can be trusted. If you act like someone who is mature to handle what you are asking then they should be able to understand that you are growing up. <br>  16 That's not that young.|`|QyzvkJRQaa	Hah lol I live in Milwaukee:) Hmm... well they said no because they thought you were too young? Try a compromise saying maybe.. if you call and check in with them every once in awhile would they let you go?

A bunch of friends and I wanted to go see All Time Low who was playing only an hour away from my town, there was about six of us and I was going to drive down with my friend Ricky.<br>  <br>  I consider my parents to be very strict so it was a mircle that they let me go! I just told them was that I am very responsible and I have never given them a reason not to trust me before. Also they had never met Ricky so I had him come over to my house for dinner one night with my parents and me. Turns out they loved him! And they felt like they could trust me with him. So maybe have Danielle over your house to meet with your parents so they don't feel like they're letting you go to Milwaukee with a complete stranger. Just make it clear to them that you are becoming an adult and that they raised you well and should trust you to make the right decisions. Plus I don't know how many people you're going with but my parents liked the fact I was going with such a big group of people...they liked the idea of strength in numbers especially since I was going to a place that I had never been to before.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps! Good Luck!|`|SIO5DJXUaa	I've had similar situations with my parents. Basically, you must talk with them about the matter, and explain everything you've said up there ^, calmy.  If they still refuse to listen, it proves there is a lack of trust between yourself and your parents as I also, do not see any reason as to why you should not be allowed to go.  I'm not sure if you've ever done anything to break their trust in the past, but if you believe you havn't, ask them what you've done and if they are unable to come up with an answer, I would reinforce your arguement of having no reason not to go.  Often parents deny their children these kinds of things as they have had bad experiences of those situations in their childhood. Like my mum only lets me date boys of the same age as she believes any boy older will just use me, as she was abused by an older boy at my age. So basically, you have to prove they can trust you, that you have done nothing wrong and been loyal.  Set arrangements with them, timings etc, offer to call them when you arrive and leave to assure them your safe.  It's all about compromising.<br>  <br>  I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! Good Luck!|`|fW2NTGDWaa	Young man - You have a tough one on your hands here !! First off if your presenting yourself honestly here then you need to remind them of your credibility .

B7pyVYdRaa	honestly  nobody here is going to give you a good answer   talk to somebody close to you like a relative or a close friend     in my opinion though i think you should just play it by ear   things will work out on their own|`|8O4ttgGMaa	girl, stay broken up with him. college isn't fun while having a boyfriend! (im not saying skank yourself out) im just saying dont tie yourself down. senior year! you need to have fun flirting! it feels good to start talking to new guys|`|tG1vTi0Daa	its sounds like u just broke up with him to get a deep reaction out of him. maybe u dont really love him, since ur trying to get rid of him. if thats the case, uve changed ur mind. might as well start seeing other guys to keep ur mind off him. but if u feel it was a mistake, then maybe u made a big mistake.
kFzYAlJAaa	yesss regret will kill you  if you don't|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	Yes, IF:  -You're both single  -You're both of relatively close age (ie - you're NOT 30 and she's NOT 14)|`|3WeAfZNraa	yes.!!|`|G8WJ9ydqaa	Go for it!

Qe9rXFm0aa	Stick around....but in the background. She has already told you she is serious with someone else. Let her know you respect that.  Doesn't sound like they will last long...so keep in some kind of contact with her..be there for her if she needs it..and give her time to figure out the relationship she is in now.  But dont persue her, until she is done with this other guy. Let her chase you!|`|zGhDt3dpaa	Yea just wait it out and maybe in the future you will  have an opportunity with her. But remember; don't obsess over things that you cannot Control. If she wants to try to work out her current relationship then so be it. Just live your own life and let time do the work for you.|`|c32MJwDJaa	You should stick around so when he hurts her she has a shoulder to cry on.|`|0pqZsSRYaa	definitely stick around because right now, what she needs is a friend and you are the shoulder she needs to cry on. very soon she'll realize that you wouldn't do the things this other guy is doing to her.... let her learn to trust you, open her up, and let her learn to love you. be patient and it will all come.     but basically just be the best friend you can and i promise that will turn into more. don't make moves on her, just be there for her. and she will come running to you|`|CZdFWit7aa	I'd say you have a good chance. And when her relationship doesnt work out. You should be the first one there to comfort her.Dont rush it though. I think you may have a future with her.     Good Luck|`|5Dqin1Pdaa	well this sounds like a case of puppy love but i could be wrong . anyway if she cares so much about this dude that treats her wrong and everything she might feel insecure that she cant find anytone after him so just try to make her feel safe and loved whenever u are with her and have a little pacience she might finally realize she can do wayy better :)    good luck buddy ...|`|EXdiDbTTaa	Perfect chance, stick around, open her heart, let her trust you, and when her and her boyfriend breaksup, you will be there for her, you have to take care of her when she is hurt. she will start getting feelings for you, and then that will be the perfect time to ask her out (;
5sYfBSgJaa	So what if you called her a skank?! i call my sister a skank all the time. She is over reacting. What you need to tell her is so what if i called you a skank! get over it! then begin laughing histerically in her face and tell her that you remind her of a little kid. Ask her is she going to get mad if you say she has koodies? then get serious and tell her "yeah didnt think so. so if you really do have a problem its not about this 'Skank' 'Stick' issue" its because she has problems. Tell the world dpesnt revolve around her and to get over herself.|`|ubj2hZWZaa	just be the bigger women and apologize even though you did not do nothing bad.    sounds like somebody twisted your words.rumors>?|`|sdcx2clBaa	Bring out the cuss words on her.

Just you know be funny don't be all loud and proud bc then he will think your annoying and obnoxious and not want to be around you Second of all don't show off not like im saying you are just for future preferring and also you should just be who you are naturally and and...if you are who you are and not someone else then... he will like you for who u are... I got to make some changes hope it helped bye bye
AA11481862	as the old saying goes "picture the audience in their underwear"  although that doesn't help me at all....one minute will go by quickly than you can imagine! :) just have confidence, and instead of looking at the audience, look at the back of the wall in the room (if there is any) or just look at some random object and just talk to that. and before you know it, one minute will be over! gooood luck!! :))|`|AA11108018	Here is what you do write out your Speech and practice in front of the mirror.

Or at least try to, I know how you feel. Don't look at your paper if you have it, try to look at your audience. And put emphasizes and pauses to make it sound very realistic! Also, don't stutter, or try your best not to with no umm's or uhh's. That's my opinion.     Hope this helps. 8D|`|us7YBPIOaa	It helps if you memorize key facts and dont just look at the back of the wall fluctuate from the back to the corners
unVj43Xxaa	If he feels he has a problem with it and he says it's an obsession then perhaps the next step is going to get help. All guys look at porn but if he continually turns down sex with you for it then that's not something that will just change or get better on it's own. I'd try counseling and perferable someone that specializes in sexual addictions.|`|kbz5S3waaa	i understand why it makes you feel bad, especially the fact that you go to bed alone so that he can wack off to someone else rather than get something from you. It hurts me too, and really, at least in my experience, it's not a fight i choose to start, because it turns into one of the big ones. I don't mind if he looks at porn, just consult me first right? If i'm not in the mood, then wack it brother, but 99% of the time, i'm in the mood, and he just doesn't ask...???|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Porn is unhealthy if it is being used as a substitute for a healthy sexual relationship.<br>  <br>  If he's choosing computer images over the real thing for sexual release, he has a problem that needs to be addressed.  <br>  <br>  It is not unrealistic of you to expect him to turn FIRST to his wife for sexual satisfaction.  Porn should enhance your sex life, not replace it.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	All guys don't do it. Why does he do it when he can make love to you? It must be a sickness, addiction or compulsion. He is living in a fantasy world. He needs professional help. Something like AA for porn addiction. Do you really want to raise a kid in that household where the daddy is sitting in front of the computer jacking it off and creaming all over?|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Set up a password on your computer's security that will not allow adult websites unless entered.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Not all men do, but some men sure have convinced their wives of that. Sad. My husband doesn't, we have real sex instead.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pornaddicthubby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pornaddicthubby.com/</a>|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Yes, most men do look at porn in some shape, form or fashion....BUT not to this degree.  It really is an addiction for him and he's probably going to have to seek some outside counseling before he can ever quit.  Some folks may disagree with me, but a married man who watches porn almost every day of the week AND gets off on it has a serious problem.  It would be one thing if he watched it sometimes for some arousing fun then came to you for some intimate pleasure, but that's not what he's doing.  He may not "love" these women and I'm sure he really does love you, but apparently he does "love" his personal time with his porn more than getting the real thing.  Something is seriously wrong with that and I don't think he's going to be able to stop on his own.|`|rkFVxFb4aa	The thing is...you knew you had a problem with porn and still decided to be with him. It would be a COMPLETLY different story if this started after you've been together awhile. You still decided to have a child with him knowing this. He has a MAJOR problem, it's natural for all guys to look or want to look at porn every now and then, but everyday it's a serious addiction. I truly feel sorry for you.|`|lFL5W6jYaa	As you may know man are visual creatures the more stimulation from looking the happier they are. The porn will never leaceas long as he has eyes so get use to it. Just know that those are not real women and I'm pretty sure if he had a chance with any of them he more than likely wouldn't take it. But man do need to look or the will DIE!<br>  <br>  J.k.|`|64X5RxRbaa	Yuck some men are so sick and have no consideration for their wives.|`|dVlLahozaa	guys are pigs|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	You KNEW this about him BEFORE you married him, made a baby and now want to complain.<br>  Porn is disrespectful to a spouse in a marriage period.It makes them eventually feel unloved, unwanted,inadequate etc. especially when they act out on it.<br>  You have every right to feel the way you do,but you have no right to complain having gone into this marriage with your eyes wide opened hon.You can tell him the porn goes or you go.Hope he doesn't love the porn more.His love for porn will teach your sons women are sex things to be used as such and discarded, it will teach your daughter sthe ONLY value and worth they have  in order to be loved is to allow themselves to be used as sex toys.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Sounds like your husband has a pretty serious addiction to porn, which can lead to more severe acts of sexuality. You had better get him counseling soon. This is not normal behavior in a marriage, unless you enjoy it together.<br>  <br>  And to a lot of you who answered this. Not all guys do this. In fact the majority of men don't, especially if they are in a committed relationship. This can lead to serious problems in a relationship. This is an addiction, he needs to seek help. Sooner or later he will want to turn fantasy into reality, and he will seek it outside of the relationship.|`|aQB7IJcZaa	First, this may be a sign that your husband is not getting what he truly wants from you.  A lot of men, myself being one, get tired of having or needs rejected from our wives and look somewhere else for the release we need.  <br>  Many wives, have this I wont do this and I wont do this attitude, and if that is what you do, then your husband is just looking elsewhere to get this release from fantasy land.  If that is the case, as in mine, then watch out, he will eventually get what he needs from an outside source, as I did.  I am not proud of this fact but I am human.<br>  Now, if your husband, is looking a far out freaky abusive crap, degrading crap, and allot of the stuff out there is crap, then counseling and a serious consideration of your future is in order.|`|JppKTOPnaa	Well I'm a guy and I can say more than likely he has been doing this for a long time. Its a worse habit than smoking, and hard to break. Do you give head? Every day he does not  watch porn just give him some dome. I'm sure he would compromise with that on the table. And after the baby drops he will have allot of head time to make up for.|`|eawDlYHnaa	if you knew this about him, why would you marry and then get pregnant with him?? he probably has some sort of addiction and you should both seek counseling. this is pretty serious bc its just like any other addiction. i would not get over it. its one thing to let your man release himself and get off but its another if hes getting off to some chick online other than his wife!|`|ivyHOwZUaa	My husband is the same way. It bothers me sometimes but I know its just something he does. Men always crave sex more than woman but it is just something they do, seriously!! <br>  <br>  But try watching it with him cuz it will help you see it from a different perspective.|`|mMfWgm38aa	There is this movie with Kirk Cameron called fireproof.  Watch it with him, you won't regret it.  It kind of addresses your problem|`|40dv9U9Baa	No not all guys do, but seriously he needs to stop before it has an affect on the child you'll have, think about what your child will think if she or he saw hers or his father watching porn|`|TXaMOQo6aa	not all guys do it, only most|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	S most of guys are doing the same... i think this is normal to guys|`|65m62rDraa	Most men watch some sort of porn, whether it is every day, or once in a while. It has nothing to do with love. It simply arouses them - like a game, or an addiction, as your husband says. Although you are feeling disrespected, and you hate when he does it, I can promise you he does not feel he is disrespecting you, and hurting your feelings. It sounds like he needs to find himself some hobbies, keep busy with productive activities, and spend some time with you. Take him out, find some things|`|Gmi5p8HIaa	Sounds to me like he needs counselling, because despite the fact that you told him how you feel about it, he still continues.  I've been with my fiance for over a year now, and during this time I caught him masturbating to porn two times.  The first time I told him it made me feel worthless and I will dump him if he continues.  We had a long chat and it didn't happen for a long time.  The second time he tried to hide it from me, but I found out, I asked him why and he said that he felt he doesn't please me enough and just needed to relax.  I told him you do please me EVERYTIME, but that I am leaving because him watching porn and masturbating to it is not only an insult to me, but also an insult to our relationship.  He immediately threw ALL his dvd's and magazines away and said he's sorry for not coming to me about how he was really feeling.  SO, if your husband loves you, he WILL stop watching it.  Love is much more powerful than Lust.  And we have a wonderful sex life now...  :-)|`|MhVuie0Jaa	Most guys do it and yes, if it's an addiction, it's has nothing to do against you. The problem is it just steals your husband's time and affection from you. And you're not alone in the feeling of inadiquacy or in hating it, even in other case where the man is a boyfriend. (Although some women don't mind with their own reasons) <br>  How stop it? "You" can't but your husband can - with your help - if he desires to do it and get professional help. The initial steps really has to come from him because with addiction like this is hard to break just by staying away because porn is everywhere with easy access to them wherever you are.<br>  With the way you feel about it right now, I don't think it's easy for you just to forget or just get over it without putting stress on your relationship. But then again, if you can, make sure resentment won't arise from it.<br>  Goodluck girl.|`|cb6ToDZYaa	It's time for your husband to grow up.  Using the "addiction" excuse is just pathetic.  If it's truly an addiction, tell him to go to counseling.  If I seem angry, it's only because you just described my first marriage.  It hurt so much, and no matter how you stack it, it's cheating, it's degrading to you, and you deserve more from the man that dedicated his life to you.  You have a child on the way, so you need to tell him his time to be the child in the house is over.  You deserve for your husband to make you feel beautiful, especially when your pregnant, and if your anything like me, his need to look at other women make you feel like your somehow inadequate - like you just not enough.  It's just cruelty at it's worst.  In answering your question, i am in my second marriage now with a man who can't get enough, OF ME.  No, not all guys do this when they are married and have a child on the way.  I don't know what you can do to make it stop, or if you even can.  If this is what he wants to do, he'll find a way to do it.  What I do want to say is that you need to hang on tight to your self esteem.  Don't let him make you feel less than you are.  You are his wife, and now you are the mother of his child - you deserve all of his attention, don't you?|`|uDEaQ4uXaa	Get over yourself. He has every right to look at whatever he wants and to do whatever he wants to his own body.<br>  <br>  You hate it because you want to control his sexuality and you can't stand it that he has something in his life that he derrives pleasure from that doesn't involve you. The universe is not all about you. This is nothing like smoking as this doesn't harm anyone. You just don't like the fact that he gets enjoyment from something that you are not involved in.
J14tPA9Eaa	uk= united states with bad teeth
AA10025781	age does matter. in about a year he will be 18 and it will be illegal to date your friend. and guys at that age are looking for sex, and a lot of it. so she better be prepared to fend him off unless she wants to risk getting pregnant. if you still have a bad feeling about him when he turns 18 you can always turn him into the cops. but thats kind of a mean thing to do. this whole thing could be bad but it'd be better if you did something to protect your friend instead of sitting by waiting for her to get hurt. don't be a bystander.|`|97e5af975d0ce2df46e943e7aee67ea7aa	either let her know your concerns and fears about her boyfriend .....or just let it go....what you do will determine how true of a friend you are so think about or seek an adults opinion.......|`|utQC6dhjaa	honestly she's gonna do what she wants  ive been in this case many times and in the end its your friends choice.   all you can do is be there for you   you can voice your opinion but if she doesn't like it your gonna have to back off.  its hard but thats all you can do
HmKY6qZDaa	Yes. It can be if the person is WICKED busy and wants to focus on that stuff-NO offense. But if hte relationship is strong then maye they just want to focus on other things but sitll likeyou|`|WtNW8HcPaa	Sometimes it's a valid reason...if a person doesn't have time to devote to a relationship then it's hard to maintain that relationship. It just makes things more stressful. While it can be a valid reason I think that it's often used more as an excuse for not being honest with someone about the real reason they are breaking things off. It truly depends on the person, their lifestyle and the time/effort they put into their relationships. I doubt I would want to be with someone who is extremely busy - there isn't a whole lot of time spent together, which makes it's hard to develop an intimate relationship...
6QIpltVyaa	their maybe some underlying issues he may have not talked to you about, but he did apologize ... everyone is unique in the apologizing game...but since you guys didn't talk for 2 months and now lets say he wants to talk don't give him the chance of "availability" ....you have your pride too... :)
cov3zaiEaa	well...you should be just as you are.. :   you can say this:    Hi..! i think you are pretty and super cool... i would like to be your friend =) i'm a little bit shy.. but then i am super funny! =) i hope we talk then... bye! =)      you can say that in myspace.. in school you can say hello to her.. and talk her about you last best friend and stuff.. good luck!"

UZ2nix6xaa	Don't be discouraged because he said no to your friend. My girlfriend said the very same thing to one of her friends but it turned out she really liked me... personally I didn't care what she said to one of her friends and asked her out anyway, I felt it was definitely worth the risk. So if he's admitted to his friends he likes you, there's a good chance he does.    Good Luck.|`|Xz2EQusraa	He probably said no cuz it would be awkward and he was probably annoyed but with her not you so go 4 it|`|zLsA6IAPaa	talk to him|`|AA11173575	Who knows. Probably because of what your friend did.|`|b8g9gWE0aa	yea your friend just totally messed up!! put yourself in his shoes... would you like it if his friend kept bugging you to go out with him.... its embarrassing/annoying... i think your best bet now is to just straight up talk to him and tell him yourself. You never meant for your friend to do that and you didnt know she was going to do that but that you do like him and would want to hang out someday. good luck!!

lXVwGgHmaa	usually the girl can't but her friends can. and theyve most likely talked to her about it (because thats all girls talk about in the first place) so she probably knows and if shes talking to you alot then she probably likes you too
ts8nRQXnaa	Don't worry so much, you should read the book:   He's Just Not That Into You    by Greg Behrendt    It will answers many relationship questions, and the book is very enjoyable to read. i hope you read it , and hopefully it helps
DzXDJCfZaa	Well before you ask her out, go hangout with her at the movies or something. You can have your friends go and she can have some of her friends go- this can aleviate you being nervous. As the night goes by you should be able to tell if she has any interest in you or not. If you feel that she likes you, then just ask her out

He has beat you up without causing a major black eye, so you go and beat him up causing a bit more damage to him because you are mad, then he takes revenge on that beating and inflicts major wounds to you...where does it end?

I managed to perfect the art of retribution.     I'd wait until he wasn't expecting it, and I'd whomp him - most of the time when he was drinking something. I'd subsequently get beaten up - again - but after about 5 or 6 times, he realized he'd be a lot more comfortable if he left me alone!     I now absolutely, positively do NOT condone that behavior! While it worked, it was a little pig-headed of me. The best thing to do is to let it pass, and calmly tell him the next time he even thinks about it, he'll will not be safe doing anything without the threat of something happening to him, and you'll make sure they'll have trouble identifying him at the morgue, if they even find him.....    Again - I'm just kidding.

LZzsDARUaa	if u loved her then u will feel an emptiness that she is gone, so it's ok 2 feel sad, plus this tragedy kind of ruined ur birthday and holidays 4 the next years, so maybe u won't be really cheery each year on ur b'day and christmas      hope u will feel better..but don't worry, the main thing is 2 remember ur mother in  a good whay..:)
R4ttUPAjaa	He's probably only saying it because he thinks it's something that you want to hear. Most guys will just say to get what they want from their ladies or to make them happy. Just tell him that you don't need those words to be happy with him and you really want to see how the relationship progresses before you make the commitment that comes with saying those three little words. Good luck!|`|CKWABfYIaa	ya a boy said he loved me on a text message n dat im irreplaceable but if u send i love u bak it may send him the wrong signals of how much u like him because i told the boy i thought he cute n he kept tryin get me away from my friends n in corners and rooms by myself wit him so be careful wat u tell him.
T6nmD3X9aa	depends what kind of work you do...  dating is tricky because there is sooo much tourism there, many times you will meet a girl who will only be there a week or two. But the locals are cool too.    good luck with the move!|`|tY4hOjqdaa	There are some local hotties but are far and few....but on the alternative side the weather is great!
lXVwGgHmaa	keep talking to her maybe even a little more than before but dont go for her right away. give her a little bit of time to get over her exboyfriend (like a week) then go for her
dNJG3EDCaa	Don't do it. If hes willing to dump a girl for you, then he is willing to dumpyou for another girl.
0QRTXIL2aa	No man! just wait it out! you are amazing that you have waited this long. i tried but it didnt work. sex is amazing, wait til you wedding night and it will feel a million times better than a BJ. even if she tries, tell her, 5 months is not that long and it will be even more special. especially since you dont want to worry about getting her pregnant before the wedding and all, every woman will worry about that after her first time, no matter how much protection. just wait, you wont regret it.    and congrats!|`|AA11032806	I say do it. You both waited for a long time, you're getting married soon, and besides, you guys are 23! You're mature enough to do it and you guys are getting married so you must love each other. Good luck!|`|CLvUYnRRaa	Personally I think you 2 should wait, because what you 2 are doing is something you rarely hear so it'll make it more magical. But if you do decide to go ahead and get it on, remember to take it slow, steady, and listen to her body. If you do those things, you will last longer, she will be hooked, and it shows how much you care.       P.S. Keep mixing it up and keeping it new, tease her a little and please her a lot.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	u know..my personal opinion is for y'all to wait. yes valentines day is a nice holiday but is it really special to y'all? will it mean as much as it would to do this on your wedding night??    people put alot of perceptions and "dreams" on there wedding and usually its the imperfection of it all that makes it special to them...    and when u do it, go slow, u know her body well so, go slow, learn and make room for mistakes...be prepared as u can be..like have the condoms ready, and lubricant and a tip for men..um they say u should masturbate before hand...makes u last longer and takes some pressure off..|`|ql0RmOLiaa	hmmm it would be really sweet to waight....but really spontanious to go early....so i say go early cuz this isnt the 40s and spontanious is hottttttt!|`|iLk1LRz1aa	I'd say do whatever you feel is right at that moment. I wouldn't get your hopes up about it happening on Valentine's Day, but if it does and it feels right, then I say go for it! If you don't have your hopes up and it DOESN'T happen that night, then you don't have to worry.    I respect your decision!|`|CG4BVkWVaa	i think if you guys have gone as far as oral then you have a pretty open sexual relationship, i guess it would be cool if you waited, but since its long distance right now i see why you would want to. My advice is see what she has to say about it, if she really wants to then i would let her, but if she is unsure at all, it is only five months.|`|U22nd6Aaaa	If you both want to then I think you should. You're consenting adults and with the history you've had it's not really doing that much more.    Nobody can really answer this question but yourselves though. Just go with what feels right for both of you when you next see eachother.|`|AA11640559	You might as well wait it out.  You've already waited this long.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	why haven't you had sex yet?  but you think oral and manual with sex toys is ok? People like you don't make any sense.|`|r8owV9esaa	oh wait it out!! its most likely worth it.. make it memerable|`|iD4ejChZaa	stop it now, repent, and be moral before God. you still need Jesus in your lives.|`|Lp2FNrb7aa	its up to you, depends on the moment and how things progress. it might be nice to wait till ur wedding night but then if you are drinking or anything you may have problems. or you might feel really horny when you see her on valentines day and decide to go for it. just wait and see, and see what she thinks/has planned. either way its still gonna be special.|`|71VRvldJaa	Is there a reason to break our commitment to abstain?    No!, absolutely there is NO reason to break it!..... prove to each other that when you make a committment to each other, you honour that committment!  If you can't honour this one, how many other committments will you break once you are married!  You've waited this long......5 more months isn't going to kill you!|`|JmMrgtGqaa	just do whatever you two feel confortable with. You are going to get married, but if there are any possible doubts about your relationship failing befor marriage, you shouldnt, only in comitted relationship.|`|pFslPbkaaa	I'd say wait it out.  It will make things more passionate on your wedding night, especially since you have waited this long already.|`|P38ULZbraa	I think you should continue to wait, it will make it all that much better! Imagine, having sex with your WIFE, not your fiance... good luck[:|`|wE2etBzbaa	you are not abstaining if you have oral or hand.   what a trick,  you think god got tricked by this?  what kind of god get tricked by this?    if it is up to me, I don't abstain. dick is investment, and time is money|`|5XzeOF9Iaa	just do it. . . ur close enough already
s5d2VFVQaa	no. if you are interested just ask to go get something to eat/drink after work. if you sexually harass you could lose you job and get sued...|`|WIczM4URaa	get counselling.|`|a8a9triNaa	NO!|`|uz0R5pjHaa	NO!!! are you crazy?!?! you could get really screwed for that. You could like lose your job, get sued, or even jail. + if you did that and some one found out then... i don't think you want the pressure on the shoulders. so, make good choices :D    Hope it helps  Best answer :D
AA11032806	Off course you can't. Everyone grows up at different rates. Forcing someone won't help, it will complicate the problem even more.|`|VIDh3oUVaa	depends on what u refere on becoming a man.... but obviosly the answer is no..|`|JZkCVHJAaa	can't really force any body to do anything like potty training they do it when they are ready|`|sgRDJUXqaa	You can't force a boy, man, girl, woman, or person to do anything if they're not ready.  They'll only resent you for trying.|`|5LEE91CGaa	i actually thought that the original question was good. the add. detail was unnecessary. but ready how? and you must consider that there is a lot to be considered when becoming man. besides being wasted.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	Well we've come to unified decision....No|`|f30a506a8cabe4e06fa0380441990cb2aa	you can NEVER force someone to be something they are not ready to be hun, but you can try to talk to him about being more mature.|`|Ne9ovJRTaa	no. and why would you want to change someone? only they can change themselves.
Uq6r7ukvaa	He interested in you according to me
QqiuPbQCaa	just go and talk to him he might just be afraid to come and talk to you  well he might just be liltile shy   trust me   i am a guy and really shy and there is     girl i like form my class but i just cannot go and talk to her i don't know y but i really find it difficult to talk to  her   so go and talk to him   sometimes girls have to take first step tht is only if you really like him|`|iH4kN8ltaa	Just talk to him. Talk about something you have in common.|`|hcglX1wnaa	i m ready... dude.... i m waiting ur reply....|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Looking out for the other guy is the best option.
OuOOy8v3aa	If you think you will cheat then don't get with her, say you don't want to rush things because you only just got out of a relationship.  Then have fun and get with her.
kA1mYSOtaa	It's not creepy at all. As friends, you tend to find the same basic type of guy. On top of that, you are probably "bff's" because you have very similar personalities. Of course it's not on purpose. When two friends are as close as you two are, you get to learn together...to grow together. I don't know about any of these guys you date, but I will tell you that as you get older, you should do everything in your power to maintain this friendship. You'll be the best link to each others past and the ones most likely to stick together - through thick and thin - in both the near (and distant) future. I say good for you in that regard. I hope you find happiness so that the two of you can celebrate it together...for the rest of your lives.|`|sEP0mC9aaa	first of all its PURPOSE    secondly. no it is not weird. you are just similar people|`|esDZc2cVaa	i think yall are just really best friends...and closer the friendship more things happen the same...that's what i hear...and i hope you do get back with your x..and i hope emily stays with her man...and the first 3 answers..yall are nasty assholes!!!that have 3 sums together..yall are bitches!!!!!|`|hVULX6A4aa	yes very odd|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	I think you need to get a job.|`|berYSEW7aa	maybe you secretly stalk her every move|`|c6Cw7DqRaa	I really don't know, or care.   One piece of advice though, go to school... learn to spell.|`|AA10172823	www.comg.com  www.milfhunters.com  www.barbie.com  www.69.com  www.efukt.com  www.meatspin.com  www.2gu1r51cup.com  www.barney.com  www.welivetogether.com|`|j6PrOaZgaa	haaaa thats weird!! but kinda cool!!!    well i dont know the situation between you and your ex but it he deserves to be with you then maybe call him uppp!!|`|MRVoQssdaa	Ha kinda creepy. But you know what they say things happen in threes.  1.getting dumped  2.finding someone new.  and  3.getting back together with  1.    I hope you get what you want.    and ii do think you will :]|`|24b0qkPbaa	LOL CREEPY|`|ifVqaPsxaa	maybe its all planned out...next time look for the hidden cameras and wait for the people to pop out and say "you just got punk'd!"|`|0mcvCOfyaa	That was a bit hard to follow, but i guess it means that you are just meant to be best friends. Enjoy that.|`|OwfoyXpraa	just a coincidence..|`|gIaQ7Y4oaa	"Perpus" is spelled Purpose, learn english, stop using so many ellipses and why are you complaining? I mean, you and your best friend do the exact same thing, whats troubling you? You guys share experiences, talk about it, have a slumber party and do whatever it is girls do in slumber parties.|`|u3sw0LMpaa	creepy-coincidence; but maybe its just the way things happen. You probably could get together with him again, but not because your friend did because its the way things happen =) Peace on earth =)|`|OrFYRg27aa	Have you ever heard of girls who live together all getting their periods at the same time? It's the same theory. As you and your best friend get closer, your personalities become more similar and your actions and the actions of people around you start to become more and more the same. It just goes to show that the two of you were made to be best friends. Hope all works out with you're ex. |`|y9mdCYByaa	i think....it's pure accident. get over it. don't think that another person is in control with your destiny. your life depends on the choices that you make.|`|IJTcXbvdaa	3 sum?|`|XzkvqTyxaa	i don't know|`|5cmThMszaa	hahahahahahahaha.|`|HcjCdLehaa	Thaz weird. a coincidence prolly. thaz kinda cool too :D|`|yaXOTETnaa	its nothing and that doesnt effect u and ur x|`|M0iR7JIxaa	???? very retatarted!!!!!!|`|fKmazW49aa	1.pics or it didn't happen  2. **** or gtfo|`|3YfYWpAsaa	Just a luck of the draw... also when shes with a guy you feel the need to have a guy too, since she naturally has a little less time to have fun with you, and is spending more time w/ her guy    So you will probly get a new b/f since you will want to replace the time you lost with her, since she has a b/f too    also, girls are (even subconsciously) jealous and competitive beings    So.... who knows? one of these reasons, most likely|`|OauMuKofaa	My friend and I are like that. It's such a coincidence that my friend's name is also Emily. I think it's just that we have something in common and we face the same problems. It just makes the friendship even more special. Who knows, maybe it will happen to you too. But it might not. So don't let your hopes up and just go with the flow (:|`|Y7RVUZ9Yaa	I think its just a coincidence, I don't think it'll guarantee you'll get back with your ex, but still hope it tho! Hope that those coincidences keep occurring!|`|o2LC0yXKaa	I wouldn't rely on it. I'd just go with the flow if I were you. People who really want something usually don't get it. Let it come to you.    at least that's what I do and I always seem to win in card games.|`|AA11462348	A bit.  But,if you want to get back with your X its all about if u actually try  Maybe, if you don't want to get back with your x u shouldn't   just don't  Maybe the reasons for this is because you copy your friends actions making everything the same.....|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	in your one sentence you said i hope so it sounds to be like you are doing this on purpose nothing personal but you wanna be just like your friend emily       you said she is back together with her ex you said will you and   i hope so
lXVwGgHmaa	he deffinatly likes you. he might just not be going for you because of the age thing but if him and his girlfriend break up then hell probably come after you|`|LsDdJlDgaa	herm,i think he only playing with your feeling.leave him.|`|fElrYibYaa	hes a cheater and just wants to get in your pants|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Keep him as a friend. Isn't he a bit old for you?|`|9c8B2IKwaa	Go ask him!|`|8E59Idahaa	I reckon you should stay friends with him.  Being good friends with guys can be really great, because you dont get a chance to have boy as a friend everyday!    Even though you really like him, these situations tend to go pear shaped if you start going out with him or hooking up with him.  Lots of the time the guy ends up cheating cause he can't dump his girlfreind but can't help himself with you ect ect  and it can be a lot of stress and it will cause trouble for the both of you.  but,still, your choice!    good luck.    xx|`|HcjCdLehaa	He likes you for sure. Kiss him and see what happens:D never know until you try! And trust me, Relationships and Dating are my specialty. Can't go wrong:P|`|Fc9E4uGWaa	You should talk to him about it...be like do you like me?|`|PFXpmQgYaa	girl, im really sorry, but hes playing you. im a senior, and have dated guys like him before. i know youve probably heard this before, but SERIOUSLY, he just wants to get some. If he wanted you for anything else, he would have broken up with his gf already. im sorry :(|`|YekLLS2Yaa	maybe he thinks of you as more of a 'sister' or a friend?    But then again it really all depends on the girlfriend  You don't want to have him cheat on her, that would be terrible  And follow your reputation forever.    It's a possibility, but I'm not exactly sure.|`|aCJtsgrRaa	yup he definitly likes u.. but make sure tat u reely kno dis guy.. cuz like u said he has a girlfriend.. u never kno wats reely on his mind .. just be careful :)|`|ff4fdc55e4134a54a6545ed164302405aa	Why would you want a boy who would cheat on his girlfriend and then dump her for you?  Stay out of the puppy love mess and tell him to stop paging you or you will tell his   girlfriend. The most I would do is to keep him as a distant friend  a very distant friend.|`|biiAAZqtaa	If he was truly interested in pursuing a relationship with you then he wouldn't have a girlfriend while courting you. He might be into you now but if she ever frees up you're going to take the backseat to her and I don't think that's what you want. Besides, it's the classic saying, "if he does it to her he'll do it to you too."|`|QQd8wdLDaa	dont do it.  im a freshman too and the thing is older guys just want to have sex with you and they think your easy because your a freshman. ikik hes not like that blah blah blah but trust me, they all turn out to be the same. i dated this guy for 3 years, he broke up with me 6 times and i believed him everytime that he would change but he was just using me to have sex with him. ive had the same problem and dont do it. theyre really convincing and another thing is that this guy is either 18 or almost 18. thats illegal. dont do it trust me dood.
zGhDt3dpaa	well u cant help the way you feel. But u have to be fair to your boyfriend. Even if u don't mean to hurt him, that will hurt him very badly if he knew u liked someone else. If you find that this crush continues to grow and it affects the way you act toward ur bf then u need to do something. Are you in love with your boyfriend?|`|6a4027d3805f56239709dd808ba97b3aaa	live ur life..do what u feel u should do!!!:)  if u wana go out with him, just do and if u need to break up with ur bf just do it...if ur already flirting with other guys ur not in love with ur bf...|`|WL1cX9rTaa	my x  define about everything  did the same bullshit  its rude  dump your boyfriend  ur hurting you man  you slut
6d417dae3ad39a233d21b6c5ded7e833aa	you have put a lot in the relationship for all those years and it is true you  might still love him but it is on you rather you will let him go and protect your heart from him because of his ways or if you two keep coming back to each other fight for him no matter what FIGHT,fight for him if you care fight to see if there is anything still there talk to him tell him how you feel  about the situation tell him what in your heart i know he might act a little  immature being a male and not wanna man up but that's ok if there,s nothing there that,s ok too at least he knows how you feel and to answer you question yes you can let go b/c i did it i got over him and my heart healed yours can too and  if he does not want you someone better will but if he does i wish you the best hope i helped God Bless|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	Trouble gave you some AWESOME references.    From experience I can tell you, letting go is the only thing you can do for your own recovery. It is a very painful process and it will feel very uncomfortable because change is uncomfortable. You have to learn to love yourself through the pain. Be gentle with yourself as you are grieving a huge loss. Do not get caught up in the illusion that if you just endure this behavior from your husband for the sake of your marriage, he will change. He has to be willing to be completely honest with himself and with you before he can even begin to take the steps nessesary to change. And YES you do deserve honesty. It sounds like he is still caught up in his own lies and incapable of true intimacy. All you can do is let go (a day at a time) and pray for him...period. you are just as powerless over him and his behaviors as you were your drugs...fact. Read Acceptance pp449 in the big book until you internalize this.    Resentment is our  1 enemy...forgiveness is hard but you will find it on your journey if you just stay close to yoru Higher Power...hold on to Him for dear life..your sanity depends on how well you practice spiritual principles. I hope you find peace.|`|CP1VYev4aa	Because you love him.  Sometimes it hurts to love someone, regardless how they feel about you.  You have alot invested (17 years) so i can see how hard it is to let go. Keep trying to help him, but take care of yourself too. Sorry you are in this. i know it really really stinks.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Sometimes, we don't let go because we get comfortable  and don't want to change our lives, no matter how miserable we are.  You are already separated, so move on. It sounds like its time for both of you.  M|`|fE5bC83Saa	you both shouldn't have dated others in the first place.be tolerant and make him feel you are his best friend again  good luck|`|KnMdFqq0aa	Good for you that you are recovering. This is a long hard road and being with someone who is still using is very difficult.     You also seem to have codependency issues. Please go to www.hazelden.com for some good reading and advice...they have daily emails that have some great things to keep you on track.     Next, get the book Codependent No More and Language of Letting Go, both by Melody Beatty.     Look up Joyce Meyer ministry for some even better advice on coping with life and all the bs that is thrown at you. She is GREAT, even if you are not "religious"    You need to break free...you are at the path where you have 2 roads...you will forever be tied to your past addiction by staying with him.     Good luck to you and please check out the references I gave you..I know they will help!|`|91sBjTtAaa	its hard to let go you have history togeather but for your own sanity you need to move on

4T7L1S7Vaa	There is every chance he could like you like that again.. but he also might not..    I've been there with my best friend... and we ended up being on and off as "friends" and "more than friends" for ages, which i don't advise!    Try to be patient and not pressure him, but at the same time be as caring and loving as a best friend can be. With lots of hugs! And then he might come around to the idea of you as more than friends by himself. But either way it sounds like he could use his best friend very much there right now!      I hope that helps! Good luck!! :)
wHL0Jw23aa	Take it slowly. Stop yourself when you think of him focus on other things getting involved at school and and other activities really helps. Find something to keep u busy.

q5TgBFdtaa	I understand where your coming from. I'm the same age as you and I never had a boyfriend. I also have more guy friends than girls. Sometimes I feel insecure about myself and tell myself i'm not pretty....Love comes to people even when they're not looking for it. Your a very pretty girl, i'm sure find the one your looking for in no time. As for I, well I guess I'll just keep looking myself. :p    P.s. don't worry about it too much, you'll stress yourself out!|`|8h2P3Gyyaa	well you and i have the same problem, but i am 20 and i only had one boyfriend. I can feel what you are saying too. i always get guy i don't like never the guy i like. it sucks!    Any way you should talk to guys you are interested in. Be  more outgoing when talking to guys they really notice when girls have a lot of confidence in them self. Smile and flirt with the guy you like. When i say flirt i mean a playful flirt meaning hugging, smiling at each other, etc....Also make sure the guy is feeling you too before you flirt with him too. I hope this helps.|`|8qydwT6kaa	yeah wat they said ....  dont worry about it too much....  most guys blind and cant see some one beautiful in front of them....  my friend has the same problem ...  she is really stressed out by it..  i help her so much     i told her what i am telling you right now...  so dont worry your perfect match will come for you soon..  just be patient..  p.s. most high school guys are imature.  :]|`|gfksposqaa	It's because you're 15 and your options are pretty much limited to the guys at your school.    Don't sweat it, you're pretty and will have no problem as you're exposed to more new people.
x0KszFPMaa	first, ask yourself what you did to make her hate you. there are some things that girls just don't let go of. like if you broke her heart by hooking up with her then dumping her or hooking up with her friend. but yea, i guess you could try to be nice to her and make her feel special
ULSxEr4caa	The question is, who will take care of her daughter when she goes to school for real? I honestly would not do it. Who knows, if this works out well she might end up looking to you for future babysitting stints.

p9DW7iRfaa	For every guy in the universe (no guy would disagree with me here), it is sexy for a girl to take the lead. Like, it's fine if you ask a girl to something, but if she does that herself, it's a major turn on for any guy.|`|stv1JMXNaa	Honesty, trust, confidence, and beauty. If a girl is completely honest with me, I like that, and that's where the trust comes in. If she's honest with me, I know I can trust her and I like that. A relationship is mostly about trust, if you cant trust the person with you're life, then you shouldn't get into a serious relationship with them. If a girl is confident with herself, us guys really like that. Like if she has good self esteem and is confident about most things she does. Beauty, that's only a plus. Most guys who aren't jerks don't even care if a girl is really beautiful, because to them, she is beautiful in her own way, and we love it. Hope this helped :)|`|CEqYjcBeaa	Being the aggressor is probably number one. A girl that is confident, knows what she wants and how she wants it, and isnt afraid to tell her man..now thats hot. I love lip biting, its semi casual, just look him in the eyes and bite your lower lip a little. Here is one of my favorites, slip on something sexy, sit on the other end of the couch and just stare at him as you begin to touch yourself.
4T7L1S7Vaa	It's definitely on the verge of being more than friends.. I was in a really similar situation with me best friend (a girl) for a long time, and it led to some very messy stuff!    If you dont want to be anything more than friends, then you should make sure he knows that... because he could very easily think that its building to something more. He could be head over heals before you know it!    But, if you do want to be more than friends it sounds like it's developing perfectly! :)      Best of luck!|`|WmM3XeLPaa	I think it's being pushed a bit.....  Do you have any feelings for him? Ask yourself some questions. But I definitely think that it is being pushed farther down the path....|`|ubj2hZWZaa	that is your unique relationship that you two have developed.  as long as it is okay to you both then that is that.|`|2VT07B4Kaa	I was in the same situation me and my best friend ( a girl ) always used to do wat u did so we talked about it and we started going out
jLKcuMNraa	well this isn't a big way but its cute for a sweethearts thing.  put a red heart in a small bucket of water then put it in the freezer.  when its frozen give it to your boyfriend and attach a paper that tells him to melt it.  when it melts, the message on the heart should say "now that you've have melted my heart will you go to the dance with me?" just a suggestion
vjxroyxjaa	No not at all. I think it's great that u luv sports. I luv sports and i luv girls that luv sports too. I highly doubt that that is the reason. Maybe they r just afraid that u might kick their butt and r better at some sports than they r;) In any case, keep it up with the sports- theyre fun and they keep u in shape.  Best of Luck  -Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.com|`|jeHTjvbaaa	I LOVE girls who play sports!  There are not enough of them who don't look like guys though... =(  But the runner/soccer players are always pretty hot and can keep up with with me too =P|`|dm9evixvaa	i really like that. since i like sports too it would be a really easy thing to relate about.|`|JaXIaOn1aa	I LUV sporty girls
K35Tuf1oaa	She probably does not want to pay to have her car parked at an aiport lot while she is gone. My friend has asked me to do this for him too when he has gone on trips. I do it for him, because I know that he would return the favor for me if I needed similar help. That is what friends are for. What you need to ask yourself is 'is this something she would be willing to do for me if I needed it?'  If so, then you should take her to the airport. We should be willing to go out of our way sometimes to help out our friends. And if she is an especially good friend, maybe she will buy you a drink or some lunch next time you hang out as a way of saying thanks, but don't expect her to do that.|`|cYf5IacRaa	If you don't want to, then just tell her nicely that you don't want to. Good luck! :)|`|AA11814087	If you don't want to or wish to do this, then tell her. Be honest with her.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	And your question is what.  I picked a friend up at her house at 3:30AM last weekend so that I could drop her off at the airport by 5AM.  When she thanked me I said I was raised to believe that that is the type of thing you do for friends.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	What is your question? All you need to figure out is if you want to take her or not. You're not being a bad friend just because you don't want to do something. I mean you don't have to do everything your friends ask you to do. Just yes or no.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well,, are you a friend or not? It's expensive to leave your car at the airport. You could ask her to drive to your house if it's geographically appropriate. Or you could just tell her to ask a better friend.
Ks6Ac9SSaa	I'm not going to say it's wrong, but it is considered a public place so when you do it be considerate of others that might be in there, especially children.    Have fun!    Wow someone living on the edge!|`|71VRvldJaa	Keep in mind most stores have some form of security camera recording activities in the dressing rooms.  But since you're not interested in hearing about any of this, I won't bother to mention that your little romp in the change room could end up on tape and you could both end up being charged!...............but that would be pretty erotic wouldn't it?.......having a cop slap handcuffs on you when you're in the middle of doing the deed!|`|tQnE8PPTaa	Get a cheap hotel room for the day :)|`|zlFeUyrOaa	well lets see where should I start lol,,,,,,well if u have a JC PENNYS they are good along with kmart is good also so good luck|`|AA11108018	Most dressing rooms have an opening at the top and they do watch to see who goes in the room  Here's one I had her sneak me in the ladies room and she sat on lap in the stall she  sat forward with her legs crossed little tight but lots of fun
dWHSmESNaa	Advice: Don't Date|`|AA11263103	read a book. duh of course your bf likes you!!!! just life your childhood and then when your not asking people that are in high school about you and your bf.|`|ecd5b22a3f931f907d69a5b7daa4b25caa	THIS IS THE HIGHEST RATED SUGGESTION FOR 11-12 YEAR OLDS!                 DON'T DATE YET, WAIT FOR WHEN YOU CAN DRIVE  BECAUSE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND!|`|Z4B93N31aa	go to bed   kiddy  youre too young (:|`|SyHmExgtaa	You're a child and there is plenty of time for dating once you mature..as for now...go enjoy your innocence and act like the child that you are...
0aH1KvbEaa	Pretty sticky situation man. It's one thing if she doesn't like the relationship she's in but you said she's been dating him for afew years.. that's like.. serous. Obviously she isn't having relationship problems.. at least nothing major.     If you want to still be friends with her I would almost say don't say anything but.. thats not really fair to you. And it will probably eat at you. There is another thing you need to look at before you say anything.. is it that you really do love her or that you just want her because you can't have her. People want what they can't have and once they get it..it isn't as special anymore.    I'm not saying that's your issue here but just make sure you really look at it from all angles including hers. Imagine if you were in a relationship with a girl for few years and your best friend said she loved you. It might put up a wall between you to. All I can say if I were in your shoes I would probably tell her and hopefully we can still be friends. At least then she'd know how I feel .. the only problem dude is your still gonna want her and she can't really do anything if she loves the guy she's with.. its one of those you have to be happy because she's happy and find someone else.|`|x0KszFPMaa	i think you should just wait until she breaks up with her boyfriend to tell her how you really felt about her.  then you can tell her how you feel as well as not be the reason for her break up    and if she doesn't break up with him, then find another girl to like because there is no use in waiting around for someone. know that you are worth it and can be someone's  1
7H9q5P5Paa	You can make it go away in a matter of minutes if you break up the damaged blood vessels. Take a chapstick cap or something and cup it over your hickie. Then twist it.    It hurts a little bit, but really helps.  Ice it later.
71VRvldJaa	Tell him he's smothering you and it's making you crazy and if he doesn't back off a bit you're going to have to end all contact with him because you can't take it anymore!  Yes, he will probably cry and get depressed and start seeing death, etc.  That's his way of controlling and manipulating you to keep you around.  You have to be blatantly blunt with people like this and once you tell him, stick to your guns......totally ignore all the tears and the "woe is me" garbage!  He'll keep this up as long as you let him!  I don't know how old you are or how old the boys you go to school with are but this "older" guy certainly isn't mature!  He sounds like a whiny wimp!|`|8O4ttgGMaa	he's drama. he wont go through with anything he says he will (probably) just tell his parents that you're "breaking up" and they can take care of him from there|`|dWwIEqEwaa	maybe talk to him about it? but you can never really change someone so if he doesn't stop and you really can't take the clingyness anymore you have to break up with him. Just call a counseller if your afraid hes going to commit suicide if you break up with him, because thats not right that he is manipulating you like that|`|ssbKJ6fCaa	kinda creepy...LEAVE HIM.... i think your more of just staing with him cause off fear thats not what you want living life in fear..and he is NOT MARURE he is a lil boy who needs help..and not from you so leave him k it will be better for you|`|vjxroyxjaa	Perfection comes with a price huh? Sounded lik a great guy until u hit me with the whole over emotion thing. I think it's terrible that he manipulates u and all. Is he that lonely and shallow? Plz dont take this as me tryn to pull him down im just saying. Anyway, u hav to think whether u can hav those same qualitites- cute, romantic, nice- in another guy who isnt "too" nice. I mean being too nice is one thing but then to be manipulative too is a biggie. That will lead to possibly not trusting each other which isnt good. Id say talk to him bout it. He probabley cry but u hav to make it flat and dry- either u change or u and i r gonna change. Follow ur head and heart. Do wat is best for u.  I hope this helps,  Best of Luck!  -Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.com|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Run as fast as you can away from this guy. He obviously has a personality disorder and will drag you into the pits of hell if you start going out with him. He has already attached himself to you.  I'll bet he has no other friends. You should ask other people that know him what they think of him.|`|NOYOgHIEaa	TOO CLINGY!!! find someone else|`|yfDw30Ohaa	WTF hes not mature ... wowwowowowow okay this kid has problems, in my opinion..please.. do yourself a favor and stay far away, theres alotta good guys out there i would leave this one alone|`|hjvwMgKoaa	He seems like a dramatic weirdo. I don't think that a relationship would work with him. I think that right now what you are feeling is flatter. I dont think i real man should cry like that. It sure doesnt sound mature to me for him to be crying!!!|`|CS9qmGHtaa	i go to school with someone like that and depression is a hard thing to handle...i understand why you wouldnt wanna be with someone that way but i think you should explain to him the problem...how you need someone that is going to make you happy but not someone that is going to bring you down...i know this is not mondo good advice but i am not good with typing words...sorry=[
Fi8AIi4baa	Something personal for him, yet original, or something dealing with a memory you share...  and chocolate as an added bonus would be nice. Guys tend to like chocolate.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Dress up as a nurse and take advantage of him,Always works|`|HbayB338aa	get him something he and u love|`|XqAWm9Yjaa	What is favorite things
DFJ9m4WKaa	Do not tell your boyfriend that you cheated on him. If you love him and you want him to be happy, then why would you hurt him by telling him you cheated? The only reason you would tell him is if you wanted to break up.     Ever listen to love line with Dr. Drew? In fact I used to think it was the right thing to tell the partner if you cheated. Dr. Drew explained that it not only causes unnecessary pain, but that it will change the relationship permanently. Your boyfriend will not trust you, he may even cheat on you as a means for "revenge".     So just keep it to yourself and maybe consider asking yourself if there is not a more deeper reason why you cheated on him. Maybe you have an issue with your boyfriend you are not working out. Or maybe you cheating him is telling you to deal with something else in your past. Maybe father issues or issues with guys in general.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you could start by stop cheating.|`|Okc9dlxmaa	yea if ur nt even sure u feel the same then why be with him    and if he cheated on u wouldnt u wanna know?   so yes tell him, so he can get over you and let u be bc if u just break up with him w.o tellin him u cheated he's never gonna know why , and he should know why for closure.   so yes leave him aand be single   or do w.e u want u knw bt tell him   its only fair.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	Break up with your boyfriend and date the new guy!!|`|xccRugjHaa	When in doubt, throw him out.  Seriously, if you doubt your feelings for your boyfriend that just means that it's probably time to end things.
r3LI6mKhaa	I think personality and humor dominates over appearance. I mean yeah appearance is a plus and all, it attracts one but definately if you don't have personality like it just kills it because you'd be so dull. But  a guy that like understands you, knows what to do in any situation and basically makes you feel comfortable around him is a good onee! Definelately has to be funny as well ;]|`|1nk8WPrtaa	A nice sized man piece|`|AA12108398	kindness, gentleness, we don't want to be pressured but cherished.|`|WQ3GgJCZaa	i dont know... i always seem to start liking the ONE guy i CANT have :|  so yeah... be a bit hard to get maybe... only a tiny bit.  be sweet, kind... hotness helps! :P  generous and caring.|`|f8f0487878bef325f88304a90d6e36b3aa	i'm a girls..and i never know waht i want..  it actually depends on person u want to be with..  just be ur self and nobody else...then u'll find someone who rlly likes u.  its stupid to ask what all girls loo for in all guys cuz everyone is different
x0KszFPMaa	i don't. i want to be the pretty one in the relationship. honestly, girly guys are a turn off for me. call it low self esteem, but i just don't like the thought of my guy taking more time on his hair than me =)
p6QizgmRaa	She can file all she wants, it's a dead issue until you have been a resident for 6 months. No judge will look at it until then.  And what a cold hearted b*tch to leave at such a horrible time!  Welcome to Florida!|`|dFMSACxhaa	First of all, you have to be a Resident in Florida for 6 months before you can file for a divorce. If you can prove that, then contact the civil department at the Clerks office and tell them.  This may put a hold on it for a while.|`|D4oVe5guaa	I don't how to answer your question but, I suggest you change categories and put this in the LAW & ETHICS section. Good luck, I feel for you.

GwEZ8uJnaa	just a pointer, i would never go out with a random guy. try talking to her first and showing her you are friendly before you ask her to hang out. If you dont know each other and have never talked than asking her out would just lead to an awkward time..|`|AA11644956	participate in the same activities that she does.    if she's in year book. register for year book class.    if she runs track, join track...or at least be the water-boy.          check out my fashion site:    www.styleandregalia.com|`|1s6mQJqOaa	Do a cute scavenger hunt idea, like put a note on her locker saying go outside and then lead her around a few places until the place where you are and then like hold a sign saying will you go out with me!

I am also a college student.|`|kvcIdORcaa	don't worry about them, who are they to judge. people say crap all the time and gossip just because it's entertaining for them. but don't let it worry you. you should actually feel blessed and happy that your parents support you. as long as you feel proud of where you are, what they say shouldn't matter. everyone lives their life at a different pace and in different ways. some of my friends from high school are married, some are single with a kid, some have had many kids....some have successful careers...some have worked in foreign countries...then there's me still in college. it's your life and as long as you're happy with it, that's all that matters|`|gwNHbrz0aa	No, screw those people.  Besides, changing your major 3 times is average.  No two people are the same and you certainly don't need to be criticized by bigots.  Good job for sticking with it.

0pXlz2rDaa	I'm a guy, and I would have to agree with your boyfriend.  That would piss me off, and if it was an ongoing thing the manager would be asking to get his a s s kicked|`|fQ3AKGKxaa	If he was making you cry than prob the same or tell him off but it would prob continue so he did the best thing thats why he isnt being a jerk anymore he prob feels good at work being able to boss you all around like that.|`|1vigJEJtaa	Well, I wouldn;t assault the guy.  It sucks that your boss is a jerk but that really something you need to deal with.  If I was in that situation, I would be sympathetic towards you but not get involved.|`|K8uYKj06aa	I'd of beat the crap out of him too. You're boyfriend protected you and did his job, and pretty well at that.|`|jPLiMCPDaa	There are so many ways to handle the situation.  Risking jail for battery is the more idiotic of them considering that the manager was only using words.    Physical force is only justified in the need of physical self-defense... like if the manager was pushing, pulling, or hurting you.    This boyfriend is dangerous.  You need to RUN, not walk, away from him.    I know you aren't going to listen to my advice, but trust me.  EVERY girl I have warned about this didn't listen and they ended up getting physically abused by the guy "they loved"...    And all the typical excuses "he didn't mean in", "I was in the way", "I deserved it".|`|AA11795191	I would have quit my job and found another (since restaurant jobs arent that hard to find). I would have done that before I came home crying, or at least after the first time, and I doubt my boyfriend would risk going to jail just because someone was mean to me.
QAGaQUDRaa	Have you ever heard that really cliche saying "If you love something, let it go"? Well, I think that's what you need to do. Don't lead her into thinking that you will be together forever if you know that's not what you want. It isn't fair to her if you keep her tied down in a relationship that isn't really going anywhere.    Of course, I can see why you'd want to stay together for a while, but not get married. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free, right? (See how stupid and selfish that sounds? It's how you're coming across....)|`|2oXy22pvaa	I'm sorry to say, but it is kinda wrong. Your just gonna really hurt her later. It's better to break it off now. Seriously, she'll now hope for it, she'll be thinking about it even if your not. And it's wrong to lead her to that then hurt her. Please be a decent person, and don't hurt her like that.|`|kvcIdORcaa	if you really don't want a future with her, just end it. the girl you want to marry could be waiting for you after.     this reminds me of my mom's friend... kinda a sad story. she's in her 50s now single, never married. she was with a guy for YEARS. she worked and they lived together while he got an education in college. i believe she even paid for his education. then she was planning to settle down with him of course and get married. but he wanted to move after he graduated to get some great job, and without her of course. no marriage. she was heartbroken. so they broke up and she moved on. it turns out he didn't get the job and he is mad at her for leaving him or something. now i guess he regrets it. and they're both still single    anyways just be sure you don't regret. :] and don't string her along...|`|VxhknQjEaa	Of course you should stay with her!  I personally think youa re just crazy for thinking that!

You need to get your life straight and find someone you would want to spend the rest of your life with. If it's not her then so be it, keep lookin.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	I think you're wasting your time and hers. It's not that I feel that every relationship that you have should be with someone who you could see yourself marrying, it's just that you've already told her that you planned on marrying her. So, she probably still thinks you intend to marry her someday. But now you've changed your mind. Staying with her is just giving her false hope, and in my mind that's unfair.|`|NTTvXl87aa	I would not live with her. The longer you live with her, the more she will think that you like her, and when you finally do break up, she will be very heart-broken. Also, I personally don't believe it is correct to live together and have relations with her when you are not married. But, these are just my personal views.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	it is very wrong to stay with her if you know it won't be forever.  you are wasting her time and essence lying to her.  you are robbing her of time she has to find her "the one"|`|b85b1d404ec18c8134c1bf7b53170ed2aa	if you don't want to marry her, you don't really love her in my opinion, but, talk to her and find out how she feels about it, sounds like staying together would be a total waste of time when you could be with the girl you would marry.|`|Okc9dlxmaa	if you've talked about marriage with her its in her head and she things that's probably where things are gonna go further down the line.    BT if u dont want to marry her anymore, then ur just wasting her time and yours too bc ur giving her false hopes and she's over there thinking that ya gon get married when you know ur nt so i say tell her that, let her make tht choice to either stay with u and waste more time or to leave and do her own thing and be with someone that DOES wanna marry her|`|jVx7pmCgaa	Some people come into our lives and walk with us a short time others a long time.   I was living with this really fun, exciting yet totally immature guy for about a year and i did love him and loved being around him but i knew in my heart i would never marry him, and after pretending like everything was wonderful (because id rather be with him then by myself) he proposed and it completely broke his heart when i told him i didnt want to marry him, and it haunts me how much i hurt him and how selfish i was to string him on.   I think if you know you dont want to marry her she has a right to know so she can spend her 'good looking' years finding the one she will marry and not waste time on someone who wants someone different.     Sorry but i think it would be for the best to move on for both of you.
1TKlC4YVaa	usually around 16. i think its unrealistic to wait until marriage, i mean honestly, its not 1987. i'm not saying to go and have promiscuous sex, but when you feel ready and are truly in love its not a sin to do it. it feels good too! but don't start anything until you are truly ready and you are in love|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	15 years old|`|AA11108018	Way to early in life.

And by teens I mean stupid little kids above 12 who wanna be daddy's  &  mommy's .|`|B92xHBDKaa	The usual age is like 16 or 17 and up.|`|us7YBPIOaa	probably  15 I know a girl who lost ot at 14 and one who lost it at 13
0a3ecde4cde9a9d580733f222785f56caa	You can't know that your hymen didn't break. Usually by the time you are mature enough for sex, the hymen has broken on its own due to normal physical activity.    Yes, you lost your virginity.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Your bestfriend?  LOL    You're not a virgin anymore.|`|sJJcwsJJaa	if his wiener was in you, you're not a virgin anymore|`|eKxPSMolaa	yes, and kind of sexual contact counts. but it's kind of an opinion based question...|`|ukBX5OOsaa	If he got in, even the slightest then yes.|`|2jBtScVcaa	sounds like it counts to me... but what do i know|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	do want it to count?     if so it did.     if not it didn't    technically since he passed the entrance, it's intercourse, but everyone has their own definitions, and so it's really up the the person...|`|iLTlJszaaa	Yes it counts.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Doesn't sound like it. If you still have your hymen, I would say no.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Virginity can be state of mind, if you do not feel like you lost it, well it's still there.|`|0l027sJxaa	if you saw blood then yes!|`|qK2B6Ivaaa	Well essentially, I think girls and guys define "losing their virginity" in their own ways.    Some people are going to say yes, because there was penetration, you did.  But others are going to say you didn't.    It's really all what you consider.  I personally, if I were in your situation, wouldn't consider it "losing my virginity."|`|y9z65Rndaa	that's pretty hard to say, but if it was in u i guess so.|`|o1eNW0mIaa	Welcome to the Non-Virgins club|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Ya... that was dumb honey.|`|LzyoJ36Vaa	Yes, he stuck his penis in, it counts.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	you make the decision.  your opinion is all that matters.    hope your not too young.|`|o2mAjquEaa	niiiiiiiice.|`|h6sxREeWaa	no you didnt,  sorry .  but that mayy not  be a bad thing .  thats something sooo  special . something  onlyy YUU have the power  over . virgins are kool .|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	wow what a stupid way to lose it|`|OaxXT5nzaa	It's a technicality, really.  You decide.  What does it matter if this is the person you want to lose your virginity to...|`|6opidS31aa	Technically not until your hymen is broken.|`|Sl0iE8cbaa	NO, you are still a virgin. It has to move in and out at least a couple times.|`|us7YBPIOaa	hmm that depends on your personal preference. it supposed to hurt but he didnt break it and there was no bledding so technically no..i personally dont count it.|`|67b89f175f9e6da423ea726e431c5ba0aa	what a stupid question.  why are u even asking this?  this isnt even supposed to be on here!  oh and to answer ur question,  idk!|`|6e5a57787c3f60d43faa7cb6bcd04815aa	It counts if you want it to.  Virginity is a relative question.  Some people think you don't lose it by having oral sex - that's absurd.  The true meaning of a virgin is someone who has NEVER had a sexual experience, male or female.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	if it didn't break then no, it doesn't really count.|`|0dd0cKUGaa	Do you think you lost your virginity...that is the important question. The concept and definitions of what it it to be a virgin is socially constructed. So, there is no absolute line that has to be crossed. Some people consider virginity to be lost when a person feels lust for another. No actions even have to take place. Others consider a person a virgin until the entire act is complete. Whether or not you are a virgin, is defined by your peers as well as yourself. So you just have to ask yourself: Am I still a virgin?|`|DQlZIzAFaa	99% of the time if someone isn't sure if they lost their virginity, they did.    any time you touch another person's genitalia to yours, there is a risk of STD, pregnancy, etc. you're not a virgin.     use condoms. be safe. have fun. it hurts less if you're relaxed and really turst the person. lube helps too.|`|7tibLPi2aa	Yeah if he put...yeah you lost it. That was stupid.|`|x3istER1aa	yes|`|ZG21jsQBaa	It counted, any sexual activity counts.|`|j8zj6JQPaa	same thing happened to me.. everyone says it does|`|qcGLAhzzaa	no|`|2xCjSJmgaa	Yep that will do it.  Just make sure that you are using protection next time.|`|p1OZGQkDaa	yeah it counts. any penetration is sex. whether it was 2 min. god forbid or 30 ;)  and those people that say you only lose your virginity when you hymen is broken... thats a lie. using a tampon can break it as well as being fingered or something. so does that mean the first girl that used a tampon and broke it "lost her virginity"   does that make ANY sense??|`|BUlLOqjeaa	I would say no if it didn't completely go in. And I hope you used a condom this time and the next! =)|`|xJ1ZPI44aa	yea i think so      oh yea and   y did yall try to hav sex|`|i3uK6Fk2aa	If he penetrated you then yes you lost your virginity. Penetration counts|`|DKpHPjtXaa	You are still a virgin. You stopped before he was all the way in, and your hymen is still intact, so medically you are still a virgin. You don't have to count it unless you want to.     When you think you are truly ready for sex, do a little research on how to prepare for the discomfort so it doesn't hurt so bad (like lube, and things like that...) But wait until you are really ready to take that step.|`|VGztpIDRaa	I think you should have to get climax'd on...
x0KszFPMaa	you maybe approaching them the wrong way. every time a boy tries to hit on me and makes me feel uncomfortable, i tell him i am not ready for a relationship when he tries to get my number or facebooks me more than just a friendly facebook message.     Girls are not something you should approach in bulk, pick one girl and make her feel special. let her know that to you, you think she's something else. and if she still isn't interested, move on    but if you aren't willing to put in this effort... you don't want to date.|`|n4zATZ7Paa	Ask yourself: Are you doing something wrong?
vd2ExGEraa	maybe u have 2 take it slow. that's how some girls are,  just remember to go easy w/her if shes not ready for that type of commitment yet. And if your brave enough go straight ahead and ask her! if she says no and your not sure your ready too move on (another girl)  just go at her speed.

bpm7OcbTaa	It's natural for you to feel hurt by your boyfriend looking at someone else, who you think is prettier than you.  I mean, honestly women like to believe that we are enough for our men and there is no need for their eyes to wander elsewhere.  While you are right that he is a man, he still needs to be respectful to both you and your relationship.  Talk to him about it and let him know that you don't particularly like this habit.  Either he can adjust behavior or not.  If he doesn't and it still bothers you, move on.  But if he changes, then you know that he truly wants to grow from this.      Truth be told, he is with you, so even though you think these girls are "prettier than you" because of your weight, in his eyes you may be just the girl for him.  He is with you - not them.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Well, remember that he is with you because he's attracted to you. Yeah, all guys look, but it's pretty disrespectful of him to ogle girls while he's out with you. Just tell him how you feel about it. Tell him it makes you uncomfortable. If he cares he'll make an effort to curb it.|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	It's perfectly fine to be upset. I get hurt when my guy looks at other girls. Even if it's just riding down the car, knowing that he will never see that girl ever again, it still hurts. But there's nothing really to do. You can't exactly tell your man to not look at one single girl when we go out.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	ok, so you say all guys don't do it.  well 98% of them do.    it IS human nature to look, just if it bothers you when he does it around you, you should tell him how you feel.  also if its just a quick glance. don't stress it.  if he's freakin' staring.  then def. needs a confrontation.|`|MJALNawOaa	It is fine that you are hurt by this. His actions should match his words. Yes, this is natural for guys to do, they are visual creatures after all. However, many guys choose to fight the urge to look at other girls. A great book that you may want to check out is "Every Man's Battle." It will give you the chance to understand a little bit more about how guys'  minds work. You can give it to him to read too if he seems willing to work on this. My bf and I both read it and things have been amazing for us!    Warning: This book can be upsetting to read, for you at least, because it tells the truth very bluntly. But if you read with understanding and an open mind. It could be great!|`|HmPZnO4naa	Yea dont get jelouse but some guys are just horn-dogs tell him that it bothers you and if he loves you then he will quit without question.  and your weight has nothing to do with it, jessica simpson is still hot as h*ll and she has put on a few lbs so dont think points are just given to pple that are 15lbs underweight. i personally like something to grab but thats just me.|`|s9Pb6MnYaa	you're not wrong to be hurt by this...I would be too. most girls are.  why should you be made to feel ugly and unappreciated by your own boyfriend? you should go out with a guy that actually likes you and that doesn't have a wandering eye (and you said so yourself, you know that there are guys that don't look around). guys obviously say that to their own girlfriend just to keep and to keep them satisfied (tell them that they're the most beautiful). but if he thought so, his eyes would be glued to YOU. ditch him and go for a guy worthy of your time.

I mean I'm sure that it will be awkward, but you are all adults so she should understand. That does make it worse that it was the first real meeting that you two had. But give her a chance to get to know you for more then some naked girl in her sons room and you will be fine.

I would have demonstrated thanks for my parents for their kindness, love, and sacrifices.    I would have planned out my life better - with college, what I will do after college, what I want to pursue, etc.    I wish I could have saved more money, as seen by our economic troubles these days.

And just tell your two friends to pinkie promise and i mean the PINKIE promise because i mean the PINKIE is so truthful!!

ab53f9f9b57fbad3cbd3296191c30a92aa	You started off your question with what I think is your answer..."When she went away, we split up..."  She might feel that since you aren't officially together that she isn't cheating on you.  It sounds like she does really care for you, I guess you need to talk to her about it and both decide what you want and are willing to put up with.  Maybe ask her if she assumes you're seeing other people...|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Tell her that you heard she was dating someone form school and ask her if she wants to tell you about it.  Ask if it is something serious that might cause you and her to alter the nature of your quasi-relationship, or whether she still has feelings for you.    Don't put her on the defensive--because the two of you agreed to split up, which means both of you are free to date other people... just tell her you are curious and don't want to get mixed signals from her on how she feels and you'd rather know straight up how things are with the new guy and with you.    It's normal for people to grow apart during college. Long distance relationships are very difficult, which is why the two of you broke up in the first place.  It was probably the right thing, but it's obvious you still have strong feelings for her... She may not know how to tell you about the new guy--so I think I would just ask and tell her you want her to feel she can be honest and up front with you.. Communication is key to any relationship.  But you will need to be strong enough to hear it if she tells you something you don't want to know.      I know it is a difficult situation you are in.  It's hard to be the one left behind. Good luck.|`|H21Un2fiaa	If she is cheating, which im not saying she is, but if so she doesn't deserve you. if you find out she is more than a friend with this guy leave her.|`|RsenWiWfaa	F@ck her!            I'm sorry, the wording was just so perfect...      But really, idk. I'd talk to her some more, then consider moving on. Make sure her sister isn't playing u. If u think she's dating another guy, just ask her about it.|`|jLKcuMNraa	you shouldn't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be exclusive with you.  words mean nothing if she doesn't show it.  why would her sister lie about her dating some other guy if she has nothing to gain from it? just ask her about it and if she confirms it is true then you should probably think about if you still want to be with her even though she wants to be with other guys too.
AA10604300	tell the Lord Jesus about your woes.  you need to move on.
kUxJJzzmaa	Main thing is when he comes over dont bring anything up about his ex unless he does. And what would make him happy is that either doing what he would like or you would like, its only starters but not to much to worry. With doing activites i mean by (walks or sumthing)     And when i mean about dont talk about the ex unless he does, only say word like "oh ok" dont really get into on how she acted. Main thing is he wants to forget about his ex. Other wise they wouldnt call it an ex these days.|`|0dd0cKUGaa	well if he actually admitted to having feelings for an ex that should be a red flag. But if you honestly like him and you are willing to risk investing time in him and possibly not getting anywhere, then continue spending time with him. Even if you have to give the disclaimer that you are hanging out "just as friends" still do it. But don't forget to flirt. Not heavily at first but if he isn't turned off by a little flirting then step it up some. Eventually he will have to make a decision to either pursue you or stop the flirting.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Be more flirty when you see him.  It should get his mind off of his ex.|`|cR3M6tepaa	get buttnaked cuz that wuld grab my attention|`|b2zSN7wkaa	just hang out with him there is no harm in that.|`|IK925thzaa	Flirt with him and try to get him not thinking about his ex and start making him think more about you. This can be a start of a beautiful relationship|`|258mrT2Paa	grab him while he is standing to attention, that should take his mind off last gf|`|jvvDbAl5aa	just be kind and listen to his life story  oh yea and it couldnt hurt if u made him some cookies or brownies|`|ZtP0dobmaa	go topless, thatll grab some attention|`|8UgXZ6zuaa	trust me on this.  hang out with him, be nice offer advice and let him vent if he needs it.

Hope I helped!|`|QLYBqDokaa	just go for him! dont sleep with him,just be nice to him! Dont show that you really want him
0Kavznzpaa	I'm not a guy.. but I can offer my opinion?    Maybe he just wanted to gauge your reaction, if it was some other random boy? Boys tend to do that, mess around with the girls that they like to see how they react. I've encountered it many times.    I mean, that staring thing is usually an indication of some level of interest. Maybe you can playfully ask him about it tomorrow or something. Then you'll be able to tell something from the way he responds.    hope I helped!|`|EK5uWdNCaa	I'm 99% sure he knows that you like him. Despite what people say, most guys can actually tell when someone is interested in them. He likely wanted a reaction from you so that you would make eye contact again, and maybe speak to him. It's likely that he also has a "crush" on you.    -Paul
t9rTToWYaa	It looks innocent.  My friends say that to each other all the time.  Like they see a picture of one of their friends and say:  "Awww so pretty.  love youuuu.  forever&always."  It's just joking around, but they love each other like sisters.  They're straight.    It's just a girl thing.    Some of my guy friends do it too.  It's funnier when they do it, but you know they're kidding around.|`|I0JBGllLaa	just ask her, geez.|`|k3HG24v2aa	looks like you got some detective work to do!!!|`|C3tVKFWuaa	I knwo that i am NOT lesbian and my friends say taht we are going tu with eachother. It's just for fun. Maybe all you ahve to do is ask her, and see waht she says. Good Luck!|`|rqpuwWWaaa	well just ske her is she?|`|594rneLRaa	Yes!
joA5Rcyzaa	laugh it off    seriously, become the joker    it pisses off whoever made you angry too|`|3kNeWYvdaa	For some people it makes their anger worse but when I'm angry I put on my head phones and blast some music that describes how you feel. It calms me down for some reason...no music around? well, I tend to take deep breathes and think about people who make me laugh. For me it really does put a smile on my face when I look back at all those times they'd practically give me an asthma attack from laughing so hard!|`|LVcgfszBaa	Maybe some counseling would be a good idea!|`|8m0OWTO8aa	Think about what you say before you say...|`|z6qIZRFFaa	I dont|`|OwfoyXpraa	Everyone has their own ways to control there anger, you just have to find what works best for you. :)  I, personally, will start drawing or sketching if I'm really angry, or I'll lock myself in my room for awhile and listen to music until I've cooled off.  Other suggestions would be yoga, sports, talking to someone..  just find something you enjoy to do, something that relaxes you. (:|`|71LeWL4waa	dunno puch a wall|`|Mo6ddqx2aa	Let it go and let God...|`|KFWVWwb3aa	i have the same problem and cant control my anger i need someone to teach me!|`|258mrT2Paa	try doing a 2 piece jigsaw without a picture.|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	I just ignore everyone and everything, and go be by myself.|`|jsMJ4d8jaa	Maybe attend some anger management classes, or maybe get some counseling I think would be a good idea! =] People have there own ways of controlling their anger but some handle their anger in good ways and other in not so good ways. Like me I have an anger problem and what I used to do was cut myself to take out that anger, or punch walls, or scream at someone, or just beat the living hell out of somebody. I tried anger management classes and that crap just pissed me off more it didn't help because I didn't want it to. It just depends on what type of person you are, how far you are willing to go to control your anger, and how badly you really want to control your anger in a good way. Now to control my anger I just cry my eyes out until I go to sleep, or just write in a journal how I'm feeling and that usually helps wonderfully! =]|`|03GQ637Raa	Try counting to ten taking deep long breathes.  Walk away, take a walk.  Try writing what your angry about instead of exploding.  Please check source below for helpful link.
TTP90Ug1aa	Tell the sensitive guy that he is being too sensitive. Don't play around with it like "you are thinking too much" or "don't think/say that". Just tell him straight forward. "(Enter name), you too sensitive and over dramatic about things. Please fix it because it drives me crazy." Again, just tell him straight forward. Don't mix up the words so he doesn't feel like he is doing a puzzle. Remember guy language.   The other guy sounds like a wife beater. Muscles and anger don't mix together good when he is your husband.  I know it sounds kind of early or weird to say that but that is why people date, right? He might say to you that he would not hurt you. Don't believe him 100% because the wife beaters said the same thing too.
869bb7a223baecd52d10fd82a9beab0caa	Try talking to him about it. If he loves you he would talk to you and care about what you have to say. If he still acts the same way, I would break up with him. Good Luck =]|`|AMDs8X0Raa	I don't know how old your are of it you're sexually active, but one of the first signs is showing a non interest in sex.  If you haven't reached that stage then he wouldn't not be interested in being intimate with you. Or any other bonding type of activity where you just spend time together.  Disengaging for those activities means he is mentally preparing himself to move on.|`|jLKcuMNraa	if you have been going out for a little over a year, chances are he's just freaking out because you have been with each other for that length of time.  same thing happened with me and my boyfriend. he got kinda distant around the year mark but its because he was never with someone for that long before. now its been two years and everything is perfect.  maybe the same thing is happening for you.  if it is then trust me it will pass. guys tend to get freaked out by long term commitments.
5f86f6552e6112c3c20b372afbfadb64aa	Well make sure that is what you want to do.     Because sometimes when we break up we only remember the good things. My girlfriends were a great help here.. reminding me what I didnt like about it.    I have gotten back together with my husband after we broke up for a while.. and we made two contracts.. one he wishes would happen and one I wished would happen .and then we sat down and talked it out and created one contract that showed we were both given and taking alittle.     It worked for about another 7 years.. until drugs got in the picture.. So, it can be done.. but make sure you are honest with yourself first.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Why is he an ex?|`|vCTMZKrgaa	There are pros and cons to getting back with exes. Did this guy hurt you? Because if he did maybe it's not such a good idea, you don't know if he'll do it again. You seem like you might be clingly and he might be able to see that and use it against you. Move on, find another man who is better then the ones before.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	first, u need to really think do u truly want this person back in ur life. do u think about them constantly from time to time, do u regret breaking up with them, and mostly will the same thing happen again if u go back out with them?  then u might as well call them up and see how theyre doin, like a friend. and ask them if theyve missed u at all. and be honest with them if u were missin them, let them kno.|`|awbCfN7Iaa	just be who you are. if someone can not except that then move on. we should never have to perform or manipulate a relationship. let love be authentic love not manipulated love|`|ghItgMZxaa	well i would have to say don't bother.  its ok to think about someone from time to time but i wouldn't say things will work.  set down and think the reasons why you broke up. maybe its for the best that you broke up. i know i just got out of a bad relationship and i do love her still, but not in any way that i will ever want to be with her again.  so just think of the pros and cons and make your mind up on what you want from life!!!!|`|c7b1bc7eeb9eaca75e8314dff2f19101aa	I haven't been in this situation before but all i can say is be very careful. think about the reason why y'all seperated in the first place and see if those issues can be resolved. Give it some time and see what happens. If you and your ex really care about each other and are willing to work things out, i say give it another go.. Goodluck
FVDTXM68aa	Wow...sounds like either (a) a really lame excuse to break up, or (b) the craziness is for real! Honestly, if he truly loves you, he will work things out. And if he is feeling pressured by his mom/grandma, then maybe he just needs time to sort things out. I mean, you guys dated for 2 years, so he definitely still has feelings for you; you can't just turn them off like a light switch! I say, don't call/text him for a while. Give him some space, and when he is ready to talk, he will call you. Honestly, I don't think this is the last you will hear from him! :) And it's not that bad that he is still living at home (that is, if he has a job and is saving his $). I know it's going to be hard, but just leave him alone for a while; let him pursue you! I'm sorry this happened right before Valentine's day.....Keep your head high, and never lose faith!! If it's truly love, and if you guys are meant to be together, it will happen! Good Luck, hun!! :)|`|sibFhZyWaa	He`s 26 and can`t go out with you because his mommy don`t like you???

If the guy is 26 and still living with his parents who are actually still making decisions for him, he needs to be a big boy and get out into the world on his own and make his own decisions.  If his mom made decisions for him before, then perhaps it was her doing that he didn't call you. Nonetheless, he is a free adult who can make his own decisions.  If he really cares and wants to be together with you he would probably make the effort if he has before in the 2 years you dated. If not, I would try and contact him one last time and give him an ultimatum so that both he and you know the situation. If he still doesn't contact you, I would try and forget about the guy and move on.|`|fbXYElEOaa	forget about the world and everyone in it, if you love the guy do whatever your heart tells you to do, just make sure your brain isn't asleep during this instruction period. Love is like a roller coaster, there will be twists and turns and ups and downs, but whatever happens the ride is always exciting. Good luck and I hope you get what you want.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Let me get this straight....The guy is 26 and still lives at home and lets his mommy tell him what to do and who to date ????? WTF ??? Are you nuts ??? Why would you date a loser like that ?|`|3secB3Smaa	Unless he grows up and gets an apartment,you need to move on.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	He's ready to end it sweetie and you need to accept it regardless whether his reasons are true or not. He's 26, so him not being able to see you until he moves out is ridiculous. I don't believe he'll call & the sooner you accept this and move on, the happier you'll be. Take pride in yourself and look for a worthy partner. Good luck!|`|aQvQReJBaa	Sounds like he fed you a story of BS because he isn't the confrontational type. He doesn't want to make himself "sound" like a bad person by saying something that wouldn't put him in an awkward spotlight so he uses a story you can't exactly argue or put him on the spot over which in turn makes him "look" bad...and from the sounds of it, is noticing how bad he looks.    So to answer your question, it sounds like a not-so-well planned out lame excuse to break-up with you.    p.s 26 and still lives with his parents? damn
wf3S2avqaa	Man this is a hard question to answer. Just contine to be yourself man. Maybe speak up a little bit more and don't be so shy. What i do know you SHOULDNT do is take "HELP"advice. SAY NO TO DRUGS, and don't buy anyone ****. If you take drugs you will ruin your life. If you buy them things they are going to start using you and taking you for granted. Been there done that.|`|653j6x9maa	u gotta have things in common with them, or at least the most popular one. or give them alcohol or drungs or buy them things.

If you kinda like him you should say so, like: "Hey dude know what, I kinda like you.? Do you kinda like me too?       Guys like to hear that a girl likes them,  it goes to their head and they start thinking they're Gods gift to women.      Your boyfriend is no different, go for it...and have fun!    Good Luck    God Bless|`|Oc2pseQAaa	does he flirt with you more than other girls, do you see him check you out from the corner of his eye, does he call regularly?|`|UwhyTsCKaa	Don't be so direct, ask something like " Are you interested in anyone?"  That will not only show him that you are interested in what he thinks, but it will to an extent hint that you are interested in HIM.|`|X9RBRqL2aa	dont ask him just et it roll and he will make a move if he likes you. if you wanna speed it up though try lightly flirting to make him confident that you like him|`|TQHHH7kxaa	they never leave u alone they phone u n ask wat u r doing or do u want to do somethinglike want to go out for dinner|`|nyJNM1NLaa	I know it is hard to just come out and ask especially since you don't want to ruin the friendship, but I am telling you from experience that the best and most accurate way to find out is to ask..
R3dk8fC1aa	flirting is mostly a body language thing.    i suppose the closest you could get with txt messages are things like making reference to either his or your physical features. say things that make him realize that you are paying attention to his physical appearance. make references to yours. im talking G rated, like eye collor, skin tone, clothing style, smile, collogne. just say things that allow him to think your aware of these things. dont mention things with sexual conotations, no shower references, no mention of boobs, muscles, butts etc..... thats too easy, and he will probably be turned off by it. (at least in the begining, obviously shower and penis references have to come out sooner or later)|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	send him messages like *kisses* *hugs*|`|WFRooU7Maa	Talk to him about something he likes  and give good body language, like leaning on him|`|mMXvbANyaa	find out what he likes so you can talk about it with him?|`|HbVgm7kPaa	put like lots of smilies and such after things you say to him|`|50fc8503a82ad4a3d7a2568f22b34236aa	I always just put smiley faces and have a conversation about something y'all have in common. I never really liked putting things that said anything like "Kisses" or "Hugs"...but that's just because I really don't see a guy honestly liking that.

7g8UHUJgaa	she sounds like a friend i had in high school. her style was emo and she was cool, but wierd too.    when she wore black she was happy and when she had colors on she was mad.    i found out she is bipolar and there is alot of stuff going on in her life personally.    personal things result to someone's personality so maybe your friend is like my friend.    my friend was really cool but her friends were emo too (not me, but i admire thier style) so she does not have many friends.    yes, being her friend lets her know that no matter how twisted her life is and she is, you still want to be her friend if you do.    if you care, ask what her deal is. tell her she can trust you.    my friend told me all her secrets, including liking my best guy friend...who i like too.    anyways, be a reliable friend.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It seems that she's bipolar.|`|96RDuDofaa	It sounds like she's bipolar.

And it's not rape if he's over the age of 21yrs. If he's an adult and your not, then it's rape.

kA1mYSOtaa	Josh, this girl is doing what many immature girls do: she's playing with your head. The important thing to do is to NOT let her know that what she does is bothering you. In fact, I would say to pull away from her (since most guys in your situation would only pour it on more and drive her away as a result). Do what NO other guy would do. This will make her wonder. She will probably start to pay more attention to you. Still, if she does, do NOT respond to it. She is clearly not worth it, and she will continue to do things like this just to get a reaction. She obviously craves attention, and that indicates that either she is immature and not ready for a relationship or that there is something wrong "upstairs" if you get my drift. Either way, it is not good. It is not healthy, and you should avoid her at all costs. You need a woman with integrity. One that respects you to the point at which you can go on vacation in another part of the country, come back, and nothing has happened. If you cannot trust her to that level, get out of it before she REALLY makes a fool out of you. The choice is yours.|`|tHHHN9RFaa	Sorry man then she really doesnt like you. I mean just let it go. its obvious that she doesnt want to be with you. I dont mean to put you on the down side but you can probably do better. Always stay positive.|`|KzkErmaaaa	shes a hoe. forget her|`|WsFD3EQIaa	i think its pretty bad...and shes probably justa tramp..and shes not worth it if she treats you like that.|`|E8hYgxN1aa	that would be called--->trying to make you jealous.  she wants you to want her.  that's why she flirts right in front of you.|`|xTwWM6UFaa	um yeah, thats bad.  sorry dude but this girl sounds like a player, she seems to be hitting on you, stuck on her old boy, and playing the field at the same time.  either that or shes trying to make you jealous....|`|FjUZjnSlaa	she wants your attention. She likes you and is trying to get you jealous. She wants to see how much you like her and see what you do knowing the fact that this guy is her Ex. You have 2 options. You can either just ignore it and find someone else, have her coming to you.... or you can chase her.
MKNdR4FPaa	Just delete the text and don't reply or answer if he calls dw he can't find you :)
iH4kN8ltaa	My guess is that she's just a little nervous, either that or she needs something to stare at. Or she likes you. It's hard to tell, you didn't say if she was pretty or not or self-confident or not.|`|2DVr4C5Baa	i think she prob. likes you! you should go talk to her!|`|tC4cESaCaa	i thnk she likes u....n wanna do frenship with u...as u said she is new i think she want to make good frenz ...n choose u may be ...    talk to her about where she is from n wat make her bring here etc....if she again stares u....start with a HI!..|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think she likes you.|`|B7VM3wXHaa	that's happened to me too there was a new student in my class and he kept staring at me too and we eventually started going out.So yeah i think she likes u.
Qbczt3ivaa	lol maybe you are a "sissy"....does she mean it in a bad tone? or do you REALLY act like a girl?      It sounds like she is teasing you though....|`|WZ6YXDODaa	Enjoy it, I wish some girl would have fun with me like that. LUCKY!|`|1uRUaSblaa	If you are not a sissy, why bother about the comment?  She can say what she wants and you   can choose not to prove her right.|`|jPLiMCPDaa	It really depends on how she's saying it and when.|`|a37815c4ed823b316a598c8075b66057aa	well, one, when faced with another of the opposite gender question his manhood, must ask this same question to himself. Regardless of what that girl says, she can't make or not make you a sissy boy. In fact, it is only you and your actions that can decide whether or not you are, in fact, a sissy boy.     What I mean to say is this. It could very well be that you are not a sissy boy, but this girl believes you are as she has an improper definition of sissy boy by she identifies you. If this is the case, you must pull webster's dictionary on her and prove, with webster's backing, that you are truly not a sissy boy.     However, it is also possible (and more probable) that the girl correctly identified you as a sissy boy. If this is the case, then it is not ideal to continue one's current standards of behavior. Instead, one must prove one's manhood by doing something not sissy, such as shaving, or eating a snickers bar.    Hope this helps!|`|u0ipviQsaa	Why are you allowing her to call you sissy boy?  If she says it every now and then in a joking way that's an inside joke or something, it's likely harmless jokes, but if you don't even know if she's teasing or serious, you need to tell her to cut that out...........unless, of course, you're a sissy boy

I think her parents are being a little harsh. She should talk to them. They are her parents after all.    IMO there is nothing wrong with kissing. Maybe she can talk them into letting you come over for supervised dates. She should explain to her parents that being with you makes her happy.|`|cwyMulZOaa	If you can't give her something big like flowers just slip her a note somewhere that says," I love you" or something. That really helps me feel better when my bf does that.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Write her written letters or by computer or send her a card. You are not respecting the parents wishes because you are secretly dating. She seems she is depressed and getting her mind off problems helps.|`|o7nAvIjSaa	You guys need to meet up some how. Go on a group date, and then she can tell her parents that she is just meeting up with some Friends. This sounds like a really hard situation, and im sorry that you have to deal with it. If you guys get the chance to meet, take some time to yourselves. Let her cry on your shoulder, and just tell her to let it all out. Whenever im all caught up with stress and i can't take it, my boyfriend will just let me sit with him so i can cry on his shoulder. It makes me feel like nothing else in the world is going wrong, and that time is frozen on just us. trust me, it will make her feel so much better. And of course, ask if you can do anything at all to help her out. And its always worth a shot to talk to her parents if you really care about this girl.     Good luck, i hope this helped:)|`|5MxKdoixaa	Just listen to her. Guys have a tendency to try to fix things. Unless she asks for help, don't give advice. Just listen to her problems, nod, agree with her ("I'm sorry hunny... that is tough.... I wish I could help you"). Give her support. DO NOT ADVISE, just let her have a sounding board to have a vent about her problems.|`|ieOJI6fhaa	DUMP HER|`|nBXIGU8Zaa	Tell her you love her.

You mentioned shes having family issues, the whole family is probably stressed and the last thing she needs is to start battling her parents. Your age would probably impact my answer on this though.     Do you have emails or cell texting? The best thing you can do for someone going through a tough time is to just be there if they need someone to talk to. Sometimes she'll want to talk, others she'll want someone else to talk about anything but her issues. Just be there for her.   Good luck!|`|AA10936860	let her know you're there whenever she needs you. Don't push her into talking about a fresh conflict. Just take her side and reassure her of her worth by hurtin with her.

yz6qXwUiaa	You don't say how old your girlfriend is or how old you are.  If she is under 18 then I think you should leave her alone.  Her parents wishes should be respected.  If she is old enough to legally be on her own, then that might be another matter.  If she is wise however she will still value and respect her parents.    Believe me when it comes to Jehvoah's Wtinesses religion is always a BIG factor in everything we do.  Whether your girlfriend takes her religion seriously or not I don't know, but if she does and if it matters to her, not just to her parents then she should break off with you.  Why? because she will be happier if she does.  There is a reason why the Bible tells us to "not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers".    In Bible times it was actually illegal to yoke two different kinds of animals together, such as an ox and a donkey.  Trying to make them work together was hard on both animals since oxen have greater strength, but less speed than a donkey does.  Putting them together to pull a load was unkind to both animals because they had different goals and ways of reaching them.  So the Bible uses this same terminology to apply to any relationship attempted between a believer and an unbeliever.  You will pull differently and in different directions and at different speeds and with different strengths at all the major issues of life and it will be a hardship on both of you.    This is (of course) assuming that her religion matters to HER.    If she is very young, YOU may be all that matters to her now and she may not yet realize what difficulties will arise.  But trust me they will.  (Been there done that).    Her family aren't just trying to put a wedge between you because they don't like you or whatever, they are seeking what they sincerely believe to be in her best interest because they love her genuinely and they know what sort of hardships she will face if she continues in the path she is in currently.    When you ask what are you suppose to do? Let her go.  Or conversely you could convert.  This last I do NOT advocate unless you are completely genuine and sincere about your reasons for doing so.  DON'T just do it for the girl.  That is the last thing she needs.  But you could look into what she believes and if it starts to make sense to you, if it seems more true than what you have believed formerly if it begins to matter to you, then that might be the solution.  Please don't attempt the opposite, pulling her away from her God.|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	It sounds like you two have already given up because you said "we know that this relationship may not work." So why don't you two just throw in the towel? Your gf can honestly tell her parents it's over you two are just friends. You both can see each other occassionally and let it be that.     If you don't want to give up, you both have to be prepared to lose some relationships (with family) in your life. It all comes down to if it's worth it to you both.
qe0RNp7xaa	Financial problems and how parenting (if you have kids). Financial problems - don't hide debt, nip in the butt and be honest about your finances to your partner. Parenting - is one parent too soft or too strict.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	There are so many reasons for divorce these days. From reading the questions here, I would say the number one reason is adultery. The second is often just not liking the person anymore, or "its not working" reason.   Yes. I truly believe that the right marital councelor/therapist can do wonders for a marriage. It often takes a neutral party to show the couple their mistakes and what they need to change. Those who divorce because its just not working, without trying therapy are really missing out and hurting themselves.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Money  Cheating      Stop getting married and then their wont' be divorces!|`|5k7BexD3aa	I would say either $$ or cheating.

Different parenting styles...all of it comes back to communication.      Talking, taking time for each other, realizing what you have and having the appreciation for what you do have.      I wish I could have known all this before my marriage ended.  It sucks.|`|s6HO32hIaa	Financial issues, lack of communication, lack of trust, lack of effort into maintaining your relationship.    People think that relationships just happen and that they don't require work, but they definitely do. It's like anything else that you want to be good at in life... you need to take the time to work on it.
3YfYWpAsaa	Yeah, if he tried to hug you he definitely does.  He also would definitely pick you over your "big fat friend"- thats the nickname for a girl who's a c*ckblocker for both you and the guy, cuz she can't get a guy for some reason.    My suggestion to you is to stand up for yourself and get this guy, whether it will bother your friend or not.  In reality, if he doesn't want her, she has no say in that; and she has NO RIGHT to stand between 2 people who like each other.    However, you OBVIOUSLY don't want to ruin your friendship, so before you straight up tell her "im sorry babe, but i like this guy and he likes me, so im gonna go out with him... you cant expect me to shortchange my life cuz of you", you should tell her this plan:  ================  This is a plan to anonymously find out which of you he likes more.  Have a friend come over to your house with you, and message the guy on facebook, myspace, or AIM in front of you (whichever he uses). Make sure you have him for those in advance.     Then, have your friend (in front of both of you) ask which girl (you or your friend) he thinks is cuter, and which he likes more, and which he would rather go out with if he could.  have the friend just weave it off-handedly into the convo.    TELL YOUR FRIEND THIS PLAN IN ADVANCE, AND EXPLAIN TO HER THAT WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU HE CHOOSES.... THAT IS THE ONE WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO GO OUT WITH HIM AND ASK HIM OUT!    If he says you (which I know he will), then you simply tell ur friend "sorry but true love cant be stopped", and go out with the dude. your friend HAS to forgive you- she has no reason not to!  this plan was perfect, fair, and reasonable.|`|96RDuDofaa	Yeah I guess....you should give more information, its hard 2 answer by you only telling us that he stares @ u sometimes|`|Giw99J04aa	no, you should not affect their friendship because of a boy.

You need to love yourself, before you can love someone else, otherwise you just depend on their judgment, not your own. Only you know how you feel, no-one else. So, you are the only one who deep down knows what you need to do to make things better, and cutting yourself isn't it. You know how you feel, But others don't understand why you turn to cutting. So they get frustrated, and act out in their own way, which sometimes is name calling, or hitting, or walking away. Eveyone has their own way of dealing with stress, some are healthy, some are not. Eventually you will realize that cutting will never make things better. Understanding yourself and others will. People love you, do you love yourself?|`|O1WxKk7uaa	Tell him your sorry and you know he cares but your going through alot when you shouldve tried to talk about your problems with him.|`|258mrT2Paa	KY you have to sort yourself out before you worry about him, this cutting stuff, what happens when you hit a vein ? you bleed to death. then you will have nothing to worry about ! u  say "friendly" with a lot of guys u have to start respecting yourself first and go on from there. good luck.|`|aLq8tT6Qaa	your ******** stupid, why the ***** would you cut your rist?!!?!?! if you wana kill yourself like hangyourself or slit your throut or shoot yourself dont cut your self on the rist thats the stupidest sh it ive heard of! how bout you grow a backbone and stop being such a pus sy about life! everybody has their times and most get through it. you can enjoy the rest of life like the rest of us but dont ruin it for us, pathic people like you, that wine about your life!

Whatever you are going through is important and cutting is sad. Find new friends and a counselor. Join a group at school or play sports. Do something to get your mind off him and make yourself happy and healthy and HE will come back all on his own! If he doesn't, well you just got a whole lot happier and have new friends, so chances are that you will meet another guy. But don't make anymore scars that you have to explain to him. OK? Trust me, you are still young, and life only gets harder, so learn how to love yourself while you are young. It only gets harder to learn. And it's true that no one will love you if you don't love yourself. I'm 26 and learning this the hard way. Find a way to learn to be happy while you are still young.|`|2e2ab08fee1b7fc9f1b2e5fc001d1de2aa	Just tell him you made a mistake, and your sorry for not only hurting yourself but hurting him.

Stay up there baby!|`|o2LC0yXKaa	First off, don't cut yourself. If you live long enough you'll realize how big of a mistake you could have made.     2nd, mature a little bit more. im not saying that to offend you it's just that mature girls tend not to be sluts.

Right now, his bestfriend's girlfriend is cheating on him, and I think that makes my boyfriend alittle bit uneasy. But we always talk about it to keep things in check and reassure each other. With my friends, I've been pulling away a bit. I've realized that they really aren't as good as friends as I thought they were, and I had found out that a few of them were backstabbing me, so I'm just withdrawing right now. How about you?

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	From a guy.    That is the current way to turn you on.    There are other ways    Younger lovers are often more interested in the ..number of strokes or sex acts that can be performed.    As I've gotten older - I've become better at searching for different "hot spots" on my lover and turning those spots on.  And she has repaid the favor.    My current lover was married 8 years (had 2 kids) and then divorced for 8 years.  Then I came along.  She says I'm bigger than her ex-husband.  But also I have spent time touching various parts/places of her body - where she has told me no one has ever touched before.  I've found several places/moves that just blow her mind.  We have been married now for over 22 years.  And touching the right places, is like turning on a light switch.|`|DErBSfZgaa	uhmm maybe your just not use to the other guy.|`|GxbXseoqaa	its going to be hard to settle for anything less than what your ex had cause thats apparently the pleasure you are seeking for. your not the only one to feel this way, i most deffintaley have before too.

wlvKveAXaa	flirt wth her and this is 4 u 2 find out
zGhDt3dpaa	You should break-up. There is NO reason to keep it up. In fact, you are being more fair to your boyfriend by breaking up. Because you are living a lie with him. I have been in this exact situation. The love of my life did not want me anymore either. It was a terrible feeling. I could not eat or sleep; i was depressed and angry for months. And we were best friends too. But breaking up with her was better than staying with her while she did not want me. That made me feel even worse. Because, not only did she not love me anymore, but OUT OF PITY stayed with me. That destroyed me. There will be pain either way :( But for the long run, it is best to just end it.|`|qeUoAW6naa	The grass is always greener on the other side, isn't it? But trust me, even though you think the other guy may be perfect for u, nobody is. The imperfections come into focus a bit later. Would you sacrifice your best friend and current love (with whom you share a strong bond of a year) over someone you met recently? How would you feel if your bf did the same to you? Think about it.

Try working on your relationship before you give up on it. It takes 2 to argue..so just ignore him when he starts little fights. Tell him"we'll talk when you calm down" and walk away. Trust me, it works. Don't start fights about things you know are insignificant. Also, arguing never gets anything accomplished. If you still feel you want out of the relationship, you need to get the strength and courage to leave. Of course you're comfortable with him and used to him after 7 years but this is not reason enough to stay if you're not happy.|`|o0MokIYYaa	If you have just broken up with him then you don't need to jump back into the dating scene just yet b/c every man will remind u of your ex.

20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Mention it to him. See what he says.  Some people change there password once in a awhile for security reasons.  M|`|XTBlOf9baa	Well, obviously, he has something on his computer he doesn't want you to see. To be frank, you don't hide something, unless there's something to be hidden. It could be porn, it could be compromising pictures, it could be evidence he's cheating. But it's definitely something he doesn't want you to have access to.    I just wanted to add, I don't think this is a privacy issue at all. 13 months together, and *suddenly* he needs more privacy. Whether dating or married, when your significant other suddenly needs more privacy, it's a bad sign. That's when it becomes clear that there's something he wants to hide, doesn't want you to know, etc. If this were just a matter of privacy, it wouldn't be happening now after 13 months, and he would have done something less extreme, like ask you not to be on his computer as much or something along those lines.|`|f8372c942b97ecd619d9fe6d98b610abaa	Everyone needs privacy and we all need to respect boundaries.  Respect his need to have privacy.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It's way paranoid and abnormal isn't it?  You're not a kid or an unauthorized user...nothing good about it.  I'd say advice-wise you should ask him about it a couple times then if he doesn't authorize you things are strange.  Look out with everything around you and maybe break it off, something doesn't sound right does it?|`|nC6qEW1Paa	Usually that's a sign of something, either he just doesn't want you on his comp or doesn't want you seeing what on his comp. Could be he's testing you to see how you react, if you just don't trust him. If it's never been an issue and now all of a sudden he's big on privacy something's definitely fishy. You need to talk to him and explain that it's not that you want to check up on him, it's that you feel pushed away out of the blue with no reason. At some point in a relationship there should be no hidden areas of either's life, a little privacy yes but not blatantly hiding something. There should be no reason for you to not be able to just use the comp to get on the internet, if you were wanting his pw's for his mail and internet accounts then yea, it might be a little invasive, but just using the comp shouldn't be an issue. Don't take it too serious, but don't take it too lightly. A sudden change in behavior and want/need for privacy is a little suspicous, you need to get it resolved before it starts creating resentment between you.|`|CLvUYnRRaa	go with how you feel, but be ready for any consequences that comes with it. I was always told don't ask questions if you not ready for the answers. So be sure if your relationship is worth it, if it even matters, and the change in your relationship.|`|2AZim0rUaa	I would wonder why, but I am not a very trusting person, if he changed it I think he is trying to hide something or someone from you.|`|WtNW8HcPaa	I think that would make anyone a little bit suspicious of the situation. For a whole year you have known what his password is and are able to access his computer - now all of a sudden he has a problem with you knowing what the password is and you cannot get on his computer.   I think you have every right to be paranoid. Definitely sit down and talk with him. Explain to him that you don't understand why it was okay for you to use his computer/password for a whole year, but now all of a sudden it's forbidden. Anyone should be able to understand why this behavior is suspicious.

Than you?|`|Ma0f4AfQaa	I think he is being friendly and you are sitting infront therefore, whenever he corrects the quizzes, you are the first person and whenever he gives the quizzes back, you are obviously the first. So, don't make it a big deal!|`|q9mFfx0Raa	uhmm he likes you. he really likes you and you smiling is no help thats just showing that you're flirting back and you're legal so obviously he's gonna go for you...|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well he could like you, there have been students who have their professors in a relationship. I had a spanish teacher who had a professor (not hers, a professor at the school) because she said they could lose their job if they go out with their students, so its like he's playing it safe. I  also had another science teacher (well she wasn't my science teacher, she was my study hall teacher whose class we sat in) and she had met her husband when she went to college and he was her professor which is different from my Spanish teachers situation because he wasn't her teacher. He may like you, just be normal and see how it goes, if you like him back then you should wait to see what the future has in store, if not then don't worry about it act as you were always acting.|`|zvqaicaHaa	Depends on your relationship with him. If you confined in him like talk to him after or before class then MAYBE, MAYBE Not but if you don't talk to him at all and you keep it professional then yes and I would ask him to stop first and then if its keeps going or gets worse then report it.     PS. If it bothers you tell him that it does in a professional way.
20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Do you believe him. when he tells you how he feels about you ?  How often does he need to call you to make you feel like he cares ?  Do you call him ?   No, I do not think you need to base his feelings based on how many times he calls you, when you are not together.  M|`|rywgn8HLaa	I don't think it is something that should really concern you at this point in your relationship. If he isn't messaging or calling you then it might be because he doesn't want to come off as being desperate or to clingy.   If this is something that is really troubling you then maybe you should talk with him about it...or maybe he is waiting for you to pick up the phone and call him.   Both of you are at a place where you are putting your hearts on the line - he probably doesn't want to appear to desperate or make himself to vulnerable. But talk with him about it - it's best to get things out in the open and clear things up. It sounds like he really likes you...|`|dRj9FoHzaa	It has only been 3 months, so I do not his behavior is totally unusual.  Wait a little longer and see.|`|YHcyuka3aa	Yes you should be concerned. I am thinking there could be a wife some where. Better do some detective work on your own before going any further.|`|b5UV15gCaa	He could be busy ... or in the CIA. :)  I wouldn't worry to much. good luck|`|f8372c942b97ecd619d9fe6d98b610abaa	Do you have a needy or suspicious personality?    What does your "gut" feeling tell you?    Are you much younger than him?    Does he actually date you?  Does he take you places?  Will he be seen in public with you?  If he is only sleeping with you....then I'd say you are wasting your time.|`|qpkNrn8iaa	i hate to say it but you better make sure hes not dating someone else because every guy i have dated called me everyday .|`|slJWqCI5aa	No, don't read too much into this it has only been three months. Just go with the flow and if it is meant to be, it will be!|`|BJuwGkUJaa	Sounds fine he is just giving you space and sounds like he isn't jealous.  But found out about his child hood and make sure he hasn't gotten some crap stuffed under the rug. I dated a guy like that and come to find out a year down the road he had another girl he did this for a year before he was caught. He was gonna try and marry us both.  crazy yes but he had days that i didn't see or talk to him and I lived in the same house with him  cb|`|fE5bC83Saa	is he is from the middle east?   i have answered your previous question also and i guess this guy might be good ,but have some strange things,maybe he don't date so much and don't know how it should be,its good and bad at same time.don't be allover him and let him do the right step without pushing him|`|6KVGwdBQaa	Well, it depends.  What kind of job does he have.  If he works 12 hours and then sleeps 8, it's not unusual that he's not calling you.  But if that's not the case, I would be concerned.  Do you think he's sincere when he says all these charming things to you, or does he sound like a player.  Like he's said it a hundred times and is well rehearsed.  I think you know the answer yourself, just maybe a little doubtful.  I don't mean to sound corney, but listen to what your heart is telling you.  Obviously, you have a problem with it because you're asking the question.  Surprise him one day and see what he's doing, or possible call him at work if that's ok and see if he is really there.  Just be causious either way.  If he's not doing anything wrong and finds out you're snooping, he may get mad, but if he is doing something wrong, don't get caught spying on him before you have all your info.

I bet he will!|`|FGvbJavjaa	16 is ok if uve never been kissed before dont panic, there are more older girls out there who havent even had a bf o ever been kissed which is not something you should start running around with your head cut off, be the honest person you are inside and talk to him if your scared tell him over messenger, you might have not stuffed it all up if he's nice as you say he is, then he should know that as all girls we do get scared and tend to be shy with the guy we like, he should understand, but if your worried that he might have said that to be true about he will hate you, write him an email but let what you say come from the heart, tell him the truth because at the end of the day your not loosing anything if it comes from the heart and you know that you didnt do anything wrong you just freaked out which is NORMAL and he should understand not hate you, if likes you im pretty sure he didnt mean what he said.|`|dlwIp7bGaa	@Bubblzzz: You are a mean terrible person.

NUWdgQuraa	Yes, it is.  Throw a compliment his way every so often if you like him back.  For example, tell him he's very sweet.  In relationships, it's the guys role to do the asking and the woman's role to get him comfortable to do the asking.  When it's a good match, it's a very easy process.

I think what women want in men really depends on their age.  For example a teenager tends to want a bad boy rebel, who breaks all the rules, is extremeley good looking and what not. Or an extremeley good looking jock, etc. etc.  But then as we age our senses begin to catch up with us and we realize that bad boys=bad bad bad. I find that at a certain age, women realize that kindness,intelligence and what not are really important. Because really who wants to marry a man who is disrespuctful, lieing, insensitive and horrible?  Don't worry I'm sure that there is a woman out there for you somewhere =) Just find the one that appreciates how you appreciate her!|`|rEafx4QTaa	a woman wants a guy that is confident, charismatic, and a good guy that has somewhat of a bad side.

I met someone who I didn't even give a second look, in the beginning, but now I have a huge crush. Because I got to know the guy. In otherwords maybe you are the type of guy that needs to become friends first.

Whether a guy is warm or cold, kind or cruel, giving or stingy... is not the point.      As long as he decides to be who he is and stick to it.

After that you can decide what kind of woman you want.|`|jlm0toChaa	someone who will let you sleep in their t-shirt. who sees the beauty in you no matter how you look at the time (hair messy etc) someone who will lay behind you while you sleep feel your heartbeat and kiss you when you need it.   someone whos good at sex. good at love.  someone with good energy. enough things in common to feel a connection. enough things different to learn about eachother.  good luck|`|724236ad3a6f20acded0447cbdeb28aaaa	Sonny, women are complicated creatures. It's like trying to stare too long into the sun. You're curious so you stare and stare but eventually you'll go blind from the UV rays. It's better to just put on some shades and walk the other direction.   A lot of times that's what you should do. Then there are those few out there that are just right for you. They are the ones you should lavish all your attention and care and respect and all of that good stuff on. The other ones? Just leave them alone.  You have to be patient though, otherwise you'll take in the wrong girl and have to give up your house, your car, and twenty years of your youth over stress from the divorce. You'll know who this girl is. It'll hit you.

It could be to protect someone from the truth. It is also your protecting someone from yourself. For instance, if you are a cheater and you tell someone you don't cheat, you not only not want to think about yourself that way but also that person not to think of you that way.

Go date the other schmoe you were dancing with.|`|zS33DHpuaa	no, i am pretty sure that him spilling the punch on you was probably an accident because he was probably really nervous and he seems to like you  a lot... why else would he get so jealous. It seems like he really cares for you. Remember this is just my opinion. Do whatever you feel is right... i don't know the whole situation... if you think he is a jerk dump him but if you don't why would you dump him?|`|8hNBA10Oaa	wow that's dumb. who cares if he accidently spilled something on you. I stain my  bf's shirts all the time and he wouldn't say it's over like that. plus ur his girl u went to the dance with him. why were u with another guy. of course almost any dude would do that unless they didtn care about the girl. And im sure he does care abotu you so u shouldn't dump him.

Be honest and direct, but not pushy.|`|JdxJDD04aa	There are no magical hook lines or anything.  Just be straight forward and leave no room for confusion.

Whatever is good for ya.|`|cc254bf1be58c4b727cbf2a635532c53aa	well i think u should ask for his number he'lll be so happy and if he thinks ur cute then he'll be happy for the whole day k  tell him u think  he's cute or u think he's funny or hilarrious|`|tgLiEZKTaa	The words that would do it for me as a hook line would be, "I've fancied you for a long time xxx would you mind if i sit on your face and wriggle"  Hope this helps.|`|W5tORqcxaa	figure out his scedule and make a time or day to talk in person with him.  asking someone to be friends or maybe more takes alot of questions from both sides.  if you like eachother your interests and where the relationhip will go once you start bein friends.  hookup lines are a no no.  just be yourself and be open and true.  if he like you for the real you he will take the time to get to know you better.  if all else fails just tell him how you feel you have a 50/ 50  chance that he may want to date you or just keep it on a level of friendship

Good Luck!|`|99011ec7559e453d8a03cbdc5b360e1baa	not really..maybe he was having another motives..probably, getting your comfort zone so he can take advantage..|`|f816bbca7b77c87c38800d5366cb046aaa	It's possible.  I get kind of uncomfortable when guys walk WAY too close to me.  :D  He probably knew he was a little close to you, esp if your hands kept brushing against each other, and probably took it as a good thing that you didn't move a little ways down the sidewalk...  Unless he is from another country!  A lot of other countries don't have the same sense of personal space that we do.  So anyway, it could be flirting, but I wouldn't make any sort of deal about it until there is a little more substantial flirting going on.

M6HY7Zrsaa	I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling so sad right now. But you cannot judge him soley on what he has done in his past... he can't change that. This may sound silly but he probaly takes a bath every day :) and by the time you guys do the deed it will be clean as a whistle!   There are probaly things in your past that you aren't proud of or at least wish you could change (if even a little bit) but you can't you can only move forward.  So with that said if you love him LOVE HIM. You will get through this, maybe you are just having a rough day. O and please believe on your wedding day (which is probaly a long long time from now you sound like you're a teenager) you will be way more concerned with how your dress looks then some hussy that was being grown before her time.    Muah!    And being a virgin this day and age is so unheard of. Kudos to you!|`|59lpsOCdaa	just give it up already just have sex like the rest of the freakin world waiting till yer married is b.s|`|4f0e9423472fa8f728a93a26bd0d0867aa	lol............ ur bf's ex already broke up with him. its obvious that ur current bf cares for u way more than he cares for his ex. Just dont think about it.|`|4h61gdHiaa	It's okay, really. Just remember how much you love him. It hurts a lot but remember that you love him and he loves you back. He's willing to wait for you.

Get over it.  You know there are people who marry someone who's divorced right?|`|c11827f731039885bd9b94b8ad38777baa	This is going to be a little harsh but it's something you need to hear.    First of all, he is a man and it is the 21st century it's great to wait for sex but just because he didn't doesn't mean he doesn't love you and it does not mean he is messing around on you with her- she is in the past, you are only human so it probably hurts just a tad. But it shouldn't make you cry.    Irene, it doesn't sound as if your emotionally stable to have a relationship, you shouldn't imagine them having sex and it shouldn't hurt you knowing he had sex before he met you.     I'm not going to tell you to find someone who hasn't had sex because that is stupid and you obviously love him, but you need to grow up. Your emotionally unstable .     I think it is great you are waiting for marriage - I personally am a virgin and I'm simply waiting to fall in love. It's a matter of choice, don't let it make you sad. He loves you and that's all that matters and one day if you end up marrying he'll be with you- you do need to talk to him about this. Let him know how you feel. But it isn't something he should apologize for, or feel bad about. So don't make him feel that way.|`|fcdc1e6747dd11145d08d94b00a73ec3aa	Girl, from what you're saying, your grasp on reality seems to be tenuous at best.    WTH kind of world are you living in? Are you saying that people having sex is not normal? In an age of enlightenment and freedom, how can you still have such backward ideals?Personally, I think it's wrong to objectify another human like this, the way you are objectifying that man.     If you've been with someone for 2 years, and have not had sex, clearly there is something wrong with your relationship.     Frankly speaking, if he's had experience, he'll only be BETTER at it, and not worse, so I fail to see how you think its a bad thing, really. What you have to understand is that love and sex happen, in fact they are quite normal in one's life. That he loves you now is more important than anything else.|`|ReBOK8WKaa	He had her and left her.  You, he wants enough to wait for.  You win!

Oh boy...  This is a serious issue for you.  It's something you might need to talk to somebody about... seriously.  If you can not get over this, you shouldn't marry this man.  It'll make your sex life horrible with him, you simply wont want it.  It doesnt sound like you do now....   It's called jealously and envy for what she has taken that you can not get.  It's in there, dont lie to yourself.  You wish you could have it, but it's gone.  You need to accept that and get over it or move on and find a virgin that you can "pluck".|`|286962d061bac0344eb8826c55c0f98caa	I think you should just talk to him about it!

Remember you made the choice to stay a virgin until marriage. Not everyone agrees with the idea or has the strength and courage to take the stand. He hasn't had sex in 2 years and he is prepared to wait for you, that should be enough.|`|a7076370ac53ad57d25c0c24d8c190e1aa	it's life. It happens. Maybe he regrets it, maybe he doesn't, but it's over and he can't take it back even if he wanted to.  It might hurt to think about, but just remember, hes with you for a reason. If he didn't want to be with you, he wouldn't, so think about the good things. He's yours, that other girl is old news, so try to focus on you two, not his past flames.|`|a9fa5fe1c62fd6b637cdb68a3af9e24caa	I can understand how you feel.  If i was in a similar situation i woud feel the same.  It's hard, when you've spent your life with high standards keeping yourself for that special someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with, to know that the other person didn't do the same.  I am also planning on doing the same, which lots of people say i'm crazy for.    I don't know if you are religious person (specifically christian of some sort), most people who want to save themselves are.  If you are then you can take solace in the fact that Christ made a way for us to repent, and if he's repented and changed his attitude those things are forgiven him in God's eyes.  If they're forgiven in God's eyes then we shouldn't worry about them either.  He would be as pure and clean as if it'd never happened.  Just find it in yourself to forgive him and love him anyway. God can help you with that too.    I hope this helps.  I'm sorry, that's a tough situation.|`|01ef0137587ead6164d9d3f4a67ef386aa	Never picture.

If he is supportive of you and your decision and your relationship, then he's a good guy - worth it. Keep telling yourself that. And hopefully when that day comes, it's going to be wonderful :) (ohh yeah and tha girl that took his virginity won't matter cuz he'll be "working" it with you) :)|`|19d00a2d61ec917f60c7b5519af0b5a1aa	Did you watch Family Guy last night?  Funny episode.  It was about what a crazy idea it is to wait until you're married to have sex.    Seriously - you're obviously putting way too much emotional emphasis on it if you're crying over his ex because they did it.    What happens if when you get married you find out you're not sexually compatible?  Then you're really out of luck.    So picture yourself having sex with your boyfriend.  Even better HAVE sex with him and you'll forget all about his ex and so will he.    Until you do it with him, she'll be his sexual memories.|`|b12c08fb04f12ed6f6807bba0186fd09aa	Has he proposed already? If so then you need to make sure that your going to be able to forget or at least put it past you. Living in the past (even if its someone else's) is never good. Your marriage/relationship will fail if you dwell on this.     If you arent engaged then all above applies but you shouldnt be worried about your wedding day because its to far away. And you will be way to worried about a million other things that day anyway.

Do you have a job...are there people that you feel you could socilaise with outside of work. Just go up to them and be like.. does any one fancy a drink down your local pub or something. I think you will need to make the first move.<br>  <br>  If you dont work... have you considered university. Its a great way of starting a fresh and making loads of new friends. People are in same situation. No one really knows any one else...and every one is in the same process of making new friends. <br>  <br>  You didnt say how old you were... but university courses are becoming increasingly more popular with mature students..so dont feel that you would be in a room full of teenagers.<br>  <br>  Not only will that you get you doing something abit new but it will also get you concentrating on your chosen career.<br>  <br>  Another idea is www.match.com??

That probably came from my awkward childhood which involved me moving 16 times. It was hard to make new friends when I moved at least once a year. I am 18 now and have a great social life.

Confidence is the key to being "cool".|`|Ym1vJtXfaa	hang out with other OCDs like yourself...|`|0pN8LMBxaa	I know the perfect thing.

It's a good way to get back in touch and you can get your old friends back instead of meeting strangers.<br>  2)You can try meeting new people. Where to meet them you ask? Go out and do some new things. You will meet people with the same interests as you. You have to get out and try instead of just sitting around. After you become friends, you'll have everything you want.<br>  Just try doing these things and you won't be depressed or anything.|`|Ek0eDO00aa	Good luck. It seems we've built a society to keep people indoors - beer is cheaper in the supermarket than the pub, all the decent pubs (where all the characters, misfits and eccentrics used to frequent) have been converted to bars or flats, towns are built for cars and aren't really places to loiter in unless you have a purpose (ie to go shopping). Modern life eh? No wonder so many people are anxious and depressed.  <br>  <br>  I'd say join a club - but even then people can be guarded, the nature of the UK today. And if you start one yourself people don't turn up and waste your time...<br>  <br>  Maybe it's about time us meek should claim the earth! Kick out all the politicians, fat cat bankers, corporations and supermarket giants that have blighted our society?|`|zY7boFYNaa	Ah, I feel very bad for you, but I had depression for three years but I got out of it after, I realized that is no use, and people called me a loner, and anti-social and no one could REALLY understand me, but do not lower yourself like that, BELIEVE there is people out there you can meet, motivate yourself out there, bring out the person who you are, I know you are missing that part of your life, and it is never too late to start now and a new beginning, have the confidence in yourself, talk to new people, do not scared at all, do not worry what people will think or whatnot, I know deep inside of you, you have potential of having a good social life, you have to find it, and with these issues you have, made you stronger person and a different perspective in life, and once you show people throughout your issues, it's such a beautiful thing to see. You can do it, Always motivate and do better for yourself even through the negative, do not give up on what you want to do!
65m62rDraa	Did you ever ask your siblings that question? I bet you they feel the same too. The grass is always greener on the other side.Since you are living in your own world, you feel your needs are greater, and should be addressed. When parents have more than one child they must address their children's needs and wants. Sometime parents prioritize their attendance to their children's needs by what is most important, while other times they try to help the one who seems to need the most help. It might be that you can handle more on your own, because you are more independent, or more capable, and so they choose to help your sibling, who seems to need more help. If you feel you are mistreated by your parents, maybe you should let them explain why.|`|ggwV238Maa	yea its proabably because they are actually aliens and dont know what else to do

An 11 year old can do allot of things around the house.  And if her mother is able she can do some, too.  You have yourself and an unborn child to take care of, and your baby and your own household.  As long as she has an able bodied husband and daughter she shouldn't expect everyone else to stay all day and help.|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	It sounds like she is depressed. As someone who has been in your SIL's shoes, several failed IVF cycles and a pregnancy loss, I can tell you, it is devastating. I am sure your toddler and pregnancy make it even harder for her. She is envious and heartbroken. As for the way she treats her daughter, she is her baby and only one right now. It doesn't make it right but she is doing what she needs to do to cope. Try and empathize a little. How would you feel if you miscarried right now? Sorry to be so blunt but it is a horrible experience especially when you have come so far. And the desperation for a child is unimaginable and unless you have been there it is nothing you could understand. <br>  <br>  You SIL had a pregnancy loss and she is going through treatment again. Her doctors are doing everything they can to help her carry a child to term. If that means bed rest then you bet she will do anything she can. If you cannot find it in your heart to help her out then I am sure she would not want you there. I would not want anyone who has no compassion for me to help me. You have a toddler, you are pregnant, and I am sure very tired. But is helping your SIL "Not fair" or is it a kind hearted thing to do?
6ac2fc49a54f0441ca00edc47c257e63aa	I was also little over weight there for 6 years and  from life experience have realized that if people are just ignoring me because of it then they are of no importance to me. I have learned to move on with my life and not worry what others thought of me because when i did worry what others were thinking of me i found that I was over eating more and i felt more depressed. so sweetie ignore those that tease and ignore you and poke fun because the only reason why they do this is because they have low self esteem also they are lacking the love kindness and smartness that you have and they are jealous of you. the hateful things that people do...... try to look deep inside and ask God or your Higher power to help you see the Good in them and that will help you my friend get your self esteem boosted back up and if interested lose weight. but you have to come to a realization with your self that you love you for who you are. So basically you have to be comfortable with your self. Also this is real golden opportunity  to find out who your Real True Friends Are. Good Luck....and GOD BLESS!|`|aee8316837d471fcec00e37d6053028faa	they could and most likely are thinking that your ignoring them.. you should talk to them and not worry so much about the size of you compared to whats inside of you as a person :) :) :)|`|893a5baeae696af16aae014286759723aa	Forget about body weight... it is natural.

I know that i should lose my weight but not for anyone else but for myself, not to look and feel good about myself but more to look after myself...so hopefully one day soon you will realise that these people are just so mean and that you dont want to have friends like that. s

If you told i don't think you would be telling for the right reasons. I mean you would be breaking up their relationship in which if you did that he wouldn't want you anyway. Even if he did what makes you think he wouldn't do the same thing to you.<br>  <br>  I think that if he thinks you are worth being on more than a sexual level then he will be with you. If not it isn't your job to tell his girlfriend that he is cheating on her with you because if you did that I think you would deserve every last kick and punch she gave you.<br>  <br>  (Sorry) Let him do it. If he wants to be with you then he will leave her if he just trying to have sex with you or feel on you why in the world would he leave something that might be promising to be with you?<br>  <br>  I am not trying to hurt your feelings I am not trying to be mean but just think if you were his girlfriend and someone did that same thing to you. It would be a good and a bad idea. Seems like you just want him to be with you.|`|Y6YaMR34aa	wat that girl said|`|xXGn1zfsaa	If you think she should know, I think you should tell.

Think about if you would want your friend to tell YOU if your boyfriend was making advances at her. <br>  If you feel it's wrong what he is doing, go ahead, tell her.|`|j6O8UiFjaa	YES you need to tell her.|`|m2eHPeciaa	lol, if he's cheating on u, thats not ur place to decide. it should be up to him and be a man n tell his GF.

My mother, bless her heart, gave me some words of wisdom that have helped me my whole life -  not just in dating, but in all kinds of social situations, as follows:    ASK A QUESTION!  Preferably, ask a question that does not have a "yes" or "no" answer.  It's easy!  Who . . . What . . . Why . . . Where . . . When . . . and  How.    The possibilities are endless.  I just thought of the following right off the top of my head:        Who . . . did you want to be like when you a kid?  Who . . . is your favorite athlete?  Where . . . have you gone on vacation?  Where . . . would you like to go if you could go anywhere in the world?  What . . . do you want to do this summer?  What . . . do you think about global warming?  When . . . is your birthday?  If you could have anything you wanted, what would it be?  How . . . many siblings do you have?  Do you like being the "youngest," "oldest?"  Who . . . would you invite to a party if you could choose any 10 people in this world?    People love to talk about themselves, so questions are a great way to get them open up, and to keep any conversation moving.  If, on the other hand, he doesn't ask some questions in return, he's either very immature or self-centered, and she really need not waste her time on him.

Good luck finding your niece.|`|8c000a8b8be8213c02e0a32ca2c83046aa	Try yahoo search.

J1D51dvpaa	My husband was the type that didn't take girls home so when i appeared through the front door....... well, i was apparently the wrong candidate and would ultimately hurt her little boy, but she was very smart about playing nice with me. And when she saw we were serious , she stabbed a few knives behind my back.  You just have to put up with it. Pretend you don't notice anything, Any move you take will be wrong- specially taking it out on your bf who already has to stand the subtle and not so subtle pressure.  Always try to be nice , but not too nice- b e a little indifferent  Avoid all clashes which might sever a future relationship. My mother in law is a very nice person NOWADAYS.|`|IdvJRR13aa	maybe its because hes grounded? or maybe hes the one that doesnt want to see you? i mean if his parents lik you then there are two ways you can look at this, he doesnt want to see you so he makes these excuses and it helps him get out of it. but on the other hand maybe his parents just sya they like you but they dont really see yu and your bf making it a long time? the next time you two talk ask him if his parents really do like you? tell him not to lie about it that its ok if they dont you are just wondering. that way you know for sure    the resion i say there are two ways you can go is because my little brother has a gf and when he doeesnt want to talk or see her he says my parents wont let him.   but when he does want to see her and talk with her even though hes grounded my parents let him because they really do like his gf. so its one of the two or maybe his parents are just real strict? any how good luck with everything!
hPkWZh3xaa	The issue is, he is happy and content where he is, and the benefits it gives him.  He is quite happy to date you, but you want more, such as sharing a home and life together which any independent person would.  Your bf just isn't prepared to compromise the cosy life to be a real partner to a woman.  He wants the best of both worlds. I think any woman would complain at this, but if he can't see it, it's probably because he and his brother were brought up that way. Sadly the mother's clingyness is gonna result in them both being single and living at home all their lives if they don't see the light.|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	A LIFE! <br>  <br>  sorry, but that sounds a little pathetic. <br>  <br>  You, at 20, are more mature than --- and his bro too. <br>  <br>  move on, your life is going to bright (and not by moms lights)

If this is first time try the park/beach or a place where you guys can talk. <br>  If he is the sorta shy type tell him your fav. thing to do and go somewhere you guys can both have fun.<br>  If you still aren't sure use this as a last resort:<br>  Get on a bus and get off where ever and just walk around and look for something to do.|`|828ac86c4aed6b8aab5980e0aa7d0831aa	Well..I know at my school spring sport tryouts were this week. Is he going out for any sports? Did he play any in the last couple seasons? Hmm let's see....he's 17.. is he a senior? If so I guess you could ask where he's looking at college. Or if he's a junior ask what he wants to take next year and see if you have any classes together. Or you guys could watch a movie and that would give you something to talk about later.... Just let the conversation be as if you were talking to a normal friend and if it's meant to be then it won't be that hard :)

114539ac88e5f7b7761143a795fbccabaa	Well, with most of the guys I know, that would mean he likes you a lot and he wants to "keep you around".    But if he is a little wierd, he might want to KEEP you in a closet and only bring you out to play.    If he puts a real sturdy door on the closet and then installs a super tough lock that only works from the outside, you better get out of there because he is planning to stash you in the closet......|`|73211431bfc5d82ad1b65eda95f3bf72aa	boys r like the dream partners every girl must live with, lol.  but whatever u have written was probably something u should think about urself.|`|AA10913242	are you that stupid?|`|bf829e7dfc30701ab8496e70fb12eda5aa	he is starting to luv u|`|AA10778627	it is a simple english...you don't need to have a translator for that.|`|dcb5b306dda3b53ee6156c20da765b8baa	He is tired of flirting with other girls, doesn't want to be with anyone but you, wants to stay only with you.

Players often know the right things to say and are usually very convincing.  Mostly you have to realize that & repeat to yourself constantly.
