I hope I have helped!|`|AA10570173	You cannot legally get Photoshop for free, and asking for this is  a violation of the Community Guidelines. You can get the educational version (also called a student license) for less than 1/3 the retail cost. Your school, if you are a student, may be able to help you. If they can't you can still get it from legal resellers such as JourneyEd.com or AcademicSuperStore. You will have to prove you are a student, but your school can help with that.    You can also try gimp from www.gimp.org or gimpshop or paint.net at www.getpaint.net, all of which are similar to Photoshop, and legal and free. They are Open Source software.    Most likely you don't need full Photoshop. It's really aimed at professional photographers, graphic designers and digital artists. You would probably find that Photoshop Elements, which is the consumer level product, will be more than enough for you and it's less than $100.     Think about this: there is a reason things like Photoshop are so expensive. Many people have spent hours and hours working their rears off creating, developing and testing this product. It requires technical and creative know-how, skill and effort to produce something like this. It is not something somebody just whipped together. When you ask to get something like this for free you are disrespecting all the people who work for Adobe. You are also disrespecting the creative community that knows how to use this product and has paid properly for it. Some of the cost of this product is because Adobe has to protect its products from software piracy, and they pass on some of that cost to those of us who actually pay for the product.    So if you can't afford to buy something legally, instead of asking how to steal it, ask what alternatives there are. I've given you several.  Good luck.|`|99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	There's actually an Adobe Photoshop program online called Photoshop Express.

Ensuite tu insre le cd d'installation de  Ubuntu Linux dans l'installation il te  demande ou l'install , alors tu choisis  la partition vierge que tu a crer dans  Windows.    A la fin de l'installation de Ubuntu , au  dmarrage tu aura le choix entre Linux  ou Windows  (simplicit)    Je utilise Ubuntu pour l'internet et le  graphique , tous les logiciels sont  gratuit et tu a aucun anti-virus a  install sous Ubuntu.    Qui veut dire que ta vie est mieux,   moins de stress et pas de virus.    Aussi l'espionnage de Windows est  un vritable cauchemar sans fin , les  mises a jours en fini plus , c'est la merde.|`|3SlwYW3Waa	Nope ?a ne ncessite pas la dsinstallation de windows. Seulement, comme le boot loader de linux gre windows et pas l'inverse, il faut installer windows d'abord et linux ensuite.    Parmi les distributions de linux orientes nophytes reviennent souvent les noms de mandriva et ubuntu, sinon.|`|ea9c9cc4802727d02fbb6f92188a4743aa	Bon courage moi je prfre pas m'aventurer  ?a|`|qmHOal8gaa	Bonjour  C'est une question de choix . Je suis sous linux depuis plusieurs annes et j'en suis content . Je n'ai jamais eu de virus ,et gratuitement et lgalement j'installe tout ce qui m'intresse .J'ai internet ,je chate ,je fais de la photo il y a plein de jeux et j'en passe.  Pour installer linux il est prfrable de le faire sur un second disque qui sera donc en esclave .  Comme il est dit ,window doit tre install le premier.  tu auras le choix de dmarrer sous linux ou sous window  Si tu prends une mandriva(2008-1), l'installation se fait presque automatiquement un peu comme avec window.  La seule chose  laquelle il faut prendre garde , c'est de possder du matriel compatible parce que les fabricants ne font pas toujours de driver pour linux   exemple une imprimante lexmark tout en un n'a jamais fonctionn. J'avais contact lexmark qui m'a rpondu . il n'y a pas de driver linux. Par contre j'ai du matriel epson un peu ancien qui fonctionne trs bien .  En ce qui concerne les documentations et informations ,j'ai cre un conpte sous" linux pour les nuls" , il y a des tutoriaux bien faits et des faq ,j'ai eu  chaque fois des rponses  mes questions .  Alors pour finir ,un conseil , lance toi tu ne sera pas d?u.  Si tu doutes encore , tu tlcharges une knoppix 5.1. ou la dernire kaella ce sont des distributions qui tournent sur cd sans s'installer ( tu fais dmarer ton pc en placant le first boot sur le cd et tu dcouvriras par toi mme les possibilits et la stabilit de linux pour le prix d'un cd+1 dvd  bonne dcouverte  amicalement|`|JgKlpZowaa	Ensuite passer  Linux, cela dpend si Linux est adapt  tes besoins ou pas (si tu veux plein de jeux 3D passe ton chemin, mais si tu fais de la bureautique/internet/multimdia, ?a roule).    Cela ne dpend pas de ce que font les autres. D'ailleurs si tu cherches  savoir quand il y aura plus d'utilisateurs  installer Linux que Windows (la majorit, donc), je peux dj te dire que ce ne sera pas avant plusieurs annes (si cela arrive un jour, mais je pense que ce sera le cas).    Personnellement, je suis pass  Linux il y a 5 ans, j'ai vir Windows au mme moment. Depuis j'en suis plus satisfait que je ne l'tais de Windows, mais en mme temps j'ai un bon profil d'utilisateur : je suis ingnieur en informatique.    L'installation de Linux ne ncessite pas forcment la dsinstallation de Windows. Ils peuvent cohabiter ensemble, c'est ce qu'on appelle le "dual boot".    Si tu veux dbuter, le mieux est de commencer par utiliser un live cd Linux, qui charge un environnement Linux  partir d'un cd sans toucher au disque dur (donc sans toucher  ton Windows). Je te conseille la Mandriva One. Tu trouveras des informations sur les sites suivants:    http://www.mandriva.com/fr  http://wiki.mandriva.com  http://lea-linux.org

Chop the string into a char array.  Loop through the array.  While looping perform the logic/code you want, like reading a case statement to find out what word each number becomes and output that to your text file.  Open the file for input before the loop and close it after the loop.

xS3I64m9aa	Yeah this has happened to me as well. Try opening the same page in Internet Explorer and see if it happens.

To set this option go to Word> Preferences. On the left of the window click save.  Then, check the last box that says "save autorecover info every ....

HD7L65fXaa	You are getting the same memory location from one call to p to the next (you need to understand about stack frames to see why).  The first time you call p, space for y is allocated on the stack, but no value is assigned, you get the garbage that was there at that memory location (printed).  Then that location is set to 2 and you return.  Since no other calls happen between that call and the next one to p, nothing steps on that value.  Again space is allocated for y, at the same location as before, just because of the stack being nested to the same depth, and no value is assigned, and the printf prints whatever value is there, which just happens to be the 2 left over from the previous call.  If you call some other function between the two calls to p from main, and that other functions has some local variables, and you assign various values (other than 2) you will see the behavior change.  Another way is to call a function that then calls p rather than calling p directly the second time, this will cause the stack depth to be different and some other garbage will be in the memory location to which y is allocated.|`|ge6iYfPCaa	The program is just printing what's leftover in the memory slot that gets assigned to y.  There is nothing that clears out that memory between printf's or changes it to anything else.  When y goes out of scope, it's memory slot doesn't get written over with some other number.  It just stays at what it was.  If you did enough OTHER operations between your two calls to p() it would probably be something other than 2 on the 2nd call.
UwQ5CpTBaa	Any performance gain is negligible. The bulk of the time goes to setting up a procedure call whether or not it has parameters.|`|hmsMpECkaa	If X = 1 go to subroutine . . .  else  If x = 2 stop.    But if you put -  If X = y go to subroutine . . .    you have to define y somewhere in the program.    If you do not define the parameter, the program stops and says 'huh, what do I do?'    That probably doesn't answer the question, it has been a long time since I did any programming.  But I would say that if the subroutine is never run, it would give you warning errors and keep running.  If you make a counter for the values in the subroutine, you might still have to put a decision limit.  But you would have to define everything.

jhauMhxTaa	Really your best bet is to take out your hard drive and then go from there.  You can hook it up to a device (that then plugs into a computer) and transfer all your info out that way, or you can plug the hard drive into another laptop of the same brand and upload the pictures to storage online.  Switch out the hard drives and then pull the pictures from online back to your CPU.|`|mrIzJRAgaa	Wow that sucks   Umm...Maybe you can call the company you got your laptop from and ask them.

There are lots out there try look on google. |`|yfHaNHfzaa	its easy, take out the HDD and use it as external HDD as you have, go to internat cafe and upload your files photos what ever, and then reinstall OS,    Got it.  |`|wdyLPavvaa	Usually when I take out the battery on my computer and then put it back in it works (battery is located on the bottom of the laptop). Try holding the power button for 20 seconds (this will turn it off if it isn't already, like if it looks like it's off but it isn't) then press the power button again and it might turn on. Also if it is out of battery try plugging it in. But don't take out the battery while it is charging because you might get electrocuted (I'm guessing). If your pictures are on a website then you can get them off one of your friends computers by saving them to a USB or something.

Start >> All Programs>> accessories >> System Tools >> System Restor.    the rest i think you can do.
GHZnLiYvaa	First of all, click on My computer icon and then click on Tools->View and select the checkbox view hidden files and folders.    1.)Click on Start->Run. Type in temp. Delete all the files.  2.)Goto My computer->Local C:/->Documents & Settings->Anshul(your user id)->Local Settings.    Over here, delete all the files in the following folders:    a)Temporary Internet Files  b)History  c)Temp    Then go back, and delete all the files in the Recent Items Folder.    Now, Go to Start->All programs->Accessories->System Tools->Disk cleanup    Select the drive where all temporary files were stored and you need to cleanup(usually C:).Select all the checkboxes except the old compressed files checkbox. Delete the files.  |`|irIxtiDVaa	type temp in run window. a window showing temporary files will appear. now delete them all. a few files being used currently can not be deleted. so delete the ones that are deletable. If disk space is a problem you can try removing hibernate option. This will give you as much space as your RAM is. i.e, if your RAM is 1GB you'll get 1 GB ..   You can uninstall few unused softwares. Or consider deleting some videos or music you no longer listen to.|`|hYFdzpzGaa	U can try out this software which is easy to use and is an excellent utility.    Ccleaner and it is free to download.

You can erase temp files by using Disk Cleanup..  - Open My Computer  - Right Click drive C:  - Properties  - On General Tab, click Disk Cleanup  - it will calculate how much space you'll be able to free on your drive.  - Check files/folders you want to empty. It's fine if you check all files.  - Then click OK    Just wait, because it may take several minutes depending on how large the files will be deleted.    I suggest to also Defrag your system after Cleanup. It is found in Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Defragmenter.|`|l9o5cfphaa	First press the windows or start key with the r key a sub menue will open that reads run / open there key in %temp% and press enter - again a sub menue will open, just deleat everything on it as they are normally just temp folders and are not important.  The defragment your disk and everything will be ok
WqZKskAWaa	 Using a registry cleaner can clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".  Every time you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time, the registry can grow to enormous proportions, especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and/or updating it's Registry entries.You need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast.Good Registry Cleaner will improve your computer and Internet performance dramatically!

Start >> All Programs>> accessories >> System Tools >> System Restor.|`|V9vwCa4naa	The reason the computer gets slow is due to the registry files becoming corrupted, or messed up, in simple terms. These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.    You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry. The registry Scan will identify corrupt files, paths,and registry keys causing your computer to have errors and run slow.Go to http://www.registry-bot.com to download registry bot.It is the most advanced and comprehensive registry repair product on the market.It will speed up your computer and make windows startup faster.   http://www.registry-bot.com free download Registry Bot.|`|czzcysQtaa	PCLive.com can help you with guaranteed service.

I'm not sure if we have the exact same problem, but I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with your connection [[unless you are having this problem on other sites as well]].     Watching videos in high quality seems to trigger the 'Video Not Available' for me.

AA10954511	Before you start on these, try to backup any important files. Everything should be ok, but since you are having an issue somewhere, try to backup and least the important stuff!      Im going to list a number of thoughts and actions, this list is pretty good so I'M GOING TO SAVE IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE! THANKS!. Realize tou triggered making this from all my scraps laying around. Hope it helps!    Virus:  Make sure your virus scanner is up to date and scan the whole C: drive. If yours needs to be renewed, You can replace it with AVG or AVAST for free. Also run the free one-time web scan from Trend at http://www.trendsecure.com/portal/en-US/...  Reboot & see if faster  **Sometimes you need to turn off System Recovery to get rid of some viruses***    Cleanup:  Run "Disk Cleanup" in Accessories, System Tools (do NOT compress the computer). (Note: CCLEANER program listed below can also clean out these files.)  Reboot & see if faster    Spyware:  Download and install Microsoft Defender to kill and prevent most spyware programs. Also download, then update, and run SPYBOT (available at download.com).  Reboot & see if faster    Indexer:  Right click on the C: drive, Properties, and unselect the Indexer. Ignore any messages.  Reboot & see if faster    Registry:  Download and run CCLEANER  Let it fix what's wrong and clean things up.  Reboot & see if faster    Programs Autostarting:  There should be very few programs running down near the clock. If you have a bunch, try to go into the respective programs and not have them run when Windows starts, programs like Messenger.   You can Start, Run, MSCONFIG and uncheck all but your virus Scanner and Spyware program to see if that helps. If it does, recheck them, edit the Registry and remove them from the Local Computer RUN section. (If you don't know how, don't do this part, and don't edit the registry!)    Memory:  How much memory do you have? Run the memory selector tools at: http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/ to see if you can handle more memory. You can use up to 2gb of RAM.    Defrag:  Kind of overdone. You should do it every 4 to 6 months.  Reboot & see if faster    Drive Fitness:  If your hard drive is failing, your computer can run very slow. Download Drive Fitness Test (DFT) from: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/support/do... and see if your drive is failing. If your drive is failing, I suggest replacing it with a new drive that is fast (like 7200rpm) and has a large cache (like 16mb). You can try to clone the drive (if its set up perfectly to your liking) with Acronis (http://www.acronis.com/enterprise/produc... Hopefully your new drive will come with a cloning software.    If you want to start clean (I do this sometimes), replace the old drive with the new one. Boot from your XP CD, delete all partitions, and then let it format in NTFS and install.    PC  Health:  Run the free test provided at http://www.pcpitstop.com/safe.asp and it will check the health of your overall computer.      Internet Speed:  Set your Temporary Files to delete on every exit by Internet Explorer Propterties, Advanced tab, and close to the bottom, check the Empty Temporary Internet files folder when browser is closed.      Thats about everything Ive ever done to repair my PC to make it work faster. Hopefully, something in here fixes your problem.    ***If you find the problem, please email me. Since I made the list for you, I'd like to know if it worked or if you found a different problem***  Good Luck,  Jim|`|sZd77pe9aa	Look do what I am telling if you wish & thank me if you get what you want.

QqkshhGKaa	To enjoy the thrill of all the newly added effects in FSX you would need a pretty fast computer. Or you will have to tune down the image quality, and it won't look much better than FS 2004. Also since FSX just came out last year, number of free add-ons is still very limited. On the other hand, FS 2004 has a lot of free add-ons which can enhance your game experience. So my suggestion is that if you computer is just average, you should play FS2004 for now, and wait till there are more free content available on FSX, and computer hardware price will probably have dropped by then, and do the upgrade and switch to FSX.

SriysGu2aa	The null character is used to indicate the end of a string.  It is denoted by either a 0 or the character '\0'.  Both mean the same thing.  Usually when you are suppose to include the null character, it means that you need to take into account that a null character exists at the end of the string.    Example:    the string "hello" consists of 6 characters: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', and '\0'.    I think that the requirement you are talking about is just letting you know that you don't have to add an extra character to your array to account for the null character.   Therefore your current declaration is correct.    char sentence[60];    If they said you needed to declare a string that could hold 60 characters, not including the null character, you would have to add one more character to hold the null at the end of the string.    char sentence[61];    Hope this helps.
00Nf4dwVaa	This is a common problem with Norton. My company use Norton, sometimes a faulty live update can also corrupted the virus signature files and disabled the anti-virus program.    You need to uninstall and re-install to get it working again.     |`|U9n960GYaa	Go into your control panel>programs & features and check the list of installed programs to see if it is indeed still installed.  If so, go back to your start menu (round orb on bottom left of desktop) and click more programs (if using Vista) and find Norton and right click it and choose "run as administrator".  This should wake a sleeping program if it has not become corrupted.  If this fails, it may be necessary for you to un-install Norton (using the Norton Removal Tool) and then do a clean re-install.    Norton Removal Tool:  http://service1.symantec.com/Support/tsg...    It would be a very good idea to download and run a different anti-virus scanner after you remove the non-working Norton.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	Well, it all depends on what you need.  Indeed the N is a newer option and supposed to offer better coverage and higher speed. It will only  do that if all adapters used are also N.  It is not a finished standard! So all devices may not be compatible (most are) and it may require a firmware update when the N standard is completed (most will).  It costs more.    G routers or B/G routers are very common 54mbs devices and usually provide good coverage for most people.  If all you are doing is internet access then a good G unit will be faster than the internet and will do a good job. You will save money as G/B routers are much less expensive than the N ones available at this time. Most existing adapters in laptops etc are G devices so G may well make a good choice.     If you do lots of LOCAL network file transfers etc, then N is a better choice as the higher speed makes that local system much faster (usually close to wired speed!)    Hope that helps.|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Yes N is the newer protocol, go with that.

Why you see caps around the cpu on a lot of boards--  They want some of that air too. As far as the chassis fan goes if you only have one fan it should blow air out the back. How high up in the case the fan is usually indicates the direction the air should be flowing. Rear fans are usually high up because thats where the warm air is in the case so, of course, you want to blow that warm air out of the case. Front fans are low because thats where the cool air is so that fan should be sucking that cool air into the case. As the cool air enters the case it warms up as it travels over the hard drive board etc so it rises and is then sucked out of the case thru the higher case and PSU fans.|`|isGbUq6haa	Yes|`|48oaZYv1aa	outward for me.    i have yet to see one blow inward|`|woGeAtddaa	The CPU fan blows inward(toward the CPU)  The front chassis fan sucks air in and the rear Chassis fan blows air out.

Prcautions d'usage : les fichiers sont lus dans un ordre alphabtique et seront donc insrer dans le nouveau document dans cet ordre. Prends donc bien garde  cel. Il te sera peut tre ncessaire de renommer certains de tes fichiers pour que l'ordre d'insertion que tu souhaites soit respect.  Enfin tu peut rpter l'opration autant de fois que ncessaire, car la macro redmarre toujours sur un document vierge de toute donne.

AA11434745	I am a fan of a three-tiered approach:    1. Look at open source code for something simple and hack it;; for example, find a simple database script on the Web and play with it.    2. Find tutorials / examples on the Web / in books that interest you and follow them. For simple PHP tutorials, I like http://www.phpbuilder.com and for all else, http://www.w3schools.com    I also lump in here the idea of task-based learning. You should look for solutions that resolve a specific problem because they show you what the language does, rather than describing what the language could do.    I could explain how curl works until I pass out, but it wouldn't be as effective as showing you how to load all the  elements from a Web page into a sorted array via curl.    3. You need a good book / reference source to fall back on to remember how to use / write code. For PHP that's http://www.php.net and for all others, w3schools again.    However, sometimes books are better and for the non-beginner, I prefer the Wrox books for reference; for beginners, I prefer Sam's Teach Yourself or For Dummies.|`|pYLGYXjpaa	you can takeing coarse or reading book|`|f81dbdcae476792a998c077cd733068eaa	Web:  http://www.w3schools.com  http://www.westciv.com/style_master/hous...    try to google "learn webdesign", "webdesign tutorial", "learn css", "learn html", etc.    List of books:  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Developme...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginners-guide-...

Friend,  Family,  Coworker, Classmate,  talk to a Tech suport guy at your local computer retail store..they will probably be willing to do that.    If you don't know them.. just work out the money situation.  Maybe go with them to the computer store so you buy the parts with your own money.  Maybe have them sign the contract promising to build it and then give it to you afterwards. etc.|`|FDm7feRoaa	Dell...

AA10517256	You can make the images open with programs other than gimp by right clicking the image, selecting properties from the drop down menu, and then clicking the change button where the properties window says "opens with:  TheGimp20."  You can then choose the program with which you wish to open the files to an image viewing program of your choice.  You will have to do this with each file type.  As for the saving of images off of a website, I do not know of any way of fixing that other than just copying and pasting the images into an empty image of the same size as the original image.    Another way of fixing these problems is to just reinstall GIMP.  (Despite being somewhat hard to use, it does have most of the features of photoshop.)    Also, GIMP is not spyware.  This is simply an unaddressed problem with the GIMP uninstaller.  Being open source, it would be quite obvious if GIMP were spyware.|`|xo7D8f7Haa	u mean the image files' extension has chnged? if its just tht u cant open thm anymore, right click the file, properties, choose open with and then choose windows image and fax viewer...then click ok...nd wat do u mean online images saved are missing? mayb its the same prob as above...|`|AA10908770	That sucks. I hate it when people recommend something, and when you decide you don't like it, and try to uninstall it, things get screwed up. Sounds like the GIMP is spyware. Sorry that I don't know how to fix your problem, although right clicking on a picture, and going to the "open with" and choosing a program, might solve it.  Don't bother with expensive photo editing programs. There is always good freeware available. Just be careful where you download it from, so you don't get spyware.

That way your friends don't have to be subjected to your idea of "cool looking", and just get to the information they're looking for.

XsnBYNwSaa	No, your computer will not "die" if you run a game that requires more RAM than you have. What it will do is "page."<br>  <br>  When your computer runs out of physical memory, it will start using "virtual" memory. This is "fake" RAM that's created by reserving some of your hard drive space for what most operating systems call a "swap" file (but windows calls the pagefile). You might even be able to see the pagefile if you look in your C: drive (it's called "pagefile.sys" -- but it's "hidden" so if you don't have hidden files/folders enabled, it won't show up). <br>  <br>  Anyway, this virtual memory is MUCH slower than real RAM, so you will hear your hard drive spinning up a lot when you play the game and it will probably run very slow if you're using virtual memory heavily.<br>  <br>  From the sound of your post, it looks like you're already paging (using virtual memory) regularly (from your comment of "my computer isn't at top performance"). So you probably won't notice a big difference. <br>  <br>  Consider buying some more RAM. It's cheap and can go a long way towards speeding up your computer. Check out <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a> for information on how much RAM your computer will support and what kind of RAM it needs.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Enjoy your game!|`|aHqrVMGqaa	No, the worst that can happen is that it won't run. Don't worry, your computer can't be killed by downloading a game. And such small difference doesn't really make any difference.<br>  <br>  PS: 504 MB means that your integrated graphics processor is taking up 8 MB, which is OK. That game says it needs a discrete graphics card, so the game may or may not run. But you're absolutely free to try any game you like. It won't harm your computer.<br>  <br>  @matt_smith: "it will fry your CPU and GPU if you leave it on..." call yourself a Microsoft certified, blah blah blah, huh? why the heck would it fry the chips in a properly cooled system? Even the stock coolers are designed to handle full loads. Besides, ALL modern CPU's and GPU's have thermal throttling anyways, so you can't fry them.|`|O9EmCFrYaa	No, it won't kill your computer.  The program itself will run slow or maybe not run at all, but there won't be any harm in installing it.|`|Vs6QUo3iaa	I dont think your computer will psyically let you.. <br>  <br>  but if it does you have no room for anything else and it will run incredibly slow.|`|cK1MKV95aa	no..it might freeze tho.|`|dILqe7nBaa	no the game will have problems running<br>  add more ram it is very cheap to buy|`|AA10485413	You probably won't be able to play it.  RAM is pretty cheap, the only thing you need to make sure of is that your computer has enough slots in your motherboard to add more. Try out the RAM utility at <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a>|`|YJdNqWL6aa	No, it wont harm your computer just that when you use it, it will freeze and lag a lot and you will have to restart everytime. But if you do leave it on it will overheat your GPU ram and CPU chip and fry them.|`|DmEPoG2iaa	It might not even download because of the lack of RAM.  You could try it.  If it does download you wouldn't be able to play it anyway because you do need the RAM.|`|zQUP91dPaa	your pc will not die but your game that you have downloaded will not run faster or it will lag or hang because the game needs more ram to be able to play.|`|o6XFZq93aa	Of course not, but the game will work very slow, or it wont even open.
AA10546930	As others have said, much more electricity is used if you leave it on all day.

Up to you, really, but turning it off is easier on your electric bill, too.

I take it you mean Internet history, so that's what i'm going with here.    I think most of us would need a little more info to help you dig into this.  Like when your PC boots up does it automatically log right into windows or do you need to click on a user and enter a password.  I'm going to go with one-user immediate login in this case.  Here goes...  right click your start button then click "explore".  You should see the windows explorer window pop up.  After it opens you'll be in the folder C:\Documents and Settings\%user%\Start Menu. %user% denotes the name of the account you're signed on as...  Now look up a couple folders and you'll see a folder called "Local Settings", Click it.  Next you'll see a folder called History.  Open that and you'll see all the webpages visited for the amount of time stated in your internet options.  Basically, its the same thing as hitting "Control+H" or the history button in your browser toolbar, but as you stated you have to "Dig" for it.  Of course this is all for Internet Explorer.    Also you can check how long it will store pages in history by hitting Tools, then internet options up top in the menu's.  A box will open, then look at the bottom... The bottom section is called History... there's a field where you can increase or decrease the amount of days you want to keep that info.    Hope that helps.|`|df2add02fabd28c2b86090b570ee7a66aa	Cookies and temporary internet files are what your looking for.    In Internet explorer its listed under tools>Internet options.

Use compressed air to clean between the keys.   Shake loose dust gently out of the keyboard.   Spray a small amount of fluid onto a rag.   Wipe the keys and chassis.   Reconnect the keyboard when it is dry and restart the computer.       This is the way you should do it but personally, after each time my husband use my keyboard (he has greasy hands), I put some Windex on a paper towel and wipe the whole thing (and the mouse too). Every week or so, I shake it upside down and then vacuum it using the crevice tool. Every year, I just take the whole thing apart (all those little screws and little rubber stuff, taking careful notes so I can put it back together) and wash everything (except the electrical part) in the tub with antibacterial soap.

The first thing to understand is that most viruses (which are the root cause of things like most colds and flus) and bacteria (germs) which cause less communicable illnesses like food poisoning are actually quite weak outside the human body and can't survive long.  To effectively kill these you should get a soft cloth and wet it with rubbing alcohol and lightly brush it over the keys (don't use so much that the alcohol spills out of the cloth in liquid pools ... you just want a damp cloth).  Don't rub hard either as you may damage the keys or the lettering on them.  Just a light brush to "wet the surface" is more than enough.   But a caution ... alcohol can sometimes dull the surface of some plastics, so test it on an inconspicuous area of the keyboard first to make sure it won't dull the finish.    After you gently wet the surface with the damp alcohol cloth, allow it to air dry and then don't use it for 10 - 15 minutes.   It should then be disinfected and safe.   You could also try the same cloth method using lysol (though this will leave more of a residue on the surface that you may have to wipe off with a clean cloth) or baby wipes .... though those are not as good as the alcohol.|`|cf154f9442831cb7afebf6f99e7c9476aa	Try this cleaning cloth.

That is used to get the network device (nic, wireless adapter) to connect to the network gateway (router).    Most network problems are fairly simple..    1.  The computers on the network do not share the same workgroup name.  2. The computers on the network do not have unique computers names.    3.  The firewalls on the network are not configured correctly to allow network connections.  4.  One or more firewalls are installed on a computer.    Disconnect the internet access from your router (just to be safe) and turn of the firewalls on each computer check your security center to make sure they are disabled.  Then go through steps 1-3 and see if the devices are negotiating connections the way you want them... Then bring your firewalls back on line and reconnect your internet.

KdcrSgiTaa	Yes ,it does cost you space... When you watch a clip or a movie on-line ,it loads either on your hard disk or your RAM (operative memory).   When you open websites ,the download on your computer (check in "Documents and Settings ,your user ,Local settings /sorry if I'm not very accurate ,but I'm on an Ubuntu machine/ ) .    It's impossible to see something from the WEB if you don't download it ...    Youtube and Google Videos use flash animation for example ;)|`|5ced462a43b4d1137fb1efb8c57496deaa	Umm I'm not really sure what you mean, but... if you download a movie or television show online, it will just take up space on your computer. Unless you watch it on YouTube, then it doesn't take up any space, obviously, since you are watching it directly from the website. You don't have to pay money either way. :)|`|0zhBswSEaa	yess my dear  U CAN'T SEE SOMETHNG FOR FREE  EVEN IF U OPEN A PAGE IT COST U MB'S  VIEWING A MOVIE ONLINE OR DOWNLOADING IT FIRST HAVE AN EQUAL REQIREMENT OF MB'S    WHEN U VIEW A MOVIE ONLINE IT BUFFERS (LOAD) FIRST,   ONLY THEN U CAN SEE IT !!

Better you check with your internet operator, whether they provide any unlimited free timing for downloading etc. If it is there, then you download all the things you want during that (free) time and watch it at your convenient time. I always do this, usually 10 GB per month or more, as my internet provider gives me 2.5 GB per month during day time. But between 2.00 am and 8.00 am, its free.

c56db09fe7bf9295198011c9a086e3a1aa	SSL 2 is secure sockets layer version 2. The reason why its unchecked by default in Opera's preferences is because, its an old and weak security protocol and just about a handful of sites support SSL v 2. It's virtually outdated and is replaced by SSL v 3 or TLS (Transport layer security). TLS is said to be another name for SSL v 3 protocol or higher. TLS 1.0 replaced SSL v3 in 1998.     As you can see in preferences, SSL v3, TLS v1 and v1.1 are enabled, what this means is that Opera by default will negotiate connections with secure sites (Https://) using these security protocols. Most of the https sites out there have already changed their configuration to support SSL v3 or TLS. Very very few haven't and still use the weaker SSL v2 protocol. This is why under preferences the SSL v2 option is still there so that you can enable it if you need it .    My suggestion to you, is to let it remain disabled!Most likely you will never need it. Is it good? No!. As i've explained that SSL v2 is outdated and weaker than SSL v3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1|`|f85459126cfd7c5ea3b1362df9d88d56aa	Internet Explorer comes with SSL2  (Secure Socket Layer) enabled by default.

Cheers:)|`|atE3E4YQaa	Check that you are forwarding port 80 correctly.  Providing you are attempting to connect using your router's net IP, and that port 80 is being forwarded to your box on the LAN by the router you should be able to see your site.      Look over your portforward settings again.  Make sure that you are forwarding to the correct IP address of the webserver.  Also make sure that TCP forwarding is enabled.      If this fails, perhaps you have a firewall issue. Make sure port 80 is open for inbound and outbound traffic on both the webserver (if it has a firewall) and your router.      Try downloading NMAP, and port scanning your router from a PC somewhere else on the internet - this will confirm which ports are being served on.      Finally, are you sure you are typing the ip into the remote browser correctly? Don't forget the http:// part.  For example  http://124.192.88.23.    Good luck - from what you wrote in your question you are definately on the right track.

You can also trying using recovery software downloadable off the Internet.    It all depends on the damage done. Try http://www.ontrack.com/ they are reputable, I bought $300.00 software from them and when I wasn't able to recover my programs using the software I bought, they gave me a refund so long as I promised not to use the software. They were nice enough to give me a quick refund so I never broke the agreement.|`|atE3E4YQaa	No it does not mean that your data is lost.  When you reformat a hard disk all that happens is that a table is wiped.  This table tells your computer where each file is stored on the disc.  Once it is gone the files still exist, they are just harder to find.      Because your computer does not know where the files are, gradually they will become overwritten with new data.  This destruction of deleted files is increased by the following:-  Deframenting the disk.  Writing lots of data to the disc.   Moving a lot of files around.      The best thing to do is stop using the disk straight away. Transfer the disk into another PC as a slave drive (ie not the boot disk).  You can then use file recovery software to scan the disk for files.  You should get a lot of them back as long as you did not do much work since the reformat.     The best software is probably ontrack, but it is expensive.  PC Inspector is a free alternative, and I have had luck with it, although found it not quite as effective as Ontrack:- http://www.pcinspector.de/file_recovery/...    Just remember, every second you continue to use the disc for everyday tasks you could be losing another file.  Swap the disk out and start recovery ASAP.

AA11613290	I would assume that the Codec you're using to play the DVD's isn't the correct one.    WMP is like bottom basment when it comes to playing Movies.  I'd go out and get yourself a copy of WinDVD, Nero, or PowerDVD.  These companies really only make software for stuff like this and they usually work quite well.    If you're dead set on using WMP you're going to have to search for the correct DVD codecs online.    You could also go to the site listed below and check the left column for Free Audio codecs.  Just download and install.
AA11613290	A lot of newer Dell laptops, especially the business line, the Latitudes have IR ports.  My work one specifically has one that i'm looking at right now.  It on the left side between the Audio inputs and the PCMCIA slot.  Its a Dell Latitude D610 the D620's also have an IR port on the left side.  I don't think they make that model anymore, they've since upgraded to 830's and 630's.     In looking at Dell's website you can see prodyct views of all the new laptop's but i don't see any that have IR ports.  The problem is that BlueTooth seems to be the preferred method of wireless transfers with laptops nowdays.    * still Looking......

ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	This depends on warranty issues. I have had a modem go bad and they just exchanged it. I assume you actually are renting the modem through your installation fee and monthly payments. There may be a service charge but it their equipment goes bad you should not be charged extra.  Second, since your provider is AT&T I have to assume this is DSL, sometimes known as 2wire. AT&T does have cable networks in some areas however.|`|Yse77tSraa	nothing in life is free.

m0fU0H7jaa	They pay people who are willing to work for Googlemaps as freelance photographers and researchers. These people travel the country looking for relatively unknown and off the map small businesses, taking pictures, getting information about it, and sending it off to Google.    As far as the 360 imaging pictures that they provide from the street level of residential housing, most of those are taken by Google vehicles that travel the streets with a "bubble" camera (looks like a security camera) on the top of them that take 360 degrees of pictures and splice them together in a large panoramic. Occasionally if you scroll all the way down in the pictures you can see the edge of the top of the vehicles.|`|ULw1777caa	Vans.
v8W02iwGaa	The GTX 260 doesnt require 550w. 550 Watts is the recommended amount to power the average computer with the gtx 260. That second 400 watt power supply is more than plenty for a gtx 260.

Additionally the increased heat from the upgrade may put stress on the fan
8b94f8ec6f5a2d3d585553dc6eda892caa	You can certainly download it your computer , but you will still need to create an image of the Windows operating system install disk  in to a CD -Disk using your CD Rom .    Again in order to install Windows you have to have your CD -Rom working otherwise you will not be able to run your install disk for windows.     My best advice is if you are not familiar with installing hardwares buy an external DVD-RW drive. you can plug that it like you plug in your USB and then burn the image of Windows in a disk and install it.    I hope that answers your questions.|`|pA8lfKbJaa	CD ROMs are pretty cheap and easy to replace.|`|IyCnihLmaa	Even if you downloaded it, you would have to burn it to a CD and install it from a CD.  Best bet is to buy or borrow a USB CD drive and use it to install whatever OS you want to install
oAV8fHrwaa	jUST PUT  AFTER EACH PICTURE...    ITS AS SIMPLY AS THAT...|`|wScYLSkwaa	I am not sure exactly you mean, but if you are talking about downloading a bunch of pics at 1 time, I don't think myspace is able to do that. I used to have a myspace and I never figured how to do that. I have a facebook now and it is a lot better than myspace. On facebook, you will be able to download a bunch of pics at one time.

48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	No. Defragmenter organizes the data on the hard drive itself by moving it around to minimize gaps between blocks of data. This allows the drive to read from your existing data quicker. From a user perspective you won't see any difference other than it might work a bit faster.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	No it wont. In anycase during a defrag (whatever defragger you use) ensure there is no power outage.  Also I recommend a reliable defragger like Diskeeper over the built in program.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	It will not cause any damage to your files, nor will it disorganize your files. If you've had Vista for more than a week, chances are that the defragger has already run atleast once in the background, since the default schedule is Wednesdays early AM.    However, the Vista defragger is painfully slow and rather inefficient. It also lacks a GUI, drive map, progress bar etc. If you are interested in an advanced defragmenter that has both fully automatic as well as manual defrag modes with GUI, drive map...then  Diskeeper is the best choice. http://www.diskeeper.com has free downloadable trial versions.
AA12180741	well if you copy and paste should be ok, but if your copying somebody Else's work and saying its your own that is a breech of copy write and plagiarism, its ok you reference it somewhere in the work this will be ok

WtwpzZXiaa	http://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpu...|`|vl6OtBfWaa	I have a quad processor so I will tell you what I know.  You have 4 identical processors running simultaneously instead of just 1 intel chip.    So even though it does not give you exactly 2.5 ghz X 4 you can think of it that way.  Now the processors you have divide work up and process it simultaneously so the work load is 1/4 per processor.    My processor is very fast but it is slowed down terribly by the horrible design of Windows Vista.  So it seems at times to run slower.|`|JCdhn4Gdaa	I am gonna put this simply, the quad core will be around 4-6 times faster|`|AA10185559	is ur current processor a single core?  if it is, then the intel core 2 is way better.    .5 isnt much of a difference, but a quad core is far away from the single core.

48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	Do you mean kb or kB?    If it's 523,280 kB then it's approx 523 MB which is just over half a gig.    If it really is kb (kilobits) then divide 523,280 by eight and do the same math.|`|OIC0vsEWaa	0.52328 gig for SI values    0.4990386962 gig for Binary    go here: http://www.easycalculation.com/bandwidth...    make sure you get your bits and bytes cleared up. find out which one you are using. there are 8 bits to a byte|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Approximately .52GB, which is 30% larger than my first computer's large-for-the-time hard disk. I remember fretting over kilobytes, but seems we no longer worry much about hundreds of megabytes! Progress; I love it.
76ea3a562a33cdae910d9e4983afb205aa	Safe Mode has nothing to do with keeping your computer safe from hackers.  If you are using it, you should know the reason why you are using it.   If your sound does not come on when you reboot normally, then you should check Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager and look for problems or missing devices.  Be very careful in this screen, you can easily cause yourself more problems that a professional would have to fix.|`|i9PhENN6aa	safe mode is for diagnostic purposes not for casual computer use. that's why safe mode only installs a basic set of drivers in order to function.
AA10654797	Forget the disk. Download the driver from the mouse mfgs website.
OndHr1yWaa	http://www.dlldump.com/download-dll-file...    Theres the file, download that. You need to go to "Start" then "Run" then type c:\windows\system32 then you need to copy and paste this file into there.    Download www.malwarebytes.org and AVG (free edition.) and run both of them, just incase a virus is messing around with your DLL files.|`|mp1MfFMraa	http://www.dlldump.com/download-dll-file...    You download it from there, and copy it to c:\windows\system32.
48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	The signal strength is really the limiting factor not how well you can receive. If a signal can only broadcast let's say 50 feet it doesn't matter how good your receiver is if your 60 feet away. Now I'll admit a really good antenae will can help but there is not really any good way to boost your computers wireless reception.    And while I'm sure you are away I do feel I should say using your neighbours wireless is illegal if they haven't allowed you to.|`|bdfdc7384598ecf1f144834588ae2b77aa	well if your using ur neighbors its free and kinda far so you cant get the best signal. from my personal experiance the cable wont help but if you need to download any software via the internet its the best way by using a cable. buy yourself a modem :P|`|FBQZ06vraa	Sounds like a hoax.  Cell phones, Ethernet cables and satellite dish antennas all have nothing to do with WiFi signals.    Hope that helps.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	It really sounds like a Print To File printer is set as your default printer in Windows instead of your HP, so that whenever you print you are actually creating files with the print information in them on your computer's hard drive (you can delete them if you ever find them).     Hopefully you've installed your printer (software, interface cable, etc.) onto your computer already, if not you'll need to do that first. Usually when installing a printer it will ask if you want this to be your default printer, check the box or select Yes as needed. This should take care of it, but if you didn't when you installed then you'll need to do this:    To check and change the default printer, open a document you wish to print, go to the menu bar at top and click on File, move down the pop-up window to Print... and click on it. In the Print pop-up window find your HP printer in the window at top and right-click on it and then click on Set as Default Printer then select Print or Cancel at the bottom. Now whenever you click on the print icon it will print out on your printer instead.    Best of luck.|`|1MeIEAPOaa	not really enough info     I have seen some programs that save before printing but they were dos based|`|TYgpLcXqaa	Tee printer driver or printer software is not properly installed. Check with uninstallation and reinstallation of the printer software. Also, make sure that you select the printer manually to which you wish to print.   More info would be helpful on this.

AA12351337	Basically it's what it says.  A driver is trying to be used for something and it won't work for it.  To check, right click on My Computer, got to Properties.  Click on the Hardware tab.  Then go to Device Manager.  The annoying part is that now you'll need to go through most of those.  Click on the " + " sign next to each.  If there is an exclamation point (!) on any of them, those are the problem.  Whatever drive has the exclamation point it means there is some sort of problem.  It might clarify or it will just say there is some error and it has been disabled.  From there you'll need to see what driver it is (Audio, Video, HID, ect.), and then find the right driver to replace it.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Get a compatible driver.|`|A3zczaJDaa	It really is self explanitory.  A driver is software usually put out by the manufacturer that causes their hardware to operate correctly and is needed by the hardware to operate at all.      If the driver is blocked because of incompatibility, that means you have the wrong driver for the hardware, either the model or manufacturer.    Go to the hardware manufacturers website with your hardware name and model number and search for correct driver.  Download the driver and usually it will self install.
GWO0OcFHaa	It is the Purple CD that says Operating System.  Try installing that one and restarting your computer.  It will most likey say press any key to boot from CD. Then it will install files which will enable you to install the operating system.  Follow the on screen instruction.  The other CD's contain drivers and software that was shipped with your Dell.

Youll want an OEM copy of XP home 32bit (unless you feel confident with teh 64 bit or pro versions)    put the disk in then restart the computer, the installation instructions are idiotproof, and itll give you the option to wipe vista|`|AA11049725	Generally speaking, most new PCs have Vista.  Some, but not all, have the option to "downgrade" to XP; but you would have to make this change yourself.    The only class of "new" computers that come with XP upfront are some of the "Netbook" computers like the Aspire One.  The catch there is it is XP-Home, not the XP-Pro most people expect.    So it's back to square one and the basic question most people miss; Why do you want a computer?    Do you plan to Game, do Office Stuff, Surf, watch TV, etc.    Solve that question, and the type of computer will become evident.
Zj7RHtoUaa	a loud computer can mean MANY things. The most common is a dusty fan and heatsink, which significantly raises noise level and loses cooling efficiency. Besides too much dust, it can also be anything from a hard drive that is dying, power supply dying, etc. basically anything dying usually makes some weird noises.

48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	If you emptied the recycling bin then it is much tougher but the songs are probably still on your hard drive. There are pieces of software out there that let you restore deleted files. Do a google search and you should be able to find one. They can be pretty technical so may want to get some help if the songs mean that much to you.    Be careful how much new stuff you put on your computer before you do that though because any new data written to your hard drive has the potential to overwrite the areas of the harddrive where your songs are sitting.

4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	this is something i found:     If you want to text, audio, or video chat with more than one buddy, you can connect an unlimited number of people in one text conference, up to 10 total people in an audio conference, and up to four total people in a video conference, as long as your system supports it (visit the iChat Support page for information about iChat AV system requirements). Here's how to set up a conference.    Select the buddies that you want to participate in your conference (hold down the Command key to select more than one buddy).  Click the "A" button to start a text conference, the phone button to start an audio conference, or the movie camera button to start a video conference.  As your participants accept your invitation, they will be able to send text, talk, or visually interact with everyone who joins.  You or anyone else can bail on the conference at anytime by closing the chat window; the chat will continue as long as there are still active participants.

Technically, government agencies exist in most countries to define what is officially considered `broadband`. In Malaysia, for instance, 56Kbps is the minimum to qualify as broadband. If you live in, say, Sweden, you might consider this to be slow. So it really depends on what you're used to.|`|XEpq107Iaa	That's really more of an opinion thing.

I use it and my computer is fast.    you should try it if you do not like it delete it.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Vista is prettier than XP, it's true but XP is certainly a lot faster and more efficient.  I have two drives in my PC, it came with Vista but I have set up a dual boot system because if I want to use the computer's power to the best of it's ability (like to play 3D games for example) then I do it with XP.  I use Vista just for things that aren't too taxing on the hardware, or if I just fancy having a nicer interface.  The main point is that I don't spend all day playing with Windows, it's just something that I have to load before I can actually run my programs.  As said, maybe it's worth waiting to see if Windows 7 is any more efficient than Vista.    Edit:  I have a quad core processor myself and XP handles it fine.  All benchmarks that I have run on my computer show it to be significantly faster with XP, between 10 and 30 percent, depending on the test, the same with just running a game with a framerate counter like Fraps running at the same time.  Never has anything shown it as slower.  You need a fast computer for Vista because it's so inefficient.|`|AA12121752	It isn't really worth it until you want to upgrade your hardware as well.  XP doesn't support the new quad core processors - so you need Vista for that.  Vista is a much more visually pleasing OS but if you don't have a pretty powerful machine it will be too slow.      Software & Hardware also move forward together so new devices will work better with Vista.  XP is still fine for most things in a no frills ryan air kinda way.      New hardware is very cheap if you buy a package which would be better when you decide to upgrade.|`|BVL85SAqaa	if the computer came with vista, then you might want it. don't get it if the computer didn't come with it. vista is a hog with less features and a higher price.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	installing vista on a computer built for xp is downgrading not upgrading|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Stay away from vista mate its crap.|`|VwToLXEDaa	There is no point as windows 7 is coming out in 1 year, And windows 7 is everything vista was suppose to be. So my advice is to wait until windows 7 is out. I think most people will agree with me.|`|caf5e6a5a934ce9e78c8e0bc4b430b1daa	If you are happy with Windows XP, you are doing well for now.  Next year around this time, Microsoft will be releasing a new operating system, Windows 7.  It is an improvement on Vista. If you can wait for that, wait.  Upgrading Vista has caused problems that are unforeseen until you upgrade.  You may not be able to find drivers for your CD/DVD drive, printer and other hardware that is working well in XP.  If you want to upgrade anything upgrade the RAM to improve your access time to your programs.  Save your money and wait until that windows 7 comes out.|`|522ea068fe4755c1147771bbcb8f651aaa	Even if you have the "Vista Ready" sticker don't let that fool you!  In some cases "upgrading" could be the worst thing you do in your computers life!    Vista requires a lot of things.  At the bare minimum it is suggested that you have one gig of RAM.  If you have less than two gigs of RAM on that computer, then I suggest you stick with XP.    Vista is a RAM hog, and requires a lot of video function.    *Doesn't like Vista at all*  My answer, no, do not upgrade.|`|TCpWVW4Raa	Vista is practically the same. I wouldn't bother, although it does have a nicer look to it but that's also a bad thing as vista hogs resources.|`|AA11977808	If it aint broken, don't  fix it  I too woukl hang on, if I were u    I bought a new tower at Xmas with Vista Ultimate pre-installed.   and a powerful Intel Quad 666 dual core processor    Within 14 days, I read Intel were introducing a new processor   and 7 days after this, the news of Internet 7 comes along   Boy,was I sick !!

6e493640b4ac78141e0378dfa50e5a8baa	Keep in mind that if you are trying to get two computers online at the same time, that won't work. Dial-up only allows one computer at a time.    From what you said, I don't think it's your phone cable. (It's a phone cable, not internet cable.)    The only other advice I can offer you is to make sure the modem in your laptop is correctly functioning. Without it, there's no way to get onto the Internet.|`|xdlsGvldaa	You can buy a new phone cord for connecting from a phone wall jack to a phone or lap top at any Wal Mart (cheapest), Radio Shack etc.  Also buy a 2 way splitter/adapter and you can hook up both the phone and lap top to same phone line and not have to plug and unplug the phone. Your lap top and desk top have a built in modem and if the connection set up for your lap top works in the room with the desk top it should work in other room for your lap top. There are two plug ports on the back of your lap top, one is for a cat 5 cable used for DSL, cable, satellite and networking, the other one usually next to each other is for plugging into a phone line, look closely and make sure your using the right one.  Hope this helps|`|OIC0vsEWaa	any home repair store will carry them. its just a standard phone line with a standard RJ11 connector.    you can hook your phone up with them.    best buy or target are good places to look.    they are relatively cheap|`|48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	What is the other end of the cable in your room plugged into?     Dial-up would mean the other end should be plugged into a modem. I'm guessing the cable in your living room is plugged into the modem and the one your room is not.    If you plug a phone into the cable in our living room does it work? I'm guessing not.    Unless you have some kind of network going which is a different thing all together.|`|a3d582acb2b30b257fb8d82c57713a25aa	The type of cable it is should be printed on the cable insulation. It's probably either Category 5 or Category 5e. You could get new Cat5 cables at Best Buy, Radio Shack, Circuit City, I've even seen them at Jewel -Osco on the Osco side. The color of it doesn't really matter, but most of them are blue when you buy them from stores.

Make sure you look and see what it is labeled as most are labeled right above the input (ex. my says Computer 1)  Once that is done get the remote to your tv. There should be a settings or home or input button.  Click it and go to input setting. Find "Computer 1" or whatever yours is labeled as and you want to hit ok and enable it.  Once that is done something should pop up on your laptop screen like external monitor found.  If not go into your control  and you'll find it there.  Once you click how you want your external output you should be good.  If this doesn't work e-mail me at MarinesSniperr77@yahoo.com.

GNtWomekaa	Yes - here's how.    1. Log into your myspace.  2. Up towards the top is a thing that says "profile" click it.  3. Scroll down and click "edit profile"  4. Halfway up the page is a row of blue links. Click the 2nd one from the left that says "name"  5. Type what you want it to be where it says "display name"  6. Click save changes, and you're done!|`|8p77P2rNaa	Yes, you can. Go to "edit profile" and it's either in the Basic or Name part. Type it in the Display Name bit.

6e493640b4ac78141e0378dfa50e5a8baa	Pentium?    That's insanely old processor. I wouldn't deal with it, since manufacture based motherboards are not as universal as other motherboards by 3rd party manufactures.|`|a3d582acb2b30b257fb8d82c57713a25aa	It won't work because the142433 Imperial_Gv motherboard uses processors that come in socket 478 but the 2008 Intel Pentium Processor 805+ is a socket 775.|`|48663f5ac73f99562c8debc62e61ac50aa	It's all about the socket type. Find the socket type for that processor and that motherboard. If the match then it will work. If they don't then it won't.    I think that processor is socket 775 but I've not idea what that motherboard is.
ZPBPwEQBaa	1 gt is better   2 the ram more is better with graphics cards look at the speed two I would get gddr3.  3 nether shop online at  http://www.tigerdirect.com/  Or  http://www.newegg.com/  For the price of them you can get a 9600gt which is allot more powerful then those.  see http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...  you can max out older games but some newer ones you need a 9800gtx to max other ones like crysis cant be maxed out with the filters even with a gtx295 which is the fastes out now|`|2arZOZWgaa	First: What do you consider most games? Something like Crysis or even Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is going to need a lot more than a 9400.    Second: The difference between GS and GT    "gt actually stands for gigatonne,a metric measure of mass ,which is why the gt is more powerful than the gs however the gs stands for general speed,and this is reflected in their speed difference with the gt"        Third: A video card has its own processing unit referred to as the GPU. The GPU accesses the video card RAM. Sometimes, the RAM will store simple things like screen images.    Fourth: The difference between the cards is the name brand, and since I am a big fan of NVIDIA thats what I would go with. But realistically, I would get a better card than that if I expected to play games the latest games on it. You will not be able to max settings with that card.
DdIPC2iNaa	i have the same problem. i added a friend, accepted. then i clicked on his profile, but it didnt work. i searched him and it said 'Add as Friend', which i already did. i added again but i dont think it was received. it's not in my friends list either and doesnt say 'You are now friend with.......' either.

ffhFfgqYaa	Well I'm not sure how she could do that without a software or keystroke program.    But try this:  -Make sure your profile is set to private.  -Try to change your password every now and then.  -If your profile is set to private, she can't do anything unless she's you're friend.  -The only thing she could possibly do would write Tom an e-mail and have your profile deleted.      Have you tried talking to her about it?  and explaining how you think it's a violation of privacy?  She might respect how you actually talk to her instead of just being grouchy and sneaky about things, ya know?  (I'm not saying you are or anything, but you know how parents are.)|`|s0zyoyljaa	yes. she can. some parental control softwares can monitor every key stroke. just install it on your computer and can see everything you type, even a password is visible.|`|OqVALZDAaa	keyloggers to be simple.  go to ctl+alt+delete then look at processes and see if theres anything suspicious.|`|Tn4J4mjfaa	Depending on how smart your mom is.  She may have a key stroke program recording what you do or something like that.  Therefore; yes she can.  There are programs for parents to monitor their kid's internet usage, the detail is the difference.    The truth is if you are scared about it, then quit doing whatever it is that scares you.|`|SuqYuobdaa	change your password to getoutofmylife or something and maybe she'll get the message|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Depending on the security settings on your computer, she would have the "administrator's clearance" do check on every stroke that has been put on that hard drive. Parental Control software or not. Peace:)|`|AA11091315	Not true.|`|aSdUzlIiaa	she cant log in but she can view your profile|`|AA10654797	She can probably see your new password already! Shes been around alot longer than you have....I'm sure she knows alot more than you think.  Sure I could tell you how! You think I'm gonna intervene in your mothers protection of you? NOT! I commend her!  Until you are eighteen and moved out of her house, she has EVERY right to be nosy! Get over it. It still doesnt change the fact that she can. Defying and resenting your mothers action CLEARLY shows your immaturity.|`|c4a36c088096bec045e2051f20d57305aa	Ha, she can, and I will not tell you, stop doing stuff she doesn't approve of.    I know, cause I  go into my son's at random, he changes his password, and I still get in.    Well apparently you are giving her a reason to feel like she needs to, and FYI that is not an invasion of privacy, it is her business to know what is going on in her house on the interner she pays for, if you were trustworthy she wouldn't want to check up.
2KfQYXaiaa	Your best bet is either to take out your own money (you can buy a laptop for $300).  All college will have public PC labs and some even have labs inside the dorms.|`|ULw1777caa	Ask mom and dad.|`|m0fU0H7jaa	It depends on your university and what you're going into. Small colleges sometimes receive grants to give laptops to their students, but at larger universities, it doesn't work this way.    Depending on the school, if you are going into certain fields such as graphic design, photography, or others within the liberal arts colleges, then you may receive a laptop.    Most of the time, you will receive no laptop compensation, grant money or scholarships for such. Apple does, however, offer student discounts that get you 10% off your Mac purchase for college.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	No, you'll have to open youre wallet a bit.

It looks to be a great machine for the money, and I'm thinking I might suggest my mum buy it to replace her obsolete notebook. Only con is the single-core CPU, but you can't complain about that when you've got such a tight budget.    http://www.buy.com/retail/Product.asp?sk...|`|J6awd9PDaa	some colleges allow the student to get a loan to get a laptop.  When I started going to ITT Tech, I got a laptop through the school. It was a Dell which by the way I regret getting.  Only reason was because I did not have a job and I needed the laptop.  I suggest you ask your financial aid administrator to see if you can get a laptop through the school

Like cyber_pete101 mentioned, the latest version of Internet Explorer is IE8 RC1. This is a release candidate that was made available to download early last week. As a release candidate, it is in the final stages of testing and therefore not the final version of IE8.    Here are a few great links you can check out to learn more about Internet Explorer 8 and its new, improved features.    This site actually gives you the opportunity to test some of the new compatibility and security features in IE8: http://www.ie8demos.com/tryit/      The official site also provides a good overview of all the new features, as well as answers for many frequently asked questions that users have. You can download IE8 RC1 here as well: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/interne...    I hope this helps,    Feran   Internet Explorer Outreach Team|`|6e493640b4ac78141e0378dfa50e5a8baa	You should.

Switch to anything, be it IE 7, Firefox, Safari, K-meleon, Opera... seriously, anything. Internet Explorer 6.0 is a circa-2001 browser that doesn't support many basic staples of modern Web design. Webmasters have to write their sites specifically to accomodate holdouts like you, because something like 50% of computer users have for some bizarre reason refused to move to a browser made in the last  five years. With every site you visit, you cast a vote for this ancient relic, so please, switch now, if only to help shrink the IE 6.0 user body as measured in the statistics site designers go by. Really, it causes the people who write Web pages quite a bit of grief to make things look decent in this browser, and if they didn't have to support it very well, Websites would look better.|`|And9dyrwaa	better use firefox|`|503fed175e4ab7f72f701c79a2eeefaaaa	no cookies viruses go with firefox|`|An2FpBRIaa	for security reasons! you may want to! if you hate a  bulky, 'bubblely" feel of vista... id say stay with 6.. or look into ie8!

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|L0fAWSdHaa	system restore|`|8s2EmKebaa	http://security.symantec.com/sscv6/Welco...    http://housecall.trendmicro.com/    good luck!|`|DGC4Ad6maa	I am not sure maybe you shd use "Iolo System Mechanic"...It Delete all system clutter , junk file etc....And makes pc fast as it was new :)...And one more thing Do you have Antivirus Installed?|`|s6hlJ64Oaa	Bye a system mechanic like that guy said and when your computer is powering up put it in and tap ESC when it is loading and then clic load from this disk.but if u can log on for a little bit be for it freezes up just put it in 1 u log i.And go to download.com and download avg free Anti-virus just type avg that should do it if not try to put your reinstallshin disk in if u have one.

You can also do intermittent (sp?) back ups every week or so.  The difference is, one will back up only the data that has changed since the last full back up.  That way, if the systems crashes, you have the full back up from a month ago, and then the recently changed data.|`|nSruFRwraa	it depends what you are backing up, if its a standalone computer u can choose to back files up as they change on a daily process in a pretty short amount of time, if you are backing up a server, you want to perform a normal backup at least once a week, and depending on your data recovery plan use either incremental or differential back ups each night.  incremental is a quicker back up solution, differential is a quicker recovery solution

E5mFWOqqaa	Check out Lenovo or HP. They have decent models under $700 that will last. Avoid Dell, Acer, Gateway, eMachines.    When you say price matters though, don't expect to spend under $650 and get a laptop that will last more than about 3 years.     What you sound like you want is a decent laptop that you can rely on to last a while so that you get your money out of it. If you're willing to sacrifice the "cool" look, I think Lenovo has a ThinkPad model (they last FOREVER) under $700. If not, the IdeaPad Y430 or Y530 is a great choice. They've got great parts and service and last just about forever.|`|4iJNpxy9aa	Well you could get a MacBook White, small, great nvidia graphics card, and the best operating system on the market!

hlDl0g8uaa	anything that is fun...especially video with some comedy.  Comedy clips always get high views.    or anything you like doing.. e.g. funny slideshow showing really funny pictures of like Jim Carrey,  making cute and funny animals slides, etc...    also...    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

dkpIjt5jaa	How much power is necessary for the average PC system, if there is such a thing nowadays?    ( Source = http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power... )    If you are going to add more peripherals you need to seriously consider upgrading your power supply.    For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately how much wattage you will need to run various common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):    The Motherboard: 15-30  Low-end CPU: 20-50  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100  RAM: about 7 per 128MB  PCI add-in card: 5  Low to midrange graphics board: 20-60  High-End graphics board: 60-100  IDE hard drive: 10-30  Optical drives: 10-25    So let's calculate a system with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including the 2 (high-end) graphic cards), 2 hard drives and 2 optical drives.    That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+200(2 X 100)+60(2 X 30)+50(2 X 25) = 679    So compare your computer specs with the list and do your own math, you will then know what PSU you should get (NOTE: Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 800 Watts and check prices to get up to 850 Watts if the price difference is slight)    As for 1.5 GB of RAM vs 1 GB of RAM, if you are on a 32-bit system, hardware always steals about 0.5 GB for internal use so you will have 1 GB free instead of 0.5 GB available to you.    If you use a 64-bit system, you get the full benefit of the additional 0.5 GB as no RAM is stolen by hardware.    In both cases, the additional RAM will slow your computer from taking Virtual Memory (Hard Disk Space simulating RAM) and that is good for performance as real RAM is faster than Hard Drive seek time.|`|AA12180741	well if you install a highly powerful graphics card in a pc with a power supply not enough to run it, you'll run into some major problems  also adding more ram will help, it depends on quality of ram you get.|`|ykXzzx65aa	Well if u have a VERY good 300W it might work, u should try, and if it doesnt work, get a new PSU    taking out ram wont help|`|vo42ZRPdaa	you probably miscalculated  cause thats very low unless your using a full integrated system (all in One motherboard)as a cpu such as a core2 duo and cdrom and hard drive and sound card and 1/2 a$$ed video card will be over 300W  rangeso add a full blown video card and you'll kill the PSU  you seriously want to have no less then 500W and look for a major name in the 750 W with at least 80A of power and multi rail    and no you will not notice a huge difference in performance with that memory  XP needs 2 GIGs and vista needs 4 or more to run correctly|`|WtwpzZXiaa	i would upgrade your PSU .. i wouldnt take the chance of frying any part of your computer cause you underpowered it

vBWw77Ydaa	Not in myspace 1.0, without re-copying the player (and hiding the original), OR making it the only thing inside the scroll box. (And even making it the only thing inside the scroll box is subject to potential side effects on other div elements.)    You have more flexibility in myspace 2.0.  The columns are div elements.  By dragging everything you wanted in the one scroll box, into the same column, you could then use overflow:auto to make it scroll.  It is not as simple as just giving you a code.  It would be a combination of steps, to get this desired effect.  The exact steps would depend on what else you wanted in the scroll box and where you wanted the scroll box.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	Usually all you have to do is use a WEB BROSWER, internet explorer, safari, etc  Open your routers web based configuration.  It all depends on the brand and model of the router as to where that is located. Linksys routers are usually at http://192.168.1.1  Dlinks are usually http://192.168.0.1  you will need to enter the username and password for the administration.  Then go to wireless settings and turn on security and input a password.  It really is that easy!    If you post what type model and make of router we can give you more help. Or you can use the manufacturers website for the router like  http;//linksys.com  or  http://dlink.com  or http://2wire.com  you will find tutorials, help files, manuals etc for your router. But start with the NAME on the router.    Hope that helps - edit your question and add some details|`|83vhCGW1aa	You can do it yourself, and its not that hard.  There should be a manual that came with your router that tells you exactly how to do it. It will provide a few details that you need to get it done, but if you don't know them you can ask the manufacturer.  First, open a web browser (like Microsoft Internet Explorer, or Mozilla Firefox, etc) and input the IP (Internet Protocol) Address of your router. (This is one of the useful facts in the manual).  Normally this will be 192.168.something.something (192.168. signifies that it is on your local network, and the somethings are what you need to fill in.)  When you go to the page that opens up in your browser it will be all about your router, and you can go in and change the settings to add a network password.    If you are interested in advances in wireless internet, check out WiMax from clear.  It gets you high speed wireless internet thats not too pricey.  Unfortunately, its only in Portland, Oregon at the moment, but they are bringing it to other cities soon.  You can basically walk around anywhere in the metro area & have very fast internet access on a laptop.

d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	It will never recognise them and show the ink levels as full. There is nothing you can do as they are programmed to only recognised new cartridges.  Each cartridge has a chip in it and this tells the printer how much ink is left in it.  When it reaches a certain level it starts to issue the ink low warning.  If you refill that cartridge it will still register as empty as it does not measure how much physical ink is in it just how much it shown to have used.  The printer should still print by resetting it using the reset button when it tell you the ink is low and do you want to continue printer, just click yes. Both my Canon ones print with refill and for the one with multi cartridges I have a chip re-setter so that registers full the other is a two cartridge machine and the chips can not be reset so I have to reset it manual to ignore the ink low waring.  You have to keep and eye of the ink and as soon as the prints start to look faded refill or change the cartridge immediately.    This should help you understand how to reset it.  http://www.jettecrefill.com/search.asp?b...
zorYTX59aa	Contrary to popular myth, you don't "get paid" by just being a YouTube partner.  First, you need an "AdSense" account, and, believe it or not, most partners do  not have one. But even if you did, only in exceptional circumstances, if Google   places "certain" advertisements by your videos, do you "sometimes" get a few   pennies based on 1000s of views, or (more importantly) if people actually click   on the ads beside your videos. Another influential factor is your "channel views".   Do people just watch a couple of your videos, or do they go to your channel to  watch "You"? That is why channel views are so important. Just like regular TV,   advertisers pay the networks for their target audience and demographics. They   don't pay the TV show, nor individual episodes. After all, media buyers can not   possibly know the exact content of the next video a partner may come up with.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	depends. I heard it was .08 cents per view.|`|eQbIDhK2aa	no that isnt true

NiI2HrvFaa	If you have an account then just sign in and click the yellow button that says upload. Then give the video you want to upload a title and then browse through your computer and find the video file. It should upload in about 3-7 min according to your video size. And It Should show up on your page in about 15 min. And There You Have It. But if you don't have an account then you will need to sign up for one then do these steps. Hope This Helps!!!|`|46OYLEXWaa	Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|3wzCumkQaa	Well youtube offers a wide variety of compatible video formats.

GhpRIo9Aaa	Nah, as I know, Deviant art is a really free community, so they have somewhat loose rules (not completely loose, mind you, so you still have to respect authors rights and wishes)...you may use their art works for your desktop or similar, unless artist didn't said different (always check the comments under it), in which case it's rip off.  You even have button for download the stuff, but for that you should be registered (which is free, at least the basic account)  In some cases, images will have watermark and similar, which you can't and even if you could, shouldn't remove.  Yes, the print/payed version just provide you the best possible quality of the print, saying, good stuff for good money. But images, especially in the wallpapers section, are definitely for use.  Just don't use "downloaded" art online (submit, share or sell and similar) or change any art work without original artist permission and you're fine :)

Ev6WQRmzaa	No, that just means it has the hardware needed to connect to the internet wirelessly.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's the same kind of wireless connectivity any notebook or laptop would have. It's not some special wireless.    If you had a network you could connect to for free, it would be free on any device (iPhone, netbook, notebook, etc.). If you had a network you had to pay to connect to, it would be for-pay on any device (iPhone, netbook, notebook, etc.).    Nothing special about netbooks in this regard.|`|xdlsGvldaa	If you use and surf the Internet from home you will have to set up the service with a Internet Service Provider like AT&T or one of the many others.  To connect free go to any hotel, restaurant, library, coffee shop or place that has free Internet.  Hope this helps|`|wpeInOLzaa	I would really stay away from the "netbooks" unless you have a very specific need for ultra small size over functionality. With a netbook you usually get a VERY small hard drive which is usually between 8-64 GB whereas the standard is closer to 200-300 GB in notebooks. Also, you will only get 1 GB of ram, keep in mind windows 64 bit now supports up to 16 GIG in a regular laptop so you're really putting yourself in a potion where you have limited upgrade-ability there too. Another thing to consider is the lack of an "optical drive" in a netbook commonly known as a dvd/cd drive, this means you will not be able to install software unless you purchase it over the internet. (But remember you have a VERY small hard drive, so you're not going to be able to install many programs) Meanwhile your stuck with the far inferior "Atom" processor, which is the "brains" of your computer. Look for a good deal and you will be able to find a fully functional computer (laptop) for around $600 that will serve you for years. Also, if you're dead set on a netbook, check USER reviews for specific netbooks you're looking at on different electronic web sites like best buy.com, amazon, qvc.com ect. Many of the people who bought these netbooks are unhappy for one reason or another after they get it home and realize how small the screen is and how slow the processor is. I beleive, however, that HP is viewed as the best netbook over the Acer's, EEE's, and the others.

2eb3b10f915c12af5f46e8e87c404752aa	If on the old computers you have a retail copy of XP yes you can move the copy on another computer and re activate.You won't be able to use the old computer after that.If you have installed an OEM copy(if it came with the computer) you can't.OEM copies are tied to the original hardware.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The activation code, and the computer it's being used on, is stored on a database at Microsoft (that's what you do when you activate Windows - send Microsoft your activation key and a fingerprint of your computer.)  If you want to install it on another computer, you call Microsoft, they delete it, and you can register it again.  But only on 1 computer at a time.  (The serial [key] should be on a sticker on your computer, or on something, like a CD case, that came with it.)|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	No you can't do that, as those product keys are married to the computer they came with. You cannot install oem software onto another computer. And install pirated copy of windows would be illegal.    So you either need to by the windows xp operating system or contact the manufacture of the computer and have beem send you the oem cds for the computer, they will either be free or not more then 60 dollars.

E5mFWOqqaa	The Atom processor is newer, so it has more advanced technologies put into it. However, it's also optimized to maximize battery life: whereas your Craperon processor from 2001-2002 was likely once a mid-level or high-end processor on the market.    I remember seeing a test between a 1.2GHz VIA C7-M and a 1.6GHz Atom, and I think they were fairly even, and I think the 1.2GHz Celeron was compared with the Atom and the Celeron might have been slightly better.    I would say they're likely to be close enough to where the difference may or may not be noticeable.|`|9pUrLItjaa	The newer Intel Atom will work faster. Buy a netbook with 1GB of RAM too, not 512MB. Intel Celeron 900MHz is still used on the earlier netbooks like the Asus Eee PC 701.    Intel Atom was designed for machines like netbooks, essentially to put computing power in your back pocket. It's designed to be energy efficient and perform simple tasks - if you need a laptop for really demanding gaming or complex programs, either buy a dual core laptop or use a portable PC.    The Sony VAIO TT is essentially a scaled down dual core laptop - 11.1" screen, weighs about 1.3kg, still has an optical disc drive (that is your CD/DVD-ROM drive) unlike netbooks. You can find them easily in most computer stores or any Sony shop in the UK is likely to have one on display.    >>> http://www.mini-laptops-and-notebooks.co...    Hope this helps

You won't hurt your computer by trying though.
Kswn0Aqcaa	Yes. If you have a port for SD cards, that is good. You put your small chip into the bigger card that has an opening in it.

E5mFWOqqaa	You do know that Alienware is owned by Dell right?    The extra cost for the name isn't worth it. You're paying like $3000 plus extra for each upgrade for nothing but a Dell computer with a few changed graphics.    If you are going to spend $4500 on a laptop (why?) then you should look other than Alienware. Of two friends that have them, both have had to send in their laptop for repairs, and one's warranty ran out three days before his laptop malfunctioned.    It's just not worth it. You can spend $2000 on another brand of laptop, and you won't get the "superior" quality that Alienware (Dell) has. Plus, you'd have saved a bit of money.

I'm not sure if they are or not). These are more expensive than the manufacturer's recovery disks, though. Go to HP's website or call them and see if you can order the CD's from them instead.|`|lR1vbA1faa	I'm pretty sure your looking for system recovery. It will take your computer back to day 1. When you turn on the computer, you'll see it, you need to press like F-3 or something at the blue startup screen.   Also, you could try going to Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, System Restore. System restore will take your computer back before you got the viruses, without deleting any of the programs or documents you still want. They can still be on there, however, your computer will be able to do some of the things it could'nt before. So, you can go back, then download Spybot S&D and get rid of any trojans, worms, etc. Also, get either AVG or Avast to get rid of the virus. They are all VERY trustworthy and FREE programs. Anyway, best of luck.|`|PcmQCF03aa	I recently did this to my own computer    What i did was go to Start>Run>"Format C:"  and it worked out pretty well    it'll restore it to factory settings|`|D3eiZlySaa	Use any operating system disk as long as it is comparable.

AA10565336	It sounds like your system is similar to mine.    Click start    In the search window type "recovery disc"    It should give you a program option.  Select it and when it opens follow the instructions.  You want to do this right, I.E. all the way so have the materials you need before you actually start burning.  The hitch is, if your system is like mine, it will only allow you to burn one set.    Once you have the recovery disc boot to the first one and it's all down hill.  I would suggest you leave the recovery partition alone.  That is don't format it.  Just format the main partition and reinstall your software.    I've been where you are going.  I also accept email at my profile.  That's a formal invitation if you get into trouble.    Good luck and don't hesitate to write if you need me.|`|pA8lfKbJaa	If that is recovery.iso, you are supposed to burn a DVD from it and use the resulting DVD.

If the problem still happens, go the Crl+Alt+Del and under processes end the task. Search again, end every task that's utorrent, multiple ones can occur (the more you click utorrent, the more opens, even though normally it doesn't let you open more than one).    After you ended every utorrent, try again.    Otherwise, resort to the last option, reinstall utorrent.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:    1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6. Click "OK"|`|RZQnxoF1aa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/RegCom... learn how to fix it.|`|KlRo6JLQaa	Make sure that your network is secure.  You don't want people using your connection.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i think its either your computer has virus or the ram isnt enough|`|4m5RukbNaa	Simple answer would be Spyware, even if you havn't downloaded anything you can still get it on your system, and a lot of time Viruses do come with them. i would scan the heck out of the system with Spybot Search and destroy (free) and also malwarebytes (also free) you can find both on www.download.com. If you have the space and time i would also run Adaware on it and make sure to get all of them. That should help a whole lot.

OIC0vsEWaa	if you have it a 3 ghz already, then you getting a phenom wont really help. from what ive heard, the 9850s don't overclock as well as they should. and besides, with the new AM3 phenoms going to be released sometime soon, the price on the current Phenom II's will drop fast. which is good because they score around 3.8 ghz on air cooling. if you want a processor i would wait    i would go with the video card right now and crossfire two of them.    and congradulations!! you are the first person who asked a question of intelligent nature. most of the other stuff on here is just noobs asking things like if they can fit a video card in their dell.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Sounds like a CPU bottleneck. Try running Half Life 2 at 640x480 at minimum. If things still run horribly, your CPU is definitely choking and you might want to put your money towards a new Phenom.

Next run the chart wizard to build your graph, and put date as the horizontal axis.  If your dates were true dates instead of days of the week, I would recommend that you use scatter diagram, but since they are text then just use a traditional line or bar chart.
aSjdL4heaa	umm ... if you rip out the antenna then you can't use it wireless either.  Do you just want a hard-wired router instead of a wi fi access point?  Then why don't you just use a hard-wired router?    The only way to physically block your signal so that you could still use it would be to line the inside of your house with a couple of layers of highly conductive wire mesh and then ground the mesh.  It doesn't seem worth it, does it?  It really isn't that hard to password protect your signal.|`|wbzAkLCLaa	Sure-  Hard wire into it, and turn off wireless in the administration panel.    Otherwise, securing/passwording it.. is the only way.    You're asking if you can physically block wi-fi...  so my question is, how do you expect to connect wirelessly to it?    Doesn't make sense.|`|0GtonJONaa	yes there is you encrypt and password protect your wireless access. WPA is the lastest standard 128 bit encryption. If your router has OLD WEP standard 64 bit encryption, email the manufacturer, and see if you can get a firmware update, as I did with my D-Link and it was a free download, cheaper than a new router. "Tin foil hat" is a good one for "MythBusters" on cable TV lol. Type 192.168.0.1 in URL window of browser or 192.168.1.1 depending on make? hole next to power cord, press paper clip in there for 30 seconds takes it back to factory settings, where "admin" maybe username and "password" may be password?|`|1eiPSIydaa	Yeah sure.  Or submerge it in a bath full of honey.  that would work too :-)    Seriously. As the other person said just password it!|`|BZMPax7Naa	Use the security that is built into the router.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	i doubt it, why dont u just password protect it?    aluminum foil might boost the signal... but im just guessing|`|1fjXNY7Waa	Uh no. Try making your network secure. Make it invisible with a password and change the password on the router, so it is not "admin".|`|VSqk5zpnaa	Password protect. If I had wireless and lived in my own house I would not worry at all about who is using my wi-fi I do not care. But I used my next door neighbor's wifi once for a lan and their internet went out while we were still playing - ownt.    By the way... How would foil do anything? Seriously?
IuCT3TjGaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.

TM73kWZDaa	OK so first you need the "icon". For maximum browser compatibility, the icon should be in the standard Microsoft Windows Icon file format and saved as "favicon.ico". You can have multiple resolutions of the icon in that file; it is the browser that decides which one it has to display.    Next you need to place the icon in the root directory of your website. The file could be placed elsewhere but using root directory the general practice.    Finally you need to add the following two lines to all pages or atleast the default page of your website:          This ensures your icon is displayed by majority of browsers.|`|cILeS32iaa	That is call a favicon I think.    I do know how to change it in blogger, other than that I can't help.    Maybe you can google favicon and some might know how.      http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|doSFKebSaa	This is achieved by adding a link element to the  section of the document as detailed below. In this way any appropriately sized (1616 pixels or larger) image can be used and, although many still use the ICO format, other browsers (though notably not Microsoft's Internet Explorer) now also support the PNG and animated GIF image formats.

9ECwMzZXaa	Most laptops can take it if you drop them accidentally from a table or waist-height, so it shouldn't be a problem. I don't think you can burn your CD if it just like that, the laser is set on 'READ' mode (i think) so it should be just reading, not burning. Try the CD in other CD-Drives, try other CD's in your CD-Drive.

044IeGstaa	See this image off of your Newegg link?  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ShowImage....    See the middle adapter? The one, that has two White four pin Molex connectors, (Two connectors like this,http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnect... ), and they go through two Black wires, and one Yellow wire EACH, to the Black connector?    This is an adapter that converts Two-Molex 4-pin connectors into one 8-pin PCI Express power cable, http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnect...     Now see this view of the Sapphire graphics card?  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ShowImage....  At the top right you will see a Black connector. This is the side view of it. The adapter's Black 8-pin PCI Express power connector, plugs in here.    (EDIT: Just checked. It just goes back to the main page of views. Click on the third view from the left. This shows a side view of the Sapphire graphics card, and the connector)    All you need, is two unused 4-pin Molex connectors, from your power supply, to connect power. (AND YES, you need to use TWO! You CANNOT just use one Molex power cable! If you need to know why, email me)    Computers use three voltages.  A. 3.3 volts  B. 5 volts  C. 12 volts    Your power supply will have a label on it, stating the voltages in a chart.  Under each voltage heading is the Amperage. (Amps, or just printed as -> A. Example: 18A)    You will have to probably unplug your computer, and drop the power supply out. The chart MAY be on the side of the power supply, but most of the time it's on the top! (Fun stuff, huh? It's not that tough to drop the power supply, and look. It just looks tough at first)    NOW, very few power supply's that are 450 watts have a 30A 12v rail.  (30 Amp, 12 volt rail)    If it's a generic power supply, you can bet it doesn't. If it's a major brand power supply, the odds go up in your favor. Major brand being like Corsair, OCZ, and the like.    The 450 watt, and 30 Amp 12 volt rail rating, is based on a computer setup, the graphics card manufacturer has for a test system.    It is based on a real powerful, power hungry, computer system.  Usually a Quad Core processor, 4GB's of ram, powerful gamer motherboard, two optical drives, two harddrives, several case fans, and this graphics card.    You'll probably be alright, but without knowing what motherboard, processor, ram, case fans, AND power supply you have, I can't give you a positive answer.|`|zJppAVbVaa	It will run fine on a 450W PSU.  2x4 is the molex connector for external power to the GPU, the card will come with any necessary adapters you need for your PSU.  When you install the card in the pci-e bus, attach a 12V cable to the card as well or your PC won't boot - use an adapter that comes in the GPU box if needed.    The 30 amps on a 12V rail is just an overhead for PSU's that have efficiencies below 70% - the manufacturer just states it as a guideline.  A 450W PSU will supply enough power to all the devices in your PC on the 12V rail (HDDs, CD/DVD, Fans, GPU, MB, etc)...|`|6e493640b4ac78141e0378dfa50e5a8baa	To figure out your amps. Look on the side of your power supply. There should be a label and should list the different voltages.     Something like  +3.3V +5V +12V -12V +5V    You are aiming for the middle one. Make sure that has at least 30 amps, but to be safe, 32 amps.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	2x4 is a reference to standard 4-pin Molex. We've been using those since 1980's XT clone computers, and your power supply surely has some. If you need more, splitters are common. To check your rails, pop the case and read the chart on the side of your power supply. If it's the original five year old model, it may not have a 12v-centric distribution. Also, a power supply's comfortably sustainable output declines with age, so I'd play conservative unless it's a bulletproof power supply like a SeaSonic or high-end Delta (both use Japanese electrolytics that hold up to time and heat better).

It works well - Just google search "zillatube" to get it.    ==========================???|`|TbXz21fLaa	Copy right infringement or an out dated shock wave player.|`|FU6Lb5vKaa	It could be your internet connection, or the video that you're watching.

xJnD7of4aa	First thing:  I know how to do all this stuff, and no-one will hire me... how the hell did you get the job????    Second:  I'm not bitchy, so I'll try to help... in simple terms.    1.  Set up the server computer up first with Server 2003, set it as a domain controller.    2.  Configure it with an account name, make it a member of administrators, domain admins, etc.    3.  Since you seem happy re-installing xp on the 40 odd computers individually, do it.  When it asks about networks, select the Domain option, not workgroup. Enter the domain options that you set up on the server.    It will probably ask for a user account that has the privilege to add computers to the domain (that'll be yours)    4. For now, stick all computers in the same OU (Organisational Unit), it's in admin tools or something.    5. Change the Group policy for that OU, and get it to install the .MSI files of any software you want on all machines, this should save you some time, as it happens automatically.     That should get you started... I had a funny feeling I missed a small step with the server, but It's probably a question it asks at install anyway.    Whilst things are installing, I SERIOUSLY suggest you read some sort of quick guide to setting up a domain, because you will get serious issues that could take a lot of working around if you don't know what you are doing.|`|aqfFI0P5aa	Your best bet would be to setup a domain controller. That would give you the ability to have authentication and access control. Setting up a domain controller is no small deal though. You may want to consult a professional.

TLX3sW8eaa	I dont know what you mean by no image but my advice would be    System restore...i dont think virus's come back when you do it. Start...control panel...system restore.     Repair...Insert the cd you got with your pc and select repair in the options.    More details=more help.... if its just a problem with internet explorer then uninstall it and then re-install it....or use firefox.
