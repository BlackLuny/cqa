I've been cleaning my house, which is a pig sty, and I was ready to vacuum and the vacuum cleaner broke down on me... and I'm so frustrated.  I don't have the money to get it fixed or to replace it.  The attachments still work, but the main part won't "roll."        I'm sick and tired of living in a disgusting filthy house with gross crap in the carpets.        How else can I clean this nasty carpet?  An alternative solution to getting the vacuum cleaner fixed or replacing it??  I don't have much $$$$      Thanks!

It was a little bumpy, so I peeled off the paint on it, and there was greenish/black MOLD under it. So I then ripped all the chair rail off which left me with some gnarly sized holes in the wall. The reason for the holes in the wall is that the mold had biodegraded some parts that had gotten wet when someone had left the window open before the house was bought.       Which leaves me with the question will Sheetrock be able to patch up the large crevices?
