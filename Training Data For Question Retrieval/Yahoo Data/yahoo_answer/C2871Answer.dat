VecVZ15naa	Not particularly, but a serious lack of competition has made them successful (IMHO).|`|6thEIxtVaa	No way,but pup n taco went out of business and now we have only the second best. Much better to go to costco and have a hotdog there.|`|P1SfKSNBaa	Yes I love them I also miss their fries that yo would shake in the bag with a packet of seasoning.|`|oh9UPZ7Jaa	They're not bad.  For my taste, they're a little heavy on the ground up pig snouts and cow's lips.
WRoOZWcFaa	I have seen a few when I am out eating and I will share them with you.   1. Rubbing their nose or touching their face and not washing their hands before serving your food.   2.Touching or brushing their hair.   3. Not washing hands after going to the bathroom.   4. Putting their thumb in your glass when they are refilling it.   5. Dry crusted food on forks.   6 Tables not being washed down after being used before you.(This happens a lot at fast food places)   7. Hair down and in their face. This could case a fly away hair in your food.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Unrestrained long hair and wet floors.    And the people at the drive-up window handle money and food - that's just disgusting. |`|VvbOSbRnaa	One thing that bothers me is when servers bring the glass over and they hold it by the top of the cup. They need to hold it on the bottom, because hands near the top and sometimes lips go there or the straw. (I used to be a server and my trainer told me to make sure I do that, and I always did and now I notice when people don't!)    Servers that smoke 99% of the time never wash their hands when coming in from smoking. (It was so bad where I used to work, that I had to talk to a manager about it)    Servers not having their hair tied back if it is below their shoulders.|`|3ba92f492227f1c19665470daace0744aa	Not washing their hands after servicing/cleaning the restrooms.|`|YnNhr3eIaa	1. Dirty restrooms- I can only imagine if they dont take care of the restrooms what the kitchen would look like.  2. Refilling bottles of condiments-not sanitary  3. Putting cheep private label condiments on the tables  4. Salt & Pepper shakers that you cant get the product out of  5. Open doors and windows that let bugs in  6. bent forks and spoons  7. cheep knives that wont cut  8. stale lettuce on salads  9. serving cold drinks in glasses that just came out of the washer and are still hot.  10. unclean servers. stains on clothing, dirty hair, dirty fingernails.  |`|36nu3FPQaa	blowing your nose, coughing, without washing your hands    reusing tablecothes    eating, then not washing your hands    serving drinks on a tray, close to your face, meaning holding the tray high by their face    sweating,and dripping in food!    One time, we had a table walk out because the one waitress handled money and then went to wait on them. But it's hard when we have to do the cash register and waitress. Besides, we pick up tips too. There is no possible way to constantly wash hands. |`|F3NSePryaa	touching their hair seems to be a big one.|`|P1SfKSNBaa	Rodent droppings.|`|1mpnSoFtaa	-dirty dishes (water glasses especially, as well as plates!!)  -unclean and food crusted table tops (they dont use good cleaners, and obviously dont care sometimes!)  -water spills  -(in agreement with previous answerers)  -etc.  i hope i helped some.    please comment on my song lyrics, real quick. Thank you!  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|GyNchrUqaa	One of the absolute worse offenses is handling money and then touching the food. Money is one of the worst carriers of bacteria around. Think about how many hands your cash has been in before your servers.|`|dlyzK9ufaa	I don't know as far as what I have noticed, I have not eaten out in awhile, but I am a server so I can tell you a few big no-no's that may help and I am sure that they happen a lot.  Not washing hands after any of the following: handling money/credit cards, etc., using the bathroom, touching hair or face, bussing a table, anything trash related, using the phone, eating, running food, smoking. There are tons more I am leaving out. These are big ones,  Another thing that is gross is handling the top of glasses when serving them to a customer, touching silverware or food, not pre-bussing tables, handing out unwrapped straws...the list goes on!  Those are all food related, as far as service goes, I think that speed, efficiency and friendliness are the three most important things and are unfortunately among the most overlooked. You should just watch the server if you can and if they are doing their jobs right, they will almost always be washing their hands and then applying hand sanitizer immediately after.   Y'know, now that I think of it, I had a server once when I was a kid that was terrible! My dad and I went to eat and everytime she walked around the corner with food for a table, she would have something in her mouth and be chewing. At first I just thought it was gum until she came around the corner picking fries off a customers plate! Eww! Gross!   Good luck on your paper!

I love their food and the atmosphere. The servers, food runners and busers are always very pleasant and professional. I don't recall ever having a bad experience there. I have brought friends there who've said it is one of the best (if not the best) Mexican restaurant they have ever been to. I hope that you will add their name to the list of restaurant options in the Gaithersburg/Germantown area. ...ER <br>  <br>  NEW **** - Italian Pines - Lost Knife Rd Off Price Center - Gaithersburg, MD. - DINNER - March 7, 2008 <br>  <br>  Italian Pines offers excellent food at very reasonable prices! Friends of ours recommended the restaurant. We had passed by it on several occasions. Nothing fancy on the outside or on the inside, but wow, what a hidden gem! I dined on a generous order of Rockfish, simply done- superb (make sure you tell them you how you want your fish or it will come with head and all). My wife raved about the Eggplant Parmigiana and has now proclaimed it her favorite. Ceasar Salad was hearty as was our white bean soup, delicious! Our server was friendly and quick. Italian Pines was a great recommendation, what a pleasant surprise! We will definately go back. .... HD B<br>  <br>  <br>  NEW ****+ - Rustic Oven, Germantown, 18301 Leeman Farm Road, 8/16/08, dinner<br>  A good friend gave us a gift certificate to the Rustic Oven. What a fabulous surprice. The bread served to start is an incredible homemade foccacia served with basil infused oil. As an Appetizer we chose to split an Antipasto Rustico which is a combination of Calamari Fritti, Mozzarella Caprese and Bruschetta. The Calamari was just perfectly fried and the Bruschetta was just excellent. <br>  <br>  For entre' we both decided on a house special veal dish consisting of veal cutlets served with an incredible creamy mushroom sauce infused with Brandy. The chef certainly paid a lot of attention to get this sauce just right and she succeded to served a gem. We just could not resist having desert. My wife is a big Tiramisu fan and this one did not disapoint. I tried a fruit in light custard sauce. Fabulous!<br>  <br>  If you like Italian, the Rustic Oven is a MUST try. ...KRB <br>  <br>  NEW **** - MYTHOS Vasilis Grill - Gaithersburg - Snouffer School Rd - 3/29/08 - dinner<br>  We ate here for the first time (we had a coupon so decided to try it). Restaurant staff were all extremely warm and friendly and service was great!<br>  <br>  The food was excellent for a small neighborhood restaurant. The shrimp mythos had a delicious tomato sauce with just the right blend of wine and sweetness. Shrimp souvlaki was very tasty. Bought the karasomething or other dessert (almond butter cookies with powdered sugar) and they were yummy!<br>  <br>  What a refreshing surprise. Will definitely go back!! ...R&D F<br>  <br>  **** - Mangiare Bene, Gaithersburg - 808 W. Diamond Ave, 5/4/08 - dinner<br>  My Italy-born and raised mother and I (raised Italian) had dinner at Mangiare Bene on Sunday night. If you're looking for fancy nouvelle cuisine, this is not the place for you...but if you're looking for authetic, down to earth traditional Italian food like in the trattorias of Italy, you will love this place. The food was portions were generous and the taste was superb. We each ended up taking half of our meals home because we were so full...and even as left-overs, it was delicious. Our host, Roberto, had all the charm of typical Italy. Mom couldn't stop raving about how good and genuine the food was. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also inviting as a cozy place to dine with family and friends. Having grown up 'Italian' and having spent so much time in Italy, I love that I finally found a small slice of 'real Italy' here in Maryland. ... DS
