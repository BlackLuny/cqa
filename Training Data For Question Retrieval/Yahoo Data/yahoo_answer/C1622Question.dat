20090304152810AAxQ8TU	Travel;Mexico;Mexico City	Translation of summary?	May I have an english translation please? thanks a ton guys      Resumen de Un Cuentecillo Triste      Un cuentecillo triste de Gabriel Garcia Marquez es una lectura sobre un chico que esta muy aburrido los domingos y escribió en el periódico para encontrar una chica. Después de tres días, una chica le escribió y dijo que ella estaba muy aburrida en los domingos también. Entonces, el chico y la chica fueron a un café y tomaron limonada y helado. Durante la noche, los chicos no hablaron mucho y había silencio. Ellos estuvieron muy molestos así que ellos fueron a ver una película muy dramática. En la película, ellos no hablaron y el chico se durmió. Después de diez minutos, la chica se durmió también.   Después de leer la lectura de un cuentecillo triste, yo pienso que la chica es muy Buena para el chico. !Ellos tienen muchas similitudes, por ejemplo ellos no son habladores y también ellos están pesado en los domingos! En mi opinión, la lectura no es triste sino un poco cómica las personas en la historia son muy normales y sus vidas no son interesantes. Las personas hablan en el periódico y van a una café y película por la noche. Esa noche es aburrida y no es interesante. En conclusión, un cuentecillo triste de Grabriel Garcia Marquez es muy diferente pero también un poco tedioso y cómico.

20090305053115AABM8Jy	Travel;Asia Pacific;Thailand	Is is good description of Thailand? Did I cover the main points? What should I add or take out?	This is not my homework by the way. I am an adult..         The Kingdom of Thailand is an independent country in Southeast Asia. It is also the country's center of political, commercial, industrial and cultural activities. Thailand is the world's 51st-largest country with a surface area of approximately 513,000 km2, and the 20th most-populous country, with approximately 63 million people. About 75% of the population is ethnically Thais, 14% is of Chinese origin, and 3% is ethnically Malay,[3] the rest belong to minority groups including Mons, Khmers, and various hill tribes. The country's official language is Thai, and the currency is in baht. Thailand is one of the most devoutly Buddhist countries in the world. The national religion is Theravada Buddhism which is practiced by more than 95% of all Thais. Thailand is divided into 75 provinces      The region known as Thailand has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period, about 10,000 years ago.In Thailand they have certain cultures which it is very taboo for someone to do something that in other places is very natural. Such as touching someone's head or pointing with the feet. It is important when visiting Thailand you respect their way of life.       Physical demonstrations of affection in public are common between friends, but less so between lovers. An important holiday is the Thai New Year it’s celebrated from April 13 to 15 each year. The most popular team sport in Thailand is football (soccer). Traditionally funerals last for a week. The Culture of Thailand is heavily influenced by Buddhism. Thai cuisine is famous for the blending of four fundamental tastes: sweet, sour, spicy, and salty. It is accomplished by using a host of herbs, spices and fruit. Most of Thailand has a tropical wet and dry or savannah climate while the South and the eastern tip of the East have a tropical monsoon climate.       The history of Thailand begins with the migration of the Thais from their ancestral home in southern China into mainland Southeast Asia around the 10th century AD. Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. In Asia, only China, Japan and Thailand have never been colonized by European Power. So you still see primitive art and real Thai architecture in every city in Thailand, not the mixture of Thai and Western.      Tourism is a major economic factor in the Kingdom of Thailand, contributing an estimated 6.7% to Thailand's GDP. In 2006, Thailand was the 18th most visited country in the World Tourism rankings. Thailand offers a great variety of attractions. These include diving sites, sandy beaches, hundreds of tropical islands, varied night-life, archaeological sites, museums, hill tribes, exceptional flora and bird life, palaces and World Heritage sites.

20090305052758AA0BrnF	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	To What Extent Should Foreigners Participate in Dishonest Behavior and Corruption in the Philippines?	I was taught to be responsible and honestm and follow the law but in RP often the locals break the law and involve you in it. For example, taxi drivers suddenly ask you for P50-500 above the meter fare and if you refuse, they start a verbal fight with you. That is dishonesty and breaking the law, but if you do not follow what they say, an unpleasant incident ensues. Some tax drivers openly display Jesuses and hanging crosses but act so dishonestly in front of Jesus.    Sometimes, some people ask you for kickbacks and bribes but if you do not give a bribe, they may put obstacles in your way. That is not good behavior, but if you do not participate in it, you may not get what you want. Once at an airline counter they told me there were no seats available and asked for a bribe. What should I do? I need to be there at a certain time because people are waiting for me. So, if you are an honest, law abiding person, but these people force you to do dishonest and corrupt things and inconvenience you if you do not bribe and tip them. What should such foreigners do?

20090305080700AAJXxcI	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Why is Wisconsin so Unfriendly?	I've heard people from out of state say that this is the most unfriendly place they've ever been. I too have noticed that it is unfriendly here to a fairly large degree and I've lived here my whole life.. It's very hard to approach people you don't know and if you do, prepare to get shot down viciously. It's also been more difficult to meet women here for dating than I've experienced when I've been out of state. No there is nothing wrong with my approach, it works for me just about anywhere else and I've gotten numerous friends, and dates. But it just seems like you can't talk to someone here that you don't know, whether it's waiting in line at the store, at a ballgame, or a bar. People seem to have the mentality here that if they don't know you, they don't want to waste 5 seconds interacting with you unless it's flipping you off. Unfortunately I can't say that I've met many nice people that live here, unless of course they're born and raised in another place. Does anyone have any reason/explanation as to why?

20090305082920AALqkk9	Travel;France;Other - France	Canadian moving to France to visit my girlfriend (long distance relationship), questions and concerns.?	Okay, so my girlfriend is a French citizen, been living there her whole life. I've been living in Canada my whole life. Since I know people are going to ask this, yes, I have met her. And yes, I'm sure I'm ready for the move.      However, I have read a lot about expats being unable to find work there, and that's my biggest concern. My girlfriend does have a place of her own, but I really don't want to bum off of her; I'd like to be able to work and help her pay for rent, etcetera. Assuming I knew basic french, would It still be hard as heck to get a job there until I get my French citizenship (which takes 5 years..)? Is France a good place to work & live at? etc, if anyone with knowledge on the subject, or better yet, if anyone could share their experience, I would be very thankful.

20090305084837AAtOJzQ	Travel;Air Travel	Multi-stop, multi-airline flight.  Luggage questions.?	This summer I am flying (for the first time ever) to Argentina.  I purchased my tickets from Priceline and I'm going from Ohio to North Carolina to New York and then off to Argentina.  With the multi-stops I also have multiple airlines: US Airways, United, and Delta.  Now here are my questions.  In between flights, will my luggage automatically be transferred to my next flight(s) and just meet me in the final destination?  And with the charges and fees for checked luggage, how does that work out?  I'm going to Argentina for 6 weeks, so I'm going to need quite a few clothes and other things, so I'll probably need 2, maybe 3, suitcase/luggage.  I am also bringing my camera, laptop, glasses, contact lens case and solution on my carry-on.  But all my checked luggage, do I need to pay the fees for EACH bag for EACH airline since it is a multiple airline flight, or will it be a one-time payment each way (to Argentina, and then back home)?  And when are you expected to pay the checked bag fees?  The whole "checked baggage fee" thing confuses me.      Yes, this is a lot of questions but I've never flown before and I think I should probably know all of this before I leave.

I'm off to Vegas in just over three weeks and want to buy some new clothes to take with me.      Everyone I speak to says that I should wait until I get there and go clothes shopping in Vegas as I'll get loads of bargains.      I know what I want to buy, how much I want to spend and where to get them from (In the UK) but seeing I haven't been to the US for over 20 years then I don't know which shops to go to and where they are!!      Also, I'm on a budget so I can't afford anywhere near Versace suits and Armani jeans!      Therefore... could somebody please recommend somewhere in Vegas that I can get some half-decent clothes at cheap prices?      When I say cheap I mean under ￡100 ($140) for a suit, under ￡30 ($45) for a pair of jeans, under ￡50 ($70) for some trainers/sneakers      All answers gratefully recieved!!      Thanks....

People is scared of coming down here for vacation, I think unless you like to vacation on the border small towns and visit the drug lords houses they will be fine. We all are living a regular normal life. They ask all kind of questions and the put links to news sites but they don't actually read them, they just read 'drug war in Mexico' and automatically think there is chaos over here. Really, how small do you think Mexico is so if there's problems on one side there's war all over? People didn't stop going to California when 9/11 happened!

20090305092301AACpGjO	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Saudi Arabia	Did I do the right thing??? I Feel bad.?	Ok. so we found this guy who rents out indonesian maids for sr2000 a month. outageous I know, but we were desperate. We pay the man a week in advance and he brings the maid. She was ok, but not even 24 hours into her stay she tells me she wants me to take her to the police cos her Kafeel (the guy who gave her to us) rapes and beats her and doesnt give her any money. Now Im the first to admitt that these maids deserve oscars for their acting and lying but also admitt that there things do happen. She told me if I didnt take her she would run away to the police anyway and did not care if she was jailed but wanted to put an end to what this man was doing to her and her friends. I think ok fine, every personhas the right to go to the police. She said that if I take her to the police to tell the man she ran away and he would give me back my money. I said fine.     Well when she tells us the story later the same day many things changed. She no longer wanted to go to the police but to the mutawa family she worked for before me claiming they told her to run away to her house and they would take her to the plice. I call the mutawa and he said he never said that to her, that he just told her to go to the police. Then she wants to go to some place in qatif where her "Brother" lives and he would take her. She wasnt very concerned about the raping and beating just the money. I started thinking things were fishy and she was giving me crap. I got to the point where I didnt care where she went I wanted to just put her in a cab and get her out of my house. We called some authorities we know who advised us to just give her back to the kafeel and if she wants to run away she should runa way from him and not us. Sicne the mutawa told me it took him 2 days to get her to leave his house I did not want her making a scene in front of my kids so I lied and told her her cab was waiting when actuality I had called the kafeel and he was outside. She kept thanking me and I couldnt look her in the eye. Once she saw it was him she kept asking me why why why but I told her sorry and gave her some money. I feel very guilty but I dont want problems from her, and again, her story changed so much I felt she was lying.    And of course, even though she was in my house for less than a day, the man is not giving me my money back. he says inshallah and blows me off.    I feel like I backstabbed her. When i stand in front of God one day, will he hold this against me? Again if she just said police I would have taken her but the story kept changing..........

20090305102021AAb1SD7	Travel;United States;Other - United States	I Have to Take a Trip I Really Can't Afford.  HELP!!!?	My very good friend of many years has asked me to meet her and some friends to celebrate her birthday.  She wants all of us to meet in a city that is about a 5 hr drive from me.  I have been seriously struggling financially lately, but for various reasons (guilt, prior neglectfulness on my part, peer pressure) have decided that I have to make a showing at her party.  Its for a weekend only.  I will be splitting the gas with another person to get up there.  My friend who is having the birthday is supplying the hotel rooms (she gets discounted rates becuase of her work).  My burden will be my meals and any alcohol and cover charges in the places we go to celebrate.  Does anyone have any tips on ways that I can save money or keep from overspending without doing things which will embarass my fellow travelers?  I want to survive this, but I don't want to be bringing bag lunches to restaraunts or drinkiing the remnants of other people's dicarded martinis before tables get bussed.  HELP PLEASE!!!!
