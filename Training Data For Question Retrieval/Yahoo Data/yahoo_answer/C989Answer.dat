7o5FHem4aa	im 14 and i play volleyball and my coach has us do this for verticals..<br>  <br>  boxes. which is basically just jumping up onto a box that's about knee high without double hopping. and you want to go as fast as you can and do it as many times as you can.<br>  we also do repeaters. those are just lightly tapping your feet on top of something knee high. go as fast as you can on these to. and it helps to hold your hands behind your back, that way ur working ur legs more and not using ur arms to help you jump. so you end up jumping twice as high.<br>  and jumping down from stuff helps to. you use the same muscles to jump that you do when you catch yourself when you jump down. so you can jump off stuff and that helps.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	this can increase your vertical up to 12 inches called <a href="http://airalert.com/" rel="nofollow">http://airalert.com/</a><br>  also try program 51<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com/</a>

Donovan McNabb will have a 79.7 QB Rating, (on the Cardinals) Boldin will be released which hurts them. And Troy Polumalo (or however you spell it) with have a broken leg and won't play against the Patriots.
qUQnsqnsaa	I liked them both. Edge/Christian are a great Tag Team and I would like to see them Tag Team one more time in the WWE!|`|b7JS16dyaa	It's funny, because I actually made the first titantron. From a viewer standpoint, I'd say it's pretty good. I screwed up on cutting some of the Christian clips though, you can see traces of other clips in it if you pause just right. =P<br>  <br>  As for the second one, there actually wasn't enough cropping of the clips, which means there wasn't that much work put into it. It's just Edge and Christian's titantrons merged together with very long parts of each guy. Looks nice enough though; if you can't remember what their titantrons look like, you would think it's awesome.|`|k8YSuKGpaa	Both are good tributes.

fWL2Q7Geaa	On the replay, it's clear that Kobe pushed Chris Paul away with his right arm and then flopped for the referees. The referees bought it and fouled out Chris Paul. It's tiring to see how the NBA referees cave in to home crowds and consistently make favorable calls for superstars like Kobe, LeBron and the rest. The wrong call and it cost the game.|`|nBqZBbtnaa	The refs make bad calls, some went the Hornets' way some went the Lakers' way. If it was lopsided in any teams favor then you can complain.

Sometimes the judges just call wrongly.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Wasn't a foul on Paul, it wa son Kobe and it would have been Hornets ball. Paul wouldn;t have tripped Kobe if he didn;t fell after the push. Posey's shots were bad for the Hornets.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	When the ball is loose on the floor like and the foul is obvious I wish the refs would  swallow there whistles.

CttL3LmBaa	Bob A is very correct in answering the question as asked.<br>  <br>  rlbjr rambles about his 25 years and former too much. <br>  <br>  I have been riding for over 40 years and one thing has stayed the same -- simple -- go to your local bike shop and find out what size frame you need.  Period.  It is that easy an answer.  From stating your height and weight no one can tell you what size bike you need.  Your inseam and reach are the most important, and it varies from person to person of the same height.  I am 6'0" and quite comfortable on a 57 cm bike of most makes, some are 56 cm.  So it even is a variable between bike brands.<br>  <br>  Please do yourself a favor and go to the bike shop.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You go buy inseam size rather then height.  Here is how to take the measurements and figure it out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit" rel="nofollow">http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit</a>|`|E70A7aqcaa	As a former AVID bicyclist for around 25 years, I can tell you that "Bob A" is partially correct.  It's the inseam measurement that you need to consider when buying a bicycle, but it's often spoken in terms of inches, as you ask.  Please let me advise you on buying a bicycle since I have so much experience buying and riding them.<br>  <br>  I don't know what your budget is, but, for ya'll's sake, do NOT buy one from WalMart, KMart, Target and the likes.  Go to a REAL bicycle shop and get measured for an exact fit / height of a bicycle, and buy one that isn't one of those "two-wheeled-tanks" as I call bikes bought at stores of the likes of those I've named.  It will make a HUGE difference in how much you ride  your bikes, and how happy you are with them, and, many bicycle shops have their own riding clubs which are full of very fun people at all stages of bicycling experience, and they can be a LOT of fun, as was my experience with the club I belonged to in Athens, Texas.  The rides are leisurely, and we often met for club meetings, followed up by a club "eat-out" at our favorite pizza parlor, and at times we'd put together one of those events where everyone brings a dish of their favorite food over to one of the club members' house, and we'd have more fun just sitting around talking and bragging, and eating, etc., after a fun ride.  And if you really get into bicycling, you can eat all the food you want because bicycling will burn calories galore, and keep you trim and fit as well.  Now, you and your boyfriend may not have had such social experiences with your bicycling in mind, but, I HAVE to say that you need to go to a REAL bicycle shop and get properly fitted for a good bike so you'll really enjoy bicycling.  I've ridden tens of thousands of miles over the years, in going to and from work and school, and in leisurely riding alone and in group / club rides and in massive rides that drew thousands of participants, and in races.  I hope whatever your need is, someone fits you right for a bicycle, and it won't happen at WalMart, Target, KMart, or the likes.  You'll love a good , REAL, bicycle shop.  God Bless you both.

LeJ6Uu3raa	well if the only problem is that you cant keep your legs straight, then imagine you're going to kick up into a handstand when you start the cartwheel with you hands over your head, then turn when your hands are almost about to hit the ground. it is important to push off the ground with your hands powerfully and kick your legs over fast. keep your arms as straight as possible so that your legs can come down straight. you should end up facing the opposite way with the foot that started out in front now in back. it's basically the easiest move in the world. <br>  <br>  check out some youtube vids just type in "cartwheel tutorial."<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JpXiKJ8Aaa	I don't know how you can't do it, it's simple ive done it since I was like 4.

And I think word of the legend-bashing in this section got back to Vince.<br>  <br>  So Vince took the opportunity to put those complaints on the air.  Chris Jericho isn't bashing the legends himself (he's a wrestler, too; he doesn't agree with the complaints), he's just voicing the bashing that ignorant fans do.  And Vince gave Roddy Piper the chance to address those complaints, also on the air.  Piper did an awesome job with his heartfelt, pain-filled "shoot".

Even when he was sidelined with an injury, he would show up at the games and coach his team mates and try to get them to play better. The problem is not Bosh's lack of leadership/passion...it is his team mates who often let him down during games.<br>  <br>  Though, I agree he can be soft sometimes...when it comes to his defense (the whole team in general is soft defensively).
be8c12cdca22b46ac7dcd7d626901063aa	I have same problem , Kukkiwon become to be Olympic sparing orientated . <br>  Tae Kwon Do is an ART , martial art . And should be martial art . <br>  Olympic sparring is a part of training not a primary rule .<br>  My recommendation, get 4 Dan , become sabumnim , open your own place , school etc . and teach whatever you want .<br>  If you want to get your 3 dan in other style like Tangsoo I think you must pass all required tests , knowledge , physical and mental maturity and theoretical knowledge as well .<br>  Is not easy to switch styles .<br>  I know that from my life , not many masters accept previous  certificates even received from grand masters known in the World .<br>  Kukkiwon needs yous money , maybe you will be lucky get you 3rd Dan in other style .<br>  Good luck|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	A third degree is not a high dan rank. It is a low middle rank at best. I commend you on realizing that TKD is not going the proper direction and that will never change since they are mostly in it for the money more than anything else. The Kukkiwon is full of corruption and problems and has always been that way.<br>  <br>  Moo Duk Kwan is simply one of the many kwan that makes TKD what it is. It can also be seen as Tang Soo Do but it differs quite a bit from Tae Kwon Do in both forms and what they teach. Tang Soo Do resembles Shotokan Karate more closely than TKD. <br>  <br>  I am sure that Moo Duk Kwan group would require you to retest since they do not do the same forms and their requirements are quit different than TKD. As for testing for your fourth I think you should take some time and rethink your purpose in the arts. If you want to be an instructor you need to focus on learning to teach more than rank. Rank will come in time. If I were you I would find a good Tang Soo Do school and enroll so I could be taught correctly if that is what I wanted to teach. Good luck.
Im5QQdTEaa	No.  It will only look like they have gotten better.  But that's because a couple of teams, Missouri and Kansas St., lost key offensive personnel.

qnxH8bOlaa	Nope
Z8UV6S3baa	Depending on what you ultimately want to use the rifle for, a .22LR bolt action, like a CZ452, or a Ruger 77/22 are nice, moderate cost platforms that you can put a full size scope on to learn how to use. Shooting a .22LR at 100 - 150 yards you can learn plenty about adjusting for windage and drop as well as learning the fundamentals of shooting a rifle accurately. The great thing about this is .22LR ammo can be $15 for 500 which will last you all day in a bolt action.<br>  <br>  If what you are looking for is a platform that you can "accessorize", then in a .22 that means a Ruger 10/22. Easily the most accessorized .22LR platform on the planet and for under $400 you can start with a bull barrel version that will shoot under 2 MOA with a decent ammo and possibly better with well tuned match ammo. In centerfire, you are looking at a military platform - AR is probably the most popular right now, but there are other good ones - the Springfield SOCOM versions of the M1A are great weapons with accessory rails and such. In an AR the typical caliber is .223, in the M1A .308. If all you are doing is shooting at paper, the .308 probably gives an additional 300 yards of potential accurate range over the AR, but the ammo is more expensive. <br>  <br>  AK platforms generally are not accurate enough to do anything with much refinement regarding scope work. There are a number of other older military rifles which are available and not terribly expensive that you can learn on - 1903 Enfield, an early Mauser, etc. These can be restocked and accessorized, but that takes some more work. For some it is well worth it.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|H4dswqRlaa	One minute of angle accuracy is very close to one inch at 100 yards. That extended to 200 yards would be 2 inches, and so onward. Varminters speak of one minute of Woodchuck. I would suggest getting a 243, which frankly is the best varminting rifle there is, with the 25-06 being a close second, but a bit too large for extended shooting times. You can take deer dependably with the 243 using premium bullets, when you work up to that. The hot 22 centerfires suffer from wind deflection at extended ranges, from my experience, but their almost total lack of recoil aids in shooter accuracy, so there's the tradeoff, and a 243 has very little felt recoil. Many feel that the 243 is the perfect sniper rifle.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	10/22 with  scope, cheap to shoot, fun and great for learning. $200 new in CA|`|TvARYVRJaa	um a sniper,,,, 6.5 mm ,,bolt action  accc, scope  bi pod  ,practice ,,,, and adj trigger  ok thanks|`|0WTfwVvXaa	browning A bolt this gun is absolutly fantastic only $800 too look into it|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Learn how to shoot accurately. Buy some books on target shooting. Find a shooting class in your area and take it. Buy a good bolt action .22 Long Rifle chambered rifle. Put a good scope on it then plan on spending a several dozen hours sending a couple thousand rounds downrange learning. Then you upgrade to a well built centerfire and spend even more time and ammunition learning how to shoot at long range. You really don't need any accessories beyond a good sling and maybe a bi-pod. It will be less expensive overall if you start reloading. Again buy several manuals & take a NRA certified class if you can find one nearby, before you even buy the press & other gear & start reloading<br>  <br>  Expect to spend around $6-800 plus just to get an accurate .22 rifle and scope. A serious precision centerfire rifle and scope will be a grand or probably more. <br>  <br>  Start saving money now. <br>  <br>  You'll do better if you do a bit of light weight lifting and aerobic exercise to build your strength and endurance.|`|DXV0A1haaa	I'll disagree with a lot of these guys telling you to dump cash on an expensive rifle.  I have a Savage bolt-action .17HMR that I use for cutting paper (target shooting) out to 200 yards with a cheap but decent decent 6-9X50 scope.  The whole rig cost me just a touch under $200, and with a table and sandbags I can keep 5-shot groups under 3 inches up to about 200 yards.  With my old plinking rifle (.22LR) I'd be lucky to get 5 in a row on paper at 200, scoped or not, unless the wind was dead calm.  I'm by no means a great shot, either - that .17 HMR rifle strapped into my gun vice cuts under an inch at 100 yards (scope zeroing) often with at least 3 holes overlapping.  <br>  <br>  The .17HMR is by far the most enjoyable round I have ever come across for target shooting - it's fast, flat, and realtively inexpensive to shoot.  There is no recoil to speak of, and the sound is inoffensive and even pleasant, and unlike .22's it doesn't leave much residue in the rifle. I wouldn't try to pop anything much bigger than a large rodent with it, just because of the chance of an inhumane death (walk-off).  I used to blaze away with my .22 to plink, and haul out my old Enfield for "serious" shots.  Now, I rarely use either one - the .17 can make any ranged shots the Enfield could, out farther than my eyes can handle - on paper or small clays, anyway.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Get a rifle chambered in .223.......

pE5E5L5naa	alright i got ya, so he's basically someone you hate alot.  I know you haven't grown up yet buddy, don't sweat it, this type of thing is common in young men.  I think this will help though.  He seems to be a big talker.  If the guy talks alot does he has buddies to back him up? even if you kick the snot outta him, your gonna get in hell afterwards if he has some really good pals.  If he doesn't, he could always start some $hit up like call the cops on you.  I don't think its worth it.  But hold up for a second,..now if he's the one claiming that you can't beat him, it may be a good idea to train hard, and then try to lure him into punching you first.  Then you would be considered the good guy, then you can pound the living crap outta him.  As for training, buddy, you don't need martial arts.  Heres the rule of thumb for winning.<br>  1.fire<br>  2.power<br>  3.martial arts<br>  <br>  The confidence you get from being fired up...that force is unstoppable man.

AA10232540	I've been making and restoring knives for the better part of 25 years and I have to say, I have yet to see a real "leather-wrapped" grip on a knife.  What most folks refer to as "leather-wrapped" is in fact stacked leather made up of a dozen or so leather disks.<br>  <br>  Tell your hubby to head to Ebay and look for "tooling leather" and get about a square foot or so.  It's not expensive.  He'll then have to use one of the original spacers (leather disks) as a pattern and hand cut each one with an Xacto knife.  Just cut the inside to match the old leather or the knife....leave the outside rough shaped.  Once he has them stacked thick enough, use a Dremel or a sanding block to shape the outsides of the disks down.  use finer and finer grits just like if you were doing wood and finish with some wax.|`|AA11694178	The simplest thing is to go to  www.texasknife.com.  They have everything anyone needs to make a knife or a knife handle.  You can also do a Google search for Tandy Leather.  They have both stores and mail order.  I don't know exactly what you mean when you say a leather "wrapped" handle.  Seldom, if ever, are knife handles leather "wrapped".  More than likely, he wants to make a leather handle for his knife.  These are traditionally made using stacked thick leather washers.  The washers are stacked on the handle and tightly fastened in place with a nut to compress them.  They are then rasped and sanded to the desired shape.  So, with this in mind, you may be able to buy scrap shoe sole leather from your local shoe repair shop.  Your husband can cut washers from the scraps to make a fine handle.  The scraps should be very inexpensive or if you are in luck, they might just be free since he was just going to throw them away anyway.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Find the nearest Tandy Leather / The Leather Factory store.  I believe you can find a listing of store locations at the Tandy website.<br>  <br>  Anyway, find the nearest store and give them a call.  if Tandy does not have such a kit, the store manager can probably help you by supplying punched leather washers for your husband to fit over the tang of the knife and he can probably tell you how the leather should be treated for best longevity.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Doc|`|Z8UV6S3baa	There is actually a whole underground world of people that are involved in knife finishing where they buy blade blanks and put guards, handles and alot of other ornamentation on them. Two of the best known suppliers of material for those as well as the full knife maker are Jantz Knifemaker Supply, and Texas Knife Maker Supply. I've listed the websites in the source area.<br>  <br>  Also, you may want to head to your local library to see if they have back copies of Blade Magazine which has a section in it devoted to something having to do with knife making in each edition, as well as take a look at Wayne Goddard's book - "Wayne Goddard's $50 Knife Shop", as well as Bob Loveless' book "How to Make Knives". Both are good references for the part having to do with putting a handle on a blade.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade
Vs2rihU6aa	Gloss paint will probably look nicer, but keep in mind that it also shows flaws (dents in the frame, uneven surface, drips).<br>  <br>  I'd use one can of each of the same brand in this order:<br>  - primer<br>  - paint<br>  - clearcoat  <-- this will help protect the paint<br>  <br>  Read the instructions that come with the paint regarding how long to wait between coats.
TeNIStN1aa	You can't get too much for that gun and I think you are probably aware of that already. Many shops will not take your gun. Even if they do, they will not give you much for it. One of the best options is to put the gun on consignment and split the invoice price with the shop or haggle hard to get the most out of it. You will probably get $40 to $45 this way. Another option is to wait and take advantage of those "gun buy backs" programs. Many times, you will get more than what your gun's worth. Also, I would sell the holster separately. You could dump them online rather easily.<br>  <br>  Of course you could try to sell the gun to private parties. But, just think about all the possibilities before and after the gun was sold. In my opinion, it's not worth the trouble.<br>  <br>  PS: I am definitely not giving you smart comments even though they  might sound like it. I am just offering you smart solutions with my limited brain power.|`|zkzDLcznaa	15 to 25.00 tops|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	judging from the wording of your question you must already be aware of the diminutive value of the J22<br>  i am not trying to insult you but i would not buy one for $25 if offered to me.<br>  they hold little value and even less reliability so you cannot expect to get much out of it.
hoZxIQkkaa	Nash for sure. For sting I think it would be good if they came up with some story line where he is a commissioner of some kind. Steiner a talent agent works well for him, but he might encourage roids. Angle is a great heel but causes locker room problems in real life. Although Angle does his job getting people to hate him.|`|SRoBNj0naa	No they should put Nash in as an anouncer, after surgery on his elbow he may never wrestle again, and he is getting to old. Booker T and Stiner should team up and beat BeerMoney for the tag team belts, Angle should leave and try his hand at something else, but not UFC, he would get hurt really bad. And sting should stay as TNA World Champ.|`|spfGFHBQaa	Booker T isnt nothing anymore. and angle should come back to wwe where he belongs and stainer could be the talent agent. tna isnt nothing but the backbone of wwe superstars who were fired|`|AA11780757	I rarely watch TNA, but I think they should only fire Kurt Angle if he would return to WWE.|`|6WF9BMp8aa	they should keep main event mafia and fire kurt|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Then they would lose the only Main eventers they have|`|5WttD4V5aa	maybe Booker and nash thing.

I thought the allstar celeb game was the best.

Compare last yr (26th of 30, 81.7%) with this yr (19 of 30, 88%)<br>  <br>  Management simply views Brooklyn as bigger and perhaps hope the area could cling to the Nets like teh Dodgers.

But if someone said it was a nice place to visit and would consider moving there, I'd assume they are either on acid or are blowing sunshine up my Sean Avery.<br>  <br>  As for the Nets, who knows what they're thinking. If the Brooklynites hold their stance and refuse to fund an arena, then the Nets will either work out a deal with the Devils or relocate to another city.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	im not even going to answer you Q. because i have no idea.<br>  but basketball is a crappy sport that is boring to watch and is only slightly fun to play i you know what youre doing. that being said i think basketball has no comparison to hockey. and if you dont care about hockey then dont ask hockey people about it.|`|BXRQqK5qaa	Are the nets still owned by 'YankeeNets'. That would explain a lot.<br>  I'm a huge Devils fan and would go to every game if I could afford it, and have never had any problems. If the Nets don't want t go there, it's their loss.|`|hz8YjsJPaa	THIS IS HOCKEY|`|KyCJOR2paa	10 years ago I would have said why the eff would you want to go to New Jersey... then I had the chance to go there and to my surprise it wasn't just a big parking lot like I always envisioned.  I really thought is was quite nice.  That being said, you shouldn't care about the Nets.  You have the Devils and be proud of that.  Basketball isn't nearly as exciting as hockey.  Hockey is insanely fast,physical, and full of finesse, and it flows much better than basketball.  As far as I'm concerned the only part of a basketball game that is worth watching is the last 2 minutes.  Even then it will take about 30 minutes to finish the last 2 minutes... snore.  I guess basketball would be more enjoyable if a big mascot fell through the hoop at every game, now that would make basketball more enjoyable.

ABoo1doVaa	Hardaway was good, but no where near the skill level of Magic Johnson. I can't think of any basketball players off the top of my head that belong in this discussion. As for Sanders, he was great, and is listed as the best football player by some. He certainly would have set the record if he played a few more years. Griffey would have been amazing without the injuries, so I say both guys could have been the best in their sport.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Wrong section...<br>  <br>  Barry with roids and denies it even though it's obvious.<br>  <br>  Ken Griffey Jr. could obviously have more HRs than Sanders if it wasn't for the injuries.<br>  <br>  I'd go with Griffey.|`|AA11401901	sanders, no doubt..<br>  liberalism is a mental disorder.|`|uU9aCPB4aa	Id go with barry sanders and lol @ rich hes talkin about Barry BONDS LOL|`|GDl3QEZnaa	Griffey no doubt
n2yaCx3vaa	I never really got to see barry sanders play but i would have to say Griffy junior had a more disappointing career. He was fast and because of injuries his speed decreased and he didn't get as many stolen bases as he could and his fielding went down. Leg problems and arms problems also effected his hitting and i think he would have hit more homers than hank aaron and bonds. Probably in the 770 range. But from what i've heard of sanders it's disappointing he retired so early because i was still pretty young, like 10 or so and i only really watched the eagles. But i'm sure he'd be the all time leading rusher in the NFL and the greatest running back to play the game. Overall both excellant atheletes with good careers but disappointing.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Ken Griffey was considered the best player in baseball in his prime.  That was after Barry was in his prime.  Barry didn't become as good as he was until the late 90's when he started juicing.  Junior has never been accused of using roids.  Jr. 100%|`|WjZPIVRIaa	They both had an equal shot. Griffey has accomplished more than sanders did.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Ken Griffey had the more disappointing career.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I think Barry had the better shot at being "greatest ever."  Running backs are a special breed...QBs are judged by their team's record and number of rings...WRs are judged by TDs and rings.  For RBs it's all about the total yardage, and had he not retired early, I think Barry would have shattered the record by a "Cal Ripken" margin. And honestly the "bad team" worked to his advantage because they'd just hand him the ball 20-30 times a game no matter what.<br>  <br>  Even if Griffey stayed healthy (and that's a big "if") he would have spent the mid-90s overshadowed by Sosa and Big Mac and been overshadowed by Bonds and A-Rod from the late 90s onward.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Barry Sanders.  He would have shattered every rushing record had he played for, oh, six more years.<br>  <br>  Griffey would have come close to records if he weren't hurt, but I think he would have finished with, say, 725 homers or so, which would be less than Bonds and Aaron.|`|AA12040384	Barry Sanders are you foreal what about Brett Favre? i mean hes better than you, your mother and anyone that you have known, currently know, or will ever know.I mean hes amazing!<br>  <br>  Anyway,Griffey.He's fun to watch,sweetest swing I've seen,and just an all-around phenomenal player.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I think Barry left football too early & I say he would have shattered the rushing record & if Griffey Jr didn't miss so many games due to injuries, I say he would be over 700 hr's right now|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	griffey
qsWk3Fo6aa	He could win 20 games and have 200 k's with a ERA under 3.00, but it will be hard since his line-up sucks.

fC64C0diaa	I have a Taurus 85 that my Mom gave me when she got a new carry gun. I like it fine but don't use it much as I also have a Smith & Wesson 642 that I like a LOT better. The Smith is much easier for me to shoot (even though it weighs 6 ounces less than the Taurus). The Taurus is a fine gun and a good choice for a carry weapon. If possible try to shoot both the Taurus and a Smith 642 or 442 (which are basically the same with different finishes) before you decide to purchase one.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	I rented a Taurus Model 85 some years ago.  It provided a satisfactory experience.  No muss, no fuss, just 'business as usual'.<br>  <br>  They're worth owning.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	Yes it is. I have a 605, basically the 85 in .357 Magnum. It is reliable, decently accurate and very well made for the cost.

The certification course she mentions is the Hawaiian certification course. Hawaii is the only state that requires a state certification.  Most any surf school in Hawaii can tell you how to get certified but it is very hard and they keep the number of certified instructors way down.  Except on the North Shore, there aren't a lot of certified instructors who don't teach for a licensed surf school in Hawaii.<br>  <br>  In many US coastline cities, and some state parks, you now need to be NSSIA or Surfing USA certified to obtain a license or to get insurance.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many cities don't require any certification at all and there are a huge number of people teaching that don't have proper training and shouldn't be allowed to teach. The NSSIA is the most formal certification in the US plus is accepted and used by many school districts for their coaching certification.  NSSIA is also recognized by the IRS as the official non-profit surf school industry organization.

3VJHJChLaa	I don't cheer, but i am a gymnast. To get your jumps higher, you have to work on the muscles in your legs. A few exercises for legs you might want to try are, sitting up against the wall with you legs bent at a 90 degree angle with your hands on you head and hold for 1-2 minute intervals. Squat jumps are also good, bend down in a squat and jump straight up. Probably start with sets of 15-20 and get higher. Also, strengthening your calfs would be helpful. Stand on the stairs with your heels hanging off the end and life up on to tip toes and go back down. You can do them on each foot and with feet together, sets of 15 and eventually sets of 50. Honestly, this might sound stupid but practice jumping straight up and down pushing off and pointing your toes. Pushing and pointing helps soooo much with my jumps. To get your toe-touches better, strech your straddle ALOT. Make it as big as you can on the floor, and reach to the middle. Maybe even have someone push you down (sometimes i put my homework far away and have to reach to get to it). Streching your middle split helps and sitting up against the wall in a straddle and have someone push you into the wall. Making your legs stronger, streching and practicing will help a lot. It wont get better over night, but after a few weeks of training, you should see improvment. If you want more leg exercises, search for them on the internet. 17 magazine website has some fun exercises for legs to do with a friend. Have fun and good luck!
6vzpHTqQaa	New Jersey Nets - With Carter and Harris, anything is possible<br>  <br>  Minnesota T'Wolves - If Jefferson were healthy, they'd finish strong.  They've got a good core with Jefferson, Foye, Gomes, and Telfair<br>  <br>  Oklahoma City Thunder - Kevin Durant is a five-tool player, and he's got a decent supporting cast led by Jeff Green<br>  <br>  I would say Golden State, too, but 1) I can only pick three and 2) they don't play defense|`|GqyOCMwtaa	1- New Jersey<br>  2- New York<br>  3- Golden State|`|ljITAValaa	cool
MgVKy8CUaa	Whether it's the Predators or not, there should be teams in Winnipeg and Quebec City.  I want nothing more than to see the Predators work in Nashville.  It's the only way hockey can grow in non-traditional markets long term if the fans are willing to support and show interest.  But if the Predators are going to be moved to a market where people don't care, absolutely, get Quebec and Winnipeg back in the game.  Teams should be there.  Hockey has a long tradition in both and they did work.<br>  <br>  But this is where the NHL is failing miserably, and has been all along when trying to grow hockey in the U.S.  Put teams where it makes sense and the game can become stable.  There are a lot of options for hockey to work in the U.S. - Seattle, Portland, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Salt Lake, Cleveland (again), Cincinnati, Kansas City (again)... and there are more.  Why waste money in Phoenix or Nashville when you could build rivalries between Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland and the western teams where people know what a puck looks like.<br>  <br>  I'm still on the fence about Hamilton because I can't see how you could put a team there without it somehow hurting either the Leafs or Senators.  Hamilton would invariably take away from one.  <br>  <br>  I miss watching the Montreal vs Quebec showdowns.  So, yeah... If the Preds can't survive, revive the Nordiques and/or Jets.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Winnipeg does not have the corporate sponsor dollars, and Quebec's tax situation make both dead.<br>  <br>  Southern Ontario...probably your best bet.<br>  <br>  Windsor has an OHL team.<br>  <br>  Nashville can't just be moved on a whim.  There are procedures, protocols, and contracts that must be honoured before anything can happen.  Making the case that it would be more profitable and do better financially in Southern Ontario is a no-brainer, but you can't just say "this would be better" and Bob's yer uncle.|`|jVIbzqYkaa	I LOVE THEM!!!<br>  lol they should move to b.c....|`|IZ4GcYgiaa	I don't live in Canada and I want see more NHL teams there. Sad to say there is a likelihood of only Toronto and Montreal having NHL teams remaining.<br>  Based upon the exchange rate a team in the USA can make more money when they don't sellout vs Canada teams that do sellout.<br>  <br>  Most cities in Canada would lack certain things for maintaining an NHL team : An arena set up by NHL standards, corporate sponsorship for example.<br>  Southern Ontario would be Ideal but there is 1 problem : Any NHL team that relocates with 50 miles of another NHL team would have to pay that team through the nose based on the NHL terrtortorial rights rule.<br>  Both Buffalo and Toronto would bleed a team in Hamilton into bankruptcy if relocation did happen.<br>  <br>  Its the same 50 mile rule that is the reason why you don't see other NHL teams in Cities like Millwalkee.<br>  <br>  Places like Las Vegas are likely to get an NHL team first.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	the Winnipeg Arena got demolished a few years ago I thought? Would they be able to find a new arena or build an arena to place them in? Quebec already has the Canadiens I dont think they need another NHL team|`|AA11674745	Personally, I don't care if Canada gets one more team, or loses another. But I don't think we should be quick to suggest that those in Nashville don't like or appreciate hockey because of it's lack of history.<br>  <br>  History is made with a team in that city. You can't make history without a team. And fans ain't going to fill the arena from opening night on through the entire season. It takes time to sell a sport where it isn't native to the region.<br>  <br>  If it's so easy to suggest that any old city lose their team so that Winnipeg, Quebec City, Hamilton, or even Toronto gets a team, then why not have the Oilers, Flames, or Canucks move there?<br>  <br>  See what I mean?<br>  <br>  ADD: If people try to justify a return to cities where teams have left - at the expense of teams where hockey is being played for the first time, then that's just perpetuating failure.<br>  <br>  Winnipeg and Quebec City had teams, in part, because a new league (WHA) was formed to compete with the NHL. Both the Jets and Nordiques were established in 1972 and were mainstays for a circuit that was struggling to stay afloat. Then, after being absorbed by the NHL, it turned out that more revenue was available in Phoenix and Denver, respectively. <br>  <br>  To me, it makes more sense to leave the Predators where they are. Since someone has suggested a return even to Kansas City and Cleveland, then which team should be uprooted to return the NHL to Nashville in the future?|`|X1yZOMYHaa	Yes of course. I'd be surprised if any Canadian answered no. That they wouldn't want the preds. You don't turn down the chance to have a franchise because this years team isn't the greatest.<br>  <br>  It bothers me that Bettman won't let it happen. You have Jim Balsillie, blackberry billionaire, desperately wanting to put a failed franchise in a market where it's sure to succeed.<br>  <br>  The NHL is run by incompetents. I can't for the life of me understand why Bettman is still the commissioner. Hamilton is the best place. There are territorial issues with the Leafs to work out, but it could be done if Bettman was just willing to admit a mistake.|`|KyCJOR2paa	I think they should move to Wisconsin.  That would keep the same Central Division rivalries.  Would be even better Detroit/Chicago/Minnesota rivalries.<br>  <br>  A Minnesota/Wisconsin rivarly would be awesome.|`|etErp8rcaa	Absolutely. You want the team to stay afloat, and we in Canada are always happy to have more teams up here. Though I think the best hockey market without a team is still southern Ontario.|`|j17vl3Nwaa	Move them to Halifax.|`|BrWVhd9naa	I think phoenix should go to winnepeg|`|MnMkgAscaa	I wish they would move... I am sick of southern teams like Nashville and Atlanta and phoenix etc.|`|hz8YjsJPaa	tht will be good|`|l8ozbxpWaa	they are not moving ok|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	Actually Hamilton isn't the ideal place, the ideal place is Kitchener. Hamilton falls within territorial distance of both Buffalo and Toronto, while Kitchener/Cambridge falls exactly 1 km outside of the range. Jim Ballsille owns tonnes and tonnes of land that lies right there 1 km outside of the territory rights area, so he wouldn't have to pay special fees to Toronto or Buffalo. It's also right off of the major highway and only a short drive to the Toronto airport. On a game night, it would be faster to get to the Toronto airport from his plot of land than it would be from the Toronto arena (ACC) because of traffic and the roads involved in the trip.<br>  <br>  Kitchener also happens to lie right in that ideal radius for hockey fans in London that are starved for hockey. It just so happens that there are more hockey fans within a 90 minute drive of Kitchener than any other spot on the planet. Moreso than even Toronto because Toronto is in that radius but, Toronto's own radius doesn't cover cities such as London.<br>  <br>  Most of the hockey players through the history of the NHL have come from that same 90 minute drive radius.<br>  <br>  The jr hockey teams in Kitchener and London routinely sellout their buildings and have fans travel across the province to see them play because tickets are so scarce, these crowds are limited only by the sizes of the arenas and tend to rival and surpass many of those found at NHL games for a lot of Southern teams. <br>  <br>  An "Anonymous" donor (Ballsille) has stepped up and offered to help Kitchener build an NHL callibre arena for their jr team since they need the extra capacity to fit all of the rabidly mad hockey fans in.<br>  <br>  Why would the NHL want a team where people are begging for one when they can keep forcing teams where nobody gives a flying fig about the sport?|`|ZC2lYx8zaa	move the team to saskatoon i know it seems small for an nhl team but look at the saskatchewan roughriders they sell out and have a huge amount of support saskatchewans rocks woot wooo<br>  <br>  the united states has to much hockey teams and the fans are boring to watch
i94ZEqh9aa	Please. They are not going to lose to Delaware State. If they do, dickrod should be fired on the spot. Their non-conference home loss in 2009 will come to Notre Dame. I think the Fighting irish will win that game 30-18<br>  <br>  Go Blue!|`|ABoo1doVaa	None. I really don't think Michigan will tolerate losing anymore. I see them winning 9 or 10 games next year. That is if their new QBs are as advertised. If anyone will knock them off in the non con, it will be ND.|`|z6pdWKa5aa	I say none. But if they have to lose one of those, I would say Western Michigan. They beat Illinois last season, they can play with the big dogs.|`|A3JuXq8taa	Norte Dame has the best chance I believe<br>  <br>  that is one good thing about Oklahoma they always win their home games....of course they can't win a BCS bowl game to save their life..sigh....|`|GDl3QEZnaa	Notre Dame is sooo kicking Michigans butts this year!!!!!!!!!!<br>  GO IRISH!!!!|`|wEYIYevKaa	None, because we finally have some good recruits and we will win a lot more games.<br>  <br>  <br>  GO BLUE!!!!!!!!!!!|`|7RziqsDcaa	Notre Dame definately.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Smart odds would be to pick ND but WMU is a decent team.

With no rule restrictions, Shamrock would just wear down Gracie with punches and headbutts from the top, using his superior weight to make Gracie work harder.  He has the knowledge to stay out of subs when in guard, unless Royce really switched up his game and tried some Rubber Guard stuff.  And under modern MMA rules, Ken would do the same thing, except with restarts he'd be able to use his superior stand-up striking and takedown skills to rack up points.  He might even get a TKO or cut stoppage out of it.  And Gracie would be deprived of his one advantage: his gi.  That's the only thing that ever gave Shamrock problems in their previous matches.|`|LaBxzWa7aa	Honestly, MMA surpassed Royce Gracie, all he's done was submit fighters that didn't know what submissions were.|`|9b5QUw2eaa	No rules (without biting): Royce Gracie with a triangle after 3 1/2 hours.

i94ZEqh9aa	First off, let me make it clear that this anylisis is subject to change, as the new year just started. So without further adu, here's what I think Michigan is looknig at on offense, defense, and special teams in 2009: <br>  <br>  OFFENSE <br>  <br>  -Michigan returns all 11 starters on offense, and the only key senior they lose is tight end Mike Massey (considering Massey had exactly 0 catches while substituting for Kevin Koger all season, the loss of Massey means nothing). Now whenever you return all 11 starters on offense, thats got to count for something. So by virtue of returnnig everybody, Michigans offense will be improved next season. However, Michigan will only be "improved" in the literal sense of the word. They were dead last in the Big ten in scoring offense, total offense, and passing offense, and they were 7th in the Big ten in rushing offense (nationaly, they were 97th, 111th, 108th respectively, and 60th respectively). With everybody returnnig, and with a potential scrambler (Tate Forcier) starting at QB, Michigans offense will be better. They'll go from 97th in scoring offense to, say, 67th. They'll go from 111th in total offense to, like, 71st. They'll go from 108th in passing offense, to maybe, 78th. And they'll go from 60th in rushing offense, to possibly, 30th. Is that improvment? yeah. is it a good offense? HELL NO!!!! Michigan's offense will be medicore next season, and thats assuming shitty players like Martavious odoms and Darryl Stonum lose their jobs. if we keep all 11 staretrs and don't try anybody new (like Justin Feagin at slot receiver or Junior Hemnigway at outside receiver), our offense will remain horrible in 2009. Either way, its totally unrealistic to expect our offense to go from horrible to explsoive in one season. Case in point: Notre Dame. Is the Fighting irish offense improved from 2007? yeah. is it any good? No. Michigans offense will follow the same path in 2009: it'll be better, but it won't be good by any stretch of the imagination. Those who think our offesne will take off should Forcier-a scrambler who is "ideal" for the spread option offense-start next season are delusional. Forcier will be true freshmen, and he will likely struggle and go through big time growing pains just like Threet did this season and Ryan Mallet did last season. He will not save our offense IF he ends up starting (although i certainly expect to see flashes of brilliance). Forcier needs to gain experience before he becomes the really good QB we all expect him to be. <br>  <br>  DEFENSE <br>  <br>  As if our offense was bad enough, our defense was even worse. Despite returnnig 7 of 11 staretrs from a unit that was ranked 24th in total defense and 23rd in scorig defense, michigans D was abominable in 2008. It was the worst in school hisotry (thats not my opinion either, its a fact backed up by the stats). we gave up 29 points per game......more then we've ever given up in our 129 years of football. We were 90th in scoring defense, 66th in total defense, 51st in rush defense, and 87th in pass defense. Going into 2009, we return only 5 of 11 starters (one of them is Stevie pointshaving Brown), and Shafer is mercifully gone. I think Greg Robinson was a good hire, but then again, I thought Shafer was a good hire as well. We'll see what happens. Right now, Brandon Graham pretty much is the entire defense. I'm hoping a few other playmakers step up as well. I think Obi Ezeh and Donovan Warren should bounce back from dissapointing sophomore campaigns. Michigan's defense might not be good in 09, but it definitely shouldn't be the trainwreck it was in 08 <br>  <br>  SPECIAL TEAMS <br>  <br>  we still have no PR's or KR's (Odoms and Cisskoko are fumblnig machines, so they won't cut it), and now Lopata graduates, so we have issues at kicker as well. But hey, at least we have Mesko back!!!!!! <br>  <br>  So here's the summary of what Michigan is looknig at going into 2009: a slightly improved offense, a slightly improved defense, and bad special teams. Combined with an easy schedule that features 8 home games, Michigan should go 6-6 in 2009 and make the Motor City Bowl|`|YdGtwBxMaa	Im not sure about 7-8 wins but Rich Rod better do good or Ann Arbor will throw a riot and try to get him fired.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	A bowl berth would be fine.|`|A3JuXq8taa	they'll play in a little bowl game|`|U3KAgO0baa	Not Great but they are starting 2 get players that fit their system...<br>  They will have a tru freshamn QB, he will need tyme 2 develop...<br>  But Big Blue Has a nice future, under Rich Rod...<br>  <br>  I cant wait 2 play as Michigan On NCAA Football 2010...|`|NJw7T9nRaa	6-6 bowl game!|`|7RziqsDcaa	Well you will lose to Notre Dame again, that's for sure.|`|KTp27Fokaa	They aren't gonna be ranked again as long as Rich Rodriguez is the coach...

z7JsVzcnaa	Sit down with the kid and set down the ground rules about his behavior.  Make it clear to him that his behavior in these other school events will directly effect his ability to play football the next season.  He gets thrown out of a basketball game for being too rowdy, he doesn't play a game.  He may try to test you, but if football is really important to him, he should quit acting up.  It may take a a few times, but hopefully, he'll get the message.<br>  <br>  Also might want to involve his parents as well just so they know what's going on as well.  Hopefully, they'll be willing to back you up on this.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	If you want to have any control over your players and make sure they don't do stupid crap that'll prevent them from playing, or succeeding, or whatever you need to put your foot down right now with this kid.

Y4mz8BShaa	The Super 9 is a low quality, low accuracy, moderate FPS, loud, cheap excuse for a good quality bolt action.<br>  <br>  The UTG L96 (Only spring one I'd advise buying. If you're looking at the DE or Well, stop.) has amazing stock range and FPS. Accuracy isn't that great, and it's difficult to upgrade, which is why it's commonly left stock.<br>  <br>  If you're just starting, when I'm assuming, do NOT buy a bolt action. Sniping is nothing like it's portrayed in in media. If you don't want a "gut that sucks", and you want a bolt action, plan on upgrading. The UTG L96 and JG BAR 10 are two of the best stock spring bolt actions on the market, but it's difficult to compete with them without modifications.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend picking up a JG BAR 10 instead. It's the cheapest quality bolt action you can find, and one of the best on the market, even without upgrades.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=2761" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=2493" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=4435" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...</a>

Z9WVDGDcaa	The VS2 has the pressure regulation in the ASA.  Sounds like that's not adjusted properly.<br>  <br>  There's a hex screw on the ASA between the on/off knob and where the tank screws in.  Key: turn counter-clockwise to increase pressure and clockwise to decrease pressure. Follow these steps to adjust.  With no hopper/paint and aired up, turn the marker on and disable the eyes.  Fire the marker.  Turn about 1/2 turn counter-clockwise and fire again.  Check the gauge.  Repeat this until your gauge starts reading a pressure value.  Switch to 1/4 turn as you approach 200-225psi on the gauge.  As always for safety, you  should wear eye protection.  Once you have 200-225psi, you'll need a chrono to adjust velocity using the hex adjustment behind the bolt.
KMASS2Gmaa	4. Sniper is a job not a gun. I have shot all the rest including an M79 and an M203 grenade launcher. My favorite of all to shoot is the light machine gun. Specifically the M60 E version. I love it. Then the grenade launchers.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	For me:<br>  <br>  Pistols first - they are convenient to pack and still provide challenge at indoor gun range distances when it is cold and wet out. Further, there is more variety in how you can shoot, one hand, two hand, from the draw, from the bench, etc. Ultimately, I just like them better.<br>  <br>  Rifles second - I'm a plinker by nature so give me a carbine, reactive targets and a multitarget course and I'm a happy camper. I have as much fun making a soda can jump up a hill at 50 yards with a .22 as I am doing about anything else.<br>  <br>  Next, Bolt action/sniper - essentially I am combining these. Whether scoped or open sight, this is where you are taking long or tough shots and playing the "one shot one kill" game in your mind. To do it well takes a tremendous amount of concentration and is greatly satisfying to, "pip the ace at 900 yards" as one movie shooter put it. This kind of shooting can be done with a .22 at 100 yards, or .50 BMG at 1,500 yards. Ultimately it is about reaching out as far as you can and hitting something small. To be honest, I don't do that much of this. I find it satisfying when I am shooting well, but don't have the discipline to get as good as I would like.<br>  <br>  As for the rest? Well for me they are novelties. I've never got the chance to shoot a "heavy machine gun", but have shot a few full auto pistol caliber carbines and machine pistols. What I enjoy about shooting is the precision and the focus involved in shooting and I can't find that with any of these. I'm just not that much of a "smoke and fire " sort of shooter I guess.  Perhaps if ammo were cheaper, and these were more accessible so I could do it enough to actually get good with an MP5 in full auto I might have more fun. As far as a grenade goes - I've never thrown one. I'd like to give it a try, but again, not being as interested in the smoke and fire component it isn't a big deal to me. <br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|XNpnK4vpaa	It depends upon what I'm hunting.|`|M6fzLJtmaa	First off i live in CA, so that limits the list to number 1,2,3 and 4. however i do live close to NV and have shot there so here it is.<br>   5 or 6 a few of my buddies have some fun semi and fully auto's, ak-47, Ar-15, Uzi. they are big and fun. I would love to throw a few grenades around as well,(when i was a teen i use to play around with dynamite) and it was a blast. I shooting pistols are fun and powerful feeling, i like .45 or .40. I have a .22 rifle that i take shooting all the time its a blast adn cheap to shoot. A sniper rifle would be fun, however you are so damm far away. I would say lastly would be bolt action, because it's too slow unless you are going hunting.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	i would choose a rifle- and you can get a bolt-action rifle anyways- it's just the action type <br>  <br>  <br>  with a rifle, it's more versatile than a machine gun or a sniper gun or a grenade- if it came down to it- you could use a rifle for protection and hunting so you can survive- can you do that with a grenade or a machine gun or a sniper gun? deff. no with the first two i said, and probably not with a sniper because of the caliber of the gun.<br>  <br>  and if it came down to it- you want a sturdy, reliable gun, and i don't think that a machine gun could do that, same with a sniper and grenade- when you shoot/kill something you still want to have some integrity to it- you don't want it all mangled up- out of respect for what you shot|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	depends on what im shooting.

Oh yeah, I also carry a legal 12 Gauge Mossburg 500 w/an 18" short bbl and pistol grip in my car loaded with #3 Buckshot 3" Magnum rounds just in case of Emergency.|`|AA11622061	Pistols because it is more challenging to hit a target with those than it would be with a rifle. I've always thought that rifles other than .22's or .17's were for hunting and should be used for hunting because the ammo is pretty expensive. With pistols, you have a little more variety in terms of calibers and their ammo costs. anything under $20 for ammo is good, and a .22 is great because you can get 500 rounds of ammo for about $20.|`|AA11640949	I'll shoot anything with a trigger!  However, the main consideration for me right now is cost of ammo.  So, I'm leaning towards the .22 in a semi auto.<br>  <br>  However, it's been said (I don't know the author) that only accurate guns are interesting.  With few exceptions, I agree with that statement completely.  Usually, bolt rifles are the most accurate, but even semis can be made to be accurate.|`|GmRscBkPaa	I would prefer to have a full auto smg of some type, if I could.<br>  <br>  But I usually use a pistol.  It's challenging.  Works on a smaller scale range.  Ammo a little cheaper.

You can win it back to back, but I think I heard somewhere that they really don't want someone to be MVP for longer than 2 years straight. That means you can be MVP twice in a row but after that third year they want to switch it up, mainly for fans and just to spice things up. <br>  <br>  That's why Jordan never won more than twice in a row. Same goes for Nash's twice in a row and Tim Duncan back in 01 and 02 I think it was.|`|TYGG6ih0aa	That is not true. If you have a good enough season then the NBA will acknowledge that and give you what you deserve. But LeBron is doing so well this season that i think nobody is even close to his numbers.

SkN2NqpGaa	3Rivers Archery is a good place to get bows and arrows (they actually have a section just for the SCA archer!), but there are other places. Ask the other archers in the SCA group where they get their equipment.<br>  <br>  I got started with an old Bear recurve I found at a flea-market, with inexpensive wood-shaft arrows from Nirk Archery. If good wood-shafted arrows are too expensive for you right now (a set of good-quality wood arrows costs around $60 to $80 a dozen), some SCA groups do allow the use of aluminum shafts until you can obtain a set of wood arrows (Easton makes some really nice looking fake-wood shafting).<br>  <br>  You can save money by building your own arrows. The last dozen arrows I put together (about three years ago) cost about $50, total, and 2/3 of the cost was for the pre-dowelled shafting. Obviously, even more money can be saved by making your own shafting......<br>  <br>  p.s., Wood-shafted arrows can be used with any bow, it doesn't have to be a recurve or longbow. And you can use a fiber-glass bow until you can afford another bow. It is better to learn on a low-poundage bow (less than 35-lb draw weight), anyway.|`|ZKikquiOaa	Try www.3riversarchery.com, they also sell the wooden arrows.  Although the local SCA group went to home depot one time and bought tons of dowels just for kicks.

Basically, all you need is to be big, able to take hits, and literally run on your toes.<br>  <br>  Being big helps absorb the tackles, and when you can run on your toes, you can choose which direction to choose and avoid huge tackles from huge guys.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I'm sure we both have many areas to improve, as I'm still only a teen! :p

He is the greatest to have ever picked up a round orange ball.

LhC6UBWXaa	It all depends on what kind you are doing I will list a few and rate them in my opinion....<br>  <br>  Indoor Top Rope in a gym ----- Not very dangerous if you have someone belaying you that at least has some idea on how to belay<br>  <br>  Indoor Lead Climbing in a gym ---- a little more dangerous where communication is a little more important between you and your partner and you can also get hurt a little easier if you fall because there is much less tension in your rope then in Top Rope<br>  <br>  Outdoor Lead Climbing ----- There are routes for beginners but usually outdoor can be the most dangerous of the three because of the elements around you.  If you are outdoor climbing communication is the key to your safety between you and the person belaying you ie..(letting them know when you have a hard move coming up and preparing them for your potential fall)<br>  <br>  Overall I have not had any injuries requiring medical attention but you will get scraped up from time to time but a great sport to get into.<br>  <br>  Also if you are worried about dangers with the equipment the regulations on the harness's and ropes are very strict and that aspect of climbing is very safe but is good to switch up every year or so just be be on the safe side|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	The most dangerous part of rock climbing is the drive in your car to get there.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	its not dangerous at all, except if you fall!

AWHVwtIkaa	Shut down for a little bit. Rest it for a few days and see if it feels better. <br>  <br>  It's natural to be a little sore after playing, but "hurting terribly" as you put it isn't normal as I'm sure you know. So I'd give it a few days and see if the pain goes away on its own. If not, I'd definitely go to the doctor! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gSmrE8scaa	hmm, try amputation.|`|O8thhKSgaa	play first base|`|pWz8d8MBaa	just make sure to rest it, try not to use it out of softball and dont work it to hard during  practice just tell ur coach ur arms really sore, it will probably heal soon on its own and if it doesnt and pain gets worse go to a docter or take a few days of softball off,, in the mean time you can give ur body all the things it needs to heal quickly, eat some vit. c found in juices and eat many fruits and veggies for other vitiamins ur body needs to heal also eat some meat to help re build the the muscle trying to be formed. and remeber if it hurts to bad its not going to kill you to miss a few days of softball.<br>  good luck!|`|Uh7HagITaa	go to the Dominican Republic and get some premobolin, oh wait apparently you cant get it there either. i guess you could just call Arods cousing he will hook you up|`|CtwEFHcqaa	I think maybe you should go to a doctor.

7RziqsDcaa	Authentic ones are just like the ones the players wear on-field. The letters are sewn and the quality is best. They are like $229, though.<br>  <br>  Replica jerseys are just a copy of the jersey. The letters are not sewn/stitched, so they tend to fall off in the long run. They are usually $50-$60, but reebok ones are about $79.99, while Wal-mart ones are around $15-$20. Again, they both sell replica jerseys except the Wal-mart, K-mart, etc. ones are less in quality than the reeboks, fansedge, etc. ones. <br>  <br>  If you really want an authentic jersey cheap, get it from jersey101.com. They're like $30-$40, but they're shipped from China and the letters are sewn on.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	just because a jersey is sewn does NOT make it authentic or real.  If you wanna learn about jerseys or start into collecting them, its important to educate yourself an not let people fool you.  The Authentic will run you ATLEAST $100.  Check out www.nextleveltalk.com   Here is some info for you in the meantime on how to determind fakes from real jerseys.  Word to the wise............90% of the jerseys on Ebay are fake, sewn, with tags and the Reebok logo means NOTHING. <br>  <br>  What to Look For in a FAKE<br>  <br>  Alright…first you have to stop and think to yourself what the sellers of fake jerseys are trying to do. They’re trying to make money of uneducated buyers – which after eagerly reading this post…none of you are now! So…don’t fall for their smoke and mirrors…know the score.<br>  <br>  1.Picture Consistency/Inconsistency: The proof is in the pictures I always say (well sometimes I say it’s in the pudding too…mmmm….pudding) Watch out for sellers that take their pics on wooden floors…sometimes this does serve as a nice little backdrop and I don’t mean to discriminate against all sellers that take their pictures this way…but if you see wood floors…a jersey that claims to be authentic for $40 and some negatives in the feedback profile stating that the jersey the buyer bought was fake…stay away. ALSO, if you ask for more detailed pics of the numbers/name or tagging and the seller DOES NOT send you any…why do you think that is? Almost seems like they have something to hide doesn’t it? Maybe it’s because they do!<br>  <br>  2.Tagging: I STRONGLY caution you to BE CAREFUL when buying jerseys based upon tagging. Because it changes so frequently and it’s not that hard to get a blank jersey and attribute it with inferior quality materials…HOWEVER, it is still important to study the tagging of a jersey YOU KNOW to be authentic and compare it against a jersey you’re suspect of…it can sometimes help to eliminate it. But please, don’t base your decision solely on that…oftentimes you can miss out on a good deal just because Reebok likes to switch it up every year or two. I can, however, tell you that at NO TIME in M&N’s history did they have a larger Rectangle tag with just the NFL logo on it…you see that…eliminate the jersey right away. I’d also be skeptical of an “authentic” with the NFLPA hang tag…I don’t think they’ve been as prevalent in the last couple of years…I know none of the reebok authentics I’ve purchased the last two years have had them.<br>  <br>  3.The Key – The key is in the numbers…especially for football jerseys. If the numbers are wrinkled looking and appear to be flimsy…don’t do it man! If they have the appearance of cardboard…you should be all set. But don’t be silly either. If you have a Packers Jersey and you know it’s single layer tackle twill and it’s a little creased or wrinkled…don’t flip out and eliminate it right away…that jersey is more prone to wrinkle/creasing than a Pats jersey that has 2 other layers of twill to help support it. When in doubt…ask for closer/more detailed pics or rely more on the sellers reputation and the types of products they carry.<br>  <br>  4.Know Your Stuff – Educate yourself by knowing the different attributes of different teams jerseys…things that make them unique based upon examples you KNOW to be authentic…like the tight cuffs of a Packers jersey or the different textured twill of the Raiders and Panthers…all of this information can help you in your quest to not get ripped off. Also factoring into this is being a realist…if someone has a Ladanian Tomlinson Powder Blue jersey in a popular size (48, 50, 52) for $60…something stinks. The man is having an incredible year and the jersey is sold out on NFL.com, Eastbay.com etc…what makes you think anyone is going to be selling backstock in that for $70? It would be nice…but it’s probably not going to happen…if it does…you’ll hear about it here I’m sure. ; ) Finally, try to educate yourself and know which jerseys are heavily counterfeited…If you see a seller with a full size run of a popular player…something is up. Steer clear – even serious legit sellers like FRSVEGAS with serious bank roll can’t even get full size runs most of the time.<br>  <br>  5.Common Sense and Ask Questions: Again, use your head and know when something is too good to be true, often times it is. And if you’re ever unsure…ask questions if it’s a seller we haven’t mentioned here…everyone in this community has a lot of experience and knowledge to pull from that might not have been slapped on this post. Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions of the seller…if they’re serious about moving the item they’ll cater to your needs and answer your questions in as much detail as possible…I know I do.<br>  <br>  Resources to Increase Knowledge:<br>  It’s important to continue to keep expanding your knowledge if you’re serious…I continue to learn more all the time and, again, BY NO MEANS do I have all the answers. But as you can see, I’ve done a lot of work since I became stupidly serious about this two years or so a|`|NIPH3Gy7aa	All depends on what your looking for and how much you have to spend really.

3cd675f8a0783955763670d5ea211808aa	False. The only think I agree with you on is Sabathia. Yes, he had a heavy workload last season, and it will be interesting to see how he holds up this season. Do you really know how ridiculous you sound when you write "lefties don't do well at Yankee Stadium"?? The Yankees have always preferred lefties to pitch in Yankee Stadium, most of the great Yankee pitchers have been left-handed. With the big left field, lefties have a HUGE advantage over right-handed hitters there. The New Stadium has the same measurements by the way. <br>  <br>  They lost Abreu and Giambi, so what? Abreu's power has decreased since his Philly days, and he is best suited to play DH now. He is a very good player, but his best years are behind him. The Yankees are better just by getting rid of Giambi, even if they didn't add anyone. Yes, he hit over 30 HR and had over 90 RBi,  but he hit only .247, is a liability in the field, and struck out almost 100 times. He can't run a lick, and clogs the bases for other players.  If Giambi is not hitting the ball out of the park, he is worthless. Power is his only asset, and he sure doesn't help his infielders around first base.  Abreu and Giambi are one-dimensional players, and are both DHs. Nady, and Texeira are younger, more complete players. I don't understand your thinking here. Of course two players are going to produce more runs than one, you should have only included Giambi in the Texeira comparison. Nady will be more valuable than Abreu was last year.<br>  <br>  Obviously, you didn't see much of Pudge Rodriguez after he joined the Yankees last season. He had THREE RBIs, in almost 100 ABs. As weak a hitter as Molina is, we preferred him to the washed-up Ivan Rodriguez. Even if Posada isn't 100%, he will still be better than Pudge. He was a disaster.<br>  <br>  Ramirez ( a guy who originally belonged to the Yankees) is hardly a sure thing. He had a very good last year for KC, but in '07, his ERA was over 8.00. Saito is a good pitcher, but he's also 39 years old. Smoltz is not going to be in the bullpen. He is supposed to join the rotation in June. Don't sell the Yankees bullpen short. Rivera has much better overall stats than Papelbon last season, Phil Coke, a hard-throwing lefty, was dominant the final month after he came up from Triple-A. Brian Bruney is only 27 and had a great year after he came back from his foot injury, and Damaso Marte will be a Yankee for the full season. The guy made Ortiz look foolish last season. As for Price, he is going to be a starter for the Rays. Starting over a full season is a lot different than coming up in September, where players haven't had a chance to see him yet. He will have to pitch over 6-7 innings instead of just rearing back and pitching over an inning or two.<br>  <br>  They do not plan on sending Nady and or Swisher to the Nationals. They have talked about trading one or the other because they have too many outfielders, but they will not trade them just for the sake of trading them. Brian Cashman has said he won't trade one or the other until they get equal value or someone blows them away. At this point, Swisher will be a reserve (how's that for a part of your bench?)<br>  <br>  You also neglected to mention that Robinson Cano should bounce back to being a .300 hitter with his annual 40 doubles, 20 HR 100 RBI, which he almost reached on '07.  That improves the Yankees from last year too. Burrell is a strikeout machine. Good pitching will get him out. I don't see how he fits in with the Rays  athletic offense.<br>  <br>  As nuts as this sounds, I think that the Yankees will rally around A-Rod this year. They are stuck with him, and they will do their best for him.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	they dont have chemistry|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I agree.  I've been saying all along that I don't think they're even going to make the playoffs.  You come up with some very vaild points, and I'm curious to see if they really live up to all the hype they've been getting, I dont think they will.<br>  <br>  Also, the whole A-Roid thing hasn't fully played out yet.  Not only will it be a distraction, but A-Roid could actually face suspension now due to his involvement with banned trainer Angel Presinal.|`|yk4S7uuraa	1) This whole A-Rod episode will take too much away from the "team" and it'll hurt Joe Girardi more than anyone, because he'll get fired early.<br>  <br>  2) Sabathia has no heart, and will not "hold up" when the booing starts in Yankee Stadium, and it will, it always does.<br>  <br>  3) for the first time, they have more competition in their division, the Red Sox, Rays, and even the Orioles can start to give them problems.<br>  <br>  They're not a lock,and very well could finish third.|`|A5p9g4tMaa	Yankees are the 09 champs all the haters make me laugh if some of the other owners had the balls to spend money and field a good team every year with the exception of the Redsoxs. Then the league would be better.

Huh?     Lefties love Yankee Stadium because they neutralize the advantage that lefty hitters get with the short porch in right.  This is why David Wells, a lefty fly ball pitcher, had his best years with the Yanks - he had such a cavernous left field to work with so he could give up fly balls to righties all day.    Yes I realize Sabathia hasn't done well at Yankee Stadium but it's a small sample size and...well he was facing the Yankee lineup.<br>  <br>  And I'd take Teixeira anyday over the the combination of Abreu and Giambi, and so would any GM in baseball (if they had the money)<br>  <br>  Two things could derail the Yanks; injuries and clubhouse problems.   But on paper, they're easily the best team in baseball|`|fQIxah8laa	I agree. Go Red Sox!|`|gwUq6HMUaa	I don't think they are going to make the play-offs this year, because of the reasons you stated.

1CgCx1E2aa	He's going back there, baseball players usually go back to where they started from, whether its their hometown or 1st major league home. Also his father played there too with him in 1990 they even homered back to back (only father-son duo to do so). So its a matter of comfort with the team|`|lp4wajLxaa	As far as I know this was the only AL team interested in him and that's exactly what he needed.  His career is coming to an end and he needed to be somewhere where he could DH.  Seattle was the best option for him.  I personally thought he would end up in Atlanta simply because I wasn't sure the Seattle fans would warmly welcome him back.|`|sitkfn5Maa	he can be DH and not get hurt, if he went to the braves he would of have to play and maybe injured himself again :( so its betterfor him to go to an american league where he can play here and there but can always bat anytime.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	its his original team|`|fQIxah8laa	Yes I know that the Mariners are a bad team but I guess he  wants to go back there to end his MLB career where he started.  With the Mariners I mean, And he already stated that. So good for him.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Griffey's always been more about being in a comfortable environment than being the highest paid.  He passed up bigger offers to stay home in Cincinnati and now he's going back to where his career started and where the fans still love him.
D21xtjPPaa	No the federal goverment and NASA have been tring to construct a working time machine but the cant because they need to make a worm hole and that could conduct and become a black hole|`|s6yua5oxaa	Honestly,no,but you can seclude yourself in a small room,think of a particular memory,then pretend like you are actually in that time period.That's probably the closest you'll ever get to a time machine.|`|W0rRfLU0aa	technically speaking kinda. however we have no way to send any relivant matter back in time and we're not even sure if thats were it goes. Chances are its all just a load of bullshit science with a whole lotta maybes in it. so to answer your question in my opinion No.|`|EJMtFvq4aa	yes it doest exist.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No it doesn't, but I sure wish it did|`|KH9bbeCNaa	yes, it exists in a parallel universe, the only way u can get it is by going back in time and killing ur grandfather, which is impossible coz <br>  <br>  1. how would u go back in time<br>  2. even if u could, u would create a time paradox|`|Syn2excFaa	They are working on making a time machine by using powerful lasers watch the Discovery Channel video here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaq16YuEnE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaq16YuE...</a><br>  The Scientist behind working on a time machine was inspired by the fact that he could go back in time and prevent the death of his father.This video is in 5 parts.Whoever gave me a thumbs down obviously did not watch the video.Look at video description to find all 5 parts.|`|AA12022123	nope it is impossible for someone or something to time travel its just not possible because if you think about it while you are in the past or future,what is happening in the present time, so no sadly it will never happen|`|sitkfn5Maa	I think it does the government has it for a really bad situation. and the government lies a lot so they wont tell us. but that is what i think|`|AA11435718	NO it doesn't  I know
7f2GSDmqaa	I wouldn't be shocked, as if that happened, I'd look at it as Sting, the older veteran, is putting over the younger Cena, which would be good for business|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I would know that Sting let him go over. A sign of a great respect from a veteran like Sting.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	OMG! sting has been "SHUT THE **** UP"<br>  <br>  John Cena is way overrated now|`|AA11435718	NEVER to watch wrestling again|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	let me guess vince booked the match|`|1Va3yslbaa	I would...<br>  1.)yawn<br>  2.)fall asleep<br>  3.)change the channel<br>  or<br>  4.)all of the above!|`|tPFikOY7aa	You would know sting jobbed cause thats the worst submission move ever. I'd go as far as saying i'd never watch wrestling again.|`|w5GMjQndaa	I would hop the baracade and slap sting for tapping then beat the **** outta john cena with a chair|`|W0rRfLU0aa	i would never watch wrestling again.|`|bSsBGrZVaa	It would be a dream match but if John Cena<br>  locks Sting into STF & Sting tapped out it would<br>  be truly shocking
ZdNSSm0waa	1. 1996<br>  2. 1984<br>  3. Possibly 2003, depends how each player turns out|`|08c47ade809f8810ef2b21fa9304d450aa	The 1996 class is awfully good, but the 2003 class is very special as well, and it'll take a while before we can compare the two (once the 2003 guys play most of their careers).  The 1984 and 1970 classes are also both very special with multiple HoF caliber players (no one ever mentions the 1970 class for whatever reason).|`|nTYQgp7eaa	I wouldn't say ever but it was very good. Michael Jordan and Lebron years were good too. Also the 2008 draft was very good, they have a lot of potential.|`|3nN1vTTuaa	no, it was 2003. Lebron, Wade, Melo, Bosh. that's going to go down as one of the greatest classes of all time.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	'96 was the best ever because it had more than 4 or 5 great players. '96 was STACKED.|`|QJgcwXzxaa	You forgot about the legendary 1984 Draft.. with players like Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkely, John Stockton, and of course, His Airness Michael Jordan. But yeah the 1996 Draft is legendary with Iverson, Nash, Kobe, Allen, and Big Ben all in the draft. But since most of these players are past their prime (except Kobe), we have to wait a couple of years whether the 2003 Draft is comparable to the 1996 or the 1984 Drafts.|`|U3KAgO0baa	WOW i never thought about i b4... and i tought that the 03 draft was special.... 96 was AMAZING....<br>  Marcus Camby is that MAN!|`|w8AFCj5xaa	possibly   2003 is defiantly up there too|`|4DcvpQXfaa	No<br>  <br>  1984 was the best ever|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Yeah, I liked 1996 the best. Although 3/4 of the 2nd round picks we barely hear about but I know who they are.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Yes it was
z5rlyGXNaa	not so good|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	They will miss the playoff this year unless they pull of a miracle or something|`|100mwB8Qaa	they will do less alley opps and play slow and fewer alleyoops|`|zkovxRseaa	they will lose to the clippers now
Gva0qq3Yaa	To add to Ryan -<br>  <br>  A backwards hat is only worsened by no hat at all unless you use the hockey style mask (which I do).  Practice hinging your mask at home in front of the mirror to keep the hat in place.<br>  <br>  PS I used a combo hat before I switched to the hockey style mask.<br>  Smaller bill and easier for mask removal.|`|2e4136dce9654275a96b53a0c5bb55ffaa	Unless you are wearing the hockey style mask, you must wear a hat while doing the plate.<br>  <br>  I wear a regular base hat without any problems. It fits fine and doesn't come off when I take my mask off. You need to practice removing your mask more.|`|IjQZznfXaa	get a plate hat - it will fit under the mask
YwEFJWR7aa	Yup he'll play in 09 baseball season and have a solid year|`|zkzXmcgXaa	He will absolutely play again. There is no way the Yankees will let him go. They have him signed on a new contract and if they did let him go another team would pick him up by day's end. He is a superstar. Yes, a superstar that took 'roids, but he is still a superstar.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	He may never give another press conference the rest of his career, but A-Rod will play another ten years for the Yankees.|`|zQ9LeQiKaa	I don't think they'd go that far for his first offense. But he possibly could be suspended for 50 games though.|`|pChoen9haa	Yes.|`|GfzaszPPaa	of course he will|`|C4woRaDzaa	thats a stupid question|`|fQIxah8laa	Um yes.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Yeah? He's playing this season...|`|mwxKnUleaa	II think so unless something crazy happens|`|V430UrvFaa	Yes, he is not retiring.|`|AA10527991	Yeah, like starting in a few weeks.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	duh

uxregJ0faa	LOL @ self defense^<br>  <br>  Define self defense<br>  <br>  <br>  Z shoulda gotten the same treatment. I agree Z went after to start something so all this '' self defense is bull''. He just wanted a piece of V plain and simple|`|hkzGYQD4aa	HOW WAS IT JUST AS BAD??? Villanueva grabbed Z by the neck! What did Z even do that was so bad?? He was standing up for his teammate! I cannot believe you can be so idiotic!<br>  <br>  You haven't given one reason why Z should be ejected. Villanueva didn't just push Z away, he grabbed him by the neck!|`|EKF2HdZKaa	wow<br>  z stood up for his teamates,charlie was tryin to choke him,its called self defense<br>  charlie actually did a flagerant 2 foul on anderson<br>  z got called for a technicall<br>  it was a good calll<br>  <br>  Edit-self defense=gettin charlies arms off u and gettin pissed,u dont get ejected for standin up for ur teammate and for self defense,u get a tech|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	OMG! wow<br>  <br>  Grabbing somebodies neck and chocking them is just as bad as confronting a player when he commits a flagrant two on his teammate. <br>  <br>  Anyways Charlie got ejected for the flagrant two. Z got a technical for confronting Charlie like that.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Charlie V wasnt ejected for the thing with Z. He was ejected for the hard foul on Varejo. He had him held by the head and pulled down even after Varejo ahd the ball in his possession. That's what got him ejected.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I'm guessing because Charlie was grabbing his neck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Witness, two thumbs up.|`|ZlOY8FCJaa	nothing wrong with what z did, that's basketball, you don't just let a player get away with trying to intentionally hurt one of your teammates. villanueva will be fined for sure and probably suspended.|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	Z didnt even touch Charlie, Charlie hit Andy in the face and choked Z<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You are correct, Z did come at Villaneuva which is only grounds for a technical foul which is what he received|`|4j92pzJxaa	That was bs, BIG Z should have got ejected.<br>  <br>  Carlie V was playing great too.|`|j0YJX8U6aa	im not sure cus i didnt c it

oMSTg5rQaa	How Kobe Bryant is even in the discussion is beyond me.<br>  <br>  Kobe has an A+ supporting cast while Lebron's supporting cast is only a C+, yet the Cavs are still competing for the leagues best record. <br>  <br>  Also, Lebron has an edge in virtually every major statistical category.<br>  <br>  While I thought Chris Paul was just as deserving of the MVP last season, I was fine with Kobe winning it. It was a toss up. <br>  <br>  This season though, LEBRON IS CLEARLY THE 2008-09 MVP.<br>  <br>  I'd also like to add that the Cavs do not have to finish with leagues best record for Lebron to win MVP. They merely have to reach 60 wins or have one of the leagues top 3 records.|`|U3KAgO0baa	IMO wade is the MVP, 2 have that team in the playoffs is CRAZY!<br>  But who ever leads their team 2 the best record in the NBA (either Kobe, or Lebron) will win the MVP...|`|7RBdjcl2aa	Chris Paul he leads the league in steals, assists, triple doubles. is fourth in the league in double double, broke two records this season and the Hornets suck without him in the lineup.|`|H6GYZqHvaa	Definetely Lebron!!!<br>  <br>  Answer Mine!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApWkIBTBROqe8KPREC1kQzPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220180710AAoTAbF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ISQAWUf2aa	You put the  wrong records caveliers 41 and 11 Lakers 44 and 10<br>  <br>  you put ceveliers 44 and 11 thats not right!!|`|JQlc9vmDaa	kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe kobe|`|4DcvpQXfaa	LeBron<br>  <br>  Cavs winning game improve so much|`|D61u7t1zaa	Cavs are 41-11 dumbass|`|248105516e0a10aa90a923223f69a619aa	stats dont win MVP sometimes. id say kobe should win the MVP trophy because LAL is in more tougher conference.<br>  <br>  if Lebron wins the MVP id say still its because of the hype.|`|YyqYNFePaa	I Want Kobe to win it that is my favorite player, but They will give it to Lebron since Kobe got it last year|`|S7lgHdjXaa	kobe bean bryant!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|xhHfXuKFaa	depends on team record. kobe scored 35 per game and didn't win it. its not all based on stats.|`|reIMLCKkaa	We will see how their teams finish.

I could be wrong though because I haven't followed too much bball in last few weeks but   Kobe has Pau gasol and  I am not  surei f Bynum is  still out or what   but   you get what I am  saying  .  Lebron has the God given talent and leadership   and thats why he will be MVP but   Kobe  and his Lakers will win the NBA CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE END AND KOBE WILL BE  FINALS MVP.        ZZZZZZZZIIIIINGGGGG!!!!|`|4UilmYwKaa	forget kobe/lebron<br>  <br>  aaron brooks and carl landry will be co-mvps.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	Whoever has the best record should get it.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Too bad your opinion doesn't mean **** as to who gets the award.  I'm not saying Kobe should get it over Lebron or visa versa.  Lebron has better stats because he is the only player on his team I guess.  Mo Williams ain't ****!  LOL!  I guess.  What about Wally?  Or Wallace?  They might not be huge names, but without them, they wouldn't be where they are right now. <br>  <br>  But to answer your question.  I'm not going to give you five reasons to say one will get the MVP.  But I will tell you this.  The Lakers beat the Cavs in both matchups.  The Lakers have the best record in the NBA.  The MVP will be the one who has the better record.  If the Lakers have the best record in the NBA, Kobe will get it. If the Cavs have the best record in the NBA, Lebron will get it.  That's how it is.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Last year Kobe was the reason the Lakers were there.  They traded for Gasol, but Kobe kept them in the tops before getting Gasol.  Paul was and is the reason New Orleans was and is so good.  He creates everything.  Ray, KG, Pierce and RONDO (can't forget Rondo) all helped the Celtics.  Not one of them showed that they were the one for the Celtics dominance.

lkm7qgYqaa	I know exactly what your talking about, I was about to try it but as I researched, it's not a good idea. You will definitely need a feedneck for your gun because your hopper will fall and if electronic will break. Get a Q-lock clamping feedneck or a cheap trinity.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	If your gonna do that, duct tape the hopper to the feedneck (ball feeder), so it won't crack anymore and stay on better. It won't be as good as a new elbow, but it will last for that day. Get another elbow after you play.|`|RuJYupFWaa	The part on the gun is called a feedneck.  That clear plastic thing is referred to as a feedneck adaptor or an elbow (as the old kind were bent like an elbow instead of completely vertical, but the name stayed the same).<br>  <br>  I've seen people do that, spreading the hopper neck apart to fit over the gun's feedneck (if it can do that, then it's not electric, as the shells on electric hoppers nowadays aren't that flexible or soft).  It doesn't hold up well, though, even if you tape it a lot, because the weight of the hopper filled with paintballs will wiggle itself loose when you run around.<br>  <br>  If you're playing at a paintball field, see if they sell spares or ask around.  If not, you may have to borrow a gun or rent or something.|`|sR3SUZC0aa	i got a friend that did just the same thing your talking about. he was a cheap ***, and was tired of buying those plastic elbows that break so easily. so he put a hose clamp on it and spread his hopper on his feed neck and hasnt had a single problem with it. and its been atleast 3 years now. maybe a little bit longer.

I mean in science, you would believe the evolution.  In religion, you believe you are created in God's image.  I searched and searched, and finally a chaplain explained it to me like this...... There is some truth to science but with God being the supreme creator.  It is difficult to make science and religion blend perfectly because science is right there in your face and proven and evidence of it all....right.... but with religion.... that is why it is called faith.  Because the father asks that you simply believe in him and his word.  Usually there is no face to face.... but you just have to take that leap of "Faith" and believe.<br>  So even though I am an educated man with a bachelors degree,  I have served almost 9 years in the US Navy and been around the world... I still  choose to accept Jesus as my personal saviour and believe he died for my sins and the sins of all mankind. I believe he rose from the dead and is alive today.<br>  That is why it is called "faith"<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Good luck and God Bless|`|vFlUT9Zzaa	Why does there have to be one or the other?<br>  <br>  In the past, there have been scientists who were priests, or other members of the church.<br>  <br>  To me, it's so crazy to think that this whole world and universe ((and the people in it)) just happened to be created because of some accident.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.

hMkb7H31aa	Very interesting question.  We hear the expression as it relates to something which is not considered playing fair, i.e., borderline cheating and taking advantage of the other team.  <br>  <br>  Examples:  <br>  1.  Being ahead 10 runs and stealing 2nd base in the top of the 9th.  <br>  2.  Stealing signs without disguising the effort - batter looking at catcher's fingers when giving signs to the pitcher.<br>  3.  Two or players from opposing teams discussing their teams strategies between themselves.<br>  <br>  Cardinal Rules are unwritten, but understood to be "rules".<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	There is only one Cardinal rule:<br>  <br>  Jorge Orta always beats the throw to 1st base.
Rz9vY53Aaa	your too young wait a few years...|`|ntFW13AUaa	If by snap your wrist, you mean break your wrist, you are mistaken. You won't break your wrist throwing a curveball. I've thrown a curve and a slide since I was ten, and I haven't had any problems. But, not to be a jerk, I have perfect form with both pitches. As long as you throw them correctly, you shouldn't have too much of a problem. People say it is bad because at a young age, you are still developing, and a breaking ball could cause trouble to your elbow ligaments, which could lead to serious problems, possibly even surgery. I would suggest you learn how to throw a 2seam fastball and a changeup first, because I guarantee when you get into high school, those are going to be the most impressive pitches to a coach. The senior ace at my school just learned how to throw a change, and in the last 5 games he has yet to give up an extra base hit in 27 innings, and he gave up 12 in 8 games last year.|`|bd7qDDGPaa	You have to be experienced I mean its not that hard you dont have to bea certain age to learn how to do it. Start practicing and learning now the better you will be when your older.|`|KC5yb3DQaa	It doesnt matter!!|`|agnca6W0aa	depends on 2 things<br>  1 how strong your arm is<br>  2 how you throw it<br>  I started throwing curve balls at 11 and if you snap your wrist I heard that's bad for your arm. learn to throw it the tomahawk way and you should be fine.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	As a general rule, you should not start experimenting with curve balls before high school and there are three basic reasons:<br>  <br>  1) Your body has not developed sufficiently to manage the strain that breaking balls put on it.  This is why body-development is actually more important than age.  If you're in the middle of a growth spurt at 17, your ligaments and tendons are already under great strain.  So even at that age I would lay off the breaking stuff.<br>  <br>  2) In general, the coaching quality necessary to teach and monitor your mechanics just aren't available in youth leagues.  Bad habits could set you back even farther than serious injury.<br>  <br>  3) At your age, the most important thing you can work on is your command, confidence and mechanics.  An average fastball with very good location is all you need to dominate most Little Leagues.  At this point, a curve would just be an unnecessary "gimmick" and will distract you from focusing on the basics.|`|f35bf12a8eff1dc4cd38d5447b69023aaa	well, it doeen't matter, if you know how to throw it.<br>  dont get limited by your age.

I would say Matt because Jeff has already said that he has wanted to move on. Shawn Michaels because it would be one of the centers of his career to have won a Wrestlemania match against the Deadman. Triple H because he wants revenge on his wife. <br>  In reality, my guesses would be Matt because Jeff has reached a high point in his career while Matt needs to capitalize on this to force himself into the main event. Shawn Michaels because Undertaker has offered to break his streak to many other superstars. Randy Orton because this could show everyone that he is the present and future of the company.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Jeff because thanks to Matt, he lost his title.<br>  The Undertaker, he has more experience and cuz he is my favorite.<br>  Triple H, especially what Randy did to Stephanie on Raw this Monday.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Hardy vs Hardy: they both have just as much desire to win<br>  <br>  Taker vs HBK: HBK<br>  <br>  HHH vs RKO: HHH|`|JiCfYfLraa	MATT HARDY<br>  TAKER<br>  RKO|`|W0rRfLU0aa	Matt he has way more to prove than jeff he is way way less successfull.

I believe that he shouldn't come back because then next season, he like you said will be able to fully recuperate his knee and of course, the wizards are going to get a good draft pick. Him coming back for the wizards late in the season won't make a big difference right away because sometimes it takes a while to get used to playing on the court again and they are most likely not going to be in the playoffs so I just think he should rest some more.

qfyCo23Vaa	I KNOW ITS REALLY LONG BUT IT WILL BE WORTH UR TIME<br>  <br>  <br>  Whether you started watching Hulk Hogan or Stone Cold Steve Austin, you dreamed of being a WWE pro wrestler. You know you could fly off the ropes like Rey Mysterio and talk smack on the microphone like John Cena. The road to the WWE is actually similar to other major league sports like baseball. Instead of learning to hit a curveball, you just need to learn to hit a guy with a clothesline--without actually hurting him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Take up a sport other than wrestling. Many WWE wrestlers started as well-rounded athletes playing football or other sports. You don't need to be a world-class athlete, but you should be conditioned as a wrestling match is a strenuous activity.<br>  Step2<br>  Take up amateur wrestling in school. Having a background in actual competitive wrestling has never been required, but it will help. Fans are growing more and more to like wrestlers that can pull off actual wrestling moves.<br>  Step3<br>  Attend professional wresting schools. The WWE does not personally sponsor any schools, but there are many independent schools and some sponsored by smaller wrestling companies. Check online to find a school near your area.<br>  Step4<br>  Take acting or speech classes. Remember that WWE wresting is a mix of sports and theater. You need to be an entertaining character as well as an athlete.<br>  <br>  The Pro Wrestling Ladder<br>  Step1<br>  Try out for a smaller, independent wrestling organization. This is the same as starting in the minor leagues in major league sports. The big difference is you will have to rely on yourself to move upward.<br>  Step2<br>  Get a tryout in Ohio Valley Wrestling, located in Louisville, Kentucky. This is the official training ground for the WWE, and almost all their wrestlers come from here.<br>  Step3<br>  Move up to the WWE to perform in dark matches. You will first take part in matches put on for the live fans before the televised matches. From here, you will likely move on to Heat, the WWE's webcast show.<br>  Step4<br>  Move up to WWE television shows. Your character will be assigned to either Raw, SmackDown or ECW. Many consider Raw to be the cream of the crop because it's televised live.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	go to raw and tell stphanie<br>  <br>  " make me a wwe superstar and allways give me advantage instead of gving to triple h other wise  will take your sould..im the 2nd generation dead man"|`|NXktxy8jaa	Professional Wrestling is now one of the most popular, exciting, and highest paying sports in the world today.

What these people don’t get to see are all practices and rehearsals that are not televised. During these rehearsals and practice a wrestler is in the ring every day for hours at a time. And if you thing that’s not hard work, go to a wrestling school and go at it for about 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Here is a typical day on the road for a WWE Pro Wrestler: You wake up at 7:00 in the morning. You get to the airport at 8:30. You take a flight across the country and arrive at 11:00. After renting a car, checking into a hotel room, and something to eat, it’s 1:00. Time to go to a photo shoot. So you drive to a mall and sign autographs until 3:00. It’s time to head on over to the arena. Getting through traffic, you might make it by 4:30. After you eat something and do a short workout, it’s 5:30. At that time you go talk to one of the bookers and he goes over your match with you. If you can find the time, you and your opponent do a quick run down of what’s going to happen. By then it’s 7:00 and it’s time to go on. You wrestle a match and leave the arena at 10:00. You get to the hotel by 12:00 and get some sleep before you do it all over again in the morning. Now find time to workout and keep the marvelous body a wrestler has. And you want some sort of social life don’t you? Good luck.<br>  <br>  But if you are determined, it isn’t impossible to become a wrestler. The first thing you must do is go to a local wrestling school. Prices vary between schools, but you can expect to pay a couple of thousand dollars for a good one. Ninety nine percent of people never make it past the school. Imagine high school football, except twice as hard. The trainer doesn’t care if you quit or not, he’s just doing his job. They let you know you’re going to get hurt, that’s unavoidable. Most people walk away from the school after the first week with painful bruises galore, sometimes worse. If you’re one of the truly tough and lucky, then it’s time for the independent federations.<br>  <br>  You’ll be working once or twice a week, in front of 100-300 people making $25 a night or sometimes nothing at all. This is to work on your ring skills and your personality. Some guys find themselves in these small leagues for years, others never make it past this stage. Now if you’re strong and lucky enough to get yourself booked in a show and a pro wrestling manager happens to be there, you have a slight chance he might like you. If he does, then you’ll be receiving a phone call or letter asking to wrestle a dark match. A dark match is a match done the night of a TV taping, but is not aired. They’re done to pump up the crowd. So you go to the big company, meet all the wrestlers, wrestle your match, and go home. Nine out of ten times you just wait for that to happen again. If you’re really a lucky one, you’ll get a phone call to come back and wrestle some more dark matches. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll get signed by a major company, such as World Wrestling Entertainment. This is the equivalent of the Major Leagues in Baseball.<br>  <br>  So as you can see, being a wrestler is a tough job. Even if you do make it through school and get hired by WWE, will you be able to handle the schedule? That’s something you have to ask yourself before you pursue this career.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	To start off you would have to train.<br>  Go to a nearby wrestling school and pay your money and train for a few months. I would recommend ROH's Training School. And after you train you can be able to send videos to WWE or a scout might see you. If you get into WWE you would then have to wrestling in FCW, and then in a couple of months you would be asked to do a dark match and if you are good enough you would be called up to the roster.<br>  <br>  (:|`|a5X1sHHpaa	Wow...first go to lots of wrestling training schools and then start off at some indies. Then try and make sure you end up in FCW , OVW, ROH, TNA , etc... so you can be spotted from the WWE.|`|100mwB8Qaa	i wouldnt want to go there, lot of guys use vitamin-S, become a doctor, football player or a astroanot
QJwaagGWaa	No, the song is a slight remake of "Metalingus" by Alter Bridge.|`|JiCfYfLraa	i thought so at first lol but no its alterbridge - metalingus|`|0ylaEVtraa	NO<br>  <br>  BAND Alter Bridge<br>  <br>  SONG Metalingus<br>  <br>  CD  One Day Remains|`|a5X1sHHpaa	okay i tohught HHH sings his own but i was wrong.<br>  I thought Randy sang his old theme but i was wrong...<br>  <br>  Edge...i knew it wasn't him though :D|`|3nN1vTTuaa	Does it sound anything like him?<br>  <br>  your answer is no!|`|11i3Xmb1aa	No, Alter Bridge sings its.<br>  <br>  (:|`|m6oc91sxaa	LMAO!!!!|`|6e88e6122f96ab00e51f25de52859bcaaa	"Metalingus" is performed by the band Alter Bridge.|`|2UkdpGHFaa	Nope.<br>  It's Alterbridge.|`|qfyCo23Vaa	No, Alter Bridge Does. Its Called "Metalingus"|`|VZQdcqXDaa	in his dreams hes that good at something and no|`|lGIL36faaa	no
wXxJUnLJaa	Last time I checked he has 7 assist. Idk what he finished with|`|kKbqdlbnaa	29min 1-9 FG, 0-3 3PFG, 8 Assists, 3 Steals, 1 TO, 3pts<br>  Rusty debut. He'll get better with time. <br>  <br>  I think he's happy to be with a contending team. I'm glad the Rockets didn't trade him to some scrub team because that would be harsh, especially considering how hard he has played for Houston over the years.|`|nTYQgp7eaa	He isn't doing too bad now, he will fit in with Orlando and when Jameer comes back he will be a good back up and the Magic will have good depth at the point.
tPaRZod9aa	<a href="http://www.nfl.com/teams/minnesotavikings/profile?team=MIN" rel="nofollow">http://www.nfl.com/teams/minnesotaviking...</a><br>  <br>  This will tell you the latest stuff about Minn. and the Viks website.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Yea, that they suck.|`|EP5zl16Oaa	Yeah, that they might want to get Michael Vick.
qtfUbuZGaa	well i would go with the adult cup because thats whats gonna fit you best thats what i wear and im 16 i like it so thats whats i would go with|`|A5p9g4tMaa	I would go with a medium or large you will need the room.
a5hNA3Kxaa	It will be Shawn Michaels, guaranteed, despite what Vickie said, it will not be Kozlov, it will not be JBL either. JBL isnt a draw, he cant showcase a match of that stature. JBL is not good in the ring anymore. Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker will draw viewers GUARANTEED! now a match like Kozlov vs Taker or JBL vs Taker will not, we have all seen JBL vs Taker before, but we have not seen Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker since like 1999 in a one on on match and that was a hell in a cell- correct me if I am wrong, and now that they are both veterans and definite Hall of Famers, that match will be much worth watching. Guaranteed, and too book a match like that is good buisness because it is the type you will pay to see, that match will help PPV sales, thus gaining Vince money.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	It seems like its Koslov|`|w5GMjQndaa	Shawn Micheals duh!! He head lined Wrestlemania with Flair last year and why would they give it to JBL who hasnt had a decent Wrestlemania since what 21?|`|pLYY0SlFaa	Shawn Michales should|`|W0rRfLU0aa	it will be HBK cause noone really watches the JBL matches at PPVs anymore|`|0ylaEVtraa	HBK BUT TAKER WOULD BEAT HIM
bOK5MQViaa	ICC-illinois cheer company|`|aVAAYMZmaa	HEYY Ya i loveee ICC but they were ICE<br>  They are really good. Cheer Command is good too<br>  And what happened to Meanstreets I never see them anymore
16JetWj3aa	Petey Williams will never be in WWE. <br>  <br>  Not that I don't think Petey is good. He's got a good mind for the business and is a GREAT worker with arguably the best finish out there today. But Vince is really high on guys with a body that are big, and Petey just isn't that big. Cut and certainly the "Definition of Definition" but not what Vince is looking for. <br>  <br>  Again, not that I agree. You'd think after all the deaths and negative press steroids has caused WWE they would be willing to at least TRY and broaden their horizons, but I doubt it. You mentioned Christian? Look what they've done with him. A big fat nothing, despite the fact that the fans love him. <br>  <br>  Sorry Maple Leaf Muscle Fans, but if you're a little guy looking to get over in the WWE - pray you're a leprechaun.|`|Ub0jc6lFaa	Most likely, don't know what type of gimmick he would have but he can make any gimmick and fued work... some said killings. christian and now him... Well tna got killings from us first he was K-Kwik with wwf or the beginning of the wwe name change b4 wwe released him i believed then he went to tna|`|W0rRfLU0aa	if WWE doesnt pick up a guy with the talent of Williams they are dumber than i thought. Hell stick him on ECW and get Christian the hell outta there.|`|gi0haHtdaa	Ron Killings<br>  Christian Cage<br>  Petey Williams<br>  <br>  Who is next?|`|1Va3yslbaa	hope so then they should bring back the cruiserweight championship!|`|EJMtFvq4aa	Hes going to TNA|`|7f2GSDmqaa	IMO Petey is just too small for WWE, and hed be misused since there is no CW division. Hed end up jobbing all the time to guys like Umaga and Mike Knox.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	indies i hate that they relesed him it pisses me off very deeply and tna will suffer a little with his absents but well wait and see i wish him the best|`|oPAi65Q2aa	Even though TNA releases him, it is kinda like what happened with Kaz, he is semi-gone, I expect petey to turn up in TNA at the right time|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	most likely<br>  <br>  TNA released him cuz he can actually wrestle lmfaoo|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I hope so but I think RoH is after him as well. I guess it's up to him now to decide.|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	i hope not

a5hNA3Kxaa	I think Jeff vs Cena vs Edge at Mania, is a terrible idea. This is there 25th anniversary, they need to make this memorable. I think Jeff vs Matt would be awesome, a match to possibly steel the show, but I do feel they need a gimmick match for this, possibly TLC. I do not want to see them in MiTB, I would rather see the two of them one on on, and the storyline between the 2 isn't over, so there is still in the air of what will happen between them. On the other hand Edge was on Raw with Cena and that seems to be in place for Wrestlemania, I am pretty sure we will see Jeff vs Matt, hopefully in a TLC match|`|diCASlUXaa	Jeff v. Cena v. Edge = Terrible Idea.<br>  <br>  Jeff v. Matt: Gonna happen next week.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	At Mania it will be Edge and Cena.<br>  The Hardy's will be fighting each other but it will have nothing to do with the title.|`|ptDHZK7Jaa	jeff vs cena vs edge highly doubt it i realy do|`|w5GMjQndaa	Very slim because its going to be so far:<br>  <br>  John Cena vs Edge/ WHC<br>  <br>  Triple H vs. Randy Orton/ WWE<br>  <br>  Shawn Micheals vs Undertaker/ icon vs streak<br>  <br>  Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy/ possible tlc or ladder<br>  <br>  Christian vs jack swagger vs finlay/ ecw|`|4eQqTiYwaa	Jeff will refuse to fight matt on SD! . but i think eventually matt will push jeff to breaking point and he'll accept and beat the s*** outta matt|`|GQWGLSexaa	Jeff v. Cena v. Edge = hardly will ever happen<br>  <br>  Jeff v. Matt = pretty good chances of happening|`|tPFikOY7aa	Chances are high. I don't want to be a spoiler but they dont end up fighting on smackdown. Jeff refuses.|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	Pretty good chance..but they taking their time to start it up...no jeff and matt promo since jeff returned..|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Jeff vs Matt at Mania|`|uEfoR5BLaa	No they're going to fight on Smack Down aren't they. What's the point of fighting at Mania then?

a9U0aH54aa	If you are fast and tall but not heavy, then i think you will be playing saftey or corner because you can't get open. As long as you arent afraid to knock anyones head off :P|`|GZpwkL1Vaa	they'll put you at receiver, if your fast and tall its a good fit. They will teach you to run sharp routes to get open, and at 156 pounds you probably dont have the bulk to play anything other then that or corner. Plus at 6'4" you won't need to get to much seperation becuase the quarterback can just throw it high where the corner wont be albe to reach it.|`|utJYCCvaaa	probably CB or TE 6'4 is a good height and if you have a nice Vertical you will be prime time on slants|`|d99df786deb3c1bafe03741880e7fdd1aa	you're pretty tall but you don't way nearly enough. If you can gain 50 pounds you would be a beast at probably anything you wanted.|`|wPKUl3CTaa	You could probably play DB, S, WR, RB, and TE. If you have speed you could be lethal on Kickoff or Punt Return.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	waterboy|`|uFk8ohenaa	WR|`|edT0W5MOaa	you're light tall and can run fast...sounds like a wide receiver to me. However you mentioned you can't really get open so i recommend defensive/cornerback (same position) because they need to be quick too and size helps.|`|KZ4jEx3Saa	Safety or strong safety as long as you like to hit.  There won't be a ball that gets over your head or beef up and play outside linebacker or DE.....just get on the field!!!!!
S0u3HKzhaa	I personally don't think it would be a good idea.There just is too many people now to do that.The whole mid card would be eliminated practically.Most of the roster would have to be fired in order to make room for the main event status wrestlers.It worked before when there wasn't as many wrestlers now but now there is no way to fit five hours of television in a whole week in one two hour broadcast.I think it would just be a mess in my opinion.Maybe merging ECW and Smackdown wouldn't be so bad.But really I like the concept of two shows with two different storyline and wrestlers in their own feuds pn two separate shows.Myself I find ECW kind of pointless,it's a waste the talent could easily just be shown in dark matches and be on Smackdown or Raw.But really the wwe is to large of a company now to have one Superbrand again.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Hey, see, that is funny.<br>  <br>  I'm just afraid if they merged all the brands that we would not get to see any of the young talent or mid card wrestlers. We would get stuck with the same main events week after week. I do think there should only be one Champion to increase the prestige of being the Champion.|`|NvRHYkuiaa	Nah, that wouldn't work.|`|SsodRf4kaa	More time<br>  More main events<br>  More shows<br>  Less titles|`|ajn1jDYfaa	How are people saying this wouldn't work?...remember the days before there was a RAW, ECW, and SD brand?...all the wrestlers appeared on RAW together...I know some people will remember times like with the attitude era...the ministry...the old degeneration X...I think when all the wrestlers were together it allowed for so many more story line possibilities, such as The Rock...one week he could be a face the next week he could be a heel...and he had matches against big names and mid carders, the same went for Triple H, Undertaker, HBK, etc...I think with the merging of all brands again there could be so many possibilities of matches and more of a focus on the IC belt and tag team belts...and to fill some holes bring back some old titles, such as the hardcore and European...it just seems that right now there are a limited number of guys to work with to make story lines that the creative team has to keep something going for 4 months even though the direction gets stale and predictable (we all knew HBK was going to win) the creative team could use some more wrestlers to spice up a story line...|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I don't think it'd be a good idea.<br>  Pros: different feuds, variety of main eventers.<br>  Cons: If you think good superstars who happen to be mid/low-carders don't get enough TV time, it'd be extremely worse if everyone was on the same show. They'd get completely overshadowed|`|Wu1PXYbGaa	Well then we coudl se some big matches that's the advantage(that's why there are ppv's )<br>  The dissatvantage is that they only have 2 hours to make the show so not many superstars can compete in 1 night|`|hdp7bv45aa	It wouldn't work because some of the wrestlers might not get a chance to wrestle|`|2PCMiMJraa	pro- undisputed title<br>  cons- only the top guys get shots, and only once a week|`|qbEeecndaa	wouldnt work|`|MVvxfEIzaa	it will be nice , but having one show a week isn't|`|2FKHNIB2aa	While it sounds like a good idea when you think about it, it wouldn't work because they would have to release tons of midcard superstars because they don't get tv time, and there would be far fewer feuds all in all there is just not enough tv time to merge the brands.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	it would be very nice to have a superbrand
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	It would have to be the Briscoe Brothers vs Kevin Steen and El Generico in a Ladder War match for the ROH World Tag Team Titles at the Man Up ppv in September 2007.It's easily the best indy match i've ever seen and it's a twenty-seven minutes rollercoaster full of technical moves, Lucha Libre wrestling and high spots action.|`|3icTrKLLaa	Samoa Joe vs CM Punk    (Punk vs Joe II)  It was full of suspense! Joe was soooo close to pinning Punk (5 seconds), but time ran out. Anytime a 60 minute draw happens, it is a classic match    Nigel McGuiness vs Austin Aries at Supercard of Honor III has a special place in my heart as well because i was in the front row and Aries fell right on top of me. I marked out like a little girl.      And im guessing "Champion Jeff Hardy" has never seen an Indy match in his life.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	paul london vs samoa joe in ROH years ago|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Most Bryan Danielson matches.

RS3fjNboaa	There are no targets there for the Cowboys. We don't need a receiver, unless he has blinding speed. We sure don't need another Roy Williams type safety, and we can't use a DE in a 3-4 defense. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're saying we can beat the Raiders with all those new holes on the team, then I'll agree. The Cowboys have a target.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	With the huge contracts Asomugha and Lechler signed yesterday, I am surprised they haven't cut the whole team. <br>  <br>  Really though, Curry was a third receiver at best. Gibril Wilson never lived up to what they had hoped.|`|f1HKgd4Gaa	cutting Wilson really surprised me , i was expecting Curry , but Wilson was surprise|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, when you give your CB A-Roid money and you give your punter RB money, you're really in need of all the cap space you can save.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I love it.  They have to cut two players in order to barely make enough cap room for the punter's contract.
urqGJPwpaa	Lol yeah.  CP3 WAS...no arguably, he WAS the best player tonight.  99% of the Laker fans on this site are so biased...cough like a chick who answered your question cough.  Kobe was the best player in OT, but that's it.  We got very lucky to get the win, but it showed the Lakers can fight back, and it showed Phil Jackson has a little too much confidence in his bench.  Lol.|`|WUzgGtAAaa	The first 3 and 1/2 quarters were kind of ugly to be honest. A lot of bricks and some sloppy play. I thought the Lakers would lose when the Hornets came back from the Lakers big lead. The Lakers bench really let them down today. The last 5 minutes or so and overtime were very exciting and very intense.  Fisher was huge and so was Kobe.<br>  <br>  Butler and Posey played well. Paul was excellent, but his charging foul cost the Hornets the game. If he passed it to the trailer, I think it was Posey, on the break they would have gotten an easy basket, or a foul and the game would have been over.  Also, Peja was terrible he missed a lot of open looks.<br>  <br>  A good game down the stretch, and the Hornets were tough.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I think if anything it shows that the Hornet can beat this Lakers team.  They came back from 16 down and trailing by 10 in the 4th quarter and basically had the game won except for the blunder from Paul.  If he would have passed or dribble away and try to use some of the clock the Lakers would of have to foul anyway but I believe they would have won this game<br>  <br>  But in any case the Hornets Like I said showed that they can beat this team on the Lakers floor,<br>  <br>  For those to say no Bynum well there was no Chandler either,|`|9UhoUcM2aa	it was awesome. <br>  <br>  and Kobe was arguably the BEST player tonight.. <br>  right along with Fisher.. who pretty much won the game for the Lakers with that 3 pointer to go into OT<br>  <br>  EDIT: wellll....cp3 also fouled out. Kobe and Fisher were amazing tonight..Lakers win..(=|`|L3BfvJQiaa	CP3 was not the best player tonight. Remember, he got himself fouled out in OT and was unable to help his teammates. He also went for the shot and was charged with an offensive foul at the end of regulation when he could have dribbled it out, forcing the Lakers to foul. It was his fault the Hornets lost. Hornets did make many of their threes through. It was mostly the Lakers' fault that they had to win the game that way; They did not play very well and gave up a 16 point lead. In the end, all that matters is that the Lakers won and the Hornets lost.|`|7bx2XQlqaa	Im not gonna lie, we really escaped one tonight.  We were lucky in many ways to come away from a win tonight.  Fisher saved us with that 3 and in overtime Paul fouled out so we really took adavantage of that. <br>  <br>  But I say we sort of escaped with a win because kobe had 30 shot attempts, Paul was outstanding, and we shot horribly from the field.  Im not sure what our record is when Kobe has over 21 shot attempts, but its something like 2-9.  In other words, when Kobe has to carry the ENTIRE load offensively, we almost always lose.  But tonight, against a very solid team, we came away with a win, that is all that matters.<br>  <br>  This win really proved that we can find ways to win in just about any situation.  Wasn't the prettiest victory but I'll take it.|`|D61u7t1zaa	Lakers won. Thats what matters.|`|N5Cnuay0aa	d-fish won the game for the lakers.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Kobe goes wild in OT!|`|4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	The game was intense. For N.O. to come back from a 16-point deficit, in itself, is very impressive. Then for them to make it rain from beyond the arch, get the foul calls, get the extra point plays off fouls, and manage to keep the score within a 1 possession game with 3's everytime it looked as if the Lakers ended it, very impressive. There first mistake although was not fouling Odom when they had him in the deep corner off the inbound, instead allowing the ball into Kobe's hands then fouling.<br>  <br>  I would say Bryant was the most impressive player of the game, or in NBA LIVE terms, he was the "Jordan Player Of The Game" LOL. He outscored everyone, which isn't unusual for him, but to have 11 in the overtime period, which is only a 5-minute period, to lead his team to victory, was what clinched his spot as the best player of the night. CP3 did exceptional as well and the call against him which ultimately got him his first boot, was arguable, controversial, but it was the call nonetheless, brought upon by Bryant, which made him that much more effective. <br>  <br>  Something not many people like about Bryant is he knows how to draw a foul. Even when it's his fault, he knows how to make it the other players. This isn't cheating by any means, as he does this in every game and in every stadium, not just Staple Center, so it's not bias refs. The dude just has a natural instinct for the kill shot and how to ice the other team. He knows where to stab you and make it hurt, a lot... by fouling out CP3, it hurt them a lot, it drained a lot from them to see they're star player foul out, for the first time that season,  then to finish the overtime period without him. Not only did it drain the team but it boosted the momentum and adrenaline of the stadiums fans and Lakers team as well. <br>  <br>  Bryant knows how to get it done...|`|u2QhQAxzaa	It was a good game for the Lakers.  Derek Fisher saved the game for the Lakers, which I thought was good for them, considering Kobe always takes the big shots, finally someone else stepped up.  As far as, CP3 being the best in the game, I would have to disagree.  Foul out, is always a players fault, whatever bad the calls may be.  He ultimately lost it for his team by scissor kicking KOBE.  That could of been avoided but he did that crap on purpose.  I would say Rasual Butler was the player of the game, or Fisher for that 3 to send it into OT.|`|KTp27Fokaa	It's funny how people are saying CP3 wasn't the best player because he fouled out, especially considering that his 6th foul was BS and should have been a foul on Kobe.

He made the decisions he made. Steroids do not make you kill the people you love. Guys have a choice of whether to use or not to use. There is a alot of pressure to use but he could have declined.

ywU3ZpIgaa	HBK could interupt the taker Orton match by making taker lose and at No way Out have Taker interfere at Shawn Michaels V JBL match and have him make HBK lose i doubt this would happen as they are trying to get Big Show V Taker at Mania and then they would have to throw JBL in somewhere as well like you said they probably will save it for next year I cant wait cause it would be a great match|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	i think they are planning on going with taker vs hbk at this years mania because i think within a year taker and\ or hbk will retire|`|J2bLQcHNaa	HBK will win.|`|AA11482019	When Michaels beats JBL at No Way Out, that will be the end of the storyline.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I was really pleased to see Mickie James back in the ring again in a match as she's been underused lately.With Kelly Kelly and Melina getting all the focus, Mickie has had to take a back seat while they get pushed.Hopefully now Mickie herself will get to challenge for the Women's title as she's my favorite Diva ans works an amazing style of technical Lucha Libre wrestling.    http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2f8wv_...|`|3icTrKLLaa	I am always excited when Mickie comes to the ring. Not only is the the hottest diva, but in my opinion she easily is the most talented female wrestler in WWE.    Candice bores me.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I was pleased to see Mickie, but I can care less about Candice. She just comes across as easy to me.|`|NNn84vTCaa	Mickie, yes. I was estastic to see her with Punk, both being former Indy legends. Candice, ugh, she was pathetic in the ring. She didn't show much enthusiasm or heart for that matter, she was awful if im honest. Candice hasn't got long left in the WWE, i can see her getting released within the next 2 years, or retiring. Mickie on the other hand, didn't wrestle much, but she was awesome and took a nasty bump, go Micky!|`|T13xM9iJaa	I was happy to see them both both back in action especially Mickie I really do like her    And yes RAW was CRAZY but it is gonna be even more CRAZIER next week|`|84ceqOC4aa	i was (:       But.. they both lost /:|`|q4v9lO6Laa	When i saw cm punk and mickie james come out, it was pretty cool to see them together since a few months together i saw them at an autograph signing and they were great friends. I was also happy to see candice since she hasnt had a televised match since october as far as i remember. But i hope they dont start using her as a jobber|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	I was happy to see Mickie.

UxooffHZaa	yes and no. I think he was taken out of consideration because of it, but I think Holmes would have won anyway. Holmes had a good game throughout, and Harrison one huge play. If Harrison had a sack or two to add to his int, then he'd of won, regardless of his thuggery.|`|8c5dfb8ff876deaaa25ab74d326f84a7aa	Absolutely not. Anyone who watches the Steelers knows that every player is capable of being a dirty thug. Seeing as they won the game one of the thugs had to win the MVP. I am just happy it wasn't Ryan Clark the dirtiest player in the NFL.|`|lqKfFxcTaa	Nah, Holmes was the key player to the Super Bowl winning drive.|`|ScPIXjj9aa	No not really.  Holmes was the big influence in the games. Even though Harrison made that insanely awesome play, Holmes made many more. Holmes was picked because he made the game winning TD for the Steelers. AND 9 receptions tooo.     P.S - Steelers rock!!!!!!!|`|a6EndAPiaa	It is hard to say.  I am sure that penalty changed the vote of a few of the voters.  However, once Holmes made that TD catch I thought the only way that Harrison could even have a remote chance was if he caused another turnover on the Cardinals last drive.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yes i do and the voters always do seem tovote on the last big thing that they just saw and that was the holmes catch.|`|qsK7YNhDaa	no way|`|TM2yK8nQaa	If it didn't, it should have.

Tom Brady vs. Joe Montanna, Terry Bradshaw, and John Elway... ill go with 3 of the best quarterbacks even... against one of the best ever|`|VH1ze729aa	OK seriously...how can you include Brady Quinn and Joe Flacco when I don't see PEYTON MANNING on the list? But I would definitely pick Montana, Bradshaw, and Elway...unless you include Manning
sNy23JzHaa	Danm why does everyone give Sven such a short time.  He doesn't even have a year with the team and the final group stage hasn't even started.    I don't want Aguirre to coach Mexico right now, because it will be the same story of Mexico in the WCs, last minute coaches.  In 1994 Mejia-Baron, 1998 La Puente, and 2002 Aguirre.  Last minute coach comes in qualifies, doesn't go past the second round and less than a year after the WC he's gone.      What I think is that Aguirre should be given El Tri as a project to find talent and change the face to adapt a particular style, like La Volpe was given.  What I want is for Aguirre to grab El Tri right after the World Cup and have it for the 4 years, I guarantee you that would be the key to passing to the famous 5th game of the WC, and if this works why not have him a full 8 so a style can be developed.    Mexico is the amateur team in every WC, we never have a unique style we always change.  With Mejia-Baron in 1994 we were a balanced team with a lot of shots from the out side, (that's how most of our goals came, but then again we had nothing but distance shooters.  Ambriz, Aspe, M. Bernal, Hugol and others) but our strongest point was the defense with a great goalie.      Come 1998 with La Puente we played as a conservative team that attacked in blocks and it worked, Germany just got lucky with a last minute goal.      In 2002 with Aguirre we were an offensive team the whole way, we scored like crazy until we played the US who knew our tactics by heart and used it to their advantage, it seemed like we dominated the game by having the ball but the truth is the US had more chances than we did on top of the goals they scored.    2006 La Volpe had it but never came up with a solid group to play even during the WC you never really knew who the starters were going to be, that was BS.    To me 2010 is going to be just like that all over again, I honestly doubt we will make it to a 5th game.  We will qualify to the WC I can put as much money as you want on that, it's harder to not pass once Mexico makes it to this stage.  No matter who the coach is, Mexico will not loose in Mexico and will gain a few points out side.      I say let Sven stay, maybe by the World Cup he will have a settled and healthy squad, and give the team to Aguirre to manage for the following 4 years.  A lot of other coaches have adapted some what of his style and who ever takes over El Tri after Aguirre will probably only make it better.  These coaches are still young and lately they've been the League champions, for example Guzman, Chepo de la Torre, Efrain Flores, El Profe Cruz.  Those are the top names right now, and in 6 years will have more experiance to take over after Aguirre.    Changing coaches right now would be a mistake, just like it was letting Hugo go.  At least Hugo recruited talented players for El Tri like Magallon who was not consider until Hugo got there and Nery Castillo who La Volpe couldn't convince in the past.  I vote to : leave Sven finish his work and let Aguirre take over right after the World Cup.      Saludos..........|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Well I think he might have grown up since the last time he coached for Mexico. But who knows. I mean he does like lots of extranjeros|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	like many I think its all going to be based on the game vs. the US, i think like u say if mexico plays its usual crappy style and lose against the US, Aguirre's name will pop out of everywhere...    BUT, i dont know if many of you know already, Sven was offered a coaching job at Real Madrid not too long ago but he rejected saying that he had a contract to fullfill in Mexico. Which that says alot about him as a person....well I really just hope Sven starts doing his thing and el GIGANTE despierte otra ves.    im really getting tired of all these Gringos, but mostly all these damn central americans saying that they are close to the level of Mexico....NO MAMEN!!|`|8zgFyfibaa	Yes and no but let me explain.    Yes,because he knows the mexican style and has experience coaching european teams. And if eriksson looses to the usa then yes eriksson should get fired and aguirre should coach mexico again.....     The reason I said no is because,that's the problem with mexico they change coaches like they do they're underwear. And we don't give them time to adapt and learn the mexican style of the futbol game.    But,overall I think if eriksson looses to the usa and looses the next game then yes he should get fired. Aguirre can pick up the pieces and bring mexico back up from the slumps they had last year.|`|MMTZuSY8aa	I rather see him coach Mexico, Mexico has been really bad and I don't think Sven knows what he is doing; they don't seem to have a strategy when they are on the field.|`|JiKNOtvdaa	Well right now Ericksson is doing really bad, and if he losses to USA and the next game, then yes they should fire Ericksson and get Javier Aguirre|`|qbPbvLuLaa	If Sven can't handle Mexico then I think Aguirre should be the new coach.|`|D3RDQDHMaa	it all depends whata happens with the game vs. usa likeyou said if its ablow out i think he is out cause aguirre might get an offer from another team very quick but i say this it mostly the players are the reason we are struggling right now sven is getting an poor effort from our players|`|lwg40BzRaa	Erikkson is trying but i don't think it will be enough.    If we do lose to U.S, He is done. I hate to say it but he has made us worse then when we were under Hugo, I like that he is using naturalized players and taking advantages that are given to him, I don't know if Aguirre will do the same but he should.     I wish Erikkson the best.   If we kill the U.S then He will definitely stay. I guess you can say this is Erikkson's last stand.    Feb.11.09 will determine Mexico's future.  Lets Hope for the best|`|h5wjiC71aa	Absolutely, all we need now is an excuse to fire Sven and a loss to USA would be a perfect reason.|`|X4aweBgTaa	i agree with everyone else on this...if we get blown out, sven is gone and aguirre is in. im not sayin i like this too much because sven is a good coach, and he really isnt gettin our player's best efforts. then again, aguirre knows mexico futbol and will pick the best.|`|o2kW3eG0aa	nopw

CttL3LmBaa	At 13,   2 or 3 miles should be a yawn.  A warm up at best.  At your age we would ride (regular cruiser style) bikes that far just to get all our friends together to go fool around on the bikes for 4 or 5 more hours.  <br>  <br>  At 14 I bought my first road bike, and if you want to be a serious rider I suggest you do the same.  Nothing fancy maybe an entry level flat bar road bike from a bike shop.  Once I had my road bike the world was mine and I began riding further and further.  I did 5 - 100 milers and one 210 miler that year.  I got fit real fast.  <br>  <br>  My point in using myself as example -- yes you need to be biking more for good exercise.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You want to make sure your seat is adjusted properly.  You want to learn the pedal at a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  You want to ride as much as you can and you will see a big improvement.  Just remomber pedal fast with a lite pressure.|`|6qvRjvCmaa	If you're out of shape, build up your strength and and fitness levels first, then start taking longer rides. Also vary your rides, as you've been doing, between high-intensity, short distance and low intensity, longer distance. Remember to warm up & cool down, and to replenish lost fluids.|`|E70A7aqcaa	As a former AVID  bicyclist, I can tell you that "Bob A" 's answer is somewhat right, but, for someone your age, and with the limited bicycling experience you have, and not knowing the quality of bicycle you have, I'd say to take "Bob A"'s answer "with a grain of salt".   Making sure your bike is in good working order with properly inflated tires is very important.  Also, when you start riding bicycles more seriously for exercise, you MUST become oriented to drinking ever increasing quantities of water.  You'll find if you find yourself thirsty out on a ride, you will actually slow down, and can endanger your health.  Your body is 90+% water, and you WILL sweat, even if you don't realize it, because the passing wind will dry your sweat away.  Also, eating enough food, and GOOD food, not just junk, is extremely important in bicycling as an exercise or as a sport.  Since I don't know more specifically about your present health, or the quality of bicycle you're riding, I can suggest that talking with someone at a real bicycle shop (as opposed to WalMart, KMart, Target, and the  likes) will be very helpful in developing a riding plan.  Oftentimes these bicycle shops have their own riding club, and the members go on very leisurely rides at various lengths, and they're very good at "bringing up" new and young riders in the best riding techniques.  Go visit a few REAL bicycle shops and become acquainted with the store owners and employees there.  They can be a wealth of information, and can see you and your bicycle first hand and help you develop a riding plan.  And if they have their own bicycle club that goes on rides, join 'em.  You'll love it, I promise you.  And there's always plenty of food at their rides so you can replenish your body with all the calories you're going to burn up.  And you WILL burn up a LOT of calories.  Enjoy.  God Bless you.
qaz33UnNaa	with some adjustments maybe like the teams have to set up a card where you have permanant subs (1 or 2) for one guy but you cant have a guy sub for more than one guy so if lebron fouls hes out of the game for 30 45 seconds but a backup comes in who is not nearly as good giving the other team an advantage... maybe i don't know but interesting|`|ewW1CY3Waa	For Flagrants that would be great|`|2k5LtdXPaa	No but its a good idea. If you added the power play i think it would make games even more unfair. The refs are already bad as it is and who knows say thyey are pulling for one team when there officiating well if we had the power play theyd call fouls on there opposing teams best player and thn there team could take advantage of tht with the power play. I dont think they need the power play although itd b interesting i mean thy have the foul limit so it doesnt rly matter neways.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	stick to hockey dude. if it were a flagrant 2 foul maybe but no way its totally a different game|`|wU4PxWPSaa	I think that it is silly and unfair! Although, i only dislike it because it would change the rules too much for me - i am used to bball this way and changing it like that isn't exactly a slight change in the amount of times out; something tiny like that, but this is quite a frustrating change.

3yvuMkzTaa	Cancer is a terrible disease. I hope he has a full recovery, he is a very talented coordinator.   I don't think his health problems influenced the play on the field. Remember Larry Fitzgerald is perhaps the greatest wide receiver playing the game. Arizona is a very good team on both sides of the ball. That was a good game, & this is coming from a Steeler fan. I was hoping for an all Pennsylvania Super Bowl!!!|`|2RzOqHObaa	it sucks broo  go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|E5habPNsaa	one of the best defensive coordinators in the game.     but no, it was him blitzing way too much. especially against Warner.
ubGNtkHQaa	Big Time....spending a lot of money on ONE player when football is a team sport. Plus their punter has almost as much guaranteed money as the 1st round picks (8-31) in last years draft|`|ymqWa8GNaa	If you think of Al Davis' recent contract extremes as his desire to "get back at" the rest of NFL management, then, and only then, can you understand his recent move.  He is a mixed up, twisted man whose maverick ways were originally (in the 70s) good for the league, and opened up the offensive game.  He has since then moved far beyond maverick status to lunatic fringe, and is likely to get far worse before getting better.|`|1738296cc77006ee52364e11a2b2b669aa	If they don't they will never be able to find a owner for the Raiders after Al dies in the next coupl of years.  Maybe that is what Al wants, wait as a San Fan fan I hope he keeps it up so the Raiders go bankrupt and are forced to fold.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	No, the crazier he gets the closer it gets to an automatic "W" on their schedule.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	They should have a long time ago.
tBuzrlSdaa	It would be cool but I dont want it to happen Shaq will retire soon and it will be a waste for Lakers|`|WUuO6wbAaa	What does it matter to me? I'm not a Lakers fan? lol If I were though, no. One, Shaq's not the same player he was when he was a Laker. He'd contribute, but be a burden once Bynum would get back, although he seems inevitably injury prone, although it's arguable they're better without him, at times. What ever the case is, the idea was to move foward, which took a couple of years, and now they've got a good chance to win a title. Indirectly, at least to Kobe, and the Lakers, Shaq's a trouble-maker. He was perfect for LA, in his prime, because he loved attention and he's entertaining. But at this point, he doesn't seem to be worth much. I remember in the subtitles of the News in ''I am Legend'' it said Shaq would retire in 2010, but it also said the Knicks would win their sixth straight again or something like that lol Plus, would Kobe want to win another title, knowing Shaq would have the satisfaction in saying he couldn't do it without him again? I don't think Kobe will ever win a title, without Shaq, but Shaq wouldn't have helped at this point either way.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	No! I'd like to see Kevin Garnett team up with Tim Duncan one day on the same team, I'd like to see that! LOL Better yet, maybe see Tim Duncan go to the Heat to play with Dwayne Wade once Duncan's contract is up with the Spurs. Now, I'd love to see that! LOL|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Like Romeo and Juliet. No.|`|SuvvJgyOaa	yes i would like to see shaq going back to lakers. he will destroy the chemistry and create tension the same way he did in miami disrespecting stan van gundy and referring to him as some porn guy (as revealed by pat riley early in the season) and destroying the fluid 7 secs or less phoenix offense (although probably it's porter's fault).|`|D8IFcgZAaa	that's not going to happen and as a laker fan it doesn't make much since for the team shaq is not close to the player he once was ----------time to move on.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	no, the hate eachother, im not buying it.<br>  <br>   sure its easy to spend 3 days with him but the whole season and then the playoffs, no, if that happens i see death.|`|ise05jjUaa	I'm sure all the Lakers fans would like that, that way Kobe can win a title on his "own" seeing as how he hasn't won once since Shaq left.  lol|`|fZ38PPgSaa	yes , then no one will care about Boston's big 3 and back to lakers dominate 2|`|vJyF8siJaa	Yes, after Kobe wins a title!|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yes it would I think they will reunite next season.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	shaq is fine right where he is at. relationships last longer when you live apart|`|AA11488609	It won't happen|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	I wan't kobe to win at least one without shaq, then i'll gladly take him back. Shaq is still the most dominant center in the league right now.
4j92pzJxaa	Celtics 116 - 109 Suns|`|czHrQRCOaa	I do not know how many points Suns are gonna win by, but trust me they will! funny how there are so many things going on about the Suns lately. Anyway, Suns will win, somehow! If they go over 140, the crowd will go wild. Anyway, lately in that last game with OKC the suns did amazing, they keep that up we will pound the celtics back to there roots!!!|`|EesutLtWaa	i think it might be a close game <br>  cuz of the absense of KG and Amare <br>  their offense will decrease a little<br>  and i dont think the Suns can score another 140+ point game <br>  clippers do suckk so it might have been a three time thing :)<br>  <br>  but overall i think Boston will win :) <br>  i luv ray allen : )|`|NzrTgpe4aa	Its gonna be close, but I think the Suns barely get this 1.<br>  105-103<br>  Without KG, Celtics got no dominant big man. Since Shaq is still available, he can dominate the Celtics big men. But matching with Paul Pierce and Ray Allen will be a little difficult. Still the Suns will pull off with the win|`|2lImBNRfaa	I hope the Suns can do it. I dont like the Celtics they r too conceited.|`|jA6OZjIGaa	Celtics - 98<br>  Suns - 105|`|0zctdA3iaa	nope sorry kid youre wrong|`|UMVWQiYJaa	sounds good|`|xhHfXuKFaa	celtics 99-88.|`|uxregJ0faa	bold claim after Celtics bust that A.<br>  <br>  But I think it will be interesting. <br>  <br>  Now that Phoenix is back to run and gun its gonna be<br>  Defense vs Offense.

OYYYNCyCaa	the 66 England Team would beat the current team<br>  <br>  why: Gordon Banks<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Current England Team would lose<br>  <br>  why: David James|`|C7A34HFMaa	Almost any modern team could beat a team from 1966 as the players are in much better shape, faster and more skillful.<br>  That said, if you give both teams the benefit of modern training the World Cup winners would beat the current England team because of a better goalie and better and more clinical strikers.|`|wfzgcOHYaa	66 team New England is improving one day they will win the world cup|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Back from Hell made a very good point.<br>  Also, the 66 team played solidly as a unit. We don't.|`|L1QTSErIaa	No la. Players these days are faster, stronger, have more stamina and more astute technical wise. No team from the 60s can match up to the present players. Football has changed. <br>  The game back then had no back pass rule. Those days, players simply pass the ball back to the keeper when in trouble and start all over. They played the game as simple as possible. <br>  Individually, the 66 team had a better crop of players. But as a team, they will be no match for the current team.
dcNT65mTaa	Although a lot of those matches would be great to see, I think u should put together a card that actually is possible with the stars we have  access to, play GM for one night let's say.     Orton-Edge would be a good match but I don't think just the two names together would spark a lot of cheers. It has to be a reason to put 2 heels against each other besides just a title match.     Cena-Jericho has huge potential if they stop with the whole Cena burst of energy to pull off finishers the way they do. It's irritating to watch and I'm sure pisses off more than just me. Mickey Rourke would be a great special guest referee. It keeps his use of celebrities.    Instead of Swagger-RVD, I'd say Swagger-Finlay-Hardy(if they dont decide to send him to SD) in a triple threat ladder match, and if not Hardy than Mark Henry as a replacement.    If your gonna put 1 monster in a match, why not 3, Kane-Kozlov-Umaga for a  1 contenders match.    Rock-Stone Cold would be a great one night-er cept the Rock forgot he was a wrestler.    Undertaker-Shawn Michaels in a retirement match would be a showstopper but the thing about that is someone would have to RETIRE afterwards and do we really wanna lose either one of them with the shortage of superstars.    Money in the Bank match is a sure fire KEEPER!    Melina and Mickie James is a definite good match but something tells me Beth Phoenix wouldn't like it much. I'd say work her in there somehow. Vince doesn't like to limit the diva on screen time. He may limit the action, but not the on screen time.|`|BglekVnQaa	Why would Taker and HBK retire and they are only in their early forties. Plus RVD isn't returning because he's taking care of his wife with cancer and why would Randy go against Edge when he can fight against Cena for a Championship. We don't know how this WM is going to be. We just have to find out later.|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	Where's HHH or Hardy vs. Hardy?|`|LfWghJYeaa	Melina vs Mickie James is a bout the only realistic match there. We all wants HBK vs Taker but it is not gonna happen. The Rock has already said he wont wrestle again. Money in The Bank looks good except for i think that Christan will be returning at Backlash. RVD is retired so not gonna happen. It is a good fantasy card. Not a good realistic one.|`|GKH8n3xzaa	I like your matches a lot better, than what the wwe has right now    but instead of christian in a MITB match and edge vs rko ( i would love to     see this match ) instead i would do christian & edge vs. the hardy boyz  =)    and having stone cold & the rock go at it one more     time..would make my day....for the rest of my life!|`|l0GWmWl4aa	Its definitly a dream card. Orton Vs. Edge is very unlikely seeing as how there has never been a heel vs. heel main event at wrestlemania. Jericho vs. Cena has been over done. RVD at wrestling is doubtful, but look at the royal rumble. Taker vs. HBK in a retirement match is hilarious, but wont happen. And where is HHH? you cant have wrestlemania without Vince's Son-In-Law. And I love them both, but there is no way in hell there will be Austin vs. Rock 4 at wrestlemania. Austin is too banged up and Dwayne Jonhson is too good for wrestling anymore. I like it and wish it was real, but its highly unlikly.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	RVD isnt returning. HBK is bound to be there as it is in Texas. Stone Cold might be there. I highly doubt rocky being there. I like the MITB card though. Probably have 2 from Smackdown 2 from raw and 2 from ECW though. Last year the Money in the Bank had like 8 people aswell.|`|JiCfYfLraa	your wm match card is over the top that will never happen but i do agree that chris jericho is in a stupid match and for sure will lose which is pathetic.|`|it2UVkF4aa	inetivable it will be the most jejune Wrestlemania event.
lkw5ZyDIaa	BJ Benn|`|tQGRJBYAaa	So many are overrated. Kimbo was overrated. LOL. Now everyone has realized he is a street fighter and only that.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Anderson Silva easily, Four losses to guys with 30 losses, and a weak attempt at fighting a guy at LH, Maybe a fight with a guy ranked above 26th would be a start, sure dominating the weakest division is great and everything but in no way the best pound for pound guy, Above him are Fedor, GSP, Torres, even Uriah.|`|LFLflsWFaa	BJ Penn.<br>  <br>  He lives on the same island as me but I can't stand him.|`|a954809e4f18646ae09e77b29aee6dbfaa	There are way too many of them.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Tank Abbott.|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	Brock Lesnar<br>  <br>   and<br>  <br>  Anderson Silva|`|ATh0ciALaa	lol bj penn id gosame brock lesnar
hkzGYQD4aa	Lebron was on fire tonight. He had an awesome game. I'm so excited about having Delonte come back. He is a huge asset and we have definitely missed him! <br>  <br>  GO CAVS!|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	LeBron tries his hardest in every game. He really wants his team to succeed so he does only what he must in order to come away with the win. West is back, maybe the Cavaliers will begin a win streak.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	he actually had a better scorin night in my opinion<br>  he wasnt forcin shots in plus all of them were goin in!<br>  he was actually on fire from his off balanced 3's!<br>  thank goodness we get delonte back!|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	The Bucks made LeBron angry and he was demanding the ball run and then shoot. Don't make LBJ angry!!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Wow He did good. I really hope Delonte starts.|`|fKlZdoPHaa	That was an important win. The Bucks are the team to beat.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ku$h, do you understand sarcasm?<br>  <br>  Ku$h, too many details, too little information :-)|`|jA6OZjIGaa	no, but he wants the Bucks to think that Mo Williams is better with the Cavs than with the Bucks, and how much he improved since Mo arrives at Cleveland|`|NzrTgpe4aa	THANK YOU CAVS!!!! A win over the bucks give the Nets an easier chance to make it to the playoffs. I still cant believe they lost to the wizards by 11 today.... VC was cold all game.

YAY TAY!|`|NmXKPDoIaa	His career high is 56 points, Im suprised he didn't try to break it.|`|HLzS2z9laa	seems like he is gettin his shot on point, its gettin scary for the rest of the league<br>  <br>  he was just tryin to see how hot he can get, and he got pretty f-in hot, 9 assists wit that too, if he did a lil better at the line he could of had a 60, 15-22 not good enough, kobe gets it to 20-22 and packs da 60, lebron will be a beast when his jumper is consistent, its ovaaaaa King James baybaaay
sqfjfR3iaa	OVW and UPW no longer have a direct relationship with World Wrestling Entertainment, only Florida Championship Wrestling does. Randy Orton, John Cena and Dave Batista were among a number of wrestlers who worked at OVW. I think John Cena also worked in UPW. FCW has sent up Jack Swagger, DJ Gabriel, Alicia Fox, DH Smith, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase and many others.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	FCW since they are the wwe's top company.. But OWV produced the most wrestlers such as:Batista big show boogeyman cm punk carlito elijah burke john cena deuce domino kofi kingston john morrison kelly kelly kenny and much more|`|FNxfbmJNaa	If they have a relationship with the wwe they are not entirely "independant". i will say of the three you mentioned: currently fcw. This is wwe's "triple A" club. Younger guys get trained and called up from here such as Ted Debiase jr, Jake hager( jack swagger), manu, etc.  Ovw used to be wwe's farm team and produced most of the "younger" or "newer" main eventers of the last 5 years such as Cena, batista, orton, etc but since they were dropped they may get their guys a deal but will not produce as many "superstars" in the future.  upw would be an indy league compared to those two.|`|mKb0VsHDaa	OVW Because the best talent have come from there like Batista John Cena Orton. Cena was called the prototype. Batista was undefeated for more than a year. And Orton well I dunno about him.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	OVW is no longer associated with WWE, but I liked them the best. They groomed guys like Brock. Shelton, Randy, Cena, Batista ect, and had a great booker in Jim Cornette before he was released.
Cb5N6UaQaa	14 - 14 They win keep playing .500 basketball and miss the playoffs. I have been telling this since a couple of months and no one seems to believe me. I will save this question and smile in June when all this comes to light and everyone will realize I speak the truth. LOL.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	15-13. they can't score 140 every game.|`|uxregJ0faa	Suns should be worrying about making the playoffs. They are without Amare so it will be tough. This win against Thunder does not show anything|`|KTp27Fokaa	Scoring 140 on a couple of awful defensive teams doesn't mean much.<br>  <br>  But they will go 17-11 and capture the 8th spot.|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Yep agree. The Suns are coming back baby!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Without Amare? Come on.|`|czHrQRCOaa	No, 28-0.<br>  if your a true suns fan, you would understand the suns will still have a chance. did u c that suns game against okc thunder, it was a blowout, and suns also became the only team since 1990 to win three games in row over 140 points in each. what if amare is out? big deal! We are gonna take it all home! Also, just because they played a bad team or not doesn't mean anything. Its how the players actually reacted! LB scored 41. J-Rich 34. ONeal 22. You don't get those numbers from those guys so often, and if they keep that up the Suns will be unstopable.|`|qOgdJEMOaa	Dammmnn..

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Don't know any details, but you could give them a call:  LA Boxing Of Lexington  231 E Brannon Rd   Nicholasville, KY 40356  (859) 245-5269  http://www.laboxing.com/lexington/defaul...    I believe you can come take a free class as a trial. Ask when you call.
WkpOrF64aa	No, it is a draft pick that OKC had received in a trade, it is not the one that they are "earning," now.<br>  <br>  It'll be in the late teens, early 20's, I think.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  OKC has two ADDITIONAL  first round picks.  One from Denver (Johan Petro trade) #25 in the draft and one from San Antonio (Kurt Thomas trade), #26 in the draft.<br>  <br>  The pick won't be high, anywhere from #23-#27, I should think.|`|fPMmN2p5aa	Because the Thunder own the first-round picks of the Nuggets and Suns, the Bulls will receive the lesser of those two picks.  So now we gotta wait to see how the lottery pans out.  Should be interesting...|`|0zctdA3iaa	i thought okc had more than 1 1st round pick<br>  <br>  if not then thats pretty st00pid for them hehehe|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Maybe their 2nd first round draft pick right!|`|V03f8tmMaa	Ya I think so and I think if they dont make the playoffs the bulls could have another 1 pick
ZAh8CEoGaa	Yes LeBron was feeling it tonight and no one should ever question his jumper ever again. He didn;t just score 55 he also dished that much assists and grabs some rebounds. Even this is better than Kobe's 62. That fight was good. Though Varejao was too soft on that shoved in the face. Villanueva cannot be that strong.|`|apY85Qmtaa	Was quite a game. Obviously we weren't gonna win but it was great nonetheless. LeBron is one of my fave players outside the Bucks so it was nice to see him beasting. Too many missed FT's for the Bucks though, one of the reasons we lost.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	yep<br>  let lebron take over,plus it was a pure offense game :)<br>  one of the best cavs game in a while<br>  the fight was also entertainin :D|`|F65Km3Coaa	yeah,but Big Z was right for what he did,when delonte gets back watch out|`|u1fK5CuNaa	Lebrons 7th 50 point game of the season.

d9WoAeeIaa	ok this board is good for every level of snowbaording becouse of its softer flex that it has. so it will give you more forgivness than like an all moutain board. i even looked into one of these but it was little to stiff for the jibbing that i do. i am riding a Never Summer EVO. thsi board is great all around and has nice flex to it. also in a cuple weeks i am geting the Step Child Latch Key vary nice flex to the board up there with the K2 WWW and Rome Artifact.

Go speedo (I would) primarily but if you don't want to, go square cut. They are both probably equally efficient.|`|bza3rVG9aa	All three are perfectly fine for starters.

ZbNXVQu7aa	Hawkeye, this question never said anything about Jim Cornette being a wrestler (although I have yet to see the YouTube clip, so I don't know what's in it).<br>  <br>  Kold Kase, Jim Cornette is not the Mouth of the South.  I think you have him mixed up with Jimmy Hart.<br>  <br>  As far as the original question goes, I think JBL has the bigger mouth than Jim Cornette, but Jimmy Hart has the biggest mouth in all of wrestling.  If anyone can find a wrestling personality with a bigger mouth than Jimmy Hart, I'd like to know who that is.|`|ZDuIhDyDaa	Cornett! Of coarse, he's the mouth of the south! Ever wonder why they call him that, hmmm. Does he go south with the mouth!|`|UlXBL8tbaa	JBL has the bigger mouth in my opinion..

83ebpB19aa	They are things you can edit that affect the gameplay. Like you can set 3 pointers to 100 in Game Sliders, and you'll make 100% of your threes (excluding long shots). It basically let's you customize your game to your likings.
yk4S7uuraa	As a Mets' fan, I remember that World Series, and Willie Mays was at the end of his career. He probably would not have played the outfield if Rusty Staub didn't hurt his shoulder in Game 4 of the NLCS. He missed Game 5 of the NLCS and Games 1 and 2 of the World Series. <br>  At that time, the only throws Willie Mays could make was to get the ball to Bud Harrelson in the infield, he couldn't throw to the plate anymore and couldn't run well. <br>  <br>  I saw his last appearance at the plate it was in Game 4 of the Series in Shea, where he popped up. The Mets won that Game 5-1, Jon Matlak started.<br>  <br>  I remember how I felt the day the Mets got Willie Mays in May of 1972. I remember hearing Lindsey Nelson on TV, when Willie had his first AB in a Mets' uniform... "...if you were here from the beginning, and all of the loosing and the days in the Polo Grounds, just the sight of this man in your team's uniform has to do something to you..."<br>  <br>  I remember the 1973 World Series, and just wish it had a different ending.

I think HBK will beat Kozlov's undefeated streak to hype up the match at wrestlemania because shawn can say that he beat someone taker couldn't. Also wrestlemania is supposed to be epic why would wwe recycle a match done like 6 weeks ago. It would be stupid and nobody would be interested. This is their 25th anniversary they need to make this wrestlemnia the best they can and the only way that's going to happen is if HBK vs the Undertaker.
1OeNP92yaa	no dumb question|`|CxlU410Uaa	No - look for other deals. Rasheed's productivity has started to decline over the last month and half.     Felton has played well with Augustin's absense and LA has been solid. I'd be patient and look to get more value for those two players.
cdQryr7paa	You hit the nail right on the head buddy.<br>  There are a lot of people on here that can dish it out but can't take it.<br>  Or else they are so sensitive they can't take a little difference of opinion.<br>  If you can't take the heat, stay out of the Q/A kitchen.|`|4KTe107Yaa	There was a time when EVERY question I asked in here got reported.

It is just way to easy for someone to report. They need absolutely no legit reason at all. I have been here for over a year now and I can honestly say that I have never reported anyone.

NR5LhOpPaa	Play style is a better indicator for racquet fit than size.  You should only get the extended length if you know you can handle it.  The length gives extra power, but does take away from the control of the frame.    If you already don't have problems with control, then the extra length would probably be fine.  But if you are spraying balls all over the place with a standard length frame, you probably should stay away from the extended length.    Other than that, though, it should be fine.  If it's available to your area, I strongly suggest demoing the racquet first.  tenniswarehouse.com will ship demos anywhere in the US. The demo is free, but you pay shipping.  If you demo from TW, you can get up to 4 frames at a time, so it's more worth the cost to get 4 at once.  If you do that, demo the regular length and extended length versions to see which you prefer.  You might also try a couple other frames just for fun.|`|B07sKfdvaa	It's a good stick...but they make a lot of good sticks.  You'll be pleased if you get out there and use it!  Of course, you'll make most look good if you practice enough.  Seriously, though, it's a good competition level|`|JD40e1Sdaa	How good are you and what kind of game to you play or want to play?  I find that the racquet is very easy to serve with.  However I don't particularly care for the way it plays on off center hits, not too stable.  The open string pattern is nice for generating spin.  Its does vibrate a bit, so a damper (or rubber band) is a good idea.|`|qFLgBIP7aa	well.... depends really. did you try any other racquets? its highly personal.    That racquet is very powerful and offers some boom on the serve as well as groundstrokes.    That racquet is very stiff. if you play with polyester strings and that raquet with an arm thats prone to injury then most likely it is not the way to go.    I play babolat and like it alot. I say babolat is a winner (for my style)|`|W3F7xeF5aa	Babolat is a very good make period. I don't think you can go wrong|`|Bpt3Kgnhaa	that is a good racket if you r lookin for all the power in the world but it has poor controlibility|`|bsG2smjWaa	tht racket isnt the best babolat racket u shuld consider getting a pure storm limited or a head pretige or the ksixone. those all have gud control. ur 5'11 so u can probably supply the power on ur own so jus luk for those rackets.|`|YKDhstvkaa	no dude get prince.|`|qFIicrunaa	okay, i personally have never used the raquet, but  i think that unless you have a game very similar to Roddick's you should keep looking around. try to look into Prince EXO series, if you are good, and if you are not great look into the Prince O2 Hybrid.
h9PVRHPWaa	lol. damn brandon has pissed you off man. Got to agree with you though. It kind of gets old hearing. "Who is the greatest of all time Stone Cold or The Rock" or "Why can`t we go back to the attitude era".          But to answer your question I don`t think so. From what I remember about JYD he didn`t really have the whole Bodybuilder body that vince just loves. He just had a big football player body. Personally he was my fav as a kid and was a better entertainer than Hogan ever was. I`m pretty sure I watched him in the old UWF/Mid South.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Correct me if I'm wrong here but wasn't junkyard dog with the WWE when Hogan was with AWA? if that was the case Junkyard dog could well have got the push hogan did at the time, he was just as good of a wrestler can could have done the same job for wrestling. You can never be sure with these things but i think the dog had the right tools for the job.|`|3icTrKLLaa	I bet Brandon is a 14 year old who first saw wrestling in 2005.

I am guessing somebody named Brandon hacked your user name......either way you are an idiot    Oh, sorry...i enjoy the sarcasm. Brandon is an idiot. and to answer your question....i think if WWE new how to use talent better, JYD could have been the big star. I don't think it had anything to do with race however.|`|AA11482019	JYD is a legend.  He was one of the biggest stars of the NWA in the early 1980's.

LFLflsWFaa	If you want it, you'll get it. It's how much you want it that counts.<br>  <br>  6 pack abs looks good but they're not as important to me. Though if it's for yourself, you're going to have to do more than wave around your black belt.<br>  <br>  Swim. Run. Yoga. Stretch. Push-ups. Sit-ups.<br>  <br>  Men have it a lot easier than women to get abs so consider yourself lucky. Oh and watch what you eat. Since you have a belly you have to trim down the fat by running 30 minutes everyday but be sure to do the sit ups BEFORE running. After running will make things painful. <br>  <br>  Remember, too much of anything isn't good. Unless you build up a high metabolism; you're going to have a difficult time. <br>  <br>  You really have to watch what you eat. Like seriously calorie count. (To me that's hell itself.) Best of luck.|`|szcA8CDyaa	Do couple of sit ups everyday and when you get use to it, trust me, you'll have 4 pack and when you can do more than 100, you'll have 6 pack like me. lol.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep up with your effort.=]|`|fRosDAZEaa	6 packs are had by reducing your body fat percentage so that you can see your abs.

But here's what happened. 14-4 Pittsburgh was a 7-point favorite over the Arizona Cardinals. Pittsburgh was going for a record sixth Super Bowl title, while Arizona was trying to get their 1st. In the first quarter, led by Big Ben Roethlisberger at QB, the Steelers marched down to the Arizona 1, but was denied on three straight plays, so the Steelers only came away with a field goal.  Steelers 3, Arizona 0.  Arizona was shut down on their first drive. In the second quarter, Pitt running back Willy Parker rammed into the end zone to increase the lead.  Steelers 10, Arizona 0.  But the Cardinals struck back, as they moved down the field led by QB Kurt Warner, and scored on a 1-yard pass from Warner to a tight end (I didn't know his name).  Steelers 10, Arizona 7.  Near the end of the second quarter, Arizona was all the way inside the Steelers' 5 with :18 left in the first half. But Warner made a bad play, as he threw it right into Pittsburgh linebacker Rodney Harrison's hands and he returned it 100 yards on the final play of the half to increase the lead.  Steelers 17, Arizona 7, HALFTIME  Thanks to some dumb penalties by their defense, the Cardinals let Pitt go down to the 3 yard line. But the Cards held their ground there and held Pittsburgh to a field goal.  Steelers 20, Arizona 7, START OF 4TH QUARTER  But here comes Arizona in the 4th. On the 8th play of their drive, Warner finds star receiver Larry Fitzgerald in the end zone to cut the lead down.  Steelers 20, Arizona 14  A coupla of minutes later, Pittsburgh made a big mistake. Backed up at their own 1 and being 3rd down and 11, Roethlisberger found San Antonio Holmes for a first down. But Pitt was called for holding in the endzone, automatically giving Arizona 2 points and the ball with 2:57 left in the game.  Steelers 20, Arizona 16  Only 20 seconds later, Warner found Larry Fitzgerald again, this time on a 64-yard TD pass to give them the lead with 2:34 left to go.  Arizona 23, Steelers 20  But the Steelers' offense had time to move. Ben Roethlisberger found San Antonio Holmes for a 40-yard gain that moved them to the Cardinals' 7 yard line with under a minute to go. 2 plays later, Ben found San Antonio Holmes in the corner of the end zone for a Game-Changing TD with :35 seconds to go. Warner and the Cardinals had a slim chance, but Pittsburgh recovered a fumble by Warner with :05 left and won the game in a nail-biter.  Steelers 27, Cardinals 23, FINAL
x9GODf8eaa	1. It actually depends on who is in the box already. I am going to quote the rule book, because it gives a good explanation.<br>  <br>  One team is already shorthanded when the two penalties happen:<br>  When coincident minor penalties or<br>  coincident minor penalties of equal duration are imposed against<br>  players of both teams, the penalized players shall all take their places<br>  on the penalty benches and such penalized players shall not leave the<br>  penalty bench until the first stoppage of play following the expiry of<br>  their respective penalties. Immediate substitution shall be made for an<br>  equal number of minor penalties or coincident minor penalties of equal<br>  duration to each team so penalized and the penalties of the players<br>  for which substitutions have been made shall not be taken into<br>  account for the purpose of the delayed penalty rule (Rule 27). This<br>  rule only applies when at least one team is already serving a time<br>  penalty in the penalty box that causes them to be short-handed.<br>  <br>  Basically it is saying that play will remain 5 on 4 as it was before the penalties.<br>  <br>  If nobody is in the box already:<br>  When one minor penalty is assessed to one player or goalkeeper<br>  of each team at the same stoppage in play, these penalties will be<br>  served without substitution provided there are no other penalties in<br>  effect and visible on the penalty clocks. Both teams will therefore play<br>  four skaters against four skaters for the duration of the minor<br>  penalties.<br>  <br>  So if it is 5 on 5 when the penalties happen, play goes to 4 on 4 and the players come out as soon as their time expires.|`|UkW9FPEZaa	1) When two players get penalties in the same sequence of play but the two penalties are not matching. Ex: one player gets a 2 minute charging penalty and the other get's a two minute triping Obstruction penalty would result in a 4 on 4 for 2 minutes.<br>  2) No the 4on 4 will continue until the remainder of the penalty is finished.

Eat the right foods, and make sure you give your stomach time to digest them before trainings and games.<br>  <br>  As a goalkeeper, you'd need to work at jumps and perfect your eggbeater. Make sure you do at least 10 - 20 single arm jumps with each arm, and about 15 with both arms. Work on using your legs to lift you out of the water while doing eggbeater. Swim laps of eggbeater keeping your hands dry. Variations of this include elbows dry, hands on head and hands on the ball on your head.

Z4ek79ZCaa	Learn to dribble with your head up. Dribble. Dribble. Dribble. Practice using only your left hand for everything: dribbling, shooting, lay-ups; so that you can be ambidextrous when needed. Don't pick up your dribble or leave your feet when you get locked down (heavily guarded). Chest pass medicine balls OR find a wall to bounce a basketball off, face wall and then turn to your entire body to the right at a profile, turn  your waist toward the wall and chest pass as hard as you can to wall, letting it bounce back to you in a smooth motion, turn to other side, turn at your waist and repeat. For a conditioning exercise: Pick the right side of the backboard, jump up and throw ball at backboard, then jump up again quickly enough to grab ball and throw back at backboard before you land, jump up and down catching and throwing back up while in mid-air three times; then back up to the top right of the paint, dribble as fast as you can and lay-up properly to right side. Repeat jumping exercise on left side of backboard; then lay-up as fast as you can (sprinting) on left side. This is one rep- start off doing 10 reps for a conditioning exercise. Study Steve Nash.|`|1q67udZKaa	Study some videos of great guards. Steve Nash, Isiah Thomas, Bob Cousy, John Stockton, Jerry West, Derek Fisher and Gary Payton all come to mind.<br>  <br>  Above all, practice and never let anyone tell you that you can't do it.

The young talent is poised to take it to the next level.<br>  <br>  The rest is pretty straightforward.  I wasn't big on the 49ers, but when I saw where you put them, it made sense.  I think the Cards will have the classic SuperBowl hangover and struggle a bit, but still snatch a playoff spot.  I also agree that the Eagles should be strong, despite a tough division.  The Saints win their division with the classic last-to-first jump that division has seen every year this decade.  I also see a bounce back from the Browns, the Ravens will fall back.
ZbNXVQu7aa	Randy Orton would win because Orton "in his prime" would be in the future, whereas Edge "in his prime" is right now and Benoit "in his prime" was at least 4 years ago, and Orton right now is at least on the same level as Edge is and Benoit was.<br>  <br>  Is Punk using the GTS or a better finisher?  If he's using the GTS, Morrison wins by countering that into the Moonlight Drive.  Otherwise, Punk wins by countering the Moonlight Drive into Punk's "better finisher" (possibly the Pepsi Plunge I've heard so much about but never actually seen?).  Either way, both superstars are just beginning to enter their prime, so we might see the answer for ourselves in the next few years.<br>  <br>  In their prime, both Undertaker and Kane were unstoppable solo forces.  Put them together in their prime, and the outcome looks bleak for D-X.  I'm hoping the D-X representatives are Triple H and X-Pac because those are the two I most want to see annihilated and/or obliterated by the Brothers of Destruction.<br>  <br>  Can I take a cop-out and say that outside interference would enable Kurt to win this one?  If not, I'm still giving Kurt the victory, with the following ending: Angle Slam is countered into a Stone Cold Stunner, which in turn is countered into the Angle Lock, at which point Kurt grapevines Stone Cold's leg and forces the Rattlesnake to tap out.<br>  <br>  Are you serious with this last one?  Trish in her prime wouldn't be a match for Chyna at any point in her career.  Putting Chyna in her prime would guarantee the 9th Wonder of the World a victory over any woman wrestler who was at one time associated with WWE (and, if not for Awesome Kong, Chyna in her prime would dominate any woman wrestler I've ever seen compete).|`|4YcZv0d7aa	Chris Benoit would pin Orton. Benoit would give a flying headbut to Edge, rendering him unconscious and Benoit rolls out of the ring. Orton would then crouch down as if preparing for an RKO. While he's down and crouched, Benoit slides in the ring behind Orton and gets him with the Crippler Crossface.<br>  <br>  Punk would pin Morrison after the GTS.<br>  <br>  Brothers of Destruction would do a simultaneous chokeslam then Tombstone Piledriver. Of course the match would go back and forth for around 10 minutes. <br>  <br>  This one's a tough one actually.<br>  Stone Cold would win after Kurt Angle attempts the Angle Slam but Austin slides out. Then Stone Cold kicks Angle in the stomache and a Stunner. 3 count then on to the beer swilling. Then he pours beer on Angle while still out cold.<br>  <br>  Trish Stratus would win by being much faster, kicking Chyna's legs, and giving the "Chick Kick" to Chyna while she is on her knees. Finishing her off with "Stratusfaction".|`|YwEFJWR7aa	Randy Orton<br>  Cm Punk<br>  Brothers of Destruction<br>  Stone Cold<br>  Trish Stratus|`|0P40aUA0aa	Chris Benoit<br>  CM Punk<br>  D-X<br>  Kurt Angle<br>  Chyna|`|3k4tPNTGaa	chris benoit (coz he is best technical wrestler of all time)<br>  cm punk (coz he is better)<br>  brothers of destruction (undertaker and kane united, dx cnt gt the win)<br>  stone cold ofcourse (he is one of d best wrestler of all time)<br>  chyna (no lady wrestler cn stand in front of chyna , beth cn give her a gud compition)|`|YGnE5bNOaa	1) Chris Benoit he will make Edge tap out<br>  2) CM Punk puts John Morrison asleep<br>  3)DX they do there tag team finisher Sweet Chin Music into a pedigree but Kane gets pinned<br>  4)Stone Cold he will brake his jaw instead of Angle brakin is ankle<br>  5)Trish Stratus she will finish Chyna of with the Stratusfaction and become new Women's Champion LOL (I kno trish has retired)|`|zNajmAYFaa	1.} Chris Benoit.<br>  2.} Heh, "The Shaman of Sexy" John Morrison. {Favorite Wrestler{<br>  3.} Brothers of Destruction!<br>  4.} Stone Cold<br>  5.} Trish|`|GTuSPTDDaa	Whomever was scheduled to win based on a variety of factors but decided by the people booking the matches... possibly modified by wrestlers that have good "pull" backstage.|`|TUURiVnraa	orton<br>  punk<br>  dx<br>  stone cold<br>  trish <br>  <br>  <br>  lol kewl matches|`|l1kMNykGaa	Edge<br>  Punk<br>  D-X<br>  Stone Cold<br>  Trish Stratus|`|t0bx27bVaa	Benoit<br>  CM Punk<br>  DX<br>  Stone Cold<br>  Trish|`|TOKgPsdOaa	Orton<br>  Punk<br>  D-generation X<br>  Angle<br>  Chyna<br>  <br>  Those would all be great matches thought! good choices|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Randy Orton<br>  CM Punk<br>  Brothers of Destruction<br>  Kurt Angle<br>  Trish Stratus|`|4tvI9WYjaa	randy orton<br>  cm punk<br>  kane and taker<br>  stone cold <br>  trish stratus

nxymxSUFaa	I've always said that if Joe Willie Namath can make it to the hall of fame than certainly any QB that has put up like numbers and won a SB can make it.  The fact is Kurt Warner's number are far better than Namath.  Yes, I would have no problem if Warner made it.  He is clearly a class act and good things should happen to good people.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Im not sure, in the modern day, he has posted good enough cumulative stats (TDs, yards, etc).   Even though he has bested Aikman in many categories, who is in, he doesnt have Aikmans multiple rings to help him out.    I say, he either has to play at least 2 more years posting similiar stats as this year, or, he has to win another superbowl.    Without that, he might just find himself left out of the hall.|`|UxooffHZaa	I think so. Perhaps I'm caught up in the Euphoria of the moment, but hey, he's a HOFer. It's about Fame, after all.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Eventually, yes...Maybe not first ballot...but he will...    People aren't considering that like in '98 or '97, he was bagging groceries...He won the Super Bowl with a good Rams team and almost won it with an average Cardinals team...He's a damn HOFer...|`|sS5abD8Vaa	If Warren Moon made it Warner should definitely make it|`|69bp1IMfaa	No|`|tNerdFYsaa	NO WAY! any QB could throw for 30 TD"s with that receiving crew|`|JH9IMMDtaa	most definitely!

If Leinart wasn't such a bust Warner wouldn't even be starting now...He even lost his starting job to mini-Manning in New York.  He's definitely not a HOF-caliber QB.|`|CO2o0YYMaa	Yes, he will make the Hall of Fame. Without a doubt.|`|PVMsr2Faaa	Good possibility.

WgTKHqlnaa	I totally agree with this. Everytime someone bumps someone else they all have to crowd around and fight a little about it. I think it does take away from the pace of the game.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	So you think NOBODY should be suspended?Simon stepping on a player?No?The hits from behind?No?The blatant elbows?No still?    Should Marty McSorley have been suspended for his hit on Brashear?How aboot Bertuzzis hit on Moore where he almost paralyzed him?    You do know Rocket Richard was suspended as well?He hit an official,is that okay to do as well?    So,no I disagree it's becoming a babys sport.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Suspending someone for intent to injure is not part of the baby-fication of the sport.    It's still a very tough, physical game.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Back in the 60s and 70s players were suspended for dirty hits, there were usually about 10-15 suspensions a year, usually for 1 or 2 games.    Even in the 60s if you laid out someone like Jean Beliveau or Henri Richard, you suddently had to deal with John Ferguson or Dave Balon.  With Chicago is someone hit Hull or Mikita, you ended up dealing with someone else.    Hockey players have always stuck up for one another.  You can see this when the NHL network shows the odd regular season game from the 60s    In 1963-64, there were 48 suspensions handed down by Clarence Campbell for 'objectionable hits' to 46 players totalling 50 games.      In 1975-76, there were 103 suspensions handed out to 97 players totalling 119 games.    Suspensions sort of disappeared during the Ziegler/O'Neill era was 281 suspensions handed out over a 16 year period or about 18 a year.      Panthers fopr the Playoffs - Ovechkin said he fell, that Chara never touched him (which we all know to be false).  Hard to suspend a guy when the recipient (who was heading for the boards anyway) won't lay blame.|`|6RVBOKTfaa	what if you were playing and someone just came up and smashed you into the boards before you get the puck or someone comes up and cracks you in the head with a stick, would you complain or would you just get up and be like "oh nice swing there, even though you just knocked out my teeth, im not a wuss ill just get up" no you probably would complain.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	I think hockey is perfectly fine!|`|WzjvjW59aa	Calm down.  No one can understand what you're saying.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	Blame goes to Gary Bettman, the wuss of a commissioner...|`|jwPf5rsiaa	You obviously don't know the game very well.|`|HsJiUVkYaa	your obviously not a  "hockey fan". say your a caps fan and say big chara leaves his feet to charge ovechkin. ovechkin is knocked out cold, put on the shelf for 4 weeks from concussions then post concussion symtoms. should chara be able to keep playing? hell no, a 2 game suspension should be handed out.    EDIT: LITY lol was just a senario, had nothing to do with the actuall recent incident :)|`|AA10068004	So dirty hits to you are part of the game but a fight or scrum are not (as you stated they slow the game)? How does a guy getting knocked silly not slow the game? Trainers and/or players almost always have to come out and tend to them after they suffer a cheap shot or hard hit.     Also, fighting and players getting in a scrum after such plays is part of the game and has been since the earliest days of the game. Belongs just as much as a player keeping his head up. If one does not like it find a new sport. I think what is more embarrasing are all the whinny fans complaining about fighting or league officials, or demanding unrealistic changes to the game. I go to every Blackhawks home game. That does not make me entitled to demand change. I pretty much knew what I was getting in to when I became a fan and bought my tickets.  While we can make changes to the game to increase offense, or excitement we are not going to turn it in to golf on ice for some Johnny-come-latelys or long-time fans wanting to be arm-chair commissioners. Nor should we turn it in to a cheap shot filled event where the other team must simp;y turn the other cheek to ya know...keep play moving.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	I'm not sure what you're trying to say.   The league has too many fights or not enough dirty hits?  When Gordie Howe threw an elbow he didn't have it wrapped up in bulletproof polymer plastic.  Exactly how do you find the puck laying on the ice, in the corner, without looking down at some point?  Do you think some of the greats would be better known if they spent the bulk of their career on the IR list?  If a guy throws a dirty hit with the intent of injuring another player, he deserves to get punched out for it, otherwise it would turn into roller derby on ice. A team full of Sean Avery's would dominate a team full of Ovechkins on the ice but who would buy tickets? That's where it would get embarrassing.|`|Icze35Nqaa	Is your name Denis Gauthier?  ; )|`|AA12162118	Because the world as a whole is becoming a group of politically correct pansies.|`|s5FZhPHYaa	We can all tell you don't play hockey!!!|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	the only time there is a big fight is when there is a DIRTY hit. If there is a big clean check, nothing goes on. And if you are talking about the red wings andreas lilja hit, well yes it was a hit from behind but they NEVER call them and and it shouldn't of been a suspension, but they do it all the time so it isn't a baby sport. And howe and all the old-timers weren't as strong as some players in the leauge nowadays. Hockey is one of the most toughest sports out there, pal.
ydoIYwGTaa	I have been hearing the same rumors but there is no truth to it. The only other rumor I have heard is that Feb 27th will be the preorder date for the game in both places but it is still coming out in May.

That has never been a problem for Daytona, as the track pretty much gets to do what it wants from the locals..  Sunday afternoon is sports time, Sunday evening is for dinner with family...  And they wonder why they are losing fans..  I have to work the next day, so do many others, but a race ending between eight, and nine, plus three to four hours in traffic, trying to get to the interstate, and three hours home, is more of a hassle than I need..  They are trying so hard, and doing everything the can to attract left coast fans, so they can pay for Fontana.. It won't work..  What they will accomplish is to alienate their traditional east coast fan base..  People like that amaze me.. "Big" Bill France would have put someone new in charge of thinking, somebody who knows what folks need ..They come for the Florida sun...  And they aren't sitting in a cozy suite like Brian France, being served food, and drinks, instead of standing in line for a hot coffee, dancing back, and forth, and trying to tuck their chin into their collar just trying to keep warm, and enjoy the vacation they saved for all year..  Latest weather for Tuesday night, and Wednesday night and Thursday morning.. The whole State of Florida from NWS: Freeze Alert extending as far south as Miami where they have a Winter Storm Alert..

This is all mainly geared to garner precious Nielson points ratings. Remember that february is a viewer "sweeps" month that sets the stage for advertising costs. The top network can command the highest prices for advertising slots. Fox is really bad about denying the viewer "real-time race coverage" in lieu of fulfilling corporate advertising time slots. The really bad part of all this is that the viewer has to indure repeated commercials, at the expense of real-time major on track action. To add to all this is-competing networks will air one-time major movie events that dare to pull you into them. All I can say, is that, warm-up your vcr's and your dvr's to record what you wish to see later.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Some of the drivers were talking about how much better the racing becomes in the evening after the sun goes down that NASCAR may have adjusted the schedule to make the race more exciting. In an article I read the other day Dale Jr was talking about how the new car's design punches a bigger hole in the the air as also was mentioned by other drivers. What this has created is a situation where use to cars would be on the outside and another line of cars would be on the inside. With the older cars a third line of cars could come up the middle and work their way through traffic.     Well with the new cars it seems that the inside lane went away because of the design of the front splitter and how it punches a larger hole in the air. Well what was noticed is that when the sun went down the racing seemed to improve some. I guess it makes it easier to pass when it's cooler. So what NASCAR may have done ... and this is just my opinion ... is move more of the race toward the night to increase the excitement in the race. I'm sure the way the economy is  NASCAR would want to squeeze every bit of excitement out of the races as they can and with so much negative remarks floating around on the INTERNET these days about the COT it would seem that and easy way to remove some of that negative feedback would be to change the race times on toward the evening and night time to maybe make it a little more exciting.    This is just my opinion. It's only something to think about.|`|op9iJRvBaa	It does seem late but that will allow my son to get his nap in (trying to look at the bright side).|`|AA11971891	That is a suprise, I think it is a little late.|`|tTVS5oYzaa	The past few seasons the Daytona 500 has started in the late afternoon and finished under the lights.  NASCAR pushed back the start time so that its biggest race would finish at night to add to the excitement as well as make prime viewing time for the entire country (not just the east coast).  That is of course driven heavily by television sponsors which pay for their ad spots at prices second only to the Super Bowl.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	I won't miss my nap this year starting at 3 nap time is 2 I LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ki32DDXMaa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! these days the Daytona 500 is ending at NIGHT! i mean i like night races epically restrictor plate races but this is the Daytona 500 not the Coke Zero 500!! with the Daytona 500 ending at night it takes out the meaning of the 500. bottom line with the Daytona 500 ending at night it just does not seam like the Daytona 500, it seams like the Coke Zero 500|`|AA10431326	I enjoy racing under the lights.

ymqWa8GNaa	Depends on the position.  <br>  <br>  A middle linebacker is primarily responsible for tackle-to-tackle run or pass coverage, and pursuit of the ball after that is satisfied. He keys off of the QB on pass plays and identifying and filling the gap that emerges during running plays. He deepens his pass drop based on the number of steps in the QB's drop and the defensive scheme (blitz, straight-up coverage, variants of these) based on the offensive formation the opposition is in, and down and distance.<br>  <br>  Outside linebackers key off of the tight end and in traditional offensive settings, and if he blocks down, look for running plays outside the tackle. If he runs a route, or releases a block to run a route, then the outside linebacker is responsible for the outside short zone diagonal flank coverage. The strong side OL is typically more of a pass coverage specialist, while the weak side OL is expected to be highly proficient in putting pressure on the passer (except in the most conservative defenses). <br>  <br>  The inside or middle LBs tend to be more focused on the fullback, and the OLs more on the tailback, as the fullback is not a frequent ballcarrier outside the tackles.  <br>  <br>  All linebackers are most successful when they have an above-average ability to use their peripheral vision and "feel" the play developing, have quickness as much as speed, and are big hitters who not only deliver impact on contact, but wrap up and put the runner down.  They perform best when they are fully aware of down and distance tendencies of the offense they're up against, and position themselves accordingly.  Mixing in the appropriate percentage of stunts and blitzes keeps the offense off balance, and helps to pressure them to play the defense's game, rather than their own.  The great linebackers are prepared for everything, but have a sixth sense for observing and identifiying the other team's "tells" and indicators of the play to come. Study film for as much time as you're allowed, and you'll see instant impact on your game.  Work on your explosiveness with your arms and legs, which aids in (arms) keeping people off of your core, and (legs) delivering high impact hits.  When shedding blocks, hit and remain free of contact.  On tackles, run completely through the player you're hitting, keeping your feet moving at all times.  A slight "lift" as you move through them, allows you to land hard on the ballcarrier after taking away their feet.<br>  <br>  Go get 'em!|`|rLTHQWeEaa	well each line backer has a gap or outside containment it depends on the scheme or sometimes have to drop back in coverage|`|wPKUl3CTaa	The Main task in a 4-4 and a 4-3 defense is that Each linebacker clogs the 4 gaps on the offensive line 2 on the inside and two on the outside gaps and tackle the ball carrier. The secondary task it to defend the pass.
lp4wajLxaa	These are the 2 best NFL teams in the world<br>  <br>  Green Bay Packers - 12 Championships<br>  Chicago Bears - 9 Championships<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yes the Steelers have won the most SUPER BOWLS, but not the most CHAMPIONSHIPS.  They would be my 3rd pick.  I am a Bears fan, but I am basing my answer solely on the championships that have been won by an organization.|`|9f15OV0Naa	DA BEARS DA BEARS DA BEARS DA BEARS!!!!!!|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	the atl falcons|`|AA11502346	That honorable distinction goes to the Lions of Detroit, MI.  With their stellar offense and defense, they managed to claw their way to the top with an undefeated record of 16-0 and...no wait....that's 0-16.  Sorry, my bad.<br>  <br>  The best NFL team in the world is clearly the San Diego Chargers.  ::applause::|`|nltFZcuGaa	well theres only 32 options lol. ill pick the colts since their my favorite american team.|`|dFAbkSWkaa	pittsburgh steelers<br>  6 superbowl rings<br>  no one else has that many|`|wPKUl3CTaa	I gotta go with the Steelers they have won the most Super Bowls|`|Pw4sfCZVaa	The best NATIONAL football league team in the WORLD?<br>  <br>  Whats the best country in the state?<br>  <br>  The best NFL team in the country : my favorite are the skins<br>  <br>  the best franchise I'd say Patriots, although I am not a fan. Infact quite the contrary.|`|vnzSTerjaa	USA: pittsburgh steelers<br>  <br>  world: the australia platypuses|`|ZP122J4Uaa	TB Buccaneers!!!
oMSTg5rQaa	Let's all assume he's talking about Kobe and Lebron...LOL<br>  <br>  I think either player A or a third candidate should should win, much like the year Tim Duncan won it over Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant in the 2002-03 season.|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	I would say Player B. MVP is chosen when someone good but shows leadership on a bad team. 50 wins ain't bad but player B seems the leader.|`|V03f8tmMaa	Well I think whoever has the best record and is the reason for their team record|`|Fh0shlVLaa	Wade for mvp.|`|czHrQRCOaa	It kind of depends on stats and also how people like that player. More people liked Kobe last year, even though Lebron was averaging better stats. Kobe was right behind him, but people knew that the Lakers can hit a playoff run. Thats pretty much how, so for us we will not know until the end of the regular season.|`|NzrTgpe4aa	Player A because their talent led to more wins. Stats dont matter, if youve looked at past MVP's. Last year Lebron had better numbers than Kobe. But Kobe had the wins. Kobe got MVP.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Player A. Aka Kobe Bryant|`|KHWV4bX3aa	Player A. They had more wins.|`|pNyDKLioaa	Player A and B<br>  <br>  They can be co-mvp just like Kobe and Shaq|`|0zctdA3iaa	i think steve nash|`|4j92pzJxaa	doesn't matter<br>  <br>  LEBRON IS MVP|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	There are too many factors that are not counted into this formula. In what division do they play?<br>  Who won when they played against each other?<br>  Where those wins convincent?<br>  Which player demonstrated more skill and leadership in the key and clutch moments throughout the season?<br>  What is the team's dinamic on the court?<br>  Do him make his teammates better?<br>  <br>  From the looks of it, I would go with Player A. He does have more wins.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Probably whoever sees like they are giving it all at the end on season
0zctdA3iaa	barry bonds???|`|4j92pzJxaa	Rafer Alston.<br>  He had jersey 36, with no name.<br>  This is because he just joined the Magic yesterday.|`|jA6OZjIGaa	Rafer Alston<br>  <br>  i think u will get the same answers for this question :)|`|5Qns2JyFaa	Rafer Alston
k8YSuKGpaa	Most likely (Unfortunately)|`|bSsBGrZVaa	Yeah i think that Edge should lose his world title to<br>  John Cena & Triple H should lose his wwe title to Randy Orton<br>  but it will make both titles on raw i think that Cena<br>  should get drafted to smackdown|`|TOKgPsdOaa	can you honestly picture cena losing at wrestlemania? especially to edge, especially if hes already beaten HBK and HHH who are much better than edge. besides when they had theyre rivalry way back when, cena made edge look like nothing. i personally like edge and would like to see him win, especially since hes been in the business for a longtime, but idk if thatll happen. vince just likes cena with the title, that way when he goes around to all those events like gillette fusion or whatever he goes as champ|`|tPFikOY7aa	Edge will retain. Orton will take wwe championship to raw off triple h.
oqQjnpfGaa	Bottom Line: <br>  Keep Granger for now (he will be back hopefully in 2-3 weeks). <br>  <br>  Francisco Garcia is a good all-around player (at this point, he is pretty good to have since he is starting).  Just be mindful that he did started this season with some injuries that kept him away for quite a few games. <br>  <br>  Beasley should be kept because JO (Jermaine O'Neal) might eventually get injured, and Beasley will be the top benificary if that happens.  Even though Beasley is not starting he will get his minutes if he keeps up his game.  For that reason, I suggest you to not drop Beasley for Aaron or Daniels.  If you really don't like Beasley, I think it will be wise to choose Aaron for the long-run since he is the Rocket's starting PG (but he will be inconsistent since he is still learning).  Daniels will help you for the next two weeks until we hear more about Granger. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|83ebpB19aa	If you drop Beasley, get Daniels. You're team appears to be much more defensive than offensive, Aaron Brooks is incredibly fast which means he won't get that much support on fast breaks.

The ref saw me and had my coach sub me out so that i could change them or just take them off,

1yOdrYiHaa	The Undertaker vs Shawn Micheals<br>  17:00 <br>  I Don't want to see The Undertaker losing his strike it's the most important thing in his whole career , It would be sad to see taker losing at wrestlemania after 16 Win|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I would prefer to see 17:0 against Shawn Michaels just because Shawn has a name of performing in top matches at Wrestlemania and was the first man to compete in an Iron Man Match and Ladder Match.  I personally don't like the man but I have to give him his due that he is a great performer.  The only reason I want to see the streak continue is simply because I don't know how other people feel about it but wouldn't it see a bit predictable that the Undertaker would happen to lose his streak at the 25th Anniversary of Wrestlemania.  It would seem a bit too coincidental for my liking...|`|bSsBGrZVaa	HBK vs Undertaker 16-1<br>  at wrestlemania|`|sQpoIxf7aa	undertaker will go 17-0 at wrestlemania why because it's what keeps wrestlemania big and it keeps the legend of the undertaker alive and against who i would like to see him verse shawn michaels because he is my favourite wrestler and i think that if this match happened it would go down as the greatist of all time|`|AA11482019	The Undertaker is over rated.  If you take away his fancy entrance and his stupid Halloween costume, he's a mediocre wrestler at best.  The only reason he is undefeated at WrestleMania is because he's been booked to win every match.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels<br>  <br>  17:1<br>  as this match would be a draw.|`|G6eUPxQlaa	17-0 against HBK in a H*** in a Cell match. The winner faces the WWE champion at Backlash in a stipulation of their choice. HBK begins the match entering with a steel chair, immediately climbing to the top of the cell, waiting for the dead man to arrive. As the undertaker enters the arena, a cold chill goes through the air as usual. Undertaker climbs to the top, not anticipating an attack with a chair by the Heartbreak Kid. Shawn Michaels immediately busts open the Undertaker, leaving him a bloody mess on the floor. HBK goes inside the cage and steps into the ring. And just as the very first match of it's kind, Kane's pyro goes off. But instead of assaulting the Undertaker, he just joins along in the match, assisting the dead man by choke slamming, tomb stoning, and just plain old battering HBK. Then, Undertaker goes to the top. HBK follows, while leaving a trail of blood behind. Undertaker gets him in the Devil's Gate on the top of the cell, and just as it seems HBK will tap, JBL's entrance bell rings. He too climbs to the top, power bombing Undertaker through the top. He quickly leaves. Then, Undertaker, battered, bloodied, and bruised, sits straight up to the amazement of the fans. He grabs a table from underneath the ring, placing it dead center underneath an already opened cell roof panel. He lights it ablaze, quickly climbing to the top. However, his plan backfires deeply. HBK was prepared and performs Sweet Chin Music, putting the dead man through the cell, through a flaming table, and amazingly, through the ring. After a few second the lights go out, and about a minute later, there is another table, ready for Shawn, and the dead man climbs. He performs a Tombstone Piledriver on HBK through the top of the cell, the table, and pins him, but however severely fractures his knee from the devastating impact. HBK on the other hand, HBK fractures his skull, and has a severe concussion, and a night later on RAW, he is about to announce retirement, and Triple H comes out, sporting DX clothing, and asks Shawn to reform DX to take out a new conspiracy, Randy Orton and the Legacy.|`|77b5BDf3aa	Sigh.......ok everyone get it right it will be HBK Vs Undertaker and it will be 17-0 his record will get to 20-0 then he might loose but probably will retire 20-0 at WM.|`|WGhZ1QeBaa	dude wwe is all planned out...dont even tripp
9UhoUcM2aa	Heat <br>  Spurs(dirtyy)<br>  Hornets<br>  Kings|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Whomever wins is not good for the Knicks, so I do not care. I hate the Heat w/ a passion being a Knicks fan. And although, the Sixers are the only team in Knicks division not considered a rival. I still do not, like one player on that entire team and held a grudge at them, which I still have for not giving AI the means to ever win a title and then trading him in such a bad way.<br>  <br>  Spurs are going to kill them<br>  <br>  Jazz will squeeze out a win. D.Will gets the better of CP3 in 1 on 1 situations cause of his superior strength. Jazz are also better.<br>  <br>  Mavericks will kill them|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Who will care?|`|GfOR2H0kaa	76ers<br>  Spurs<br>  Jazzzzz<br>  Mavs|`|NEtVRjplaa	Heat<br>  Spurs<br>  Jazz<br>  Mavs<br>  <br>  :D|`|3zGTnghRaa	heat<br>  spurs<br>  hornets<br>  mavs|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Philly but it'll b close. Philly got a nice PG in Andre miller and they got Iggy and dalembert although heat have Dwade and daqeun cooks not bad and udonis Haslems a good and consistent rebounder. Marion and Beasley will b tough for philly considering that philly dont really hav the greatest SF's . <br>  <br>  Spurs, without doubt, Wizards are only gud wit arenas dropping thirty but besides that they got nuffin and Spurs have Timmy D who nobody can guard in the low post from the wizards. Tony parker will run all over deshawn Stevenson. Manu will be unstoppable. <br>  This is a very close one could go either way, Hornets suffering the loss of Tyson Chandler will need Chris Paul to step up. David West will also hav 2 step up. The Jazz on the other hand hav another quality PG in Deron Williams, which will b a great match up but the hornets wont hav an answer for both Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur. Jazz by about 10 or 5 points. <br>  Kings will just get plain ripped by Mavs, Dirk is playing great ball at the moment and kings wont b able to stop JTerry or Josh Howard and because of the Kings new trade their team chemistry just isn't there right now. Mavs by 15 at least.|`|zN82yuVDaa	Heat<br>  Spurs(definite)<br>  Jazz<br>  Maverics(Kings suck now that they dont have brad miller)
4b63df522adcbbe3effabc36048eabe4aa	So whats your point? The two best teams go into the finals, that's what everyone wants to see. You know why? Because throughout the season people wonder, "Who is better, Cavs or LA?" Then they get to see a 7-game showdown to see who truly is the best! The reason the NFL isn't as predictable is because they're playoff system. It consists of 1 game, anybody can take it that night, whether your the worst or the best team. The worst team can be on fire, while the best team is having an off-night. All it takes is one bad game, or one problem, or one turnover and the game can be ruined. Your out!<br>  <br>  In the NBA, you have 7 chances. No excuses. You can't say that this team was better but they had an off-night all 4 nights they loss int he best of 7. Can you? No. If someone beats you 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, that means they were better, hands-down, I don't care what the record throughout the season showed. If you can't beat the opposing team 4 of 7 then you are not better than that team. That's what makes the NBA more legit when it comes down to the champion. The one who wins, truly deserves that win. They battled through a possible 28 games to get to that trophy... int he NFL you battle through 3 games.<br>  <br>  Although, you can look at it another way. In which the NFL's system is better because it shows who the real champion is because the best won't buckle under high pressure situations, they win even in the clutch. But, I don't believe that theory... everyone has a bad game. Maybe the quarterback got was in a dispute with the head coach before the game and now his game is a little off and his minds somewhere else? Who knows...|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Thats just one season.  It doesn't happen that way all the time.  The year before the top 2 teams were Detroit and Dallas, and Dallas lost in the first round.  San Antonio, a 3 seed in the west, swept Cleveland the 2 in the East.  So yeah, it doesn't always happen that way.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Wait till the end of the season to say something like that.. You never know.|`|LCV8Aky2aa	Even though it can be a little predictable there are always underdogs and teams who are just clicking in the playoffs but I'd have to say that the top 4 teams generally always make it to the conference finals or semi conference finals|`|3zGTnghRaa	LAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!! YA digggggggggggggg!!|`|zJAVYQWiaa	I think your wrong about the lakers.<br>  Cavs :)|`|5BWHTiIiaa	NFL is the most unperdictable because the playoffs are 1 game. Anything can happen in 1 game but in a 7 game series the better team wins.
l0iCqzlQaa	still arent going anywhere if they make the playoffs|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Yeah, well you guys also lost Robinson today too. But the good thing is you guys got a pretty good SG/SF in Larry Hughes.|`|E5XFKorjaa	true.It was a great day but the buzzer just went off.so it is over!<br>  CELEBRATE!!!<br>  p.s. just got news Shaq is in phoneix,still.<br>  so enjoy the "new" New York Knicks!<br>  cant wait for King James to be Knick James!<br>  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?page=TradeTalkRoundup-090218" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story...</a><br>  look right above the Jefferson one.J.A.

Looks like the Rockets are just giving the Magic Alston for nobody.|`|4L8h8Rp9aa	The biggest move will be Rafer Alston going to Orlando. He will fill in for Jameer Nelson and probably put up solid numbers with Dwight Howard getting so much attention.<br>  <br>  The Rockets get Kyle Lowry from the Grizzlies, a decent player. He is good rebounding guard and still has some upside.<br>  <br>  Memphis gets a first round pick and can continue to build around Ovinton J'Anthony Mayo and Rudy Gay.|`|E5XFKorjaa	actually it is over.it ended at 3 et today and thats it. all trades are done for this year.<br>  sorry 2 break it to you.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	it was over 1 hour and 11 minutes ago.|`|Vep76FT9aa	maybe not well see

v5MP0KJ8aa	North Carolina is the best offensive team in the nation averaging 91.7 point per game. VMI actually averages 94.4 points per game but against weaker competition. As far as defense goes, Washington St. only allows 54.1 points per game and Illinois only 55.7 which is pretty good considering they play in major conferences. You also have to consider the style of play in those conferences, slow and methodical.|`|VHphDgrhaa	Offensive: Oklahoma Sooners<br>  Defensive: i don't know but Duke?<br>  <br>  <br>    Go Memphis Tigers!!!!|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Carolina Tarheels no doubt!<br>  <br>  <br>  Davidson is pretty good with Offensive, especially since they have Stephen Curry<br>  <br>  Clemson is pretty good with defensive<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Tarheels are the best at both!|`|eDXKsRToaa	I think Uconn is best in defence because they have the most steals in The Big East conference and that is why they are #1. I think Unc has the best offence because they have player of the year award and they win against high ranked teams and only lost twice which is why they are #2.|`|eF60R7DPaa	BOSTON COLLEGE!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  HEY UNC FANS 85-78!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2c06c70e0667ded65705faae5ad6886aaa	Then may God have mercy on us all.|`|GswnLKtQaa	maybe 60+ or 70+ games depending on the role players around them. that would be a good center-point guard combo both on offence especially on defence.|`|VHphDgrhaa	That is a lie i say they would only lose 5 games a season though.  They would be the best team mates better than chris paul was with chandler before he got traded.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	They would just need some reliable role players that can at least hit shots when open and defend and BOOM! <br>  <br>  The sky is the limit for them. <br>  <br>  They could even be better than John Stockton and Karl Malone. <br>  <br>  Chris Paul might break John Stockton's assist and steals record and Dwight Howard will be one of the best big man to ever play in the NBA.<br>  <br>  They would be a perfect fit to each other and be the best 1-2 punch in the NBA. They could also win a championship or two. Or three. <br>  <br>  I really think Chris Paul and Dwight Howard being on the same team would be scary great.|`|ff7EcBBGaa	Magic would beat the stupid Celtics and Calvs all the time.

The the question would be who would move where? If Paul comes to Orlando, he would have huge players around him and it would be crazy. Almost all the players on the Magic have good range. If Howard goes to the Hornet, I don't think he would make such a impact as Paul would be if he came to Orlando. The team would be crazy thou. CP3 and Superman, nice.|`|cf097e014c6acfacb1c669aa3ee29effaa	I think they would win a championship even without a decent supporting cast. <br>  History has shown that first-class PG and C are the common demoninators to all Championship winning teams...<br>  CELTICS (Rondo and Garnett) - Yes, Rondo was/is first-class (PLEASE look at his stat-lines throughout the Finals - particularly Game 6 where (IMO) he would have won Finals MVP had it not been for Pierce's BS theatrics with that fkin wheelchair!!! - sorry, I feel really strongly about Pierce's overestimation PLUS Rondo is a SUPERHUMAN rebounder CAREER HIGH - 15!!!!

Ez0z7Of3aa	I'm not sure if Boozer will sign with them. I think the Pistons are going to let go of Iverson and Wallace to make some Cap space. Detroit is preparing for 2010, to sign someone like LeBron or Wade or someone from their batch. I think their not going to hunt people down next year but instead continue with what they have or maybe sign some low salary guys that can contribute.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	i don't think they will make dyess as their center. most probably they will have this line up :<br>  <br>  C K.Brown (unless they sign a new center or draft 1)<br>  PF McDyess<br>  SF Prince<br>  SG Hamilton<br>  PG Stuckey<br>  <br>  but i don't think they will let go of Sheed.|`|GMc2QJTYaa	They probably won't sign boozer considering he won't be young for long and I think they are going to try to sign someone young like Chris Bosh and if possible sign D-Wade considering that they now have the most cap space out of everyone except the thunder. They probably will sign some other young players to g along with stuckey who is defintitely a futre All-Star (Doubtful) and if he makes a monsterous change next year with the loss of AI and sheed which could happen bbecause a lot of the scoring will fall on him
Nzk70xVwaa	New England EASILY. Since Brady became starter, they've only missed the playoffs ONCE in 2002. (Not including this year of course) And that's only because there was a huge 9-7 tiebreaker between them and 2 other teams in their division, plus in a wildcard spot. <br>  <br>  After that they've been extremely consistent, getting at least 10 wins and winning at least one playoff game since Brady's debut (excluding the 2002 season)<br>  <br>  Here's been their records since the first SB<br>  <br>  2001: 11-5 (Won Super Bowl)<br>  2002: 9-7 (Missed playoffs)<br>  2003: 14-2 (Won Super Bowl)<br>  2004: 14-2 (Won Super Bowl)<br>  2005: 10-6 (Lost @ Denver divisional round)<br>  2006: 12-4 (Lost @ Indianapolis AFCCG)<br>  2007: 16-0 (Lost  Super Bowl)<br>  2008: (With Cassel) 11-5 (Missed playoffs)<br>  <br>  Tell me that's not dominance. <br>  <br>  But the Steelers on the other hand, though they've had winning records haven't made as much damage in the playoffs as New England has. Plus, they've never beat New England in the playoffs (Both of those games being at Pittsburgh during the AFCCG and Brady kicking their asses)|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Bottom line is that the Steelers won the Super Bowl and New England didn't make it to the playoffs.  You can average in past victories to justify Patriot greatness if you want, but that was then and this is now my friend.|`|4XdevoVwaa	The Patriots no doubt. The have been the standard of football this decade.|`|fTGMgTdvaa	New England. Pittsburgh would likely be 0-2 in Super Bowls this decade if the games had been correctly officiated.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Are you kidding me? Patriots still are the better team this decade.|`|8QUF659maa	I will tell you who WASN'T a good team this decade.<br>  <br>  Buffalo|`|ZH6fK9Mjaa	without tom brady the pats had NO hope at the super bowl|`|JTSNljLhaa	what do you think?|`|yxaOg0QDaa	the pats were better earlier, but the dynasty has been over for quite some time<br>  <br>  I'm a die hard yankee fan, I remember trying to convince myself, some how, that we were still the team to beat..but when you haven't won a world series in 8 years, its kind of hard to explain<br>  <br>  whether or not you make the playoffs is irrelevent, its rings<br>  <br>  the pats have not won a superbowl since 04<br>  <br>  we're going into the 09/10 season, dynasty over<br>  <br>  and everyone seems so sure that the pats would've won with a healthy brady, why? they lost to the wild card giants when he was at the helm<br>  <br>  bottomline, the pats have no balance anymore and that's why its going to be harder for them to compete, they have no run, and an aging defense, they are extremely 1 dimensional, they have a phenomenal passing game and that's it, deep pass to wes welker or randy moss and there you go, once the giants took away the pass the pats were on their back like a turtle<br>  <br>  and now with brady possibly coming back, you can't expect him to be top shelf after a serious leg injury and an entire year off from playing football, he's human not bionic, and they also have a harder schedule coming this year<br>  <br>  they haven't won a championship since 04, and the steelers won 2 of the last 4 superbowls, they are the new dynasty, for now<br>  <br>  so my answer is split, pats were better before, steelers are better now, numbers don't lie|`|ptiIz2nWaa	I'll have to say New England, but when the question of cheating is in the air you have to wonder.|`|Z8j12z8Vaa	I think it's fair to say that Patriots were the team of 2000-2005 where as the Steelers have been the team of 2005 - present.|`|Ty4Hdm2Haa	New England has been to 4 super bowls and won 3.  <br>  <br>  Pittsburgh has won 2.  <br>  <br>  You have to give this decade to New England.|`|fincuc5Oaa	Pittsburgh is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HlBnuWJ1aa	well New England did cheat.. <br>  <br>  So im going with Pittsburgh|`|E59UQlQRaa	patriots all the way!!!!! the are the reason i get up every morning..lol|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Pats thus far, this isnt even close.|`|a6EndAPiaa	So far it would be the Patriots.  However, the decade is not over yet.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Well the simple response is New England's 3 championships as opposed to Pittsburgh's 2, though I will also point out the fact that the Pats have been consistent serious contenders this decade while the Steelers really haven't done much between their last title and most recent.  Not to mention, had Tom Brady not been injured this season that would have most likely been the Pats leaving Tampa Bay with the trophy considering Brady's uncanny ability to own Pittsburgh's defense on a regular basis.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Pats, 3 superbowls, 18-1 season, been to 4 superbowls, record setting season, constantly dominating the nfl this decade<br>  steelers, 2 superbowls, inconsistent, questionable calls, ben has too many picks, rely on defense  <br>  so its the pats!|`|3oUSroiZaa	New England-3 superbowl wins<br>  Pittsburgh-2 superbowl wins|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Pats are!
S7rc6mp7aa	Manu is the best, then Dirk... Manu has an all round game like you said. Also is he is pretty good defensive player too. <br>  <br>  He would be a starter in any other team, but Pop knows what he doing. Resting him for the playoffs so he could really do some damage.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I think you should put Dirk and Nash too, Dirk probably is the best because he's the leader of his team and also became an MVP. same goes with Nash.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	No. He's the "Dwyane Wade (current best international player)". Hakeem "The Dream" is the "Michael Jordan".|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Manu might be the best international player in the NBA, but I wouldn't call him the "Michael Jordan".   Jordan was head and shoulders above every other player in the league.  If Manu is the best, it's by a fairly narrow margin.  Heck, he might not even be the best international player on his own team.|`|HIfs0vgzaa	I also hate Manu but I have to agree with you. <br>  <br>  I also think Manu Ginobili is the Michael Jordan of international players. <br>  <br>  He even won lots of championships and awards in EUrope even before coming to the NBA.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	parker-gasol-manu-dirk<br>  in that order|`|Vep76FT9aa	yas?|`|jzFYMMU2aa	try tony parker then gasol.|`|AA10453526	no

uNdQ7Te4aa	I  am a proud kiwi living in Melbourne and I have been to 3 Tigers games this season. The breakers are playing well now that CJ is healthy. His presence is the key factor as the Tigers do struggle against teams that have fast aggressive point guards. The dragons have the edge over the tigers mainly due to there guards harassing there bigger slower opponents who cant keep up. The Breakers need to box out big time as the strength of the Tigers is there rebounding. Kirk Penney is probably the MVP of the NBL but CJ will be the most important player fro the breakers and Henare too. The breakers can win if they have the self belief in them, just look at the Crocs? Man they were awesome.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	all the way to the finals

Hgm9qaf9aa	For the last two years, nobody will throw his way.  They don't even challenge him.  He basically shuts down one side of the field.  I haven't seen anything like it since Deion Sanders in his prime.  So, yes, he's worth it.|`|XLXncQu9aa	In a way I think it is not such a good idea to pay a CB $45 million.  Asomugha didn't even have an interception last season even though he started 15 out of 17 games.  His production in that area was limited.  He also only has 10 interceptions in his career with the Raiders.  The only thing that impresses me about him is that he tackles so well.  He's one of the few CB's in the league that tackle and actually wrap up the offensive player.  I think he is being paid a bit much but what it represents is that the Raiders are willing to put their money into a player that can play.  He's not a bad CB but the problem is he needs to produce more than he has.  Asomugha needs to produce otherwise all of that money will go to waste.  We saw that with De'Angelo Hall.  He didn't work out with the Raiders and he turned out to be a waste of money and time.  So it would behoove the Raiders to make sure they invest wisely, and I'm not sure if they did that with this latest re-signing.|`|4kdlE54Paa	As long as he continues to play at elite form, he would be worth it for any team.  You are definitely right about his physical abilities.  He is a really intelligent football player.  He reads the QB like a computer.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|15wwA3jjaa	Yes he is worth that, the guy is the best CB in the league and deserves top dollar.  My only question is why he would waste his time signing with the Raiders for another 3 years when he could have gotten out of that dump and received top dollar from an actual contender.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	no.  He is a very good player, but he got a little press this year an all the sudden people say he is the best CB in football.  Its hilarious.  Based on what?  Like I said, he is excellent, but when 9 out of 10 say he is the best, Id like some stats|`|2CuuIT70aa	"Worth it" is a relative term, but I think that his market value will make that salary justified.<br>  <br>  He's not really Ed Reed for CBs, he's more like a bigger Champ Bailey.  Has tremendous game speed and is a big guy who plays like it; he's one of the few cornerbacks who can really maul these gigantic receivers that keep coming up across the league.  The guy held Andre Johnson in check when the two played each other; that's a heck of an accomplishment.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	yes yes and YES, the dude is a beast it just sucks he wont be in a Vikings uniform<br>  <br>  his numbers arent the greatest but that is because nobody throws to him, I think he held Fitzgerald and Steve Smith to one catch and Randy Moss to 3 and when Moss scored his tds they were thrown away from Nnamdi|`|VckdHm3Qaa	he is the best CB now<br>  in 2007 he only allowed 9 catchs and only was thrown too 29 times<br>  hes a Shutdown CB where ppl dont throw his way|`|fnPyq2iqaa	.|`|AOA8TJraaa	No he is not.|`|op4fEbEVaa	Yeah he's a great CB|`|UxX3uBp2aa	best corner of all time in my opinion through 10 weeks he was thrown at 10 times|`|BwhMgmxFaa	I'm worth that....whoss payin mee mah monayyyy|`|nfeHwlu4aa	Probably not, though he is tremendous.<br>  <br>  Teams covet "shutdown corners" but the simple truth is that they don't singlehandedly change the complexion of a defense.<br>  <br>  Champ Bailey has been a top corner for years and is very good, but Denver's defense continues to decline because of a porous D-line.  He can't afford to take chances and be that ballhawk.<br>  <br>  The Ravens secondary would be nothing without the D-line and linebacking.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, money is better spent on the D-line, and can make an average corner look better than he really is.|`|LsvklXmnaa	he had a great year last year and was the only shining light on that team.  he is worth what he got.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  if u mean he is a bigger, slower Champ Bailey, then yeah.  Asomugha runs around a 4.5, Bailey 4.25.  i would agree he is one of the most physical cbs in the league, thats what makes him worth the big bucks
zg1lIy7Oaa	Kwame Brown was drafted number 1 overall by the Washington Wizards in 2001 and was listed as ESPN’s #1 draft bust of all time. He even has a website aptly named KwameBrownSucks.com devoted to the fact that he sucks.<br>  <br>  To this point, draft night has been the highlight of Brown’s professional career. The rest is often summed up in one word: Bust.<br>  <br>  Though he’s displayed flashes of athleticism, the former No. 1 pick straight outta high school never seemed to grasp the sport, always looked lost on the court, and a frustrated fan even started a negative blog about him (though it hasn’t been updated in 18 months).<br>  <br>  To Hoopfan : You should review basketball history of Houston Rockets before calling Ralph Sampson a bust... He was the ROY before injuries began to take their toll.|`|AJEDjzC1aa	Darko, being picked ahead of Dwayne Wade, Carmelo, Chris Bosh, etc.<br>  <br>  Talking about #1 overall then Kwame Brown of course|`|aXD49Izpaa	greg oden  is shaping up to be a bust. didn't play 1st season  cause injured in practice  about to be on the dl list  again for chipped knee cap and he was supposed to be a great help to portland hahah|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	Sam Bowie was the 2nd pick not 1st.<br>  <br>  ....Geez do some reserach kid.<br>  <br>  I'm gonna go with Pf Joe Smith, he was the #1 picked player in the '95 draft .

If the Knicks could move Jeffries, it would clear another $6.8 million in the summer of 2010.<br>  <br>  The Knicks would have to give up the talented Robinson and eat Thomas’ $8.7 million salary next year … but it’s probably worth it to the Knicks. Especially now that they’ve shored up their offense with the deals for Larry Hughes and Chris Wilcox.|`|uFqkgwhQaa	Knicks rejected this offer hour ago|`|Qb5mffM9aa	No, the Knicks rejected them.

qP1MvlElaa	To be honest I don't thing you need to many any major acquisitions. The Packers were a great team last year that faced a number of heartbreaking collapses in the final 2 minutes of numerous games. You have a great young Quarterback in Rogers, a great receivers and a good enough defense. Depth on the O-Line would help but besides that I expect the Packers to be a good rival of the Vikings once again.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Get Favre back.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	get a better team|`|8Bu8pZbraa	In a serious answer to your question, our switching from the 4-3 to the 3-4 will cause some serious reassignments in the front 7. Aaron Kampmann, our best pass rusher is moving to LB, and we need a big nost tackle that can occupy multiple blockers at once. In addition, we need another big name defensive end. Julius Peppers seems intriguing, but he has been given the franchise tag so getting him will cost a LOT. Terrell Suggs from the Ravens looks like a better choice.<br>  <br>  In terms of the offense, the offense was clicking well in the beginning of the season until things went to hell. Aaron has proven himself to be better than most people thought, and he is posed to have a great year next season. <br>  <br>  All in all, I wouldn't sweat it|`|6STKRenhaa	use first round pick on bj raji. second round pick on tyvon jackson.<br>  now you have a run clogging line with these guys and cullen jenkins.<br>  move aaron kampon to outside linebacker to get a pass rush. they have a good set of linebackers now if the secondary can stay healthy this can be a top 5 defense if aaron kampon's transition is sussuful.<br>  <br>  on offense ryan grant needs to get back to his old self. i expect him to have a breakout year, the offensive line needs to get younger but they could address this next year. and basically just get the ball deep downfield to greg jennings and this team should be in good shape.|`|OGwYPp4yaa	well as a fellow packer fan:<br>  <br>  1. forget about julius peppers because he doesnt want to go to the NFC north<br>  2. draft a lineman in the first round (to replace tauscher and clifton cuz their aging) and draft Robert Ayers DE in the second round<br>  3. resign tauscher for 3-4 years<br>  4. get a FA linebacker<br>  <br>  i also agree with BK|`|ejrVotg8aa	I don't think they were as bad as their record showed. They lost the majority of their games by under 3 points and in the final minutes. They need to get their edge back. I think switching the D to a 3-4 could add the needed pass rush that was missing last season. They'll have Barnett and Jenkins back on defense, which badly missed them. They'll need to find a solid nose tackle in the draft of FA. They could use another end or two. They could shore up the O-line a bit. I think they're on the edge of a break out team. They have a lot of young talent.|`|dy1ibK1Oaa	You guys suck, go bears.|`|xfJuyHoeaa	New coach

And the next player in line gets to challenge the winner and holder of the pool table.<br>  Sign up and challenge as many times as you wish. But to be "king of the hill', you must continue to win.
XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	All about squats.|`|VHphDgrhaa	Thats ok if you can't dunk yet your young like me plus i can get close and i haven't hit my growth spurt. just tie heavy things to your legs and jump it will strengthen all your leg muscles. i am 13 years old without growths spurt  5'4 and can touch rim on a 8.5ft.|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	Ur 6'2 and cant dunk?!<br>  <br>  Ok well u need to work on ur leg muscles, like doing squats and lifting weights, stuff like that|`|KJh0CHj8aa	Hey, I'm 6' 2" and 18 years old and I can't dunk either. <br>  <br>  Just keep practicing and get your leg muscles stronger.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Squats and Situps.

5yZICXImaa	Yes this is possible and some people are smart to learn at young ages but I beleive before you will have noticably much more amazing power of your left arm. I would think that if you threw left handed everyday for about 100 throws and keep increasing and do everything left handed that it would be possilbe. Pat Venditte is an ambidextrous pitcher. Billy Wagner learned to throw with the other hand after he broke his throwing arm. So keep trying and it is possible you just have to put in the effort.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	Well you know, Billy Wagner,broke him right arm and started throwing lefty, and he ended up being able to throw 100. So it all depends on the person, it wouldn't hurt to be ambidextrous.

Im sorry, but i find this very very interesting... I shall look it up for you!<br>  <br>  Well i think that you would be able to throw, not very well or very hard but i think you would be able to throw better than you did with your right arm at the moment... Just look at that pitcher who can throw with both hands... <br>  <br>  I hope you learn dude!|`|aTIUotAtaa	its not just your arm throwing from the other side you know? you have to position your legs hips and chest. it will be a long long time to get it down correctly, and is almost guaranteed not to be as good as throwing with your arm that used to be good|`|t4ZrUvDuaa	well this is a stupid question unless you broke one arm then why would you ever want to learn how to throw with your other arm<br>  <br>  but im sure its possible|`|AA11136320	I don't know how it is for an adult but I taught myself how to throw with my left hand at like age 10.

They dress how ever they want to dress I don't think what they wear can bring any more attention then just Lebron or Wade walking into a room. Lebron never dresses like a nerd in the 1st place so idk where you got that and Wade did it like one time and he actually pulled it off.|`|HJrTuihcaa	they dress like that because they like to dress that way..why do you dress they way you dress?|`|S3E3Z7vMaa	he's black and he's a beast<br>  so he can do whatever he wants|`|kzAgfqhyaa	Cause they're so pimp.

MFI0V2GBaa	I'm 5'2 115 pounds I ride all park and I ride a 140. It is a bit big, I'd perfer to be riding a 138 but I was sick of riding youth boys boards for so many years so I wanted to get the womens rome detail.<br>  <br>  As far as brands go, I'd stay get a rome, no doubt they make the flexiest boards for the sizes, you could get a burton, or a forum in you're size but it's going to be stiff.<br>  I'd check out the Rome Label, it's a youth boys board, but I rode it last year, and loved it, it's flexy and comes in a 133 or 138 this year. <br>  I'd bet a 135 would be perfect for you, which kinda sucks because not alot of boards are in that size this year, but I'd say go for the 138, it might be a tiny bit bigger but riding too short of a board can be worse some times.<br>  <br>  If you're not into rome all that much, which I'd say would be the best for park, and for a shorter girl such as yourself, I'd check out the Capita Mini board, it's again in a either 133 or 138, it doesn't have such childish graphics as the Label, and is a little stiffer. I'd still choose the rome though.<br>  <br>  Another option would be to check out signal snowboards, the Park series 134, It'd be a decent size for you, they are awesome boards, and sick graphics, a little pricey though. And I can't say how flexy they are all too much. <br>  <br>  Over all I'd say you wouldn't be dissapointed with the rome board. Myself being a smaller sized girl, that rides all park, I've spent forever finding the perfect boards for park, and I'd say that rome does the best job with making small boards.<br>  <br>  Good luck hope this helped!|`|eUZ3nAj5aa	ha lib tech has a banana tech board<br>  it is amazing for jumps kuz u can spring real high <br>  normal boards have a peice of wood between your feet and that is what the board rocks on, its called the rocker, and that helps you spring off the ground. Lib tech made teir board so that the rocker in underneath your feet so the middle of the board has a crazy flex and that makes it super to give a little more pop on a jump, it also helps on carving, dont feel like explaining that one|`|WTw9BSOYaa	Check out the Capita Saturnia, K2 VVV Rockered, Ride Canvas or Rome Lo-Fi, Never Summer Pandora for snowboards in the 140+ Range, for smaller decks check out K2 Fling, GNU B-Real or Salomon Radiant for the 130s.<br>  Id say for your weight anything from a 138 to a 142ish would work fine for you, Id suggest the Saturnia or the VVV Rockered.<br>  If you dont mind a guys deck, there are also the Capita Stairmaster Mini decks that run from 133-138.|`|AKoitlwSaa	Hey Mayday,<br>  <br>  Good ones mentioned already.  Another good one I have heard good things about by many is the Burton GTwin.  Heard it was a good park board and good to start with.|`|WPof1jcxaa	The only good womens board i know is the K2 Va Va Voom (VVV). It would be a great park board with a good flex and pop. I have a similar thing in mens (the world wide weapon) and its great. If im correct and its like mine your suppose to size down about 5cm because the shorten the tip and tail so you will have a longer effective edge, and it will ride like i bigger board, but is easier to spin and it is real easy to press.<br>  <br>  Yeah get it with rocker, but rocker doesnt have to do with the wood in the middle or pop. It is a reverse camber, meaning the board is curved like a bannana or rocking chair. It does change the handling making it nice and it makes it have a nive flex and really easy to press.|`|qqt0GTW8aa	The K2 Va Va Voom Rocker.<br>  I love this board.<br>  I am 5'2" and 115lbs and I ride a 143.

AA11674745	Wow, that's amazing. Stories like that should be obsessed over by the news networks. And that's why I love sports. There are so many examples of class and opportunities to show it than in real life.<br>  <br>  The New York Rangers fans earned a lot of respect when they applauded Jeremy Roenick after he took a slapshot to the jaw. I mean, here are the Flyers - one of their fiercest and perhaps most hated rivals and the New Yorkers in attendance showed humanity, class and good sportsmanship as he was being led from the ice.<br>  <br>  Any time fans recognize the accomplishments of opposing players, it reminds me that after all the shenanigans we sometimes commit, underneath our team colors we are all still human.<br>  <br>  One thing I've learned about knowing people who are losing their grip on the gift of life is that their process of dealing with it teaches us to better appreciate what time we have here. And know too, that your patient is blessed to have you there to comfort him in his time of need.<br>  <br>  We are blessed to have you here among us.

The Yankees will be close but their starters need to go deep all year due to the Yanks not picking up anyone for the middle innings. C.C will probaly be a Cy Young finalist but Burnett and Hughs are a question mark if you need them both to make 25 starts or more. They already gave up the best reliever to the pen in Joba so they really don't have a solid setup guy or two to get to Rivera. The Yanks will score a TON of runs but will give up too many late in the game.|`|VeJ1niiMaa	Many of Tampa's player had a breakout season last year, my question for them is will their players be able to repeat that this year.

Some of the best quotes as well. "He hits a little roller up along first, BEHIND THE BAG! IT GETS THROUGH BUCKNER! HERE COMES KNIGHT AND THE METS WIN IT!!!!" He also covered Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, Dodger fan here, but easily #1.

It all just depends on what side of the country fans grew up on and who they listened to. Those of you on the west coast tune into a Tigers game and listen to Harwell, you'll like him. Most of you should know the voice of Callis,he is the deep voice of NFL films and the was the voice of Inside The NFL on HBO. Mel Allen was the voice of T.W.I.B before his passing.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Very high. The first time I heard Vin Scully I was kind of creped out because of the way his voice sounded and the fact that he called games by himself was also odd.

Now,   he seems to ramble at times,   often doesn't have a clue what is going on (it took him a good 4 replays to realize penny hit the ump in the face with a fastball last year),   and is one who seemingly has held on too long.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	I'm a Dodger hater, Giants lover, born in SF now living in LA - Scully is the greatest ever. After listening to him call a game, you leave a little bit classier yourself.|`|91vuNupCaa	The big 3 in my mind are Mel Allen, Vin and Harry Caray in no particular order.

Jericho then JBL then Regal the Orton is the peeking order of heels on raw right now for me and Orton's "bad@ss" thing is just proof that Attitude damaged the wrestling in the WWE beyond repair.|`|JiCfYfLraa	he is just hated by everyone and attacks everyone.<br>  <br>  randy orton is like a most wanted man and debiease and rhodes are his hitch men and they back him up.<br>  <br>  if you want to get at randy orton you have to go through cody and ted.<br>  <br>  randy orton is one of the best heels ever. he is just so hated by everyone and he doesnt give a damn.<br>  <br>  he is punting everyone including the boss,the bosses son and tried to do it to the bosses daughter. thats what makes him a great heel.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Personally, I think it's his ability to perform.  He can see it in his eyes and face so well, when he's being a "bad ***" and when he's "remorseful".|`|bRGdkOwqaa	hes just a good wrestler who has some pretty good mic skills he knows how to piss off the crowd and he is perfect for the heel character|`|IzgJpVgBaa	as much as i h8 2 say it we have clever writers imo|`|5xIroQjMaa	I honestly don't think he's that great a heel. He's one of the better ones currently, but that's not saying much considering the PG era. He's not the best (That goes, hands down, to Edge right now). Even Jericho I think is a more convincing heel. What really turns me off of Orton is the whole "the voices tell me to" line. I'm kinda done with the whole crazy wrestler shtick.<br>  <br>  edit: Well he hasn't come out and said it yet, but it seems to be what they're building up to. First there's his entrance music...and then you always see two different looks in his eyes. There's the crazy, I'm going to punt your head off look, and then his "I can't believe I just did that, I really messed up look". And he's selling the looks pretty well actually, but I'm waiting for the confession that he's crazy and hears voices that tell him what to do. It seems to be what they're building up to, and i'm just going to facepalm when they do it.

V4lAFthHaa	You really shouldn't compare college football with the NFL.  Its a totally different level.  Some #1 draft pick in the past weren't good in the NFL.<br>  <br>  I think Larry Fitzgerald will be the better long distance pass WR, while Crabtree will be a better mid-range pass WR.<br>  <br>  I think Oakland will take him.|`|rM9WzIkHaa	i dont care if hes not pro yet crabtree is the new jerry rice<br>  those only come along every 20 years<br>  <br>  i think he'll be a good pick up for washinton or oakland|`|UtwJVPn5aa	i think larrys better. my friend met him once. he got more exp. i think seattle will pick him in 2nd round|`|i0QzvbSnaa	I am a Tech fan and really like Crab, but be serious.  No way he is as good as Fitz (at least top 3 in the NFL) at this point and I doubt that he will be as good. Crab will be a quality player who can be counted on as a possession receiver who can also go deep and should go to the Rams or Browns unless trades change things.|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	Larry Fitzgerald. Crabtree has a few years until he can actually play in the NFL.<br>  <br>  As for what team he will go to, Im not sure. I guess we'll find out whenever the draft gets here|`|bOaZUcJsaa	What a ridiculous question, Fitzgerald is like the Babe Ruth to Michael Crabtree's Melky Cabrera.|`|nltFZcuGaa	Fitzy obnviously right now. i think the seahawks more than likely will if the chiefs plan on gettin a QB|`|b6Z1DEh0aa	well crabtree hasn't done anything yet and fitzgerald was on the verge of making the superbowl winning catch<br>  <br>  crabtree will probably end up having a good career but not if he goes to Seattle which is where he is supposed to go. he needs to go someplace With a good QB where he is needed|`|YL4bwPVgaa	this isnt a good question at all. crabtree hasnt proven anything except the fact that he can run circles around college level athletes. the pros are completely different, and fitzgerald is one of the best if not the best WR in the world.  Fitzgerald, no questions asked.|`|pVpQuWXzaa	Fitzgerald but you cant really tell until Crabtree verses the real Pros|`|0MJRD9sYaa	Fitzgerald is better and Crabtree will end up in Seattle.|`|RtCC98QAaa	Would be a heck of a fight, but I'd take Fitzy
SsRPJW9Zaa	you cant be half black either you are or you arent<br>  <br>  but as someone said its body type. they are more built for running (thats not a racist comment) and jumping not lifting things (neither is that)<br>  <br>  usually weight lifting is a european, american decdants of europeans thing.|`|rGGymoowaa	Maybe it has to do with the fact some of the strongest and best African American athletes are playing in the NFL. <br>  <br>   I have theory as to why Americans do so poorly in Olympic Weightlifting and I believe it has to do with the fact the strong athletic guys are linemen and LB's. Have you ever seen those guys in a combine or what they can bench press? <br>  <br>   American athletes are not as likely to go into weightlifting or strongmen as they have an opportunity to get paid playing in the NFL. While Eastern European's don't have this opportunity and above mentioned sports is their way of earning a living.|`|fzlHDkXbaa	I'm not sure, but I do know that many African Americans are good at Track/Athletics. Maybe they contrast.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Who knows|`|AC7JHO5saa	i hope you give best answer to andrewc1.. cause thats pretty damn acurate good question by the way XD....|`|b0faTDlJaa	Because they have, what like to call "show muscle", which can be best described as bigger "looking" muscles with less functional strength.|`|AVzCvK1zaa	I couldn't tell you. Maybe it's just not a popular sport for african americans. I know when it comes to poland and russia, they'll to anything they can to get out of there. It could have something to do with the cold, or with the people. Some people are naturally more stocky than others and might be able to build muscle easier. Who knows!
qY7OJ7Ttaa	dude it doesnt matter. skate to skate. im regular in skateboarding and goofy in snowboarding . go figure.  do what feels right. when i started i skated mongo. because it felt right. i didnt care what people told me. but then i learned how to skate regular. trust me its not that big of a deal.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Skate goofy since it is the most comfortable.  It doesn't matter what your friends skate.
Qn6ERwZcaa	You sound like a kid yourself--go train with the other kids, kid|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	It all depends on the style you study. I've studied Kenpo for many years, and it is street-style self defense. Though, if you ONLY study martial arts to "kick people's ***" you'll miss out on the best aspects of it.|`|REoU6f2taa	Start training in MMA, you don't even need to start taking a special class either. All you need to do is start watching UFC with some friends and practice what you see on the show. It also wouldn't hurt to start lifting weights a little after school either.|`|6vCTRkMFaa	Dont Listen to licencetoblitz If you dont nohow to do moves correctly you can Really hurt someone for life.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Start training in MMA.|`|8de1534cea12a36cb1769a869e15b47daa	run up on them and beat da shyt out of them lol datz how we do it n the woods..real talk
AA10185328	From my experience, absolutely yes!  The balance required in snowboarding is something of a cross between skateboarding and skiing.  You are getting pulled downhill like in skiing, but you are facing sideways like in skating.  Also the the twisting and leaning to control direction are very similar to skating.  There are differences that you will have to adjust to though.  First of all, you cannot turn against your front edge; well not without faceplanting anyway.  Also, a good amount of time that you are snowboarding you are actually sliding on the board bottom rather than the edge.  When you are cutting and riding on an edge, it is really similar to riding on wheels.  But, gliding on the board bottom is not something that exists normally in skating (think of it like a rail slide).  Finally, the most important is the fact that you are physically attached to the board.  There is no bailing on a trick in mid-air, you are committed.  Best of luck!|`|nCgRxGNeaa	yeah definately! I started snowboarding when i was 10 (now 14). I just started  downhill skateboarding last summer and this winter helped me a lot! I can do so much more just because of skateboarding over the summer.<br>  <br>  so yes, i think skateboarding helps a lot.|`|LdLEDGZqaa	deffinitly,it will help you with your turns and balance.also surfing will help.|`|NohyNWKuaa	No i went a few days ago and it is not the same. im ok at skatebordin if that says anything hope i helped|`|Kc8pNBGLaa	honestly no. skate boards got dem wheels, no bindings and you be ridin concrete. snowboards got bindings and its smooth sailing.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	if you have no fear then you should do fine. i am pretty good at skateboarding and longboarding, but it took me a few tries to get the hang of turning with a snowboard.  (since its a little different)    Have fun.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	Well, depends what you mean by "pick up." Like everyone, your first few runs might be a little rough, but you should be able pick it up more quickly than most do.
