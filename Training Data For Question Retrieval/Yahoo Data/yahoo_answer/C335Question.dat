Tell us about your experiences, which signs you have dated that went wrong, a disaster, and which sign you dated that you know for sure IS your true destine sign to be with? Name your sign as well...      I'll start...   I am a Scorpio, dated a Scorpio, Taurus and a Cancer.    -With Scorpio it was great since he was as passionate as I was , however we were both strong and it did not go well at all. I do not think a Scorpio with Scorpio should even try to be together, its a disaster!       -Dated the Taurus, was pretty long term, however, he is VERY selfish! So I was the  one sacrificing! Then finally got fed up and left. It was all about him, his feelings, nothing to please me or my feelings! Even thought he loved me so much that he left his ex for me! But the signs were right!       -Now am dating a Cancer and I must say, OMG :) We felt the strong connection from the first day! It was like something was pulling us together! He IS my sign to be with, we are both emotional, both water sign, both passionate, and we balance each other perfectly! He is my Crab and I love him to death! :)    As all the compatible tests say we both ARE meant to be together, the two great signs that are match made in heaven! So tell us about yours...

20090226131145AAT65SA	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Does anyone else want Nick Normon(or whatever) from American Idol to make it through the next round?	Before you tell me that I am crazy and stupid hear me out.      A lot of the contestants so far don't seem to be taking this seriously anyway, their excuses for their bad performances are "well I at least had fun on stage" which translates to "I didn't take this seriously and I chose a song that I liked instead of one that shows my talent but I screwed up and dont want to admit it".      Not to mention that on top of many people singing too low and picking the wrong songs, they are ridiculously boring. So maybe Nick should move on just to piss off the other contestants and have them step up their game. Because it may be an insult to those that really are serious, but it's also an insult to see these people screwing up their chance at stardom.      anyone agree?

I missed him so much, and haven't stopped thinking about him since August when it all went to hell....my best friend is dating his roommate, so she's there a lot, and she told me hes been asking about me a lot lately and that he felt badly about how things ended..so i called him..and he wanted to come over n talk in person...so he did and we went to down to the ocean and talked and he apologized out the *** to me, and seemed very sincere, and we wound up kissing a little bit, and he wound up sleeping over, but just cuddled with me n held my hand all night (no sex), and it was very adorable, Then this morning, I woke up sick, and he was really sweet to me about it, kissing my head and stuff n rubbing my back.... and when he left for work, he told me he'd call and see me tomorrow night...I'm happy but nervous and scared at the same time. I was just finally starting to get over him, and now all those feelings came rushing back to me.....he felt so good to be around, so comfortable...so RIGHT. and I know I shouldn't freak over the fact that he was sweet to me, but I'd give anything in this world to have what we had back....and I think, I might just get that...we'll see. he's not the normal kinda sweet talking asshole who just uses girls and blows them off, so I almost trust him but probably shouldn't...what do u think world? and a song please?

First response to correctly connect them wins 10 points!!!      Ok.......this may be hard or easy all depends. First on to post a correct answer!      Jack Nicholson and Tom Hanks...GO!
20090226132027AAw4zS7	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What do you think of my new song?	The song's called "Surrounded" and I need some constructive criticism as to the lyrics. I need to know if you like the lyrics or not. If not, please give me some suggestions.      I'm trapped inside my own dark memories.   I try to hide, but I can't get away from me.   Though I have lied to myself, I couldn't see   That my dark side created my worst enemy.      (No matter what, these memories come back again)   (All I want is to stop this from happenin')   (But no matter what I do, it starts, and then)   (The darkness overpowers me and my soul again)      The darkness surrounds me, and I can't pretend   That no one helped my, but in the end   Your help's forgotten in spite of what you've done   I've been surrounded, and I cannot run   Run, run, run.      I've tried to run from the darkness of my past.   Into the sun, but I know that it won't last.   'Cause what I've done has caught up with me so fast.   I am the one who's always been an outcast.      (No matter what, these memories come back again)   (All I want is to stop this from happenin')   (But no matter what I do, it starts, and then)   (The darkness overpowers me and my soul again)      The darkness surrounds me, and I can't pretend   That no one helped my, but in the end   Your help's forgotten in spite of what you've done   I've been surrounded, and I cannot run   Run, run, run.      No matter what I do, I cannot find the light.   And everything I try just makes me lose sight   Of everything I wanted, and I just can't realize   That everything I've done has cut me down to size.      The darkness surrounds me, and I can't pretend   That no one helped my, but in the end   Your help's forgotten in spite of what you've done   I've been surrounded, and I cannot run   Run, run, run.      That's the song. I hope you guys like it. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

A wealthy couple planned to go out for the evening, so the woman of the house gave their butler, Jeeves, the rest of the night off.      However, the wife wasn't having a good time at the party, so she came home early while her husband stayed on.      As she walked into the house, she saw Jeeves on his own in the dining room. She called for him to follow her, and led him into the master bedroom.      "Jeeves" she said, "take off my dress."      So he did.      "Jeeves" she continued, "take off my stockings."      Again, he did as he was told.      "Jeeves" she said, "remove my bra and knickers."      Once more he obeyed, as the tension reached a climax.      "Good" she said, "and if i ever catch you wearing my clothes again, you're fired!"
20090226100541AAkoOA6	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Funny joke! (Not suitable for children)?	A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years.

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:      "Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."      To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He wwas whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!"         Got any better jokes? The one that makes me laugh gets 10 point!

20090226124930AAHRMnF	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What do you guys think? (Kind of random...)?	Well, I recently saw a comment that said that people cannot listen to the Jonas Brothers and Lil Wayne together, because that is impossible. And they said if you claim that you do, you are a poser. Now, I completely disagree with that comment. I do in fact listen to Jonas Brothers and Lil Wayne. In my opinion, they are really great artists and I love listening to their songs and singing to them. Haha they are all really hot too. :] I love many other artists, such as Sum 41, Enrique Iglesias, LeAnn Rimes, T.I., Cascada, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Eminem, Simple Plan, J Holiday, 3 Days Grace, Chris Brown, and a lot more, and I consider my taste in music to be very versatile... I like a variety of music.      So, I have a couple of questions for you people...      1) Do you think people are "fake" or "posers" if they enjoy music from entirely different genres? (Why or why not...)      2) Do you guys like any of the same music I do? (What if your favorite song from the artists...)      3) If not, what type of music do you like? (Artists, genres, songs... maybe I can get hooked on the music you like too...)      (Please no talking bad about other people's music preferences. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so be positive and talk about what you like instead of dissing what other people like. Please and thank you)      :]

I've known this scorpio guy for a little over a year, we started out as acquaintances, and now we just became friends. I like hanging out with him, we have some things in common. He has a good sense of humor and says what ever is on his mind, on the other hand, he can be very self centered and b*tchy. Today, while we went out to eat, he just kept bragging on and on about how good he looks, and he just kept talking about himself. Other then that, I like being around him. Can someone give me advice please? Info? Cancer/Scorpio friendship.

After climbing to the first cloud he met a stinky, unattractive woman who said, 'Have sex with me or climb the ladder to SUCCESS.'   Jack chose to climb the ladder. At the next cloud he met a slightly better looking woman who said, 'Have sex with me or climb the ladder to SUCCESS.' Figuring it only gets better, Jack chose to climb the ladder some more. At the next cloud, he met a very attractive woman who said, 'Have sex with me or climb the ladder to SUCCESS.' Things were getting better the higher he got, so Jack chose to climb the ladder even more. At the fourth cloud, he met the most gorgeous woman to ever grace the Universe. She looked at him seductively and begged, 'Have sex with me or climb the ladder to SUCCESS.' Jack was extremely tempted to satisfy his urges but still, he climbed that ladder to SUCCESS. At the fifth cloud, Jack was startled when a greasy fat naked man with a pimply penis grabbed him. Jack asked, 'Who are you?' To which he replied, 'I'm CESS'

20090226135757AABgZUx	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	What do you think about the show "Lost"?	Last September, I watched an episode of Lost and was a little interested. But, a friend had all the first 3 seasons on DVD. So, I watched them from episode 1-the end of season 3. Of course Season 4 didn't come out on DVD until December. So, I had to wait to see that. But I was honestly traumatized. I "Needed" to see the next season. And then I found the season on the Website. So, I was caught up. Then this season started. And I am traumatized again. See, I was always able to watch them with no worries of waiting a week. LOL This is even silly to write out. But I am completely addicted to this show. After watching last night's episode, I am honestly upset that I have to wait a week for the next episode. LOL       SO, now you know what I think about the show. What do you think? And better yet, Who on the show (past and present) do you think you relate to the most? ME? I relate to John Locke the most. Can't wait to hear your answers..

Here goes…      For school, I'm doing research on the genre of manga. The point of my project is to research the opinion of the general public on manga: whether they like or dislike it, and whether they think it is good literature for young people and adults to read, etc. My group and I surveyed people at my school and found many that don't know what manga is, and many that like it, but few who are knowledgable about it and DON'T like it. For the sake of presenting a fair and accurate report on manga, I want to show both sides of the argument, as I know there are people out there who disapprove of manga. We've had trouble finding criticism of manga on the internet so far.   So this is calling all people who do NOT like manga! (manga as a type of literature and comic in general, not particular manga books or genres)   Please help us out by giving us your opinion in detail, telling us why you dislike manga.  Or also, where we can go for more manga criticism.  Thank you a million times!

I can't remember any names only how it ended and some descriptions about the story line.   The main character was thin wore a suit coat i think it was gray and tattered and he wore glasses, he carried a guitar around and i think it was his weapon or had his weapon in it. The guys he was fighting wore snake skin boots i don't think you ever see his face in the movie. This all takes place in a desert of some kind and finally at the end of the movie a little kid puts on the main characters coat glasses and picks up the guitar and walks away. I don't think the little kid ever said anything the whole movie.   I should have wrote this from the begging but it's a white guy and it does not have antonio banderas in it. Also i don't think it took place in mexico. Another detail in the movie they always made a big deal about the size of his guitar. Please read what i wrote first, it was not the mariachi or the mexico trilogy

20090226142004AAkTNNq	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Cane Ashby... on the Y&R?	Cane Ashby came into GC and was deceived by Amber Moore who faked that they were married because she was seeing $$$ signs!   Cane Ashby was deceived again by Chloe Mitchell who set him up to believe he had sex and was having a kid with her!   Cane Ashby was being deceived by his "brother" Billy Abbott because Billy was too selfish and immature to take responsibility for his child with Cane's wife Chloe!   Billy Abbott came into town with a chip on his shoulder and treated Cane like sh!t from day one. Cane was eventually shoved out of a job that he was new to but handled very well.   At the end of the day how should Cane Ashby react to this devastating news about Chloe/Billy and the fact that the baby is not his?! Just hang his head and walk away and let people continue playing him for a fool..OR...fight fire with fire and let all of them know he ain't no fool and he's tired of people playing the @ss with his life?!! If it were YOU would you just walk away??

I have never fancied a celebrity more! He's just soooo cute! I like (in Doctor Who) when he gets all excited and talks fast. And when he's serious too And he's just so cute in his glasses, my heart just melts when he puts them on! And he looks so cute in his suits he wears. And omg is hair. His smile- his amazing that actually verges on painful watching him! Okay, i should stop going on about him now. But he's just so cute.....      But, to be fair, john barrowman is VERY hot too. Haha, who cares he's married and is gay. In torchwood he isn't! I'm in love with captain jack! I hated him at first, but i guess you were supposed to. but then you really feel for him when you learn more about him. And sometimes i shout things at the tv ( like in the 2nd series, when he wouldn't let gwen research the people going through the rift), but then you realise he;'s doing it for a good reason and never set out to harm anyone. when he flirts with anyone i get so jealous! i can never decide whether he's better angry, upset or happy! I think him and the real jack harkness made a good couple, and so do him and gwen. and you could sense some real passion between him and ianto.... *crys*      so yeah, my vote is for the doctor, but, i agree, they are both mega-hot

For 2 days straight, I have been trying to find chapters 63 and 64 of Gakuen Alice.  It is becoming very frustrating and exhausting. I usually read that series on onemanga.com, but this time the chapters have skipped from 62 to 70!  Luckily, I was able to find most of them on mangafox.com.  All EXCEPT 63 and 64.       I have searched a lot of sites but for whatever reason, those two chapters seem to be missing.  I noticed that a lot of people have been asking about chapters as far as 108.  What about the chapters that are missing?!  I don't want to skip them or anything because they are 2 very important chapters to the whole story!  (Plus, the actual volume that contains the chapters will not be released any time soon!)      Please, if any of you guys know where I could read them, tell me.  It would be such a big help.

20090226142510AAczkNp	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	12 yo cousin is fighting to be a comic artist?!?	My cousin is 12, and as I see, she's very, very talented for a kid. She can beat some adult with her drawings, which are exclusively animals/human in manga-ish style. Her anatomy skills are superb, she know perfectly how to do prospective and movements. She got online drawing lessons from when she were 8.   She drawn a comic, and she got to a publisher, but it didn't accepted her request for young age and theme not relative to the artist's age (the theme is rather mature, with gore, violence, cussing and religious themes), even if the style amazed the editor.   She tried again, like, 8 times, but same.   So she started to fight for it, cussing to the laws of Italy (she lives in Italy) about younger working. Even police isn't able to stop her.   Now she is going to take her parents in trouble if she doesn't get what she deserve (her comic published). Also she suffer from Major depression, and that takes another risk on her if the publisher doesn't publish it. (the comic show all the feelings of the little girl) And she is at risk of suicide.      So, what do you think about it? I'm with her, but only because she's talented and seriously depressed (she says her life sucks at all, and have social disorders such as paranoia and is schizoid). Should she be a comic artist at this age?

They don't understand that the point of assigned question/problem is to improve their own problem-solving skills - for their own benefit - so that they can apply them in real-world situations. People have got it all wrong: they think its for their teacher/grader's sake that they have to do this! What are your thoughts/similar experiences on the subject?

He found out his (Aries) ex girlfriend had been cheating on him with 5 different guys the entire time of their relationship. Now he's sad and claims it's the thought that she never even cared, that kills him.       Because all of his other friends started to preach to him about religion, he actually defriended them. Now he's chosen me to rant to, and I'm being awfully careful with my selection of words.

20090226150518AAozRsd	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Yo - Does anyone know what I should add to this?	I'm doing this project on Carnaval (an anual celebration that takes place in Brazil) for my social studies class. I'm really lazy and my social studies grades suck right now. I just failed a SS test so I need some ideas on what I should add to this writing that I'm going to print out and paste on a poster with photos:        "“Carnaval” is a remarkable annual celebration in Brazil. It lasts for four days and four nights. It includes lavish and unusual parades and spectacles. It takes place in Rio de Janeiro every year, four days before Ash Wednesday. There are always scantily dressed dancers, continuous celebrating, and striking samba beats. The word “carnival” came from the word carne vale, which means ‘farewell to meat’ in Italian. During lent, meat was not eaten when Carnaval came to South America.         During the four days and nights of Carnaval, there are tons of parades through the streets. In the 1930’s, samba schools began to compete with each other. These samba schools are also known as escolas de samba."         I don't know what else to put. Does anyone know anything interesting about Brazil's Carnaval?

20090225112412AA4JZgR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Have you done cocaine?	What do you feel like when you are on cocaine? If you have had any hallucantions, what were they like, and please include as much detail as possible. What are all the possible ways to use cocaine, and which way do you think is the most safe?      I need answers to these questions from (hopefully) someone who has done it before. I'm writing a book about a teenager who becomes addicted to cocaine, so it would be nice to get some input from past/present cocaine addicts. Thank you,   Rainbow-RoXas      PS   Actually, I suppose the title is somewhat a turn off... I just wanted people who have previously done it to view my question and answer it. I've already gotten a whole bunch of input from doctors and such, but I want to hear from a first time experiance. I want to know how it feels internally, not how a person looks on the outside while doing it.   Also, I know I've asked the exact same thing in the health section, but I don't actually think cocaine addicts would look at that section ><   And another question if you are not on it anymore:      How did it feel when you quit? Did you experiance shakes, denial, depression, or anything like that? Did you have cravings, etc?

All of a sudden, the Game Warden jumped out of the bushes.      Immediately, one of the boys threw his rod down and started running through the woods like a bat out of hell. The Game Warden was hot on his heels.      After about a half mile, the young man stopped and stooped over with his hands on his thighs to catch his breath, so the Game Warden finally caught up to him.      "Let's see yer fishin' license, Boy!" the Warden gasped.      With that, the boy pulled out his wallet and gave the Game Warden a valid fishing license.      "Well, son," said the Game Warden. "You must be about as dumb as a box of rocks! You don't have to run from me if you have a valid license!"      "Yes, sir," replied the young guy.

He went up to the car and asked the driver to roll down her window. The first thing he noticed, besides the nice red sports car, was how hot the driver was! Blue eyes, blonde, the works.       "I've pulled you over for speeding, Ma'am. Could I see your drivers license?"       "What's a license???" replied the blonde, instantly giving away the fact that she was as dumb as a stump.       "It's usually in your wallet," replied the officer. After fumbling for a few minutes, the driver managed to find it. "Now may I see your registration?" asked the cop.       "Registration..... what's that....?" asked the blonde.       "It's usually in your glove compartment." said the cop impatiently. After some more fumbling, she found the registration.       "I'll be back in a minute." said the cop and walked back to his car. The officer phoned into the dispatch to run a check on the woman's license and registration. After a few moments, the dispatcher came back, "Ummm... is this woman driving a red sports car?"       "Yes." replied the officer       "Is she a drop dead gorgeous blonde?" asked the dispatcher       "Uh... yes." replied the cop.       "Here's what you do." said the dispatcher. "Give her the stuff back, and drop your pants."       "What!!? I can't do that. Its... inappropriate." exclaimed the cop.       "Trust me. Just do it." said the dispatcher.       So the cop goes back to the car, gives back the license and registration and drops his pants, just as the dispatcher said.       The blonde looks down and sighs..... "Ohh no... not another breathalyzer......"      "STAR IF YOU LIKED"
20090226152317AAr0Su5	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Getting Out of A Ticket?	A man in his 40's bought a new BMW and was out on the interstate for a nice evening drive. The top was down, the breeze was blowing through what was left of his hair and he decided to open her up.      As the needle jumped up to 80 mph, he suddenly saw flashing red and blue lights behind him.      "There's no way they can catch a BMW," he thought to himself and opened her up further. The needle hit 90, 100.... Then the reality of the situation hit him. "What the hell am I doing?" he thought and pulled over.      The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and examined it and the car.       "It's been a long day, this is the end of my shift and it's Friday the 13th. I don't feel like more paperwork, so if you can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard before, you can go."      The guy thinks for a second and says, "Last week my wife ran off with a cop. I was afraid you were trying to give her back."      "Have a nice weekend," said the officer.      "STAR IF YOU LIKED"

20090226150658AAuc0kB	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I got your mama!! (i thought it was funny ^^)?	'I GOT YOUR MAMA'               Little Carol came into the kitchen where her mother was making         dinner.          Her birthday was coming up and she thought this was a good time to         tell her mother what she wanted. 'Mom, I want a bike for my         birthday.'         Now, Little Carol was a bit of a troublemaker. She had gotten into         trouble at school and at home.. Carol's mother asked her if she         thought she deserved to get a bike for her birthday. Little Carol,         of course, thought she did.         Carol's mother, being a Christian woman, wanted her to reflect on         her behavior over the last year, and write a letter to God and tell         him why she deserved a bike for her birthday. Little Carol stomped         up the steps to her room and sat down to write God a letter.              LETTER 1:         Dear God:        I have been a very good girl this year and I would like a bike for        my birthday. I want a red one.           Your friend, Carol            Carol knew this wasn't true.  She had not been a very good girl        this year, so she tore up the letter an d started over.                    LETTER 2:               Dear God:                 This is your friend Carol. I have been a pretty good girl this              year, and I would like a red bike for my birthday.                 Thank you, Carol                 Carol knew this wasn't true either. She tore up the letter and              started again.                          LETTER 3:                    Dear God:                      I know I haven't been a good girl this year. I am very                    sorry. I will be a good girl if you just send me a red                    bike for m y birthday.                       Thank you, Carol                       Carol knew, even if it was true, this letter was not                    going to get her a bike. By now, she was very upset.                    She went downstairs and told her mother she wanted to go                    to church. Carol's mother thought her plan had worked                    because Carol looked very sad.                       'Just be home in time for dinner,' her mother said.                    Carol walked down the street to the church and up to the                    altar. She looked around to see if anyone was there. She                    picked up a statue of the Virgin Mary , slipped it under                    her jacket and ran out of the church, down the street,                    into her house, and up to her room. She shut the door                    and sat down and wrote her letter to God.                                LETTER 4:                             I GOT YOUR MAMA.                                IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE.                                Signed, YOU KNOW WHO

20090226151305AA2yuM5	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would you like a glass of water or Coke?	WATER   1. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated.   2. In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.   3. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%.   4. One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a University of Washington study.   5. Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.   6. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.   7. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page.   8. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer.   9. By the year 2015, drinking water will be gone since the population increases. The more people, the more resources.      COKE   1. In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.   2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of Coke and it will be gone in two days.   3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous China.   4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a rumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.   5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.   6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.   7. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a sumptuous brown gravy.   8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains.   9. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.      For Your Info:   1. The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis.   2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly corrosive materials.   3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years!       Now the question is, would you like a glass of water or Coke?

I am a fan of psychological horror mostly, so maybe it's just my personal preference. But I didn't see anything that genius or spectacular in it, like a lot of people say? Definitely the most horrific violence and gore. Maybe it's so legendary because it was the first film to show that, but I don't know. I don't see what all the fuss is about. How about you?   :]

20090226152403AA0zSnI	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Help! What movie is this from back in the day!!??!!?	I have very vague details on this one, so bear with me. I want to say it was maybe in the 90's. But that is a guess cause it is an older movie that I watched as a kid and now I am 22 years old. All the details I can think of is there was  a boy who drew a cartoon boy, and the cartoon boy came to life. If I am remembering right, the cartoon boy he drew wore a baseball cap. I don't know if it was a movie, or a tv show. I think it was a movie. And it is bothering me so much that I can't think of it. Hopefully someone else knows. Help!! Lol.

20090226154546AAiuanR	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Good action anime with an amazing plot?	I really need a new action anime to watch while i wait for new episodes of Naruto, Bleach, and Hitman Reborn. It also needs a good plot because to me an anime without a good plot is really an anime that's not worth watching. I want something that has characters I'll remember, and a plot unforgettable. No guns if possible male main character. Preferably something that's story is in the present, but it's all right if it's not. I don't want some huge list of anime either just a few of the best action anime you've seen. Something where the main character is either weak, or doesn't know about his power in the beginning of the anime. Having it be ongoing would be nice. Please if  possible write a short summery of the plot and what you like most about it. Preferably something that will keep me occupied for a while hopefully over 30 episodes. A little comedy/drama would also be nice. Something fantasy/supernatural like bleach or naruto. I know this seems like the most picky question ever but honestly the only things i ask for sure are action anime with good plot with male main character.      Some of the many anime I've seen are:   Bleach(Amazing)   Naruto(All right)   Hunter X Hunter(Possibly my favorite anime ever)   Yu Yu Hakusho(Amazing)   One Piece(Got up to episode one hundred something but had to stop for a while and never got back into it. Thinking i might start that again.)    Dragon Ball(All right)   Dragon Ball Z(OK i guess)   Fate Stay Night   Flame of Recca   Full Metal Alchemist(Can't decide between this and Hunter X Hunter)   Kaze No Stigma   Kekkaishi   Law of Ueki   Death Note   Cowboy Bebob   Ramna 1/2   Samurai Champloo   Trigun   Grave of the Fireflies(Super sad movie, but still incredible)   Hellsing (Part of it)   Tokyo Underground   Kenichi   and a bunch of others that I can't remember the names of right now.   Thank you.

I had to do this Frequncy Chart for Math today and our teacher told us we needed to find a question and ask it. I asked her if, "What is Your Favorite Twilight Charater?" was okay, and she said sure, but no Edward or Bella! I was okay with that. Here were the results: Jasper - 16 votes. ALice - 21 votes, but I had to remove 4 because I had to have exactly 50 votes, no more no less. So she has 17. Emmett - 7, Carlisle - 2, Seth - 1, Laurent - 1, Rosalie - 6.   Now, why don't YOU vote? Here are your choices:   Jasper (MY favorite)   Alice   Emmett   Carlisle   Seth   Laurent   Rosalie
