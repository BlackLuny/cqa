Saya dan dia sudah jadi teman dan kita sering ngobrol2 singkat,, tapi diantara kita berdua g ada yang inisiatif nanya nomor telepon.       Akhirnya, saya yang minta duluan,, saya udah g peduli lagi karena sebentar lagi mungkin kita g akan ketemu, saya langsung aja nanya dengan santai, 'minta nomor kamu dong..' dan dia langsung kasih tanpa nanya alasan. Anehnya, dia terlihat agak bingung dan nanya dengan terbata, 'kamu pakai apa sih?' dan saya jawab,'pakai (salah satu operator cdma)'. Dia terlihat seperti mau pergi atau tidak tapi akhirnya dia pergi aja tuh !!!      G jelas banget kan ? Kenapa ya dia g nanya nomor telepon saya ?

20090225081051AAJP6oS	Family & Relationships;Family	What to do when an adult son does not respect his mother?	I have friend who has a 30 year old son. He is horribly disrespectful to her. When they disagree, he curses and calls her every name in the book... it's so sad because she is a great mom who loves her son.  He has anger issues and drinks a lot, so I'm sure that plays a big part, but he only speaks that way to his MOM and to his wife, not to his dad, his brother, or any other family members.  I've tired to console her, but since I don't have kids, I can't speak from experience and I think experience is what's needed here.       So what can she do to fix this? She's tried everything, as has her husband, who loves and supports her. I would love to be able to send her some constructive ideas on how she can handle this and what, if anything, she can do to remedy it.  Your advice would be greatly appreciated.        Please note I am asking "what to do", not "how did he get this way".  I'm not looking to place blame, just help her family move forward.  I love her very much and it hurts me when she's sad.  :-(
20090225081234AAVhpWx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He secretly asked his buddies to give me a hard time?	I know he was just kidding, but he texted both his buddies to "bust my balls" when we were at a hockey game last night. (I happened to glance over his shoulder when he was texting). He then got up to use the restroom, both guys received the message on their phones, and they were giving me a hard time (for liking the other team).       He LOVES teasing me about my choice in who I root for, sports-wise. Is this a normal thing to do? Do you think that means he is starting to really like me? We have been dating for 6 weeks and are in our mid-20s.

20090225081140AAd8kRA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me Im a prisoner in my own house Help me this is serious???????????????????????…	My sister & her husband had a party, at there house, my brother -in -law had his “cousin over. He was checking me out the whole night, & he kept on looking at me. Later on in the night, he came up to me & we started to chat. He said that he knew me from before and he remembers me from when I was at my sisters wedding. So we both started to talk He was asking me all these questions. He was smiling a lot, & we where getting along really well. We even added each other to face book. However, my older sister told me to stay away from him because she did not like him and my brother in law does not like him either. So I had to delete him off my face book. (Im 21 & His 27, he is a very successful man he has his own business and he is a sweet guy. and I couldn’t understand why I had to stay away. he said that he would see me again because this week we have another wedding party. so when I saw him again he was following me around and He was very upset and he came up to me and asked me why I deleted him off my face book. I told him that I was just sick of face book and I told him that my sister was not happy about us talking to each other. He said that he was very interested in me & he asked for my number and he asked me out on a date. However, I said that I could not go out with him because I was nervous about what my sister would think and I was worried about what my brother in law would think if they found out. He said that he would talk with them and he said that no one had to know so we stared to talk on the phone and I being to like          Him and I even meet up with him and we had a date together. he told me that he was a bad person because he had a bad past but he said that he wanted a 2nd chance and he said that he has changed a lot because he is getting help and he is more mature now. He is on depression pills but he said that he is a lot better now. He said that he wanted to be with me and he said that he wanted to meet my mom and dad and take this relationship further. so I told my bother in law that I wanted to date him. he was very understanding but he said that if I marry him that I would never be able to talk with him or my older sister again. I was so upset, my older sister found out, and she was so angry so the whole family knows that Im talking with him now and she said that he rapped a woman when he was younger. But that’s just a rumour, we don’t know for sure what happened…She told me to stay away from him and she is always calling me bad names and she called me a whore. And now my mom has locked me up in my room and they took away my phone and my face book account is deleted and I can’t email anyone and to top all that off… I had to call him up in front of my whole family and tell him that I couldn’t see him again and he is very sad and everyone is fighting and a lot of rumours have been said about him and me and I don’t know what to do because I still like him and I think that no one has a right to judge him. What do I do and I dont know how he feels anymore Im so sad?

20090225081103AATfnZg	Family & Relationships;Family	Abusive wife and mother  What should I do?	My wife is verbally and physically abusive to my children and myself.      I dont want to exagerate the situation.  She is about as verbally abusive as one could be.  She is rarely physical. However she does get there from time to time.      She has been to jail for punching me.  I have saw her hit the girls with an open hand in the face. She has been a little rough with my son. I think she knows what I might do if she hurt my boy.      My kids hate her. Ages 18, 13, 6.   (6 year old is biologicaly mine)   My kids want me to divorce her and live with me.  I would of left a long time ago if I thought I could get the kids.  I am a barrier between them and Mom.      I get them up, cook thier brekfast and take to school.  I work alot of hours ( I would change jobs to have custody) and I take care of them after I get home.        My wife does alot of stuff around the house too. More than I do.      Is it possible to contact child services and turn her in?  Is it possible to get the kids to stay with me and have her leave. If so ,  how do I do it.      If I mention Divorce, She will throw my stuff out, and I cant see the kids. I dont know what would happen to them. She might be real nice to them and she might not be good to them at all.      I dont want child services taking my 13 and 6 year old from the house.      I want my wife gone from the house.  I told my 13 year old to call 911 if she touches her again.  I do plan on leaving her, but I want to have a plan to take the kids.      My step daughter (13) might not be able to live with me. Her dad is active in her life. She said she would rather live with me, but I told her I cannot control that.      I definatly want my son to live with me. I dont think she would ever allow that. She is mean and vengful. I could make of list of what she does or says, but trust me she is verbally abusive daily.      BI-Polor... I asked her as nice as I could if she wanted to go to a counsler AGAIN. or a Doctor.  It just made her mad.      It is a terrible enviorment for my kids and myself. I know Divorce is bad, but I have no option. I just need advice on what steps should I take to have the kids with me.      I would move out and take them. I'd rather stay in the house Im at and force her to leave.        I will advise an attourny today.  I am very scared for me and my children at this time.  If you have any help for me please respond.      Please dont just say LEAVE.  It isnt that simple.      I feel like im in a cage with a lion and my kids are with me. I wouldnt leave them there. I will stay and protect them.       Sadly the law wont let me take the kids and leave. She has parent rights too.

For the first date, I asked her out and we made tentative plans for Saturday. I told her I would call her Friday to make definite plans. Which was fine I thought. This time I called her Monday and did the same thing. Asked her if she would like to go bowling (she mentioned on the first date how she use to bowl). She said yes, so I told her im not too familiar with a place to bowl up where she lives. So she told me of a place. I told her that I would call that place to see when they have open bowling to see when we could go on Friday. She said ok. I told her I would call her in a couple of days to make definite plans for Friday. Should I have just made concrete plans then? Is it too much calling in between Monday and asking her out and Friday when we will hang out?

20090225081443AAbzAcW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Depressed in Marriage?	I have been married for 3 years, i got married when i was 18 years old.  And after a couple of months being married I would go into a depression mode. it usually lasts a week or so but this time it just keeps going on. It happens every couple of months, when ever certin things come up, or i read something, or see something and i just try and picture my life if i choose not to get married. Still having my friends. My best friend and i planned a road trip to Califorina ever since grade 8 and i got married so we never went. I want to go out friday nights, where as my husband plays games on the computer all weekend. I want to travel go see places (i am dreaming of going to Ireland and England for a vacation) but husband says now hes not the traveling type, and says I cant go on my own.(and no i didnt know he would change his mind about his willingness to travel before we got married) If i do go out (with my sis in law and her friends) I have to come back home (so no drinking for me) I have no friends now, i lost them after i got married. No one to talk to other then my husband. Me and my sister are close but i dont feel like i can talk to family because i dont want to be looked down on.  I know what I would do, I would leave. Tell him i couldnt do this anymore and its over. But i cant. We have a 2yr old and a 6month old.  If i was a selfish person I would just leave, its not the life I want. But I cant do that to my kids, I love them too much for that. So now I have to live with the feeling of being trapped, depressed, and hurt when my husband says i love you and i cant even look into his eyes and say it back. I dont know what to do. Am i ever going to get over this? Or and I going be sad the rest of my life.

20090225081609AAjAbID	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do about my bitchy work colleagues?	I've just started a new job and the others in my office won't talk to me - are quite rude, in fact.  i was a little puzzled as I have never met any of them before, so I approached the one who seemed to be 'the mouth' of the group and asked what was going on.  She just said 'we don't like you, get over it'.  I have since found out that the job I have once belonged to someone who they all liked but was fired for a reason I can't find out.  They are apparently taking their anger about this out on me.  I don't want to approach management about it unless I absolutley have to.  Any suggestions would be very helpful. Thanx.

20090225081923AAnH5oR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think I am overreacting?	My husband is in Iraq. He has been there since Dec 08.    I haven't heard from him in about 3 or 4 days.    He has a cell phone, they have internet, and they can send mail for free...   My home phone is shut off and I cant call my husband on my cell phone because its 3.00 a min to talk to him. I leave him emails everyday and i write him a letter everyday and send it. When I do talk to him on the phone he says he cant talk and he will call back but doesn't. He never replies to my emails and he doesn't write letters. We both promised that we would write a letter everyday but I have been the only one who kept that promise. I understand he gets busy and i don't hold the letter thing against him but don't tell me he doesn't have 5 min to call his wife. I feel like I am the only one trying. I cant sleep at night because I have horrible dreams. I feel like I'm being ignored. I send him a care package every month and I send things that he asks for that I wouldn't do for anyone else. He is afraid I'm gonna cheat on him and he is afraid of losing me so I don't even leave the house. I work at night and I work alone so I don't come in contact with many people. So my question is do you think I'm overreacting?   and getting upset for nothing?
20090225083207AAe3Ee7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me Im a prisoner in my own house Help me this is serious???????????????????????…	My sister & her husband had a party, at there house, my brother -in -law had his “cousin over. He was checking me out the whole night, & he kept on looking at me. Later on in the night, he came up to me & we started to chat. He said that he knew me from before and he remembers me from when I was at my sisters wedding. So we both started to talk He was asking me all these questions. He was smiling a lot, & we where getting along really well. We even added each other to face book. However, my older sister told me to stay away from him because she did not like him and my brother in law does not like him either. So I had to delete him off my face book. (Im 21 & His 27, he is a very successful man he has his own business and he is a sweet guy. and I couldn’t understand why I had to stay away. he said that he would see me again because this week we have another wedding party. so when I saw him again he was following me around and He was very upset and he came up to me and asked me why I deleted him off my face book. I told him that I was just sick of face book and I told him that my sister was not happy about us talking to each other. He said that he was very interested in me & he asked for my number and he asked me out on a date. However, I said that I could not go out with him because I was nervous about what my sister would think and I was worried about what my brother in law would think if they found out. He said that he would talk with them and he said that no one had to know so we stared to talk on the phone and I being to like          Him and I even meet up with him and we had a date together. he told me that he was a bad person because he had a bad past but he said that he wanted a 2nd chance and he said that he has changed a lot because he is getting help and he is more mature now. He is on depression pills but he said that he is a lot better now. He said that he wanted to be with me and he said that he wanted to meet my mom and dad and take this relationship further. so I told my bother in law that I wanted to date him. he was very understanding but he said that if I marry him that I would never be able to talk with him or my older sister again. I was so upset, my older sister found out, and she was so angry so the whole family knows that Im talking with him now and she said that he rapped a woman when he was younger. But that’s just a rumour, we don’t know for sure what happened…She told me to stay away from him and she is always calling me bad names and she called me a whore. And now my mom has locked me up in my room and they took away my phone and my face book account is deleted and I can’t email anyone and to top all that off… I had to call him up in front of my whole family and tell him that I couldn’t see him again and he is very sad and everyone is fighting and a lot of rumours have been said about him and me and I don’t know what to do because I still like him and I think that no one has a right to judge him. What do I do and I dont know how he feels anymore Im so sad?
20090225081942AAsYEwp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does my Ex think of me...Can a GUY tell me? Put yourself in his shoes...?	I just want to know if he looks back and smiles or if he regrets ever knowing me...      Basically at first he wouldn't leave me alone until I agreed to go out with him...The first few weeks were great. We met each others parents and we went out places together. But during the following few weeks he saw me less and less!      I'd say in American terms we got to Third Base.       The days we were together things were fun and friendly, but when were apart he stopped texting me and prefered to speak to different people online.      Eventually, I became upset by his busyness and I suppose I started to become a bit of a nag, but only because he was seeing me once a week at the most, and only because I arranged it.      He broke up with me by text (heartbreaking I know) but said he didn't want to lose me as a friend. Only a few days later I saw that he had gotten back with his other ex so I deleted him from Facebook and we haven't spoken since.      Well, he and his ex lasted about a month. Now it's another 5 weeks later and I finally wished him a happy birthday on MSN. He said "cheers" and that was that.      But I'm very upset right now because I feel like I meant nothing to him! He's leaving the country in a few days and hasn't even told me or invited me to his leaving party (yet he's invited others he hardly knows)!!!      I want to re-add him on Facebook and sent him a little goodbye message but I'm scared he'll reject me.      Guys, can you relate to him and if so what would you think of me?

Its mainly because of this girl, lets name her Leah. Last year she:   -- Pushed me into a road  ( i told my mum and mum spoke to her mum which made it worse and Leah told everyone about it and i lyed to get into trouble when i didnt)   --Hit me   --***** about me      etc but that was last year and it kinda got sorted.      This year its basically like history repeating itself :(      She hasnt hit or pushed me yet but she bltches about me behind my back and its making me lose self-confidence. Im normally a really confident person and i can stand up for myself against people just not Leah and her friends.      The other day she and a friend (also meant to be my friend) told me i smelt and named lots of horrible smelly things that i smelt like ( i didnt even smell)      Last year on the way home theres a place Leah and friends would hang round and ***** about me and give me evils when I walked past and now this year im scared to walk past incase they're there. Today no one was there but in the house near it (where another of Leahs friend house is) leahs friend just stared at me.      its making me cry and feel sad and i dont want to go to school and I hate walking home on my own.       I have lots of friends but if i told any of them they wouldnt believe me about it and say leahs really nice.      :'( Please help me! I dont no what to do!!!

20090225081801AAfPpHE	Family & Relationships;Family	How do l get my dad to let me go on a cruise for my 16th??? 10 points!!?	so, heres the deal:    i want to go on a cruise to the carribean or something.   my dads making an issue about me being frivoulous, (sp?) and not spending my money wisely. i calculated it, and the total cost would be about a quarter of my money now, which i have saved for a long time for something like that. he wants me to be more 'practical', but life's too short to be practical for everything.. right?   i have presented these arguments:      -im paying for it   - im tired of being the 'practical' girl... i want to do at least ONE thing wild! =)   - life's too short   - its only a quarter of my money... he told me this is a good guideline for spending money   - my moms going with me, and i will have plenty of chaperones   - good memories   - you only turn 16 once.. this will probably be the last bday party they will have to worry about.            oh, and he keeps replying...    "its over the top for someone my age... i can do it when im 18 or when i realize where money can be better placed'         but i want to use this time when i have it!! i have this hard earned money, and i want to feel free to spend it when i dont have a house and mortgage and car to worry about!!

20090225082308AAxOpHY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This is a tough one to explain?	First off, thank you to everyone who is going to answer, but please don't throw out negativity left and right.  What my husband and I have is worth being salvaged.        Last year my husband had an emotional affair with a co-worker.  After finding out about the phone conversations and text messages online, I confronted him about who he was talking to. He claimed they were just friends and that since he knew it hurt me he wouldn't talk to her anymore. Long story short, a bunch of crap happened and about a month and a half later I found e-mails that indicated that he visited her at her other job once, and the e-mails were about pretty deep and romantic stuff.  The e-mails indicated that there was no sex involved and there seemed to be a lot of advice from "her" about talking to me about our problems and other things.  Also, he had been using a phone card at a pay phone and with his cell phone to call her.  Anyway, when I found the e-mails I totally flipped out.        I had been lied to and didn't know the truth until I played detective.  We have been married for 6 and a half years (5 and a half at the time) and our relationship was always good and we were really close and he was always supportive.  We always knew what the other was doing, had open lines of communication, but something did start to suffer.  I was in school full-time and working full-time and didn't have the energy to put as much into the marriage during that time.  This woman came on strong and I guess he gave in because of our lack of closeness at the time.  I'm not excusing it, just trying to fix it.       I didn't kick him out because I was trying to be rational and think logically.  I presently knnow his e-mail passwords and check them on a daily basis.  Our phone records don't show any calls or texts.  My concern is that he is using a phone card again, or has an e-mail address that I don't know about.  I want to trust him, but after being lied to and starting to heal only to have the total truth come out set me into a crazy state.       He still acts weird.  In hindsight the signs were definitely there, but because I trusted him so much I overlooked a lot of things.  A lot of signs of him cheating are still here, but I don't know if it's my paranoia of being totally blindsided by him, or if they are significant things.  I find myself thinking: "Would I have dismissed what he just said if it was before all this?"  FOR EXAMPLE:  We call each other when we get out of work and if the other doesn't answer it's because they're not done and we talk when we get a chance.  A couple of years ago if he called me at 5:15  (he's done with work at 5) I would have thought nothing of it.  Now I'm thinking that he's getting with this co-worker in the basement for 15 minutes and that's what's making him late to leave.  All crazy thoughts go through my head and I'm going insane.  When I confront him with my fears (such as leaving late), it seems to annoy him.  My view is that he's benig defensive because he's trying to make me into the bad guy so I lay off of trying to find the truth.  Or maybe his view is that he's very sorry for what he did and when I bring up something indicating that he is unfaithful he gets mad because it's not true.  He always tended to be defensive about certain things, but not when he knew he was right.        In all honesty, I know his work schedule, I've been at get-togethers of his work friends, I know when he leaves the house and he calls me when he gets to work and it takes the appropriate time to get there and everything, but my gut tells me something is still wrong.  He gets a break around 2 until 3 pm and that's when I really don't know what he's actually doing.  I've gone as far as telling him I have a job interview to make him believe I won't be in the area so I can stake out the parking lot and watch his car to see if he leaves during his break.  I call his work to make sure that even if I see his car that he didn't leave with someone else.  Last Saturday he caught me spying on him and he didn't seem to happy.  In fact he was pretty darn pissed.  Again, was he pissed because it's getting harder and harder for him to get away with anything, or is it because it hurts that I don't trust him enough to subject myself to sitting outside to spy on him?      I'm afraid that in our conversations I have given away a lot of my insecurties that he can now use against me.  Example:  you act different still or we hardly joke around anymore.  Then when he does joke or act like his old self I view it as a way to throw me off the trail of what he's really doing.  Like if he acts like how I want him to I won't know about what he is really doing.      I know this is extremely long, but please ladies (or gentlemen), if you've been blind-sided by a spouse or significant other, please share what you did to get over it.      Am I being paranoid, or is this gut feeling real?  I am a person that finds it hard to trust and after being lied to I have a real hard

20090225082446AAAnlfb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I fell in love with a married man..... (please, no mean comments.)?	About 6 months ago I was freshly divorced. This guy I met at my daughter's school was going through the same divorce BS I just went through. We started talking and emailing more and got together and we were intimate.       This has lasted now for 6 months and Iam completely head over heels in love with him. He is still married. I broke it off with him this morning, the most horrible thing I ever had to do. No good could have ever come from this. But at the time I be live we filled each other's needs....       The problem is I have become friends with his wife. Do I come clean and tell her? What should I do? My heart is just breaking.       Please please dont judge me and post mean comments

20090225083143AAYeKjP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Will I be allowed to move out? please help?	I am 15 years old, and I would very much like to move away from my home and in with my grandma.  This is no new issue, and I am just not getting the guts to take action in my situation.  I live with 30+ animals (I lost count) including about 10 ducks, 3 roosters, 5 hens, and countless birds.  I live in the city, and all of these animals are living inside my house.  meaning they "go" where ever and whenever they please, and it does not get cleaned regularly.  Some of these animals bite, and the biggest rooster draws blood, and the biggest duck leaves dark large bruises that last a week and a half at least.  The surroundings of my house depress me, and this does not fail to show.  I live with my little brother, step dad, and mother.  My mother takes narcotics on a daily basis, and its obvious in her actions.  Her mood swings never cease, no matter what the conditions may be at the time.  I am often grounded severely for little to no reason, such as leaving a dish on the coffee table (when there are many more that are not mine to accompany it) and getting grounded from tv, phone, computer, and going anywhere (when I am the one who cleans up most of the time anyway). I have a block on my phone that only allows me to use it when she wants me to, and allows her to see who and when I contact people.  I am a straight A student, and I am not "out of control" in any way.  I do not do drugs, I do not drink, or anything of the sort, yet I am still treated as if I cannot be trusted in any way at all.  If I am allowed to go anywhere social, I must first clean the whole downstairs area, (including the animal feces, food, dishes, eggs, and messy towels that cover the floor) sometimes after doing this, I am not even allowed to do what I was told I could.  Currently, I have to go to my grandma's house to help her out, and last night I was told to clean my mother's room to be able to go (just to go clean some more somewhere else) and now of course the situation has been changed and I have to clean the refrigerator as well. please, these living conditions depress me and I would very much like to leave. I have a social worker I could talk to, but I haven't yet. also, I would add, about a year ago, I started cutting. when my mom found out, everything that I liked was taken away from me (including even my guitars) and I was not allowed contact with any of my friends, or my boyfriend (of 16 months now) who was the one who helped me stop.  (I stopped long before my mom found out). She kept telling me how pathetic I was for making them spend money to have me taken to a doctor, and I was told over and over that I was going to be sent to an institution.  Obviously, at the time I needed the most help and support and love, it was not there for me. If I go to the social worker, I will say I want to move out due to emotional abuse and unhealthy living conditions.

So, I called twice again at night with same results and left a text to call me back. However, it's been almost 2 days and no call back yet. Is it safe to call again? or should I wait for a call back?

20090227123336AACaMUe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Guys What does this mean?	Why would a guy say " who are you talking about?" when just a week earlier he told you the name of an attractive female co worker when asked who is she? Then when you mention her by name he says that, as if he is struggling to remember who that could be. He works with her several days a week. Does that mean he really doesn't care who she is or he wants you to think he doesn't think about her enough to remember her name right away when you mention it?

20090227121502AARAcYH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife left me a secret sticker.  What does this mean?	My wife and I haven't been getting along well in years.  I'm a horny romantic and she's the queen of england.  During marriage counseling I said it would be nice if she called me once in awhile, especially when I'm on a long buisness trip.  Or, any other small sign of affection that isn't required and has nothing to do with "pick the kids up at school" or "light bulb needs changing in the bathroom".      Well, a few days ago I noticed on my car keys there was a little round sticker.  It's a tiny picture of a heart with a keyhole in the middle.  She stuck it on the key fob.      I asked my kids and they said they didn't put it there and don't know anything about it.      Does this mean:   1.  my wife loves me   2.  my wife is just doing what I asked in counseling so that she can say she listened   3.  my wife is trying to rig the key fob so that it jams in the ignition and I get trapped in the car and die   4.  my wife would like to have sex in the backseat of the car   5.  my wife plans to have sex with me this weekend, and this was foreplay   6.  my wife would like me to bring the key fob to bed and use it to open her heart up   7.  my wife accidentally dropped the sticker and it landed on my key fob.   8.  the kids are lying and they stuck it there   9.  my wife's friend stuck it there to suggest I drive over to her place    10.  a light bulb needs changing in the bathroom and this is a new way of communicating it.      What do you think is the situation?

We have been divorced about 5 or 6 years now. He is has been married to someone now for a couple of years and they have two children. We have a son together who is in the Army now.

20090227121849AAEOnSu	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think my neighbour or my ex. buglarized my home? Help?	My neighbor and I have enemies from day one.  These people are cold hearted and always looking for fights with my family.  My ex. and I were together when my home was burglarized.  Everything between us was fine, until things started going missing.  The things that were first noticed missing were some stored boxes with valuables in the basement.  Some clothing, linen, etc. from the master bedroom went missing as well on another occasion.  These things went missing gradually over a couple years.  No doors or windows were ever broken or left open.  My bf had didn't drive though had access to the key few times.  My neighbor drives has access to my backyard, front and back door (has motive).  My bf new some contents of boxes but no means or motive to steal.  My neighbor is sneaky and a bright fellow with possible connections.  The puzzling part of this is that no electronics such as stereo, computers, cameras went missing or money.  I suspect both but, who do you guys think was involved?

20090227122950AAEN2jE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this really a healthy relationship?	Just to give you a background to this one, I met my boyfriend when I was 15, we were together for just under 2 years, but split up because he had sexual contact with another girl and I couldn't forgive him for it. 3 years on, we came back into contact and I have forgiven him for his infidelity, we have now been back together for just under 4 months, but what was like a fairytale in the beginning seems to have turned pretty sour pretty quickly.    There are several issues already, such as the fact the when I put myself down, he doesn't ever tell me I'm wrong, which therefore makes me feel worse about myself. I consider him to be more attractive than me anyway, and therefore this makes my insecurities worse.   He has what he calls a really good friend, who is another girl, who he was in a short term relationship with just after we broke up. I am not overly happy about this, because in my opinion, if there was something between them in the first place, I can't see how so much could have changed. She is going to stay at his house tonight.       The issue really is that he has now told me that she doesn't know that we are back together, and he has no plans to tell her or his mother, as he is 'not ready', he will not give me any reasons why and says that this is my insecurity and he shouldn't have to justify his actions to me.      Am I in the wrong here, like he says, or is his behavior unreasonable?

20071025214012AACVOt0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when you don't know what to do?	Basically, here's some advice to everyone. Haha. Never revisit an ex. Ever. I learned that the hard way.      Anyways, I hadn't seen my ex in a long time, but decided to last week. We kind of got sexual and stuff - and me, being an idiot - thought he was going to ask me back out. He didn't.       He told me, "I think I can only see you when I'm horny." Is it wrong for me to have replied, "I don't want to talk to you or see you anymore" and completely shut him out of my life?      Besides that, I've been completely bored. I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be looking for a new boyfriend or just sit at home and make paper cranes to occupy my time. Relationships have only proven to me that right now I'm not ready for one. How should I live my everyday life without having an urge to date someone again? I don't want to talk to my ex, honestly, but I feel in a desperate mood right now. =/

Mesmo em distancia ou?o    As batidas do teu cora??o    Gritando meu nome...      E quando respondo    à cada uma destas chamadas   Timidamente você se esconde,    Fingindo-se forte diante de mim!      Nem sequer, nota minha fragilidade…   Minha vontade de você!      Cinicamente,   Olhá-me entre as pernas e sentes   Aquele que te implora e foges, omitindo-se...      Enganando seus próprios anseios por mim      Quais palavras terei que usá-las    Para quebrar teu acanhamento   Que n?o admite que assumas       Que teu maior desejo, sou eu!      O mel da boca que matá-lhe a sede,   O paladar da essência que degustas,   O gozo do prazer que te completa,   O enigma no qual arrebenta-te em êxtases...      Sou eu!      Com quais palavras despertarei teu amor    Que faz teu cora??o dormir       Enquanto teu silêncio faz intimidar    Tuas iniciativas em mim?…      Quantos enganos viverás    Até que percebas que somos únicos,      Que somos a jun??o exata    De uma única complementa??o?...

Um divórcio assim n?o se supera, a gente muda os objetivos, muda os caminhos, muda a vida, mas as marcas ficam. O amor n?o acaba, mesmo quando a decep??o foi muito grande, mas ele se acomoda num cantinho e fica lá adormecido até aparecer um novo amor.   A gente se torna exigente e cauteloso, por medo de sofrer outra vez. Mas o cora??o tem raz?es que a própria raz?o desconhece, e um belo dia alguém aparece e se faz merecedor e tudo recome?a, um novo amor, uma nova vida, muito mais seguro e verdadeiro eu acho.   E assim foi comigo, e hoje eu estou ainda recolhendo pedacinhos do divórcio,  mas amando e sendo amada.          Ps: Este texto é de uma amiga do YR e fez bem para mim.   Copiei para compartilhar com vocês.   Muito obrigado querida " morena..... ".

Proibi ele de falar com gurias.   Me acho feia: sempre acho que as outras gurias s?o mais bonitas do que eu, n?o sei porque sou assim, tenho uma auto- estima muito baixa, acho tudo que é defeito em mim que todos dizem que n?o existem mas n?o consigo pensar que sou mais eu ou confiar no meu taco, como muitos me dizem. Meu namorado diz que me ama, mas como sei que ele era terrivel antes de me conhecer, fico com muito medo de servir de otária dele, tipo de ele me trair, como traiu a ex, e isso q ele gostava dela e ela era tri pra ele.   PODERIAM ME DAR SUAS OPINI?ES PARA RESOLVER ESTES PROBLEMINHAS?

20070822211757AAgc0Ya	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend having 30 life crisis. Ran away, slept with someone else. What to do?	Sorry - this may be a bit long. But please help me. I am so confused.   We have been together for four years. We live together. He is the best thing that ever happened to me.    He started a new job about a year ago that is really intense and time demanding. It puts a lot of pressure on him. He goes away a lot for work and has lots of night work functions.    His father cheated on his mother when he was younger and he (used) to be really dark on people that cheat. His best friend cheated on his girl a few years back and he was really unforgiving. No excuse etc.   His father died when he was young and he has issues from that that I do not think he has dealt with.   He turned 30 in March and has been having a 'mini mid life crisis' ever since. Whenever things get too much he runs away. All his past relationships have ended because everything in his life got too much and he would run away overseas.    He is a total Mummies boy. He can be incredibly selfish.

20070831165922AAPXqbt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Gente...n?o sei o que fazer, estou muito triste...o que vocês fariam se vocês estiverem na minha situa??o???	Faz mais de 1 ano e meio que conheci um alem?o, e a gente come?o a sair, com o tempo ele se apaixonou por min e eu por ele. Mais eu sabia que ele ia voltar para a sua terra natal para terminar o seus estudos. Eu moro na Arg e quando ele voltou para Alemanha eu pensei que a historia ia acabar, mas foi o contrario, ele n?o parou de ligar para mim, e ele planejo uma viajem de volta para me visitar. (ele ficou na Alemanha 10 meses). Nas conversas ele dizia que ele me amava, que sentia muitas saudades e que ele queria se casar comigo. Ali ele voltou para Argentina faz um mês e meio e nós ficamos juntos por 2 semanas. Depois ele foi para o Br porque ele ta fazendo um estágio na inatel. (ele diz que ele consegue ou aquele estagio para ficar perto de min) Faz um mês que ele foi, e ele mudou um monte...ent?o eu perguntei ele como a gente continua a historia. Ele n?o sabia que me dizer e hoje ele diz que a melhor coisa e que a gente termine tudo, porque ele já n?o tem certeza de sue amor por min

Member since: September 03, 2007    Total points: 97 (Level 1)    Points earned this week:      --% Best answer         :)   S Is this age difference weird?   Would a 15 year old going out with an 18 year old be weird?   I know that the 18 year old would be considered illegal. But Im talking in terms as if that was not a law. I mean seriously you know how many people are dating "illegally"          Dont worry guys, Im not the type of girl to do stuff. I'll stick with kissing thanks.   I'd say we both have alot in common and get along great. He doesnt seem like the type to pressure me, and defiantly isnt a stupid immature kid.       Im pretty mature for my age, I'll admit, I can be immature, but for the most part Im not an idiot.   BTW, Im 15 and a girl..hes the 18 year old.

20070906123130AAvQFP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	RePost:  GUYS ONLY PLEASE!!!!! I saw him online…should I say something?	I hate to ask again but I don’t think I was clear the last time: Q: Should I say something to him? What should I say?      Guys only please!! I already talked about this with my gf’s-I only need guys opinions now.         Ok: I’ve been out with this guy I met online 4 times and we’ve slept together (don’t judge, girls have needs too!) I hid my profiles but he's still actively online and I think, has created a profile on a different site now. I saw him there and unhid my profile. He called within 10 minutes, but didn’t say anything about it. (and I was a little cold, so I think he knows I saw him).       He tells me I’m hot and that he really likes me, so I don’t get why he’s still looking. I wouldn’t normally care after only 4 dates, but we’ve had sex now (6 times) and I feel weird that he’s still looking. I’d prefer not to sleep with him if he’s sleeping with or dating other people.       So again:  Should I say something about seeing him online? What should I say?      Thanks for your help!

20070908130244AAitKKJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I date a younger guy ??	I met this guy on a internet chat, we became chat buddies for a couple months, we then started calling each other, for a few more months, then we met. he lives in cali and I live in las vegas. The first time we met we instantly clicked. he's 23 and I'm 28, I have 2 kids and he has none, evenwith these differences we get along so good, we can conversate about anything. Somewhere between the talking on the phone and our first meeting we fell in love. We talk to each other 2-3 times a day, and see each other every couple weekends. my sons adore him and he adores my sons. He wants to take it to the next level. He asked me if I would consider moving to california with him, I mean this long distance thing can't go forever. I talked to my sons and they said they really like him and they would love to live in california, and I very much wanna be with him full time, the thing is, I'm worried I move down there and people start telling us we shouldn't be together cuz of the age and children issue
20070908193933AA3dauu	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I quite the plays and basketball team at my school, so i can work for my own money?	I would probably be returning to JV basketball this year, as i still am not ready for varsity. also, i have been involved in plays, and the new teacher seems very experienced. I would have a real chance, after doing shakespeare, as well as being in choir for a year already, since we're doing musicals. however, i need to get a job for my mom to trust me and get me a car, cuz she won't let me buy one w/out permission. and then i would need money to pay for gas and insurance. plus my mom supports 8 ppl, including two babies. so i usually have to wait for good sums of money. i would probably end up working in food, or target, or a video store. help?
20071215101638AAC9ZZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Christmas present for girl that is a very likely girlfriend to-be in the future. good idea?	Me and this girl really like eachother, and we've tried to go out before, didn't work. We are working on it again, and so i've decided on a present that i'd like to give her for christmas. i was thinking of buying a bunch of kisses and hugs (the chocolates if u didn't know), 2 different colors, and putting them in a box, (there's a story behind the kisses) I would make one of the colors shaped as a heart in the center and put the rest filling in the  box. Then i was going to put a card that said somewhat of a clue to look under the lid of the box, and there would be mistletoe, so that when she picked it from the box, i'd kiss her. this is also her first kiss, so i wouldn't make it too deep of a kiss. opinions?

It was kind of a 'short and sweet' type of relationship..it wasn't really serious -although I kind of wish it was, since I ended up falling in love with him!We didn't really do anything together due to the fact we live in different towns & I was a little insecure about what my parent's would think of him if they met, or heard about him..so I kept the whole thing a secret, and didn't really having any communication other than School & MSN with him... So basically my parents were the only ones who didn't know about him.Since the breakup I've still have had many thoughts and feelings towards him. We're still pretty good friends, and he treats me very well, and we sometimes find ourselves 'cuddling' together. I don't know If hes aware of my feelings..and I really want to tell him how i feel..but should I? I don't want to creep him out or anything..      what are your thoughts?

20080217010950AA2cyp6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do when I meet my boyfriend for the first time?	I have been dating my boyfriend online for about 7 months, and have known him here for almost 4 years... In may I will be driving a couple states over to stay with him and his family... I'm really nervous for a few reasons. One being the obvious, that we have never met in person, the closest would be webcamming, so I'm nervous about that of course. But also, I am an alcoholic, and I have been sober for the last 4 months, this will be the first sober relationship I have been in since I was 15 years old (I'm 23 now.) It makes me feel like a child again, like I don't know what to do... To be honest, as lame as it sounds, I don't even know how to "put the moves" on a guy unless I'm drunk!! So sad... but anyways, does anyone have any advice for me?

20080305173730AAd7CiS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal?	I've been with my boyfriend for over a year,    and he's fingered me before, but it just kind of hurt and i didn't get anything out of it.   He wants to try just putting his hands down my pants and like messing with my clitoris. I want him to, because I know it will feel alot better, but do other people do that?   Like is that considered fingering? And also, do you think it will feel better than it has when he fingered me, and could it possibly even make me orgasm? I've never had an orgasm before so i don't really know what it would be like. How do you know when you have one?   BTW- I'm not having sex until I'm married, no matter what. So please dont say i should just have sex.    Thank you for serious answers :]

My ex split up with me 2 mos ago because we were arguing a lot. He'd been acting distant and I wasn't happy... so it's true we weren't doing well. But we have a young son so I never expected him to suddenly end the relationship after 10 yrs.       He said he wasn't happy and that the arguing wasn't good for our son so he had to leave. He refused to try counseling.      3 days later I get a text from the cell company saying our bill is $500.00 I went online and discovered he'd been texting/talking to a 20 yr old (he's 34) at his work for well over a month non-stop. Sometimes hundreds of x a day back and forth. He was hiding this from me.      He denies he cheated or is seeing her. He says they are friends and were talking. Then he said that now that we're broken up it's none of my business. And yes he likes her but he's not going to hook up with her. He says I'm not entitled to answers anymore. And feels he did nothing wrong. I feel burned and confused. He says he's "done" with me and...

20081115195016AAcrYFD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	No more hope... Any encouraging words?	And as I wrote that question, I realized I was only 21... The thing is that people would say I'm ugly when I was in high school and being stupid, I let it affect me A LOT. After graduation, somehow my looks became better. I got a few boyfriends. However, the longest relationship I had was 3 months. I was seeing a guy for about 5 months. It wasn't supposed to be exclusive and I was seeing another guy from time to time but I ended up falling in love with the first guy. One day, we decided to make it official. He wasn't that very convinced though but he said yes. Then a week later, he said he couldn't do it. I didn't want to deal with someone who doesn't want to commit so I said **** it and let him go. Two weeks later, he made it official with a girl. They've been a couple officially for 5 months now... And somehow, it still hurts...   After it happened, i started to feel like in high school. It's still like that now. I feel ugly and depressed and I can't get out of that feeling...   Do you have any encouraging words? lol. I'm really wondering if anyone will wanna be with me for a long time. I'm 21 and my longest relationship was 3 months. (if i count the guy who didnt want to commit, yet "dated" me, the number would go up to 6 months... not that long either). ARGH, im fed up. Help...

20081122050146AANLMmF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can women be so darn confusing?	I am a single dad that met a nice single mom a few weeks ago through a mutual friend. I am pretty shy and it has been a while (since February) since I have gone out with a woman, but we had a really nice time over dinner and some drinks. We went out again and had a nice time again. Since then (about 3 weeks ago), she has been sick, had a death in the family and pretty busy due to work. We had some really nice conversations, but have not heard from her since early last week. I try calling about every 2 or 3 days, but she does not return my calls. I saw her this week at a function for my daughter and she acknowledged that she got my calls and has been running behind on things. It was a pretty nice conversation and said we would get together later. Tried calling again after that and still no response.       Not sure what to make of this here. There is a fine line being between assertive/proactive and pushy/invasive and I have erred on the side of caution in this case. I never want to be ‘that’ guy. She has her own life and I’ve called a couple of times, so she knows how to get in touch with me. She seems excited via e-mail or phone to get together again, but no response when I call. I think I am getting the shaft here, but thought by our age (mid 30’s) she would have the decency to let me know of that. I’ve been that way with women I have met since my divorce.       Is this behavior normal? Her behavior seems a little bit rude and uncharacteristic of what I initially thought of her. Maybe she just isn’t that great? Maybe she is confused and needs some space? Maybe she is just testing me.  I'm inclined to stop calling her and let the ball be in her court.  Any advice would be great - not sure where anything went wrong.       Thanks

20081004184209AAtQY0l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and this guy.....?	i met this guy at a party in july and we didn't really talk to much but our friends were all hanging out together so that's how we met. when i left, my friend texted me later and said the guy thought i was hot and she gave me his number. so i texted him and we talked over text and a tiny bit over the phone until late august and we started school together. i was so excited because i was really starting to get a crush on him. but on the first week of school i saw him and got so nervous that i just turned around. we kept talking over text and we would see each other at school but just pretend we didnt notice each other and walk away but sometimes we'd just smile or wave or say hi as we passed. so its been 3 months since we've met and i STILL like him and we still text almost everday. so last week his friend came up to me and said that the guy liked me and i should go to homecoming with him. i am really surprised and i really like him but its just awkward because we are both really shy and are to scared i guess to actually have a conversation so that we can become more then just phone buddies. Any tips or input??

20081028214148AAThAXQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I email or call my old boyfriend?	I have my old boyfriend as a friend on facebook. I am dying to talk to him and find out how he is and what he is doing. I spoke to him once last year because someone passed away that we both loved. But that was the first time I had spoken to him in about 7 years. He was a big deal boyfriend, we were engaged for a while after dating for 6 years. I miss how much he made me laugh and I would love to just talk and talk and talk to him and laugh like that again.  But...he was not right for me..kind of a jerk in too many ways and we probably would be divorced right now if we had gotten married. I did actually marry the right guy who I love very much, and my husband is the reason I have not emailed or contacted my old boyfriend again. But oh I miss laughing like I did when I used to talk to him. Would it be awful if I contacted him again?

20081007091004AAZkO5W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I ask a girl out if i only have a class with her once a week?	This is my first year of college and i'm out of my element, and I hardly know anyone.       Theres this girl in my English class that I started to get a crush on since the beginning of the year in September. I could tell she was my type just by our discussions in class. Usually i would try to flirt with her after class walking through the halls until next class, but its too brief, and i never have enough time.       The class is 3 times a week, with tests on the 3rd day, and she now only shows up to the last class for the tests, because we basically do nothing in the other classes.       After this test class we both have a 3hr break before the next our class, so i try to finish my test at the same time as her so i can walk with her but shes always leaving to go home for the 3hr break, so i don't have any time to ask her out or anything.      I can't flirt with her in class cuz its a test and you cant talk, and I want to ask her out in the brief time we have after class before she leaves, but i don't want to seem desperate or w/e. But its the only class i have with her so its the only chance i get to talk to her.      We both smoke weed every once and a while we talked about it in class before (Don't Judge me, i'm Canadian, everyone does it up here, its like drinking.)  So i was thinkin i could ask her if she wanted to go get stoned during the 3hr break or sumthin.. i dunno, i kinda don't want to ask her out in that way cuz it seems weird. but its the only way i can do it without sounding desperate since we hardly know eachother.       I need help, maybe some advice what i should say to ask her out?

She told me a bunch of lies, and basically just dumped me out there. We decided to give it another try, so we've been talking on myspace. She said she was never going to lie to me again. Now I admit, she has been upfront. She made a fake myspace of another girl and started flirting with me on it, so I flirted back. Now she thinks I would cheat on her. I don't cheat, it's happened to me before and i'd never do that. I was just playing around with this "fake" girl. She made it to see if I would flirt back or if I would say I had a girlfriend. How can I fix this situation? I said I was sorry a million times.

Dia juga sulit orgasme walaupun clitorisnya besar.      Sedangkan pacarku yang sekarang justru sulit sekali jika ditusuk Mr Happy. Butuh waktu 1 menit untuk benar-benar bisa menembusnya dengan susah payah dan dia terlihat seperti orang tersedak. Padahal dia benar-benar terangsang dan basah, dan clitorisnya pun kecil. Tapi setelah beberapa menit, segalanya menjadi lancar.      Pertanyaannya:   1. Mengapa perbedaan antara longgar dan sempit begitu kentara?   2. Pada usia pacaran ke berapa sih rata-rata cowok bisa memperawani pacarnya? Pacar ke 1 bisa ditiduri setelah pacaran 3 bulan, dan yang ke 2 setelah 5 bulan. Apakah ini terlalu cepat atau terlalu lambat?      Maaf, saya mau berdiskusi, bukan minta dinasehati untuk segera kawin dsb.

20080926225445AASPoUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont understand what he means?	Ok this is going to sound childish.   I finally had my first kiss by a guy I really like and I thought he liked me back right, we hang out and everything.   Well yesterday, I got a messege from him on myspace telling me to go to his myyearbook profile and look at his name.   In his name it said    (enter his name)(a few band names)(Ms.Rae owns "enter his last name here")   Sorry, no one is looking up our sites...   Well Rae is my nickname and so I thought he meant that he wants to be my boyfriend.   So I wrote him back and he said, that hes not afraid to ask me anything but that hes just not ready...<--the dudes had sex before and he says hes nervous?! Im a freakin virgin UGH!      What does he mean?    I know hes "not ready" but he kissed me, jokes around all the time, is really sweet to me, made me dinner and is in a way protective of me....so whats wrong?      (note: I've never had a bf...I can give advice to others perfectly and it always works out for the people I help, whats wrong with me?)
20080930105607AAsfGxg	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to go about doing this?	OK, so I've had this crush on this guy for the past year (little over). We're both involved in theater and did a show together. Since the show ended (October 07), we've seen each other 4 or 5 times, because of mutual friends and such. We're not close friends or anything... but I'm not going to push a romance of any sort right now because I am 16 and he is 20. Right now there is just too big of a gap in age for us to be any more than friends. But I'm going to see him in a few days. So what should I do? I'm not nessesarily shy, but just approaching him and talking to him is awkward for me... what kind of things can I say that will definitely start a conversation between us? Something like "hey 'Jeremy', what have you been up to?"? Or "I heard you are in another show, 'Jeremy'."? I want to say something that will pretty much guarantee a follow-up response, not just "yes" or "no". HELP!?!?!

20081004185204AAOpWE6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl trying to make me jealous?	This girl I like glances at me. She doesn't talk to me casually that much after she got mad at me for being mean to her once, I think she knows I like her. She suddenly started talking to this guy after she got mad at me. He has a similar personality like me and they laugh and seem like having a good time, but only when I'm around them. When I'm not around them and she's near him, she doesn't talk to him. So is this girl trying to make me jealous? Also, when we do group work together (me, the girl, and the guy she talks to), she only talks to me for sharing answers to questions and barely talks to the other guy. They don't even have much in common, since the girl watches a lot of T.V., and the guy barely does and doesn't even have cable. The girl listens to a lot of hip-hop, r&b, and rap, and the boy doesn't.

20081004194106AAg5qlU	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like i'm competing with my best friend for the attention of my best guy friend?	My best friend, and my best guy friend are like 2nd cousins, and me and my best guy friend are closer than her and him, but i always feel like me and my best friend (Sally) are competing for the attention of my best guy friend (James).    I'd rather hang out with guys and James is really fun to hang out with, but if i hang out with Sally and James at the same time its like she wants to talk to him and not me      some examples...   1. we were in the hallway and she doesnt let me walk next to him and she'll walk slower so he'll stay behind with her.   2. if we're at the mall she does the same thing, but i do it too.    we go to a restaurant at the mall and i have to make sure i sit next to him so that i wont be ignored the whole time i'm there   3. i feel like i have to lie when i'm going out because i dont want her to come, because i know if she does, we'll compete.   4. i try to beat her to him in the halls so that i wont be stuck watching them hanging out without me.   5. sometimes i'll know shes talking to him, so i'll look to see what she says, and she'll stop talking... then i look at him and i can tell she started mouthing words to him      i feel like shes talking about me to him half the time and i cant stand the competitiveness between us      shes been my best friend since 1st grade (i'm in 9th)   but half the time she pisses me off

We usually hangout about twice a week. He always comes to me, cus I dont drive. However, I'm the one always calling and asking him when we're gonna hangout. Should I wait and see if he initiates it for once? I dont want to be boring and predictable, plus I'd be nice for him to say that he wants to hangout for once.

Currently we live in different countries and he has promised me he will not communicate with his ex-girlfriend.  I found out that he still talks to her and he admitted it. He said she is his best friend and I am his girl friend and it is difficult for him to break the relationship. His ex is now married but I still don't want him to communicate with her.  They live in the same city. He promised me again, but still I think he does not agree with me that it is not appropriate... Can I get your opinions on this? Thank you

20081021103945AASclhi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Who do you think loves me more?	Okay, since I'm around my early teens, I'm experiencing drama and boy problems.      I tend to tell my mom about it, because she's normally the first one to come home from work. If it's some drama problem, she tells me to temporarily ignore the person, and see what happens. And if I tell her about a guy, she suddenly changes the subject, which confuses me a lot.      Now when I tell my father about drama, he tells me to forget about it and think about something else, and when I come to the point of crying, he does whatever he can to make me stop. (Such as taking me to the store, buying me food, anything) And when I tell him about boys, he tells me to wait a while and decide if the guy's the right one for me.      Based on everything I told you, does it seem like my dad loves me more, or my mother?

We study in diff universities in the state, and it's kinda far from each other. Plus I got close to some of his friends already. I guess we got a little too serious into the rel, not being officially bf/gf.       I wanna break up with him cause he's become controlling and we fight like every week. I wanna end things, but I think I'll miss him too much. I can't help but reminice every night, but this rel'ship is really getting unhealthy, even my friends say so. I don't wanna lose him as a friend.       How do I deal? How do I end it?

20081028153226AAjhDbW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I AM IN LOVE>>>WITH MY OLD TEACHER!?	THIS IS VERY LONG, VERY INTERESTING, AND VERY SAD!! SO PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE YOU ANSWER!         Okay..so when i was in high school i had this teacher who was 39 at the time and i was 14. I never had an attraction to her at first but then it just happened all of a sudden. I fell so so hard for her. I went to her house like everyday after school and we would go to church, go to the movies, and go out to eat. we mostly just hung around her house and just enjoyed each others company. around 10th grade we were at a football game and a man came up to her and asked her out and she asked my permission to go out with him and i was only 15 and so i said i didnt care and she said that i didnt have to worry about anything because they would never get married. After that first date, they got more and more serious about each other and it really really hurt me because im in love with her. Not only did it hurt me the man she went out on the date with told her that she needed to tell on me to the guidance counselor so she did because he threatened to break up with her. About 4 months after they were dating she found out he was cheating on her with his ex wife and automatically came running back to me. she told me she was so sorry for losing me and telling on me and that i was the only one who really cared about her and wanted to be with her and she was exactly right. We got to talking again but then the school found out about it and they got involved and so did the cops. my whole 11th grade year i had her class 1st period and it was like i was at home when i was around her. we had so much fun when other people was around and she would always want me to stay after to talk to me and would write me late passes. after that class it was summer and she started dating this man and he asked her to marry him and she said yes but everytime i would talk to her she would call of the engagement....and it happened 3 times. they finally broke up like 2 weeks before they were gonna get married and they stayed broken up for like 3 months. then like 3 weeks ago i sent her an email saying that i cared for her more than anything or anyone in this world and i sent it to her the email on the her school email....just to make sure she got it and my sister had her first period and she told me she was crying the day she was suppose to get it.....WHY DID SHE CRY? but i never got a reply but she got back with her ex the day after i sent it to her and now is engaged only after 3 weeks and now will not even talk to me or look at me...she will only look at me from a far and now her boyfriend is stalking me......i love her more than anything and this isnt lust or puppy love i am madly deeply in love with her...if God came and told me he was gonna take her i would let him take me instead of her and i just want to be with her for her...if i am with her i know i cant have kids but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make for her and if she told me she never wanting to have sex then i could live without it for the rest of my life....tell me what i should do...i have told me parents and they know everything and they said if i am happy then they are to....and dont give me the whole you should get over her.!!! WHY DID SHE GET ENGAGED SO QUICKLY OR GET BACK WITH HER EX SO QUICKLY? DO YOU THINK SHE IS SCARED OF HER REPUTATION? Everything i wrote in here i just a little description of what has happened. I can really live life without having sex and kids as long as i have her by my side. I do have a mom and i do not have issues...Just my heart is telling me to go for her and i love her more than anything? I SERIOUSLY WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER I LOVE HER EXISTANCE!!!      she has 2 kids...one kid doesnt care about it and the other is totally against it...do u think this could be a reason, she is not with me?      and also all her previous relationships her boyfriends have hit her and verbally abused her or cheated on her....do you think she is scared of commitment with me because i really do care about her and she knows i would never do that?         her kids are younger than me....      She cant lose her job because 18 in the legal age now! But if she did i could support her, because that would be my number 1 priority!      I dont go to that school anymore!      the feeling were mutual! now i have no clue. do you think i should wait on her, because she is the only one for me and i know it...and i know that letter had to touch her...what do you think?

20081107133238AAXCCIk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Hubby's mental illness becoming apparent; what should I do?	My hubby is a 25 year old Korean man, and I am a 29 year old Caucasian female. We both met while attending law school at Berkeley, and my hubby is the most gentle, quiet, and kind person I have ever met to date. The problem, though, is that he is a bit too smart for his own good (he graduated with a 3.9 GPA from Yale University at age 21 with degrees in physics and economics), and he suffers from schizoaffective disorder, which is sort of like a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.      My hubby is usually normal as he takes his medication as prescribed, but when the effects begin to wear off, he begins to act very delusional. He'll start shouting at protesters on television, asking, "What have I done? What did I do to you?", and he'll often come to me crying, begging me not to leave him (I don't know why he does that; I love him so much, and I would never leave him). His co-workers have also called me, expressing concern that he's "acting out" at work, asking his manager why he was conspiring to kill him and other nonsense.      I'm getting really worried because I truly love my hubby, and I don't think his meds are beginning to wear off. I'm also worried about our 2 year old daughter because my hubby sometimes acts irrational around her as well.      What should I do? I often fall into depression myself because half of the time, my hubby becomes the man that I didn't marry. It hurts me a lot when he comes up to me, thinking for some crazy reason that I would leave him, when I told him several times that I never would.      I called his psychiatrist, and he said that because of his schedule, the earliest appointment he could make would be late next week, but I don't know if I can take the stress and pain for another week. What should I do?

20081108222030AAHQ5YE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ack, A little advice on how I should react to this?	I'll call the guy H. For privacy matters.   Ok, so last year this guy named H and I really did not like each other, he would tease me and I would swear and tease back (in a really mean way, not like flirting). It got to points where we would honestly try to trip each other in the halls or kick each other. So, it was definitely not in a flirty way. But this year, I don't know. We have to sit next to each other in a couple classes, but he isn't mean at all this year. So I decided not to be mean, and now when I'm doing work, I'll feel someone looking at me and when I look up, he always turns his head away really quick.      A day ago in Math, one of my many retarded friends (in a good way) was commenting on random peoples eye color,so H, me, and 2 of my friends were talking about it, and looking at each others eyes. It was really weird because when I was looking at his eyes, he blushed, a really, really red color.   But he's dating someone else already (for like 2 or 3 weeks). Does anybody know how to react to this? Because I know I don't know.
20081111215112AAu2ozR	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think? (10 points)?	Do you think this is a healthy relationship? This woman(28) is married to a man (also 28) who shes been with since high school. He was a pothead in high school and still is one now. They had a kid when they were 15 and she lived with her grandparents so they sent the kid to live with her parents in another country. Then she got pregnant again at 18, 21 and lastly at 24 all for the same guy. When the 1st kid turned 10 he moved back to live with his parents. The father of the kids is always drinking around them (he doesn't get hardcore drunk, just tipsy) and he tries to get the younger ones to curse. Do you think this is a good situation for both the parents and kids?
20081114073140AA6Ig9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP I LOST MY GIRLFRIEND?	i have posted before, but i didnt get the info right, please take the time to read this. I have been dating my girlfriend for 5 months and we broke up last week.  We were great for the first 3 and then she suspected that i liked another woman. i assured her that i didnt and i would break contact with her.  a few weeks passed and the girl she thought i liked called to tell  me something, it was only a 10 mins phone call and it wasnt even on a friendly basis and when my girlfriend found out she told me she could no longer trust me, things were bad ever since then.  She no longer seems attracted to me, sex is almost non existant and she seems to just no longer desire me.  This made me severely insecure and i began to act different, we both love eachother very much and she said she wants us to have a 2nd chance but she doesnt know if she will ever feel the same, we still talk every night and we hang out on weekends.  What should i do, should i just give up and move on or should i wait and try to be myself again and give it time.  Im scared to stay attached if its not going to work, but she means everything to me and i will do anything i can to get her back.  Should i give it time, is there any hope?

20081115091955AA7HICd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any guesses as to why my boyfriend hasn't kissed me yet and/or how to solve it?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 months now but he hasn't kissed me yet.  It would be my first kiss so I would much rather he kiss me, especially considering I know that he has kissed, at least, another girl before.  I think I'm the most serious relationship he's had so far and I can tell he really really likes me so I'm wondering if maybe he's worried that I might not want to be kissed and he doesn't want to scare me off or something.  At first I thought maybe there just hadn't been "the right moment" yet, because at first we hadn't really done any dates out by ourselves but that's no longer the case.  It's not like we're distant, we are really comfortable with hugging and getting close but whenever we say goodbye, he always just kisses me on the cheek or the forehead or the nose (lingering kisses), but never the mouth.  He's not the most outgoing person but he's not shy like I am, so I'm not so sure that's the problem.  I think maybe he's worried about my shyness, I mean, I have issues with eye contact so I always look away when we're saying goodbye but I've gotten really comfortable at looking him in the eye when we're just chilling and such.  It's just always one my mind lately, I mean, I'm 17 and he's my first boyfriend (the shyness thing) and not only have I been dreaming of my first kiss forever but I like him so much and just would like to share this with him.  But I don't want to ruin it in my own head by asking him about it and maybe forcing the kiss... has anyone else had this kind of problem before?  Should I just wait it out or what?
20081115193926AARK0kC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a good idea? Please be honest.?	Ok so me and my gf are on a break and i really want to convince her that i love her and that me and her should be together.      Now this is my plan.      She lives just over a 100miles away      My plan is to buy some flowers and another pressie (prob jewerly) and drive up there with one of my mates who plays guitar. Im going to knock on the door give her the flowers then step back and bust out 'The Scientist' with me on vocals and my mate on guitar. Then im going to tell her i love her and that i believe in my heart that me and her are right for eachother and that we can make this work. THEN im going to get down on one knee and ask her to marry me.      If she looks a lil shocked and if it took her too much by surprise then ill let her know tht i am willing to wait for an answer and also i would like her to be honest so if she doesnt want me then i would let her know that she could just tell me.      Now i understand tht this could be the happiest or the most humilating moment of my life but im willing to take that risk for her because she is my world.      Please tell me if you think its a good idea.      BE honest please      Thanx in advance
20081119223057AAFF8L2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend needs a "break". Please help me. I'm going insane!!!?	We've only been dating for a little while.. But we are both in love with each other, and both agree that it feels so right with each other. Everything was perfect for the whole time, until that one night. She tells me she needs to talk to me, and that her brother just got into a major car accident. He broke ribs, arms, legs, etc. And it was all intentional by the opposite driver. She then proceeds to tell me she isn't ready for a serious relationship.. We continued to talk, and she told me she just wants a break.. a "Vacation". She said she'd be ready in the future (pitching Summer '09 at me). Implying I don't HAVE to wait, but if I do, she'll get back together with me. She then asks me if I can come over to keep her company, and help her through this. I thought maybe she wants to be "boyfriend free" so she can help her brother through this? I don't see any other reason why? There is no other guys, she thinks I'm perfect, and she's in love with me!!      How do I interpret this? I don't want to wait until summer to be intimate with her! But if I do wait, I don't want to lose her. Is my thinking she might get with some other guy legit? Or just me being insecure?      I'm losing my mind! I can't sleep, eat, or have any fun! Please help!

20090220173151AAPd3Dg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who is willing to listen to my sad story?	Well, Im in love with a guy. Im willing to do anything for him. Which i have proven to him many times since i have take all this crap from him. He treated me like dirt. I finally decided to say something and for the past two days he's been ok.      Here comes the sad story part.....      Ok so last night we get together because i needed help on making a website and he is good at that stuff.(not the point) He doesnt show up at my house till 11:45pm. There are no places open that have WIFI. So we go to denny's and we start talking. So i mentioned to him that im glad he has been nice to me for the past two days. Somehow we start talking about our feelings for each other. (yes he does know that im madly in love with him). Anyways, (oh one more thing he is an ex bf and we just recently started talking again after 5 years of not). Anyways I tell him that the reason he wont admit his true feelings towards me is because he is scared of getting hurt again. Then he says" The feelings are there Helen, however I will never act upon them" So i get upset and i grab the bill and go pay. Then i walk out into freezing cold, cuz i was ready to walk home, even though my house is like 5 miles from the restaurant. He stops me, i also realize that my house keys are still in his car. Anyways, so we start talking, and he goes "I think you missunderstood what i said" And i told him no i heard him loud and clearly. Then he asks whether im sure we just cant be friends with benefits and i tell him no. He goes well then there are two options. I was like yeah yeah either i stay friends with you and continue let you have it your way where i constantly get hurt, or we stop all contacts. He goes no he goes well either we stay friends or I unlock my feelings for you. So then there is a long pause. and he goes F**k helen, i cant get you out of my head, i think about you too. He goes i need a drink, so we go to a bar. Anyways he has a few drinks, and i ask him what option do you choose. And he is like i dont wanna talk about this just shut up. Arg so w/e he starts driving to my house. So i tell him w/e i give up. But the thing is everytime i tell him i give up he doesnt want me to He says no dont give up. So he drives me towards my house, but instead goes to this dead end place. Then he goes, helen dont give up, your efforts arent a waste, I just need time. And the thing is im fine with waiting. I just dont know if he is being truthful or this is another game of his. The thing is, we tried already ending all contact, and he came back, and we had this great night where he said he loved me and everyting. Then the next day its like that night never happened (oh btw no we didnt have sex that night). So my questions is: DO YOU THINK HE IS FOR REAL? OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER GAME WHERE HE CAN CONTINUE TREATING ME LIKE CRAP?
20090227123921AAIjCsK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I overcome these communication problems with my husband?	My husband and I have been married for 7 years and are trying to work on a reconciliation.  We split 3 months ago due to excessive arguing but are trying to work on it again.  One of the biggest problems we have is he always wants his way and I feel disrespected.  Mostly its stupid things like how to do housework.  If I do it "wrong" he tells me the "right" way to do it.  Most times I gave in just to keep peace but after I got sick of being his robot I stopped doing anything his way at all.  After a year of arguing, we split.       We have been together for 3 weeks again and we both promised to change.  Now, when he talks to me he says things like "I'm not trying to start something but when you fold the towels my way they look better in the cabinet" or "I'm not trying to start something, but this goes on the top shelf in the dishwasher".      I said we should be able to talk without that statement in front and it makes me think he still does not think I am capable of thinking on my own.  It turned into an argument and I left the house crying.      What can I do?
20090307034534AAD5mRA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it true that guys prefer blondes to brunettes?	i was talking to my friend the other day, and she wastelling me how she was once making out with this guy, and after she asked him why so many guys liked her. He replied with "You're blonde, you're female, you have boobs and a good figure, and you can be entertaining. But it's mainly the blonde thing." She was shocked and asked around, every guy agreed. And it's true, she does have a LOTof guys like her - and most of us girls at my school are brunette. I am and i know i NEVER have anyone like me, or at least that i know about.      So is this true???

He says hes "set in his ways" (hes kind of a loner, home body)  and doesnt want to see me as often as I want to see him ( wouldnt mind seeing him, and have him spend the night every day, or every other day). We both have a lot of time on our hands right now, and i guess it bums me out that he rather be all by himself than with me.   Am I too needy?

20090227124432AAulmTp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for father's rights?	Court Holds That Same-Sex Partner Lacks Standing to Seek Child Custody    http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_n...       There's a growing amount of divorce cases involving custody between married female partners, where the mother of the children claim her former partner does not have any rights to the child.  This is very similar to what fathers have fought for over the lat 30+ years.  Even if granted visitation rights, the mother can still violate her former partner's right by simply refusing to obey the orders.  Mothers, for the most part, are never punished in any way for violating these orders.  According to a U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services study, "Survey of Absentee Parents" a minimum of 60% of these orders are violated by the mother.      So, in order to fight for the protection of parental rights for non-custodial women formerly married to women, should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for non-custodial father's rights?
20090505103309AA6NwS8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do men do this on a date?	I went on a date with a guy a few months ago. On our first date and one of the first pieces of information was the following: "You have to be careful  who you go out with these days, too many STD's out there." This came out of his mouth and I played it off by changing the subject. Is not the first time it happens to me. Another guy on another date said something similar: "I am 100% STD free." What is up with that? Do they want to scare their date away?
20090227130405AAtN4VE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a girl. should i make her jealous?	i like a girl that is a strip club waitress(fully clothed). i have been friends with her at her job for 2 months. she likes me and i like her but i recently found out she might get back with her ex. so tonite i was thinking of taking my stripper friend upstairs to the vip room and asking the waitress to get her for me. my friend is a total slut. the waitress knows what the stripper has tried to do with me in the past. she will break every rule in the place. i never touch her out of respect for the waitress. i never even get dances from any of the girls either because i wanted her to think im a good guy. tonight im going to vip with the stripper. im going to touch her and let her do whatever she wants to me. i know it will upset the waitress but she upset me by telling me she went out with her ex. i hear she likes jerks so i think this is a pretty uncool thing to do. should i try and make her jealous or will this backfire?

20090307012539AAHkRd4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUY PROBLEM!! PLEASE HELP!!?	So I got into a huge fight with a guy that I have been dating and we haven't spoken for over a month. And recently I was sitting with my friends in the college lounge and he comes over to us and asks one of my friends a question. We did not talk. But my friends told me that he was looking at me from time to time.       Then this week, he comes to me again and he asks if i still have his papers and I said I did and he said if he could have them back!   Then he left and I went after him saying I am sorry for what happened and he told me he would like to be nothing more than friends. He also said that we either could be friends or if we still were not talking then he would be fine with that          If he wants to be friends or if he says he doesnt mind NOT being my friend, then why is he making an effort to show up randomly in my face like that, TWICE??? I really need an explanation       Thank you so much    Jill

20090307025354AATtZnA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Age 40+ & single or very briefly married?  How come?	I am in my 60's & was married for 2 yrs from age 19-21.  I always figured I'd remarry when I "got my act together" but I never seemed to be able to do it.  I knew something was wrong with me but not what.  Then when I was in my late 40's I discovered that I was bi-polar.  In spite of medications & therapy, I still don't have it together so I decided to do some guy out there a big favor and not marry him.  I'm not exactly easy to get along with since I am so moody.  Even so, it would have been nice to have had a companion throughout my life.  I'm not feeling sorry for myself; it's just the way it is & I've managed to find many things to do which I enjoy.      What is your story?  I'd like to hear it.

20090227123831AAuYT9P	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this normal guy behavior?	This guy and I talked about 4 times on facebook chat.   I started the conversation with him in the beginning because whenever I walked pass him, I would catch him looking at me and he would looks away quickly, so I thought he likes me and I was attractive to him too, and so I decided to start a conversation.       Now, whenever we see each other at school it is really weird.   We don't really look at each other..but we know that we are there.   For example:  I am walking one way.. and he is walking the opposite way towards me we would look at each other far away... but as we start to walk closer and closer.. we drift our eyes the other way.      And today, he was walking to his car.. and I was walking on like the side of him and he just walked pass me and I know that he knew I was there.      Why does he act like we never talked before...   Do other guys do this type of stuff?

I know he loves me too.  He's made it clear that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me.      But, he doesn't want marriage or kids.  And I do.  I don't know if I can really give up my desire for a husband and children.  But I don't know if I can just leave the person that understands me and loves me more than anyone else, the person I would give my life for.      Have you ever had something similar happen in your life?  What did you do?  How did you live with your decision?      I'm so scared of making the wrong decision.

20090307040725AA6oHyu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How far will a player go to act like he cares?	He is 27 although I get the feeling he is a player because the ladies love him, he knows it, and he's always getting drunk on weekends, travels alot, he is extremely good-looking,confident and has a playful personality. Most of our conversations he's always making sexual references and sexual innuendos.      On the other hand he has been pursuing me since october and he can hold a very serious and mature conversation, he's always checking in on me everyday, compliments me on my appearance and personality, says he 'loves me' and wants to be with me forever (only sweet-talk?).       I haven't given in yet because I feel like he's just putting on a sincere act saying and doing absolutely whatever he can to woo me so that I may eventually fall for him and sleep with him.       Last night he said he didn't want the same old jokey conversations anymore, and he wanted me to open up about myself. He told me about his past and he even gave me his address incase I ever wanted to visit him.       Maybe I have trust issues but I dunno... If he is a player he is by far the best act I've seen yet. So do you think he's just using me as his toy or does he really have feelings for me?

20090307040132AALjvop	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP...dating a shy girl... Will she call me back? Ladies pls.?	Hey,       I see this girl in salsa class. My class is beore hers so I see her at the interchange once a week. I asked her out for a first coffee date earlier this week on tuesday. She was v nervous and tense but I think she likes me. At the end of the date she asked me if I was going to be in class this friday and i said yes so she said " oh, so i'll see you this friday then" in a tone like shes asking me to confirm. She left saying "see you soon".       After tuesday I didnt contact her as i will see her on friday ( yesterday ). But she was alte yesterday and after my class i didnt see her so i cycled down the road and crossed the main road. as soon as i crossed i saw her crossing the opposite way just next me on her bike.       So i shouted her name and she was like.."Oh heeeeey" but she was crossing so went to the other side. We both got off our bikes. She was looking at me and the cars going by on the road didnt know what to do for 5 sec. I tried to cross the road to talk to her. But I think she was shy so she ran off (!) and cycled off. I think its really sweet.       Does this mean that she definitely likes me?       Anyway I called her last night and there was no answer so maybe shes was busy. I called her earlier this morning trying to ask her out on a second date and there was no answer. Maybe she was busy again.       So the question is that do you think she will return my calls? Or do I need to keep calling her as she is shy?       Does she like me?       thanks!

20090227130029AAOL1kC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex calls me and texts everyday, he comes to see me..but says he can't be with me?	My ex and I broke up in the beginning of December, he called me on Christmas Day.  Ever since he always texts and calls me everyday.  One time I tried to confront him about it and asked him why we couldn't be together he said because we weren't compatible.  When we dated he never even bothered to come see me at work or meet any of my friends or family.  Last week he came to my job to have lunch with me and met my brother and his wife, and a lot of my friends that are coworkers.  On Saturday I was at a club by his house, and he wouldnt stop texting me all night long, and he insisted I spent the night at his house when I left the club..  I went over there he cuddled with me all night long.  When we were together we had sex, but after we broke up he doesn't even try to, he says he respects me....but yet we sleep in the same bed and its weird that he doesn't try anything....Does he still have feelings for me?? What should I do??
20090307024312AAP2mSe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I only have guy friends..how do I make chick friends?	I'm a flirt and I've always made guy friends by breaking the ice by flirting, then just becoming normal friends.      but when it comes to girls I always get nervous especially if they're pretty [i have low self-esteem] and end up not saying much and becoming boring.      and i've noticed when i'm in a room full of kids by age, i pick out the girls and see who's pretty, then i just study them and pick out one girl and see how i could look like her and dress like her.      i'm a weirdo really.       i'm a girl, 15. what's wrong with me? like whenever a girl approaches me im just so happy to just be next to her i just go empty and not have anything to say, eventually she walks away and i feel so stupid that i just run off to boys and joke around immaturely.

20090306233155AA9Mw6p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it true that men end up with women like thier mothers and women end up with men like their fathers ?	If so I will happily die a bachelor. I will never be brought to heel and have my spirit eroded by such a female. Please tell me it is not so. I would like to hear from husbands and wives on here. My father is a passive and kind man with an evil vindictive woman. I can see such from far range in give them wide berth avoiding them to the last. I have been burnt when I was younger but am a smart enough guy now. I will always hate her and any women like her that come near me liking me. I see the effect of such when I look at my father. He is old and will die soon. When he does she will be alone and feel the cold of not having he or family for we all hate her. I will never see her when he dies he is the only parent I loved . I hate her. I don't owe her for having me. She brought a child into the world and tried to destroy them and break the spirit always ( me ) she never sided with me against enemies. She has and always will be an unfit mother. I had to build myself . Please I want to hear from those who met the opposite of a nasty parent.

20090307034800AAvuZ4j	Family & Relationships;Family	I am so tired of my unappreciative sister taking advantage of my dad?	My sister is 21 years old, has never went to college, and works at Subway. She still lives at home, paying for absolutely nothing, and constantly talks **** about my dad. She always talks about how he's such a horrible father and wants him dead. What bothers me is that as my sister was saying this, she was sitting in his house eating the food  he pays for. I admit, my dad isn't exactly the best father, but no one deserves that from their own daughter, especially when they're doing so much for them. My sister really does not think my dad does anything for her, how could she be so clueless? I honestly hate living with her and I don't know what to do anymore. Because of my situation right now, I cannot move out, I am only 17 anyways, and shouldn't have to because I appreciate everything my dad does for me, and he has to do these things by law. He doesn't have to help her at all. I just wanted some advice on what I should do about my ***** of a sister?

This teacher just happens to be pretty dang attractive, late 20's or early 30's. I'm obviously really in to him but I know a relationship would never happen between us...or would it? Whenever I see this teacher in the hallways, he just stares at me and smiles. It seems like he is always around me... He's made several obvious attempts to talk to me out of the blue. How can I tell if he is in to me? Obviously he would never flirt with me in school...but should I try to flirt with him? Would it be too risky?

20090307043736AAFRL1V	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like beating her *** to a pulp, but i can't do that, what should I do ?	OK I have just moved back home from Chicago and couldn't find and apartment for me and my dogs before I moved back so I was living with my dad and brother until I could find a place. I am 24 years old and haven't lived at home since I was 16. So things weren't the greatest there. my brother also has a very bad anger problem, that he has had all his life and is hard to control. So him and I got in a fight for stupid stuff, well we hit each other and then he ran outside and busted in my car window to my BRAND new car. I was pissed and took my things and my dogs and went to my friends house. We sat for a while deciding if  I should call the police. My brother called later and told me he would pay for my car, just don't turn him in to the police. So SHE convinced me it was a good idea to call and make a report but say it was broken into over night and I found it that way when I woke up so I could get my insurance to pay for it & just have my brother pay the deductable. I also wasn't completely convinced I would see any money from him, and I didn't have it to pay out of pocket. Well to sum it up, my deductable was $400 which Is WAY more then what it would cost to just go to the junk yard and get a glass and have my dad put it in. So i cancelled my insurance claim and my brother bought me a window. Through all of this I was staying with that girl, just to get away from my family. I only stayed with her about 2 1/2 weeks. In that time period one of her windows broke and she said I did it, when I didn't and told me I owed her $400 to get it fixed. WOW , I didn't even break the window and it was in HER room on the other side of the house. So I told her I am NOT giving her any money to fix that. NOW HERES WHERE IM PISSED!!!! She called the county police dept. and tried to turn me in for a false police report and insurance fraud. OMG... I have NOTHING on my record and she is just being trif. cause thats the way she is. I am soooo mad that I want to beat her face in and anyone who knows me knows i am not a violent person... except for my brother sister fights..lol, but I am not confertational at all, and my blood is boiling right now. I went to the police station and they said they know her and know her record and know she is crazy and I am fine, but I can't help but to still be sooo ******* pissed that i want to know how somone like her sleeeps at night... What would you do ??

20090227125247AArXIvK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I Confront Her Or?	Okay here is the drill:    Person (A) is this co-worker of mine, also got me the job where I work, and we're pretty good friends. She says she's my BEST FRIEND.     Person (B) is a good friend of mine that I met through my Girlfriend/Roommate who will be referred as person (1). Person (B) And I have a really strong bond and friendship, and we're practically musical and mental soul mates. But Person (B) uses me for rides to his house, and other places, and only calls usually when he needs this. So the link between us has dwindled.   Lately Person (A)'s boyfriend has been subject to Person (B)'s lust. Person (B) is gay. And This has started conflict and turmoil between Person A, B, me, and the boyfriend. Because Person (b) told me he hooked up with the boyfriend, and told me not to tell person (A), but I thought it was to much of a secret not to tell her so I told her. Person (B) and I talked it over and we were fine about me telling her in order for it to not become a huge gap in all of our friendships. Person (A) confronted her boyfriend, boyfriend says its a lie. and I gave up on the drama after that. I'm not going to play the who is lying who isn't lying game.   But now Person (A) is calling Person (B) and telling him I am talking behind his back. Person (B) sent me a text message telling me I"m "a dyke with no balls who thinks she's hot but she's not so F-U!"   And when I asked Person (A) she said she had no idea what person (B) meant. Then I talked to person (B) after he apologized and he told me person (A) told him I was talking behind his back.   I try to keep a No drama policy...but it's not always working. I'm letting all of this go, but should I confront person (A) before she causes more turmoil between all of our friendships???   help!

20090227130156AAsIFCe	Family & Relationships;Friends	Told a secret and wish I hadn't.....?	I'm a parent at our school and one of my best friend's told me a secret last night about another parent.  It wasn't anything about her personal life, but was about an incident between this person and the teachers.  The parent it is about is very loud and generally mouths off about all her business to any one that will listen.  Anyway, today at pick-up I was chatting in the car to another parent who is a friend but in a different year to the parent who the secret was about.  Without thinking we were chatting, and I told her the gist of the secret.  She doesn't personally know the parent it was about but knows who she is.  Now I am worried that my best friend who told me the secret may find out that I told this other parent, as of course, she may well tell other people.  One of the people she may tell, knows my best friend to chat to, and I'm now worried she may inadvertently mention it to my best friend, who will then think 'how does she know'?!      Do I let sleeping dogs lie, or do I confess to my friend that I let what she told me 'slip'.   Or am I over-reacting over playground gossip?!

20090227125001AAOpmDt	Family & Relationships;Family	HELP! I have a question about my son spending the night at my boyfriends...?	I am 31 years old and divorced. My son is 11 years old and my b/f is 35.  I have weekend custody of my son and spend the weekends either at my boyfriends (I live on college campus and do not want to take him to my house there) or my fathers, depending on the weekend.        My question is this. When my son stays over at my b/f's house, being that there are only two bedrooms and a couch. Who should sleep where and why? My boyfriend likes to sleep in his own bed, I sleep on the couch and I give my son the spare bedroom.  Should I sleep in the bed and he on the couch? or should my b/f go on the couch and kid gets bedroom? or should I take couch and they take beds?       Please explain your answer for 10 pts. :) Thank you so much for your help.

There's 4 people on one table with one person in between us, so we're not bunched up together. well lately i've started to befriend the girl next to me, and now the other girl is starting to be really mean. she glares at me, she sort of criticises me and she acts really pushy like being sarcastic at times when it's hurtful or unnecessary. she's really starting to be a bother because i feel she's jealous, even if she isn't. It could also be because i'm quite good at english and i got the highest level in the class, she might be jealous because of that. I don't know, she's just been acting really cold towards me. if any of you have any ideas as what this might be, please type them below. thank you, you guys will help a lot.   (p.s, i'm only in year seven and i don't think telling a teacher would be necessary, but if you must, type it down.)

20090307013459AAgrsFf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls only!dilemma with dating...any advice?	hm ok i am a 22 year old college students.its kinda weird because i never ever had a girlfriend in my life (and still a virgin...lame i know...) just because i dont think i can commit into a real relationship.so i have being avoiding a lo of girls.the main thing is that i sometimes feel really really lonely around here this place i moved 4 years ago from europe.its kinda depressing...couple of my frineds told me i should date a girls or something similar. i was thinking about asking a girl out in the past but i am so freekin shy.however, most girls that i observe in my college or in general look so f@kin lame and pathetic (even though they are really cute...) in means that they look so fake and pretend to be the hot-club-alcoholic chicks .these are one of the reasons that i dont like asking girls because i dont want to waste my time with " another hot chick"...i dont know, but at the same time it sucks to be alone...so i all i wanted to ask is a couple of advice...
20090307013239AAHkBAl	Family & Relationships;Friends	I can't get her to cut it out.?	I've had this friend since 7th grade. She's nice but sometimes she can be real bit***. She literally calls herself a bit**. I noticed alot of times she can be very rude and somewhat of a killjoy. For example, if my friends and I crack jokes and she doesn't get it she says "You guys are stupid. That wasn't even funny. What retard makes a joke like that?" or if I make a mistake she's puts me down like "WOW, you're an idiot if you didn't know that." No one ever really points it out but a lot of times she likes to lie like "Oh yeah, I used to go to school with nick jonas when we were little. He was so weird and ugly back then, but we used to talk alot" and she goes on about all the stars and singers she knows and talks to all the time. None of us really confront her though because she blows things out of proportion. A lot of my other friends talk about it, but none of us want to tell her face to face because she's very rude when it comes to things like that. She'll hit too...(she socked me so hard once i had the bruise for a week and a half)      What I'm asking is how I can tell her without making her say such rude, hurtful comments. Also, she has friends but a majority don't hang out with her because of the issues above. I have a boyfriend that I enjoy spending alone time with because I don't see him often but she always wants me to be with her. If I tell her I'm leaving she literally holds me down until it's time to go to class so i can't see him. If I DO manage to go, when I see her in class she puts me down even more with things like "It's not right that you're always ditching me. You're the worst friend, etc..." Sometimes I really can't stand it but I don't know what to do. Help?

And My uncle had come to our clinic saying he had problems breathing a year ago, but my dad just didn't follow up he forgot or something...I don't know, now one year later, he had a mild heart attack, then got admitted to hospital and passed away 3 days late once he heard he had 3 blocks in his heart, he panicked at the news and died once all visitors left (his family-his wife my dad) , he panicked thinking of the heart bypass surgery  and had a massive heart attack- died. ANd the Stupid hospital didn't let visitor in over night, and he's not used to being alone. So there was no one to keep talking to him and reassuring him..My father blames himself for not taking action earlier, my dad and my uncle are like good friends..So my dad is soo upset, and loosing weight not eating, and always talking about his mistake and philosophizing..My mum And i are very worried.WHat to do

We stay together over night even and got along without hardly ever fighting, but then there's the sad part. I left to go to college in another state, 3000 miles away. We tried to stay in touch but things fell through and I realized that i fell in love with her. So i came back home, and she had met someone and now has boyfriend. He won't let her talk to me and it's hard to not be able to do anything. I realized how much i cared for this girl and now can't do anything without looking the "bad guy" ex.

20090307010340AA0zMZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ugh....What do I do here... I feel like a helpless wus!!?	Hello all. I have been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 yrs now. She is still in a heated battle with her ex(husband) over custody issues, money etc. I have been there for her from day 1 helping her with everything from moving out to buying a car, to being a role model for her 2.5 yr old son, etc. I have spent countless amounts of money as well because I know she is hurting financially. She has been going through a rough time with holidays, with lawyers fighting over silly stuff, she has a custoday evaluation going on, and now she just found out her ex is having another kid with his new girlfriend. She bugged out this past weekend because she found out and she went to go see her sister. I was confused because I ALWAYS talk about EVERYTHING with her. I didnt understand why she shut me out, and it sparked a jealousy rage inside of me. I thought that because she was so upset that she was going to go out and do whatever at here sisters place since she has a male roomate. I am not sure how I became insecure, but I got real jealous after she said that she was going to get wasted. We are both in our late 20's and I should have acted more maturely I know that. Well I did not leave her alone all weekend, when she asked for space. She was real real angry at me. She came home and I still didnt give her space, I stopped over with food for her, and called her etc, when all she wanted was space. She became furious after I didnt let her be and she said that it was over. I feel like a jerk now, and I need to get her back. I acted like a child and got jealous for no reason. I tried to give her space all week, but I ended stopping over her place on wednesday with flowers and a card, this made her more mad. Tonight we went to a concert and she wouldnt kis me or hold my hand. We had a great time but it was weird. She has not removed my pictures from her wall, or given me my stuff back from her place, or ask for her stuff. We have a joint cell phone acount (she also has another phone) and she hasnt given it back or asked me to canel it.She said that she has so much going on with the evaluation, lawyers, and just findinig out that her ex was having a child to worry about our relationship. We were a HUGE part of eachothers life until this happened. I dont ask her for much just some affection everyonce and a while. Not sure what to do here. She says that she is real mad about me checking up on her and not giving her space this weekend. To break up with me though is a bit much I think. Have I just not given her enough time to not be mad? DO I need to give her a certain amount of space? She said tonight that she appreciated me fighting so hard for her that she was upset at me still, and I wouldnt give her space. Help here please, I care for her a lot and I would like to get her back. My family loves her, I love her son, I love her family, etc. Is she confused? not thinking clearly? Help!!   57 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   I just do not get how she goes from calling me "baby" and "I love you" holding my hand, etc, to not wanting to touch me at the concert. We had a pec on the lips for one second thats it. I am Very confused, is this all from her stress?? Why doesnt she just boot me out of her life for good? I mean pictures all over her place of me still, has her cellphone still, has not asked for her belongings...I dont get it. When I talk to her about it and ask her for another chance she says that she does not want anymore drama right now and I am causing drama, and gets upset and doesnt want to talk about it and says how stressed she is.   42 minutes ago      Thank you ladies for your response!!!    I just do not get why women need "space" from guys they love.    She does not have anyone around but me, her sis is 3.5 hrs away, and her friends were all lost during the divorce,(thats still going on). I am all she has, and she has pushed me away, I dont get it, was I that much of a problem? As you can see I am clearly in love with her, we just enjoyed a wonderful Valentines day a couple weeks ago. I have to worry about myself, but at what point does she realize what she is missing??   32 minutes ago      I am sorry. the more I think about things the more stuff comes to my head. how come she all the sudden is talking to her sister A LOT about all of the things she is going through? I was there 24/7 for her and I knew way more than anyone but now it seems like she all the sudden turned to her sister? I am not jealous just wondering why she is confiding in her sis instead of me now??   9 minutes ago

I am looking to file for divorce in MI.  I have talked to several lawyers who want $1500-$2500 for an uncontested divorce with no children.  This seems like so much to me.  I have been looking on line at the sites that will type and send you the forms you fill out on line and sites that say you can buy the "kit" of paperwork needed to file yourself.  I was wondering if anyone has used thes sites and do they really do what they promise.  I have seen prices with these from $45-$300.  This sounds so much more doable to me.  Can anyone give me direction on a site that may be legitimate?
20090307023250AAWhd5Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help please. im really upset?	me & my best friend have fallen out. He has fell out with me. Ill explain the story.. He always annoys me and like punches me and stuff.. prods me and just gets on my nerves & I said to him.. one day you'll get what you deserve. and he was like who off your brother? & I said no. I have someone in mind. No wonder James hit you(james is someone he called then he hit him because of it) i told him he provokes people. then he kept scraping scissors on my floor so i shouted stop! and he pored drink over me then left my house and id tried explaining and he told me to delete his number.      He has ither fell out with me because he was pi**ed off with me. Or maybe because me saying 'i have someone in mind' could of seemed like a threat.       I didn't mean it as a threat. What I meant was I had someone in mind who had previously done it (james). I didn't mean I was gonna get someone TO give him what he deserves.       But he may not see it that way. I'm so upset.

20090227130518AAMnTuc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it bad to demote my maid of honor or make my other bridesmaid co maid of honor?	I asked my best friend to be my maid of honor, of course she said yes. That was about a year ago, throughout the course of a few months she didn't seem excited at all so I confronted her on it. She said we still had time since the wedding was a year away and she didn't think she needed to be worrying about stuff yet. I understand that, so it was supposably a misunderstanding. Well my wedding is about 5 months away and she still doesn't seem excited - or if she does, it seems to be a fake excited. I think she overexaggerates how excited she is - she hasn't even gotten her dress yet and I have said as long as it's my color for the wedding she can get whatever she wants. She also hasn't planned anything or helped out with anything besides the photographer which took her months of me asking her to get it finally done. My other bridesmaid is clearly excited about the wedding and there's no doubt in my mind she would love to be the maid of honor and would probably do a better job at it. I know my moh now well enough to be sure she would flip out, be very angry, not understand, put me on a guilt trip, and possibly end our friendship. But in the same time, it's my wedding and I should be able to have the person who I want and feel will do the best job as my maid of honor. Do I tell her how I feel and demote her or make my other bridesmaid co-maid of honor? I feel bad to demote her because when I asked her I knew what I was doing, but our friendship seems to be changing and I'm not sure. Help please!
20090227124003AAOyh8a	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell the "other woman's" Husband she has been cheating on him?	I have been married for over 5 years and recently found out that my husband has been unfaithful.  I found out and confronted my husband and he came clean and this other woman is a co-worker and I do not know her but I DO know that she is also married and I confronted her over the phone and she lied about everything after my husband came clean.  So now I am stuck the question if I should tell her husband what she has been doing with my husband...      Half of me wants to-I am feeling like she is getting off the hook.  The other half would not want to just because I would not want to hurt somebody or have them feel like I feel.        Please ANY advise!!

20090227130314AAIN3G8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you keep your life exciting?	I am 31 years old and have been married for about 5 years. Before I got married I was about 50 pounds over weight, had no clue how to talk to women, and was a little socially boring. Fast forward 5 years and now I have been working out and down to about 8% body fat, being married has taught me how to speak to women, and I do something exciting once a month (concert, sky dive, travel...). Something new I was going to try was living a double life every couple weeks. You know like a spy. My plan was to drive go to the opposite side of town to some bars/clubs and act like I was meeting some friends there. Talk to some new people and give them my fake name, email, phone number. Next I would make out with one of my new friends and never see her again. I would not do this too many times. You know that way it stays exciting. So how do you guys keep your life exciting?

20081103104530AA7pwz9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At what point do you ask where a relationship is going? ?	I'm currently talking to a guy online. We've been talking for about a month now, and when I first started talking to him I said that I was looking for someone special to have serious relationship with. He said the same. However, the topic of discussion on his part is always about sex. Nothing disgusting, just random questions. We say how much we miss each other and we talk a lot online, but he doesn't want to give out his number yet.       The problem is that I want to ask him where he sees this relationship going but I don't want to scare him away. I feel like I'm wasting my time talking to someone who may be interested more in my body than pursuing a relationship. I'm a 19 year old virgin and want to remain one til I'm married. He's in his late 20's and probably does not want to wait...He really is a nice guy, but I'm just not sure what his intentions are. When should I ask him?      Thanks in advance for your help!

20081027115239AA7rnwM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i being manipulated into having sex?	Been very close friends with this guy for 7 years, we have been intimate in phases when neither of us were in a relationship, maybe 25 times over the years but have spent way more time as best buddies – no sex.  The last time was over 6 months ago. The trouble is that I no longer want to be intimate with him though he still wants to. He can’t understand why I don’t want to anymore and I don’t want to tell him it’s because it’s boring and no longer satisfying. Plus I have to put in so much effort with him, it’s really takes a lot out of me and I don’t get the same effort/pleasure back. He keeps pestering me and I just say I really don’t want anyone right now. At first, he tried to guilt me into it but that didn’t work, then he tried to bribe me (offered to be my sugar daddy since he knows I’m cash strapped right now) I still said no. Now I feel like I’m being punished. He says we can be friends but only over the phone not in person anymore – he says he can’t handle being in my presence as I turn him on and won’t give him none and since he’s been with me before, it’s hard for him to have me around.  But we’ve hung out so many times in the past (no sex) and it’s never been an issue until now.   I feel like I’m being subtly manipulated. I miss my friend but I don’t want to have to sleep with him in order to hang out with him. He says I should be more understanding of his position. Am I being unfair or is he?

Olá pessoal, tenho 15 anos, quando eu era menor tinha uma menina que dizia que gostava de mim, ela tem 14 anos, mora numa cidade próxima. Eu n?o gostava dela... Mas no sábado passado, eu vi ela no orkut, aí adicionei e entrei em contato. No mesmo sábado, por ironia do destino, eu saí com meus pais para a cidade dela, e ela estava lá... Eu n?o esque?o dela olhar pra mim sorrindo.. a partir daí, eu acho qualquer outra menina sem gra?a, fico o dia inteiro no computador só esperando ela responder meus recados no orkut ou entrar no msn. Uma tristeza tomou conta de mim. Eu penso nela a cada instante. Um simples recadinho dela me faz pular de alegria. Eu tenho o celular dela, orkut e msn. O QUE EU FA?O?? ME AJUDEM!!!

20081126104743AAL0guH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex who I love wants to hook up but was saying he missed me too?	Ok so my ex and i broke up 3 months ago. We were together 3 years and lived together and had a son together who is 15 months. I've never stopped loving him and we've had our fair share of rocky times. Never been apart this long and this was supposed to be final but he tried for the second time (1st time was 2wks ago) to have sex with me last night. Only this time he told our son "Daddy loves Mommy" and when I didn't catch it he made sure I knew what he said. He also told me he missed me (referring to me seperately to the sex with me) and tried calling me honey when asking a question. He wasn't trying in a horny way but being very loving but I stayed strong and said no although i did kiss him back a couple times. At the end of the night he was asking me when i would call him and asking me to stay the night or let him come stay with me and our son. He made plans to take our son and I shopping Friday making sure to not allow his sister (a best friend of mine) to come so it could just be us. I thought it was just sex the first time he tried but the things he said and did this time made me start thinking maybe he really does miss me and maybe we could work things out. But today after I had to deny him several times via text he did respond that he wants to have sex way more than just once and doesn't want to use me. But the way the text sounded it seems like he does just want only sex cause I told him I can't because I miss him not just the sex and he didn't ever really mention us in his reply. I'm just trying to figure this out. I love him and am having the hardest time of my life being a single mother with no friends and family near me but I don't want to be used for sex. I know I need to get over him and move on but I just really would like to know what he's thinking and why he would say this stuff just for sex. Any thoughts or opinions?? Just sex, confused and horny, wants sex and maybe more?? 
20090306165429AAbDy8p	Family & Relationships;Friends	I don't know what to do, should i even bother to begin with?	My guy friend was really nice and sweet to me and he acted like he truly cared about me.   Well he’s been treating me like crap. He want talk to me and he acts like he doesn’t care. I always have to talk to him first. I confronted him about it last weekend, but it was through text cause neither one of us have time to talk a lot in person cause we don’t have any classes together.       He’s the main part of the conversation:   Me: Whats happened between us?   Him: What do you mean   Me: oh don’t play dumb. You know what im talking about we hardly talk anymore, things are different now and I don’t like it at all   Him: well don’t look at me   Me: your part of this situation and its like you don’t give a crap about me but you probably never did to begin with   Him: don’t even say that   Me: well that’s how it seems and how it feels   Him: sorry   Me: whatever you don’t care   Him: yeah I do but its not like you talk to me and when you do you always get mad at me so idk what im suppose to do. Keep talking and keep making you mad   Me: its just like I always have to talk to you first. Its like you don’t care if I talk to you or not. And like you don’t care cause you act like you don’t if you actually acted like you cared for once I wouldn’t get mad but you don’t so I get mad.   Him: Sorry   Me: when are you not sorry? All I hear us sorry sorry sorry. Act sorry for once.      He didn’t text me back.      Part of me doesn’t want to loose him but another part of me is tired of all this crap.   At school when I see him he stares at me like he’s sorry but he want talk to me. It’s been a week since that conversation and I don’t know what to do..

20090306170742AAnCtsV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend/boy problems. (Long Story Short) Suggestions please?	Okay. So here's my current situation.    (Names were changed...)      Jacoby:   I dated Jacoby for 3 months. He dumped me for a 16 year old who lives an hour away. When that didn't last, he decided he had made a mistake with me. It really hurt me...but I decided to give him a second chance. This time, we dated for almost 1 month, and he did the same thing again, but he doesn't want a second chance, and I am NOT willing to give one to him...Only this time, he is moving. Soon. He's my best friend, even though he has done these things to me, and I simply can't seem to get over him. (Yeah, it's confusing. I refuse to let myself date him again, but I really do still like him)  I've been through a lot more in the last months other than just boy problems, so part of the break-ups are probably my fault. But Jacoby told me that the only reason he dumped me was because he is moving at the end of the school year. I believed him... But at the same time, he told my best friend that it was because I was too clingy, and that I made him do many things that I did not make him do. Such as listen to certain music, sit with certain people, and do certain things. I do admit to making him stop cussing, because I find that completely unattractive, and he said he was 100% okay with that.      Kaiden:   Kaiden is my best friend. We've been dating since yesterday, and I talked to him a lot through all the Jacoby crap. He means a lot to me, and I like him...      But. As I am dating Kaiden, I really miss Jacoby. He still is one of my best friends, but he is just being a total jerk about everything. I don't feel right dating Kaiden while I still have feelings for Jacoby. (I'm not even allowed to date Jacoby again, so friendship is the ONLY thing possible now.) Jacboy has never been right for me, but I really can't seem to let him go.      I don't want to hurt Kaiden, but I also don't know what to do.      I care about both of them so much, but the whole, dating Kaiden thing doesn't work out when I miss Jacoby so much. Most of all, I want Jacoby and I to be good friends, and I want him to leave on a good note when he has to.      Kaiden won't date me again if I break up with him, and Jacboy is going to be gone soon anyway. I just...don't know what the right thing to do is.      Any suggestions?   Help would be appreciated.   I'm pretty much waling around with my head cut off.   Always.   Emily?

She was pretty cute, same age as me. I go to an all-guy school, she goes to an all-girl school. After talking about random stuff for 25 mintues, we went to my friends house to swim and talk for about 2 hours. I never really had the chance to talk one on one with her, but I wanted to. I want to get to know her more, but I don't know how. Like that'd be weird for her if I randomly ask her to go out to a movie or something sometime. She didn't really talk much at all the whole time.      I know for a fact she is single.. how should I ask her out? Should I send her a message on facebook? Should I text her? Where could we go to get to know each other better? Besides a dinner, that's an obvious one, but what are other good places to go? Movie? (WE'RE BOTH 16)

20081017104347AAffoJB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong to think there's an intimate relationship between my BF and his 20 year old daughter?	I hate to even ask because I know this will get me a lot of negative comments but please read and give me mature honest opinions....   My boyfriend has a 20 year old daughter that he started caring for about 2 years ago since her mothers death.  Prior to that he only met her one (for reasons unknown).       Anyway, I understand her need for him and his need to "make up for lost times" and all.  However, they are extremely affectionate with one another.  I mean every time she leaves or comes home they kiss (in the mouth mostly) and hug and touch.  He lives in a 1 bedroom and they sleep together.  No matter what time of day or night I come over, there's no evidence of someone sleeping on the couch or floor.  Almost always, when she's home he will not answer my calls or call me.  She moved out on her own about 2 months ago, within 5 miles of him, but seriously, every single night either she spends a night with him or him with her.  When I hear from him, I automatically know she's not around.       He also gets really furious, like a jealous rage,  when she even mentions dating.  At night when he prepares for bed, he wears pajama pants but nothing underneath which leaves his man hood dangling.  I'm worried about that because she's in his presence and that's inappropriate.  I'm not insecure or paranoid...TRUST ME.  This is really happening but I can't prove anything other than what I've seen.  I'm wondering if being around her reminds him alot of her mother and maybe he's attracted to her in a way he shouldn't be.  I know it sounds weird but to see the way he touches her and how he despise her dating and how he walks around indecent in front of her, them sleeping together at her age when she has her own place is making me very suspicious.        When he and I took a vacation, she called every hour and sometimes in the middle of the night.  I know it's her because I know her voice and he would dismiss himself from the hotel room and stay outside talking with her for more than an hour or two.        Again, I understand love and affection amongst parents and offsprings however the affection, touching, jealousy and so forth that I see is truly behond that.       I love him and don't want to leave him based on suspicions but what can I do?

She acts like a guy and thinks she is cool, making fun of others and stuff, but everyone, including me, thinks she is weird.  One of the losers at the school. I'll just call her Anna for this question.      "Anna" invited me to walk with her to the new pizza place nearby after school on Friday. I told her I have to ask my parents.

I have no plans for Friday, so I don't know what excuse I can use to get out of this. Please help!

20090306170024AAVjMJm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Betrayed by best friends :( what do i do?	ok this is a long story im sorry.      so a few months ago a guy added me on myspace who lives in the next town over and we got to talking very frequently. we got along great and actually have been planning to meet lately. i was embarrassed to be talking to guys i didn't know online so i didn't tell anyone at first and eventually told one friend. well call her Maya.  she SWORE she wouldnt tell anyone and constantly encouraged me to talk to and meet up with this guy.      So now me and my best friend of 9 years (who is also friends with Maya) are fighting over jsut a small thing. Maya was at work and i wanted to know if the other friend, well call her Jane, had been talking about me. i felt really guilty but i signed into Maya's facebook just to check if she'd said anything to her.      upon doing so, i discovered that Maya had told leslie alll about my myspace relationship in a message! whatsmore, leslie had signed into my myspace and read all of our conversations and they were making fun of me! and criticizing me and saying they hoped he was a 50 year old rapist. and so now Leslie is soo mad won't even talk to me (although i cant tell her that i know she knows about my myspace relationship) because i didnt tell her,  but i only didn't because i knew she'd judge me and get mad at me.      these are my two best, and pretty much only friends.  it hurts me so bad that they're doing this to me and that maya is being very two faced, telling me shes not taking sides in our little sklirmish while actually telling lesie my deepest secrets. i have a terrible feeling in my stomach and feel terrible. i know i can be blamed for part of this, but i had trusted maya to keep this very personal secret. how do i react, i cant tell them i know, so should i  just act like nothing happened? i don't know if i can do it. and i'm feeling really deppressed and can't get out of it.      help!
