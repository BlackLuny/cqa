We both knew we liked each other && we kissed && all that jazz. haha. lol.   Well, jokingly, I said "you have nice boobs!" haha   He then jokingly said "thanks. you too!"   I didn't feel weird or anything. He only said that, because I said it to him.   YET, as he was saying that, he lightly patted the top of my right boob. He barely even touched it.   I don't think he was being sexually agressive or anything. I think he was just playing around.   What do you think? I should have confronted him, right?

20080621052731AAoAbpF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A lire lentement ............. en silence!?	Salut, lis le s'il te pla?t et ne le jette pas       Lis et tu verras .... et tu sauras ce que tout le monde ressens ...       Il y a au moins 5 personnes dans ce monde qui t'aiment   au point de mourir pour toi.   Il y a au moins 15 personnes qui t'aiment d'une certaine manière..       La seule raison pour laquelle une personne te déteste,   c'est parce qu'elle veut être comme toi.   Un sourire de toi apporte de la joie ?  quelqu'un   même s'il ne t'aime pas.       Toutes les nuits, quelqu'un(e) pense ?  toi avant d'aller se coucher.   Tu représentes le monde pour quelqu'un(e).   Si ce n'était pas pour toi, quelqu'un(e) ne pourrait pas vivre..   Tu es Spécial et Unique et quelqu'un   dont tu ignores l'existence et qui t'aime.       Quand tu fais la plus grosse bêtise,   quelque chose de bien provient de celle-ci.   Quand tu penses que le monde te tourne le dos, regarde bien:   C'est surtout toi qui tourne le dos au monde!!!!       Quand tu penses que tu n'as pas de chance   quand tu n'as pas ce que tu veux, tu ne l'auras probablement pas..   Si tu crois en toi, probablement, t?t ou tard, tu l'auras.   Souviens-toi toujours des compliments que tu re?ois.   Oublie les remarques méchantes.       Dis toujours aux gens ce que tu ressens ?  propos d'eux,   tu te sentiras mieux quand ils le sauront.   Personne ne mérite tes larmes et tes pleurs,   et celui qui le mérite vraiment ne te fera jamais pleurer.       Si tu as un(e) meilleur(e) ami(e), prends le temps de lui dire   ce qu'il représente pour toi.       Envoies cette lettre ?  tous les gens que tu apprécies,   incluant la personne qui te l'a envoyée.       Si tu le fais, tu illumineras le jour de quelqu'un et peut-être   changeras-tu sa perspective de la vie, pour le meilleur.       On dit que cela prend qu'une minute pour remarquer   une personne spéciale, une heure pour l'apprécier,   un jour pour l'aimer, mais qu'on a ensuite besoin de   toute une vie pour oublier.       Envoie cette pensée aux personnes que tu n'oublieras jamais.   C'est un petit message qui leur permettra de savoir   que jamais tu ne les oublieras.   Si tu ne le renvoies pas ou ne l'envoies ?  personne cela signifie   que tu es bien pressé(e) et que tu as oublié tes amis(es).   Arrête-toi un peu et prends le temps de vivre !   Alors ? Qu'est ce que tu attends?   Envoie-le ?  toutes ces personnes qui sont si importantes dans ta vie..          Ce soir ?  minuit ton vrai amour va réaliser qu'il t'aime.

20080608174209AAQ7oXX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Truely amazing?	Often time I am sure alot of you see the common question some what along the lines of "I really like him/her, but they have a bf/gf, how can I get them to go out with me?".       I find it rather interesting that so many people have become so desperate in looking for someone, that it no longer bothers the vast majority that in order for you to achieve happyness, you are willing to sacrifice someone elses happyness. I mean dont you realize that these types of relationships seldomly work out?       When they do they are followed by long drawn out drama and suffering by the person who was left, and whether you choose to accept it or not the person doing the leaving. What you dont think that they still have feelings for the other person? Sadly you are mistaken.       Plus you have to take into account that if they were willing to leave there love for you, what is to stop them from leaving you for someone else? Karma exists whether you believe in it or not, food for thought ;P

20080707171809AA3qYUJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do people have to be so rude and mean?	ok, ive posted some questions on here and also done my share of answering. But one thing that ive noticed is some ppl are so mean or rude when they answer a question! i just answered a question bout suicide, and theres a bunch of ignorant rude answers on there. such as "yea its fun, go eat the candy outta the medicine cabinent." I mean some of these people on here really have no one that they can talk to, so why mak ethem feel really bad and even worse than they already do?! I mean one answer on here can change someones mind about doing something harmful to themselves. Yea some answers on here are stupid or watever but it still dnt matter...but seriously, if you answered a question like that with some rude/mean answer, and then they ended up hurting themselves, how would you feel??! i would feel pretty crappy.    so all im asking and saying, is that if its a serious question dont answer unless ur going to answer with sumn helpful. cuz some could hurt themselves or w/e cuz of u.

20080709100742AAyWR4a	Family & Relationships;Friends	Turning gay HELP?	I'm president of the republican club at school, leader of my church's youth group and president of my school's student government. I've always been against homosexuality, I even tried to get the gay/lesbian club banned from campus, but was blocked by the rest of student government. Lately though I've been having strange feelings.      I was watching tmz the other night and Kim Kardashian came on, and for some reason her body really excited me. Since then I've been noticing all the girls at school a different way, noticing how sexy and attractive they are. I find myself zoneing out and looking at their chest or butts.      Now the president of the gay/lesbian club is running against me for president next school year. I'm getting really nervous around her because she is so pretty, and i've been having day dreams about making out with her. I want to be president next year still, but I don't know where these feelings are coming from.    what do I do?      pm me @ briebire

20080712145109AAcvhYE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl on Top: having trouble making love to my man?	I lost my virginity to my bf a few months ago. The sex is good, but there's just a concern I have. We did missionary & doggy, but Im having trouble doing it on top of him. I REALLY wanna do it on top, but everytime we try, either he slips out or Im not comfortable in the way I move. He doesnt even gimme 1 minute to get into it, he changes position right away. This makes me feel like I fail to please him. I tell him this and he says I do please him, but I'm still new to this and that I need time to get comfortable with it. But Im still worried he's gonna get bored if we always do the same thing. Im new to sex and I wanna explore it with him but it seems like he's just set on his own ways. GIRLS, do you also have this problem? GUYS, would you consider this a problem if your girl couldn't do it on top of you? He's 27, I'm 22, he's had other sexual partners before me of course....I just don't want to seem like a naive girl who knows nothing...:( Also, I've never orgasmed with him. Advice?

Back then, I could just be my old goofy self. I am a playful person and she is too. I just can't be myself around her.       How can I start to be myself rather than hold it in?      What can I talk about when I am around her?(I always go blank)      We were UN-seperable.      I want to be more funner? How can I do that. Right about now, I just need somebody to talk to, like, I have like no friends anymore. I am tired of sitting in the house in the summer, when I can be hanging out with  some of my old friends. Drama came between us. I want it to be ack to normal.      _Thanks.

20081009010532AASBKmD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does every guy want my sister and not me?	Everyone says I'm prettier than her and I kinda think so too but I have only had one guy ask me out(when i was 16) and she has had tons. I guess it's because I'm quiet and down to earth and plain. I'm naturally beautiful so I don't wear much make-up but she doesn't either. But she called me the other day and was telling me about the latest guy wanting to date her and then said, "He's not good enough for me anyway."  Why do guys chase after her then? She's not interested and probably won't get married until she's 40 when she finally settles for someone who is okay.      So why is this? I don't understand.

I have a huge crush on a guy, we dated twice, then he said he doesn't want nothing serious at the moment, just 4 months ago he broke up with his 2 year gf.      So he just wants uncommitted fun, and I told him, I want him for real, so he said, maybe after a few months and our trips (he is going for a month to miami with a friend and I have to work in new york) we could give it another try.      So, should I believe him, wait for him (for about 5 months, give him time, thought it hurts me not having him by my side) or just get him out of my head and heart?      Thanks!

20081013143104AALXite	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to get an annulment. Need help?	I was married two weeks ago, and leading up to the wedding, I had a niggling suspicion that my partner was hiding things from me. I decided that perhaps I was just getting pre wedding jitters and I went through with the Wedding. A day after we were married I found my partner watching porn. I was very upset and we had a massive row! We eventually calmed down and he promised me that he would not do it again. Tonight I came home to find him on a porn site again, pleasuring himself! I have also found out that he has been taking drugs leading up to the wedding and now I am not sure if he still is. I want an annulment as this is not what I want and I do not feel like I can continue with the marriage anymore? Are his actions enough for me to get an annulment?

20081107031409AAr1xPd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does my EX just want to get laid?	Ok so I've been broken up with my ex for several months now and I havven't even seen him in a year but recently we started talking again friendly-like it seems he's still interested in me and still loves me and all of that stuff but we've kind of been in this place before (ever since we broke up).       I was his first GF, his first sexual partner, etc. and I don't think (I mean I don't know for sure but I think) that he hasn't been with any other girls or dated any other girls and I can't help but think that what ties him to me or makes him still "interested" is that he thinks I'm a "sure thing" because I suppose I'm not totally over him and I think that's obvious to him.      He's treated me like **** in the past and I'm the one who ended it but I always seem to go back around to talking to him again.      While he'll joke with me and talk about casual things he has a tendency to re-hash old sexual encounters and talk about "favorite times" and stuff (Hope I'm not being too bold here!).  Is this just a "guy" thing that they do because they haven't been laid in awhile or does this signal something that (to me) would be more serious?  (Which to me is that he's primarily interested in sex.)      Do you think that's all it is or does he still care about me in some way?

20081107223953AANO3lR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How many of you would support a ban on Divorce since it violates the sanctity of marriage?	It's seems that people feel the need to mess with gay people and gay marriage, even though THEY are not gay.  It seems to cover a wide array of people although most people are blaming the Mormons for spending $12 million to pass Prop H8.  So now, in order to preserve the sanctity of marriage even MORE there is a group who is introducing new State legislature to ban DIVORCE in order to preserve the sanctity of marriage even more.  You see it's not only the Mormons but a whole bunch of people who are against the teachings of Jesus Christ where he says NOT to Judge Yest LE Be Judged.  People with nothing better to do just have to make OTHER people's lives miserable as well.      Since the Catholic Church does NOT allow divorce, the new legislature concludes that the state should not condone it either since that goes against religion.  It's a valid argument too.  A group of people figured that if people want to deny gay marriage to preserve sanctity that it's only fair to ban divorce since that preserves sanctity as well.  Won't it be funny when ALL of these people who got divorces find that their divorces have been annulled and they are STILL married to the love of their teenage life!?  Bliss indeed.        What goes around comes around ... it's all good!      Peace, Love, and Light!   I AM    Dartagnon

20081105144618AA1OZzC	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to stay "friends" with this sort of person? Should I bother?	This is sort of amusing, I know. Just try to give a mature answer.      Someone recently added me within the past week from yahoo answers. She seemed nice at first, and a bit overly complimentary. I found her interesing because she was from the UK, and I don't know anyone that lives over there. Then I realised that she is very manipulative and self centered.      She wouldn't respect that I didn't want to give her my address, number, or full name. I know how silly this all sounds, but I hate to block someone.       I simply told her that I am not comfortable with giving that out to someone I don't know. She would still bring it up every now and then, and for whatever reason say that I "broke her trust" for this or that... for even reading her Questions and Answers on yahoo. I wasn't aware that fans were able to see the questions and answers of the person they are subscribed to, and she didn't believe me. She then would try and guilt-trip me into giving out my address, saying things like "I trust you with this, but you're so closed. It bothers me. You won't even tell me your full name or cell number."      So I did end up blocking her last night, since she blows up on me for the smallest things, and is vague when she's mad... so often, I have no clue what she is mad about. Well, the final thing was her gloating over Obama winning. Honestly, I am a Republican but I'm not crying over it. Its just how she kept going on about it.       She comes from an Islamic background. (I have nothing against any race or religion... I may disagree with some aspects of a religion but I don't make blanket rules). I don't know a lot about Islam either, and so she asked me to tell her what I know. I said that I thought Muhammed is a greater prophet in Islam than Christ. Then she talked about how she wouldn't mind living in the middle east, and I said well I guess I wouldn't mind living in Jordan.. (Since I had brought up that a missionairy friend of one of my friends was killed within 9 weeks of going to Iran, and I was just trying to think of a country in the Middle East that I might be able to live in).. and she was like "Oh yeah, Jordan. Much better." I had asked her to tell me what she knew about Islam, since I'm willing to learn and such, but she kept giving condescending answers.      So, should I unblock her for any reason? I hate to cut people off, but she just can't seem to respect me and my beliefs. The answer is most probably obvious, but I want to hear your input. Thanks.
20081105103047AAi9qHv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love current boyfriend, but can't get over ex?	I've been dating my current boyfriend for a little over 2 months now, and I do love him.  He's everything that I always wanted in a guy.  He's a perfect fit for me right now at this time, and I want to stay with him.      The problem is this:  I still can't stop thinking of my ex.  My ex and I were on and off again for a little bit, and decided to stay best friends after everything.  I want to be his friend, but I find it hard to because I can't help but think about "us" when I'm around him.      I can't just ignore him because he is one of my best friends, and I also work with him.      Advice, anyone?       Ever been in a situation like this?  How'd it turn out?

He recently went to Bangkok on a business trip and ever since he returned, he has been asking me to drink his cuum and to let him ejaculate on my hair. I found both these requests disgusting, and asked him to clarify if he had visited a hooker. He says no. One day, he went out with a Japanese (woman) coworker of his. I learn later that he did all these disgusting acts with her. She told me herself, and told me that she enjoyed these. I am thinking of breaking up with this man. What do you say?
20081112072003AAq1g83	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please give me some advice :(?	I've been talking to this guy on msn for months. I'm 16, and he's 23. I've met up with him twice, and on both occassions we've had sex. I'm not a slag or anything. He lives two hours away, so we kinda associated our selves as f**k buddies. He said i mean more to him than that, but he can't help how far away he lives. In february, i lost someone to cancer who i loved for almost 3 years. But now, i told this guy i loved him, and it freaked him out seen as we've only met twice. I kept texting him and ringing him, he avoided me for a bit, and said i was scaring him, cause i was so nice at first but now i'm acting like a bunny boiler. He's having a hard time at the moment, as his nan might die, and he said he just needs some space then he'll be fine with me. I don't mean to be so obsessive with him, i just can't help it. And it's like i got mixed up with my feelings for the person that died, and with him. I really don't know what to do. He could've just blocked me by now, but he hasn't. Help??? =(

20081031154658AArMheL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I continue being abstinent?	I am 21 years old and still a virgin but abstinent.  Mostly, because I was very religious in high school. I'm in the military now and everything seems to be different.  I feel like I'm the only one who's not had sex.  I believed fornication was wrong, and I believed a lot of other things were wrong till I joined the military.  I never cursed, I never had sex, never drank or did drugs, and I really tried to not do any type of a sin.  Many things changed though...I curse now, I just started drinking when I turned 21, and have come close to having sex.  Virginity is a bit harder for me to lose because I was or am abstinent.  I tell every girl I talk to that I'm still a virgin, but I don't know whether to tell them if I'm abstinent or not anymore.  Not like I believe if you fornicate you go to hell or anything.  Many others have sex before marriage.  In fact, I don't know a single person who waited till marriage. This has produced problems where the girl will decide to not be with me anymore because she wants to have sex.  I just want to see some other opinions on this sort of stuff.
20081106092234AAvBbpj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	 Hi, I've been working somewhere recently. Me and this girl I work with always cross eyes and look away... We haven't really talked but we keep getting that eye contact and looking away thing..   I think she's just as shy about it as I am.... when ever we are around each other I feel a tension and it seems like she does too. I'm very much so attracted to her but i try not to stare and gawk. I think she may thinking the same thing.      I guess I'm a shy guy and I get this strange with this one and I get a strange feeling. How can I tell if it's mutual? Does she look at me because the chemistry is right or something or is it because she doesn't like me and feels the tension?      She's my kind of gal and if it's mutual I would like that but if it's not it would be awkward working there.

20081110035908AAnyA34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend Is Tracking my Activity on Yahoo Answers?	One thing I liked about Yahoo answers is that you could post a question and within a few hours it was so far down the list until you really had to search for it to find it.  Some times I'd post something about me and my girl.  An argument we had or a discussion that didn't have a resolution.  I'd come here and ask you guys for advice because it didn't seen she was understanding me.  Yes, we'd talk about it first before I brought it here.  Ok, for a while always thought that she was tracking me.  Now it's been confirmed.  She was in the shower the other night and her laptop was open and logged in.  I clicked on Yahoo Answers to see what she had done.  Come to find out she's set me up as a contact, her only contact.  Meaning that when ever I post a question she receives an email saying, "Hey, your contact so-in-so has posted a question in Yahoo Answers."        That's how she seems to know everything I post.      I will from now on no longer use my main Yahoo page.  I will be setting up several to use here and there as to keep her on her toes.        Does anyone else do this.  Track the activity of someone else? Your boyfriend or girlfriend?  And is this fair to the poster to know they they can't post an anonymous question without it being thrown up un your face later in the day?

She is Dutch i think. All the guys in the office havea thing for her.       I realise she is way younger than me but I adore her. I took one of her pay slips & a pencil that she chews. I have them at home. Last week she was the only woman working in our office. I couldn't help myself but i went into the toilet to feel her spirit. I ended up fishing out her sanitary pad from the swing top bin. I keep it in a plastic bag at home now.      Should i tell her how i feel about her? Should i write her a card?

20081112073013AAKXC8b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend seems to make a better boyfriend than the boy?	I've been together with this guy for close to a year now, and he's enlisting in the army next year, while I'm going overseas to study. He's sweet and nice and all, but he's so picky about money and he's the cheesy sweet kind of guy that other girls seem to like but not me (I'm more of a cut-the-cheese kinda person?).       My best friend, I've known him since say, 3 years ago. He says it himself - he does everything a boyfriend should do that my own boyfriend doesnt. He kept me company when I was stranded outside, my boyfriend couldnt do it cause he promised a movie night with his two best friends -.-" the best friend listens to me whenever I have problems that I cant tell the boy, and he likes me, he told me. Everyone around me tells me that I'm better off with him, but I dont know if I'll have the flutters for him if I do decide to go with him, and I dont know if its worth risking our friendship (which I treasure a lot) trying this out, cause I dont want it to be weird after..         I dont know what I should do. To leave the guy, be single? stay with him, stay confused? leave him, try it out with my best friend?         help?
20081227022411AAr5FA9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	That was my first kiss??? It happened so fast...!?	So my boyfriend came over today and we watched Parkour videos, played DDR (Against his will whee ), and just... hung out. At one point he says "Hey,"   Me "Yeah?"   Him "C'mere."    Me "*Sigh* Ok."   Him after I go to where he is "Look at me." (I have trouble keeping eye contact with people)   Me "Fine,"   Him "You promised me a kiss... *wink* "      And then we kissed. It was so quick! Like Uh, was that it? Don't get me wrong it was pleasant and his lips were soft.  :o ) the whole time and after he left I was like "Damn!" Later on he texted me and said "You're lips are really soft. :-]" so I guess he'd been thinking about it too.      After texting awhile, he said "I miss you." I almost didn't say it back because while it's true I miss him too, I feel weird saying it- even through text. I want to be able to tell him things like "I miss you" without feeling weird about it etc., but >.O

He got me out of my self pity (2 year abusive relationship where I lost all...I repeat ALL...my friends and half my family) I have a hard time trusting new people (though I try)  and that makes me love him all the more since he's the only one there for me...

We were actually almost dating, but then he found out he was moving and had our friends tell me because he couldn't do it. After that we didn't really talk. I haven't seen for a long time. But we got to talking and he still has feelings for me. He is  a good kid and it really hurt him that he hurt me. Now I can't decide. I really like Chayse, but then Collin is all of a sudden back in the picture. We going to sit with eachother at lunch tomorrow so we can "talk and try to figure things out" or at least thats what he said. I have no idea what to do. I'm so confused.    Can anybody help me?

I'm thinking of the possible relationship between their lack in effort during dating and their lack of effort during marriage to work out problems.
20061204053313AA9oy73	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i give up now ? question about fitting in?	hey ..i dunno why seems nowadays im getting more frustrated , Is it because of teenage life thats y i keep on asking about life, IS it ok ??, i dunno y my life is becoming like this . is it my fault for not socialising more with people . im 16 trying to find a friend that can run along this hardship life . i' a good listener , a good guy . I pray and worship the lord like 5 times a day and every time i finished my prayers i will always asked for that special person to come even my on my birthday wish ...but hardly this person is still not here. IS it that hard to find good friend nowadays, how i wonder ..   im a lonely guy , i tried goin out more often but nothing help .end up me walking alone goin nowhere. Im sick and tired for looking this person and i would know if i should give up searching , because searching for that person is like searching for a needle in the haystack ..plus im breaking down , i have no one to talk to except myself ,, btw im not socially retarded ..
20081115164734AALkGqr	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think I handled this situation well or should I have said something?	Well I was in one of my classes on Friday and we were on laptops and me and two of my friends, not close friends but I get on with them well were looking through photos and they were laughing at some of them which I found mean and one of them they were looking at was one of my other friends who I'm quite close to and when they were laughing I felt so uncomfortable I gave one of them a look to kind of signal it's not right what they are doing and then they stopped laughing. But it was so mean and I wish I said something but I've never fallen out with any of my friends before and I felt if I did confront them then we would start arguing and I didn't want that. But what have we come to if people nowadays, my friends out of all people laugh at the way people look?

20081113174759AA92Sie	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I leave them alone with their love life or should I intervene?	I have a lot of friends whose boyfriends are jerks and they know it but they love them too much to let them go. I hate them for acting that way and I just go really angry that sometimes we fight but in the end they try to talk me out of my anger and convince me that they are not all that bad but they are.       Let's just say my friend's name is Nera and her boyfriend is a jerk because he's disrespectful, selfish, manipulating idiot. She knows that and she thinks she can change him but she is not really aware that her boyfriend's attitude is that much of a problem and it's affecting everyone.      My second friend... let's just call her Franny and her boyfriend is a player and she also knows it. Whenever the guy tries to leave her for another girl she stops him and intensely flirts with him to get him back.         I don't know if I'm the wrong one. Maybe I'm just jealous because they spend time more on their boyfriend than they spend time with me or maybe I just don't want them to get their heart broken or I really just don't know. But Nera is currently angry at Franny (but Franny doesn't know) because Nera thinks Franny is irresponsible at picking a boy but what Nera doesn't know is that her boyfriend is also a ******d (:D)         Any helpful words? Tips? Advice? Really harsh comments that would probably make your account go bye bye?

I got involved with a girl who was with another guy and we fell in love.She promised me she would leave him and finally she did but she dicided that she was gonna need some space and time to sort her self out so basically I moved on.Almost 4 months later shes been trying to contact me only able to talk for a few moment cause she's now living back with her parent and there strict with her.Shes been waiting to get a new cell so we can talk but hasnt gotten one yet so I still dont really know whats going on with her.I just got a new number cause my old one was long distance for her and others in my family but she doesnt know that yet.I hope she calls me before my other number turns off.Her parents dont want her using there phone to talk to guy friends (Stupid) but I found their number listed in the phone book and thought about having my sister call and ask for her so I can give her my new number.I know she wants to talk to me but I dont want to bug.What should I do?
20080302170908AAE0p5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going on with him?	Ok, so I probably know, but... My boyfriend of over three years, whom I live with has turned into someone I don't even know.  He started working mass overtime, staying out all night with friends and not answering his phone.  When I tried to talk to him about it acouple of weeks ago, we got in a fight, and he told me to move out, then said he was moving out, couldn't take it anymore, ect.  Fine.  I started the moving out process, and he decided that he wanted me back.  However, right after promising to try and work things out w/ me, he left again, nowhere to be found.  Last week, we talked about our relationship a little, and he admitted he broke some boundaries that we had in  place, ones that he wanted.  Then yesterday, he told me that he doesn't want a girlfriend, I have to move out. Today when he came here, he got angry because I wouldnt give him a hug/kiss hello, and was bitchy to him.  Um, HELLO?  What is going on, anyone?

20081118125520AAsCHGh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Abusive Husband??????????????	My friend (she is basically my sister) her husband and their two children recently moved to New York.   They needed a place to stay and sense I have a pretty big house and live alone I told them they can stay at my place for as long as they need to.   But it didn’t take me very long to notice that Sally (my Friends) husband doesn’t treat her right.   The first day I heard them yelling and fighting, I sent the kids to there room to watch a movie, so they wouldn’t hear, but they heard anyway and they looked kind of worried (they are both 10).   Anyway, the next day I planned to talk to Sally about the yelling, but I noticed bruises and scars on her arms.    I asked her what happened and she got really defensive.   I confronted her husband (not the best decision) and of course he denied the whole thing.   In the end Sally finally admitted that they would fight and when he was drunk he would hit her, she said it didn’t happen very often and he always felt really bad about it the next day.   I kicked him out of my house and I am trying to make sure he stays away from Sally and the kids, but I know that he is going to come back and I am worried for Sally (she is weak and will let him back in)       My father abused my mother and I never understood how this happened, I would never allow myself to be in a situation like this and I don’t want to be rude but I think Sally seems really weak to put up with this especially because of her kids (he has never hurt them, he only hurts Sally. But still no one wants to see this happen to their mom and its giving them a screwed up view on relationships) I also just don’t want them to turn out the way I did, because I have a lot of trouble with relationships and just trusting others.      I know its not right to judge, and I really don’t know what to do or say, I do know that if he comes back and if she lets him back in her life, I will hurt him because both Sally and her kids do not deserve to be treated this way.      Any ideas of what I should do or say to make him stay away, and to help Sally and her kids?

I mean, when I'm with him I'm happy enough - we have fun and stuff - but sometimes I sit there thinking 'What the hell am I doing?!'      We've talked about our families etc, and he's told me how his parents dont really care much about him and never really take interest in what he does. And his family have a few problems. He's always telling me how he always screws up everything good he has and he doesnt want the same to happen to me and that I'm the best thing thats ever happened to him (cheeeeesy!)       So I think he feels more for me than I do in return. I mean...he said THOSE three words after like, 3 weeks! Which for me was too soon but I felt I had to say it back because I didn't want to lose the friendship (I haven't really got anyone else to hang out with!). I mean, maybe I do love him but sometimes I just think of him more as a friend - or best friend even. I haven't told my parents, or family, cus I don't want them to know about my private life but facebook is bugging me. My sister wants to add me on facebook but because I have it set as "In relationship with..." I can't add her cus I REALLY dont want them finding out.      I've tried explaining to him my reasons why but I still don't think he gets it, and if he can't be happy enough with my decision I dunno, maybe I should end things here. But I reaaaally don't want things going sour - I feel kind of trapped and I have no idea what to do. Help?!

20090128160500AAR6rSv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls and Dating (high school)?	Ok so I'm in grade 12 and I like a few girls in gr. 11 and 10. I just broke up with my girlfriend a few months back and I'm looking for a new girl to date. The thing is, all these girls I find cute in gr. 11 or 10 are girls I've never even talked to, just girls I've seen around in the halls, and I have them on facebook. The problem is, I don't know the best way to approach these girls without seeming creepy? In the past I've messaged girls inbox's calling them cute and thats how I starting dating my previous girlfriend, after meeting there and getting to know each other. But are there better ways? And another thing is they have no clue who I am, so i'll just be entering their life out of no where. They may like other guys at the moment... so yea I guess im a cute guy and mature, so it can't be that hard?      Any other solutions?
20090114131011AAdZzea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it better to be in a relationship that you know isn't working out, or just move on and be alone? ?	I'm very much a romantic at heart and because of it I really am only happy in a relationship. However, what should I do if I'm thinking about pursuing a relationship where I know we fundamentally disagree on somewhat important things both socially and romantically?      I hate being alone. I really hate it. Is it unhealthy to stay in a superficial relationship, or unethical to be looking for someone more like me?        I really don't believe this woman has any investment in me as a person--which is what goes against my sense of romanticism so strongly; plus its a really new, light thing right now. I now she's still seeing other guys. I just hate being alone.          Thanks!

20090128152743AASc6Zx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I end it with her?	I found out today that my gf is not a virgin. She said she has had sex with 4 guys in the past. I'm still a virgin. And if she was to ever be my "first" I would want it to be special for both of us. I feel like if we ever go to that level I'll be giving her my virginity, but she won't be giving me her's in return. You see what I mean? If I had already lost my virginity, I could care less how many guys she's slept  with in the past, but since I'm still a virgin, I feel like I'll be the only one giving up something. We have been dating for almost a year and a half now, and I just found out yesterday. I've been  kind of shunning her since. I really care for her and she cares for me, it just bothers me. I don't know what to do. I'm still in shock because she looks so innocent. Its not even like it was just once she had sex with FOUR guys. I would have been the FIFTH! What would you do? If it matters I'll be 16 in July, she's 17 right now and will be 18 in December.

20081114145923AA8lgfH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this rude guy like me?	There is this guy in my homeroom class who apparently "hates" me, my friend told me who is friends with him. I overheard him calling me a retard and a deaf person. I am not deaf and at least I don't talk like a deaf person like he does. It's rather annoying, because I don't know why he hates me if I haven't even talked to him ever in my life. He gives me these creepy hatred stares in class, but apparently he does with everyone. If he has a crush on me, he is showing it in a sh*tty way. I heard that boys are sometimes rude to girls they like, but this guy goes beyond. He is making me hate him, rather then like him back. He doesn't say he hates every girl, only me. I shouldn't care, but I do. I care that someone hates me that much and I don't know why. I should ignore him, but hearing talk sh*t about me every day is lowering my self esteem and making me less able to confront him about it.       Also, he doesn't have the balls to say these things to my face. I hear him say it to other people but never to my face. At least I have a reason for hating him. What should I do? Does he really like me, or does he truly hate me for no reason?

Never skipping once. No, not sex dreams. Just he always shows up. I think about him at least once a day, more normally. We're good friends and have been for three months now.

At my school, to het honnor roll, you have to get 88's and above. I got an 87. Which I think isn't bad since English is a difficult subject for me.      My mom calls the school to complain to my teacher because she thinks he kept me off the honnor roll on purpose. She leaves a message and hangs up.       Then she starts yelling at me for like no reason. Now she's screaming, "Why didn't you got to your teacher for extra credit!?"    "Why would you let your grade drop that low!?"       I said your being rediculous. She then ran up to me and tried to slap me across my face. I blocked her slap and pushed her away from me. Then she's screaming, "I your mother! Don't you ever raise your hand at me!"      I think she was high or something. She told me to go to my room and i did so things wouldn't get worse. When she realizes what I have done, she tries telling my dad that i said, "Your (f word) rediculous!"       My dad didn't even believe her.

20070314061556AA1eZav	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Helpp? advice needed?	this is the story...My best friend had 2 house parties at her house. She told me to my face that she was having them but wouldn't invite me. I got really hurt by this! She told me the reason's why she didn't want to invite me were because certain people dis-liked me. I really got upset by this and wrote her this note out of a bit "of anger"         So Angie wouldn't invite me to two of her parties because "other people there" didn't like me. And because i guess she's so concerned with what other people think about her. She's so concerned with what other people think she'll do whatever to fit in! It doesn't matter if she's hurting someone else what matters is what other people think about her. Well...Angie I have invited you to EVERY PARTY every EVENT I've ever had at my house and now you go and tell me that because someone doesn't "like me" you aren't going to invite me? That's f*** up. Some of my friends didn't like "someone" (cough) you know who I'm talking about! But i invited her anyways because you know what I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO CARES WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK!!! I DON'T CARE!!! And if they don't like that person DEAL WITH IT! Why should one person NOT be invited because another person doesn't like them...i hope in college you learn to grow up!!

20070524123854AAoe38q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going on!?	A week ago my boyfriend and I broke up. For a few days there I went on begging for him to come back hoping he would but he chose not to. Now, he wants to talk to me Sunday about it. He said he needs some space and time to think about things.     Well, I haven't spoken to him in two days now and I'm very confused about the way I feel. There are times when I just think about text messaging him or phoning him etc. But then there are times when I don't really care.    There are times when I feel like I want to cry and feel miserable and let down usually in the morning's but by afternoon I'm normally feeling a lot better.     There are times I sit there and write notes at work to him expressing how much pain he has caused me with the things he said and there are times I just don't care.    Now that I know we are meeting on Sunday I have so many doubts. I'm not sure if he will even be home Sunday, or if he really will talk, or anything...    Part of me does not even want to see him...at all...WHY?
20070509180309AAhpP0T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! girls only PLEASE!!!?	Well, I'm very confused here it involves my bra. I went to Victoria secret got measured and found that I was barley a 32 A mind you I'm 19. I would wear there push-up bras in hopes that it would help "push me up" and the only thing that would happen is the bra would rise so high up it was disgusting. It was almost up to my neck that's how i guess "big" this bra was on me.     So i went to a department store Target and purchased a bra from there. I was told I was a 32 B and surprisingly fit into this one bra very comfortably. The problem was the bra was not a "push up" and therefore i still looked very flat chested. I bought two push-up bra's from there and the first time I wore them I had no problem they were perfect and the strange thing was in push up bra's I had to wear a 32 A! Well, after washing them the bras ride up though not as drastically as the one's from Victoria secret they still tend to ride up a lot and my breasts are now to small for the cups....

20081009213859AAOlkQd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice needed - getting back with an ex?	I dated this guy last year for about 3 months.  He dumped me, and we didn't speak for 2 months.  After the 2 months, we started hanging out as friends.  Now, 6 months later, we are basically best friends.  We speak daily, and are getting along perfectly...but just as friends, no kissing/hand holding, nothing at all.  I went on a date about a month ago with someone else and my new bff/ex expressed his jealous feelings.  He hasn't dated anyone since me, and nor have I excluding that one date.  I have too big of an ego to ask him to take me back since I was the one dumped.  Although, I was going through some hard times back then, so I know I was no treat to be around most of the time.  He says he broke up with me because he felt like he couldn't make me happy.  I totally want him back, but I think I send him mixed signals as to not seem desperate or loser-ish.  So he is surely unclear of my wants (if he is even considering them)     Should I wait around and see if this will progress?  Should I make a move?  Should I let it go and just be his friend?   Thanks for your help!

Then he dated the girl after the guy broke up with her and then he broke up with her too but he's still mad at the guy. I told him bros before hoes but he doesn't listen. He tried to add the guy on facebook now but I told him it was dumb if he wasn't going to apologize (he kept doing things to him at school) but he said he wasn't apologizing. Then he got mad at me and said I never stand up for him and has been crying since. Is this  a teenage thing? please help he is 18 I do not know what he is going through.

20081214142955AA3kO6I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend takes... way too long to get hard?	My boyfriend and I were hooking up, we've never had sex before, but we were going to last night. It took him so long to get all the way up, though; probably 30 minutes. When he was nearly all the way up, my parents came home so we stopped. Is it normal for a guy to take that long to get hard? Before we dated I sometimes thought he might have been a bisexual.... but i've always thought he was WAY into girls to actually be full blown gay. Do you think he might be gay? Or is it my fault he couldn't get hard quickly? Or is it normal for some guys to take a while; maybe it's some kind of dysfunction of some sort? What do you think?

Im not sure what reason allow you to file for an uncontested divorce are or not, but here's my story. My husband and I got married two months ago. We argue about stupid things, this last time he moved out, changed his number and that was a week ago. Since, he's been verbally and emotionally abusive and is signed up on all of these singles dating websites. Are these grounds for an uncontested divorce or would I be better off trying to get it anulled?
20090406150447AAr40f6	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom drives me crazy - she is soooo negative?	WWYD - My mom is A.NUT. Very negative and irrational. Her and my dad are divorced, she is single, and doesn't have many friends (probably b/c nobody can stand her). She hates that I moved away from home (she doesn't like hubby b/c he "took" me away from her), she hates that I don't include her in every part of my life, and she just always finds something bad to say. And the worst thing? She hates that I have a better life than she ever did/has. I did everything the "right" way...not my fault she didn't. Couple of examples: when we bought a home, she was like "must be nice" and when it was my birthday, I told her I was going for a massage and she said "you must have $ if you can afford that" and she told me I shouldn't have a baby shower for my 2nd baby...just stupid stuff like that.       Anyway, every so often she will call me and leave lengthy nasty messages on my voicemail. She joined FB recently (great) and last night she apparently went through my profile history and analyzed everyone I was friends with. And called and basically told me off, why are you friends with this person, why didnt you tell me about this, etc. She must have been dwelling on this crap literally ALL.DAY or something. I used to let this get to me, but lately, I have been getting better at telling her off, and taking it with a grain of salt. I think b/c she is so negative it actually made me strive to be more positive, b/c I am always looking on the brighter side of things (and that drives her crazy!!!) She's like, you can't always be positive, there are bad things in life....lalala. My BF doesn't like her and has told her off before....so my mom always talks crap about my BF. Hubby doesn't like her either and he always defends me which she hates.       If I were not a nice person, I would have dis-owned her a long time ago. I am just sick of having to defend myself, having arguments with her (instead of nice phone conversations). I am just about DONE with it.

20090406154747AAv8L1v	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys and Girls please answer! Why is he trying so hard?!?	A few days ago I told my crush that I liked him. He responded that he was currently talking to someone else, but he assured me that he wanted to be very good friends. So i kind of stopped talking to him, and now he is doing all he possibly can to win me back as a friend. I have talked to him more in the past 3 days than I ever have. I don't know if he understands that he broke my heart, and being his friend is not what I wanted. I don't really get it because we were never good friends before so its not like he would be losing a friend in me, why does he now want to be really good friends after he "rejected" me, wouldn't he want to stop talking to me?

My ex and i had an off and on relationship that lasted about 4 years. to this day, i would marry her tomorrow if she'd say yes and she knows exactly how i feel about her. we called it quits for the last time in 2003. since then we have spoken at most 5 times, always when something bad happened to her. in nov. 06 she called to tell me that she was engaged. i tried to be happy for her but i still love her. i want her to be happy but i want to be that guy. we didnt speak again until april 07. when we talked, the conversation turned towards our past sexlife and she wanted to meet because we needed closure saying that she doesnt want to end up having an affair months into her marriage. that last part might have been intended as a joke but still! what is she trying to do? Is she trying to make me jealous or hurt? or is she looking for a way out of her engagement? what is she thinking?

I left for vacation with my buddies yesterday and she told me she was hanging out with her guy friend and another girl. Fine, whatever It didn't bother me none. Last night at like 3AM I get a text from her saying she was ALL upset because her guy friend whom I know deep down likes her kissed her. I was mad as hell and we talked for about an hour about it through text message.       She phoned me this morning left me a voice mail and told me how she was sorry for lying but her guy friend never really kissed her he just tried to and she told him she had a boyfriend. She said she made all that up because she felt like I was ignoring her while I was away. It wasn't intentional I believe I did somewhat ignore her but not on purpose.       She said she feels awful about the lie and just wants to leave me alone until I come home!      This isn't the first time she's "over exaggerated" or "lied" about something before!      should I dump her or forgive her?

Me and my boyfriend have been going out for 4 months on the 10th june.   When we first started going out it was lovely, he used to want to see me all the time, we used to go places together, and he used to be really loving,   Now he sees me twice a week for 2 hours on a monday and wednesday, on the weekends thursday-sunday he spends his time going out getting drunk, from what i know of him he never used to do that.   He hates this town we're living in and wants to move to another town, but he says he is sticking around for me, for a while.   I just want him to feel like he did when we first met, but its not the same.   I remember all the things from when we first started going out, im not sure if its me, or if its him.   Hes always depressed about work and where hes living.   Not sure if thats got anything to do with it?   But surely a relationship is seeing someone for more than 4 hours a week, its gradually got less and less over the space of a few weeks, but he says he loves me and things.   I dont know what to do :(

20090225160746AAnhcNU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm married but I have a crush on someone?!?	I recently had a dream about a classmate of mine from last semester. He was in my anatomy class. He's very cute and that I've heard from a friend that he's also married like me. One day, after having a "sex" dream about this guy, I started fantasizing about him. I know it's wrong to feel this way. Believe me, I don't have any intention of cheating on my husband. In fact, I love him a lot. And that in reality I am not friends with this other guy. We barely even talked when I was in class. We sat far away from each other. I saw many girls in class that were checking him out because he's very handsome. But I've noticed that this guy was looking at me because I caught him several times & that he's checking me out. That made me have a little crush on him, without telling anyone, but this place. The sex dream was very random. It's been couple of months since I saw him. I transferred to another school & he's still in the old school I go to.    How can I stop this fantasy about being with this guy, when in reality i'm happy with my marriage. Please help. I can't sleep properly at night and I can't tell anyone because I'll just be criticized left & right.

20090225161305AA7WB7n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you take your ex-spouse of the deed only if she is on there for beneficiary purpose only?	Now they are getting a divorce and he is keeping the house plus all the other bills. When they bought the house she had quick claim it because of her poor credit.  She is on the deed but I think for beneficiary purposes only.  In the divorce there is no division of the house.  Plus there is no equity in the house.  So he thinks she will remain on the deed.  I think when the divorce is final he can have her name remove from the deed.  Does anyone know if that is correct?  He lives in the state of California.

20080409060204AA3q87b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Se siete interessati a qualcuno, magari anche contraccambiati, cos'è che vi farebbe subito diffidare?	Quando siete agli albori di un approccio tutto sommato positivo e contraccambiato, di solito si tende a studiare chi avete di fronte, com'è logico che sia.      Ad eccezione dell'argomento "sesso", che potrebbe essere primario e trainante (magari soprattutto per l'uomo), quale atteggiamento, quali argomenti di coversazione o parole, quali modi di porsi con nei vostri confronti vi porterebbero immediatamente a dubitare delle qualità del vostro corteggiatore (e corteggiato/a)?      C'è qualche cosa che vi farebbe pensare subito "la cosa mi puzza", al punto dal farvi recedere dai vostri propositi amorosi?      Nulla però che riguardi nello specifico sessualità o atteggiamenti inerenti (cioè, per esempio, propensione al fare il "mollicone" con tutte/i), ma qualcosa di molto diverso.

Vi voglio fare una domanda, ma voi vi fidate subito e vi aprite immediatamente a quelle persone che si mostrano interessate a voi e partono in quarta facendo sembrare chissà che cosa la loro passione e il loro interesse nei vostri confronti?      In passato sono stato vittima di questi atteggiamenti e per un tipo del mio carattere è stato facile illudersi, sembrava quasi che chissà quale grande passione dovesse esplodere, era bello vedere che una persona fosse così tanto interessata e lo esprimesse così apertamente!      Peccato che appena illuso a puntino per benino, poi quella persona è sparita dalla mia vita per andare verso altre mete!      Ma cosa passa per la testa di queste persone? perchè tutta questa insicurezza ma soprattutto non sapere quello che si vuole? perchè giocare così con i sentimenti degli altri?      Vi è mai capitata una situazione simile?      Grazie e buona serata!
20080501073838AAuFEDo	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Una vita scissa, può dirsi vita?	Conosco un mare, un oceano di persone che vivono una vita scissa.....il corpo da un lato, il cuore da un altro.      E tutte lì a dirsi che l'importante è cogliere l'attimo, il momento, prendere quello che di buono può arrivare e non pensare mai al futuro......ed intanto sciupano mille altri possibili futuri, agendo così. E rimangono intrappolati nella loro vita scissa.   Dove ad emozione, contrappongono frustrazione.   A gioia, contrappongono noia.   Ad amore, dolore.   A possibilità, immutabilità.      Una vita scissa, può davvero dirsi vita? O si vive solo a metà?
20071018050308AAYYpxH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ma non vi mancano le lettere?	V'era un tempo in cui ci si scriveva con carta e penna, V'era un tempo in cui le donne usavano profumare le loro lettere . Si guardava la data in cima al foglio e la si confrontava con quella del timbro postale, per vedere quanto era stata sofferta la decisione di spedirla. Si guardava la calligrafia e qualche volta si pensava che quella sbavatura di inchiostro la', fosse dovuta ad una lacrima caduta. Si pesavano le parole, si stringeva al petto il foglio , quasi fosse una parte di lei..   E poi c'era l'attesa per una lettera che non arrivava mai e  c'era la gioia  quando incontravi il postino che te la consegnava, ignaro delle esplosioni di felicita' che ti stava procurando.      Ora le mail arrivano sempre, e i contenuti forse sono ugualmente belli...ma io rimpiango ancora la carta e quel profumo d'inchiostro..      che ne pensate? Avete qualche aneddoto da rccontarmi?

20081112024020AAv84kr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What did i do wrong :(( pls pls help..?	hello..   so, i finally asked a girl to prom yesterday..   i kinda did it creatively(?) then i gave her the flower and asked to go to the prom with me then she said 'yes' with smiling.      anyway, after that, i asked her how she is, then she said she was shocked.. i asked her best friends to define "shocked" then they say that its because it was total surprise.. she was basically clueless..      now here is the problem.. that was last monday, then 2 days passed since then, but i dont know if it is only me but i feel like she is not talking to me smoothly anymore..   its like i try to go to her and try to talk to her, then she would just answer with one phrase so i have nothing to continue..      and my best friends(boys) joke around with her, she likes it but whenever i try the same thing (almost exact) then she would usually give me the "face." (you know, like when someone is irritated..)      so my concern is.. what is the problem now??    i mean, she agreed that she would go with me to prom but its like she keeps avoiding me in school.. she used to talk with me but she treats really differently.. i even think of the level that she hates me..   i dont know..      any ideas??

Capita (raramente) di vedere delle ragazze italiane (quasi tutte brutte come la fame) andarsene in giro abbracciate a africani. Ovviamente il motivo di tale scelta va individuata nel fatto che, non trovando nessuno che se prenda, alla fine si adattano a andare con chiunque. Secondo voi ci sono anche altre motivazioni, magari disturbi mentali o cose del genere?

Aiutatemi per favore?   io sono eterosessuale, sono sempre andato a letto con le donne e non mi vanto nel dire che sono stato un playboy, l'altro giorno ero in macchina con un mio amica,e lui ha provato a baciarmi.

E non è finita li........gli ho lasciato fare cio che voleva fare.   ora mi chiedo..........se ho fatto una cosa del genere significa che ho qualche tendenza gay? e cosa dovrei fare?   io amo le ragazze, ma ora mi piace stare col mio amico.    E spesso lo chiamo per vederci, e so sempre come va a finire.   Anche se io sono sempre il ruolo attivo in questo, tutto cio mi spaventa.    ma secondo voi, io posso piacere ad un uomo fisicamente, perchè adesso mi vengono anche i dubbi su questa cosa, sono confuso e pieno di punti interrogativi, perchè ero totalmente libero da un pensiero simile, ora ho un sacco di domande da fare.   grazie

Non solo: altri citano storielline di pura fantasia sui rumeni (guarda un po' il caso eh...), altri inneggianno alla violenza  vera e propria (una voleva riaprire le camere a gas!!!)! cercate nelle domande e nelle risposte in IMMIGRAZIONE vedrete quanto odio c'è.    il mio appello è questo: AMICI ANSWERINI CHE ANCORA AVETE UN CUORE E UN CERVELLO: DITE NO AL RAZZISMO!!! ciò non significa favorire la clandestinità o la delinquenza ma dimostrare la propria CIVILTA'. per questo metto la domanda in AMICI perchè il mio è un segnale di pace e non di guerra!

There's this guy who I have had a crush since I started high school.We started talking once we first met.Now I have known him for over 7 months.We have gotten pretty comfortable being around each other.He is now my best guy friend!He always likes to make me laugh and loves to challenge me.A few times a week we have tickling wars and he always tries to tickle me. We have held hands a few times during the tickling wars.But after I had first met him he had a "church thing girlfriend".What does that mean?He gave me a hug just 2 days ago. And a day ago he had his arm around my waist.Now he and I flirt more and more everyday.He flirts with me every chance he can get!I can't help but wonder if he likes me and doesn't know that I like him or he just thinks of me as a friend.I have tried to hint that I like him and sometimes I think it works and sometimes I don't know. What do you think?How to I tell him I like him without ruining our friendship? Thanks for answering!

20090428155046AA50A7o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ugly or good looking ?	Im 18 years old. In my high school, majority of ppl aren't virgins, drink or smoke weed. I moved from Russia 9 years old. I feel like I cant find a beautiful girl, that's a virgin anymore. Its important to me that girl is a virgin..because I am virgin. A lot of party girls always hit on me, because I dress really preppy and think im a big party guy. I'm a classy guy who likes to dress fancy and drive a nice car.      I seem hopeless. I don't trust pretty girls anymore and it just hurts, it seems beautiful girls turned into skanks and I feel all alone.      That's is why I only had a gf once.   my pic: http://img508.imageshack.us/my.php?image...

20060701235519AAxrcnI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think i can get along with this girl?	We have been together since last year. I love her so much but one weakness that i cannot stand from her is her spending habit. She shops quite alot and never thinks of  her future. She always says that she just likes to enjoy life but in other way that she never asks me to pay for her spendings so i cannot comment her so much. I keep thinking what should i do if one day we get married while she's still with her that habit, i am not sure that i can support her in that way. We are just ordinary employees, not rich people. She's a bit older than me too.

20070109050733AAkUxco	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do guys lie about not caring whether a girl is a virgin or not?	I know this guy that i really like and he wanted to know if i were a virgin or not. I refuse to reply but a month later he asked for the 4th time and i told him and he said,"see how hard was that? i dont care about that" then after i told him he stop talking to me. Now all of a sudden he has bad memory and thats why he won't call me. Well before i told him he would call me all the time now he stopped. Why did he stop if he didn't care? Now its hard to talk to him because he won't pick up the phone. What do i do? Did he really not care or was that to get an answer?

We broke up and now that he found out that I'm havin his baby he wants me back in his life.  He wants to try and work us out so that he can be there for the baby and everything.  I still love him and everything, but i'm in love with the girl.  Plus, he's got this other girl livin in with him (he still lives with his parents thou). Then I haven't tld my parents yet.  They don't like the whole idea of me bein' with girls.  They think its unthinkable. I got grounded once when they found out about my girlfriend so i've been goin' behind their backs to see her and lyin' to them, but i can't help it... I love her soooo much.  They also believe that you should be married before you have kids. I don't kno what I should do.  Please help me!! Who do i be with and should i bee with neither one?? Just tell me something!!!

20070518064638AA2s0kM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Le già fidanzate. Come riconoscerle?	Il single esce la sera, diciamo il sabato.      Una tipa lo punta.   Lui si avvicina.   Lei è gentile, seduttiva.   Tiene viva la conversazione,    gli fa domande, insomma pare interessata.      Ma alla fine, attenzione, solo alla fine,    gli dice "sono fidanzata".      Chiaro: ragazze già impegnate   in "libera uscita" che cercano conferme   della propria seduttività,    facendo perdere tempo.      Lo fanno in tante!      Allora: secondo voi da cosa si può capire   (non solo l'anellino, ovvio: per esempio l'atteggiamento, ecc.)   se una è fidanzata evitando di perdere tempo   dando soddisfazione e alla fine solo un "ciao ciao" in cambio?

I'm asking this girl out to the movies but I haven't decided on the details yet.  I usually get off work around 10 and I heard she's sorta an insomniac so I thought 10:30pm would be a good time to get together.  Is this a stupid idea?      Few other facts to consider   - Should I pick her up or meet her at the movies?   - Am I gonna pay for her ticket?   - She's works as bank teller.  Will she be too tired after 10?   - Is Denny's/I-hop afterwards good enough?   - Crap, am I paying for that too?      So if not 10:30pm then what time should I take her?  Mind you this is my first date.

20080907021450AA82ovt	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Cosa si fa con il mal d'amore ?	Mi ha lasciata , si ....sono sempre io , quella che il suo ragazzo dopo 5 anni l' ha lasciata senza neanche dirglielo. Ho ricevuto alcune sue chiamate , a cui io non risposto ( che scema che sono stata ! , ma in quel momento volevo fargliela pagare ). Dopo queste chiamate poi, c'e' stato il silenzio totale. Ho provato a chiamarlo io , ma e' sparito nel nulla. Sono confusa, triste , amareggiata. E' quasi 10 giorni che non ci sto piu' con la testa. Lo penso sempre , sempre ... Mattina , giorno , sera ...cerco di distrarmi , di fare altro , ma il suo ricordo , i ricordi dei momenti piu' belli con lui si insinuano nella mia mente come dei flashback e io ci sto malissimo. Se dormo , sogno di lui che dice di non amarmi piu' e che non prova piu ' niente per me. Questa mattina ho fatto proprio questo sogno e mi sono svegliata di getto , con un angoscia totale e prepotente che mi toglieva il respiro. Sono andata in bagno , ho pianto ..ma ogni lacrima usciva con uno sforzo e un dolore enorme . Ho lo stesso mal di testa da giorni. Se penso che non lo rivedro' , tocchero' piu' , sentiro' il suo abbraccio mi sento morire dentro.   Non riesco neanche a odiarlo per come mi ha trattato , non ce la faccio , l'amore che provo per lui e' piu' forte , non da spazio all' odio. Sto cercando di odiarlo con tutta me stessa , di pensare alle cose cattive che mi ha fatto ...ma non ci riesco , io non riesco a toglierlo dal mio cuore.   Tutti mi dicono che il tempo fara' dimenticare tutto. Ma il problema e' che io non sono pronta a lasciarlo andare , e' come se fosse una sconfitta , come se mi arrendessi ...una parte di me lo vuole dimenticare , l'altra non vuole ...vuole lottare . Ma lottare per cosa poi ?  Lui non mi ama piu'...non prova piu' nulla..    Ho provato a pregare , ma niente mi da piu' conforto. Cosa posso fare ? Lui vive troppo lontano , oltre oceano e non c'e' modo che io lo possa vedere. Comunque lui , non vuole vedermi.   Ho bisogno di uno psicologo credo , sto veramente uscendo fuori di testa. Se qualche psicologo legge questo mio problema , lo prego di farsi avanti e aiutarmi con un suo consiglio.   Grazie a tutti per aver letto fino qui.

Me and my bestfriend go out to bars and clubs all the time, and we planned to go out next wednesday as we have the day off school the next day. Im 18 and she is 17 but uses a friends ID. this wednesday its her cousin's birthday who is turning 16 so she said she will only go out if hannah *her cousin* comes too. but she kind of assumed hannah would use my driving license ID and i would use my passport. i dont see how its going to work as surely they will notice if two of us with the same id go in near enough at the same time? I don't want my ID taken off her as its my provisional license and i take my driving test soon. Im worried, i think she is too young and will mess up, and i don't want to be responsible for her. but when i said it to my bestfriend she got all pissy and said it would work and she doesnt see why i would have a problem with it.      What shall i do/say? whats your opinion?

Tapi beberapa bulan lalu sungguh tidakk terduga mantan kekasih saya hadir kembali, saya sempat menemuinya 2 kali walau sekedar menonton atau makan2 saja tapi suerrrr..........gak ada perasaan apa-apa lagi! karena saya sangat mencintai tunangan saya.   Sya pikir itu bukan masalah besar jadi saya dengan polosnya bercerita ma tunangan saya, ternyata reaksinya sangat marah banget! Walaupuntidak merasa bersalah tapi karena takut kehilangan dia saya minta maaf dan berjanji tidak akan mengulngi! Tunangan saya menerima maaf saya. Tapi itu tidak membuat hubungan kami jadi lebih baik, skrg tunangan saya jadi dingin banget, sering marah2 kalau lagi teringat masalah itu! Yang ada setiap pertemuan selalu mengungkit-ungkit masalah itu. Padahal saya sudah mengalah, meminta maaf. Waktu saya tawarkan agar kita batalkan tunangan dan rencana pernikahan, tunangan saya gak mau alasannya karena masih cinta sama saya! Kalau masih cinta kenapa dia selalu mengungkit" masalah itu dan membuat saya seperti orang yg sangat berdosa dan tdk berarti! Saya tahan perasaan ini karena memang betul saya takut kehilangan dia tapi lama" saya juga tidak ingin selalu diingatkan masalah itu! Bukankah saya masih berhak untuk menikmati hidup walaupu bersalah tapi minta diberi kesempatan untuk memperbaiki kesalahan? Sebenarnya tunangan saya itu masih cinta gak sih sama saya? Saya capek dengan kondisi ini!   Tolong bantu saya, apa pendapat kalian? teruskan atau putuskan saja? sekali lagi saya sangat mencintai tunangan saya tapi juga saya tidak kuat jika harus merasa bersalah terus"an!   Tq ya

20090130185931AAQf5yv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ok, tell me what your first thought is here...?	I took my son out to a family bike event a week ago, to see an old friend of the family.  I walked inside to buy two waters and this guy walks up and starts going on and on about how much my son reminds him of his son, blah, blah, blah.        Well, every time I went back inside to get more waters, the same guy would walk up to me and tell me more and more about himself and his son.  ***MIND YOU, MY SON WAS ALWAYS BY MY SIDE!        In the midst of things, this man shares with me that he is a single father, and the childs mother passed away and he is new to the area, lived her a month.  From the sounds of things, he had a lot in common with my husband and I, which I made very clear I HAVE A HUSBAND.... I was being supportive.  He tells me he is new to the area, etc., etc.  and he happens to live close to our area.        Now, he askes me if I wouldn't mind telling him where to find this, that and the other for his son and hands me his email address and phone number.  Being nice, I email him with the information he was asking about.        Next thing I know he's IM-ing me, and starts making comments on his lack of sex and how he's hot for some girl, I thought that was good, and he seems hesitant about talking to this girl, so I gave hin some suggestions on how to approach her as a possible mate. That girl turned out to be married and the next thing he's IM-ing me is how he will now need to use me to vision in the process of PLEASING his needs.... so to speak.       Now, there's more than I am going to share right now.  But one of the things I MADE CLEAR AGAIN WAS THAT I'M MARRIED.       Reading this, what was your first impression of this guy?

If somebody, like your boyfriend, said that he would like to leave his job for a little bit of time to be a stay-at-home father just for a little bit, what would you think? Would you think he's just a lazy bum who just doesn't want to work?
20090130193714AAc4xeJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband gets mad when he sees other men check me out... Y?	Sigh!! Today my husband and I went out for lunch together and the place was crowed with young and old men! When I was at the buffet making a plate my husband was eye balling me the whole time.  When I sat down he was red faced, I asked him what was wrong and he said he don't like when guys look at me! I told him he should take it as a compliment! But he said how is he supposed to take it as a compliment when hes got to see guys or a guy basically drooling over me! I don't dress like a hoochy momma! I wear jeans and a t-shirt! I am a huge tom boy - so I don't do any dressing up. I couldn't even enjoy my meal or being with him because he was giving other guy dirty looks if they glanced over. But what makes no sense is it's only with guys that are at least my age (which is 25) or his age (which is 29). But if it's an older guy like late 40's and up he thinks it's funny! If he catches an older guy staring he will start laughing and say "aw look that old guy likes you!" and make some sort of joke! But if they are younger then 40 he gets red and mad! How do I get him to stop doing that!?!?!  He wasn't like this be4 we got married! His mom said maybe he's just afraid of losing me! But he's not! I love him way to much to seek for attention from another man! All his friends tell him to take it as a compliment but nothing helps! I can't even go to Wal-Mart with him for goodness sake!

20090130180342AAcdVC8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Women... about taking your husband's surname when you marry?	I got stuck with a maiden name that I absolutely hate, and I have decided to go to court and change it.  I just always felt like I was meant to be named something else.        I speak Spanish and love latin culture, and want to take the surname of a Spanish great-grandfather (not sure how many "greats," I just know someone was from Spain in my family).      People always say, "Just take your husband's last name when you get married."        I wouldn't put someone down for taking her husband's surname.  It's just that it would really bother me not to have a name of my own.     It may be tradition, but it has its origins in an era where women were little more than property.  It reflects the notion that women were property.  I feel that if I got married and took my husband's name, it would be like saying, "I'm married now, so now I'm my husband's property."        No matter how much I loved the guy, I want a companion, not an owner.  Why is there any particular wish that the woman should take the man's name and not the other way around?  The tradition favors the man.  It seems degrading that society expects me, as a woman, to become an extension of my husband.        Can anyone else relate to what I'm saying?      I doubt that I'll ever get married... I'm 29 and I feel like I missed the boat.

20090130172027AA4TRYK	Family & Relationships;Family	How to start TELLING and not ASKING....Overcontrolling parents?	I'm 17 and the oldest of 4 children.I'm also homeschooled.My parents....are very overprotective/overcontrolling.They won't let me date (EVER), they will remove me from a situation if they know a guy I like will be there;and because I have my own vehicle I am sometimes expected to run my younger brother to his athletic functions (no big deal--I love to watch basketball games as much as he does)....Just don't expect to get gas money often for driving him places.        Anyways, my younger brother (who's 14) plays bball for a high school and tonight he had an away game in a town about 60 miles away.Basketball season's almost over,so I wanted to drive down later (he rode on the bus with his team) and watch his game and the varsity game (I looooooove to watch the boys varsity games.It's literally my only chance to see guys my own age). NO BIG DEAL RIGHT?I'll drive MY TRUCK THERE.I PAY FOR GAS. But...My parents said, "well, it's an hour drive.You've only had your license 6 months(they wouldn't let me get my driver's license till I was almost 17)You can't go. It's a safety issue.Forget about it." WHAT THE HELL? Then,when I said don't have a life at all, and basketball's pretty much the only thing I get to do for fun, they said, "really?You got to go shopping by yourself this week (at walmart on my lunch hour at work) and go to a new youth group (I won't be going back).So you don't need anymore fun this week.You're 17.You don't just get to drive where you want."

HELP ME PLZ! i'm so confussed! and i don't know what's going on!

Or, how many of you don't climax during sex and love having sex with your dude and feel totally ok that you didn't and he did. Would you consider this unfair? would you consider it your "duty" to pleasure your man and not expect him to pleasure you back?      how many people see this as sexist? And what does unfair mean?

I asked her and she said at the time she did not have no one to talk to, but this happened on numerous ocassions. It makes me feel like she's taking advantage of the fact that it's her brother and he's gonna take her side.

I don't know how to find out what age is the cut off for siblings of the opposite sex sharing bedrooms together?  I am stressed out about this because now that I am a single divorced mom I cannot afford to get a 3 bedroom anything.. condo, house, duplex... the housing is terrible around here and my ex will not let me move them (he got the house)... is there any assistance out there?  I guess I can have her sleep with me in my bed but that alienates my son... can anyone who has been in the same situation help me or direct me how to find help please?

20090130191342AAyCKlk	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should my friend do?	He told me that he likes his friend and there very good friends but she has a boyfriend. He doesn't know if she likes him that way. Should he tell her how he really feels? or not risk the friend ship he has with her?
20090130191803AAbnQBo	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm not very good at making new friends, how can I get better?	I am 25 and after high school, didn't really keep in touch with many friends.  I went to one college for 3 semesters, and then another to graduate.  I made one good friend, and met my current boyfriend in college.  Other than that, I haven't met anyone and have been drifting away from old friends faster than I make new ones.  My boyfriend and I have been talking about getting married and it terrifies me to think about who I'm going to have as my bridesmaids... there's really no one that I'm close to that I'd need to be standing next to me!  After college I moved to a different city for a while (with the boyfriend), but knew it was temporary so didn't really bother meeting anyone.  Then I moved to a small ski town for the winter, but that's also temporary.  I am trying to make friends and connect with people, but I always find myself alone and lonely.  I try to always say yes when people invite me out with them, I'm a nice person, and am not always the life of the party, but I don't think I'm annoying or bring it down, either.  I'm somewhat quiet and shy, but I sometimes crack jokes that everyone laughs at, and people seem to like having me around.  But, very rarely do I get invited when they all go out.  They have all been friends longer than I've been around, so I guess I get that, but how do I get invited?  Then, when I say "Hey, you wanna do something?" they always seem to be busy.  What am I doing wrong?  What did they teach in kindergarten about making friends that I obviously missed?  How can I meet new people and form real connections with them?  It never seems to get past the acquaintance stage for me.  What could I possibly be portraying that makes people completely overlook me?

20090130194625AAPsk9u	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I wrong to be so angry at her?	OK so what happened was:   I have a friend called erica. I was under the impression that she was not having a party and that was fine with me. I bought her a present even though she wasn't having one and when I gave it to her she was so happy and she seemed really nice. But a while after I got home I was texting another friend named Brooke and I asked her what she was doing today and she said she was going to erica's party. Now I am pretty angry and upset with erica because she didn't even tell me or invite me. Am I wrong to be angry?

I've come to the conclusion that there is a force of energy that prevents me from getting into a relationship with any girl. I'm always told how cute I look and that I can easily get a girlfriend.

20090130185519AAHQAnG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Whats going on between us?	me and my ex has been talking now as friends. we dont talk for weeks at a time, sometimes even months he's always on my mind cus i love him..its been along time since we been together, but i cant help i still love him, its not my fault he broke my heart..suprinsingly. he know im still dissapointed so i dont have the same respect for him after he dissed me out of nowhere. one night he called like crazy and he kept callin for christmas and new years. we stayed on the phone til 5 in the morning sometimes for no reason..he keeps me on the phone while he watches t.v and i say why you just dont let me call back. and he gives me that moaning voice..Nooo. it was daily attention from him night and day and he flirts alot. then out of nowhere he didnt even give me a chance to talk..he said "thats why i cant talk to you cause i get to close to you"under his breath. i thought that was sweet but his voice tone sounded like he was doomed and he left me puzzled. then outta nowhere he stop callin..2 weeks now. our last words was (text) ex: call me later. me:im not callin lol ex: then we fightin, me:why would you fight someone because of that? he says i dont know yet? and then that was it. i understand why he said he was getting too close meaning he's fallin right..but if that was so, and if you was falling for someone how could your feelings be real if you just leave the person?he wasnt even on that subject when he stopped talking everythng was cool he even said call me back but he didnt respond to my last text.,when i responded i dont know why either.
20090130194438AAGAMHG	Family & Relationships;Friends	How come every guy friend I have wants to hook up with me and how do i prevent it?	Every time a guy askes to hang out I'm so naive and think that thats all want to do...wrong! Someone always puts the moves on me and it makes things awkward when I say I'm not into them like that. I don't get it though. There's no evidence that I'm a slut on campus (and there shouldnt be), I'm not very flirtatious but friendly, awkward, and goofy, and I never ever imply that I'm into them. So ,what is it about me that triggers something in these guys and how do i prevent it? because I'm losing guy friends here and it would be nice to still have some      Oh and I'm not super attractive ,but fairly average looking so i highly doubt its bc of my looks      I'm 19 and a freshman in college   i'm not used to the attention so I'm clueless when it comes to boys intentions
20090130184625AAr0lQq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Wth is wrong with her...?	my best friend ,amber, always tells me when she's feels uncomfortable in certain situations.. and i always listen no matter who im with, where i am and what im doing. buh when i tell her how at lunch i feel uncomfortable with so many people standing around us while we eat, she writes a WHOLE note on facebook on how i complain... like when i say something its complaining, and when she says something its her feelings... like its bothering me so much, like i have no one to talk to if i feel umcomfortable...   like i know i shouldnt talk like this about my best friend, but its bugging me and i wanted to ask u guys if u guys know a way i could let her know this.. in a nice way...
20090130194916AAQEpbE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is miserable, should I leave him?	My husband is a very negative person.  He does not realize the rude and insensitive things that he says to me and our children.  He makes me feel bad about myself on a regular basis.  I am a strong woman, but I have really had my fill of him.  90% of the time he is horrible and 10% of the time he is apologetic and actually tries to do the right thing.  That 10% is why I am still with him.  But it is getting to the point where I can't stand him.  I don't know what would be worse for my kids, for him to be around every day and be critical of their every action, or for him not to be there and then they would miss him.  He recently went on a trip for a few days and it was wonderful at my house and I felt great.  The kids did ask about him (they are 5, 3 and 2), but seemed ok to just talk to him on the phone.  I think he is very unhappy with his life and regrets getting married and having kids.  I know in my mind that I should probably leave, but I still hold on to hope that he will change.  I love my children and being there mother and I don't understand why he is so miserable.  I try to set up "date night" and other fun stuff, but he doesn't have much of an interest in it, I usually have to drag him out of the house.  I am a stay at home mom and feel trapped when I think about leaving.  I have a strong family support, but my father was unexpectedly killed in a car accident a few months ago, so I don't have any financial support, or anyone to watch my kids while I work (my mom used to not work, but now that my dad is gone, she had to get a job).  Any ideas about what to do or how to help my husband be happy and realize what a wonderful family he has?  Also, he won't go to couples counseling because he thinks it is stupid.
20090130183046AABs5Hw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do you think I should do?	I've been best friends with a guy for 4 years now. I don't do drugs or drink or anything, but my friends drinks kinda a lot. We both want to go into the same field for when we go to college, not because we're friends, but because we share the same likes. It's in Florida, and it's fine that it's in Florida. But we had a "plan" since 9th grade. His cousin lives about 20 minutes away from the college we both want to go to. And we could live there together. I like him as more than a friend, and he likes me as more than a friend. The only problem is, my mother. She doesn't like him because she found out he drinks. Now I have a big problem with my mom, she doesn't like the guy I like as more than a friend. And she doesn't like the fact that I'm going to be living with him, even if it means I'm saving a bunch of money from not living on campus.. :[      What do I do?!   And I'm realllllly sorry this is so long. I tried to make it brief.

I am getting really jealous of her other friends right now. I know this probably seems stupid for me to care so much, but please help shes my best friend... thank you soo much :)
20090130191056AA7oSPI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can I save this friendship?	Okay so I have this friend named Hayley. We've been friends since Kindergarten and we've gone through almost everything together. We are in 7th grade now. She is friends with these two girls named Rachel and Cara and they are stuck up and annoying. I call them the "terrible threesomes" I also  have a new best friend named Aubrey and we are friends with this two girls named Katelyn and Zulema and we make the "fearsome foursomes" and so they hate us and we hate them but I am not sure if me and Hayley are still friends...I want to still be friends with her but I think she thinks i'm mad at her. Because the girl named Cara asks to many ******* personal questions and she probably knows I don't like their group and she's ******* lame. Can I save this friendship or is it too late?
20090130194350AAJ0wdJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've suspected for some time now that my Mrs has been having an affair.?	I've suspected for some time now that my Mrs has been having an affair. The usual signs. Phone rings, I answer, someone hangs up. She started going out 'with the girls' a lot recently although when I ask which girls it is always "Just some friends from work, you don't know them". I always look out for her taxi coming home but she always walks down the drive although I can hear a car setting off. As if she has got out of the car round the corner. Why? Is it not a taxi? I once picked her mobile up just to see what time it was and she went beserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.       Anyway, I have never approached the subject with my Mrs. I think deep down I just didn't want to know the truth but last night she went out again and I decided to check on her. I decided I was going to hide behind my car which would give me a view of the whole street so I could see which car she gets out of. It was whilst crouched behind my car that I noticed rust around my rear wheel arch.       Should I take it into a body repair shop or should I buy some stuff from Halfords and try to repair it myself?

So I talked to a lot of people from my old school and I was being really nice and friendly, but then a couple days later i started to hearing rumors that people were saying that i didn't seem as Innocent as before, and that i changed a lot. What is that supposed to mean? I don't think that i changed that much...so why would they be saying all this??

20090130195557AAC2nze	Family & Relationships;Friends	Question About My "Friend"?	The new semester started today, and one of my best friends doesn't have any classes with me anymore. So about an ago, I asked her what classes she had, and she pretty much said that she's sick of me acting like Im so cool and that shes done with me. I thought she was joking, so I said, are you serious? What did I do? So she texted back, Nathan, Just stop talking to me. I don't know what I did, and every time I try to comment her on Myspace, or text her, she refuses to answer me. I'm so upset I'm actually crying, she's a really good friend. What can I do to keep her as a friend?

I went to university in Maryland a few years ago and while I was there I dated a girl and she got pregnant. Shortly after this I lost my visa because I had dropped out of school and got deported. I asked her to marry me so that I could stay but she refused to marry me. So now I am married with a child and want to get custody of my son. I have heard she is still as single mother so it would be better for the child to live with a married couple and to have a father figure in his life. How can I go about getting custody of my son?

20090130184152AABnoBh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend troubles?! Help please!?!?	OK, a few weeks ago my friend (lets call her C) called be a "female dog" and she didnt know that I heard her say that when I went to throw something away. Today, I wanted to hang out with my friend "E" alone because we've been friends since preschool and barely hang out with each other. Three out of four of my friends said thats fine. The one disagreer was C. No C is the one that brings drama everywhere. While E and I were by our selves, C and my three other friends came over to us and she said "Why do you guys HAVE to be alone? Why cant we all hang out together?" We told her our reason and..."I KNOW you are talking about me behind my back and I know you are now Sasha!(my name) Everyone has told be!" I completely disagree with that. After she left she apparantley sprained her ankle on a water bottle. She walks around dragging on the ground. If she sprained it, she would have crutches or would be limping. I would think that it would hurt if you dragged it on the ground! So at lunch, I asked her why she always assumes that it is about her everytime I want to just spend time with someone. All she says is "That she knows I'm talking about her." That doesnt really answer my question! I've tryed to tell her I dont really want to be her friend, but does she listen? No. Not at all! What do I do!?
20090130184334AAvqXFv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does having 5 kids to pay child support for turn women away?	Does having 5 kids to pay child support for turn women away?   I was in a 10 year relationship that ended back at the end of August. During that 10 years my ex and i had 5 beautiful children that I will never trade anything in the world for.      My ex is the one that decided that the relationship needed to end for whatever reason. To this day I'm still not exactly all that sure why it ended. I do know that she had met someone before the end though and that she wanted to be with him.      Her and I have remained friends and still pretty much tell each other everything. I prefer it this way since I know that us remaining friends is good for our children to see. Now her and my kids are over 1200 miles away. I kinda sorta had to move back in with my parents till I could get back on my feet again and am thankful for their help during this rough time in my life.      Now onto my question. I have talked to several woman since August and when I mention my 5 kids, they tend to shy away from me and end up not talking to me anymore. I'm a a decent guy and am not really sure what could be wrong beyond the mention of my children.      I would really like to be able to meet someone again and move on with my life, but feel like I am judged as the type of person that I am because of those 5 children. I'm not sure what I can do and feel as though I may never find anyone again.      What can I do? What should I do? Do I just face the fact that I may be single the rest of my life? Are there women out there that don't judge a man the way I feel like I am being judged?

We both had children with other people before we got together and we have since had 2 together. We have a 12 y/o son and a 9 y/o son. My problem is that lately I have been thinking about his past and it is driving me nuts. I get mad at him for things he did before we got together, I know it is obsurd but I can not help it. He lost his virginity when I was only 9 years old!! He has had one night stands with girls, that he admits he wasn't even slightly attracted to and he didn't even like them. I have began to dwell on these things and I hate it. I am driving him nuts to. He tells me all the time that I am the love of his life and he doesn't want anyone else but me. He tells me that I am crazy to think that anything in his past matters to him today. He says that the kids and I are his life and he doesn't even think about his past as much as I do. Prior to me his longest relationship was about 2 years. I am also the one he chose to marry, I guess that should count for something. Can anyone tell me how to get this crap out of my head. I love my husband very much and I feel that this could possible tear us apart. One other thing. I know of 9 women my husband was with before me and we live in a small town so on several occations I run into these women. Either at the grocery store, at school functions at town events and the most recent and perhaps worst one yet...our 12 year old son is dated the daughter of one of my husbands one night stands. UGH!!!!! I get so pi**ed off!!! Please help me, is it hormonal? will it pass? should I seek counsoling? is there any logic behind my jealousy? Is it insecurity?

Here is the story, when I first met my husband, I was 6 months pregnant by another man, My husband took on the responsibilty of taking care of my child, he decided to have the child's name change legally to his last name through the court but he never adopted the child, When the child was born he never signed the birth certificate in the hospital but during the name change the dept of birth ceritificate and health requested that he sign an acknowledge of parternity and have it nortorized acknowleding he is the father of the child. He has provided sole support for the child's birth until now she is 15yrs old, She has never met her biological father. Now we are going through a divorce and he has to pay $400 a week for the both children is biological and the child he decided to take care of from birth. Now he said he will have a dna, which isn't necessary because we know the facts and would refuse to pay child support for her, Could the judge only allow him to support our biological because she has never met her biological and we have never kept in contact with him. I need help here. Since he took care of child isn't he responsible for her until she turns 18?????????
20090130193134AAXkge2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If you get jealous/possessive in a friendhip/relationship are you crazy? why do i feel so ashamed?	also, would this lead to jealousy. you spend all your free time with this one person. suddenly this person is going through some personal issues with mom/dad. he/she spends much less time with you. and in fact close up to some extent etc. and at times this person cancel plans on you. but if you ask them why, he says he can't tell but some issue came up or he has to go else where and can't say where he has to go. and sometimes he/she just doesn't feel like spending time because he is tired or stressed. slowly, would all of this lead to jealously and insecurities.

20090130194228AA58mjP	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do about my friend?	Me and this girl like each other, and it just started a while ago, but we were friends before that. We were also friends with this other girl, and we were all really tight. Since, when we all hang out we've obviously been flirting, and stuff like that. Meanwhile, this other girl is starting to feel more and more left out, and I feel really bad. If we decide to go out, we know were going to have to hide it from her. I feel kinda stupid asking for advice online, but this site can be really useful, so I would really appreciate any suggestions.

Well she keeps telling him if he leaves he cant have his stuff out of storage.

She took him off the contract went in and told them he left her and they took him off of it so he cant go in and pay it and get the stuff but she wont give him that info so he can do it and she wont let him have his stuff out of the house such as clothing that is about all he is wanting from there. but anyways she is pretty much telling him if he leaves he cant have anything. alls he wants is his personal stuff he told her she can have the car the house the everything that he just wants that stuff and she wont do it! What do i tell him to do?

20090130195745AAajSOl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does this remark from my boyfriend mean that he may want to marry me?	Ive been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years and hes divorced (been divorced for a few years now) and has a 12 year old son who I get along with great.      The other day I was making a joke about his son (not mean, just teasing) and he said "Careful what you say about him...he may be your stepson one day." I was in the next room so I couldnt see his face......all I said back was "If he wound up being my stepson, Id be very happy cause he's a great kid."      Whats strange is everytime I had talked casually about the future/marriage with him in the past, he always seemed to listen but never really comment back. But this comment from him made me think otherwise.      What do you guys think? Was is just a random comment or do you think a comment like that insinuates something more?

20090130200007AAfNnAB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do I handle the rest of my life?	I am living with a guy that I care deeply for and don't want to hurt. He has asked me to marry him I said maybe. But there is somebody who I am so in love with I can't stand the thought of never seeing him again.The guy I am with has done a lot with me and for me we've bought things together. I keep telling him to stop buying stuff but he bought furniture for the house, a car, I feel guilty if I leave because of the debt and he has kids that I care about and I don't want to hurt them either.I don't know what to do I should have never got into this relationship the only reason that I moved in with him is because I felt sorry for his kids he wouldn't stay home he was always at my house he would say the kids were fine but I raised kids I know they need supervision and with one parent dead they definitely need the other so I was willing to give up my life for them. I figured what the heck I like him I could put up with the things that drove me Absolutely insane but I can't. I don't know what to do. The man I am in love with is somebody I met after my divorced it was to soon for me to trust someone but we are great together when were together there is nobody else in the world we don't need any friends with us we make new ones its like the world was made for us I don't want to hurt him either but he'll only wait so long. I feel guilty for thinking of myself and the guy that I'm with knows that and uses that and it works. I wish there was an easy way out but there won't be. I've been taught about sacrafies and I feel guilty about thinking of myself. The guy I love we have so much in common  we like the same sports we both took dancing classes he is great in almost everyway.
20090130200156AAPbXxc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is it OK to have male friends in High school but when your married & an adult, male friends =SEX?	I am married to my High school sweet heart. We did not go to the same High school when we were teenagers but now we go to the same college. I previously posted a question asking if it was OK for me to have a male friend in college and I got mixed reviews. Most people did not see it OK. My husband and I have a strong relationship and we are truly committed to our marriage so I don't understand why it is acceptable for me to of had guy friends in high school, but now that I am married and an "adult" it is a big deal. I am currently a chemistry major and I recently made a guy friend who is also a chemistry major with a similar career goal. He often helps me when I need help with the material. My husband knows about him and he is OK with me talking to him because he knows how hard all my science courses can be. He only asked that I do not meet with him out of school. I really like my friend a lot, but not in a sexual way and he is very respectful and has never made me feel uncomfortable around him. When I tell some of my friends (especially female) friends about him, I feel like I am doing something wrong because they think it is weird my husband does not have a problem with it. Just because I am a female and he is a male does not mean we are going to have sex. Why does society have to make such a big deal out of everything? Why is it so weird that my husband is understanding and secure with himself and the faith he has in my love for him?

At an intersection my dad gets the car going and I notice a police car runs the red and at the same time turned on its lights. I saw my father wasn't going to stop and I said 3 times "stop" and he got really mad about it with the excuse that if a crash was to happen, it would be the police's fault for just turning on the lights but failing to turn the siren on.      But, isn't that kind of stupid?

20090130201302AAIVd67	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	The drama continues.......?	my ex and I started talking again we talked for nearly a week and he was so happy I had called him and we decided one night we were going to get back together. Next day he tells me that he is "kinda dating someone", and he is confused, I ask him if he loves me he says "yes" his family says new girl will not last, have caught him lying about her to make me jealous, and is hyper concerned with whether I am dating. Also this new girl is NOT his type whatsoever, she works at a very trashy bar, and has been described by his friends as "fat" and "skanky" He is a preppy, Abercrombie style guy, who normally wouldn't be caught dead in a dive like where she works. I think he is punishing me for breaking up with him, and I am so sorry I don't know what to do. How can I prove that I am sorry and will never hurt him so badly again and to come back home?

20090130200327AAv9mUB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is this anti-semitic?	My mother is "Jewish"...and by "Jewish" I mean that she goes around saying that she's Jewish when she doesn't practice the religion or believe in it at all. She just says that she is because it's part of her heritage. Her parents didn't practice it either.      The issue with this is that I have gotten engaged to a Christian man and I have decided to be baptised and become a Christian.      My mother is threatening to not come to my wedding, and to withdrawal all funds if I do not carry a prayer book that was distributed to Jewish soldiers in WWI that she carried at her wedding, and her mother at her's. I do not want to carry this book because I am not Jewish, and it seems silly for a Christian bride to carry a book intended for Jews. I think it symbolizes that the bride is Jewish, which I am not.      My parents, especially my mother are insisting that this is anti-semitic. What do you think?

20090130201557AAU0K62	Family & Relationships;Family	Stepdad's cruel & takes advantage of me...?	So I'm 15 and my moms been married 2 my stepdad for about 5 months now. Honestly I've never really liked any guy whose dated my mom after she got divorced. But since hes making my mom happy I've been trying to be nice to him, but I feel like hes taking advantage of the whole father role because hes never had a kid before. Me and my dad are really close but my mom doesn't want me seeing him, so i just call him, but when i do my stepfather pulls the plug and makes up a stupid excuse like your gonna run up the phone bill, so now i just call when hes gone. And other times my stepdad will see me watching the tv and he'll just walk up and change the channel as if I wasn't there first, the first time i said i'm watching that, and hes just like "AND" so i told him to turn it back and hes like i liv here now and ur not gonna tell me what to do.   I haven't really made a big deal about him but earlier today, he pushed me too far. So my mom left this morning for a funeral, and won't be back until Sunday morning. I come home from school, and he's there, but hes supposed to be at work so i ask him why, and he said that he didnt trust me at the house. I didnt say this but I always come home after school when noone is there. At that time i would normally call my dad, but when i didnt my dad ended up calling to see why. My stepdad answered the phone and tells him not to call my house anymore and just hangs up the phone. That pissed me off so i asked why he did that and went to pick up the phone, and he pushes me back and tells me to get out of his face and i said what did i do to u. and he grabbed my arm and through me against the wall and said get the hell out of my face, and i told him to let go of my arm and he said or what and he put his hand over my mouth and then he slapped me so hard that it turned my face red, and then let go and i ran up stairs. i didn't want to cry but i couldn't hold back the tears, and im guessing he heard me crying because he came up to my room and apologized and begged me not to tell my mom and kept asking me to giv him another chance and that he swore if he did it again i could tell my mom. Well until now i've been trying to keep it out of my mind because i really do beleive that he meant it and that he felt bad for what he did, and i feel kinda guilty on my part because i feel like maybe i should hav just kept my mouth shut and walked away after he hung up, because he probably did it to annoy me. If i were to call my mom, would i get in trouble for my part in this?

20090130200815AA9spYz	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is a *****?	My mother is... well the only word i can think of to describe her is a *****. if you knew her as a friend you would think she is the nicest most caring person ever. but if you knew her as me you would hate her to the end of the world. she yells at me for no apparent reason other than "because she feels like it". also i can never do anything right ,EVER, not ever everything i do is wrong in some way. I could giver her everything she wanted, do everthing she wanted. my mother is a clean freak, so, i could clean the house top to bottom scrub every last surface, dust every last corner, wash everything that could be washed and she would still complain that the fireplace was dusty, or that the towels werent folded the right way. all she can concentrate on is the wrong "what did she do wrong now" never what i did right. instead of saying "good job, you got good on your test" she'd say "oh my you are so stupid i can't believe that you got one question wrong on your test". I don't know how much longer i can live with her. i dont live with my dad so he cant help, and i LOVE my dad to death i would kill for him thats how much i love him, because he understand how i work and how i learn and how to get the right reactions out of me. i would love to live with my dad but he lives in scarborough and he works shifts so it would vary from nightshift to day shift to evening shift. how can i deal with her im not good at telling her how i feel and even if i was she's not good at listening. i don't know how to deal. ( im 13 soon to be 14).??????????????????? HELP ME PLEASE!!!!!!!

20090130201219AA8oHL0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What ?! Does it make me a bad person because I love my kids more than my husband?!?	I would never exactly tell him that.    But I was reading up on here about how alot of people say they love their husbands/wives more than they're children and that they think people are stupid who are so wrapped up in their children.    My love for my children is so natural, I love them more than anything, I have two boys, I would die for them, cut off my arm for them to live, I thought thats how every parents was, but now im seeing not so much.    Do others love their children more than anything in the world like I do ?! Or am I just nuts?! Your children are yours forever and ever, people get divorced.
20090130201438AAetEFv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Problems with down stairs neighbors ?	Me and my wife moved to a upstairs apartment about 8 months ago. At first the down stairs neighbors seemed ok but after about 3-4 months they started complaining about the noise my children make, I have a 6 and 2 year old the 6 yr old does not make too much noise, but my 2 yr old seems to have a heavy foot step ( also I don't think the floor has much insulation in it if any), and sometimes she gets mad or just doesn't think we treat here fair and she will throw a fit as most 2 yr olds do. Anyway so far the lady that lives downstairs has come up and yelled at my wife about our animal children, here husband too has come up, They have called the police on us and said that I was beating my wife and kids upstairs. Also the husband left a very threatening message on my wife phone saying he was going to come up there and hurt us, and just recently  the lady sent a letter to my wife citing all kinds of lies about how we treat or kids and threatening to turn us into child services if we don't be quieter. I work alot so I am not home all the time what should I do, I know the easiest thing would be to move but I don't like to be pushed around and I have heard they got some one else kicked out for this same reason. Help please!!!!
