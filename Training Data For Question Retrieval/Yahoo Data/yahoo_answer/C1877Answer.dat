jzex4ncSaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Taken from Wikipedia.org<br>  The first TCP/IP-based wide-area network was operational by January 1, 1983 when all hosts on the ARPANET were switched over from the older NCP protocols. In 1985, the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) commissioned the construction of the NSFNET, a university 56 kilobit/second network backbone using computers called "fuzzballs" by their inventor, David L. Mills. The following year, NSF sponsored the conversion to a higher-speed 1.5 megabit/second network. A key decision to use the DARPA TCP/IP protocols was made by Dennis Jennings, then in charge of the Supercomputer program at NSF.<br>  <br>  The opening of the network to commercial interests began in 1988. The US Federal Networking Council approved the interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial MCI Mail system in that year and the link was made in the summer of 1989. Other commercial electronic e-mail services were soon connected, including OnTyme, Telemail and Compuserve. In that same year, three commercial Internet service providers (ISP) were created: UUNET, PSINet and CERFNET. Important, separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged with, the Internet include Usenet and BITNET. Various other commercial and educational networks, such as Telenet, Tymnet, Compuserve and JANET were interconnected with the growing Internet. Telenet (later called Sprintnet) was a large privately funded national computer network with free dial-up access in cities throughout the U.S. that had been in operation since the 1970s. This network was eventually interconnected with the others in the 1980s as the TCP/IP protocol became increasingly popular. The ability of TCP/IP to work over virtually any pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth, although the rapid growth of the Internet was due primarily to the availability of commercial routers from companies such as Cisco Systems, Proteon and Juniper, the availability of commercial Ethernet equipment for local-area networking, and the widespread implementation of TCP/IP on the UNIX operating system.<br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  -de|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	From all that I have read the Internet that we know today was developed by many smart people from many countries. I don't much about ICANN or the national registrars, but it seams to me that the Internet is a global infrastructure. I say it is best to let those who can run it the best run it., so actually no one person invented it.

The first one is to install a copy of Malwarebytes. Since most of your defences have been disabled by your Virus you will have to download Malwarebytes on another computer (Malwarebytes.org) and transfer it to your computer. Disconnect completely from the internet (Cable) and install Malwarebytes.<br>  <br>  Run a scan preferably in safe mode. Tapping the F8 key within the first few seconds of turning your computer on should get you to a menu where you will select safe mode.<br>  <br>  Run a quick scan and remove anything it finds. <br>  <br>  If your Virus disables Malwarebytes you will need to rename the MBAM.exe file to another name. Use "Blah" if you wish and reinstall malwarebytes. Try a scan again.<br>  <br>  The second choice is to download a free copy of Trend Micro Hijackthis. Run a scan using the previous instructions and remove suspect items from the list.<br>  I'm not able to tell you what to remove as i don't know what kind of Virus you have but you would be looking for BHOs for sure.<br>  <br>  Just be carefull what you remove<br>  <br>  If nothing seems to work you will need to reformat your hard drive and install Windows fresh.|`|lsKAp1qEaa	You sounded like a newbie and have serious malware infections.

Even in a component, (Motherboard, Psu, and so on), that is fairly new.<br>  The Electrolytic Paste oozes out of the capacitor.<br>  These 'Caps' are made of three layers of material, and placed into a small aluminum 'can'.

Sometimes it works okay, sometimes it doesn't, and the computer starts having problems, that you would swear are software related.<br>  <br>  When the paste loss becomes more, than even for this type of behavior for a capacitor, the capacitor fails. <br>  There are three main voltage rails in a computer power supply.<br>  The 3.3 volt rail, the 5 volt rail, and the 12 volt rail. (Even Psu's that have multiple 12 volt rails, still get their power from -> ONE 12 volt rail in the power supply)<br>  <br>  When the capacitor is in a weakened state, or a few capacitors, the power supply has a weak voltage rail.

AA11703028	hi william<br>               this is a problem with the way you have connected the case power leads to the motherboard,theres a few connectors that if connected the wrong way will stop your pc powering off like it should,and then theres the reset connector that is responsible for what it says<br>              check your motherboard manual and there should be a reference to how to correctly connect the leads from the case,and if when you have connected them they dont work as they should try turning them around<br>               you can download a motherboard manual if pdf form from <a href="http://www.foxconnchannel.com/support/downloads.aspx?ProductModel=A6VMX&TypeID=en-us0000001,and" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxconnchannel.com/support/do...</a> there will be a up to date guide to how to connect these<br>             however theres a feature built into motherboards called "soft-off-by-power-bttn" feature and this allows you to choose either instant off(turns system off straight away) or 4 second delay(push the button for 4 seconds before the system turns off),however when the system is in 4 second delay mode the suspend mode is enabled by pushing the button momentariliy<br>             you will find the "soft-off-by-power-bttn" option in the bios "power management" section,however after setting this feature remember to also press "save and exit setup" on the main bios screen to save the settings you have made to the cmos(permanent bios memory)..your p.c will then restart after saving<br>             once windows has fully booted wait for around 5 minutes(or until all updates have finished) and test the power button feature,if it powers off after 4 seconds then thats fine,however if its still not right try turning the connector on the motherboard around(button pw_on)<br>             any problems let me know<br>                     good luck william !|`|skgN9TJLaa	If your not going to turn your computer off the normal shutdown way and you want to switch it off by holding the power button then just unplugging it has the same effect.|`|gpYFsrhDaa	1) This may be due to corrupt driver of your Video card, try updating your video card drivers.<br>  2) There may also be possibility that your SMPS (Power Supply) has run out of power try changing your SMPS, or if you have low power SMPS get high power(Watts) SMPS than the current one.<br>  3) There are many other possibilities, such as RAM as well.|`|AA10585855	It could be BIOS or it could be the operating system.

bruL6qanaa	There are essentially two ways to overclock your computer, increasing the multiplier rate, or increasing the frontside bus speed. To increase the pulse multiplier you can either set jumpers, or change values in the motherboard's setup screen, but chip makers do not appeal to over clocking, so they have locked the multiplier rates. To bypass this you would have to add traces between circuits (which takes experience and great knowledge about circuits). To increase the frontside bus speed you need a motherboard by a company that supports over clocking, you can then make changes by using the controls provided in the set-up screens. If you are going to do this, you should do it in small increments to prevent over-overclocking, which can cause overheating. I wouldn't recommend it for an inexperienced computer user like you, but if I had a motherboard that supported it, I would do it (being an experienced computer user).|`|jBipWFPaaa	Don't listen to that idiot saying it will shorten your PC's life. It won't, he's just stupid. <br>  If you overclock it TOO much, then that might cause your system to fail, but when you boot it back up, all you have to do is change the settings back and everything will be back to normal.<br>  Try doing it right out of your computer's BIOS, which can be accessed by pressing F1, F2, F10, F12 or DEL right as your computer turns on. I wouldn't recommend blindly mashing all these buttons, because your screen will probably tell you which key to press as your PC turns on.<br>  Try it! <br>  It's good for increasing performance in video games.<br>  Also, if you have an NVIDIA graphics card and an XP computer, you can right click on your desktop and overclock your GPU from the Nvidia Control Panel.|`|AA11557030	There are a couple ways to overclock as computer. The first being from within the bios settings and the second is windows based programs. <br>  <br>  Overclocking will be different on different systems with the most options on custom made computers. If you have a main stream tower from Dell or the like you are most likely out of luck unless you get into the higher end systems.<br>  <br>  Cooling is one of the main things in overclocking and decent components. Forcing a Yugo down hill so it goes faster will only lead to a major crash leading you to buy a new car. Overclocking is about the same idea...|`|Z0aJFf4Qaa	Adam B, cdabexx is far from stupid, more heat decreases the life of any component, and that's basic stuff. <br>  <br>  The point you could of mentioned (but failed to do so) would be that most processors on average are designed to last 10 years, and the likely hood of somebody using the same processor/computer in ten years time is slim, so shortening a component of  2-3 years to get an additional boost and keep the processor up to date for a couple of years is worth doing.<br>  <br>  Overclocking isn't something that should be rushed, read tutorials online, there's lots about, but definitely go into the bios and have a look around, most standard 'brand'/dell bought computers are not capable of overclocking.|`|FJYsZQ7Kaa	There is no free lunch.  Or, You get what you pay for.<br>  It is possible to over clock almost any pc.   You don't say what you have.<br>  Older  processors run hotter, so even a slight relative small clock could fry your processor. <br>  So first clocking will reduce the life span of your cpu and even other components.   It does not mean they will last a week, they could last for years, but still less then intended life, which of course may not matter at all. IE you may only get five years, not ten.<br>  <br>  Some boards help you clock, but if you are an amateur then you will not have one of these boards, I do.    It allows clock speeds to differ from say, memory to processor.  If you don't have this, you may clock your processor and fry your memory. <br>  <br>  Go on to forums and read about clocking.  Intel core processors are good at clocking, but most will need a better heat sink and fan. IE  I have an Intel E6750 I replaced the stock heat sink and fan with  a freezer pro7.  I have taken my 2.6 gig cpu to 3.2, but had to increase voltage, some people have gone to 3.6 using the same gear as me.  but they are taking a greater risk.  As more heat  can destroy your cpu.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	It isn't recommended as it will shorten the life of your pc.

DnaNcANqaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  All DDR, DDR2, etc. is dual channel really (newer boards/memory controllers are using three channels now). Whether it is used as such depends on the memory controller (usually on the motherboard or CPU) uses it as such. It usually also has to be installed in the right slots (generally color coded).

Then I had to use a cord with a headphone jack on one end and RCA connectors on the other. i plugged the headphone jack in my laptop and hooked the RCA jacks to my TV. You may have an HDMI jack on your computer that you could use. That will only be useful if your TV has the same input though.

Also you need the ports on both the computer and laptop or else it wont work.|`|8x7VkHhIaa	Laptop to TV cable connections are not rocket science. They’re easy and simple. All you need is the proper cable and a few adjustments to your laptop settings.<br>  <br>  Cables & Jacks for Connecting Laptop to TV<br>  <br>  The first step is to inspect both your laptop and TV and identify the connections, easily located on the back of either component. There are five basic types of jacks, or ports involved:<br>  <br>  *Composite/phono plug (RCA)<br>  <br>  *S-Video<br>  <br>  *Video graphics array (VGA)<br>  <br>  *Digital video interface (DVI)<br>  <br>  *High-definition multimedia interface (HDMI)<br>  <br>  *An RCA connector, sometimes called a phono connector, is used for analog audio and video components. Three round, colored sockets are standard — left audio is white, right audio is red, and composite video is yellow. These are standard jacks on older TV’s and laptops. A three-prong cable, readily available at any computer or electronics, is the easiest way to make an RCA laptop to TV connection.<br>  <br>  *S-Video, or Super-Video, a more advanced analog video connector, uses a four-prong round plug, like those used in TV cable installations. Separate audio cables are the same as for the RCA connector, left audio/white, and right audio/red. S-Video is commonly found on older TV sets and some laptops.<br>  <br>  With S-Video on both TV and laptop, connecting a laptop to a TV is a simple matter of a single S-Video cable. If your laptop has a great sound system, you won’t need audio cables, but for better quality you’ll also want audio cables.<br>  <br>  RCA to S-Video cable, a special laptop to TV cable, is available when you have RCA jacks on one device and an S-Video port on the other.<br>  <br>  *A VGA connector and cable are used to carry analog video signals plus display and graphics data. The VGA is a 15-pin connector commonly found on laptops and other devices. With this port you need a PC-to-TV Convertor to connect laptop to TV. You simply plug the VGA cable from the source into the convertor, and use an S-Video or RCA cable out to the TV. The converter is USB powered, so there’s no external power adapter to carry around, making this laptop to TV connection entirely portable.<br>  <br>  *A DVI port is rectangular with 24 pins arranged in three horizontal rows of eight pins for digital video; separate RCA analog audio cables fit into white and red plugs. DVI ports are found on Macintosh laptops; sometimes they are smaller than normal DVI ports and require an adapter, which usually comes with the laptop.<br>  <br>  *The HDMI port, one-half the size of the DVI port, is also rectangular with 19 pins. It provides digital audio in addition to digital video, despite it’s smaller size, for a complete TV to laptop connection. These ports are found on new HDTVs, and sometimes there are two or more. TVs with HDMI ports are the only ones that do not require additional audio cables.<br>  <br>  TV’s with a single digital port labeled HDMI/DVI require only one cable when the source is another HDMI component. But when source is a DVI laptop, you need a DVI-to-HDMI cable for the video and a separate pair of RCA analog stereo cables.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Whenever ports do not match, you can by adaptors and/or cables to make any connection.<br>  <br>  Tuning<br>  <br>  The second factor in a laptop to TV connection is proper tuning. If the screen resolution and aspect ratio of your TV screen and computer are not the same, the TV picture will be distorted. This is important whether the screen is LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), or non-LCD flat-screen.<br>  <br>  The screen aspect ratio is a monitor’s proportion of width to height. Prior to 2003, most computer monitors had a screen ratio of 4:3, the same as standard TVs. Since then, ratios of 16:10 have become common, especially in laptops. HDTV has a ratio of 16:19; and motion pictures and still photography have even different ratios. One common example of a screen-ratio problem is when wide-screen video is shown on a standard screen. The result is undesirable letter-boxing, with black bars filling the screen at top and bottom.<br>  <br>  Similarly, screen resolution varies between monitors. Resolution is measured in number of pixels across and down. Laptop LCD screens range from 1024 x 768 to 1920 x 1200 pixels, for a 15- or 17″ screen. HDTVs and wide-screen TVs have pixel resolutions varying from 1920 x 1080 to 1366 x 768. Unless your laptop screen and TV screen are the same size, adjustments have to be made to pixel ratio to ensure the best connection from TV to laptop.<br>  <br>  Make sure both screen aspect ratio and pixel resolution of TV and laptop are compatible. You can adjust both picture ratio and resolution with the Display Settings on the Control Panel of a PC laptop. Mac laptops automatically adjust settings for screen resolutions and ratios; if necessary, the adjustments can be tweaked in System Preferences. Your laptop user’s manual and manufacturer’s Web site provide information on settings and options for video output.<br>  <br>  These few guidelines are the basics for making the right connections tha|`|UssZadhFaa	It depends on what type of inputs your tv has and what type of output your laptop has.  You can probably do it, but the cable you need to buy will depend on a)whether  your computer has a vga, hdmi, or dvi, or other video output and b) whether your tv has hdmi, vga, (I know a few flatscreens that have these two) or just the standard three-part yellow-white-red cable (I'm not sure of its official name.)  Once you know this, you can just go to radioshack and you will be able to find a cable with the two proper ends.  Plug it in, set your tv to the right channel/setting, and it should work.  You may also have to put your laptop into presentation mode.<br>  <br>  oh yeah, and S-video imputs/outputs on your computer and tv should work as well if you have them.|`|GXMTwCLTaa	YES! it depends, what connections you already have on you're laptop and t.v.

Then after that review your video, and drag the video bar to the place you want to edit it to, finally- add your music! TA DA! :-D|`|n5DlXdsCaa	I'm afraid my computer's terribly slow and won't let me draw a diagram. Since so many others have told you what to do now, there's nothing else to really tell you. Sorry for leaving a dud answer! However, when people are saying "split the video", they're talking about a feature on Macs. On Windows Movie Maker, you click on the end of the video, and, while holding the click, drag it to wherever you want it cut off.|`|7h8LTrahaa	Ok simple mate. First off you know how to import the video right? and its in the right format. About the music, See the Set Audio Button next to the Mic Image? You move the bar to music instead of the middle, so the sounds are muted. To cut the video, See where the video plays in the mini player? on the screen, how there's a Play - Stop buttons? at the end of that bar there's a Camera The button before the camera splits clips allowing you to shorten them or erase certain parts. Click on the imported files in the TimeLine get the Blue line to where you wanna split it then press the button.<br>  <br>  Sorry if that's to complicated :D|`|66gK5Gkkaa	First to edit certain parts, make the video line look grey. Then, highlight what you want to take out, then press delete. And sadly you can not mute a video clip, sorry. :(|`|0WsNbCjmaa	Ok so to cut out half the video u can use ur phone on the edit thing.

McAfee must be avoided.<br>  <br>  To continuing receiving updates you will always need to renew Norton also. Norton won't update for free. And update s are extremely important, its why we have to pay yearly.<br>  <br>  For an unbiased test report of virus detection capabilities, go here:<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</a><br>  and click "Comparatives" on the left, then choose #19 and #20.<br>  ______________________________<br>  <br>  But do you really want to spend a lot of money in this  bad ecomomy?<br>  <br>  Very good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"<br>  <br>  For good computer security on a Windows computer, and to prevent virus and other malware you need to do a minimum of 4 things.<br>  <br>  1. Run a firewall.<br>  <br>  2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.<br>  <br>  3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,<br>  <br>  4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  My recommendations:<br>  <br>  1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".<br>  <br>  2. For your Anti-Virus......I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  (Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products?)<br>  <br>  <br>  3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...<br>  SUPERAntiSpyware:<br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br>  <br>  They have a free version.<br>  <br>  4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important, unfortunately often overlooked by the user, but not the black-hats that code the malware! They know exactly where the weak points are.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" rel="nofollow">http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...</a><br>  <br>  Its free as is everything else here.|`|1WgOj89kaa	Norton Internet Security 2009 is the best security program at the moment, it is the fastes and best performance money can buy.

AA10006450	If you spent more than ten minutes editing the document, then MS Word should have been automatically saving intermediate versions in case something happened and you were not able to save it.<br>  <br>  Here are some hints I found:<br>  <br>  Finding and using the temporary and auto save files<br>  <br>  Word<br>  <br>  The default auto save time for word documents is 10 minutes. You can control this time in Options under the "Save" tab. The auto save files are placed in one of the following two locations, which is where you should look to recover the data.<br>  <br>  1. "C:\ Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Microsoft\Word".<br>  2. "C:\ Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\Temp"<br>  <br>  When you have found a file that looks like it might contain data, you may want to open it in notepad instead of trying to get Word to reassemble it. The easiest way to do this is to open Notepad from the start menu then drag and drop the file in to it. The file will then be opened so that you can view the contents.<br>  <br>  If the document was open when the system failed (power failure or crash) then you could try just opening Word again (not the document, just Word itself from the start menu). Word will then try to recover the lost document.|`|kWxhWET7aa	If you forgot to save it then you're screwed.

k5KuYkkKaa	A registry cleaner is necessary to maintain your system and keep it running at it's best. Companies are aware of this and try to take advantage of this by selling it to people who don't know that it's available to them for free. These companies pay the magazine publishers to advertise their product, and when we see these ads in those magazines, we feel they are safe to use. Most magazines don't tell us that we need to buy this product, rather they tell us that this product does what it says it will do. The scam part is that when people see it in a reputable magazine, and read the advertisement describing how necessary it is and at a seemingly low price, they feel they are getting a deal on something they need, when in fact, unknown to them, they can get their registry cleaned for free elsewhere. The companies are preying on peoples lack of knowledge.|`|7h8LTrahaa	Some work mate, I personaly use CCleaner, which has a registry cleaner built in, i just make sure it dosn't change any windows files.

To actually get the money from there, you can connect your paypal account to your bank account so that you can transfer it.

It really is a good investment, because with an alienware computer for example, your paying up to $ 300 for the name on the computer, whereas if you had build your own, thats a perfectly good graphics card right there in that $300.|`|Qr4jw7lQaa	Buy a new computer if you want it for gaming i suggest NCIX.com they have some really good computers for cheap. it would be too costly and a huge hassle to upgrade.|`|f8uzRc3Daa	No way to upgrade your PC if you want to try new games, so go to new one

(You cannot, however, run both at the same time.)<br>  <br>  Linux is for people with above-average computer knowledge. The people who develop Linux are trying hard to make it more user-friendly, but it simply isn't there yet. If you've never used the command line / terminal (or don't even know what I'm talking about), Linux will require plenty of learning time.<br>  <br>  If you want to give it a try, you actually can without installing anything at all. Just go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download</a><br>  <br>  Download, burn to CD, and run. (You will probably need to change your BIOS settings. It's not complicated, but again, some computer knowledge is assumed here.)<br>  <br>  In my opinion, from my experience, Linux is superior to Windows in every way except user friendliness. It's easier to find programs to do what you want (assuming you know how to find, install and use them the Linux way) and it is almost impossible to get a virus or otherwise accidentally get your computer messed up with Linux. It's also developed with a much better mindset (of freedom) and a much better platform for anyone interested in learning more about computers or programming.|`|9vMz9rxMaa	Linux doesn't HAVE to replace Windows if installed.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people suggest that you either install or "get" something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 2: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	Is that 32GB you're mentioning correct? <br>  <br>  I thought you needed more than that to run Windows XP. I would think most of your computer is compleatly filled up with XP. Very much a dinosaur. <br>  <br>  I doubt you're going to get much for it as 1 GB of RAM is also not that much that's about 2 sticks of 512MB of RAM My new computer has 3 GB of RAM. A lot of newer computers have more RAM than that. <br>  <br>  If you're lucky you might be able to sell it for a $100 to $150 and I am only saying $150 as you're throwing in all those extras with the accessories.|`|4yNhkOBzaa	I agree with the first answer.<br>  <br>  This computer is insanely outdated. Normally I tell people to sell their old computers to people who only need them for word processing and e-mail for like $100, but your computer is hardly good enough even for that these days.<br>  <br>  Although, the parts individually are even more worthless. So hey, why not try to get $40 for it from someone who just needs the basics?|`|AA10407603	1.5 GHZ is pretty old ...but considering your offering a scanjet and a deskjet with it... I think $150 is reasonable. I know you probably paid much more. Computers depreciate quickly in this day and age. You'd be lucky to get $150 in my opinion..if you get $200 your a professional.<br>  <br>  My only question is...do you still have the restore CD's, or at least a legit copy of the OS?|`|ylE8APbuaa	For me this specs are not worth it neither it is only for a junk<br>  these are the thing that you must replace...<br>  <br>  Processor: atleast 2.1 GHz or 2.4 and up<br>  Monitor: try a LCD monitor it saves more electricity bill that CRT<br>  RAM : make it 2GB..|`|NARak4iBaa	32GB hard drive?  Wow they use to make those?  (I guess its better then my xbox 360)<br>  <br>  You would be lucky if you can sell it for scrap parts.  This is not even worth $100.|`|i5JpCDG5aa	Put out on sidewalk with free to good home sign. So you dont have to pay to get rid of it.

People obtain viruses by what is called "phishing" which means that you clicked on a false site and logged_in with your private name and password.  You  just have to make sure that you're uploading things from a website with a verifiable certificate as well as inputing information into a legit site.|`|i5JpCDG5aa	Well you wont break a leg.

It's not "on" Facebook. It relies on your downloading and running programs without making sure you're getting them from a reliable source and knowing what they are. That isn't safe no matter where you do it from.|`|d2N3C1IDaa	Well, my dad got one virus from myspace. Not sure how, proabably because of the ads. But photobucket is definitely safe.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	If you notice this after you have turned off your TV or PC monitor, it is only the system components cooling off. They contract as they cool and can make a creeking type of sound. It's normal.|`|cLUwf3rraa	It's just cooling off. The heat from inside makes the outer shell expand, and when you turn it off it contracts because it's cooling, thus resulting in the sounds you hear.

IyCnihLmaa	The monitor uses the most energy.<br>  <br>  It is harder on the computer to turn it off and back on and is one of the reasons some computers break more than others.  My computer has been on for four years with only occasional reboots and when I'm gone for an extended length of time and it has never had a problem.|`|ERfL13kFaa	yup, lots more energy actually. Think of it like a giant light bulb (a really expensive and full featured one) you should turn it off if you wont be using it for an extended period of time
NARak4iBaa	Those are different things. <br>  <br>  A Pentium 4 processor can run at 1.66 OR at 2.8  So you could already have a Pentium? <br>  <br>  Also .99 is the same as 1 gb of RAM.  So don't worry about the RAM.  <br>  <br>  If anything just go to dell and buy a $350 computer and you will be light years a head of what you have now.|`|LK8EEZxGaa	.99 RAM is basically 1 GB of RAM so you should be fine but depending on your motherboard you can buy more RAM and a new processor i actally have a pentium 4 processor on my comp which died just last week. for RAM and a processor go to newegg.com or you can go to a nearby computer store and ask them if your computer cn handle any more RAM or if it can use a pentium 4 processor<br>  <br>  Also  crucial.com  shows you what and how much RAM u have and how much u could increase it by|`|1909cVAaaa	upgrading is most of the time more expensive than purchasing new one.<br>  you must change your processor, the problem is,is your mother board is compatible to the latest processor that will comply to your need?probably not.Also, you must buy RAM,anyway it is much cheaper than processor.adding up the cost of your upgrades is much more than if you buy new one that will comply to your need.And the bullshit thing is,at the end of all upgradings,it just end up fail to attain the speed that you require.<br>  Just a freindly advise,take new one with the specifications satisfies your job needs.|`|GSE1JqAwaa	without hearing any specs on your current computer its hard to say. The ram would be no problem to upgrade. <br>  <br>  The cpu is going to be the harder part, and most commonly your going to have to buy a new system. Mainly because of what the motherboard can handle, the cpu socket style/model, and the power supply.|`|AA10412818	If your not sure you can always check with the manu. website I.E. Dell, HP, Compaq, Gateway. to see what CPU's the motherboard is compatible with. Secondly, for about the same cost as upgrading your CPU and RAM you can buy a "decent" pre-build machine from places like walmart for around $400.00USD. to upgrade CPU and RAM your looking at around $200.00USD as a min. So those are my 2 suggestions, I hope either one of them will work for you.

Or you can go to your Start menu, navigate to each of the programs, right-click on it, and select "Send to... Desktop (Shortcut)."
ktdMxaGuaa	Don't believe everything you see on TV. The possibility that someone can do that is slim to none and based on a lot of factors including the quality of the source image, just how blurry it is, and the skill level of the person editing the picture. You can up the contrast to help reduce the blur, but you will then get a grainy quality to the image. <br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do things in photoshop you really should take a class to learn how to use it. There isn't a magic button to make the pictures do what you want.
AA10446546	Some of them are merely troll question, but some of those sex/masturbation/baby/period questions are really questions coming from someone having trouble with their sex/masturbation/baby/period. <br>  <br>  If you don't like it, go to categories that doesn't have to do with sex/masturbation/baby/period. Computers & Internet, Science & Mathematics are the categories I follow, and I rarely met those sex/masturbation/baby/period questions. <br>  <br>  I think some categories, like Health, Pregnancy & Parenting will naturally have those kind of questions.

BdZJCRr2aa	Yes you can be successful in Web Designing. Website designing is not limited to illustration. There are websites with lots of illustration work there but it all depends on what kind of website you are going to design. If you are designing a business website, that doesn't need illustrative work. More designers are using ready to use objects (images, illustrations, buttons etc) for their website. <br>  You can start designing websites without knowing illustration, but i suggest to start learning illustration so your strengths become more stronger.

If the air the PSU is drawing from inside your case is really hot to begin with, perhaps it's the thermal stress over time that's killing your PSUs.<br>  <br>  That's one of the reasons why some manufacturers like Lian-Li and Antec offer cases with isolated PSU compartments so the PSU does not have to use pre-heated case air to cool itself.  If the temps inside your case regularly approach 40C, you might want to consider one of those isolated-PSU computer cases.|`|GSE1JqAwaa	Dumb question probably, but do you have everything plugged into a surge protector, if so maybe get a new one and make sure your not overloading that plug.

2piMuhxraa	A dll file is the same as an exe file except it has no user interface. The computers language is assembly. Assembly consists of the instructions that the computers processor is wired to perform and is the hardest to read. An instruction such as add 10 and 20 might look like this: A6 0A 14. Because assembly is so hard to work with, compilers were developed, and Delphi is a compiler. With a compiler, you can write an instruction like A = 10 + 20, and the compiler will convert that to A6 0A 14. Source code is the more readable code that the compiler compiles into assemby. There are many compilers available and thier source code languages differ. Visual basic uses basic, Delphi uses pascal, there are C and C+ compilers available. So Delphi is the opposite of what you are looking for. What you are looking for is a decompiler. I have never tried to use one but I know there are some available.<br>  <br>  So to directly answer your questions:<br>  1. No, Delphi will not read and edit dll files but you can get a 30 or 90 day trial.<br>  2. Yes, you can open it in notepad. Right click and say "Open With..." and select notepad. Soon you will discover why compilers were invented because you won't be able to understand any of it.<br>  3. A decompiler.

6YufKn6Faa	Hi.<br>  <br>  There isn't much difference between the two motherboards.Basically the same, same chipset, max memory, memory speeds supported, hardware such as LAN Controller, Card Slots, etc.. <br>  <br>  Here are the differences I see<br>  <br>  Memory Slots: The DS3L has 4 slots for 4 DIMMS of memory, while the ES3G only has 2 DIMM Slots for Memory. (Both have a Max memory for 4GB, so its up to you, rather you want 2 or 4 DIMMS with a total of 4GB of DDR2 1066/800/667)<br>  <br>  DualBIOS: ES3G has DualBIOS, while DS3L has a virtual verison of DualBIOS. Virutal verison works just the same, but there is no physical chip to store it, more like a little mini drive. (In case you don't know what a DualBIOS is, its basically a replica of a BIOS you can duplicate that works fine. In case later on, some1 messed with the BIOS settings, or you want to overclock, but somehow the PC is on the fritz because of the BIOS, you can always revert, and just change back to the BIOS you replicated. Very handy sometimes, especially when you are going thru a BIOS Update for your Motherboard, then proof the update freezes in the middle or something...)<br>  <br>  Audio Codecs: The DS3L has 8 Audio Codecs, while the ES3G only has 6 Audio Codecs. (Audio Codecs are physical Hardware (in this case) devices that processes audio data by compressing/decompressing audio data into a format you can be played and listened...)<br>  <br>  PATA: There is PATA (if you use it.. however this is old tech also) interface for hard drives if you have a PATA drive. It is only featured and supported on the DS3L model. <br>  <br>  The DS3L motherboard is slightly larger then the ES3G... But it should fine any ATX Computer Case just fine. <br>  <br>  So if you want more audi codec support for sound and need Pata support, then go with the DS3L.<br>  <br>  Hope that Helps. <br>  <br>  Here is the link for future references on any other Gigabyte motherboard models. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Motherboard/Products_ComparisonSheet.aspx?ProductID=2892,2615" rel="nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com.tw/Products/Moth...</a>

HkFfzPyMaa	The voltage output of USB ports is +5 VDC. "Standby" on a computer is a is a power saving feature that is really only needed for Laptops. <br>  <br>  If this IS a laptop: try unplugging it, remove the battery and press the power button to drain residual voltage from the system. Do the same thing with your printer and any other USB peripheral devices.<br>  <br>  If it is a Desktop, unplug the power cord that is plugged into the wall ie kill the power to everything and do as described above.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, some damage may have occurred to one of the peripherals or the system itself due to the voltage drop.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	I take it you're using a hub for connection purposes. Your phone is too much for it, connect it directly to a usb port. It's not unknown, plug-in hubs can handle keyboards, mice etc but not something that takes a bit more power such as a phone.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	sounds like the usb port has a device connected  thats exceeded the power limits of its hub to me|`|WeZcSZvKaa	I must admit I have never seen that message before so therefore the only thing I can assume is that you do not have many USB sockets so you are using USB hubs.<br>  <br>  Which means that you have it full to capacity with the phone and the peripherals are switched on all the time. It's obvious that the hub is up to full capacity already and the phone pushes it well over the top.<br>  <br>  To check that it is not the phone, take everything out of the hub and just plug the phone in and see if it works then and it is not faulty or causing the problem.<br>  <br>  However having said that, USB phones will not work properly through a hub. They have to have an independent socket of their own to be used.|`|gUhve1dHaa	It means exactly what it says on the box......<br>  The device you are connecting is drawing too much power from the hub and therefore won't work properly.<br>  You need to get a mains powered hub rather than rely purely on the laptops power.

o9p5kn1Baa	We are not claiming and have never claimed ownership of material that users upload. The new Terms were clarified to be more consistent with the behavior of the site. That is, if you send a message to another user (or post to their wall, etc...), that content might not be removed by Facebook if you delete your account (but can be deleted by your friend). Furthermore, it is important to note that this license is made subject to the user's privacy settings. So any limitations that a user puts on display of the relevant content (e.g. To specific friends) are respected by Facebook. Also, the license only allows us to use the info "in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof." Users generally expect and understand this behavior as it has been a common practice for web services since the advent of webmail. For example, if you send a message to a friend on a webmail service, that service will not delete that message from your friend's inbox if you delete your account.|`|sGRFbAMGaa	Obviously.<br>  It's called permanent for a reason.

JZeNB1F7aa	The Alt + F4 is just a shortcut key, the instruction is simply close the active open window. I assume you have worked out how to use it as your "awesome" would suggest. For those that have not - you just press the Alt button and immediately press the F4 button and this performs the function.<br>  If you have several Windows open and cant be bothered to close each page clicking on the red X, then Alt + F4 is the quickest method of closing the open items. It works on every program including Word, not usually in PC Games, but it will close the game if the window is open within Windows rather than in its "whole" page state.<br>  There are many shortcuts that are very useful, the Windows key on your keyboard is a similar shortcut and does other things as well. Press the Windows key and E and you get the My Computer page, with R you get the Run command pop up, if you have several pages open you can press the Windows key and T and this will switch between the various tabs (pages) that are open, press enter and the page will be the active one, then the Alt + F4 will close the page all without touching the mouse to make the page the active one and clicking on the red X. There are many more, try it and press the various keys, if a window pops up then you don't need to use it, just Alt +F4 to close it but you get to see what they all do. |`|44d1bd70ebb6dde45e70346ef061d012aa	It closes the current window your are on|`|PzWxekESaa	Alt + F4 is a shortcut to close program on the top of your screen.<br>  yes, it works for MS Word too....|`|kFBd7yfWaa	''BES'' i was bored, but know im not LOL<br>  <br>  No, seriously it will close any open window on you pc|`|DBh90sPHaa	That closes the program that you have open|`|gLzUNP9eaa	increases your pc speed by cooling down the hard drive|`|8pkTsX5Uaa	this is an command used to close any programs running on your pc

QUQY3HQYaa	No it wont slow your laptop down. Unless your running the game and another program at the same time. However you may have problems with the fact that the graphics cards on laptops are usually weak so you may not be able to play many modern games. The only thing a game will do is take up space on your hard drive but it wont slow it down.|`|dILqe7nBaa	any thing you install on your computer will slow it down a little .till your hard drive runs out of room|`|eTLG23N4aa	First of all it's not a Labtop but a Laptop.......Sheesh !<br>  Most newer games will run slowly on a Laptop unless you buy a high dollar one.<br>  <br>  The more you add to the hard drive the slower it will get.

AA10007782	QoS stands for quality of service. Basically it refers to the practice of assigning to each packet a sort of priority. For example you can say, this packet needs to get to it's destination in a hurry. Or this packet is crucial and should not be dropped (those examples aren't exactly right but you get the idea).<br>  <br>  If you are using linux as a router for your home network you should look at the Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO (linked to in the source) that should help you setup packet prioretisation for your network...<br>  <br>  It is my understanding that most of teh internet doesn't use QoS bits so it is probably only going to be your internet connection that it will make any difference...
AA10162294	Yeah. That's usually the default setting.
FBQZ06vraa	The term "Wi-Fi" as far as I know, is just a take-off on hi-fi, or high fidelity, the first big technological breakthrough in recording in the '50's.  I don't know that the letters themselves mean much if anything.<br>  <br>  You do still need an ISP.  There are actually two forms of "wireless" Internet.  The newer form uses cell phone technology and is truly wireless.  The traditional form uses a wireless connection to a landline through a wireless router or modem.  In either case, someone at the other end of the connection has to transfer it to the Internet.  That's your ISP.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|y1Yl6p9Qaa	You have to have the internet on your computer, adding a wireless router to your computer to a lap top for instance as long as it has wireless capability.|`|gNIuzscMaa	All of your answers is here

t5sYXwSqaa	If you can get onto another computer wirelessly then the router is not the problem it is your computer.<br>  <br>  Can you see a small monitor on the task bar (bottom of the screen on the right hand side. It is likely that this monitor has a red cross next to it. Please tell me if this monitor is there and whether it has a red cross next to it or green wireless lines.<br>  <br>  One other point, you have switched the wireless card on on your new laptop. There should be a switch that will either be on the front (near the screen) or at the front of the computer. Failing this look for blue FN key and a blue wireless symbol. To turn the card on with this you have to press the blue FN at the same time as the blue wireless button. The screen will then say card is enabled or disabled. You cannot receive wireless signals without the card enabled. <br>  <br>  If this is not the poblem, post again and I will try to help you further.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Bill S has the correct answer.<br>  <br>  It is either the wireless is disabled, or the switch that controls the wireless card broadcast is off.|`|02FwhyMSaa	Visit the Linksys website for support regarding the setup of the router. The manual with the router should be enough, though.<br>  <br>  As for the new laptop, make sure the wireless is turned on. There'll either be a switch for it on the edge or bottom of the laptop, or there'll be a key combination.<br>  Toshiba = Switch on the front<br>  Packard Bell = Function Key + F2<br>  ...otherwise I do not know, simple Google search will help you out though.|`|dgThRTeLaa	As a last resort, I suggest simply purchasing an ethernet cable and using a wired connection through your router. This is much simpler, you just need to plug an ethernet cable fin the back of your router into your laptop.

SBSH4Zkpaa	2007 is if you want all of the new transitions, templates and other new features. 2003 is better if you need to transfer with people who have 2003 but will not get some key features that you will get with 2007. You can always save your copies of documents as 2003 documents if you are using 2007. But like it's said above, a free program called OpenOffice will open Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. Plus it's free. I like it a lot, except I have a mac and use iWork which is honestly the best. I can almost guarantee though that there will be a 2010 Office so I'd just wait.<br>  <br>  Updated: 2003 is outdated and is not sold by Microsoft anymore. If you'd like it, you may have to buy it from a friend, or Ebay or something. Plus, 2007 may not run on your computer if it is to old. When did you purchase your computer?|`|YnsG3pXraa	I grew up on all versions...first do you know either one? if not try 2003 it's well supported and the most likely version you will find on the outside world right now.  If your an expierenced user of Office and need it I like 2007, there is a lot of great improvements.  You can learn either one for free at Mirosoft.com under 'geetting to know' in Learning.  Also you can download 2007 for free there (MS site) and use it for 60 days free so U can see if it's right for your needs.|`|RddoT7Z4aa	I say 2003, everyone hasn't really jumped on the 2007 bandwagon (I use 07 but have to save all docs in 03 format so everyone else can open them!)|`|I7rS4vq7aa	Openoffice.<br>  <br>  Who am I kidding, I use office 2007, only because I actually need some of the features it has for school.<br>  <br>  I guess get 2007, it's not bad.|`|aFVoMx8Laa	I think office 2007 is quite better.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	You can't get 2003 anyway. 2007 is way better, I love the new interface, it's really simple and pretty, I never get bored by using it, lol.<br>  If you want something similar to 2003, try open office, it's free:<br>  <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>|`|4CHvBjNUaa	Newer softwares are always better!

AA11613911	the pathway for changing it is at www.malecelebrites.com/sploogealert
LF2oShTLaa	Yes it is a low resource based real time protection software, which allows more time on your computer then waiting for programs to run. It has the capability to background run scans to allow you to do as you'd like while security is not being sacrificed. This program needs a minimum of 256MB's of ram, so you don't need to upgrade your computer for more benefits.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

You don't need another real time Anti-Spyware protector KIS 2009 is a full suite. You can use Superantispyware pro which has real time protection if you insist.   Most people have no conflict issue.

81iRxZThaa	Well it took me 3 weeks every time i did it, but im from PA so it depends on how close you live to the repair center in Texas. 9 chances out of 10 they send you a new xbox anyway so i dont see why the process takes so long. if you dont believe me just check your serial number, because the normally fix yours and give it to the next person to send in afterwords it they had a serious repair that would take to long to fix like the rrod. so expect 2 1/2 to 4 weeks or about 3.

It will catch most spyware but it's not part of the protection. It will do a better job with trojans and worms than the other free choices. It is also very light. Avast is really your only other option. It has anti-spyware protection. Is not as strong as Avira with trojans. It will also use more ram than Avira. It is still a good choice. AVG is out, it does not included anti-rootkit protection and since some of the worse threats today are rootkits I don't think it should be on your list.|`|DjGEJfaPaa	Yes Avira is good - it's much better than the wildly popular AVG.<br>  <br>  1.

This is simply not true! There's three really good programs that are free to the public with no strings attached! Use these programs together and they make up the perfect security system that rivals any paid program! They don't slow your computer down like other programs.<br>  The first is M-bam "Malwarebytes"It's an on demand scanner with a really cool tool called file assassin.You can use this tool to delete rogue programs that freeze up your computer and keeps you from downloading and using security programs!<br>  The second is "Superantispyware" It's another on demand scanner that catches what M-bam misses!<br>  Third is "Avira" It's an on demand scanner and firewall "although they call it AntiVirGuard" I use this as my primary security.I have it setup to do updates and scans at night when I'm sleeping so when I go on my computer in the morning it's there waiting for me to review all the bugs I caught the day before! "Note"Until you get your computer clean I would disable the AntiVirGuard It's a little sensitive and can drive you crazy with popups saying your computer is infected.<br>  I found a very good video by Matt Rizos that explains the whole prosess in detail so get out the popcorn and watch this video!<br>  Video:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdWes&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah3efRdW...</a><br>  Downloads:<br>  1.<a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&subj=dl&tag=button" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a><br>  2.<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/superantispywarefreevspro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...</a><br>  3.<a href="http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Personal-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10322935.html?part=dl-10322935&subj=dl&tag=button&cdlPid=10986298" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe...</a><br>  <br>  I set up a couple of blogs to help people like yourself deal with viruses and other problems associated with them!

Keep in mind that if Windows shows your monitor as a "Plug n Play monitor" then it doesn't know exactly what resolutions your monitor supports, beyond what works and what doesn't.  You might have resolution options that actually go above what your monitor can handle, resulting in the edges being cropped off or the view being squeezed to fit.|`|0m1PMsHaaa	Native resolution for the monitor is 1280 by 1024.  That is where you should set your desktop resolution.<br>  <br>  If you set it to a widescreen resolution then everything will look vertically stretched.<br>  <br>  <br>  At 1024 by 768 the image is slightly distorted - you are displaying a 4:3 aspect ratio picture on a 5:4 aspect ratio screen.

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE. IF YOU'RE USING FIREFOX 3, YOU MIGHT<br>  WANT TO TRY A DIFFERENT BROWSER.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	You're computer being stupid. you probably need to run some software like ccleaner auslogics disk defragger and an anti virus program. i like spyware terminator a hell of a lot better then those stupid avg freeware ones.

If you don't have the instruction manual that came with your router, then you will need to research how to access your wireless router's setup page, or admin page. <br>  <br>  Open up your web browser, once it is open, go to the URL <a href="http://192.168.1.1/." rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.1/.</a> <br>  <br>  This will take you to a pop-up box which asks you to enter a username and password.<br>  <br>  The username is either blank or "admin" and the default password is "admin".<br>  <br>  Once you are past the login screen, you are able to access (and change) a plethora of configuration options for your router.<br>  <br>  Don't be worried by the enormous number and variety of options, your LinkSys router ships with default settings that enable it to work right out of the box in most environments.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you consider setting an SSID to identify the router as your own and configuring WEP to encrypt your wireless traffic.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out. <br>  <br>  Cheers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tenmax.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tenmax.com</a> - Free Web Capturing Software|`|76ZOJO1Aaa	Go to your network settings and set your internet to WEP or WAP (WAP is better security)<br>  <br>  Once you do that you can create or edit your password/network name|`|gNIuzscMaa	Dont forget to run a firewall

Then boot your machine using the disc. You may need to change the boot order in your bias setup to have your computer boot from your CD/DVD drive first. Depends on how you have your machine setup.

lrVbZdSDaa	You need to buy a router.  Any standard computer store/bestbuy will have multiple types.  Ask one of the customer service workers about your needs.  If the computers are a short distance from each other, or you are willing to have a long cord run through the house, then wired will be fine.  If you want for more money, however, you can get a generally slightly less reliable wireless router.<br>  <br>  Here is how this works:<br>  <br>  Currently, your internet cable connects to your modem.  Your ISP company then says "Hey, this modem says that this is our client!  Give him ISP!"  So they send you your internet, and the modem sends it to your computer.<br>  <br>  Now we're going to change this slightly.  The internet cable is still going into the modem, but you must now pull the cable that was previously connecting the modem to the pc, and plug it in so that it now connects the modem to the router.  Now the router has the internet.  The router's job is to split this connection between everyone connected to it.<br>  <br>  So now you need to get 2 internet cables, again, ask the customer service workers, and you connect those to the router.<br>  <br>  The final diagram:  Internet goes to the modem which goes to the router.  The router then sends the internet to the two computers through the two cables connected to the individual computers.<br>  <br>  But any router you buy will have diagrams with pictures that should be relatively easy to follow.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	with a wireless router?

azaMkJijaa	Okay then.<br>  <br>  First thing, as far as I know, the ATI 200m is not a graphics card, it is called a chipset (I could be wrong about that). A chipset is similar to a graphics card, except that it isn't really powerful (definitely not for playing games) and instead, it uses some of the computer's resources - as in this case, it uses 256 or so MB of your total amount of RAM. <br>  System Properties shows your total RAM, Task Manager shows your available RAM.<br>  <br>  Second, Windows Vista Home Premium and above should not run on a computer with less than 2GB of RAM. No 'but's, 'what-if's or anything (Home Basic can run with 1Gb, though). I really think you should get one more stick of RAM. Just take it to a computer tech guy, they can get you some and install it for you.<br>  <br>  Third, if you really don't want to buy RAM just yet, do the following. Not as good as RAM, but it will suffice as a temporary replacement:<br>  R. Click on My Computer > Properties > Advanced Tab > Performance settings > Advanced > Change > Custom size: Make both Initial and Max 1500Mb > OK|`|jZ5MnD7Qaa	Your Graphics Card is sharing some of the system memory, you can change the amount it uses in the BIOS. To get into the BIOS, when starting your laptop, look for a message that says what key to press to get into the Setup.<br>  <br>  Lowering this number will lower perfomance in 3D games.|`|OXrFIq2haa	it is probably right. check the bios again for the "Video RAM" allocation amount,This is true for most build-in video on the MotherBoard.You can still add more RAM ( I GB )|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The traditional PC hardware architecture dedicates some of the RAM space to specific purposes, such as VGA video, even though these aren't often used today.  That's why you can't get up to exactly 1 GB of memory even when you have 1 GB installed.<br>  <br>  For a 32-bit operating system, like ordinary versions of Windows XP or Vista, you can install up to 4 GB, of which the system will use about 3.7 GB (for reasons stated above).  If for some reason you need huge amounts of memory, you'll need to switch to a 64-bit version of one of these operating systems, but be advised that there are still lots of issues with 64-bit operating systems, so unless you really, really need more than 4 GB, stick with the standard versions.

pUzJiMUcaa	Learn programming.<br>  <br>  Prior to any language, you should know the basics of computer programming. You should know about how the logic works, you should understand terms like 'loop'.<br>  <br>  C is a bit of a bear. It is a challenging language (and it is still very relevant...). If you have never programmed before, you might consider a language that focuses more on the basic aspects of programming, rather than complex tasks like memory management and allocation. Me, I started with VB...I don't necessarily recommend that, I'd suggest something that uses a C-family syntax structure, otherwise you may find yourself with a few bad habits you need to break.<br>  <br>  As far as where to learn, try starting here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-00Fall-2007/CourseHome/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Eng...</a><br>  <br>  That's from MIT. They are nice enough to post lecture notes and what not on their classes. If you already have that stuff down, check out some of the other classes.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	You don't really need to learn any other programming language before you learn C - but you should first learn computers in general and be considered a "power user".

I have yet to see any justification for a social networking site as being needed for your school work. Your job is to be in school, learning, NOT doing social networking and playing with MY tax dollar paid for computers. Time for you to get back to work at being a student instead of using MY time for your play time. Play with toys on your own time. I worked as a network administrator and maintained the blocked site list for a company to prevent employees form using company resources and time to play with toys like myspace and facebook. I watch for questions such as yours to add to my list of sites to block. Since you are trying to use a proxy to get around the network limits at school, your network administrator is doing the same as I have done, blocking access to non-academic non-work-related sites which serve NO purpose for your school work or job. And, if your admin  is smart, is watching here for this kind of thing to keep HIS list up to date as new open proxies pop up.

Perhaps she was hung over.<br>  <br>  Without seeking to diminish in any way the problem of alcohol in Australia, especially among some northern and indigenous communities, the facts show that average alcohol consumption is similar to that of other English speaking countries except for Ireland, and much lower than in most European countries. The average Aussie gets through less than half the amount consumed by Luxembourgians, the world record holders in high-income countries. I'll have to go to Luxembourg one day for a drink. It sounds like a real party place. The following figures are for 2000 and show average consumption in liters of pure alcohol per citizen aged over 14:<br>  <br>  English speaking countries<br>  Canada 8.26 <br>  US 8.41<br>  Australia 9.19<br>  New Zealand 9.95<br>  UK 10.23<br>  Ireland 14.21<br>  <br>  Selected European countries<br>  Luxembourg 18.56<br>  France 13.41<br>  Germany 12.99<br>  <br>  World record holder for 2000: Uganda: 18.59|`|197c68289edcdabe63d6df09ff3a8da5aa	Not Cool|`|2c509ce080c6258454932169280d44beaa	NO.|`|ce3956aa4e772379c840568a648da43daa	2 points*<br>  <br>  reported*<br>  <br>  hopefully you will be banned and people will not have to put up with your foolish and insulting questions!

If you are attempting to learn the basics of programming you can try: Programming Language Essentials by H. Bal and D. Grune (Addison Wesley Publishing, 1994) or The Programming Primer: A Guide to Programming Fundamentals by L. Ribar (Osborne McGraw-Hill).<br>  <br>  Also there are almost unlimited number of web sites that offer similar information. Try a search in your favorite search engine. <br>  <br>  If you want to learn a specific language then ask about that language and I'm sure hundreds of books and websites will show up.|`|152a171cea4c644d3cc0da550275010aaa	you can read a pic. book|`|AA10116659	C++ for Dummies.

d16e4eaa399a13ea5e47b198dbef10e4aa	In the processor pecking order, celeron is firmly at the bottom of the ladder for speed and efficiency.<br>  <br>  The processor speed is a bit low, but the 1mb cache is a little confusing, your not refering to a due core processor are you?<br>  <br>  as most other people have said, that system would certainly be sufficient for games 3+ years old, but dont even think about using it for modern gaming.<br>  <br>  I think the new Warhammer game has a recommended processor speed of 3.2ghz (which is the highest i've ever seen) so yeah, perfectly fine for interneting, but its not really game spec anymore.|`|1b23ce936c792c9cf475c27c2be3494faa	well, is it possible that you could get another deal for the same price? me personally, i don't like laptops, and i built my PC, but every time you here celeron you kind of shudder, everyone i know that knows anything about computers always talks about steering well away from celeron.<br>  <br>  otherwise, i'd say get a slightly lower pentium and then clock it. it will boost the performance and also, pentiums usually come underclocked.  plus, celeron processors are more unstable than pentiums.<br>  <br>  as someone said before, probably would play games, but wouldn't run much in high detail with huge graphics.|`|AA10145078	This depends. It is decent for a laptop but not really for a desktop. My guess is that you are asking because this is some type of package deal. Celeron is the cheaper version of the Intel company. A Pentium is the way to go if you are looking for a machine with a little more power. In my opinion it makes sense to spend a little more money on a computer that will remain fast for a while then to pay less for a computer that is already somewhat outdated. <br>  <br>  P.S. How much ram is included and what type of ram will be another factor to determine how well the system will work.|`|fe8706ed1ba59ca609952bb4b6cbeb8aaa	For what you want to do with it yes........ it will not play games that are graphics intensive ie: qauke4, doom3, serious sam, ect. but for some older games like starcraft, warcraft 2 yes it will work.... I am an AMD guy and will always be...... but I have to give you the straight dope on the myth of a celeron processor..... In the beginning it was and used to be a cut rate alternative to the pentium but it grew into its own and now it is just as stable as a pentium. So, yes it is a good alternative to the higher priced pentium processors... the price of the laptop should run you about 499.00 ... so don't over pay....|`|405041710c03f358fe511a054697c59baa	depends what for?  my laptop has a pentium 3 , 900mhz(i think) and it's fine for surfing net and doing emails.  i wouldn't suggest playing warcraft on mine though it would die.|`|882ae2725dab6b7ee731818fa34fd4d8aa	not bad

e132136686a756d6484ff235a2bb2cd6aa	I see.  Well, I think you are supposed to completely redraw the screen each time a cursor key is hit. You can do this by keeping track of the current position in the file, and writing the appropriate lines of text to the screen.<br>  <br>  To start with, you might try writing code that just scrolls from the top of the file to the bottom. For example, if the screen displays 24 lines of text, you start by printing lines 1 through 24.  Next, print lines 2 through 25, then 3 through 26, and so on.  It might be wise to put this code into a function, and think about the design of your code.<br>  <br>  Once you get this working, I think you can start enhancing the code to keep track of the cursor position and draw the appropriate lines on screen.
08f3b6f87b92e085cad08af2f3fdd267aa	Compilation is essentially translation from one language to another - From a high level language like Basic, C, C#, Java to the chip specific instruction set. Multiple different commands from various languages will map to the same chip level instruction. Also, one instruction in a high level language may translate to  tens or even hundreds of lines of machine language commands. <br>  It is therefore almost impossible to do the conversion in the other direct on even if you know which language you started out with.<br>  <br>  A decomplier will try to do a mapping but the resulting program will not look like  hand-written program.

If you suspect virus infection, run the antivirus in safe mode so that it gets out of memory.<br>  <br>  To answer this question, we need to find out what operating system you have.  On some OS's (i.e. XP) you can right click on the task bar and select "Task Manager".  If it is not there or produces an error when selected, we need to know what error you see.<br>  <br>  If you have XP, there is a possibility that you changed to footprint mode which is just very small.

Then press Cntl-Alt-Del and hold them down while you press Enter.  (This might also works for XP).  If it works, look at options, and uncheck minimize on use.

Por otra aparte tu en tu país necesitas de un dise?ador Web para que te crea la pagina o si lo prefieras hacerlo tu mismo a tu gusto o necesidad, el lenguajes para dise?ar paginas web es HTML pero con la tecnología ya existe programas de calidad como flash de macromedia o java entre muchos otros, para mantener tu pagina en línea necesitas un servidor o sea una compradora pesada como normalmente se le conoce. Este deberá estar todo el tiempo encendido para que los usuarios que entren a tu página no tengan problemas. Los derechos se maneja por las terminaciones ninguna pagina puede tener el mismo nombre ni la misma extensión pero si el mismo nombre con diferente extensión te explico mejor:<br>  <br>  La extensión  .com. net. edu. etc. o sea que si el nombre de tu empresa es hola pero en línea ya existe un www.hola.com  tu podrías poner  www.hola.com.mx es el mismo nombre pero diferente extensión de hecho se recomienda que tenga esta extensión (com. mx o el respectivo a tu país puede ser com.ar de Argentina o br brasil así sucesivamente) porque evita tener conflictos con otras paginas  es mas fácil para nick reconocer la existencia de un www.hola.con.mx en México que buscar un www.hola.com en el mundo, también si tu pagina es de educación debe ser .com.edu, o si es un organismo deberá ser .gob , las tarifas irán acorde a la extensión ejemplo: la com.edu es la mas barata porque es con relación a la educación la mas cara es com. si me explico espero haber aclarado un poco tu duda.

Since a string can contain any amount of text, if a string is empty, it contains no text.<br>  <br>  This is exactly the same as an array variable that contains zero elements.<br>  <br>  As to *why* you would ever want a string variable to be empty, there are lots of reasons - for example you would want to set it to empty to be sure it doesn't contain garbage before you start adding text to it, or maybe a previous function has assigned it, and you want to see if it is empty to find out if the function did anything, etc...|`|wkLTTr06aa	Hello,<br>  When you assign a value of " " to a string essentually you are "emptying" that string awaiting a subsequent input.<br>  It's good practice to empty all strings at the beginning of a program.<br>  Also sometimes you want to input a new string value so you want to be sure the string is empty.<br>  It also assigns a value of "0" so you can use boolean code ie "not=true". <br>  Hope this helps a little.<br>  Al|`|696ef6ca84fa9734c2fd200c2761fbe4aa	Actually, you want to do that so that a storage location is assigned, otherwise a reference to that string name will give a nullpointer error.<br>  <br>  Saying <br>  String str;<br>  <br>  just defines a variable name but does NOT assign that variable an address.  Setting the str to any value, including an emply string, will assign an address to the variable.|`|JGBhN6FUaa	Normally String variables are not exactly a "standard" data type although most languages allow you to use them like one. A String is really an object and your variable is simply a pointer to that object. If you do not initialize your variable then you will get a null pointer exception when you attempt to reference it.<br>  <br>  So basically its useful to initialize strings to avoid errors.|`|jiakNb3Haa	i would assign <br>  string Word = "";<br>  to clear the string <br>   <br>  also, if i want to check if another string is empty by comparing the string to the empty one

lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

Most DVD drives come bundled with burning and movie software such as Nero burning rom, Cyberlink, Intervideo, etc. Since your movies arent showing up its likely you are missing the software that can play movies. These programs assign associations to the files attributed to DVD movies (.VOB files). I'd grab a DVD movie player program.

0xp9Oobnaa	PC is more of an open network that you can do anything you want, which you can choose what to do, by building a computer or buying (choosing). Also the hardware is more advanced than Apple, the software is safe and gives you more choices what you want to do with your PC.<br>  <br>  Apple is the opposite of an PC, they make you choose what they have. Their hardware is not advanced like an PC where you can build one or choose what you want on it. Their software is great and safe to use. they are also limited to have access to your computer.<br>  <br>  Overall it depends what are you going to be using for and how you use your computer. If you are just to check e-mails and doing schooling then go for a Apple/Mac, do not get their desktops. Get their notebooks. If you are going for a high-end computer get a PC.|`|AA12274045	its all about what and need.<br>  <br>  One needs not of them.

Apple doesn't have a full coverage warranty, but if you get a dell you can buy it and if anything happens to it they will replace it. Also having a pc you will be able to find software easier for what you want. If you become skilled enough you will also be able to work on them your self and the parts are much cheaper.

ElvQTpUVaa	By PCI, they most likely meant PCI-express.  That and AGP refer to the type of data bus on your mobo that accepts the card.  The bus type is very critical because an inefficent bus (elderly design) can nullify performance gains of other parts of the pc or the card.<br>  <br>  For PC's of the late 1990's and early 21st century, the standard was AGP, but this was supplanted by PCI-express.  You need to look at your PC's specific info, though I saw one being auctioned on eBay that had a PCIe slot, so you should be okay.<br>  <br>  Hardware-wise, performance, in theory, will vary depending on the app - the newest iteration of MS Flight Sim makes good use of quad-core CPU's, but many other programs run just as well on dual-core systems.  This may just come down to an issue of how much performance are you willing to pay for.  <br>  <br>  If you had a specific game in mind, I'd check with tomshardware.com, which uses programs that measure how well different cards will run a given game.
5VQrGtIIaa	Simply stated you can not upgrade to 64bit without upgrading the entire computer.  64 bit only referes to the processor and how it handles and transmits information.  To upgrade you are basically making a new computer.  You will need a new motherboard that is socketed for a 64bit processor, the processor itself and probably new ram if your current computer is more than a year old.  Also you may need a new hard drive as newer boards may not be able to handle a IDE drive.

DtSZhG9raa	Sure, by all means, if you like the model, and are prepared to pay the price.<br>  <br>  I suppose the 'look good' factor will play a big part when purchasing something that you will use everyday, so perhaps a little/lot more hard earned cash will be justified.<br>  <br>  Having said that though, I don't believe in 'style over substance', which can possibly be applied to Apple merchandise (especially their computers, but that's changing with their stuff shipping with Windows installed as well), and fashion labels in general. Design of the laptop should be considered carefully too, like whether or not it would suit your working/home environment and style. For example, the number of USB ports seems to be of continuing importance. One of my pet peeves is I don't like it when the function (Fn) key is in the corner of the keyboard. Out of habit this is inconvenient and annoying, much like Apple's funky keys that just have to be different than the standard key board.<br>  <br>  I personally don't like Sony that much, mainly due to fact that it *is* more expensive than other brands. It's probably safe to say all the extra you pay for the just Sony and Vaio label, and some design work.<br>  <br>  I would recommend looking into Asus and Acer products if you haven't already set your heart on a Sony. And I wouldn't really buy something like a laptop online; best to go to an actual (chain) store so they can power it up and show that it works upon purchase, and also better for servicing if problems arise within warrantee.<br>  <br>  Well, that's my long winded babble... I don't know why I'm blabbing so much whilst I should be preparing for my finals exams.|`|d3d6b63f58271c7d93c424ee1f70bfdfaa	waste of money... vaio's in my opinion are not that great|`|474611e5e9d3f09380293aff2c231fa7aa	What are you going to use it for, have a good think about it first. For ￡1000 you can get a really good laptop which will be perfect for music, photos school college or Uni work, in fact just about anything. The only reason to spend that much on a laptop is for gaming or processor intensive work such as video processing. OK so it's pretty but just think how many pairs of shoes and dresses you could buy with the ￡900 quid you save. However if it's what you really want it's up to you.|`|om1MqQXuaa	Vaio notebooks are expensive for what you get. There are many other companies that will offer a lot more computer for a lot less money. I just purchased a notebook for $2,300. This thing is a monster! 2.0 duo core extreme, GeForce 7950 GTX PCIe, 2 gbyt ram, 17" high res screen, Vista ultimate 64-bit. This computer has everything I need for a good price. Check out Sager Notebooks, I am very impressed with this computer and the company !

It aims at being very standards compliant.<br>  <br>  Opera usally the first with new features, and has email built into the browser. It is also available on many platforms, such as PC and cell phones, and will even be available on the Nintendo DS.<br>  <br>  Opera is free for PCs and Macs, and some other platforms, but may cost money for other platforms.<br>  <br>  Firefox is free, and you can get the source code to the browser, meaning you can make any changes you want. It also aims to be very standards compliant.<br>  <br>  To match some of the functionality of Opera, you need to install extensions to Firefox, and Firefox does not include email.  This however makes Firefox less cluttered and simpler. With extensions you can get more functionality than Opera.<br>  <br>  Firefox is based off of the Mozilla Suite, which was based off of Netscape, which was codenamed Mozilla.|`|16e5fd7730a97c9f85ee890bb74f388caa	I just downloaded opera not long ago...I still like firefox better.

Firefox to me is for sure one of the better, if not the best, browsers out there. Everybody should try it.<br>  <br>  Also, it has a cool name.

You have to get it in my computer first. Unplug it then replug it in, you should hear the tones from the computer signaling that it was disconnected and reconnected. If you do not hear these tones, check the battery in the player. If the battery is good, then try a different USB port. If this doesn't work, then check the USB cable. Once you hear the tones signaling insertion of a USB device, go into your My Computer, if the device is not there and this is possible, then right click the My Computer Icon and click manage, then look for drive management and look there for the device and be sure Windows is assigning it a drive letter. If the device is NOT here, then it is not working properly.<br>  <br>  Also, this is only to get the device to show as a removable drive. To get the device in there as a MP3 Player, you could try installing the devices drivers, though that isnt necessary for operation as it should be usable as a USB flash drive.

aae272cfb22671fa588bd9295208aa4eaa	I think you have all of the languages sewn up pretty well for designing. Of course, you need to remember that "designing" is not the same as "developing" even though most people tend to confuse them. "Designers" make the website look good. "Developers" make the website work right. But, I digress...<br>  <br>  The best way to start building up your portfolio is to build yourself a website that showcases your talents, register a domain name, and post it. Make yourself some business cards (use the good paper), post some ads in the free ads places, and keep at it. If you have a friend with a business that needs a website to look better, offer to do one for them for free. Mind you, don't make a habit out of offering free work. Make sure that that friend knows that this is free because they are helping you to get started. Always keep a portfolio of your work, even resorting to printing the pages or saving them in to PDF if the website changes in later years. As a developer, I look for designers that have been around a while (it shows stability and a marketable product) so that portfolio stretching back several years is valuable.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|1affbd5acf35c97e1472cfb53768da37aa	Hello<br>  The answer of Michael is good.

76b1dbaa7c929bfa245672d2cdc5a1bbaa	I wouldn't recommend a Dell M1210. The 7400go is aging and chugs on a lot of the newer games. The best gaming laptops come out of Sager www.pctorque.com <br>  <br>  Dell's XPS 1710 is over inflated in price, you can get the samething on a Sager. Asus also makes good gaming laptops in a 14 inch model. Most gamers want 17 inch screens but they are a pain to carry around so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  I do agree the E1705 model is a good bang for the buck if you buy it off Dell's outlet. My friend picked up one with 2 gigs of ram, core duo, 160 hard drive and Nvidia 7900GS 256 MB ram for under 1200.<br>  <br>  The Sagers you can get with up to 512 mb of Video ram so it really depends on what your budget is which is right for you.<br>  <br>  Find one your interested in and go here. <a href="http://www.notebookforums.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookforums.com/</a><br>  <br>  These boards are full of Laptop gamers so more then likely the model your interested in is covered and you can here reviews of that model you want.<br>  <br>  Good Luck..|`|eJmSQ0utaa	id say go for the inspiron e1705 or e1505 both of them are really good laptops and u can get a 256 geforce video card with them. the E1705 has a 17" screen if u want it for gaming 17" screen is good. <br>  the e1505 has a 15.4" screen thats not too bad either and best of all both of them have dual core processors so works excellent for games and vista.....smooth running. <br>  Cost effective too<br>  go to <a href="http://www.dell.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com</a> <br>  hope i helped :)|`|x4EAScDUaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Any multimedia  laptop with  core 2 duo + graphic card.

0PZhB5wSaa	This may sound dumb, but your CONTROL key may be stuck. CTRL+W closes most programs so if the control key is stuck and you type W, it will close the window. You can test my theory by pressing only the W key and seeing if whatever program closes.<br>  <br>  If this is the problem, it may be Sticky Keys or you need a new keyboard. To disable Sticky Keys (Windows program that holds Control key for disabled users), go to Control Panel -> Accessibility Options then under keyboard tab uncheck Sticky Keys.<br>  <br>  If Sticky keys is not the problem, try hitting your control keys, shift keys and alt keys kinda hard a few times to see if this does it.
