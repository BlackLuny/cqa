Reynolds numbers frequently arise when performing dimensional analysis of fluid dynamics and heat transfer problems, and as such can be used to determine dynamic similitude between different experimental cases. They are also used to characterize different flow regimes, such as laminar or turbulent flow: laminar flow occurs at low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces are dominant, and is characterized by smooth, constant fluid motion, while turbulent flow occurs at high Reynolds numbers and is dominated by inertial forces, which tend to produce random eddies, vortices and other flow fluctuations.  Flow in Pipe    For flow in a pipe or tube, the Reynolds number is generally defined as   Re=pVD/u=VD/v=QD/vA       where:     is the mean fluid velocity in (SI units: m/s)   D is the diameter (m)    is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pas or Ns/m2)    is the kinematic viscosity ( =  / ) (m2/s)    is the density of the fluid (kg/m3)   Q is the volumetric flow rate (m3/s)   A is the pipe cross-sectional area (m2)   Definitions in non-SI units usually have a number (coefficient) in front, for example 124, where the pipe diameter is in inches, the velocity in feet per second, the fluid density in pounds per cubic foot, and the viscosity in centipoise, which are traditional USA and UK units.[4]
Jqg4hQyHaa	This is the best explanation I have:    The soup was probably closer to boiling than you thought ~200F.  The whole system was in equilibrium.  The vapor from the soup condensed on the lid and the lid was quite hot.  But the droplets on the lid were all in equilibrium so they didn't change much.    When you moved the lid to the countertop, you lost all of the vapor under the lid.  This means the droplets, which were quite hot, saw much less water vapor in the air.  They simply evaporated very quickly.  They also had the very hot lid to keep them at their high temperature.  Also if the drops slid across the lids surface, they would increase their evaporation.    Bet the outside temperature was quite low so there was very little humidity in the inside air.    ********  Add MDGreg's answer, below, to mine, and I think you have a winner.|`|Sw0u2RD7aa	It might be because by trapping air out of the lid when you set it down it changed the air pressure.

Basic equation:  D = V * t    Known:  Dx = 75.0 m   Dy = 53.0 m  Vx = 1.10 m/s    Unknown  Vy (the river speed)    First I solve for time by using only the horizontal components:  t = Dx/Vx = 75/1.1 = 68.2 s    Then I this time to solve for Vy (the river speed)    Vy = Dy/t = 53 m/ 68.2 s = .777 m/s    The river speed is 0.777 m/s    Her speed relative to the shore is 1.10 m/s (this is because the shore is a line and not a point).  I have a feeling that they want you to calculate her speed relative to the point she left.  This would be:  V = sqrt (Vy^2 + Vx^2) = sqrt (1.1^2 + 0.777^2) = 1.35 m/s    The angle she needs to swim at is solved by:  We know her velocity relative to the water is 1.10 meters.  This is the hypotenuse of the triangle of speeds.  We know the river speed is 0.777 m/s.  This is the opposite side of the triangle.  Use Sin (theta) = opposite/hypotenuse:  Sin (theta) = 0.777/1.1  theta = 45.0 degrees    She needs to swim at 45.0 degrees.

The Dover judge showed just how deperate they are to "make " creationism a science..by placing the same old pig in a tuxedo and calling it a penguin....the judge and other enlightened people see through that ruse right away. Evolution does not address how life began but the convergent evidence totally supports that once it did begin evolution was it the way it progressed. I am not overly surprised that many people believethe creation story..that is all they ever heard  their belief engines are wide open.and the wider open that belief engine is,the more closed the mind.   The mysterious thumbs down guy may strike again..and I care not .Factsare facts ..whether they depress him or not|`|ojHFFpcBaa	You misunderstand how evolution works. First of all , we didn't come from monkeys. Monkeys and humans have a common ancestor.    Second, this common ancestor was found in different areas of Africa, perhaps even outside Africa. The animals in different areas had different food, different predators attacking them, different environments for defense, etc.    Over time, as they adjusted to the food, the predators, the environment, each group began to less and less resemble the earlier creature and to even not resemble groups in other remote areas.    Pretty soon you had a population that was different enough in one place to be called a separate species from animals in another locale. This went on over and over again, until today.|`|ifwgd5dMaa	Sometimes this question is asked snidely by anti-science individuals. I also think that it is a valid question by people who do not know enough about evolutionary theory. This answer will address the latter possibility.    Evolution is the shifting of a population's traits, making them more adapted to their environment. The causality, though, is lost in this statement. Actually, individuals vary. Right? You're different from your sister, from your friends, from everyone. In a natural environment, some individuals would be more able to survive and produce offspring. Individuals with genes that are less well adapted will die (starvation, predation, disease, etc) and not pass their genes on to the next generation. Environmental pressures (natural selection) affect which traits will become more common in the next generation, because individuals with beneficial traits will have more offspring.    That being said, each species can have different populations, different groups, in slightly different environments. Different environments, with different pressures, will result in different traits evolving. That's why there are also 270 different species of monkey. Some of them have evolved prehensile (gripping) tails, some eat sap from trees (most don't), some walk around on the ground a lot (langurs in India), and some never touch the ground.    In the case of human evolution, apes branched off from proto-monkeys around 25-30 million years ago and there were hundreds of different types of apes at one time (modern apes are orangutans, gorillas, gibbons, chimpanzees, and bonobos). At 23 million years ago, there were MORE species apes than monkeys! Most of these died off about 8-10 million years ago, and the modern genera were left. The human lineage diverged from other great apes about 5-7 million years ago, and there have been a couple dozen species on our branch of the evolutionary tree since then. One species two million years ago had incredibly large molars, walked upright, and lived on the African serengheti, and could eat rougher food than modern humans can ingest. Neanderthals, only 250,000 years ago, were very similar to modern humans, had some culture, and lived mostly in Europe and western Asia. Modern humans evolved in Eastern Africa and spread through the rest of the world relatively quickly.    Some population of monkeys developed apelike traits, but their cousins in the next forest over didn't. Some apes developed humanlike traits, but their cousins in the next forest didn't. Some human ancestors developed humanlike traits, but their cousins 100 miles away didn't, and ended up dying out. Modern humans continue to evolve. Our molars are getting smaller and smaller!|`|AA11513203	Because of *branching*.    If you don't understand how species *branch*, you can't understand evolution.  This is what biologists called 'speciation' ... the branching of a species into multiple species.    Here's how branching works.    If a species (like a long-extinct primate) gets split into isolated sub-populations (e.g. climate change isolates them into separate forests), then the two populations will continue to evolve (change genetically), but in different ways (because they are not interbreeding, they cannot exchange genetics).   With enough time, the two branches become genetically incompatible ... they cannot cross-breed even if they come in contact with each other ... they have become separate *species*, and they can never again recover the ability to cross-breed (become a single species again).    So this early primate ancestor *branched* into two species ... and one went on to branch again, and again, and become the modern apes (including humans), and the other went on to branch and branch again to become the modern monkeys (there are 78 species of monkeys in that branch, called the Old World monkeys).    So why don't they ALL become human?  Because evolution does not mean "becoming more like humans".   It just means "change."    All those primate branches are no more likely to ALL evolve towards "humanhood" than they are to ALL evolve towards "chimphood" or "baboonhood."  Different environments produce different adaptations ... but even *identical* environments can produce completely different adaptations.      Thus it doesn't make sense to ask why there are "still monkeys" ... the monkeys that are "still here" are not our ancestors.   No modern species is the ancestor of another modern species (that would make no sense).         Branching, branching, branching.   That's your answer.    ----    P.S. Somebody just went through and added a thumbs down to the first three answers.   It is so pathetically lame to just thumb down people because they dared to actually *answer* a question that they thought was a real "stumper" for the evolutionists.   If that was you, asker, that would be doubly lame to thumb down people for **answering your question** ... and you should just say so, so that other people don't waste their time answering a question you really don't care about.

They became modern monkeys, both old world and new world, though oddly the new world monkey's branched off from our line of decent before the old world.    Ask yourself the same question about any species of kingdom.  Why, for instance are there still fish?  The answer becomes obvious, because there is a way of life to exploit that allows the organism to reproduce and have descendants.  Evolution isn't progressive, leading to better things, it just allows for exploitation of niches.    The mistake you're making is thinking that humans are better than monkeys.  Why do you think that, other than being a human?  Do you think you'd survive for long in the rain forest compared with a monkey?|`|He5XWnJtaa	Speciation depends on the divergence of certain genetic populations of a species to the point where they cease to remain the same species. There is nothing necessarily involved in speciation that would preclude the continued existence of the original species. There 4 major reasons speciation would occur. One of the most straightforward to understand is the scenario where two species are separated geographically and thus cannot exchange new (beneficial) mutations.    Furthermore, monkeys did not evolve into humans. Humans and modern-day monkeys share a common ancestor at some point in the past, whose descendants split into various species.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	You've raised a good point.  How about this to consider regarding branching, with all the years evolution has been considered and the huge number of animal species, is there a species which has clearly branched into two distinct species during this time?  And how come humans don't ever branch into two distinct species?  We've got records of all sorts of things for 2000 years or more, but no apparent branching.

Personally I was a math major and I got by just fine using a simple $12 Radio Shack scientific calculator, not a graphing one.  But graphing calculators certainly have some benefits, and some classes (not all, but some) in some schools try basing exercises around graphing calculators, so if you're going to be taking more than one math or science class I'd say it's work the investment.    I'd say just buy the cheapest TI graphing calculator you can.  You really don't need to spend tons more for all of these extra features that you'll never use.

We simply don't know, having never encountered any other forms of life other than that from Earth.    However, it is probably highly likely that there are other forms of life that depend on other elements, perhaps toxic to us. Silicon has some similar properties to carbon, and is quite abundant in the universe. Thus, there might be a lot of silicon-based life out there (perhaps the models use 'carbon implants' to enhance their figure...) or life made of even more exotic elements.|`|4FFJNNjnaa	"If one believes in religions (any) he knows ..."  What?  If you believe, then you know?  How does one jump to that confusion?    Never mind.  Back to your question. I think you are asking "If there is a non-carbon based life form, could science recognize it as a life form?"   First, science can do nothing one way or the other.  People, behaving scientifically, can do anything.  So, yes, if we encounter a life form that isn't carbon based, I am sure that we would proceed to examine it, using scientific methods, and determine that it is a life form.|`|a9ce5ed86b53a6e557c71eb194706402aa	not at the moment. the reason we say carbon based is because carbon is the only element able to form long complex chains with rings, double, and triple bonds. its is because of its distribution of electrons and size. Silicon is similar but much bigger so its harder to form triple bonds and even double bonds and hard to form rings. Really any life based on anything of carbon or silicon would be incredibly different than anything we could imagine, basically it would have to be very very simple because complex things like DNA, membranes, amino acids, proteins could not be formed.    Edit* also the thing about archea being bacteria with a different evolutionary pathway is rubbish, archea is a domain of life that evolved around the same time as eukarya and shares the common ancestor which is bacteria. archea evolved FROM bacteria as we understand it. archea are different from bacteria in the composition of their cell wall and dna (include introns and histone protiens)|`|0xnv5waeaa	no or not yet but some scientist say there might be silicon based life form in the universe try googleing it but it has not been proven to be possible try googleing drake equation|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	The cold hard true answer, the only one that can be given with any degree of certainty, is that we simply do not know. There may very well be an abundance of life in the universe, both carbon or not. There may only be carbon lifeforms, and we may be the only carbon life forms. It is also entirely possible that planetary conditions which are necessarily for the rise of life are so unbelievably unlikely that the Earth is the only life-sustaining planet in the universe.     Some have proposed Silicon. Silicon-based lifeforms is possible, but we must consider that there is vastly more silicon on Earth than there is carbon, but only carbon based life forms flowered rapidly as soon as conditions on Earth permitted it.     Some scientists even believe that because we only have a single example of life, then other forms of life may be so dramatically different that we fail to even recognize them as life. There could be lifeforms entirely made of atomic nuclei or electrons. Steven Baxter even envisioned life inside neutron stars, where the gravity is so intense that anything which would fall onto the star would be smashed into its constituent particles, and is the greatest amount of gravity conventional matter can sustain before collapsing into a black hole.     So far, the closest thing to non-earth based lifeforms that we have is archaea, which is bacteria which has separate evolutionary pathways from conventional bacteria. The first Archaea were detected inside of hot springs, where it was assumed that the heat made it inhospitable for life to dwell. Such lifeforms help us to open our eyes to other possibilities, but for the moment, it is all speculation.    EDIT -- thanks for clearing that up, sexaliciouslatina. I knew that Archaea were different from bacteria, but my wording is off. I know calling them bacteria is like calling humans monkeys. Still, my point remains; they are the closest things to alien life that we can study, due to their differences|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Yes.  It might not recognize it for what it is very quickly but if it complies with the accepted definition of life eventually someone will see it for what it is.  SPotting carbon based life that is living at a rate similar to ours will be relatively easy.  But what if we come across something that lives reproduces and dies  in a fraction of a second and does this on a molecular scale?  We would tend to assume it was some sort of mineral in special circumstances.  Or something that takes thousands of year to reproduce, growing very slowly out of a nearly rigid silica based form?  (Some people have vaguely worked out some of the basic silica based life forms- all very speculative but not intrinsically impossible).    For almost 200 years people failed to recognize that the coloring of the hot springs in Yellowstone was the result of living organisms and not just chemical solutions and compounds.  And the are carbon based.  But people eventually did.    So I expect people will recognize other life forms too, maybe just not quite as quickly.

xopIi2Vfaa	generally you won't earn much in biology, particularly not in an university setting, the starting salary as a professor is about 50-60k. That's after 4 years of bachelor, 4-7 years of PhD and 2-5 years of postdoc work.   I don't know what the salaries in industry are, they generally are clearly higher.   If you can get enthusiastic about botany, you will never have to deal with lab animals after your undergraduate degree. Or if you chose your field carefully, you may not have to damage an animal. Also consider if you mind, e.g. working with nematodes and doing research which involves killing them at times or if you just love vertebrates, so if it doesn't have fur and doesn't look cute you are not bothered that much.     Generally you won't be able to earn much and get jobs much beyond a lab technician with just a bachelor degree. You should use the time as an undergrad to figure out what you want to do afterwards.

Then wind the string up, keeping it always taut. The locus of points traced out by the end of the string is called the involute of the original curve, and the original curve is called the evolute of its involute. This process is illustrated above for a circle.     Although a curve has a unique evolute, it has infinitely many involutes corresponding to different choices of initial point.

WkWedRnoaa	If you go by what you see in the sky with the naked eye, Mercury has a yellowish tint and is rarely seen in a totally dark sky.  Venus appears to be white as does Jupiter.  Saturn has a yellowish tint, Mars usually has a reddish tint, more apparent at some times than at others.  Neptune and Uranus are generally invisible to the naked eye, except that Uranus is visible if you know where to look under dark skies.  In that case it appears to be greenish/white to white, depending upon the darkness of the skies.  In a small telescope, showing both Uranus and Neptune as starlike or as very small spheres, Uranus appears greenish and Neptune looks bluish.    In larger telescopes and in closeups taken by passing or orbiting satellites, each planet shows multiple "colors" depending upon the gasses or rocks visible and the topography of the surface, where it is visible.     When seen in closeups, Jupiter has many colors, none of which is dominant.  Because of that and Jupiter's huge diameter, the light reflected from Jupiter tends to blend into a "white" light.  Venus looks white because of its generally "white" cloud cover.  Mars looks "reddish" because most of the surface of Mars reflects yellow and red wavelengths of light, with reds being dominant. Saturn, Uranus and Neptune have the same explanation.  Though each is multicolored, the colors we see tend to be the yellows of Saturn, the blues of Neptune and the greens of Uranus.    In addition, different people, looking at the same thing, may see different "colors", depending upon their visual acuity, the size of what they're seeing, the brightness of the object, and the contrast with the background in which the object is seen.  See the wiki article attached for a broader explanation.
9fdb8309a82d0fd5cf22e900d46f7662aa	Yes, as the temperature increases, substances such as salt will dissolve more in water.|`|ViKjojK0aa	Yes. The more water is heated, the more the molecules spread apart. Heated enough, the molecules will leave the liquid in a state of steam because of how far spaced they are. When the molecules are more spaced apart, the salt can creep into the crevices between the molecules. So, temperature certainly affects the amount of material that can dissolve in water.
8Y7LQ6TGaa	you are correct.    As HP goes up, you need to use higher voltages, or else the wire requirement would call for wire too thick to be usable for winding the motor.    Bigger motors need more power, so you would need a lot of batteries anyway, either in series or parallel, and the series connection is more efficient.     But remember, not all motors are designed to run on DC batteries.    And, note that a lot of motors are designed to operate on multiphase AC,  which results in a very efficient motor, and multiphase AC at 480 volts is available in most factories.     .|`|wJTsifugaa	Sure, you can add the voltages if the batteries are connected in series.    Most plants that I have seen use AC power for their major motors, using a battery is a less efficient and more costly way to run equipment.  They are used for critical systems, where you want to guard against the effects of losing A/C power that only comes from outside.  The DC motors I have seen are used for a back up pumps that send lubricating oil to a turbine, so it can cost down to a stop without damaging the bearings.  Other can drive motors for critical valves that have to operate to supply water to prevent overheating, such as in nuclear power plants.  These motors will be fed from banks of batteries that operate at 125v or 250V because the batteries supply power even if the normal sources are unavailable.

154146d98d9dbb211223b05af3f8c0d5aa	Per your example 99.5 would be the lowest number rounded to 100 with two sig figs,, and 104.999 is approximately the largest number that would round down to 100 with two sig figs.  99.5 x 99.5 = 9900.25  104.999 x 104.999 = 11024.790001  This range means that two significant figures is accurate to ALMOST two significant figures when squared.  When adding, the level of inaccuracy is determined by the number of addends.  Using the same logic, 99.5 + 99.5 = is accurate to two sig figs and 99.5 x anything less than 1000  still rounds up to the same two sig figs. So adding addends of the nearly the same size, sig figs are reliable until the addition gets ridiculous.

PUUXbVK2aa	What causes lightning?  Lightning is an electric current. Within a thundercloud way up in the sky, many small bits of ice (frozen raindrops) bump into each other as they move around in the air. All of those collisions create an electric charge. After a while, the whole cloud fills up with electrical charges. The positive charges or protons form at the top of the cloud and the negative charges or electrons form at the bottom of the cloud. Since opposites attract, that causes a positive charge to build up on the ground beneath the cloud. The grounds electrical charge concentrates around anything that sticks up, such as mountains, people, or single trees. The charge coming up from these points eventually connects with a charge reaching down from the clouds and - zap - lightning strikes!|`|pI9PWc8uaa	yes its all related.

Elements 90-103 are called lanthanides:  False, because elements 90-103 are called Actinides. Elements 58-71 are called Lanthanides.    Potassium has a high first ionization energy but a low second ionization energy.  False, because little energy is needed to remove potassium's first valence electron.    Transition elements are found in groups 13-15:  False, because transition elements, or transition metals, are found respectively in groups 3-12.    Elements lose electrons to form a negative ion:  False, because if elements lose their negatively charged electrons, there will be an overall positive charge remaining.|`|ossCVxPqaa	If you want to ask a question, do so and you will get an answer.

Some viruses have a DNA genome, like HSV or influenza.  When you're asked to chose if a virus is "RNA or DNA", you're being asked which nucleic acid makes up their genome.    The only practical way to tell the differences is to study the text or notes in your biology class and memorize the properties and life cycles of these viruses.|`|z7BiMSWmaa	There is a whole range of different viruses (not cellular and so are not prokaryotes) some have single stranded RNA,some double stranded RNA,some single stranded DNA and some double stranded DNA.    Very briefly:-    DNA contains deoxyribose, RNA contains ribose, (there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the 2' position in DNA). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to hydrolysis.  The complementary base to adenine is not thymine, as it is in DNA, but rather uracil, which is an unmethylated form of thymine

Within a particular area, as few as one, and generally no more than two or three species of eucalypt will be regularly browsed while a variety of other species, including some non-eucalypts, appear to be browsed occasionally or used for just sitting or sleeping in.     Different species of eucalypts grow in different parts of Australia, so a koala in Victoria would have a very different diet from one in Queensland. Koalas like a change, too, and sometimes they will eat from other trees such as wattle or tea tree.

The larger is positive, so the answer is positive  Q4 is -1, since it is also a difference, with the larger number negative   Q5 -5/6 : both are negative, so just add and keep the negative  Q6 1/12 : a difference of signs means a difference. Larger positive, so positive answer  Q7 Two negatives makes this (-3) + 8 : so it is now a difference of 5 with the larger positive -- answer 5  Q8  answer 2 : difference  Q9 answer -16 : sum  Q10 answer 11 : double negative makes this a sum of positives  Q11 answer -1/6 : double negative makes this a difference, with larger number negative  Q12 answer -7/12 : sum of negatives  Q13 answer -12 : Negative times positive is negative  Q14 answer -2 : same as above  Q15 answer 54 : negative times negative is positive  Q16 answer 30 : above with another positive stays positive  Q17 answer -4 : negative divided by positive (or positive divided by negative) is negative  Q18 answer 4 : but negative divided by negative is positive    To clarify  the above :  Same sign divided is always positive  Different sign divided is always negative    Q19 answer -2 : different signs is negative  Q20 answer -2/3 : different signs is negative.

You can always multiply by 1 without changing a value. Since 3 ft = 1 yd, [3 ft/1 yd] = 1    So if I wanted the speed of light in furlongs per fortnight, I would go about it so:  186,000 miles/second x [3600 second/hr] x [24 hr/day] x [14 day / fortnight] x [8 furlongs/mile] =   186,000 x 3600 x 24 x 14 x 8 furlongs/fortnight|`|0zQw2K71aa	17/3=5.666

12bOrqEfaa	the answer is;higher the temperature.thermodynamic controll.|`|YZAMZFKeaa	My guess is that the answer is d. lower temperature, thermodynamic control. The reason is because only the most stable molecule is forming, that being 1,6-dibromo-2,4-hexadiene. Bromination at one of the terminal olefins is the first step in the reaction.    CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH2 + Br2 --> BrCH2-CH(+)-CH=CH-CH=CH2    Isomerization of the double bonds moves the cation to the terminal carbon (the C6 carbon)...    BrCH2-CH(+)-CH=CH-CH=CH2  BrCH2-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2(+)    Finally, Br- adds to the C6 carbon...    BrCH2-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2(+) + Br- --> BrCH2-CH=CH-CH=CH-CH2-Br    The reason why I think the reaction is at low temperature is because bromination of the first carbocation did not occur. Instead, the intermediate isomerized to form the more stable 1,6-dibromide product. As a general rule, thermodynamic products are obtained at lower temperatures and kinetic products are formed at higher temperatures...    Hope this helps!!!
b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	For this reaction to occur, the dinitrile compound must first change conformation from the E- isomer to the Z-isomer, in which both -CN groups are on the same side of the C=C bond. What follows is the typical Diels-Alder reaction. Form a six-membered ring from the three C=C bonds. The original C=C bonds disappear and a new C=C bond forms between the two inner C atoms of the C=C-C=C system.
b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	This is a Diels-Alder reaction. The compound with the two conjugated double bonds is called the "diene". The other compound with one double bond is called the "dienophile". To draw the skeletal structure in any D-A reaction, join one end of the conjugated diene double bonds to one end of the dienophile double bond, then join the other ends together to form a six-membered ring. The D-A reaction always forms a six-membered ring from the two double bonds of the diene and the one double bond of the dienophile. To complete the skeletal structure all three of the original double bonds disappear and a new one is formed between the two inner C atoms of the diene system. This is difficult to show with just text, but you might get the idea from this if you remove the horizontal lines (except for the arrow):    //------------------------/\  |---+---||  -------->----||-|  \\------------------------\/

Cc2Yb9DKaa	Trees require a tremendous amount of water to thrive and reproduce.  Areas with plenty of rain or ground water induce the growth of forests.  In contrast, an area with too little rainfall to support trees provides excellent conditions for the growth of grasses and small shrubs.  That is why you see fewer trees in the Texas, Oklahoma and parts of Kansas, where the ground holds too little water for large trees to grow.
xopIi2Vfaa	chemical mimicry is a pretty wide term. It can be used e.g. by certain beetles or caterpillar to smell to an ant like a colony member and consequently not get attacked (look up inquilines of ants). There are also a number of flowers (e.g. check out carrion flowers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion_flo... ) and also fungi which smell of rotting meat and consequently attract carrion eating insects.   I am pretty sure it's not chemical mimicry which is restricted to orchids as there are also examples from animals.   Your link doesn't work for me, but I expect it's something more specific than general chemical mimicry.

TL1Jkqunaa	Kepler realized the sun and the orbits of the planets were tightly related..  He determined that the orbits are ellipses, and the shape of the ellipse and the speed of a planet were determined by the sun.  He seems to thought that a force emanated from the sun and pushed the planets along their orbital paths, kind of like a broom sweeping them along in their orbits.    Newton's amazing "intuition" was realizing that the sun does control the planets but rather than a force moving from the sun and pushing the planets  gravity, mutual attraction, would just as well fit the the orbits and speeds Kepler's calculations got.  ANd somehow Newton was able to see that this was the same gravity we see on earth, and with all bodies.

You can get a clue to this by looking at the "mass fractions" and adding them up. You will notice that the three fractions add up to 1.0. This tells you that the total mass of the solution (it would be a solution and not a mixture) is de only to these three compounds, otherwise they would add up to something less than 1.0.  You will notice that the mass fraction is also unitless. Density is measured in this case in kg/m^3, so  total density = sum of (mass fraction X density)  or (0.2 X 800) + (0.3 X 810) + (0.5 X 840) = 160 + 243 + 420 = 823 kg/m^3

Cc2Yb9DKaa	Thunderstorms are the dynamic interaction between two contrasting masses of air (usually a cold front encountering a warm front.)  The warm air interacts with the cold air, cause a change in pressure that drives wind and produces rain.  When a thunderstorm grows particularly intense, in the right conditions, it will begin to spin or rotate.  This rotation can lead to the formation of tornados.  Tornados typically happen over land, but some can occur over water, known as a waterspout.  Tornados have extremely high winds isolated over a relatively small area.  Tornado can produce the strongest winds of all three.    Hurricanes are collections of thunderstorms that organize into a larger meteorological event.  Hurricanes (in the Atlantic) and cyclones (in the Pacific) typically form over warm, tropical waters near the equator.  In both cases, several thunderstorms combine to form a rotating mass of clouds, winds, rains, and extreme changes in pressure.  Hurricanes usually form over water because several feet of warm, ocean water provides a constant source of energy to create the rotation and uplifting.  They usually dissipate over land because the ground cools off faster than deep warm water, taking the energy away from the storm.|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	The main difference between them is size.  A hurricane contains many thunderstorms, of which some of the thunderstorms could produce tornadoes.  Hurricane typically cause more damage overall simply because of their size, though a tornado can cause more extensive local damage due to typically stronger winds.

If everyone else applying to medical school has the same 3.8+ GPA and high MCATs that you do, working in a  biochem, pharmacology or medical research laboratory (of some sort)  will also put you in contact with doctors (PhDs or MDs) who might write letters of recommendation, steer you towards a particular school, or if you really work hard, add you as an author to a paper.
Gnfc4wRlaa	Here is the general description from Wikipedia.  There is a lot more info there and at the other site listed.  Just do a search for volcanoes and you'll find plenty of information for your paper.    "A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or crust, which allows hot, molten rock, ash, and gases to escape from below the surface. Volcanic activity involving the extrusion of rock tends to form mountains or features like mountains over a period of time.  Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging. A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by "divergent tectonic plates" pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by "convergent tectonic plates" coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust (called "non-hotspot intraplate volcanism"), such as in the African Rift Valley, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America and the European Rhine Graben with its Eifel volcanoes.  Volcanoes can be caused by "mantle plumes". These so-called "hotspots" , for example at Hawaii, can occur far from plate boundaries."|`|Ta9Ppkdnaa	Here's some free advice: don't write a research paper on Yahoo Answers. The whole point of these things is to do your own research. So I'm going to try to get you started, but check out some of my sources for more.    A volcano is essentially a hole in the Earth's crust. When a big pocket of high-pressure magma builds up under the planet's surface, eventually it breaks through and spews all over the place, eventually hardening into a volcano.|`|KUVRekuZaa	http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoe...    explore this site, does what it says on the tin, a good and comprehensive introduction

8cLV2OPYaa	It is really very simple, and pay no mind to the fools that are convinced that we will all die a horrible death without oil. Everything we need that we use oil to make, can be made using other methods, or using other materials entirely, INCLUDING fuel. Even if we INSISTED on using liquid fuel rather than the FAR superior hydrogen gas, we can make alcohol all day long without using a drop of oil. We could also use nitro-methane. ANY hydro-carbon would suffice, it doesn't NEED to come from oil.    We can use graphite as lubricant which works better anyways and comes from carbon not oil. We can use varieties of carbon fabric to make things that we would ordinarily use plastic for, and carbon fabric is non-toxic, lighter, stronger, and more durable to boot. The only reason why we even use oil at all is because we have the infrastructure for its use already installed and widespread world wide. Before oil we had no problem building and using huge machines to do our work for us. We were closer to the hydrogen economy during the times of the steam locomotive than we are now.    The only people that have a problem with reducing our dependence on oil, are those that stand to lose financially or politically from doing it. PERIOD. In a pinch, if ALL the diesel stations in the US were closed down tomorrow. It would take me maybe a week, maybe less, to completely convert my 96 Kenworth semi-truck over to burning hydrogen, with the only inconvenience being that I might have to top off the batteries charge every couple of days. Other vehicles would be even easier to convert, and some require no conversion at all.  So, running out of oil doesn't concern me in the slightest bit. Why? Because I have no stock whatsoever in the success or failure of ANY oil company, and I am not seeking election to public office from a bunch of people who want to keep getting rich selling oil, or that are too lazy to worry about what to switch to if oil went away.    In many ways, running out of oil would be the best thing that ever happened to us, because we would have no choice but to upgrade our infrastructure out of the stone age, and begin making use of the far superior technology that exists that currently people are too cheap or greedy to invest in now.    However, make no mistake. This may sound like a "left-wing" or "liberal" diatribe against "Big Oil". I assure you it is actually the opposite. I am a capitalist AND an Imperialist. Nothing would please me more than to see the United States leave everyone else in the world in the dust economically. If we converted everything to carbon and hydrogen, we would no longer need to rely on ANY nation in the world for ANY substance, product, service, or resource. We could manufacture items FAR cheaper than the rest of the "oil" burning world, and STILL be able to pay our workers more than anybody else.     The rest of the world would be literally "at our behest". While everyone else is paying 3 dollars a gallon or more for gasoline or diesel, OUR people would be paying very little or nothing for simple salt water. If I were allowed to run my truck for instance on hydrogen instead of being forced to use diesel fuel, my business would save 300 to 500 a week in fuel costs. That's up to 2000 dollars a month, or 24,000 dollars a year. Even if it cost me 10,000 dollars to convert my truck and an additional 50 cents a gallon to have access to specially treated "purified or optimized" saline solution for maximum electrolytic efficiency, I would still save a bundle of money every year, and the conversion would pay for itself in less than half a year.    I think I have made a good enough point here, but let me add one last thing. Every scientist in the US worth his salt, that isn't a complete twit, knows exactly what I am talking about here. None of this is magic, or conspiratorial, or "wacky". This is ALL common knowledge. Any first year college student in chemistry or physics knows full well how obsolete the use of refined oil for internal combustion engines is. For the love of Pete, even rotary engines like the ones that are in Mazdas run better on hydrogen than gasoline without even having to change or add a single component in the engines. A simple timing adjustment that could be done by an 18 year old kid that hasn't even finished a mechanic apprenticeship is all that's needed.    So please consider the fact that the vast majority of those that "cling" to the use of oil, are only doing it for the sake of greed or political popularity. Any TRUE capitalist or real "conservative" would jump on the opportunity to gain the long term economic and ultimately the political advantage of being independent of the need to rely on oil at all, from ANY source.|`|O9FojdEMaa	go back to walking.|`|Ykm3M9Piaa	we die i think.|`|RfGiuZ15aa	If the world runs out of oil without discovering a replacement for it, then we are in big trouble. We are not just talking about providing energy. Oil gives us far more than that. Oil products are used in the making of plastics, fertilizers and medicine in addition to fuels, lubricants and other things. No alternative to oil is so versatile. Imagine the things we take for granted which will not be able to be made if oil is gone. TVs, computers, car components - the list is endless.    Nuclear Fusion won't do it. Anyway, the world's uranium supplies are very small so long term, fusion is not an option unless research turns up alternatives there. Nothing else produces the vast amount of energy that oil does. Wind power is expensive not as good as solar power. Still, they help - only not enough by a long way.    I think we need to be doing a lot of research into alternatives to oil or else we will be living in a far less technologically advanced world in the future. We need to reduce our usage of oil and conserve what we have. This means people must be more responsible. From my research, Americans use far more energy than Europeans. For example, those huge gas guzzlers will have to go. We'll have to cut down on those long distance flights and budget airlines will disappear. I would see it affecting globalisation too. But I'm all for that. Why buy from China when the same product can be made at  home? I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg here. So I've put a few links below which you'll find interesting. Look at the Lifeaftertheoilcrash link to see just how much we depend on oil. There are lots of sites out there. Google peak oil and you'll see what I mean.    Feasible alternatives must be found. Recently, I came across a company called Black Light Power which claims to be able to produce electricity from the hydrogen atom for a fraction the cost of traditional methods. If this is true, it will vastly reduce our dependence on oil. So the price will drop dramatically. There will be far less demand for it although we will still need it.    However, the knock on effect of this is that the Middle East will no longer take centre stage in world affairs which means a more peaceful future for us all. So the demise of oil can't be all bad but it will be a very different world and we can't be complacent about it.

Anyone who claims it can't be done is an idiot.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	Disadvantages of cloning    In June 1998, president Clinton publicly condemned human cloning. He opined that any discovery that touches upon human creation is not simply a matter of scientific inquiry. It is a matter of morality and spirituality as well. Each human life is unique, born of a miracle that reaches beyond laboratory science. When did president Clinton condemn human cloning so resolutely? What are the reasons lurking behind actually? Let us start discussing the reasons of opposing cloning deeply.    The uncertainty of science technology    Science and technology cannot solve everything. What if we allow to human cloning? Have we ever thought of the results of that? Will the results be controllable? Even scientists cannot promise they can. Obviously, there are some potential crises lurking behind. Of course, these kinds of uncertainty are not reasonable to stop all the developments of science and technology. But we believer that we should ban such extreme cases (such as human cloning) as long as they have potential in damaging humans future.    Furthermore, in cloning Dolly, it resulted in the death of many embryos and newborns before success achieved. (The Dolly experiment started with 277 fused eggs, of which only 29 became embryos. All the embryos were transferred to 13 sheep. 1 became pregnant with Dolly.) In addition, even if the human clone survived, it is not guaranteed that it would develop normally. The genetic material in cloning Dolly came from a 6 year old mammal (what is an old stage of sheep). Dollys chromosomes could be found in older animals only. This finding made scientists start wondering whether Dolly, looking totally normal from its appearance, might have inherited genetic damage that would be shown in older age only or some other abnormalism.    Losing the diversity of genes    Human can live on the Earth relies on the diversity of genes. And the diversity of genes comes from parents having different sets of genes. The most horrendous part of identical genes is that it will weaken our power and adaptations, which make us subjected to great diseases easily. In addition, human cloning is just copying the identical genes, which means it will decrease the diversity of genes.    Furthermore, the beauty of humanity lies in the differences we see in each other. Cloning would eliminate surprise and predict expectancy.    The great diseases and leading to extinction    As mentioned above, in human cloning, all human beings will be identical. Which means that entire human is at a risk of getting infected by the same type of pathogen. In scientific point of view, if every one has the same type of genes and they are closed to each other they may not defend against the same kind of serious disease. Then cloning will be detrimental in terms of a great disaster.    Another negative effect of cloning is inbreeding, as everyone has the same genotype and keep reproducing among themselves. This would lead us to our own extinction finally.    Richard Nicholson of the British Bulletin of Medical Ethics said that cloning research may well be sowing the seeds of our own destruction.    Cloning is playing God    The clergymen opined human cloning is playing the role of god. Bishop of Catholic Albert Moraczewski mentioned that the power that God gives humans is over the fish, the birds, and all animals, domestic and wild, large and small. (Genesis, chapter1, verse 26). Adam and Eve have all the power, except they cannot eat the fruit of the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad. If they do so, they will die. So, Albert Moraczewski believes that human cloning is out of the Gods permission. There is no evidence that proves humans have the right to change Gods will.    Transgressing the nature    Human cloning transgresses nature, because it is not via the natural reproductive process, which is by a man and a woman. Human cloning is creating life.    Inhumane    A clone makes no differences as us. A clone must ear, drink and carry out any other metabolic processes in order to survive. The clone may even be better than his original host. It would be inhumane to treat them as special species. If human is cloned, this will turn us to be a property which can be sold to anybody else. In other words, selling humans is unethical, inhumane and immoral.      Devastate parenting and family life    The basic concept of a family is a couple falls in love and determines to care each other. Then the couple may decide to have children which they will love them dearly. But parents of clones might value their children according to how much they look like to themselves. Cloning, at a result, undermine the basic elements of loving, nurturing family and to accept each child as an unique individual.    Cause unbalance to the society    Cloning may arouses social side effects. It is ridiculous that reproduction is separated from love and other human relationship. The entire world may use clon|`|pRF5LLloaa	Sheep and dogs are alive.

What is the mol of water that can be held in gas phase at 100% humidity?    n = PV/RT = (4.6 torr)(0.75 L)/(62.3636 L torr/[deg K*mol])(273 + 0 K)   = 2.0264004e-4 mol    This means that (3.7937711e-4 - 2.0264004e-4 mol) = 0.00018 mol    Since there are 18.02 g H2O / mol H2O, then 0.0032 g = 3.2 mg of liquid should form.

The first one does not identify the location of the carbonyl function within the pentane skeleton. It is a ketone so the C=O function must be on the second, third, or fourth C atom in the pentane chain. Can't be on C-2 because of the propyl substituent, but it could be on C-3 or C-4. Can't tell which from this name.    The second does not indicate that there are two methyl groups (dimethyl, not methyl). Must be 3,3-dimethyl hexane to be correct  .

AA10335036	You asked the same question a day ago and I answered it. (Answer repeated below.) Were the answers wrong? Note that if you want numeric answers to  2, you have to provide a value for the speed of sound c, since it is variable. (EDIT: In an added comment to the other question you say c is not given. Then assume 343 m/s and use the equations I provided.)    1. Ref. (0 db) intensity level I0 = 1E-12 w/m^2.  I(70) = I0*10^(dB/10) = 1E-5 w/m^2   I(50) = I0*10^(dB/10) = 1E-7 w/m^2   Amplitude is a bit tricky since it's related to sound pressure (and intensity) by impedance. The impedance used below is 400 Pa-s/m, which is the nominal impedance used to relate ref. pressure to ref. intensity. (However, actual impedance is a complex function of air pressure and density.) Pressures and amplitudes are given below.  Ref. (0 db) pressure P0 = 2E-5 Pa.  omega = 2pi*f = 3141.59265 rad/s  P(70) = P0*10^(dB/20) = 6.3245553E-2 Pa  A(70) = P(70)/(omega*Z) = 5.033E-8 m  P(50) = P0*10^(dB/20) = 6.3245553E-3 Pa  A(50) = P(50)/(omega*Z) = 5.033E-9 m  2.   A. Resonant pipe fundamental wavelength lambda = 4L, fundamental frequency f = c/lambda  B. Since I don't know the intended value for c, I can't give a numeric answer. However from the basic equation f = sqrt(T/(m/L))/(2L) you can solve for tension T.   T = 4f^2*mL (L here is the length of the wire). See the ref.

The idea of using stem cells to regenearate tissue is a relatively new and very complicated process.Certain cells in your body are known as permanant cells such as cardiac myocytes and neurons.These have little to no regenerative capacity.Stem cells can in theory form these tissue but there are numerous complications.The major one is obviously graft rejection.Permanent cells,having little ability to regenerate or even repair,may not even be able to accept the graft.The best stem cells to be used is obviously that of the patient and so the best candidate is bone marrow cells.But like I said..its a new technology!

If the function is...    ... symmetrical about the y-axis, the function is even.  ... symmetrical about the origin, the function is odd.  ... symmetrical about the x-axis, it's not a function (doesn't pass the vertical line test).    If it's not symmetrical about the y-axis or the origin, it is neither odd nor even.  (I remember origin starts with "O" and so does "odd".)    As far as positive or negative... that's determined by the first multiplier, a.  If a is negative, the original graph is reflected about the x-axis.    You can also tell what the ends do by looking at the highest power on the variable and the sign on the constant of the highest power.    If a > 0 (positive) AND the highest power is even, the ends will both point up.  If a     If a > 0 (positive) AND the highest power is odd, the left end will point down and the right end will point up.  (Ex:  y = x^3)  If a     I hope that helps!

A pyroclastic flow is a ground-hugging avalanche of hot ash, pumice, rock fragments, and volcanic gas that rushes down the side of a volcano as fast as 100 miles per hour.|`|zLe2HNI2aa	i love you. :)|`|KUVRekuZaa	The classic one that took place in AD 79 is called a "Plinean" eruption as it was observed and written about by a famous Roman naturalist "Pliny the elder" was killed in the eruption and his nephew "Pliny the younger" famously and dramatically wrote about it. (It is worth reading, exciting and easy to read by an 11 year old)    Plinean eruptions are one of the most violent type of volcanic eruptions, and very dangerous, The magma has a large amount of gas in it and a huge tower of volcanic ash and extremely hot gasses shoots many miles into the stratosphere. When the eruption slackens the tower of ash and gas can colapse, and an avalanche of incandescent ash will flow down the slopes of the volcano at very high speed. These flows are called "pyroclastic flows" and wil incinerate everything in their path, then bury them under sometimes tens of meteres of ash. This is what buried the towns of Pompei and Herculanum.    Fortunately modern eruptions like the one in 1945 have been less violent, with mostly flows of lava, rather than the "Plinean" style of eruption    Hope this is informative without being too technical

Since we know that 4 cats catch 8 mice everyday we can make a simple equation. We can say that 4*8=mice caught in one day. We know that 4*8=32.     So now we know that 32 mice are caught in one day. But now we need to figure out how many mice are caught throughout the entire month. Since we know that January has 31 days we can say 31*32=number of mice caught in one month. When we multiply 31 and 32 together we get 992.    So now we have our answer.  -4 cats can catch 32 mice in one day.  -4 cats can catch 992 mice in the month of January.    I hope this helps!  -Taylor

However, studies also show that the Deccan Traps lava flows in India also had a major role.

Those that think the dinosaurs died out millions of years ago are perhaps unaware of the large amount of evidence indicating that they lived recently alongside man.    There are many written accounts and depictions of dinosaurs.  http://www.genesispark.org/genpark/ancie...  Remember that the word dinosaur was invented in 1841. Before that people used names like dragon.  People from all over the world have accounts of dinosaurs: the Chinese who have incorporated it into their lunar calendar, The Welsh who have the dragon in their flag; The account of the Saxon Beowolf; The native american thunderbird; and other stories from many other nations. The Romans even made mosaics of them.    Furthermore, dinosaur fossils have even been found containing blood cells - hardly 65 million years old.  http://www.googlesyndicatedsearch.com/u/...    But check the evidence for yourself - don't by brainwashed by dogmatic evolutionists who don't want us to think for ourselves :)  http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/...

E0U2yII3aa	For anyone who lived in the Pacific Northwest at the time, May 18, 1980 is a day they will never forget. It was a day that changed lives and the landscape of Washington state forever. It imposed a heavy toll in lost lives and lost habitat. Fifty-seven people were killed. More than 230 acres of forest were leveled in an instant.   The story of Mount St. Helens is a story of destruction. But it is also a story of renewal, a story of science, and a story of the importance of preparation. I rise today to share that story and the lessons it holds for us 25 years later.     Before the Blast   Perhaps the best place to start is before the eruption, when Mount St. Helens was a beautiful and striking feature of our landscape. This photo shows what the mountain looked like beforehand. As you can see, it had a nearly perfect dome. It was recognized as one of the most symmetrical mountains in the world. Mount St. Helens was surrounded by lush forests and beautiful streams and rivers. The area was filled with wildlife of all kinds, but danger lurked beneath that tranquil landscape.     That Fateful Day   May 18, 1980 began as a beautiful, sunny Sunday morning in the Northwest. Below the surface, however, Mount St. Helens was anything but calm. At 8:32am, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred. That earthquake sparked a massive eruption, which would last for nine hours. This photo shows some of what followed.   Within minutes, a massive cloud of ash and toxic gas spouted 15 miles into the air. A 300-mile per hour blast shot from the mountain  knocking down stands of evergreens as if they were matchsticks. The entire north face of the mountain gave way into a massive mudslide. The mudslide carried hot water and debris over the surrounding landscape. The eruption released 24 megatons of energy. It destroyed all forms of life within the 18- mile blast zone, including roughly 7,000 bears, elk, and deer.   The scope of the devastation was enormous. The hot ash from the eruption combined with melting snow at the mountaintop, creating massive mud flows.     Wide Impact   This was not just a local event. More than 500 million tons of ash were blown eastward across the United States. 250 miles away in Spokane, Washington, the traveling ash turned day into night. By June, ash could be found on the other side of the world.     Honoring Those Who Died   As we mark this 25th anniversary, I want to pay tribute to the 57 men and women who died on that fateful day. Some were there enjoying the areas beautiful scenery. Some were drawn to the mountain for scientific study. And others were long-time residents who refused to give up the only homes theyd ever known.     The Aftermath   When the dust settled and the mountain quieted, nearly 150,000 acres of public and private land had been destroyed. This photo shows some of the destruction. This stand of trees was blown down.   The mountain's nearly-perfect dome was turned into a crater. The Toutle River, which had been vibrant and green, was now a dark, grey expanse. President Jimmy Carter toured the site. He later remarked, "Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to whats up there."     Road to Recovery   Everyone knew that wildlife restoration would be a major challenge. Within weeks of the eruption, however, many dedicated foresters and biologists returned to the area to assess the damage and help with the recovery.   One of the strongest leaders in the revitalization has been the Weyerhaeuser Company. Weyerhaeuser lost nearly 68,000 acres of forest, making the company the largest private landowner impacted by the eruption. The company was able to replant over 45,500 acres with more than 18 million seedlings. Weyerhaeuser has been committed to restoring the area through sustainable forestry. 25 years later, many of the trees planted in the wake of the eruption are now ready for thinning. Final harvesting will begin in another 20 years, paving way for the forest cycle to recommence. The U.S. Forest Service made similar efforts. On 14,000 acres of National Forest land, the Forest Service has planted nearly 10 million trees since 1980.     The Monument   In August 1982, Congress established the 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. The monument allows unhindered natural growth and serves as a resource for visitors and academics.     Signs of Life   Within weeks of the eruption, signs of life literally sprouted through the layers of destruction. As forests were replanted and vegetation again took root, the wildlife also began to return. Roosevelt elk and Columbia black-tailed deer, for example, along with small birds and mammals, reestablished their habitats. Today the area is a testament to the enduring circle of life, as green hills surround the crater, and blue waters flow through the valley once again.     A Wealth of Knowledge   As the ecosystem rebuilds, we are constantly reminded of the wealth of knowledge available from the monument itself. Thousands of people have been drawn to the mountain to bear witness to the evidence of this power and to learn from its effects. For many, the eruption sparked a new interest in the earth sciences. It has provided new insight on seismology and volcanology, helping students and scientists to better understand the earths natural movement. Representatives of the U.S. Geological Survey have teamed with researchers at local and national universities to process the data and to continue monitoring movement beneath the ground. Teachers from across the country have brought hundreds of student groups to the Forest Service's three visitor centers. There, students study the eruption and the reemerging wildlife. What was once a bleak scene of destruction is now a living monument and an educational resource.     Need to I

U51Lal1Raa	What an interesting problem.  I enjoyed spending time on this.  Lets say you have the set {1, 2, 3}  (to talk about transitivity of  a relation on a set of less than 3 would be kind of degenerate).    To be reflexive (R), you need (1,1) and (2,2) and (3,3).  To be not R, you need to omit at least one of these.    To be symmetric (S), if you have (a,b) then you have to have (b,a).  To be not S, you need an (a,b) without the (b,a).    To be transitive (T), if you have (a,b) and (b,c) you need (a,c).  To be not T, you need an (a,b) and (b,c) without the (a,c).    To start with, the relation (1,1)(2,2)(3,3) is an equivalence  relation because it has RST.    The relation (1,1)(2,2)(3,3)(1,2) has RT (not S)    The null relation (no relations) has ST (not R) but pretty degenerate.  The relation (1,1) has ST (not R) somewhat degenerate?  The relation (1,1)(2,2)(1,2)(2,1) has ST (not R).    The hardest is:  (1,1)(2,2)(3,3)(1,2)(2,1)(1,3)(3,1) has RS (not T)  because (2,1) is in and (1,3) is in but not (2,3).    I wrote a program to help me on this.

dYqC3s10aa	Movement  Due to the temperature difference between the Earth's surface and outer core, and the ability of the crystalline rocks at high pressure and temperature to undergo slow, creeping, viscous-like deformation over millions of years, there is a convective material circulation in the mantle[3]. Hot material ascends as a plutonic diapir (somewhat akin to a lava lamp), perhaps from the border with the outer core (see mantle plume), while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. This is often in the form of large-scale lithospheric downwellings at plate boundaries called subduction zones [3]. During the ascent the material of the mantle cools down both adiabatically and by conduction into surrounding cooler mantle. The temperature of the material falls with the pressure relief connected with the ascent, and its heat distributes itself over a larger volume. Because the temperature at which melting initiates decreases more rapidly with height than does a rising hot plume, partial melting may occur just beneath the lithosphere and causing volcanism and plutonism.    The convection of the Earth's mantle is a chaotic process (in the sense of fluid dynamics), which is thought to be an integral part of the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with the older term continental drift which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.    Although there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear, and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core.[14] The mantle within about 200 km above the core-mantle boundary appears to have distinctly different seismic properties than the mantle at slightly shallower depths; this unusual mantle region just above the core is called D ("D double-prime" or "D prime prime"), a nomenclature introduced over 50 years ago by the geophysicist Keith Bullen[15]. D may consist of material from subducted slabs that descended and came to rest at the core-mantle boundary and/or from a new mineral polymorph discovered in perovskite called post-perovskite.    Due to the relatively low viscosity in the upper mantle one could reason that there should be no earthquakes below approximately 300 km depth. However, in subduction zones, the geothermal gradient can be lowered where cool material from the surface sinks downward, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of 400 km and 670 km.    The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ~136 GPa (1.4 million atm).[5] There exists increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is still thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent plastic deformation accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals comprising the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between 1019 and 1024 Pas, depending on depth,[14] temperature, composition, state of stress, and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of tectonic plate boundaries.|`|KUVRekuZaa	As Blandest says, convection currents rising from near the core, then spreading out sideways as they reach the top layers of the mantle.|`|JfqnGiQqaa	I think you are looking for simple answer: Convection Currents.
Gnfc4wRlaa	Crust:  The outermost layer of the Earth is the crust. This comprises the continents and ocean basins. The crust has a variable thickness, being 35-70 km thick in the continents and 5-10 km thick in the ocean basins. The crust is composed mainly of alumino-silicates.  The topmost layer is the lithosphere, which is comprised of the crust and solid portion of the upper mantle. The lithosphere is divided into many plates that move in relation to each other due to tectonic forces. The lithosphere essentially floats atop a semi-liquid layer known as the asthenosphere. This layer allows the solid lithosphere to move around since the asthenosphere is much weaker than the lithosphere.    Mantle: Under the crust is the rocky mantle, which is composed of silicon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, aluminum, and calcium. The upper mantle is rigid and is part of the lithosphere (together with the crust). The lower mantle flows slowly, at a rate of a few centimeters per year. The asthenosphere is a part of the upper mantle that exhibits plastic properties. It is located below the lithosphere (the crust and upper mantle), between about 100 and 250 kilometers deep.     Convection (heat) currents carry heat from the hot inner mantle to the cooler outer mantle. The mantle is about 1,700 miles (2,750 km) thick. The mantle gets warmer with depth; the top of the mantle is about 1,600 F (870 C); towards the bottom of the mantle, the temperature is about 4,000-6,700 F (2,200-3,700 C). The mantle contains most of the mass of the Earth. The Gutenberg discontinuity separates the outer core and the mantle.     Core: The Earth has a iron-nickel core that is about 2,100 miles in radius. The inner core may have a temperature up to about 13,000F (7,200C = 7,500 K), which is hotter than the surface of the Sun. The inner core (which has a radius of about 750 miles (1,228 km) is solid. The outer core is in a liquid state and is about 1,400 miles (2,260 km) thick.|`|dYqC3s10aa	0- 40 Crust   40- 400 Upper mantle   400- 650 Transition region   650-2700 Lower mantle   2700-2890 D'' layer   2890-5150 Outer core   5150-6378 Inner core|`|b845c224609298fb11f107e8162097f6aa	Let's see, there's the Lithosphere, Asthenosphere, Mantle, Outer Core and Inner Core|`|JfqnGiQqaa	Atmosphere  Crust & Upper Mantle (aka Lithosphere)  Low Viscoity Zone (aka Asthenosphere)  Lower Mantle  Outer Core  Inner Core

In 1829 J. W. D?bereiner stated that there existed some three-element groups, or triads, in which the atomic weight of the middle element was the average of the other two and the properties of this element lay between those of the other two. For example, calcium, strontium, and barium form a triad; lithium, sodium, and potassium, another. The English chemist J. A. Newlands found (186365) that if the elements are listed according to atomic weight starting with the second, the 8th element following any given element has similar chemical properties, and so does the 16th. This became known as the law of octaves. About the same time, A. E. de Chancourtois arranged the elements according to increasing atomic weight in the form of a vertical helix with eight elements in a turn, so that elements having similar properties fell along vertical lines.|`|UJkswz9Iaa	i think that the periodic law is a law that is goood oh and wats 10 points you funnayyyyy i got it right you now it boiiii or girllll

The same applies to anything else - why do some people play a musical instrument with ease and others struggle and never can even bang out a tune ?    Excellent teachers who can help someone like this are few and far between.  It takes a lot of patience and understanding of thought processes, and probably a lot of time.    I think anyone can learn math up to a certain point, or at least understand the concepts.    How to find such a teacher, unfortunately, I do not know in general.  Just ask everyone you know until you find one.
b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	Bipolar hip arthroplasty involves replacement of the femoral (thigh bone's) head and neck with a stem and a ball and an acetabular cup that is NOT attached to the pelvis.  Therefore it can articulate in TWO places: between the pelvis and the cup, and between the cup and the ball that is attached to the stem implanted in the femur.  See this link; scroll to images 11-13.  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/39...    In a total hip arthroplasty, the articular surfaces of both the acetabulum (pelvis) and femur (thigh bone) are replaced. This involves replacement of the femoral head and neck and the acetabulum is reamed out to accept a metal cup that is attached to the pelvis.  A total hip replacement permits only one point of articulation: between the ball and the implanted cup.  (See the above link, images 1-7)    In case my explanation isn't clear, here's a page that explains in more detail:  http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/39...|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Bipolar surgery? Never heard of it.|`|X68nU9hdaa	Before I got arthritis, I enjoyed an active lifestyle that included swimming, walking, bicycling.. But when I started getting arthritis, everyday life became difficult. The more I walked the worse it [the arthritis pain] got, the pain was like a knife twisting inside. Sometimes my hip would give out, it just wouldn't support me. Then there was the sharp pain. Before surgery, the pain was absolutely debilitating. I was getting totally disabled. I couldn't walk. I couldn't stand. That's when I decided that I needed to do something. Once at church I met an very old friend of mine who suffered from the same pain as mine and thats when she recommended me Fly2india4health Consultants in India , my first thought about surgery in India was fear. I researched on my condition and my possible treatment options. I also spoke with the associate orthopedic surgeon with Fly2india4health Consultants who gave me educational material to help set my expectations after surgery. I was also been told that I would be up the same day as surgery and I was. The most important thing after the surgery is exercise. After surgery, I didn't have to take a lot of pain medication - maybe for 2 or 3 days. I attribute that to the skill of my surgeon. I was driving two weeks after surgery, Had I known it was going to be this easy, I would have had it done much earlier. If u need any orthopaedic care I will certainly advice you to go to Fly2india4health Consultants!    Source:  http://www.fly2india4health.com

sMUwSqxeaa	The riparian vegetation in often dominated by woody, deciduous trees and shrubs such as alder, cottonwood, willow, salmonberry, oceanspray, elderberry, and snowberry. These deciduous plants support much higher insect populations that conifers in the uplands. Consequently, they are much more valuable as feeding areas for songbirds, especially during the nesting season. The riparian vegetation also contributes to stable water temperatures, water quality, and inputs of energy and nutrients to the water. All these promote a healthy river, which in turn provides food (aquatic invertebrates, fish, etc.) to wildlife like otters, kingfishers, dippers, and harlequin ducks.

eiim3tJuaa	Start doing some things now. Work on your swimming skills, become scuba certified, improve your public speaking and performance skills, and get as much experience with animals as you can. Zoos and Aquariums usually have volunteer opportunities for teens. Some have keeper positions,some offer camp counselor positions, other offer jr docents/guides; any of these will give you good experience for a zoological job. There are also camps, classes, and other volunteer opportunities that will give you the experience you need. And start learning what you can about animal training, animal behavior, psychology, and other subjects that may relate to being an animal trainer.    There are a few degrees that can help you get a job as a marine animal trainer. See the links below for some.    After college, you might not be able to get a job right away as a marine animal trainer. You may have to work a different job or work with other animals till a marine animal trainer position becomes available. It might also be a good idea to do some sort of internship before applying. An internship is a good way to get experience and it may help get your foot in the door.      http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.ht...  How do I become a marine animal trainer?    The following information is SeaWorld's basic job description, requirements, and background information on an entry-level animal trainer position.  ANIMAL TRAINER  Responsible for the daily care, feeding and maintenance of show animals. Develops and trains animal behaviors and performs in animal shows for the public and educational shows for school groups. An apprenticeship period of at least a year is required for all trainer positions, even with previous experience.  Our requirements for animal trainers include:   must be at least 18 years of age   prior experience training animals   public speaking, drama, or other performance and communication skills (a microphone test is part of the interview process)   experience working with animals   scuba diving certification   CPR certification   an ability to interact with the public   academic coursework in zoology, marine biology, animal behavior or psychology (preference is given to those applicants with a college degree)   strong swimming skills (part of the interview process is a rigorous swim test that includes a 200 ft. freestyle swim, a 100 ft. underwater swim, and a free-dive to the bottom of a 26 ft. pool.)   excellent physical health and the ability to lift 50 lbs.  In addition, even with previous training experience, new trainers are hired as associate trainers, and learn about SeaWorlds training methods and animals in at least a one-year apprenticeship period.    HOW TO GET EXPERIENCE  To try and see if a career in animal training or animal care is for you, SeaWorld offers a weeklong Career Camp for grades 9-12 during the summer at all three parks. Check online at SWBG-AdventureCamps.com for more information.  Many colleges and universities offer internship opportunities along with the local zoos or aquariums as part of a zoological science or similar type of degree program. Moorpark College in Southern California offers a special Exotic Animal Training and Management program designed for those who want to enter into zoological careers. In Florida, Santa Fe Community College and Pensacola Junior College offer similar programs. Volunteering at a local animal shelter, veterinarian, or wildlife rescue facility is another great way to get experience. In addition, many zoos and aquariums have docent or other volunteer positions available. It is also helpful to gain experience at the park or facility that youre interested in working for. At SeaWorld, many of our openings for trainer and animal care positions go to applicants that have worked at the park in another department such as education - so this is a great way to get your foot in the door.    Another thing to keep in mind is when position openings are available. At SeaWorld, we have most openings for trainers and animal care in the early spring, and usually post these positions on our website (www.becjobs.com) in late winter. During this time we hold the swim tests and microphone tests as the initial parts of the interview process.  As you can imagine, we get hundreds of applicants each year for trainer positions. For killer whale trainers there may only be one or two openings each year so this is an even more competitive area to get into. While a college degree is not currently required, those applicants that have a degree in marine biology, animal behavior, zoology, psychology, or related fields are almost always the ones that get interviews. Also, the swim test and microphone test are critical parts of the interview process. Most people who take these tests do not pass the underwater swim portion of this test, so it is critical to practice for this.  The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (www.aza.org) also posts career information and job openings on its website. We also have a lot more info on our website (www.swbg-animals.org) about training and other animal careers. Other great sites to check out are the websites for the International Marine Animal Training Association (www.imata.org) and the Society for Marine Mammalogy (this has an excellent section on pursuing a career in marine mammal science at  http://www.marinemammalogy.org/strat.htm    http://www.swbg-animals.org/connections/...  How do I become an Animal Trainer    |`|p0SOWgb5aa	If you want to become a trainer, you don't need to bother yourself with sciences like marine biology, oceanography or zoology, those would be courses that youw would pursue if you wanted to get into research but training has little or nothing to do with science and most marine parks prefer a degree in psychology.   In fact most trainers do not have science based degrees, showmanship and experience is what counts most, some of them don't have degrees at all. If you are looking to do go on with education and do an undergraduate degree, you could do psychology or animal behaviour or something like husbandry/management which is more likely to be appreciated.  There is also one college that does a degree in exotic animal training;   http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_s...    As previously mentioned: What they value most is experience so volunteering orold enough to, interning, at an aquarium or a zoo will probably help you, alternatively if you get a job in entertainment, that will work, public speaking and performance are very important to them.    A place that offers training experience relatively frequently is Miami Seaquarium, however the conditions there are more appalling than in most other aquariums holding cetaceans, so I would recommend you keep WELL away from that, don't come anywhere near it with a ten metre pole, avoid it like the pest and don't ever set foot into it but that is obviously up to you, other places will probably value it as training  http://www.miamiseaquarium.com/visitor_i...  However can I just say I cannot stress enough what a disgrace that place is....    I personally would recommend having a look to see if Epcot still offer internships with their dolphins, while I am generally not a friend of cetacean captivity, at least the exhibit is a higher standard than most facilities and the dolphins and trainers actually actively participate in research rather than shows:  http://mentor.lscf.ucsb.edu/pipermail/bi...    Something else I would recommend would be an Animal Care Internship at Mote Marine Aquarium:  http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendoc...  Mote is a very well respected and reputable research lab and as an Animal Care Intern you work with both rehab animals (they recently had a pygmy sperm whale) and their two resident dolphins (unreleasable rescues) Harley and Moonshine. While Mote does not do shows as they generally present their animals as close to natural as possible, they do do some training, mainly husbandry procedures as presenting parts of the body for inspection etc.  They also have a highschool internship which is however run by the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, not the hospital, during which students observe Harley and Moonshine and produce activity budgets and then go out in the wild to compare this to the behaviour of wild dolphins.    You could also try joining NOSB, the National Oceans Science Bowl for highschoolers:  http://www.oceanleadership.org/link/nosb  which is recommended if you want to go into marine biology, however, I am not sure how much SeaWorld and co will value that as they tend to steer clear of science and go for entertainment instead.    Be aware it is very competitive and it will be hard to get into and the pay is pretty horrible, a lot of trainers work second jobs because the parks know there are hundreds of people willing to take the job in the blink of an eye if they are displeased with the demands/suggestions/requests from their current trainers.    Before you pursue this any further, you should probably make sure you know what you are getting yourself into, ie. look beyond the glossy image of these shows. I know several people who thought exotic animal training was their dream job and did everything they could to achieve it, finally got accepted- then realised it was nothing like what they thought it would be and quit.Their main complaint about was that it was an artificial experience, extremely restricting and intellectually unchallenging. Sure you work closely with the animals, but mainly on human terms, because of the expectations and goals that need to be reached, there is very limited space for creativity and individuality, which makes the experience artificial. 2 out of 3 people I know that worked with captive cetaceans are now trying to get into working with wild animals instead as they find it both more challenging and rewarding. And that's before we even get to the cetacean captivity controversy.    However, whether to find out more about the career or to prepare you for the controversy and animosity you will most likely encounter at some point if this is your career choice you might want to read up on the controversy surrounding the captivity of cetaceans, do your own research. I provided some links in the source section... I -and many other people, both members of the general public and scientific community- feel the effects of captivity on cetaceans which are a group of highly intelligent and wide ranging predators,are inexcusable. Effects include the drastically reduced lifespan, increased disease load, artificial and hence stressful pod structure, premature separation and heightened aggression both to trainers and other animals.|`|a9da82d7c02f0d0c2e3f006a101c69c4aa	And none of those things will get you a job as an animal trainer.    Having a vet tech degree is good, but only so much as you will be able to understand the environment reports.  Zoologists study cellular biology and many marine biology and oceanography programs do not even consider marine mammals as part of the curriculum.    In order to work as a trainer in most zoos and Aquarium you need to know about training and that actually falls under the psychology department (comparative/developmental) and biological anthropology (primatology).  This gives you the theoretical background.      You would also be well prepared to take a basic dog training course.  The fact is that the same techniques you use for dog training are those you use for training all other animals as well.  This will give you the practical background of how all that theory really get applied.      I also do not know of a single instance where somebody who did not first volunteer for many years got a job as a trainer.  Usually, a first job in this field is where you volunteered, and once you get that first job, you can move to other zoos and aquarium.

If such a race existed, why would they bother with us? We're not nearly interesting enough to observe, since we're still in the phase of "killing each other off faster than making scientific progress over little chunks of land". We're also not a threat to any such a civilization.    Think of it like this. You're on an atv in the forrest. You stop for a moment to rest. As you sit down, you see a line of ants going from one log to another. They don't notice you, but clearly, you've spotted them.    What do you do? They pose no threat, and they aren't going to understand you if you chose to enlighten them and have them make little ant atv's out of metal. So why bother doing anything?

You are asking yourself "Why don't the people in this house let me know they are in there?" Before you can ever get an answer to that question, you have to get the answers to other questions first:    > Is there anyone in the house at all?    > Does anyone in the house know I'm out here?    > Am I capable of letting them know I'm here? Maybe the doorbell doesn't work or they're hard of hearing and can't hear me knocking, or are in the middle of some delicate project, or in the shower.    > Would they be willing to open their door to me even if they knew I'm here?     > Would we be able to communicate at all?

I'm in that third category, I know aliens are here as a fact, to me, and millions of others it is not an issue of speculation, or just a fun dinner-party topic of conversation, it is reality. Aliens are here, kids, get used to the idea, because it isn't going to go away. How you've managed to lie to yourselves for this long is beyond me, frankly. It requires the complete disregard of mountains of evidence and testimony.    "I can assure you the flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth."  -Former U.S. President Harry S. Truman - Press conference, Washington DC, April 4, 1950.    "An investigator for the Air Force stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers. Approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 feet tall. Dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots." --From a March 22, 1950 memo to J. Edgar Hoover from the Washington FBI Office, released in 1976 under the freedom of information act.    "I know that neither Russia nor this country has anything even approaching such high speeds and maneuvers. Behind the scenes high ranking officers are soberly concerned about UFOs, but through official secrecy and ridicule many citizens are led to believe that the unknown flying objects are nonsense. . .To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personell."  -Admiral Roscoe Hillencoter, former director of the CIA, at a 1962 NICAP press conference in Washington D.C.    "The phenomenon of UFOs does exist, and it must be treated seriously."  -Former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev (Soviet Youth, May 4, 1990)    U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and pilot. "I remember the case in Georgia in the 1950's of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and never returning. And I recall the case in Franklin, Kentucky, when four military planes investigated a UFO. One of them exploded in midair and no one knows why."    "Hell no, you can't go. I can't go, and don't ask me again." --Senator Goldwater quoting General Curtis Lamey's response to the senator's request to visit the "Blue Room" at Wright Patterson Air Force Base where, Goldwater claims he was told physical evidence exists confirming the existence of alien spacecraft.    "I've been convinced for a long time that the flying saucers are real and interplanetary. In other words we are being watched by beings from outer space."  -Albert M. Chop, deputy public relations director at NASA, and former US Air Force spokesman for Project Blue Book.    "The real danger to the U.S. and perhaps this whole planet is the government has placed such a heavy blanket of secrecy upon this issue. So much secrecy, those in government who have knowledge showing UFOs are identifiable feel the subject cannot be discussed by those in the know without serious repercussions. Others are afraid their friends and co-workers will think they are crazy if they even so much as insinuate that UFOs are identifiable as manned craft from outside the earth. This particularly applies to newspaper editors and publishers, reporters and analysts. Thus the U.S. is denying itself the chance to learn more about UFOs or to encourage research despite the fact the U. S. stands to gain from such discussions. . . .Not publicized but true is that the Clinton administration, soon after coming to office, had many briefings on the subject. Laurance Rockefeller provided the information for the President and Mrs. Clinton. Others provided documents and verbal briefings to presidential advisors Jack Gibbons (science), Bruce Lindsay (personal), Anthony Lake (national security) and Vice President Albert Gore. About the same time a three hour briefing was given by Dr. Steven Greer to the sitting Director of the CIA, Admiral Woolsey. . . .After the Roswell incident, the Air Force replied to reporters' inquiries that this was all part of research using weather balloons and other equipment. [Colonel] Corso and hundreds of others who work or have worked in secret defense and scientific agencies, are willing to swear under oath that alien craft are repeatedly penetrating our airspace."  -Sarah McClendon, White House Correspondent, and Dean of the White House Press Corps--    "We can no longer think... is it true? Is it not true? Are they truths or are they lies--if we believe or if we don't believe--no! There are already numerous considerations which make the existence of these beings into a certainty we cannot doubt."  -Monsignor Corrado Balducci, a Vatican theologian "close to th

805d5aa14fdca671ed6b65dfbb2b1962aa	Once upon a time. billions of years ago, long before our own univerase existed or was even thought of, there existed within a different set of dimensions, another older, previous universe, called Old Universe.    In Old Universe there were places not unlike our own Earth, one of which was populated by sentient beings not all that different from ourselves. And among these beings were scientists including physicists and engineers.    These Old Universe physicists carried out an experiment in the Old CERN that was supposed to duplicate the conditions they believed existed just prior to the creation of their Old Universe.    And it came to pass that these Old Universe physicists threw the switch that started their experiment. Unfortunately their experiment worked even better than they thought it would.    Instantly blowing a hole in the fabric of Old Universe, in the blink of an eye Old Universe began to implode and collapse down that hole, destroying the entire Old Universe and everything in it, including Old Earth, Old Cern, and all the old physicists in it.    Simultaneously, on the other side of the hole, in another set of dimensions, there was being created a brand new Big Bang and the beginnings of a totallty different new Universe.    As all the mass, matter and energy, funneled down and was sucked out of Old Universe, New Universe began to grow from nothingness into the present day Universe of stars and galaxies that you know today, including our own familiar planet Earth, which, at about this time in its history, has evolved to the point where life forms intellegent enough to understand the conditions which preceeded the Big Bang are beginning to experiment in their laboratories, trying to duplicate those conditions. Soon will be designing an experiment to recreate those conditions...    Mhuhahahaha    Sound far-fetched? Don't believe that physicists would do something so rash or reckless that it could destroy the whole Universe?    Think about this: When physicists went to test the first atomic bomb they themselves postulated that the thermoneuclear detonation might begin a chain reaction within the air and all of Earth's atmosphere could become a thermoneuclear bomb, destroying all life on Earth.    Not actually knowing whether this could happen or not, yet they still went ahead and prerformed the test.

PS: radzewick, how do you know that nuclear bomb can initiate chain reaction that makes all atmosphere becomes nuclear bomb either? could you provide me a link?

AA11964262	In order to get moles, you need to take your g and divide by the g/mol of each substance. To do that though, you need a periodic table to tell you the g/mol of each substance. The atomic weight is the g/mol.     I can do the first one by memory for you as an example. H = 1.0079 and you have 2 of them so H = 2.0158 and O = 15.999 so together it weighs 18.0148 mol. So: .237g/18.0148 = 0.013mol

b691c3ca62fd1d8844180c2c83daccbcaa	This is a tpyical "limiting reagent" calculation.  First of all, you need to know the correct balanced equation for what will happen. in this case, mixing these two solutions will result in the formation of insoluble lead chloride, PbCl2, as    Pb++  +  2 Cl-  --->  PbCl2    This tells you that for every Pb++ ion you must have 2 Cl- ions to form a PbCl2 molecule. If you have more than enough Cl- ions to react with all of the Pb++ ions present, then Pb++ is the limiting reagent. But if you have more than enough Pb++ ions to react with all of the Cl- ions present, then Cl- is the limiting reagent.  So, you need to calculate how many of each ion will be present, and don't forget to convert mL to L before multiplying molar concentrations and volumes:    moles of Pb++ = [Pb++] X volume = 0.750 X 0.0781 = 0.0586 moles  moles of Cl- = [Cl-] X volume = 0.855 X 0.125 = 0.1069    So to use up all of the Pb++ ions, you would need 2 X 0.0586 = 0.1172 moles of Cl-, which you clearly do not have.  Therefore the most PbCl2 that can be formed when these two solutions are mixed is (moles of Cl-) / 2 = 0.1069 / 2 = 0.05345 moles  Now just use the mol wt of PbCl2 to determine how many grams that will be...

WkWedRnoaa	I worked with a man who, as a young man, with his brothers, created a "ufo" picture out of a pie plate, a flashlight, and a hand holding the plate.  Because of a hill and moon in the background, the photo was accepted in the ufo community as "evidence" for about 20 years, until one of the brothers confessed to a reporter investigating the sighting.    The videos "look" real, but so do a lot of things in the "star wars" movies, Lord of the Rings movies, etc.  Basically, there is just a movie of "something".  What I want, in addition to the footage, is to know everything about the persons with the cameras, about whether anyone else saw the same things from different angles, what the local meteorological conditions were, what was seen on radar, and whether anyone can make the same things "appear" in a lab by manipulating the pixels and digital images.  And so far, there is still no "evidence" of "real" ufo's.  People used to burn witches (still do in parts of the world), see comets and planetary conjunctions as "omens", etc.  UFO's are just modern witches which may eventually be explained by mass hysteria, unknown physics or meteorology, or by a real alien spaceship landing on the white house lawn during a rose garden press conference.      2nd look:  In the first television footage, why does the "coverage end abruptly?"  Where was the zoom that television cameras are capable of?  When did this occur?  Who are all the people on the bridge?  What laboratory has had the opportunity to examine the film images?  In the second, over France, the object moves in a manner very similar to that of kite, and having only a single point of view does not give any "evidence" that it was anything but a kite.  In the third, over the river, the inability of the cameraman to keep a object at a great distance in focus leads me to believe that the flying item was close and small.  The fact that it literally "disappeared" over the bridge makes it appear that the film/video has been doctored.  The motion of the object looks much like that of a remote controlled hovercraft, as do the the "fins" which seem to pop in and out of the object.    I'm willing to believe in alien-piloted or controlled UFO's, but in my 40+ years of looking at the "evidence", I haven't seen any evidence yet that definitively shows either a non-human intelligence, an off-earth origin, or anything that can only be explained in terms of an alien intelligence.  Speculation works both ways.

Ehav49YFaa	No energy is expended.      Diffusion is the passive movement   of molecules from an area of high  concentration to an area of lower   concentration.    (Passive movement means no   energy is required to cause them   to move that way.)      I must comment on some comments  made. Facilitated diffusion doesn't  cause the cell to expend energy as the  molecules are moving along the   concentration gradient.  It is only when molecules need   to be moved against their concentration   gradient that the carrier protein   needs ATP (energy) to induce 'Active  Transport'.        :D|`|SsdRuG00aa	depends if its facilitated or passive diffusion     if its passive, no energy is expended since the particles move with the concentration gradient.     facilitated diffusion requires special membrane proteins. if it is pushing against the gradient it is known as active, this expends energy|`|CZwFNUoOaa	uses no energy as it goes with the concentration gradient so no energy is needed it moves on its own|`|p5H70NEeaa	The cell will expend no energy in normal diffusion because the molecules are moving down their concentration gradient.  Because the membrane is permeable to these molecules, they move easily through.  With some larger molecules that are unable to diffuse through on their own they undergo what is called facilitated diffusion.  This is where a carrier protein on the cells membrane is used to move the molecule across the membrane, the carrier protein does require the use of ATP (energy) to do this.  This method is used when something small is needed within the cell, but must move against its concentration gradient to reach the inside, or when a molecule is to large.  Usually the carrier protein is depicted in text books as being open at one end (facing outside the cell), here the molecule will attach itself to the inside of the open end, then with the expending of energy the protein will close the outside end and open up in toward the cell to allow the new substance within.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	strength is too vague a term. You should use "Yield strength" and/or "Tensile strength" and/or "Fatigue strength" and/or "Impact strength".    Hardness is not analogous to strength and does not replace it.    wikipedia:    In materials science, the strength of a material refers to the material's ability to resist an applied stress. The applied stress may be tensile, compressive, or shear.     The term strength of materials most often refers to various methods of calculating stresses in structural members, such as beams, columns and shafts, when the equations of equilibrium are not sufficient to solve the problem. In such problems, known as statically indeterminate problems, the elastic or plastic resistance of the material to deformation must be considered when calculating stresses. In this sense, the word "strength" could well be replaced by "stiffness", but the usage goes back to at least 1930 and is not likely to go away any time soon.    Yield strength is the lowest stress that gives permanent deformation in a material. In some materials, like aluminium alloys, the point of yielding is hard to define, thus it is usually given as the stress required to cause 0.2% plastic strain.    Compressive strength is a limit state of compressive stress that leads to compressive failure in the manner of ductile failure (infinite theoretical yield) or in the manner of brittle failure (rupture as the result of crack propagation, or sliding along a weak plane - see shear strength).    Tensile strength or ultimate tensile strength is a limit state of tensile stress thats leads to tensile failure in the manner of ductile failure (yield as the first stage of failure, some hardening in the second stage and break after a possible "neck" formation) or in the manner of brittle failure (sudden breaking in two or more pieces with a low stress state). Tensile strength can be given as either true stress or engineering stress.    Fatigue strength is a measure of the strength of a material or a component under cyclic loading, and is usually more difficult to assess than the static strength measures. Fatigue strength is given as stress amplitude or stress range ( = max ? min), usually at zero mean stress, along with the number of cycles to failure.    Impact strength, it is the capability of the material in withstanding by the suddenly applied loads in terms of energy. Often measured with the Izod impact strength test or Charpy impact test, both of which measure the impact energy required to fracture a sample.    .|`|lsuVEx0Faa	Exactly what Jim B said. It is very common to have components heat treated to create a hard "case" around a "tough" core. Specifying the hardness of the surface gives you a means of confirming the heat treatment process.|`|6tAIUchSaa	Hardness relates to the grade of material. Usually when in reference to steel. The harder a steel is, the more brittle it becomes. Strength is more related to how stretchy or maliable the material is plus it's load factor ie tensile strength. I'm an aircraft engineer. The reason hardness is more often specified on engineering drawings is because the drawing specifies the material the component is made from and it's properties. The tensile strength therefore relates to the performance of the completed manufactured component|`|wHmgVhphaa	The hardness is an element that can be used to determine the strength.|`|9Wi2eNInaa	Hardness is usually specified for components that are moving members or high friction members     If you have a steel shaft , you are concerned about wear capabilities where it is attached to bearings for example.     If you have drill stems or any cutting tools hardness is probably more important than the strength. Most of the time there is a trade off between hardness and strength, as was pointed out , when you make steel hard it also gets more brittle    There are compromises (like case hardening) where the outside is harder than the inside but the steel inside retains the pliability and deformability of regular steel without breaking|`|t9ZF0AyEaa	When desining a component you choose the material based on its properties ie tensile  strength etc then as a post operation the material can be heat treated to certain hardness to enhance peformance for the given use|`|sOFtmJTkaa	hah thats weird...i got a question exactly like that for a class called "Manufacturing Process" at a University in Texas!...maybe we go to the same school!
ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	No, the big bang has not been proved, that is why it is called a theory.  If it was proved, it would be just a fact.    The big bang has nothing to do with the movement of the planets in our solar system.  It is a separate matter entirely and happened a very long time before any solar system formed.      If you have been told that all the matter was compressed into one tiny dot, or that the movement of planets in our solar system is due to the big bang, whoever told you was wrong or was deliberately lying.  There are people who do that.    Briefly, the expansion of the Universe indicates that it expanded from something very small.  It is space that is expanding, not just the galaxies that are in the space, they are just along for the ride.  This expansion has been observed and more importantly, measured.    If that was true, then the Universe would be filled with radiation which wouild be consistent with a temperature just above absolute zero.  That was predicted in the 1940s or early 1950s.  This radiation was accidentally found in 1964 or 1965 by two younger astronomers who were working on satellite antennas.  They found a constant noise in their receivers and on asking a senior astronomer found that it was the predicted radiation.  The radiation is in the microwave part of the spectrum and has been measured many times since 1965. If you tune a TV set to a spot between channels, some of the noise comes from this radiation.       A third leg of evidence is that if the Universe expanded from a tiny dot, it was possible to predict the overalkl chemical composition.  That was worked out from research on hydrogen bombs.  The composition predicted was 73% hydrogen, 25% helium and the rest mostly boron and lithium. Observations and measurements of the Universe at present show just this composition.      Fourthly, Einstein's equations predicted an expanding Universe.  His equations were found to be correct.       The matter in the Universe did not begin to form until about 3 minutes after the start, and atoms did not form until maybe 100,000 years later according to the theory, which is based on hydrogen bomb and other research into sub-atomic particles.  .      All that was close to 13.7 thousand million years ago.     Maybe a million years later the first stars began to form, there were no planets then as the elements like carbon,  iron, oxygen and silicon that form planets did not then exist.    These element were formed inside the big stars.  The bigger a star is, the more quickly it burns and when the centre runs out of fuel, it begins to collapse very quickly.  This collapse results in a very violent form of nuclear reaction that can cause the star to explode.  Such explosions are sometimes called supernovas, one was seen in 1987 in one of the Magellanic Clouds, I saw it myself.   This reaction is what produces elements like carbon, iron aluminium, silicon and so forth right up to uranium.  This stuff pushed out of the stars is unused hydrogen, helium and the heavier elements.    These elements float round the place in the form of dust and gas for millions of years, and sometimes begin to collapse under their own weight to form stars and associated solar systems.  That is the origin of our solar system.  Every piece of metal or dirt you see, all the atoms inside it were once inside a big star.    Our solar system and Sun are just about 4.6 thousand million years old, just about one third of the age of the Universe. Our Sun formed from a cloud of hydrogen and helium and other elements and makes up more than 99% of the mass of the solar system,  The planets formed from dust and gas that were also in the original cloud.     Since these clouds are moving slightly as a whole, when they begin to collapse some of that movement is translated in to rotation.  When  the central star begins to shine, the radiation and gas flowing out from it tends to push the light elements like hydrogen away from it, but the bigger, heavier particles like grains of dust containing carbon, iron, silicon etc do not move so fast.  They can collapse on their own to form rocky planets like Earth, Mercury, Venus and Mars.      The lighter elements like hydrogen and helium therefore tend to be in the outer parts of the system, and you will find that the outer planets like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are predominantly hydrogen and helium.  In the furthest parts of the system the radiation forn the star is weakest and you might find that planets out there like Pluto or Sedna might represent the original compostion of the cloud of gas and dust.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	In fact the supposed resulting chemicals and material does exist - it's what scientists attribute to the big bang.    It's a theory, so no it has not been proved. Your reason is not logical though and makes no credible basis for a conversation. You do not know the supposed origin/epicenter of the proposed big bang so you cannot calculate where exactly all the planets would be.  Furthermore, gravity more or less determines the location of things in space, which further demonstrates the complete lack of logic in your stated reason.    Need I continue? I don't think so.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Wow, according to someone who obviously doesn't know the first thing about the theory, it couldn't possibly be true.  What a good thing all those people who spent 20+ years of their life studying it with massive telescopes have you around to help them.    There is no connection between the big bang and the rotation of planets.  I'm not even sure why you think their would be.  That's like saying gods can't exist because my cat is fuzzy.  So what?  What's the connection?    Why couldn't all the matter and energy in the universe be compressed into a singularity?  You don't just get to say 'it couldn't' without backing it up.      Please take a science class.|`|aOBmcGAZaa	Darn straight you're confused. You think celestial mechanics disproves BBT.    I don't even know how one makes that kind of leap of logic.    Also, how come all the matter in the universe couldn't be compressed in a tiny dot? Think of super massive black holes at the center of galaxies. Now, these black holes often have hundreds, if not thousands, and even up to billions of stellar masses bound up inside of them. Despite this, the black hole itself will only have a radius of maybe from the size say, a minor planet, up to the size of perhaps the size of a normal star for the super massive black holes.    The higher gravity gets, the more compressed the matter inside the gravity well can get.    There are signs that point to the BBT theory being correct. For one, background cosmic radiation was predicted to be a sign of the BBT, and that was found in 1965 Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson.    The redshifting and blueshifting of the galaxies as found by Edwin Hubble and their proportion to their distance relative to our own galaxy supports BBT, and in fact was found before BBT even existed.    Try reading the link I gave you, that might help your understanding a bit.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Gee, with that kind of logic, you couldn't prove that you arm exists.

HOWEVER, scientists in a number of disciplines,  including physics and astronomy, have come up with so much evidence and so many observations that only make sense if, at one point about 13 billion years ago, everything in the universe was squashed into a singularity that rapidly expanded.  "according to me" is not science unless you've got several hundred years and millions of observations and experiments supporting your belief/theory.    The Big Bang "Theory" means that science has so much supporting evidence that has been peer-evaluated, duplicated, etc., that the "theory" is the most reasonable explanation of how things came to be as they are now.  Theory is not "hypothesis".  Theory has been tested, retested, and retested to ensure that all the available evidence fits into the explanation.  At this point, any evidence that does not "fit" with the theory is not discarded, but is subject to intense scrutiny and to the slight modification of the overall theory which has to explain or allow for everything we see and understand.  No theory, other than the Big Bang theory, explains everything as well.|`|JYyOjAqdaa	1)  Define 'tiny dot'..  2)  Aside from Venus and Uranus, all planets DO in fact revolve properly, although i dont see the relationship between orbital characteristic and the Big Bang      The cosmic microwave background is about the closest to hard evidence that we have to prove that the Big Bang actually happened.  To this date, its the most logical, feasible, and widely accepted theory (runner up would be 'God') as to how our universe was created, but it IS just a theory.|`|De4vgWXPaa	>    No theories in science have ever been proven.  That's not how science works.  Rather, the evidence presently indicates there was (and is) an expansion underway, and the start of that is termed the big bang.    >    It certainly doesn't.  The big bang predates the formation of the solar system by something like nine billion years and, therefore, has no particular influence on the directions of planetary rotation.|`|pUzJiMUcaa	It is a theory, and that's about as far as it will ever get unless we find the proverbial smoking gun..    Still, it is the theory that is supported by the most (and best) observable evidence.     There is much more to support it than the fact that the universe is expanding. There is Hubble's law, the Cosmological Principle, Cosmic Radiation, and many other tenets that uphold the idea behind the Big Bang.    Oh and your rotation argument doesn't really...um...make sense...Chaos Theory could likely explain why planets rotate/revolve in different directions, but nothing could explain why that difference disproves the big bang..    As far as matter being compressed, it's hard for people to get their mind around. Just remember this: Any given atom is composed of well over 99% free and open space. That's a lot of room for compression.|`|050a8f9daaa946feace7fefca4f5ba79aa	The Big Bang is just a theory as others have been saying, but it's a scientific theory, meaning that's it's as close as we can get at the moment. Scientific theories and laws are on the same level. We have ways of knowing that the Big Bang Theory very likely happened. Such as observable after math - the fact that the universe is expanding, etc. Do some research about it.|`|1a73329e9b206ad5ece8b6d04e552014aa	The Big Bang Theory of the beginning of the universe is just that: a theory. "Proving" it is like solving a locked-room murder mystery: no one was there to see it, so all you can do is try to put together a picture of what happened using the clues that were left behind. While the Big Bang theory has some flaws in it as an explanation for how the universe came to be, it does have some hard evidence to back it up, and so far no one has come up with anything better.     Incidentally,  your own points aren't among the flaws that might disprove it. Planets rotate in different directions for the same reason stars and galaxies aren't moving in a uniform direction: As the momentum from the Big Bang wore down, and matter began coalescing into gravity-generating bodies like stars, "loose" matter would start to get pulled in every direction - and as they form into planets, set to spin in whatever direction most of the mass was going. And while I don't have the math right in front of me, the gist as I understand it is that the Primordial Atom that exploded into the Big Bang contained not only all the matter in space, but the fabric of space itself, so limits of how small it could be compressed are not a factor.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	Of all the theories that have been proposed to explain the behavior of our universe, it is the only one that explains everything we observe.    As a bonus, it is the only one that allows that the universe could have been created.  It does not state that there was a Creator, it only allows that there could have been one.  That is the reason fervent atheists were dead set against it. The fact that the Big Bang theory was started by a priest did not help to convince atheists.    It has been "proven" in the sense that the predictions it made have turned out to be correct, while other theories either failed to predict the same observations or, even worst, predicted that the observation should not exist.    One example is the Cosmological Microwave Background radiation.  Someone used the hypotheses in the theory to "predict" that if the theory is correct, then we should observe a radiation that comes from all over the universe, at a frequency close to that used in microwave.  The prediction was made in the 1940s.    It may even have been that it was calculated by someone wanting to prove that the theory was wrong (because that is often how science works).    In 1964, two technicians testing a powerful microwave antenna discovered the CMB radiation.  They were not even looking for it when they started their tests (but they were aware of the research being done by astronomers).    According to the other big theory at the time (Steady State) the CMB radiation cannot even exist.    ---    The Big Bang has nothing to do with rotation of planets.  In that regards, you are correct to state that you are confused.    Our solar system came from a gigantic cloud of dust and gas that started to "fall" onto itself, by its own gravity, almost 6 or 7 billion years after the expansion of the universe began.  The Big Bang theory deals with the entire universe.  It does not deal with "puny" objects like galaxies, even less with individual planetary systems.    When the cloud collapsed, it picked up a direction of rotation.  All that rotational momentum is still conserved in the Solar system by the rotation of the Sun and the orbital direction of the planets.    It was recently calculated that the Sun's tidal effect is sufficient, by itself, to have "flipped" the rotation of Venus in a mere 4 billion years.  As for Uranus, we are not sure, but it has nothing to do with the Big Bang.    In any event, the rotational energy in the rotation of a planet is nothing compared to the rotational energy in its orbital movement.    ---    The Big Bang theory does NOT state that the matter in the universe was compressed into a single dot.  What it shows it that at some point, the universe was so hot that every single point was a black hole (or whatever would be the equivalent for mathematical points).  However, at that temperature, we know that matter cannot exist (and not even the forces), only pure energy.    ---    Much confusion comes from words.    Fred Hoyle (the astrophysicist -- and atheist -- who spent his entire life wanting to prove that the Big Bang theory was wrong), is the one who came up with the awful name "Big Bang".  He did that to make fun of the theory and to confuse people: even today, some people think that the theory involves an explosion (there was no explosion, only an expansion that is still going on).    The original name of the initial hypothesis, formulated by Father Lemaitre, was the Primordial Atom Hypothesis.  The name gives the impression that the theory calls for matter to be compressed into a single dot (because of the modern meaning of the word atom).  The older meanings of the word atom include "unity".  The early universe was an undistinguishable "unity" of high energy density.    Father Lemaitre liked the idea of "pure energy" as many people define God as being pure energy.  But the theory does not force us to accept this.  It only requires us to understand that, at some very high temperature and pressure, the universe would have no lumps, no distinguishable parts.

Ask yourself how would you divide or multiply 10m and 340m/s to get a time, e.g. seconds and cancel meters? . . .|`|Mf6PV2v3aa	S = speed of sound = 340 m/s, which means that it will do 340 meters in 1 second.    You have 2 persons that are at 5 and 15 meters from the source. Which means that the sound, as soon as it has reached the first person will travel a distance of 10 meters before reaching the second person ( it doesn't matter if they are on a straight line with the source since the sound propagates as a sphere )    Hence : 340 meters in 1 seconds   Thus 10 meters in X seconds.     You need to find the time X. It is a simple equation now :    (1*10)/340 = 1/34 seconds (approx 29.41 milliseconds)    Good luck and ask me if u need more details ;-)    Edit : Yes the answer is .029411765s ;-)|`|W11bYeZ9aa	The speed of sound is in m/s, the distance is in m.

GKHd2CrPaa	If i remember correctly, the mass number is the number of protons and neutrons added together. and the number of protons has to equal the number of protons (electrons-negative, protons-positive). so if the number of protons is 12, and the mass number 24, then the number of neutrons is 12.|`|5TtzuKEWaa	12    I agree with Kristen.

The answer can't be given with the information received.    In order to figure out how many neutrons are in this atom, we need the atomic number, and the atomic mass.     Now, if both the atomic mass and the atomic number are 24, then we can solve this problem.    Neutrons = atomic mass - atomic number.    Now. there is another way to solve this. Providing the atom in question does *not* have an ionic charge, the electrons and protons in the atom will be exactly the same.    Thus you get Atomic mass (24) - atomic number (12) = 12. Thus there are 12 neutrons in this atom.|`|Z6qAmklNaa	Protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1 atomic mass unit (AMU).  The mass of electrons is sooooo small that it is basically 0.  Take the atomic mass number subtract the atomic number (the number of protons) and you will have the number of neutrons.

lvLtLuXMaa	Standard time happened in England, promoted by Abraham Osler and implemented first in the 1840s by the railroads, to keep their train schedules organized. But Britain had only one time zone and every town was on the same time.    To quote http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/i...     Canadas Sir Sandford Fleming played a crucial role in developing a global system for setting time. He apparently became an advocate of time zones after spending an uncomfortable night in a railway station because of time confusion. Fleming, who came to Canada from Scotland in 1845, was Canadas foremost railway surveyor and construction engineer of the 19th-century.     Fleming instigated the initial efforts that led to the adoption of the time zones used by the railways in 1883 and the global time zones we use today. Fleming advocated dividing the world into 24 time zones, each equal to 15o of longitude and to one hour, beginning at the Greenwich Meridian (0o longitude). He was instrumental in convening the International Prime Meridian Conference in Washington in 1884. Representatives of 25 nations from Europe, North and South America and Asia attended; all adopted Flemings system of international standard time. Fleming did not invent standardized time, but he is the father of international standard time.|`|2d3ab98f216743c75f2f200fa734cb7caa	I do not know the answer to yo  Q ..  but you should visit the on/line museum at Greenwich England ))) this is where time was kept for many years until they moved to the atomic "" time clock"" that is housed in Paris, France ..

GMT is the mean solar time at the prime meridian (the line of longitude where east meets west), which runs through Greenwich in the UK. GMT is measured from midnight, so the new day begins at 0000 GMT and the time six hours later would be expressed as 0600 GMT. "Mean solar time" refers to the local time on the prime meridian, using the hypothetical rather than the actual position of the sun. The earth does not orbit the sun evenly, and its axis is tilted in relation to the sun. In the course of one solar day, the earth spins once on its axis and it takes 365 days to complete one full revolution of the sun. However, the relative position of the sun varies throughout the year. At particular times it apparently slows down or speeds up - shortening and lengthening the day by up to 16 minutes. That's why we need to use the average (mean) day length and a hypothetical mean sun when calculating GMT.    Prior to 1925, GMT for sailors and astronomers was measured from midday, while the "civil day" began at midnight. This civil time was also known as GMT, which made for much confusion! In 1925 it was agreed that the two GMTs should be synchronised. Time was thereafter measured from midnight to midnight.    Does Universal Time (UT) differ from GMT?  Universal Time (UT) is really a new name for GMT, and the term UT is officially preferred as it avoids the ambiguity of GMT. From 1928, GMT measured from midnight became known internationally as universal time. By 1972, atomic clocks had been developed which could keep an incredibly accurate standard time, which could be used throughout the world. GMT is not quite in line with this atomic time, because the scientific definition of a single second has changed. A second is no longer defined as a fraction of a mean solar day but by measuring the frequency of radiation of caesium. GMT is thus no longer the world's time standard, nor is it used for scientific purposes. In practise, many people use the terms GMT and UT interchangeably, and GMT does still form the legal basis for UK civil time.|`|NprrQEreaa	uhguk|`|8aL1bsi3aa	Some psycho that wanted to give us jet lag.|`|tezszivdaa	benjamin franklin was the first to bring it up but it didn't work because not a lot of people agree with him. but that was the time when the united states was only in one time zone.    but later i think it was during the 1870s, they started to use time zones because the train schedules were a bit off by one or two hours. so then they divided up the country into five time zones.    but i really don't remember who thought of it. i remember they mention something about it in the first national treasure movie.|`|LrtgKFkZaa	Benjamin Franklin invented the idea of time zones b/c of the sun rises later in the west and all that good stuff, but for real it was Benjamin Franklin|`|MlNrzpBaaa	benjamin franklin, and he "invented" it because of the cross country trains (in america), and he figured out that there is a time different between differrent parts of the country|`|IPu3SN7eaa	The British decided, back when they were an empire, and travel around the world and between countries had become common.

The small farmer only lets a few chickens mate and have fertile eggs to replace losses of his flock which are kept separately, but if there are more than enough eggs, the overage goes out with the unfertilized eggs. Eggs removed from the nest and placed in a refrigerator instead of an incubator simply do not develop. The blood you see is incidental from the chicken when the egg forms and gets caught up in the final part of development, which is when the shell forms just before being laid. It has nothing to do with whether the egg is fertilized or not. By the way, in the far east, fertilized eggs after some period of time are placed in vinegar (which kills the embryo) with some spices and then buried in the ground to ferment for months, even years. These are considered a special delicacy. I believe the name is Ballute (sp?). These are almost developed chicks just short of hatching. Peeling one is just... for lack of a better word, GROSS and the smell is really, really BAD. I got a chance to eat one of these in Korea. It did not taste as bad as it smelled which was almost as bad as the home made kim-chi served at the same time. Kim-chi is fermented cabbage, buried in vinegar just like the eggs, but with many spices. Anyway, I digress. The blood sometimes get caught up in the shell at the end of formation and has nothing to do with whether the egg is fertilized or not.

This law is also true in special relativity.    with regards to fast or slow objects, it depends on their mass. for objects of the same mass the faster object has the most momentum. for object of differing mass, the object with the highest mass x velocity product has the highest mass    A question that you may wish to consider is if you are walking you have mass and velocity, therefore you have momentum - what happens to your momentum when you stop walking ?

0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	Biogenesis.    Edit: Abiogenesis in itself means "generation without life" - it's used to designate a generative physical process which doesn't involve life, in contrast to biogenesis. The theory of the chemical origin of life is often called "abiogenesis" for short since it's obviously an abiogenic process, but that's not the only context in which it's used. To be accurate, that use should be "the abiogenesis of life" but people who frequently debate the origins of life get used to just calling it "abiogenesis" for short. Or maybe they just don't know any better. The non-Creationist abiogenesis/biogenesis question most often comes up with respect to hydrocarbons in geology or planetary or atmospheric science, for example the recent measurement of noticeable methane levels on Mars. It's unclear whether that's biogenic or abiogenic methane, since abiotic processes can generate fairly complex hydrocarbons, at least with low yields.|`|NIb8zWEHaa	spontaneous generation         for sure   biogenesis means organic evolution and not at any cost mean abiogenesis beware|`|h4wNRqf9aa	how does "life from life" (biogenesis) equal tot he origin of life?    it's turtles all the way down!          panspermia in addition to the above anser    nothing other than abiogenesis (and sometimes panspermia, because it does still leave some things open) is highly looked upon by scientists and probable|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	> What are alternatives to abiogenesis?

You might say biogenesis is its antithesis, though not quite its alternative, because the concept of biogenesis says nothing of the ORIGINS of life, only it's perpetuation. There seems to be no means by which living systems could arise naturalistically without first having been non-living. (It's important to keep in mind: we're all non-living at a small enough scale. We're made of the same basic stuff as everything else, living or not.)    Therefore, given that we're talking SCIENCE here (rather than mythology, for instance), my answer would be: there are no alternatives to abiogenesis.

YYLybWHSaa	Genes are lined up along a chromosome like houses on a block. Each gene has an exact address or locus. Alleles are the different forms that can occupy the locus. When chromosomes pair up they align each matching all the loci even if the alleles occupying the address are different.  We can find many alleles that seem to produce similar phenotypes but are they alleles from the same locus or are they just very similar results but really from separate loci in the same pathway.  The question is are the recessive mutations one locus or two loci in one pathway.    Two sequential steps in one pathway A-> B -> C => phenotype    Are these both recessive alleles for step  A-> B  OR  Is it a recessive allele to step A-> B and another to step B->C      Cross breeding to see if the functions of two successive recessive alleles restored full function was needed. If these two pathway steps are the result from duplicated genes that have evolved to share the original job  cross breeding is a good check to be sure the alleles are assigned to the correct loci.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementa...    Complementation model  http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v3/n11...  Paralogs are from genes that duplicated so their alleles would have very similar sequences.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplic...|`|NIb8zWEHaa	Genes contain information about a specific characteristic or trait and can either be dominant or recessive. Genes are found on chromosomes and each gene has a designated place on every chromosome, called a locus. Not all copies of a gene are identical and alternative forms of a gene, called alleles, lead to the alternative form of a trait. Alleles are a way of identifying the two members of a gene pair which produce opposite contrasting phenotypes. An allele of a gene is it's partner gene, for example b is an allele of B and vice versa. When the alleles are identical, the individual is homozygous for that trait. While if the pair is made of two different alleles, the individual is heterozygous. A homozygous pair of can be either dominant (AA, BB) or recessive (aa, bb). Heterozygous pairs are made up of one dominant and one recessive allele (Aa, Bb). In heterozygous individuals only one allele, the dominant, gains expression while the other allele, the recessive, is hidden but still present. Capital letters represent dominant genes and lower case letters, recessive genes. The word genotype is was created to identify genes of an individual and phenotype for the expression of the trait and genes. Phenotype and genotype are terms used to describe the difference between the visible expression of the trait vs. the actual gene makeup. An individual which expresses a dominant trait may carry a recessive allele, but the recessive expression is hidden by it's dominant partner.|`|zkgEm9y7aa	A gene is a section of DNA which codes for a certain chacteristic, such as height in plants. Genes, however can have variations and this is where alleles come in. Alleles are different versions of a gene. For example, a tall allele or a short allele. They are the different sequences of bases in DNA that result in determining a single characteristic. They occur in pairs and can be classified as recssive or dominant.

Meaning that 1 angle is 30, 1 is 60... etc.  The lengths of the sides of these triangles are ALWAYS in the same ratio.<br>  <br>  The side across from the 90o angle (the hypotenuse) is 2, the side across from the 30o angle (short leg) is 1, and the side across from the 60o angle (long leg) is √3 (or 1.73).  In the example they were giving<br>  <br>  y/x ∝(proportional to) 1/√3  or 1/1.73<br>  <br>  therefore the similar triangle will have the same proportion and therefore<br>  <br>  dy/dx ∝(proportional to) y/x ∝(proportional to) 1/√3 or 1/1.73<br>  <br>  <br>  That is something you learn in trig (the triangle bit) and you'll need a lot more trig throughout calculus, but you can learn as you go if you need to.

The only way a number cubed can be positive is if we started with a positive number.  And the only way a number cubed can be negative is if we started with a negative number.  So, we get:<br>  <br>  x = Cube root of 4 or x = -1<br>  <br>  An alternate way to do this is to substitute in x^3 into the factored equation:<br>  <br>  (x^3 - 4) (x^3 + 1) = 0<br>  <br>  We have a difference of non-cubes in the left factor, which can't be factored.  We have a sum of cubes on the right.  You can use the identity:  x^3 + 1 = (x + 1) (x^2 - x + 1) to get<br>  <br>  (x^3 - 4)(x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1) = 0<br>  <br>  The first term has the solution x = cube root of 4, like before.  The second term has the solution x = -1.  The last term has no solution.  There are no two numbers that multiply to give +1 (the constant term) that also give a sum of -1 (the linear coefficient).  Or, alternately, you can use the quadratic formula to see it has no real roots.

The group used Planet X to "predict" the end-of-the-world of 2003. They had a book out on why Planet X was going to cause the end-of-the-world and on how to survive the end-of-the-world.    Apparently, some of us managed to survive 2003 without even buying their book.    Shame, isn't it (at least, that is what their accountant said).    So they published a new version, changed the date to 2012, added features from other fictitious bodies (like Nibiru and Nemesis). They even made fake "documentaries" for television and YouTube.    Their marketing is much better for 2012 than it was for 2003.    But it is still fake.    Even the aliens around Zeta Reticuli;   fake.    ---    The next asteroid big enough to cause damage is not due until 2048.  It is called 2007 VK184.  It has "only" a 99.97% chance of missing us.  Some people are worried about the 0.03% (and that is why we will get more observations in order to calculate a more precise orbit)    Asteroids coming in 2012:    2008 JD33   close pass on 18 February 2012 (8 m across = 25 feet)   1 chance in 20 million of hitting; 99.999995% of missing.    2008 VB4    close pass on 11 August 2012 (8 m across = 25 feet)   1 chance in 285,700,000 of hitting, that means it has 99.9999997% chance of missing.    2008 EM68  This one passes close to Earth very often.  In 2012 there are two passes listed, both in September (6 and 11), each one showing 1 chance in 66 million of hitting.  It measures 10 m across (33 feet)    2008 VL  28 October 2012.  Size = 8 m (25 feet)  1 chance in 1.5 BILLION of hitting.      Asteroid 10 m or less would probably burn up before reaching the ground, but, if it is particularly hard, it could make it to the ground and damage a house (yes, it could kill a person with a direct hit).    ---    2008 VS54  three close passes in 2012 (one in Feb. two in Nov.)  1 chance in 70 million of hitting.  size = 48 m (157 feet)    2005 TM173  16 Dec. 2012 (getting close to "the" date!)  1 chance in 384 million; size = 51 m (167 feet)      2006 FW33  close pass on 2 Nov. 2012 (79 m = 260 feet)  1 chance in 222,000,000 of hitting; 99.9999996% of missing.

It all started when Dr. Robert Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory has some theories about the probable existence of Planet X. Some years later, he left for an expedition to New Zealand from which he believed to be the best place to observe it. After some months of research and observation, he died from a mysterious cancer shortly before announcing his findings. The whole story died with him, and if you look for official information on Dr. Harrington, you will read that he had already discarded the possibility of this planet a few years before their dispatch.    After some years, in 1997, has surged a comet that became famous as the Great Comet of 1997, the Hale-Bopp. Many people believed that this comet was on a collision course with our planet, and even for some time the space observatories were worried, because it really became very close to Earth. Indeed, if he had been here 3 months before, the possibility of a direct collision would be very large. Many comments were made on the comet, and even mysterious about the lack of official information and photos from space agencies regarding it, many other independent and amateur astronomers began to make comments on their own. One independent astronomers photographed what appeared to be a "company" of the comet. According to this picture, it would be a much larger company. This photo was discussed in the Art Bell's radio program, a major critic of NASA and well known in the United States. Few days later, 38 people from a sect called "Heaven's Gate" was found dead by suicide in a house. According to official information, they committed suicide so they could reach such company of the comet, which they believed to be a spaceship that would get them. But the real story was not that well.    Once the news of these deaths cames, Art Bell was blamed by the media to have disclosed to this picture and hence the death of those people, and soon after the NASA confirmed that the photo was false, and that had been manipulated by the person that delivered it to Art Bell. That was a big hit on their behalf, and unfortunately he has not been able to defend itself, since he died of the same mysterious cancer that killed the scientist Robert Harrington. But the photo was genuine, and this whole scheme had been manipulated by NASA and the U.S. department of defense. The "disciples" of the sect were not really religious or anything like that, they were systems developers, and were creating a system of encryption and firewall that even the computers of the office of U.S. defense could break. Were killed one by one in the house where they were found, one after another while going inside. Pictures of the comet and his company were left at the crime scene, and a fake site was created immediately about them. And from there, the whole scheme was created in 2012, because those pictures and information regarding the comet were true, and many other more important things could still be found.    After some years, the name zetatalk appeared on the Internet, according to its creator, Nancy-some-thing, she received telepatic messages from extra-terrestrial beings, which in 2003 warned that a large planet known to us as Nibiru was coming to our Solar System, and would bring with it the apocalypse. Many books and DVDs were sold on the subject for this site. Some time later, Mark Hazzlewood released books on the same subject using data taken from the site zetatalk but eliminating the telepathic contact with aliens to make the story easier.     Many other books and DVDs were sold by him. Of course nothing happened, and now these same people returned to their sites and their books, but this time with a new date: 2012, the year in which the Mayan calendar "ends" and when the holy city of Shamballa would make visible again. It is logical that it is the same campaign which took place earlier. And in that gap of time between 2003 and 2012, much material came from the Internet, and I believe that over 90% came from zetatalk's site and from informations from Mark Hazzlewood's books. The curious thing is that the creator of zetatalk is married to an important person of NASA, and that Mark Hazzlewood moved in with his girlfriend to Canada to get rid of charges related to his books.    Before we go back to the issues of the comet Hale-Bopp and the Planet X, it is important that you know of some studies that were originally developed by Belikovsi and since the 1970s are being performed by Dr. James McCanney. In this model, other than the current model used by scientists to understand the mechanics of celestial bodies, there is what he calls "Electrical Space", where intense interactions of electromagnetic order occurs between them. In this model, although all the theory applied physics is exactly like the current, the electromagnetic interactions between the different celestial bodies count as much of the calculations to be made, not only the

Science is a work in progress...and always refines as data becomes available unlike fundamentalist religion/practitioners that reject  any and all data in favor of faith if there is ever a disagreement.

Theory in science doesn't mean idea, it means a conclusive body of evidence that's supported by all the evidence, has nothing contradicting it, makes testable predictions, can be tested, and is falsifiable.  In science, a theory trumps everything else - it's better than a fact, than a law, than an observation.  A theory CONTAINS facts and laws and observations.

But, even after all this  time, Evolution has not been proven.  The basic principles are known, but no one has actually seen evolution occur on a large scale.  Fortunately, the Theory of Evolution, is still a Theory, because that means it can still be modified by observation and analysis, even though all observations fit the Theory.     It's like the Theory of Relativity.  Even after Einstein proposed it and it has been analyzed and appears to be provable mathematically, it cannot be absolutely proven because of problems demonstrating it.|`|VqKHo47haa	Well evolution should be a law. But as far as biology goes, there arent many laws, there are lots and lots of theories. But biology is not like chemistry or physics, you're dealing with systems that are much harder to manipulate. Physics and chemistry experiments can be controlled, systems can be confined, biology is not like that (though it is getting close to that). There are laws of physics, like the LAW of gravity, and the LAW of electromagnetism, the 3 LAWS of thermodynamics; but these topics lend themselves to mathematical explanation very easily, which is why they are easy to prove. A difference between a law and a theory is that for a theory to become a law, it has to be observed for for millenniums without being violated. Laws are observed, they are not "constructed", equations and theories can be derived from laws, but a law can never be derived from such. A theory's ultimate test, the one it must pass to become a law, is that of time. Once us humans are around long enough to see ourselves evolve, Im sure everybody will start talking about the Law of Evolution. But unfortunately the way things are going, I doubt that will happen. Other aspects to biology should be considered law as well.     So much of biological research is based on principles that have been derived and observed from other principles, its impossible to say that everything in biology is a theory. How would we have cures for diseases, and simple things like aspirin, if it were not for biological theories that have been proven so well that they should be laws?|`|MnGKdWTpaa	Because Christians are stupid|`|sc5shXOsaa	Religion|`|eWMn7dhKaa	You feel like paying to change the wordings in all those text and reference books?|`|IrnHxv0iaa	Not necessarily,the religious aspects of how humans were created is still in play....remember the world was created on religious bounds.So there are people who want allow that theory to be a fact until it can actuaslly be proved.|`|4zu47qncaa	same reason gravity is still a theory, cant be proven inconclusively.  im not saying evolution should be a theory but i can understand why it cant be a law and im NOT saying creationism is fact|`|WSYVIwXcaa	Regardless of whether or not religious views come into play, if you look at time lines AND believe in an old earth, there is still not enough time for evolution to have occurred to the magnitude that the earth is developed.
uHe4AV6Laa	A mutation is a change in the genetic material of a cell, or of a virus. There are two kinds of mutation, somatic mutation and germ-line mutation.     Somatic mutation affects non-reproductive cells. It is usually harmless, except in the case of mutations which cause uncontrolled reproduction of the affected cell --- that is, cancer. Besides that, there is very little that one cell, however strangely mutated, can do to harm your body.     Germ-line mutation affects reproductive cells --- in animals, sperm or ova --- and so will be present in every cell of the body of an animal formed from the union of such a sperm or such an ovum.     Germ-line mutations are of great importance in biology because the theory of evolution accounts for evolution by the cumulative effect of a sequence of small random germ-line mutations each of which, if favored by natural selection, becomes prevalent in the gene-pool in which the mutation takes place.

FY4cCjsOaa	There are 9 positions in any arrangement.    Since the 3 vowels must all be separate, how many ways can they be placed? List possible positions for the first two, and count how many places the third can take:  1, 3, 5-9 (5 arrangements)  1, 4, 6-9 (4)  1, 5, 7-9 (3)  1, 6, 8-9 (2)  1, 7, 9 (1)  So with a vowel in position 1, there are 1+2+3+4+5 = 15  2, 4, 6-9 (4)  and we can now see that with the first vowel in position 2, we'll get  1+2+3+4 = 10 arrangements. In fact, the number of possible positionings with the first vowel in any given spot N is the triangular number of order 9-N-3. (The first vowel has to appear no later than position 5.)    So we can just add up the triangular numbers of order 1 through 5:  1+3+6+10+15 = 35    So there are   35 possible positions of the three vowels,  3! possible arrangements of I, A, E among any three vowel positions, and  6! possible arrangements of the six consonants among the remaining positions.  35 * 3! * 6! = 35 * 6 * 720 = 151,200

cHhEC9fpaa	The proton rest mass is approximately 1.6726  10-27 kg. Einstein's formula E = m c^2, expresses the equivalence between mass (m) and energy (E), where c is the speed of light.    This gives E = 1.5033 x 10-10 joules = 15.033 nano joules.    The electron volt is defined as the energy acquired when a charge of one electron is accelerated across a potential of 1 volt so that 1 electron volt = 1.602x10-19 joule.    Thus E = 1.5033 x 10-10 joule/(1.602x10-19 joule/eV) = 938.3 MeV.|`|rsTB7D1zaa	These other posts are correct.  Just like to add that the eV is a unit of energy, as you have properly used here.    You will often hear of people talking about MASS in terms of eV.  This is just being lazy.  The unit of mass in eV / c^2.  That is, by E=mc^2, you need to divide energy by c^2 to get a mass.  But we commonly say that the proton has a REST MASS of 938MeV, we really mean a rest mass of 938 MeV/c^2.  This is convenient, however, because if you can get particles up to 1GeV then you know there could be some proton interactions going on.|`|7TMXaK87aa	Units?

78b3d834e72deac7083fdd58233b5cbfaa	CO2 is 30% higher than it has been for 650,000 years. Methane is 130% greater. These are two of the main pollutants humans put into the atmosphere in excess, and they are two of the primary greenhouse gases.    Look at the 'hockeystick', which shows a dramatic warming since 1950 after a fairly stable climate for 1000 years. In fact, the 10 hottest years in recorded history have all happened since 1990, with 2005 being the hottest.  (see links below)    How's that for proof of man's fault in this? There is ample proof, any real scientist will tell you that.    There has NEVER been an article doubting man's influence on global warming published in a peer-reviewed journal. A recent study of almost 1000 proved that.    Yes, the earth naturally heats and cools, but the rate and amount we are warming now is unprecedented in the recent geologic past. We are doing this, and we must stop it. This is not some political statement or rhetoric. This is science trying to educate a crass, ignorant public of the damage they are doing. The magnitude of temperature increase ALREADY is about 10x that of the 'little ice age' of the middle ages, and rate and amount are only going up.    Just to be clear, glacial and interglacial cycles are mainly controlled by astronomical fluctuations, but we have a detailed record of the last 7 cycles, and what the climate and CO2 is doing now is way different and extreme. The rate of increase is much higher than in the past AND the value itself is much higher.|`|RjUWPz5daa	Why not consider that it's a big fantasy that has been created to redistribute wealth.

Carbon Dioxide from Buildings   Buildings structure account for about 12% of carbon dioxide emissions.    Carbon Dioxide from Airplanes  The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that aviation causes 3.5 percent of global warming, and that the figure could rise to 15 percent by 2050.    Nitrous oxide   Another greenhouse gas is Nitrous oxide (N2O), a colourless, non-flammable gas with a sweetish odour, commonly known as "laughing gas", and sometimes used as an anaesthetic. Nitrous oxide is naturally produced by oceans and rainforests. Man-made sources of nitrous oxide include nylon and nitric acid production, the use of fertilisers in agriculture, cars with catalytic converters and the burning of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is broken down in the atmosphere by chemical reactions that involve sunlight.     Deforestation   After carbon emissions caused by humans, deforestation is the second principle cause of atmospheric carbn dioxide. (NASA Web Site) Deforestation is responsible for 20-25% of all carbon emissions entering the atmosphere, by the burning and cutting of about 34 million acres of trees each year. We are losing millions of acres of rainforests each year, the equivalent in area to the size of Italy. [22] The destroying of tropical forests alone is throwing hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. We are also losing temperate forests. The temperate forests of the world account for an absorption rate of 2 billion tons of carbon annually. [3] In the temperate forests of Siberia alone, the earth is losing 10 million acres per year.  2 days ago - Edit - Delete   Source(s):  Eco Bridge

Scientists don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen in the year 2012, or specifically on the date December 21, other than the solstice, which happens every year.    None of the "predicted" happenings for 2012 hold up under close scrutiny. "Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist.

wJTsifugaa	If you work in a laboratory that supports the operation of a plant, be it a chemical plant or a power plant, that will be a great application of chemical knowledge.  You have to know about the how the plant works and then interpret the lab results to recommend how to make the plant operation better.    Another career path is chemical engineering.  You will concentrate on how to apply chemical processes to the real world, there is less emphasis on what happens in a beaker.  That does involve more school but it may be worth it.
f0WUWKDraa	from the ideal gas laws, pressure is proportional to temperature (for constant volume and mass of gas) :  p1/p2  = T1/T2    the correct temperature to use is the Kelvin scale, which is the same as Centigrade except you add 273 when converting from C to K. (so eg 0 degC is 273 K and 100 degC is 373 K.)    i guess the "overpressure" means how much above atmospheric pressure the tyre pressure is.    so (using X for the required overpressure) :   (X+1.000) / (2.050+1.000) = (273-5) / (273+25) = 268 / 298   (X+1) = 3.050 x 268 / 298 = 2.743  X = 1.743 atm.

pffEqA9aaa	The rate is dictated by the difference between the water's surrounding environment.  In other words if a cup of hot water is placed in a cold room it will cool down quickly, if it's placed in a warm place it will stay "hot" longer.    The reason the cooling down seams not uniform is because as the water gets cooler, the temperature difference between it and the surrounding environment becomes smaller (thereby slowing the cooling).

They're just a consequence of a galaxy not a reason.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Dr. Bob's answer is very good. I'd just add the idea that modeling galaxy motions is like fluid mechanics convoluted with general relativity. The mass creates a depth of potential energy, and the stars act like particles accelerating in response to the perceived gradient in that potential. Each particle has its own potential well, but there's also a collective potential well that dominates whenever none of the individual particles is nearby.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Unable to see far enough out to tell.|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	black holes that sit in every galatic core|`|5al0K3N0aa	The stars that make up a galaxy orbit the supermassive black hole at the centre of that galaxy. It is likely that all galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres.     The link below takes you to ESO's (European Southern Observatory) website where you can see a movie that they have made by taking images through one of their very large telescopes of the space near the centre of our Galaxy.     http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/Videos/Star...    You can see the stars very near the centre orbiting the supermassive black hole (which obviously you can't see).    Galaxies themselves are part of clusters. Where typically there are maybe 20 - 60 galaxies ranging from small irregular ones to huge spiral and elliptical shaped galaxies. The galaxies in a cluster move about using the same gravity laws as orbits, but they don't really orbit anything.     Clusters of galaxies then form super-clusters of galaxies with literally thousand to hundreds of thousands of galaxies.     Our Milky Way for example is in a cluster we call The Local Group; our Local Group is then gravitationally part of the Coma-Virgo Cluster (a super-cluster) of galaxies.      Go here to see a 3D image of the distribution of galaxy clusters.    http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/Videos/Gala...    Sometimes galaxies crash into one another. This process is thought to lead to spiral galaxies forming elliptical shaped ones. For example, the Andromeda Galaxy is our closest big galaxy, and the largest in our Local Group is heading toward the Milky Way. The two galaxies will interact in a few billion years from now (so don't worry about it too much).|`|mmWeBRRtaa	In the broadest sense, nothing orbits anything!  "Orbit" is a word we use in order to brush aside the complexities of actual motion.  Every body moving through space (which is curved by gravity) follows the path of least resistance (known as a geodesic in spacetime).    If the motion of a body through space is almost exactly periodic (such as the motion of the earth around the sun, with minor perturbations from the planets) or quasi-periodic (the sun's motion about the center of the galaxy, along with vertical oscillations which have a different periodicity), we call it an orbit.    We can say that the stars of the Milky Way orbit about the center of the galaxy, but we would never say that the Milky Way orbits about its own center.    The classical elliptical motion you think of as an orbit occurs when you have many bodies moving about a much larger body (such as the planets around the sun) or two bodies moving about each other (such as a binary star).  Once you have more than two bodies of comparable mass, the motion becomes very complex.  In every case (except when there's a collision), each body follows a geodesic, but the motion of multiple bodies has a chaotic appearance.  Kepler and Newton solved the two-body problem hundreds of years ago, but tracking three or more bodies requires a numerical integration over time; there is no simple formula like the equation of an ellipse.    Galaxies are often found in clusters -- sometimes large, sometimes small. But there's an additional complication here:  When you think about the earth and sun, each body is small compared to the distance between them.  Galaxies in clusters, on the other hand, are relatively large compared to inter-galactic distances, so galaxies can be tidally distorted by nearby galaxies.  (They can also merge.  It's thought that elliptical galaxies form by the merger of galaxies, so the number of spiral galaxies in the universe diminishes over time.)    The bottom line is that the motion of galaxies is complex.  When you think about a small galaxy near a large one (such as the Magellanic clouds near the Milky Way), you might imagine that it orbits about the larger galaxy, but it's a more complex situation than planetary motions, and galaxies do not always maintain stable shapes as do the earth and sun.  In a large cluster of galaxies (like the Virgo or Coma clusters), the motions should be very complex, but in a way that keeps most galaxies bound to the cluster.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Central black holes, and each-other.

AA6Aq94vaa	There are a bunch of landforms that are either directly formed by glaciers or somehow affected by them  Till, a clay-like sediment with many rocks and boulders in it, and is deposited directly by the glacier   Outwash: a sediment containing mostly sand, silt and gravel and is deposited by meltwater from the glacier   Drumlin: a small streamlined hill made of till   Morraines: a hilly area showing how far a glacier has gone.    Terninal morraine shows the furthest extent of glaciation, a recessional morraine show where a glacier has advanced after it has retreated somewhat   Morraines are made of till  Esker: a long narrow hill made of outwash, it shows where a river ran under a glacier, they can extend for miles  Kame: a small cone shaped hill made of outwash, formed by water running down a hole in the glacier   Glacial Lake bed: an area which was a former glacial lake. A Glacial lake is formed by meltwater from the glacier and kept in place by an ice dam, when the ice dam melts the glacial lake flows away in a great torrent. Glacial lake beds are where the sediment is deposited on the bottom of a glacial lake  Kame delta: a delta formed by braided streams from a melting glacier, they are made of outwash  Cirque: a rounded out hole in a mountain, and is where an alpine glacier is formed   arrete, a thin ridge between two cirques   U-Shaped Valley: a valley created by the path of an alpine glacier  Rouche Montanee  (sp?) The side of a hill or mountain opposite from an advancing glacier (in the northern hemisphere this would most like be the south side of the hill) The glacier plucks out rock from that side of the hill leaving a cliff on that side.  Outwash plain: It is the area just beyond the furthest advance of the glacier, it is created by deposits left by braided streams from melting glaciers. As it's name suggest, it is made of outwash  Kettle pond: a pond that was formed by a large chunk of ice that broke off the glacier and was carried by meltwater to its current place on the outwash plain. There is less sediment there so a depression forms. Later it fills up with water.   If no water fills up the kettle then it is called a "Keg"   Striations: grooves on bedrock where the glacier carried a rock and dragged it along the bedrock. Striations always show the direction in which the glacier moved.   Erratic: a rock plucked by a glacier and deposited in a new place. It is often different from the bedrock in the place it was deposited in.

Sometimes several different 3 dimensional hypotheses are scored about equally, and the perception is a rapid flutter between those possibilities, and sometimes no reasonable hypothesis presents itself and the perception loses 3d, altogether.

Simply having a high level of acuity is insufficient, if say you had only one eye.    Nature's way of solving this problem was the evolution of binocular vision:  with visual cues from a single source arriving at two receptors (your retinas), your brain does the processing that allows a person to sense the different distances to objects in your field of view as depth.    The same principle is applied in such optical devices as rangefinders and robotic vision systems.    The military has also investigated the use of such passive optical methods for determining target range in fuze/warhead design for airborne missiles.

Sure, listen to what anybody else wants to tell you - but if there's no fossil evidence for it, there's no sense in believing it. Yes, if it were possible for complex genes to appear over generations in the correct sequence to add useful features, then perhaps it would be possible. But there's no solid biological evidence for that, and all statistical evidence says that species lose genes far faster than they could ever gain them.    They'd need limbs, lungs, eye modifications, adequate ways to breathe into their new lungs, skin modifications to allow for extended atmosphere exposure - and prey, which would also need the same modifications. Unless it were to live by hunting itself, which would be a disaster. And it would need all of these without any of them getting bred out in the process of breeding these changes in, every change being useful and not harmful - against all statistical evidence.  And all this happened without fossils to prove it. Amazing, huh?    Even if it were possible over millions of years, we'd have examples. Not missing links.

There are numerous advances that have to be made.  You can look at a lung fish for clues how it might of happened for just one feature.  Keep in mind that numerous adaptations have to take place simultaneously.  The lung fish evolved in an environment where water dried up.  They needed to find a way to survive until the next flood.  They came up with a primitive lung which is an adaptation of their swim bladder, used for boyancy.  This helped them cope with low oxygen conditions in warm water and to survive in the mud when water was running out.  Current species can even survive in the cocoon like vessels they create in the mud to await the next wet season.  After developing the lung which was evolved to deal with low oxygen and drying conditions, it is easy to see how this sort of creature may have been able to move to an amphibious type of niche.

We can see clues as to how it happened in nature today, such as in amphibious creatures. Take the lungfish; They can breath air, and survive seasonal drying out of waterholes by burying themselves in mud and slowing down their metabolism. When the rains come they will climb out of the mud and make their way over land to find water using its lobed fins.   Fossil examples of lungfish show relatively little difference from the modern species. It hasn't evolved much in millions of years because it has already perfectly adapted to its environment.    We have plenty fossil evidence for this change, despite what the guy above says, just as we now have a complete fossil record for whales, mammals which once lived on land then returned to the sea. Creation theorists forget that in order for a creatures remains to become a fossil, a very precise set of conditions are required.

There have been countless cases where the twins are eerily similar despite being separated.  So the answer to your question is YES.|`|4zspYrGXaa	What most of the "Naysayers" are really arguing about does ESP really exist?  What they fail to realize is that there is a ton of research out there with long term studies and they all state that "Twins" do communicate utilizing an unknown method "...most likely ESP.  So, if twins can, isn't it reasonable to believe that others may be able to also? Yes.    Come on folks lets be honest. There are things out in life we don't totally understand as yet.  Like UFOs are simply "unidentified flying objects" give it a rest. If you need proof go investigate. ESP is simply extra[meaning out of] sensory [touch] perception.  It happens and just like the existence of the wind... you can't see it but it exists. [Please don't write back that you can prove the wind exists... dah! I know that...this is just an analogy to explain what I mean.] You see ESP exists and can be proved by researchers {Rhine, Braud, Schmidt, Targ, Tart, Puthoff, etc...all well respected scientists} and those who have it do "know" that it exists.

You could use magnetostrictive sensing to check and see that the egg was still whole, seat belts wrapped around it to help dull the impact (or use seat belts to lower it from the height), and have it trigger an air bag on its way down, so the bad is already inflated and beginning to deflate once the egg hits it (so the force from the air bag doesn't break it).|`|A41l25X3aa	Are you talking about the car as a whole or just the air bag? If it were just the air bag,you could set it on the ground and time it so it inflates,reaches max inflation and starts to deflate before the egg lands, allowing for a cusioned landing. If you inflated it to the max at the same time the egg landed,the bag would be too stiff, causing the egg to break
8Y7LQ6TGaa	asking "why" of something in the quantum mechanics world is futile. Even to try to understand "how" or "what" is almost impossible for normal humans, let alone "why".    read the reference.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	Why questions are extraordinarily difficult to answer.  Even if someone can give a semi-explanation, you can always keep asking why until there is none.  Every two-year old (or parent of one) knows this.  And insofar as semi-explanations of quantum phenomena appeal to our classical intuition, which is honed in classical mechanics, they are bound to be misleading.  The fact that you describe the electron as "spinning" just because we say it has "spin" means that you have already been somewhat misled.  The electron is, as best we can tell, a point particle.  It can't spin in any way you can imagine.  It just has an intrinsic angular momentum.    How we discovered it is only slightly more straightforward.  A bunch of scientists in the 20s proposed spin as the answer to some unexplained phenomena--foremost among them the Zeeman effect.  When you apply a magnetic field to an atom, you often get a splitting of energy levels, and hence a splitting of spectral lines.  This is nicely explained by supposing that the atom has an angular momentum and hence a magnetic moment.  We knew about orbital angular momentum.  But it turns out that you can't explain all the splitting with orbital angular momentum alone.  You need the electron to have its own intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum--which we naturally called spin.|`|2gjfFsYKaa	Because electrons orbit the nucleus, they have "orbital" angular momentum. It was then discovered that electrons also have another type of angular momentum. Because it was first thought that this angular momentum was like a globe spinning on its axis, it was called "spin." However, we now know that the electron has no physical structure and does not spin like a globe and "spin" is just the casual term for what is more properly called "intrinsic angular momentum." So, your second question can't be answered. For more information, see the reference..
AA11058044	From the environmental evidence, Arctodus was a open-prairie species, inhabiting the vast grasslands that covered most of the western part of the continent (and are now more than 99% farmland).    The chances of a population of huge bears, up to 6' at the shoulder, which were predatory, and probably chased down their prey and lived out in open country remaining undetected for 10,000 years is extremely remote.    If they did exist, cows would be like potato chips to them, and there's virtually no chance that ranchers would have missed something like that taking down their stock.

If you lump them together indiscriminately, it's not a great sign that you'll be able to even understand the answers you're asking for.      2)  The first life appearing is abiogenesis, not evolution.  You can completely accept evolution and still believe some god created life to begin with, because evolution says NOTHING about where the life came from.    3)  The human race has been around about 200,000 year in our current form, or close to it.  There's no a simple method for determining how many people used to live on Earth at a certain time - plagues, disasters, volcanos, earthquakes, ice ages do a good job of trimming the population for us.    4)  Species do not change into different species in one generation.  A good definition of two animals of different species are those that can't reproduce with each other.  Look up ring species - like a circle of evolution, the ones near each other can reproduce but not ones on the other side of the circle.      5)  We did not evolve from monkeys.  Monkeys and humans evolved from a common ancestor.  You're related to your cousin - but that doesn't mean you evolved from him.  You have a common ancestor in your grandparents.  Why isn't your cousin you, or turning into you?  He went one way, you went the other.  You can't become each other.      6)  Most mutations are harmless, neither good nor bad.  The small things that make most people different from their parents are the result of mutations that don't kill them or really help them in any way.  Get a bad one, and you die and don't spread it around.  Get a good one, and it will spread into the population.    7)  You think wrong.    8)  Yes, stars explode.  The Earth formed from a solar nebula about 5 billion years ago.  It contains the remnants of supernovae explosions that enriched it with carbon, oxygen, silicon, and all the other elements that make the Earth. There are 200 billion stars in our galaxy alone, billions of galaxies, planets around most of the stars, and large regions planets could exist in that could allow for life to form.  We're not at 'just the right distance', the Earth moves about 2 million miles closer and further from the Sun in just one orbit.  We could be almost as far away as Mars, or almost as close as Venus, and still support life.    9)  No, the big bang didn't explode.    Frankly, since you posted this with so little understanding of science in general and these fields in specific, I'm sure you're not still reading this or understanding it.  It's for all the other people who might be reading this and still have a few brain cells left they didn't kill by hitting themselves with a bible every morning.|`|stAeoUeSaa	You are correct.

Also the fact that our red blood cells have no DNa and God said I breathed life into man and he became a living being, and the life is in the blood, of course red cells carry oxygen giving life to the body.  this explains well what sparked life in us.  have you checked out oopart(out of place artifacts) on you tube they have a few videos that show some strange things, one of many is a find man made that according to science should be hundreds of millions years old. Now that and other things make us look at our info about how old the earth is they measure it by rock formation, yet good evidence is coming forward that strata build up can happen very quickly, if say a flood was to happen it could happen in weeks not billions of years, so if that is wrong then we started with a false premise and have been building on folly.  also the many artifacts showing dino's and dino's found with flesh etc etc it goes on, Some of it is ignored and some just not talked about, bad science if you ask me.

Cells don't come from the dividing of other cells. For example single celled organisms are known to exist in vast quantities. They are built up from the sub-cell structure into the cells themselves; they don't come from 'the dividing' of other cells.    I think you mean geology (rather than genealogy - which is the study of people's heritage like tracing their family tree). Evolution is not used to describe the age of Earth, that is biology again. But Earth has close to seven billion people about now. What math exactly did you use to determine that humans had to be around for millions of years?    Another thing that shows people's real lack of understanding of evolution is the belief that we evolved from monkeys. That is complete nonsense; what evolution actually says is that monkeys (apes to be fair) and humans have a common ancestor.     And your understanding of the Big Bang is also not brilliant. The Universe came into existence during the Big Bang and has been evolving ever since.    I wonder; do you study or have you ever studied science? And also, the calculations you claim to be easy; unless you have studied some pretty advanced statistics, then you'll be unable to accurately compute the answers. I doubt this as your general level of science knowledge seems to be about the average; which is pretty poor.     Further, I wonder why you feel the need to say science is nonsense in order to prove the existence of God. Absolutely nothing in science disproves the existence of God. And fundamental religious principles do not go against anything science has to say about life and the Universe.     I'd suggest that before you post a question like this onto a science thread that you check through your basic facts first, and make sure you at least have an understanding of what a subject is. Calling the subject of the history and evolution of Earth 'genealogy' shows your utter complete ignorance for the subject.     Do not post such arrogant material about a subject you know so little and understand so little about in a place like this.

However, as more and more evidence piled up, only very convinced atheists (like Fred Hoyle) continued to fight it.      That has not changed.    ---    Anyone who studies chemistry knows that atoms do not combine at random.  As soon as molecules become bigger, they have polarized spots around them.  This makes it easier for other, similar molecules, to take position close to them... or not, depending on the patterns of the polarity spots.    This is exactly how enzymes (which are not living molecules) distinguish one molecule from another (like insulin "attracting" glucose).    The fact that proteins can be formed from inert material was proven almost 50 years ago.  In a Christian university.    ---    Combining Evolution and Big Bang in the same question sounds like the kind of thing that would be done by someone from one of them fake American Christian sects who have decided to build a fake religion around "special" interpretations of a translation of an adaptation of the Bible.    These people could have a jolly time of keeping their creepy activities out of the reach of secular laws, if they could only prove that these activities are required by their "religion".    Unfortunately, science gets in the way of their "beliefs".  Therefore, they feel they must attack science.|`|fbeb2b3a6c2e7530b3c5cb36459afcbcaa	well yes organic matter can be created from inorganic compounds  its not like the cells came from nowhere.

Considering the vast size of space and Earth is the only known planet that supports life it doesn't hold well for your improbability theory since from what we know their are billions of planets that dont support life but only ours does which fits your theory that such an occurance must be rare.     The entire question is boiled down to that you find such an idea unbelivable but that is not evidence of anything of which you have none anyway despite numerous evidence showing that during the time the earth has been around different species have lived and died and that humans have been around for a very short amount of that time like it or not that supports evolution went a creature dies out i.e dinosaurs other rise to take their place i.e mamals|`|Jqg7Hvfiaa	No he hasn't, the facts in this are inaccurate.

IUmAflSqaa	By Z5 I'm assuming you mean Z/5Z.  Assuming this, then:    (2+i)(2-i) = 4-i^2 = 4-(-1) = 5 = 0 (mod 5)    And neither 2+i nor 2-i is equal to 0.    How did I come up with this?  Well, Z/5Z already contains two "square roots of -1", namely 2 and 3, since 2^2 = 3^2 = 4 = -1 (mod 5).  In general, in a commutative ring R, if a^2 = b^2 but a  b, then a+b  0, a-b  0, and:    (a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2 = 0    How about units?  Well, every nonzero nonzero-divisor is a unit.  Indeed, let x  0 be in (Z/5Z)[i].  Consider the map:    y |-> xy    This is a group homomorphism, since x(y+z) = xy+xz for all y, z in the ring.  If the kernel is nontrivial, then there is some y in (Z/5Z)[i] so that xy = 0, and hence x is a zero-divisor.  If the kernel is trivial, then the homomorphism is an isomorphism, and there is some y in (Z/5Z)[i] so that xy = 1, hence x is a unit.  So... 1, 2, 3, 4, i, 2i, 3i, 4i are all units.    See if you can show that the units are precisely the elements a+bi such that a^2+b^2  0, while the zero-divisors are the elements such that a^2+b^2 = 0.

U4J22obgaa	As more alkali is added the pH increase. The reason that the curve is a ''S'' is because there is acid in the solution the pH only rises steeply when all the acid is neutralized other wise the increase in pH is reduced by the acid there is no effect on the line.    Lets try another experiment this time we add alkali to pure water not acid, the line in the graph is a steep straight line because now there are no acids in the solution.    The acid is resposible for the ''S'' shape otherwise the curve is not a ''S''  The experiment we tried is the contorl to our hypothesis.|`|aBObYbpCaa	Points of interest.  1. the pH of the acid starts at just above 0, which suggests a strong acid, at 1 mol/dm3  2. As alkali is added the pH graually rises so at equivalence point the graph shows pH 5 which if for a strong acid /strong alkali would be a little low, I would expect it to be 7  3. Since the pH rises to pH 9 instead of pH 14 suggests a weak alkali, maybe aq ammonia?  Why lower than 7 at equivalence point? Because the conjugate acid of the alkali is a weak acid (proton donor to water) e.g.  NH4+aq  + H2O  NH3aq  + H3O+aq   pKa for NH4+ aq is 9.3 (above reaction)|`|QAM3gVs6aa	The top of the curve indicates the alkaline solution, the line continues on like this until you add enough acid to neutralise the alkali. Notice the drop in the pH, this happens when too much acid has been added. You need the right amount of acid to neutralise the alkali this happens at a pH of 0.

96145621c75947c84171b675f275b9cbaa	Total magnification is also dependent upon the tube length of the microscope. Most standard fixed tube length microscopes have a tube length of 160, 170, 200, or 210 millimeters with 160 millimeters being the most common for transmitted light biomedical microscopes. Many industrial microscopes, designed for use in the semiconductor industry, have a tube length of 210 millimeters. The objectives and eyepieces of these microscopes have optical properties designed for a specific tube length, and using an objective or eyepiece in a microscope of different tube length will lead to changes in the magnification factor (and may also lead to an increase in optical aberration lens errors). Infinity-corrected microscopes also have eyepieces and objectives that are optically-tuned to the design of the microscope, and these should not be interchanged between microscopes with different infinity tube lengths.

So, in this case, $25 would turn into .25.    Then, multiply the price of the item by the discount. $40x.25.    When you do this, you get $10. That is the discount. So, then subtract the discount from the regular price.    So, simply:  1. $20=.25  2. $40x.25.  3. $40x.25=$10.  4. $40-$10.  5. $40-$10=$30.    The item is going to be worth $30.

v2Kv13nXaa	For a Pediatrician, you are looking at about 7-8 years of school plus another three years of internship or a residency (four years undergrad and then post-grad) and you also have to take the MCAT tests, which are really hard. You have to take alot more body sciences and chemistry classes, and is actually a much harder undergrad (requires a bachelor of science, which requires about 2 extra math classes, 2 extra physics classes, and 2 extra chemistry classes on top of human anatomy, biochem, etc). Starting salary for a pediatrician  is about 120,000-130,000 and after 3 years 150,000-200,000    Marine Biology would require at least 4 years of undergrad, and post-grad is optional. Starting salaries are about 55,000-90,000, but then again, you will not get yourself as far in debt from school. the undergrad requires alot more natural-science based courses such as ecology, animal and plant sciences, and animal anatomy.

mH1Tnv5Naa	Not really "too cold to snow", but it can be too cold to snow much.  The colder the air is, the less water vapor it can hold.

Actually, arctic regions tend to receive a foot of snow or less annually, and very little during their winter times.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	No. It snowed in MA when it was below zero.|`|dqw1iH6haa	no its not true they said it wasnt on QI :)    snow been recorded at -40 degrees|`|3yzYUbnYaa	Well I don't think it can't snow when it gets cold out.

It is never to cold to snow, the only effect extremely cold temperatures have on snow is that there is little vapor in the air and you won't be seeing as much snow as you would on a 30 degree day. The Artic actually doesn't see much snowfall, but because of the frigid temperatures down there they keep their snow all year round. I think what your meteorologist might have meant was that there was very little snow and due to the cold weather you would hardly see it at all, so in order for any noticeable amount of snow to fall it would have to be a little warmer.    Just my guess.|`|DGbu2x7Faa	All of your answers  explaining the lack of moisture are the correct ones, when snow is blowing it is not snowing, it is snow simply being blown around by the wind, not falling from the sky.

I really don't know how it works, but they don't get that much snow in the arctic.|`|9w6BqpVVaa	That is somewhat true. There isn't necessarily a temperature where it is too cold to snow because obviously it does snow in far northern areas when temps are very low.     The meteorologist says that because usually when very cold air moves in to a region, it is brought on by a cold front of very dry air meaning the humidity is too low for precipitation. The cold air will stay around until a warm front moves in bringing in warm, moist air which can create precipitation. So, yes the temperature usually increases before it snows, especially during large snow storms.|`|mWukMOAeaa	I always thought that was a stupid thing to say. The arctic, exactly! Of course it doesn't have to warm up to snow. I'd love to know who came up with that idea.|`|G4wGCghdaa	Not on the planet I live on. My niece is a TV news anchor I asked this of the highly paid meteorologist she works with. The 3 factors to produce snow. 1- temperature profile that allows snow to reach the surface. 2- saturated air. 3- enough lift to allow snow to form.  Only at artic temps (-40 F) or lower is this somewhat true. But it does happen even at that temperature.    At absolute zero (-459 F) all air which includes water vapor condenses and loses molecular energy which would cause it to be too cold to snow. But I wouldn't want to build snowmen in that weather anyway!

The coefficient of x is the slope of the line, the ratio of the change in y to the change x; in other words, it's the opposite over adjacent for an imaginary right triangle formed by a segment of the line, a segment of the x-axis, and a vertical line joining the two segments.

It is possible that 6x + 4 wound be the measure of an angle but you would have to substitute x = some number to evaluate.  Let us consider the line y = 6x + 4. That line makes an angle with another line. Commonly we look at the angle that it makes with the x-axis. If that is what you want 6 is the tangent of than angle and the angle of inclination.

jKvA9jwzaa	The observations of Hooke, Leeuwenhoek, Schleiden, Schwann, Virchow, and others led to the development of the cell theory. The cell theory is a widely accepted explanation of the relationship between cells and living things. The cell theory states:    All living things are composed of cells.   Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things.   Cells arise from pre-existing cells.   The cell theory holds true for all living things, no matter how big or small, or how simple or complex. Since according to research, cells are common to all living things, they can provide information about all life. And because all cells come from other cells, scientists can study cells to learn about growth, reproduction, and all other functions that living things perform. By learning about cells and how they function, you can learn about all types of living things.    Credit for developing cell theory is usually given to three scientists: Theodor Schwann, Matthias Jakob Schleiden, and Rudolf Virchow. In 1839, Schwann and Schleiden suggested that cells were the basic unit of life. Their theory accepted the first two tenets of modern cell theory. However the cell theory of Schleiden differed from modern cell theory in that it proposed a method of spontaneous crystallization that he called "Free Cell Formation. In 1858, Rudolf Virchow concluded that all cells come from pre-existing cells, thus completing the classical cell theory.|`|bRfLyvPIaa	A common misconception of science is that it's about proving things. But proofs are about math. Science is all about disproving things.

This theory has been tested and challenged over and over and has withstood all challenges. That's why it's now accepted.|`|ozo8UbMeaa	Your question is a part of the cell theory, first proposed by Matthias, Schleiden and Schwann. (also partly Robet Hooke)  Rudolf Virchow first proved cell division.

He opposed spontaneous generation and carried out experiments in the 1850's to show that nematodes do not arise spontaneously.)

Contrails are the by-product of jet turbine engines which expel moisture which is then condensed by cold air which is below the dew point at high altitudes. So, basically they are long, cylindrical clouds that are visible from the ground.    There are some experiments and processes using silver iodide to 'seed' rain clouds.

yzVGwQEwaa	Fruit rots because it is full of energy rich compounds like sugar which many many organisms on earth would love to consume.  Fruit is also designed/produced to be eaten (by the plant) and so tends to be easy to consume when ripe.    The primary gas released will be CO2; carbon dioxide.  This is released during cellular respiration as the sugars and other stuff in the fruit is broken down for energy for the organism doing the eating.  It`s quite possible other gases will come out, but they`d likely have higher potential energy in them than CO2 so it`d be wasteful for the organisms eating the fruit to offgas them.|`|dFQhJgBYaa	You performed some interesting experiments, and I will attempt to provide   you with further explanations of your results. The first thing to remember   is that fruits and vegetables are living organisms. Thus, they are subject   to physical, chemical, and microbiological spoilage from harvest until   consumption. Your experiments involved chemical and microbiological   spoilage but physical damage could have been a contributing factor. Fruit   will continue to respire after harvest. These biochemical changes result in   a breakdown of carbohydrates with the production of carbon dioxide and   methane. Enzymes (i.e pectinases which breakdown the cementing material   between cells) in the fruit also result in softening. Molds, yeasts, and   bacteria associated with the surface or inside of the fruit can also cause   spoilage. All of these changes can occur alone or in combination with each   other. In your experiments in closed containers,some biochemical changes   would occur until the oxygen was used up. Some carbon dioxide and methane   would be produced. Under anaerobic conditions (absence of oxygen),   microorganisms can breakdown sugars to prodcue ethanol and more carbon   dioxide.This process is referred to as fermentation. Did you smell alcohol   when you opened the containers? If you used apples as one of your fruits,   you may also have noticed a vinegar like odor (acetic acid). I hope this   helps to clarify the results from your experiments.  they rot because of some gasses they give off. try usein green bags. i have them and they really work.  Fruit Rots because it's environment (the air around it) is permeated with bacteria. The bacteria lives off the fruit and then multiplies. When these microscopic bacteria have multiplied enough, there are so many of them that you can see them. That's Rot. Keeping it in a cool, air tight environment will slow down the rot but not stop it, because when you get it, it already has bacteria in/on it.  As fruit matures, it emis gas. Sorry ,cant remember the name of it , but i think that its closely related to co2. This may explain why shops sell stands for bananas to keep themm free of the gas which ripens and ultimately rots them . When stororing apples ,they were traditionally individually wrapped, but kept well seperated. Perhaps our predecessors had worked out what to do without the scientific reasoningFruits naturally release ethylene which hastens the ripening process. Also, bacteria and mold get to it. You can't prevent fruit from rotting. Putting fruits in a bag traps the ethylene gas and ripens them more quickly. So in principle by not putting them in a bag you can slow the ripening process due to ethylene but you probably increase its exposure to bacteria and mold. Keeping them in the fridge might help limit bacteria and mold exposure. Keep ripe fruits away from unripe ones because of ethylene.|`|1e4385b333fdc39a5947962d4e029837aa	Fruits naturally release ethylene which hastens the ripening process.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Yes, it is.  The North Polar ice cap is melting more each summer.  The ice floes that the bears were used to are sometimes gone when the bears swim out and they may not be able to get back to shore.    "The chief threat to the polar bear is the loss of its sea ice habitat due to global warming. However, the polar bear is also stressed by other human activity, particularly oil and gas development activities in its habitat.    According to scientists, saving wildlife from the threat of global warming requires more than reducing global warming pollution. To help wildlife cope with the stress caused by climate change, natural resource managers must take action to reduce non-climatic stressors. In the case of the polar bear, this means that natural resource managers must limit oil and gas development in the polar bear's habitat. The Alaskan polar bear population relies heavily on the Arctic coastal plain for denning. It also relies on the ice on the Beaufort and Chukchi seas for both denning and hunting. Both of these habitat areas are threatened by increasing oil and gas development. Although the polar bear is now listed as a threatened species, the Secretary of Interior limited certain protections for the polar bear and will allow oil and gas development to continue in important polar bear habitat."|`|NnFWMyJiaa	another note, polar bear population is growing faster then human population|`|Q2rG2hCNaa	Arctic summer ice does melt and the 2007 area was at a 30 year record low, However, since then ice growth has increased and summer 08 area was 1M sq.km. greater than 07. Polar bears are a very hardy species and survived the Medieval Warm period and Roman warm period, both times warmer than today ( regardless of what the alarmists say). global temperatures are falling, and have done since 1998. The bears should have no problem unless the winters get more severe. At present the Arctic ice is so thick that the seals, the bears main food, have moved south and bears are finding it harder to find food. So perhaps a colder Arctic is not actually what the bears need. I might add that polar bears are incredible swimmers and distances of 100 miles are an easy prospect for them.

E0U2yII3aa	Astronomers theorize that a star needs to be above 40 solar masses to be able to leave a black hole remnant. Others say above 60 solar masses. Either way, a 40 solar masses star will spend less than 4 million years in main sequence while a 60 solar masses one will spend 2 million years to die in a powerful supernova/hypernova. But these values are ideal or very conservative. Cyg OB2  12 which is 92 solar masses has an estimated age over 6 million years. On the other hand, if you will look at SGR 1806-20, it should have been a black hole, why? Judging from the mass of LBV 1806-20, another cluster member, which is above 100 solar masses, SGR 1806-20 could have been born more massive to go first as a stellar remnant. However, it is now a magnetar - a young, madly spinning neutron star, not a black hole. The cluster is said to be less than 2 million years, by the way.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	The site linked below says that a 25 Msun star will go through the main sequence (H burn) in 7x10^6 years, or 7 million years.  However, there are a lot of factors that probably play into that, such as the metallicity of the star, the rotation speed of the star, etc.      As you can see from the above answer, the error bars on the mass required to become a black hole are quite large.  I've seen minimum masses estimated all the way down to 8 Msun, although 60 Msun sounds way high to me.  The most frequently estimated size appears to be between 10 and 20 Msun.  The answer really is that we don't have a firm grasp of the minimum mass of a star that is destined to become a black hole.

In the range 0 to 2, the second equation is greater than the first.    In the range 2 to 5, the first equation is greater than the second.    So integrate the two original equations and solve each in the range 0 to 2.  Subtract one answer from the other, and if necessary find the absolute value (area is always positive).  Then repeat in the range 2 to 5.  Then, add both areas and I think you have your answer.  I'll leave the integration, etc. to you.

Most importantly, you don't know the difference in the times that they leave or the distance to the destination. You also lack information about how much they stop--are they going a constant speed with no stops?     Assuming the simplest case, they are leaving to go somewhere else at the same time, and will go straight there at a constant speed, then of course the bus arrives first. Quirking it up and saying that their destination is their starting place, then they arrive simultaneously. If they don't go straight there, have stops, or leave at different times, then you'd actually have to calculate something. . . .

AA10929714	The method of undetermined coefficients is a technique for finding the particular solution to non-homogeneous, linear differential equations with constant coefficients (which is what you have here).  It only works when the nonhomogeneous function ((t - 3) in this case) involves terms of the form t^n, sin(a*t), cos(b*t), exp(c*t), a constant, and/or products of these functions.  It works because terms that fall into these categories only have a finite number of derivatives (ignoring constant factors).    The basic idea is to form the sets containing each term of the nonhomogeneous function plus all the derivatives of that term (ignoring constant factors).  Then, one looks for a particular solution that consists of a linear combination of all the members of those sets.  If one member of a set turns out to have a form that is already represented in the solution to the homogeneous version of the equation, then, because each solution to a differential equation must be linearly independent of all the others, you must multiply every member of that set by t^n, where n is chosen so that none of the resulting members of the new set appear in the homogeneous solution.  In this case, we will not have to do this.    For your problem, the nonhomogeneous function is t-3, which contains only terms involving t^n or a constant, so we can use this method.    The derivative of the first term, t, is 1, and the second derivative is zero, so this term gives rise to the set {t, 1}.  The second term, 3, is just a constant, and is already represented by the 1 in the first set, so it doesn't give rise to any more potential terms in the trial particular solution.    We end up looking for a particular solution of the form:    y_p(t) = a*t + b*1, where a and b are the "undetermined coefficients" that we must find.  We find them by differentiating the trial solution, and plugging it back into the original differential equation:    y'_p(t) = a     so    a + 2*(a*t + b) = t - 3    2*a*t  + (a + 2b) = t - 3    For this equation to be true, the coefficients of like powers of t on either side of equals sign the must be equal, which implies:    2a = 1  and  a + 2b = - 3    The first equation gives that a = 1/2, so b = -7/4    The particular solution is then:    y_p(t) = t/2 - 7/4    and the complete solution is given by the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:    y(t) = c*exp(-2*t) + t/2 - 7/4    Where c is a constant of integration that must be found from an initial condition.

In an entire population there can be a few, or tens, or hundreds of variants (alleles) of a gene, depending on the gene locus in question.    Here is an example of alleles listed for one locus in fruit flies.http://www.indiana.edu/~oso/lessons/Whit...    However very few traits are determined by just one gene alone. Most are polygenic needing the combination of at least two but more likely many loci (genes). For a polygenic trait the number of alleles is twice the number of loci that are required for the trait.  http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:I-_a...

In Canada and the United States, deer, bears, mountain lions, bobcats, rabbits, woodpeckers, and many smaller birds make the temperate forest their home. In China, endangered species such as giant pandas and red pandas survive in the temperate forest.    Wildlife in temperate forests is not always easy to see.

If the flat marbles are perfectly ellipsoidal and all the same, they will have the same porosity too, provided they are stacked up neatly.    Angular gravel or rocks can have higher porosity, but if compacted it will have lower porosity than the round marbles. again, if there is a spread in sizes the porosity will be less.|`|78b3d834e72deac7083fdd58233b5cbfaa	In general, the bigger the object the higher the porosity.

While anti-icing and pre-treatment have resulted in large reductions of salt use on Minnetonka roads, the city has taken additional steps to reduce salt use. Those steps include calibrating equipment, installing applicator controls that adjust according to the speed of the truck, and measuring pavement temperature to determine the correct amount of salt to apply and avoid salt waste.

AA12148992	How much do you know?    Easiest way to do it is to note that you can extend f to the closure of I, cl(I), which is closed and bounded, hence compact, so the image is closed and bounded.  But this implies f(I) is bounded.  You can extend f because it is uniformly continuous and maps into a complete metric space.    You could also show that uniformly continuous maps send totally bounded sets to totally bounded sets, and that totally bounded and bounded are equivalent in R.    Or you can just try and show it directly.    Steve
IUmAflSqaa	f is uniformly continuous if, for every e > 0, there exists d > 0 such that for all x, y in [a,b] such that |x-y|     So suppose f is not uniformly continuous.  Then there exists e > 0 such that, for all d > 0, there exist x, y in [a,b] such that |x-y|     Since [a,b] is compact, we know that x_n has a convergent subsequence.  (Or, using less advanced concepts, any sequence of reals contains a monotonic subsequence; since our sequence is in [a,b], it's bounded above and below, so the monotone sequence theorem says that the subsequence must converge.)  Let's replace x_n by this subsequence, and let's replace y_n by the the subsequence obtained by taking the same indices as the subsequence of x_n.  Say x_n converges to p.  Then it's easy to see that y_n also converges to p.  (Show this.)    Now if f were continuous, then since x_n and y_n converge to p, we would have f(x_n) and f(y_n) converge to f(p).  But f(x_n) and f(y_n) cannot converge to the same point, since |f(x_n)-f(y_n)|  e and so, if they both do converge to some values a and b, we must have |a-b|  e.  (Make this more explicit.)  So we cannot have that both f(x_n) and f(y_n) converge to f(p), and so f is not continuous.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	If f is a continuous function onto the Reals, then for it to be uniformly continuous over the interval it has to be continuous at every point within the interval.  Since the given interval [a,b] contains its own limit points (said another way, it's compact) then any continuous function on the interval must have a continuous (and compact) image on the Reals and so is uniformly continuous.

cp1G4aDaaa	All squares are rhombuses.    Some rhombuses are squares.    A rhombus is a parallelogram with 4 congruent sides.      A square is a rhombus with 4 congruent angles.|`|PdBmOPI2aa	A square is a rhombus, but a rhombus isn't necessarily a square.|`|AA10800608	Ok ... lets look at it this way.    A simple definition of a Rhombus is that it is made up of 4 equal sides.      A Square has 4 equal sides therefor a square is a rhombus so as many have said a Rhombus is a square.    A definition for a square is that it has 4 equal sides and only right angles (90 degrees).  Since the right angle is not a requirement for a rhombus a square is not necessarily a rhombus.    The only thing remaining is to make sure that there is a rhombus that does not have right angles.  You can do this in your head by imagining a square that is connected and pulling the top edge over and the side edges will follow.  A specific example is a rhombus with angles of (30, 150, 30, 150).    So a rhombus is not necessarily a square.  A square is *always* a rhombus.|`|1WG0iCQWaa	No, a rhombus is not a square.

A rhombus doesn't need to have right angles.    Yes, every square is a rhombus.  To be a square, all the side-lengths must be the same, and this is precisely how a rhombus may be defined.

I am a photographer and I've had people show me pictures that show ghosts, angels, or other "energies". They could all be explained by dust, lens flare, lens aberrations, even something  blocking the flash.    I don't care what you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone and you don't try to force it on me. I am a skeptic. I doubt, therefore I am.|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Some are seeking attention and some may be   trying to pull a rip-off... but yes, there are some  who are genuine. They don't want money and  they usually don't want to talk about it, so that's  why they seem to be so rare.    Jean|`|YIy9yu4qaa	I think Eri is right about a majority of people who make such claims. Most people don't really know a lot about the paranormal, and are confused by some natural things going on.   I wouldn't be here answering questions if I thought that all spiritual activity was caused by delusion or fake.   That's not to say it isn't, but it would be nice to find some evidence that could be held up to a scientific spyglass and prove the existance of something. I doubt that will happen here on YA!, but why not?   Its actually a very small percent of people who are faking, so I like to give people the benefit of the doubt usually (unless its obvious) that they had experienced something. Some may even experience something paranormal, but if it can be explained by natural means, such as sleep paralysis, its not going to stand up to scientific scrutiny.  I think the biggest problem with the paranormal is that believers are not willing to accept evidence that something isn't real, and Occams Razor prevents the non-believers from excepting any evidence that is more likely caused by something natural.   For example, its possible that there are demons that attack people at night. However, believers refuse to accept the medical condition known as sleep paralysis, and non-believers would miss it if real demons were attacking people because Occams Razor tells us that we would not be able to use this as evidence because it resembles sleep paralysis too closely.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I make no distinction between "spiritual" sensitivity and emotional sensitivity and I do not believe such sensitivity to be supernatural.  If a person says he/she feels something I have no reason to doubt his/her word.  However, if that person makes a connection between a personal emotional experience and an event that occured independent of it I begin to have my doubts.|`|DWyvQ09raa	hey i know where your comming from ( kinda )  i am a sensitive, and it is not a great thing. i have ulcers in my stomach to prove the stress that i have gone through since i was a wee thing. its real. but when your in the state of mind its like a vibe thing. imagine going into a room where everyone hates you. imagine that unwelcome feeling. now imagine that with being blind. thats the emotional part of it. the bits of images that are shown to me is 110% REAL. there is no way of showing you. i have proven my self many times and say what is there and who its targeting and how it moves through the house, and where it likes to stay in the house. now i know that this is like describing colors to a blind man, but just realize everyone is different and this is one of the differences.  i died when i was a few months old for 3 min. growing up they thought that i had an over reactive imagination, but were perplexed when i was describing things i have never seen or heard of. like a 5 year old watching barney seeing hearing dead ppl is a little polar opposite.|`|24H5tznkaa	I know it's possible. I don't believe that every single person who says they have had such experiences are telling the truth and I do think that some people just don't know that there is a scientific explanation for it so they think it's paranormal.    That being said, on the skeptic's end of things, they make it sound like it's a rare occurrence and I don't agree with that. I think anyone can be spiritually sensitive if they open themselves up to it and try to understand it without looking down their nose at it.     We are spiritual beings having a physical experience. Anyone who can grasp that concept opens themselves up to a whole new way of seeing things and the evidence presents itself to them.|`|e6a9f39e931a3e787271baf127d1f6c5aa	I am spiritual sensitive.  I am not always nor do I make a deal out of it.  Yes, I really experience paranormal things.  Not all the time.  At first I thought it was evil but I talked to my pastor and he said that there is a thin veil between the physical and the spiritual world and some of us get a glimps now and then.|`|d8B8k0thaa	It could be possible, but if it is happening I dont see why the "other world" would not have just as many natural laws that apply to theirs...like if I jump we will have gravity, yes we can defy our natural laws for a little but neither the less the law always wins...if they are sensitive I dont think its something that can be very reliable because regardless of how many experiences a person could have, no one knows anything its really a ton of experiences and researchers trying to put it together

Basically, the C and the N will form a bond.|`|h1M2Ruq3aa	why three?    ribosomes connect amino acids together with peptide bonds to produce polypeptides, but most are much much longer than 3 in length - they eventually form enzymes or proteins within a system
RxukJqL5aa	This type of differential equation is a first-order linear differential equation.  There is a general method to solve this type (and whether the solution can be written without integrals is dependent on how simple the coefficients are).    Rewrite it as:  y' - y = x    And multiply both sides by e^(-x):  e^(-x)y' - e^(-x)y = xe^(-x)    Note now that the left-hand side is just the derivative of (e^(-x) y) when evaluated using the product-rule, so we actually have  (e^(-x) y)' = xe^(-x)    Integrate both sides to get:  e^(-x) y = -xe^(-x) - e^(-x) + C    Divide both sides by e^(-x) to solve for y:  y = -x - 1 + Ce^x    ---------    The only unanswered question is how I chose the e^(-x) when I multiplied both sides by it.  For that answer, see the source (step (2) in its step-by-step procedure).    Additionally, now that you know it is called a "first-order linear differential equation" you can search for others sources if you don't like the one I have ^_^.    ---------    *sigh* I wasn't emphasizing the fact it's an ODE - I never even mentioned that term, which makes me wonder how well you read my post before you made your bold statements.  I was emphasizing that it is "first-order linear", which is a general class of ODEs that we solve in the way shown in the source.    I'm sorry to say, but you are incorrect in how to integrate xe^(-x).  We cannot simply integrate x and e^(-x) and then multiply the integrals together - instead, we need to integrate "by-parts".  If you don't remember this topic, look back at your Calculus 1/2 textbook, as it is important.    If nothing else, you should check the solutions by hand.  y = -x - 1 + Ce^x  y' = -1 + Ce^x  and   x+y = x + (-x - 1 + Ce^x) = -1 + Ce^x.  which shows that this solution satisfies y' = x+y.    If we try your proposed solution...  y = -x^2 / 2 + Ce^x  y' = -x + Ce^x  Use these equations to substitute into the ODE and you'll find it doesn't work.
cp1G4aDaaa	You can't solve one equation in two variables !    You can graph the linear equation:  4x + 5y = 20    What is the slope ?    What is the y-intercept ?    What is the x-intercept ?    Do you have graph paper ?|`|61o2pu41aa	Go with Ahbar.  Except he wrote the one point wrong.

You can do this by subtracting the 4x over to the right side, than dividing the entire right side by the 5, than rearrange the equation to look like what I have above.  On the graph, if you start at (0,0), go up 4 units on the y-axis and plot your point. Than your rise/run would be the -4/5. So move down four units from your plotted point and over to the right five units and plot your second point.  Than connect the dots and you will have your line.  Hope this helps.

JxpT4PlZaa	Have you looked at the factoring programs on TiCalc.org?  For example, you can download Factrat 1.0, and see how Rick Skrbina approached it.    [Quote]  Title  Factrat 1.0 trinomial facotring tool    Description  This program helps you factor trinomials by giving you 2 numbers that are multiplied to give you A*C and added to give you B. This program also helps you determine weather the trinomial is factorable by giving you the discriminant. Note: this program does not solve quadratic equations, it helps factor them.    [/Quote]
