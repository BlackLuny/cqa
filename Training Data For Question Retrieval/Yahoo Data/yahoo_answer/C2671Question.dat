20090203114241AAC7nlB	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone had this experience with a spay?	Picked my dog up this am. I noticed that my 7 month old puppy would take 3-4 steps, stop and immediatly sit.  She is also whinning periodically.... AND she has already had 2 accidents in the house.      I called them and they have me giving her pain meds and said to watch her closly and to bring her in in the morning if I am still concerned.  They said the accidents should not be anything to worry about YET!  I have owned or known many dogs that have been spayed w/o any of this stuff so is this actually common and I am worryign too much or am I possibly in for it with the accidents.      Thanks

20090203120022AAIWhtH	Pets;Dogs	Is it possible for dogs to get "stuck" to each other during mating? ?	I know this is an odd question, but I really need to know. Two large breed dogs in the neighborhood who appear to be stuck together - butt to butt, but w/ the males junk obviously in the female. I'm guessing when he tries to dismount & canj't, he ends up twisating in that position. My neighbor said it can hurt them if you throw water or somethign to try & get them apart to help them.       I wouldn't want to hurt them, but this is just weird to me & the female seems in pain. Is this possible or is it another problem? Is there a way to help them (water maybe)?  Or just let them be & hope nature helps them figure it out? lol       (Don't know whose dogs they are, but they look healthy & I wouldn't want to call animal control on someone's beloved pets unless absolutely necessary. Maybe they're escaping their yard.)

Both of the dogs have soft poop and it looks yellow and they have horrible gas. I am wanting to get something that I can buy online and is no more than $50 for 30lbs.      I feed my cat friskies and want to get them on something that is more healthy. So I am open for recomendations.

I recently adopted this male blue pitbull (now probably 6-7 months) since December.         Everything is fine, but time to time, the male pit would show aggression towards the female pit.  Once I was out of town and my mother had fed them, but she didn't know they had to be separated and they both were fighting aggressively, and both suffered minor cuts and bruises.  My brother came out asap and he stopped both of them by spraying water on them with the hoes.      They're fine alone, but time to time they would start growling at each other.  They live and sleep in the same dog house with no problem.      Now, how do I stop the aggression the new dog is giving my older one?  Also, how do I know who's the alpha dog in the pack when I'm not around?

Since I brought her home, she has been snorting and sneezing snot all over the place.  When she sleeps, she snores exceptionally loud.  She is a very affectionate cat and will be sitting on your lap, then go into a gross sneezing fit.  She is up-to-date on her shots, and just went to the vet 2 weeks ago.  The vet said she just had a cold, and gave me antibiotics for her.  I followed the directions the vet gave me, and didn't miss any doses on her medicine.  Does anybody know what her problem may be?  I don't want to keep taking her back to the vet, especially because it doesn't seem to be helping.  It's really annoying to have cat boogers and snot sneezed all over you, and just plain sick.  What can I do?

When I go to lay down, he will either lay behind my pillow or at my feet. This is not unusual as I have had him through out the pregnancy. I'm now 38 and a half weeks and he has been meowing very territorially at my when behind my pillow, he will literally walk up to the back of my head and give out this horrid meow. Then sometimes he will cuddle up next to me and if I pet him (try to anyways) he will give me the same meow and sometimes even give me a light bite, usually not enough to hurt. He won't leave my side much, he is usually within 5-10 feet of me and has made it clear that he prefers me over my partner. Why is he acting like this? Is there anything I can do to get him to stop doing that horrible meow? I'm afraid to even hold him as I know when he is about to give me gut wrenching meow because his eyes are fully dilated.

The bigger dog has never acted with another dog this way and thought maybe she knows its a puppy and is trying to claim her dominance, is this something I should be concerned about or is this normal behavior!!!

She's only about 12-14 weeks old, and we are hoping she's only here for a month or less but she is feral.   Hissing, scratching, running away. We've got her in a cage now and she can't escape out of it but I'm not entirely sure how to socialize her, the rescue didn't go into details.   Anyone got some advice?   Thanks!

20090221053650AAxAXYB	Pets;Rodents	Little rat eating poop :(?	I have 2 female rats one is 6 months old and the other is almost 4 months old.  Lately I have noticed my older rat eating poop.  Both rats only poop in one corner of the cage, so they know it's something that they don't want everywhere but still, I catch her eating it.  They have a very healthy diet of lab blocks, seed mix, nuts, fruits, veggies, and lots of treats and their food bowl never goes empty.  Why is she eating poop and will it harm her?  How can I get her to stop?      The younger one doesn't eat the poop, just the older one.

20090220191546AApTU4X	Pets;Cats	Could something be bothering my cats teeth?	I've always thought my cat was just a bit of a biter, as he is a male cat and can get a little aggressive. Lately he's been sneaking more bites of my hand than usual, and since he catches me off guard, I notice he isn't biting out of "RAWR THIS IS MY PREY" but its more like a "I just want to chew on something."      It isn't just my hand, he's been gnawing on whatever he can find, while my other cats aren't as prone to this behavior. Could something be bothering his teeth, that he feels he needs to chew on something? He's about 2 years old now, and a bit overweight if that helps.

I got the beta kit from Petco so it has everything I need to care for it. If it makes him happier I might just change his tank.

20090221025037AA3FFxa	Pets;Dogs	One puppy or two puppies?	What I meant by my last post was not that we were going to let the puppies bond together more than with us, or that we will let them pick up bad manners from each other. You see, if we feel we need to, we might keep the two puppies crates in seperate romms. Also, the only time the puppies will definately be together is on walks. They might be together during play time, however, we will also be involved in their play, so the puppies won't really get much bonding time until they are both pretty well trained ( basic obedience ). Obedience classes will be together, however, there will be me and my brother there, not just one of us. I will focus on one puppy, and my brother on the other. If we feel one puppy is giving bad habits to the other one, we will not train them together. At home training, they will be trained seperately. While one puppy plays with my siblings, I will be going over what we learned at obedience classes with the other. And then, we switch. So again, other than walks, and potty time, the puppies won't really get to bond a lot, atleast not until they know some basic manners. I understand you people saying that raising e

Be very careful to read the labels. I found a triple antibiotic ointment plus. This has a localized painkiller in it. Do not use this Pramoxine  HCL on the eye lid it will cause a painful reaction  to the eye tissue. It burns . I know because when I put it on my kitten G.W. his eye became blood red. So I then tried it on my eye and the burning was horrible. I washed his eye with and my eye with milk that stopped the pain but our  eyes are healing slowly. So read the label and only use it on wounds that have no mucus membranes involved.
20090220190130AALHUr5	Pets;Cats	Do cats pick their owners?	I feed a feral cat colony at my apartment building every day! For 5 years now...not once a cat has picked me. Last year I saw this kitty about 2-3 weeks old while I was walking my 2dogs, he was blind & in bad shape. Took him to an emergency vet & got pills for him, eye drops etc, fed him with a bottle for 3 weeks , he got his eyesight back and my dogs took care of him, so he loves the dogs, but he does not want me to touch him? He is a year old now .      2- When I feed the feral cat colony, few days ago this little kittie started following me and the dogs right next to us and meowing. So I said hello and let him us followed us a few times.       3- I know that they are different so I waited and one day took my little carrier & my dogs of course & went to get him it was 12 degrees and was snowing. He came running to me and I picked him up and he purred so loud, brought him home!    4- Why does this new kitty loves me so much & the other one does not! The one I saved the life.   Do cats pick their owners?   The new kitty adores me. I have them in separate rooms because they hate each other
20090220200507AADNNHy	Pets;Dogs	I have a few questions about dog rules in chicago and suggestions.....?	I have a 2 year old golden retriever who is an outdoor dog. He's always outside and in an electric fenced backyard, so he is used to going to the bathroom outside. I live in a quiet suburb of Milwaukee Wisconsin. Now I am going to chicago this weekend to visit relatives. They live in downtown chicago in an apartment and dogs are allowed there. If we spend the whole time in the apartment, my dog would need to go to the bathroom. Is it legal for my dog to go to the bathroom outside in the crowded streets of downtown chicago if i pick up the poop? If that does not work, would it be ok to leave him back home alone for about 14 hours? (the dog kennel is full and we have no other place to keep our dog) Thanks!

Lemme say it like this, the dog is spoiled rotten. First, her eating habits.      Whatever anybody eats, she must eat. Even if she just ate. I don't do that cause, well, (A growing teen gotta eat :p) but that don't stop anybody else. She eats anything you can possibly thing of, from every meal off the food pyramid to junk food (even Ice-cream sandwiches).      She sleeps in the bed with my mom and not even on the foot. Like, in the middle between her and my stepfather.      She chews up a lot of things in sight (sneakers mostly).      I don't know anymore, does she think she's pack leader? How can we stop her and make her act like how a submissive dog should act like? Hell, are we even in control anymore?

It slowly "retracted" in a duration of ~2 hours, then it happened again after awhile.   When the lining over his eye is present, he seems irritated by it and blinks his left eye a lot.   I've seen this lining before though, when I open his eyelids while he's sleeping; but this is the first time I've seen it exposed while he's awake.      I've already tried searching an answer to this. But it's hard since I don't know what this is at all. I found a page that seemed to have what I was looking for, but I was asked to register/pay to see the answer... >.>      So if anyone can tell me anything you know about this; even if it's just what that lining is called so I can google it more specifically.      Please and thank you. :]
20090220192033AAacxhN	Pets;Cats	Cats' sense of direction? Help!?	Well my (favorite, and uberfavorite) cat just got out of the house on accident a little while ago...A little over one and a half hours. It's very cold out. Very. We have no idea where he is, so we can only wait for him to come home. We've combed the neighborhood and called him and whatnot, but you can't do much at night.      He's gotten out once before and we found him on the doorstep, but it wasn't cold out.      I'm asking a few things here:      First, do cats have good enough sense of direction to find their way home even through unexplored territory?      Second, Would a cat be able to survive overnight in a subdivision with cars commonly passing, thirty degree cold, and lots of other cats?      And lastly, would you wish me luck that I find him? :3      Thanks for any help! I'm so sad I lost mah kitteh...

20090220193255AAakBsm	Pets;Cats	How to have a pets if you want to keep the house sanitary.?	This may be the most neurotic question but here goes.  We don't wear shoes inside our house.  I just think it's gross to wear shoes inside the house that have stepped on "goodness knows what!" outside the house.  I have young children and I'd like to get a pet for them (a dog) but I just can't seem to muster pass the idea that a dog can't wear shoes and will be trekking disgusting things inside our house, on the couch, on the bed...etc.  It's not even a question of keeping the house clean.  It's really a question of keeping things sanitary.  I know it's not possible to keep a pet strictly outside the house.  Does anyone have a solution to this? How can I have a dog if I want to keep the house sanitary?
20090220200801AAJlhBe	Pets;Cats	Stray cat or just a neighbour's cat?	My family has been putting cat food out for a cat with no collar that has been visiting our yard.  At first it was shy, but now it is very, very affectionate, purring and rubbing its head against us.  She is always trying to get in the house now, even clawing at the window and meowing.  It's hard to ignore.  My father is badly allergic so we can't let it in, but it is VERY persistent and I feel bad leaving it outside in subzero temperatures.     It is well groomed and a healthy weight - could this just be a neighbour's cat?  How do I tell if it's really a stray?  It seems to be outside too often to be owned by someone, but it seems to healthy to be a stray!

20090221015359AAqXfpa	Pets;Dogs	Puppy training tips? ...?	There's a long story behind it, but I recently adopted a puppy, about 6 and a 1/2 months old mixed breed neutered male. As stated in my question, I could REALLY use some good tips on how to train him. Basically, I'd just like him to become a good obedient pet (don't we all). I especially want to make sure that he's well trained and behaves himself properly during our walks, because I have a few packs of stray dogs in my neighbourhood and the possibility of them coming along, ganging up on and hurting him makes me feel really worried. I understand the importance of socialization (hope it's not too late?) and know I should probably start there...but don't really know how. I could take him to the park nearby but don't know what's the best way to introduce him to the other dogs? If I don't count them as a potential threat, our neighbourhood is pretty large and quiet (with almost no cars at all) and I think that it would be really great for him if I could teach him how to behave off leash so that he could run freely when we're walking... So far he's learned to look at me when I call his name, "sit" and "come" (not reliable yet, but I think we're getting there). He's playful and hyperactive but stops with whatever it is that he's doing when I say "no" once or twice - I guess that's good for a start... I'll be thankful for any advice/opinion.

20090221032953AAqH2At	Pets;Rodents	Question about rabbits and guinea pig hutches???	Hiya, i'm finding out more about keeping guinea pigs and rabbits, and answers from experienced rabbit/guinea pig owners would be helpful...   I live in England, so it's not always that warm (but it's not constantly snowy and cold!) would it be ideal to keep any rabbits and piggies outside, or is it better inside? Do they not mind it if it's cold now and then?   Also, i was thinking about getting two rabbits and a guinea pig, is this a good mix, or am i better off getting one piggie and one rabbit, or just two rabbits on their own??   About the hutch, if it's possible to get 2 rabbits and one guinea pig, then what sort of hutch would be best. I'm thinking about keeping them outside, if it's possible, i just don't know what sort of house/hutch would be best - any pictures, websites would be a great help - and if you own a similar number of rabbits, what hutch do you have, and do you think it's a good one for that number???   Thank you for all answers!!! :)

20090221040720AAHkQLk	Pets;Horses	Which season is your favourite to ride in?	Summer - Galloping along a bright green grass field with nothing infront or aroung you. The songs of the birds and the feel of the warm wind through your hair. The heat on your back of your neck and the sun reflecting off your ponies velvet coat giving him a lovelhy warm, soft feel.      Autum - Walking through woods with the noise of leeves crunching under your ponies feet. The sun streaking through the golden trees standing over your path of alburn.      Winter - Pacing through a white field with nothing surrounding you just white. Steam coming out of your ponies nostrils and he keeps himself warm as you trudge through a magical blanket of winter.       Spring - Trotting up an old farm track. Your pony turning its head slowly around looking at the new lambs in the field and the birds soaring through the fresh air of spring. Breathing in the freshness of the sky.

But, Im really picky. =/   So I really want a small snake that will STAY small. Somewhere around 2-3 feet when it grows. I don't really want it to be chubby, more on the skinny side. One that doesn't eat mice ! My mom barely let me even get a snake, if she sees me feeding it mice too, she'll die. (By the way, im a beginner)      So I was looking for one that would fit, and I couldn't find anything.   I found the smooth/rough green snake, but people said that they aren't too good in captivity and will die in the first year and they don't like to be handled. So im pretty desperate, I don't even think there is a breed that will suit what I would prefer. Haha.      But if you have anything even close to my despcription, I would REALLY appreciate it if you would answer my question.      Thank you so much for taking your time !!

However, my dog has managed to climb on a work surface and reach the top shelf where the paracetamol is kept. I think he's eaten two tablets and i'm not sure if the effects will be serious or what happens?

20090221035042AAS7H2A	Pets;Dogs	Need help on what to get a new puppy?	I will be getting a new puppy on Wednesday and  need some help. I have a list of everything to get her, or him still haven't decided, but I keep feeling I am forgetting something so a list to compare to would be nice and any insight helpful. I have never had a puppy really just one and she was kinda unexpected as I found her and took her home off the streets so didn't really plan anything or get anything just food and basic stuff to get her warm and healthy and a ton of toys lol, because I didn't think I was going to keep her. This puppy is a purebred cocker spaniel so I know there will be a lot of grooming and such but would just like some suggestions for what to get for the puppy to keep her healthy and safe, also if any of you own a cocker spaniel please let me know what to use on their ears I know they are prone to ear infections from their ears being long and floppy and would like some advice on what the best product or method you use. Also any suggestions on puppy proofing the home would be great, right now I am cleaning and putting everything up I already have a puppy gate and am going to get bitter apple as that worked the best with a dog I adopted from the shelter who literally ate everything, but what do I do about cords and outlets, whats the best way to tape them off especially with a circuit breaker. Thank you for taking the time to read and all your help.

20090221044508AATxbJw	Pets;Cats	My 13 year old cat has a heart murmur?	He's gone through a lot in his life.  Nearly died from liver failure, then blood parasites a few months later.  He currently has diabetes...      I've been treating him for that, and it seems like he's about to go into remission.  However, at his last vet appointment she noted a heart murmur.  She specifically mentioned she could not hear it before, probably a month ago.  She says she uses a scale of 1-5, instead of 1-6...  For whatever reason...  He is a 2 on the scale.      As I understand, the only way to properly diagnose is to visit a cardiologist, but it's just too expensive for us to do so.  So now after all he's gotten through, this could be the nail in the coffin.      I'm curious if anyone knows if this grade 2(out of 5) murmur could end up being harmless?  I have read elsewhere that many older cats have murmurs, but the sudden onset seems more like a sign of cardiomyopathy, does it not?      If it were up to me I would spend the money, get an ultrasound and start treating...  But unfortunately it is not.  He's a good cat, I don't want him to suffer a lot.  If he has cardiomyopathy will his death be slow and painful?        It's really extremely depressing.

20090221051257AAWOPIU	Pets;Dogs	I have a 5yr old mixed terrier who's personality haschanged overnite and I cant understand what happened.?	She is a house dog that enjoys going outside and chasing small creatures.  She is part of a bread that herds cattle so she has the instinct to chase.  Two nites ago she would not come in for the night .  Its was raining and cold and the next morning she finally came in.  Here is where she changed.  Now for some reason she acts like she is scared all the time.  She shakes and at times will not leave my side, but at other times she acts like she is afraid to be in the house.  She will sleep at the bottom of my bed at night, but in the middle of the night she will come to the pillow i am on and shake so hard and will not move.  I am really worried and I need some advise.  I love her like a child and wonder if this change is permanent.

20090219173652AAZhCmn	Pets;Dogs	What is your dog's name (or family member's or friend's dog) and how did they get it?	I love hearing how dogs got their name!       I don't own a dog yet (will be getting one over the summer!) but my cousin's dog is named Tammy. She got that name because my cousin's friend got the dog for her as a present (he made sure she could have a dog first) and his last name is Talmage so she came up with Tammy because of his last name. I guess it was like a dedication. But it fits her personality perfectly!      So how did your dog get their name? Or a family member's dog or a friend's?

20090219173114AAcdKGg	Pets;Dogs	Why would a house-trained dog suddenly start pooping in the house?	Ok, so here's the situation. I have 3 dogs, a 2yr old pit named Blaze, a 11 month old pit/mastiff mix named Chuckie, and a 6 yr old min. daschund named Zeenuh. About a week ago we noticed someone was pooping in the house, particularly in what will be my son's bedroom when he is born. currently the dog's kennels are in there. I thought maybe it was from the rawhide i gave them in Vday, but it has continued through today!!! At first i thought it was Blaze, because he has a history of being problematic when it came to potty training, and Chuckie since day one was on the ball with it. So last night I had enough and I made Blaze sleep in his kennel. Well, low and behold there was 5 piles of poop in that same room this morning, so it MUST have been from Chuckie. (way too big for it to be from Zeenuh). And the thing I don't get is, its not diarrhea type poop- its solid, normal poop. All dogs go out 4-5 times a day, and Chuckie poops everytime he goes out. He has never ever done this, not even when he was a lil bitty pup. No changes in diet either. I simply cannot understand why he would be doing this and I am quite fed up with this behavior!!!       Any suggestions on why, and how to stop it?

Then after another 6 days another big fish the died. There's 1 more big fish 3 small fish and 2 snails left. There's green algae and this "odd" brown algae is on the walls.  The 2 fish that died were not on the top but the bottom with a bloody side.  I think the small fish (neon tetra's) are eating the big fish (glass fish).  Do you know if that's the cause, or if the brown algae is the cause, or what is.  I'm really upset about it.  Oh and some additional details are the big fish were hiding in the little houses before they died, I got them at a just fish, and the ones that died were a purple, and a green glass fish.   If you need to know anything else just put it in your answer and I'll add it.

I bought a betta about a week ago and have noticed today that his tail fin seems to have a black edge that I don't think it had before. He is acting absolutely fine though, really healthy fellow, and if anything he looks better now than he did in the pet shop as his colours are really coming out.       I have done a 50% water change as a precaution and am using aquarium salt but would just like to know if there's any chance of this being fin rot or if it's simply his tail growing? He is only a young fish, roughly 3/4 months old so I'm hoping that it is just his tail growing as he gets older.      I really hope he's going to be ok!      Also, he is a DR crown-tail, but actually looks like he could develop into a CR. Can anyone let me know what traits I should be looking out for? His DR extensions seem to point away from each other, as if they could cross over if they were a bit longer....      Thank you in advance!

20090219172734AAPJKlx	Pets;Dogs	My dog is afraid of almost everything!?	I've had my dog for about 9 months. He is comfortable in my house and all but when we get to close to him when we're walking or when we go to pick him up he acts all scared like if we're going to hit him. We've never abused any of our animals or hurt him in anyway. I don't know what's wrong with him. And today he had a piece of rope stuck between his teeth from a dog toy and me and my parents had to get around the couch and catch him cuz he was gagging on it. and now he won't come near any of us. Is there anyway to help him get over the shyness and stuff? Also when people come and leave he freaks out and tries to bite their feet. He's a Chihuahua so he doesn't really hurt people but i don't know what to do!

20090203092840AADhY1P	Pets;Cats	Cat food question.. HELP!! easy 10 points!?	i have a three year old long haired male cat and a few months ago he started peeing blood but not in his kitty litter, on the floor and carpet. we took him to the vet and they gave us medicine to give him and told us to put water in his hard food to soften it a bit. we gave him the full dose and watered his food but a few weeks later it started again, so i bought him canned, wet food. he hasn't peed anywhere but the litter box and nothing but pee ever since but the food is so expensive!!! can anyone recommend a more sensitive dry food that won't be hard for him to digest or an inexpensive wet food? PLEASE!!! it cost so much money to keep buying wet food, if there is no other option i will continue to do this but I really wanna find a better way if there is one. THANKS!!

20090219173105AAM0T9r	Pets;Cats	Help my baby kitten please!!!!?	She is 4 months old, and when we got her she was fine. Nice stool and everything. Since a week ago shes been having diarreah and today its even worse (very slimy/light brown)       We have been feeding her kitten chow and I assume thats not the reason. We got her pounce treats however, but the real chicken flavor, not the ones that were recalled. Today she has also been VERY tired. We also adopted another grown cat that was very scared of living here, so we brought her back (that cat ate out of the same bowl as our kitten did, however I always wash the bowl whenever I feed our kitten)      The strange thing is, she is still her playful self when shes awake.      Does anyone know what the problem is?

20090219174439AA4nYCe	Pets;Dogs	What caused my dog's death?	My dog was diagnosed with Addison's disease (2003) but it is complicated   with another diagnosis of Lymphoma Sarcoma (lymph node cancer, 2004) which   he took chemo for and has been in remission over a year.  He went for a vet   check (yearly) last week on a Tuesday, got shots and blood was drawn.   Everything came back fine including the blood work.  He was a perfectly   healthy  7 year old dog except for his conditions that were kept in check.   By Friday of the same week, he could hardly breathe.  I had to have him   euthanized on Wednesday (yesterday) due to another heart wrenching diagnosis   of Cardiac Fibrillation.  My question is....is it possible that all the   injections he received (distemper, rabies and his steroid injection) gave   him the heart condition?  He has been taking steroid injections for 5 years,   every three weeks. He wasn't due for the rabies until August of this year.   I am so heart broken over his death.  He was my companion and best friend.   I loved him dearly and would have done whatever I could to save him if it   was possible.  Please help me with some    answers.  Thank You!      Serious responses only please!

20090203094642AAaphiP	Pets;Cats	Fleas, ear mites, or something else?	two 15 year olds, mixed breeds. one long hair, one short. indoor/outdoor.   spayed .      about a month ago, both started scratching at their ears and shaking their heads, assumed ear mites, brought long hair to vet. vet said it was fleas, not ear mites.      i had been using FRONTLINE during the summer, and it worked very well, but stopped because the long hair hates it. she apparently hates the feeling on her neck and the fact she cant reach it, so she runs away. it really stresses her. so i tried PROGRAM FLAVOR TABS, and CAPSTAR. they have had no effect. suggesting it is not fleas.      the long hair has gotten worse, she now has a scab on her neck, presumably from scratching, covered in flea dirt. it hurts her when i touch it. this suggests fleas, and i should go back to FRONTLINE.      BUT, both cats only scratch the ears, suggesting it is not fleas, as with fleas they scratch, chew and lick, every where.      i realize the vet could be wrong, i could return and show him the scab.      but i was wondering if any one has seen this before, is there something, that flea meds wont work on, that infests mainly the ears and causes the flea dirt? can ear mites travel out of the ear and cause the scab with the dirt?      also, does any of the FRONTLINE type, liquid on the neck flea meds use less liquid or somehow would be less annoying to a cat?      thank you

He is used to being around another dog, and cats in his previous home, when the family wasn't there. We have no other pets. He has only lived with us for a couple days, and has not been left alone for more than a couple minutes at a time. We live in an apartment building, and I don't want him barking for hours on end, if we both have to work at the same time. We are already re-arranging our schedules, so someone is aways here, but obviously, that won't always be able to happen.    I don't want the neighbors complaining...so if anyone has any tips or tricks, that would be greatly appreciated!!!
20090203095638AAtMFxe	Pets;Dogs	I need help about my dog!?	ok. i got a 2 yr old puppy from a girl who had six dogs. She let me know that he had been saved from the spca. and that he's been in there twice. and that he was neglected and i believe maybe abused verbally. Well since i've gotten him he's gotten better on being more playful and not shy but since day one he has accidents like he's scared or when he's excited. I could be just putting the leash on him and he just pees. Or walking opening my door into my room and he just pees right after we've been outside.Idk what else to do he is a loving dog but this problem has been going on since oct. I have no idea what to do.
