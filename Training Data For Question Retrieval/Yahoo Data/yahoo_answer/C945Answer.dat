jLI0IgWkaa	firstly you should report the lost driving license to the police, they will give you a form confirming the report of the lost license. then bring that form to your local DMV office, and ask for a replacement license. )you may have to pay for it)    good luck .|`|AA10620879	If you just lost it you can go to MVD and get a duplicate for a fee, if it was taken away by courts than that is another matter entirely which means it is suspended and have to thumb a ride or hail a bus/taxi.|`|1QRLr6Caaa	Go to concerned RTO office and give them a request form..I hope your problem will get sorted out then and there.|`|snh9wzpnaa	You can get a duplicate copy of your lost license.

xFRqtKr0aa	For the stuff: giving it to the cops to return to him should end that bit. Just explain to them that you were given and used the items while employed and and that you were not informed that you had to return the items. Since you obviously did not sign a contract listing the item and cost, he could not deduct them from your final pay and is obviously why he filed the police report.    For the conference: Since you feel the employer may take things personally, get written statements, with contact information for verification, from your friends. Be sure to have them state that they choose not to have their identities revealed to the employer to avoid conflicts.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Call your dad and ask if you can spend weekends with him. He can feed you from Friday night to Sunday night saving your mom some money. Don't tell him you know he didn't pay child support your mom had no business telling you that. If you have a need like new shoes tell your dad when you are with him. Don't tell him your mom can't afford any because you shouldn't tell either anything about the other you are impartial and not a carrier pigeon.   Keep trying to find a job, ask your dad if he know some place you can work when you stay with him. Try to land a food service job like at Subway or McDonalds and you might get free food.     Your mom might qualify for food stamps if she is low income but you are the kid still so it isn't your problem one of them can look for part time work too.|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	So into all this woe and misery that you feel "terrible" about, you bring home a deadbeat boyfriend.

(2) You and the deadbeat boyfriend move in with HIS mom or dad and your poor mother will not starve to death.    Two great answers.

Putting trix cereal on the bottom shelf so the kids run by and scream at their parents "BUY THIS BUY THIS" is on purpose.     Products sell better where they are in higher demand. Thats why we do marketing surveys. To find out who consumes what , so we can better place products and there for sell sell sell sell :)|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It's like any advertisement.

That way millions of people will see it without realizing they're basically watching a commercial.|`|9e1a0e459c90e3a8eb8741a8fb042e12aa	Product placement is putting the product where it will receive maximum exposure to potential buyer. Like the candy at the cash register. You don't need it but it is there to entice you into an impulse buy. It was put there by the company to get you to buy it. and in many cases it works. they also know that children will see it and bug the parent for it.

But if she lives with her mom, it's very unlikely that she is head of household, so she probably has to file as married filing separately.  Your filing status is MFS in any case.    The supposed CPA who says you can file as single is way off on this one.....|`|AA11284831	You cannot file as Single if you are married.  You can file Married Filing Separately though.

Your divorce must have been finalized before the end of the year to file as single.  How and where you lived does not count for anything in this matter.

6469fd47e4c8756d176d1c44463e5f37aa	Typically homes are financed with no recourse loans, thats were the property is the only security the bank has for the loan and it can only take the home if the owner defaults on the mortgage.    The issue they need to worry about is, since it's a home, they probably lied on the loan docs saying that it was going to be owner occupied for the best interest rate and lowest down, which it is not as you just said they have it rented out.     For now they will just lose the home but it is possible as things shake out in the economy, banks may go after people they think have committed minor fraud crimes like misrepresentation on loans docs to recuperate losses.     The statute of limitations is at least a few years so even after the bank has taken the home, they could find them selfs having to explain why a supposedly owner occupied home that was foreclosed on had tenants in it.|`|tMz42vI2aa	the bank can not go after the home they reside in unless they took out a loan on that home in order to purchase the rental property. The collateral for the mortgage was the home.|`|z9Cd4EXbaa	Not unless they used their house as collateral for the the down payment. If its not in the contract they cant touch it.

Reasons: 1. It will assure your little secret remains your little secret. 2. It will assure tax returns are done in a professional manner, including taking advantage of any tax reduction oportunities. It will allow you and your friend to remain friends (taxes & money are always a controversial subject in a friendship). What guaranty do you have, that someday your dad will not hear via any "oooops", what your financial status really is? Also, if you live with relatives, make sure your tax return check is not opened "by mistake". Keep it a secret of one: yourself!|`|AA10925759	If you go out and get a professional on your own that will cost you. This guy who is charging is doing something very simple. I suppose HR Block would be best for you if you don't want to do it yourself. They have certain guarantees as well.... you wont get that with some guy who does returns on his own.     But at 20 you are probably not making $150,000 a year, own a home and all of that. You probably don't have any deductions. So it won't be complicated at all. Though if you happen to be paying tuition you might get a break there.    I make a lot have a house and all of that and I use Turbo Tax. It is easy, simple and they will deposit the money in your account. The basic edition is something like $15.00. It will tell you what to do.    One year out of curiosity I hired a CPA just to see. Then I did it on Turbo Tax. Turned out Turbo Tax got me more.
7oUnVcVfaa	It depends. The last time I used a check by phone the amount I paid was tied to the check I used. I told them check number 2764, gave the routing number, account number and the total for the check. On the physical check I entered all of the information and then wrote "Void" on it with "Paid over Phone". This way I could track the information.   If you did something similar then no don't use the check since it's probably tagged by the company and your bank as having been used and could cause a duplicate or error transaction.  Most banks have a pay bills online feature or you could use PayPal to pay the bill without having to submit your critical information.     I hope this helps.

There are higher unemployment rates right now than there have been in a very long time and many families can barely keep food on the table even though they are willing to work their asses off if they get the opportunity. My family happens to be one. So please, leave the jobs for people who really need them. Or take a babysitting or shoveling job, and just be grateful that you have one at all.    At your age service jobs are the way to go. If you can't get hired anywhere, raising mice as snake food, or dog sitting are creative ways to make some spending money.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	You will never, ever find an easy well-paying job. And 13-14 years old kids are not being hired by anyone except family members or family friends. Employers these days no longer want the hassle of hiring people under 18 (too much paperwork, and you won't be allowed to work enough hours for it to be worth it), so your best bet is to start baby/pet-sitting and building up regular families. You'll make decent money (I did), and you won't have to pay taxes on it. :)

N8HgRKnfaa	Paypal is for buying AND selling. So when you sign up, your new account makes both possible. You can put money in paypal directly from a bank account, but this is not advisable if you leave it there because it will not draw any interest.    The other way to get money in paypal is to sell something, which you are planning to do. This money will be available for buying or you can transfer it to your bank account.    When you buy something with paypal, paypal will first draw any funds you have from your paypal account. if there is not enough there, it will withdraw from your bank account. If you don't have money enough in the bank, your credit card will be charged if that is the way you set up your account. It's wise to have a backup money source if you think you might not have enough money in your bank, because if the bank doesn't have the funds it will charge you for an insufficient funds transaction.    Paypal is very safe. Keep in mind you will pay paypal a percentage of all sales, but when you buy something with paypal there is no charge.|`|XQwaYEGraa	Your paypal account is now linked to your bank account. The way it gets fund is two-sided, it can both withdraw and add funds to your bank account. You always authorize this.    For ebay you can use your paypal account to get the money after you sell something through an auction. You will also use your paypal account to pay any fees you have for selling. Lastly, most sellers only accept paypal as a form of payment.    You can also link your credit card and then decide if either your bank account or your credit card will be your primary source.|`|CkkEscwWaa	if u pick bank account and ur details r registerated. u can buy and sell u dont have to transfer funds if u want to buy but u can if u want payment through quicker. when u sell money will go straight into bank account|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	It simply means that "Whenever you buy something in the future, how do you want to pay for your purchase".    It used to say "How do you want to fund your account" and I guess that also confused people?        Go figure.
AA10274297	It sounds like you got an advance (loan) on your anticipated refund.  If the bank never got paid back for that loan, then you owe the bank the amount of the loan.  If they haven't collected the debt since 2001, it is probably too late for them to collect it from you now (the statute of limitations in most states is 7 years or less).    They don't have any way to get your refund this year (unless you use them again and take out another refund advance loan).
q0oZ8eOzaa	Yes - Working in any job situation that shows compromised morals is a big negative. At some point in the application process they may investigate your past employment history and if this comes up you are dead as far as an employment opportunity. Every job possibility is there for you to lose. If you do anything to raise a red flag with an employer there are 100 other people who will be waiting outside to get the job. Especially right now with so many good people out of work. Employers have enough problem employees already they will not take a chance on another one.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	It may only make a difference if you tell them.

5BTKscZraa	Of course settlement is an option.  If the original creditor still has it, offer 50%...if it's with a debt collector, offer 25%.     If you can get 50% settlements...that takes the debt down to $7,500...then apply the $2,000 or so that you'd spend to file for BK and you'd have a very manageable amount of debt in the $5K range.    FYI:  - You can never predict how any creditor will respond to your settlement offer. They have the right to take legal action on any debt that is within the statute of limitations.   - Settling debt is still a huge negative on your credit...and even after paying back $7K+ you're still going to have horrible credit.  - forgiven debt must be added to your next years income and you will have to paying higher taxes.    Tough decision to make about what is the best option. If you file for Chapter 7, make sure it's REALLY a financial emergency. Once you file, you can't file again for EIGHT more years.

Bqi7jmsPaa	The $1 is Paypal  verifying your bank account.  They usually deposit a dollar, or perhaps now they take a dollar out and put it in your paypal account.    This is just to verify that the checking account is legitimate and that you gave them information for YOUR checking account.    There is no reason it would not show up in your PayPal account.  It will take 24 hours to actually come out of your checking account as all transactions at a bank are processed shortly after midnight each day.  Trust me, that amount, even though it didn't show up immediately in your on-line bank account, is no longer available for withdrawal by you.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Paypal to bank (and vice versa) transactions take about 3 working days to show up.
384c780bb91cade837c91d9b70f47c38aa	yes if your account goes into a dormant state, federal law requires banks to charge a 5 dollar fee and sometimes that can lead to accounts to go negative and be sent to collections and then they close the account. Or if the account is just negative they can just close it.
eACZ1Rhjaa	Mine was built in 1948 and has some fine quality. Heavy woodwork and a red brick exterior, plaster walls and arched doorways. But it is 60 years old and circuit breakers break if you use the dishwasher and microwave at the same time the patio is 60 and starting to crack and the driveway too. I like a nice sturdy house but would like a better plumbing and electrical system.   I would only buy new if I wanted a feature I couldn't find used.

wQJBFcluaa	You might be able to get free milk from the farmer.Put your cutest Elly May outfit on and flirt with him and see.|`|AA10274297	It is true that "small" farms are exempt from paying overtime.  The definition of small is using less than 500 man-hours in any quarter of the preceding year (this works out to about 5 or 6 workers).  The owner and his relatives are not considered in this total.  This exemption seems unfair to me, but evidently when the act requiring overtime pay was passed in 1966, small farms were exempt from the beginning.    Unfortunately, there is no special tax break or credit to compensate the farm worker for the lack of overtime pay.

C3LiKhm8aa	I don't know the capital structure of the company, but it seems to me that the "buyers" are asking you to give them half the company in return for a capital infusion.    Your accountant has it right.  If you are selling half the company, then you are selling half your stock.    You could well issue them new stock in return for a capital infusion, but that wouldn't give you any money in your pocket.    I would find a very good lawyer and sit down with him and your accountant and figure out what the options are and what you want to do.  Don't let the "buyers" stampede you into a decision.    The danger is that now that you have started negotiations you will be under a lot of pressure to "do a deal."  These things take on a life of their own, and the books are full of people who didn't have the courage to say NO.  Also be aware that there will be a lot fof pressure to do not only a deal, but a deal on some terms close to the original terms.    As an example, if you get an offer for $40, the "buyers" will expect your response to be some reasonable amount different from $40, say $50.  Maybe the real number should be $100.  Well, in the context of $40, $100 is unreasonable.  But so what?  Why is $40 the magic number?  That's their number, not yours.  Just say no and move on.    The bottom line is that it's your company and you can sell it for what you want on the terms you want.  The "buyers" will call you all sorts of names, but so what?  Read "Emotional Blackmail," by Susan Forward.  It'll open your eyes to the manipulations people use, especially in negotiations.      You should read up a bit on the psychology of these things so you don't find yourself with a bad deal at the end of the day.;    Good luck.|`|it3WLDTKaa	The only way to get money out is by paying yourself a salary/bonus or a dividend.    Because they would then own 50% of your company I'm assuming they are now directors in the company with you, so they have half the voting rights and wouldn't allow you to pay yourself a salary/bonus.    They'd have to approve your dividend payout, which they are entitled to 50% of since they own 50% of the shares. If they have no say in the operations of the company, sell them 49% of the company and you can still make the decisions.
eACZ1Rhjaa	If you don't owe it you have a chance to defend yourself. If you can't they will get a judgment and if you don't pay it they will garnish your pay or take from your bank account. The judgment can be renewed usually so won't be affected by the SOL. You may want to file bankruptcy before they can get a judgment if you can't pay it.  You can call and offer  to set up a payment plan but they already have court cost so aren't likely to cancel it now. Settlement would have been before they have to resort the courts. If you agree to a payment plan and quit paying they would just have to go back to court to get a judgment. Most people don't stop a judgment once they start it isn't worth it.|`|56b2673c86699181557ab8de443fae51aa	First of all you would be submitting your defense basis in writing.

They are banking on the fact that you will do nothing, not address this and not show up. They will then get a default judgement which they can garnish your wages if your state permits such a thing. If you play this right you can buy yourself a lot of time and they will most likely offer a settlement at a much reduced rate with a payment plan.

4mmTyMglaa	Have you checked this site yet?  http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0...    It has good information for you.    Just go ahead and fill out the referal form, Form 3949-A  but the IRS will never let you know what became of your report.      They will not discuss any ongoing investigations and the only way you would hear about the outcome is if the person told you himself or if it makes the news.      Even the basic procedures involved in an IRS investigation are not public information.  Here is what I can tell you:    -i know someone who is not reporting income from a business   that they operate "on the side" -  which is done outside their normal work,   so if i send a letter to the irs reporting that person for tax fraud/tax evasion,   how long will it take the irs to start investigating my claim of tax evasion/tax fraud?     Depends how serious the case is.  They are always busy and it takes at least a month for most "ordinary taxpayer" issues to get reviewed.    2-what will the investigation procedure be? will they call the person i am reporting?   will they send them a letter? will they visit the person's home?     They will not call.  They generally start with letters requesting the information and/or visits to the business location.    3-i did not have the person's social security number so i think   i could give some addresses and a phone number that might help   them track the person along with the person's name and the alleged activity   that is associated with the tax fraud.     All the IRS needs is a name and zip code and they can pull up the file.     4-what happens to this person if the irs finds that this person   owes the irs money? how much trouble will they get into?    They will get a bill and/or prison time depending on the seriousness of the crime.|`|wQJBFcluaa	You are either on a personal vendetta against this person or you are trying to get some brownie points with the IRS.Which is it?|`|AA10469473	There's no real way to answer your question.

VmrzLdNcaa	dynomite_1998, I've found a local list of property management services in Oregon. I'd suggest contacting one of them to see if you can get your questions answered by a professional. http://www.propertymanagementvacationren...
ww12lItvaa	First, I save KUDOS to you for wanting to save and invest!      Many people never see the benefit or are not willing to reduce their lifestyle any now for benefits later.     Here is my idea.     Save up at least $3,000 in a saving account and then put it in a mutual fund. This gives you a professional making the decisions while you learn to invest for yourself over time, as much as you want to do that.     Starting out my suggestion is to have the interest and capital gains automatically go in to your checking account to spend. Starting out your income and tax rates are usually low, so tax (which includes retirement savings) or compounding considerations are less important and that will come later. Tax saving will be more important when you income is higher and be of greater value. Also it will easier to save for retirement if you already have taxable investments.     I suggest a high yield income fund or bond fund for doing this. The reason is to firmly establish the concept that more you save the more you have to spend. It is to reward you for saving and investing.    I started with a Ginne Mae fund and a Junk bond fund. If I invested $500 it paid me $3 a month. Sounds not like much. Such is the reality starting out. I cut all my expenses to the bone so I could save that $500 a month. Cut out cable TV, magazines (I went to the library for free), no newspaper (my neighbors gladly gave me theirs a day old), and so on. But then I used the money coming in to buy back all those things over time and considered the spending money my investments produced to be "free". And in a sense it was.     $500 to get $3.33 a month seems like nothing, I realize. But not if you consider how it builds. That was $40 a year.  BUT it was $500 a month more invested so at the end of a year it becomes $480 a year, $960 the second year, $1,440 the third year and so on. Sound better?    And as my income grew, it became $1000 a month, then $2k, $3k, and $4k a month. Which I could do more easily with that other money coming in. It compounded in that way. The more I got the more I could save.    And now I winter in Hawaii after retiring early at a young-ish age.     I know this was long and not exactly your question, but I wanted to suggest in deciding how to start investing that you reward yourself for saving because most people stop or are not so motivated to save and invest if their money just "goes away" and becomes a number on a page.     And that first $500 I added to my first mutual fund? It is still there and paying about the same $3 decades later having paid back that first $500 several times over time.       And to think it started with that meager $3 a month return.    What I am suggesting is not dissimilar to the way the "millionaire next door" make their money.    I had two main points. Live below your means and reward yourself for saving and investing.    Good Luck|`|bfa5e0b2aa86c9ae1c884c351880a0bdaa	education, visit your local library particularly section 331, and read a bunch.|`|e96cc2ca7d9e9ee846c6e1a829fb3b89aa	I would first get educated on some of the most basic forms of investing such as the stock market,cd's bonds n etc.I would then depending on what your risk tolerance is choose an investment that would meet your needs.Are you looking for income ,for an investment to grow ,dividends or something like that.I would recommend rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki.This is an excellent book to start out investing with.Also check out http://www.investopedia.com they have all sorts of articles on investing learning tools n such.Stock Investing for Dummies - Paul Mladjenovic,Investing for Dummies,Real Money by Jim Cramer are few other good books I recommend.I would also speak with an investment/financial advisor they could also give you a few pointers on the basics of investing.That should get you started on the basics then you can work up from there to the more advanced investing techniques.Hope this is of some help to you n the best of luck.

AA10274297	You can claim it... actually receiving it might be tougher.  The standard requirement is that unemployment insurance must have been paid on your earnings, and the self-employed don't pay unemployment insurance for themselves.    I suggest you get the form, answer all the questions on it truthfully, and send it in.  They will probably deny your claim for benefits.  But the reason for filing the claim is to make it more likely to qualify for any extended benefits that may occur as a result of the stimulus bills.  First of all, there have been proposals to extend unemployment benefits to the self-employed, even though they haven't paid into the system.  And secondly, there is a program that gives states an option to pay for some self-employment activities, including entrepreneurial training, business assistance, and technical assistance.  Only 7 states have such a program, but more states might do it as part of economic recovery.  Typically whenever unemployment benefits are expanded, it only applies to existing (and not future) claims.    So as long as you answer all the questions truthfully, there is no harm in applying for unemployment benefits, and there is a chance that it could be to your advantage to do so.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	visit your local unemployment office or go to the state's website for real answers.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	no because you were self employed, and no because you chose to stop working. sorry.|`|iLd3Y2fiaa	I don't know if there are differences from state to state, but here in Michigan, you would not be able to claim unemployment because you chose to stop working.|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Did you pay unemployment insurance?  If not, your business and any employees of that business are not covered by unemployment insurance.

The only way you would be eligible to receive unemployment benefits is if you had been an employee and an employer had paid the unemployment insurance premiums on you. As someone who was self-employed, you would not have been allowed to pay the insurance premiums for yourself.    So, no, you won't qualify for unemployment.

vSiulYddaa	they have done alot to stop foreclosures, standards in the courts have changed alot - having nothin to do wtih law alone - the courts are so backed up that they are contining cases for months before allowing a foreclosure, while the home owner has the rights of redemption the whole time. Towns ans cities have also put a halt to foreclosure for tax levies.   Thing is many people borrowed to much money to purhase their overpriced home- what is the goverment suppose to do about that?? I mean they are the ones who borroed the money , they are the ones who decided to pay that amount for a house, the money was paid out and the money is still due....  What is the government suppose to step in and say - its ok that you paid 700 grand for that house that is now worth 200 grand , dont worry about payin that back we will???  The whole ordeal sucks - our economy sucks.  I know guys at work that are being laid off or on the verge of being laid off while they have 3 kids and a mortgage.   Like i said our economy sucks , but realisticly - our government is doing all that it can.  Realisticly - when house prices went through the roof - people should have had enough common sense not to buy a house - they should have done their due diligence, they should have educated themselves , or waited to make a purchase untill they took the time to do so.   Besides take a look at the big picture - by our governenment giving bail out money to all those big banks that we hate - they are EVENLY passing it out to us....Interest rates have dropped, stanadards for getting a loan or refinancing your 'bad' mortgage - have simply changed.   If you cant afford your house before these bails outs - you might actually be able to afford it now.  Its nobodys fault that people purchased more than they could afford, or agreed to a loan they know they couldnt afford in a few months.

LqSciCrhaa	Jawd I would definitely start investigating the issue.    1.  Start writing down the details of what you bought and when you bought it.  Write down when you received it and how it was when received.  Take pictures as well.  You are creating a time-line for what's going on.  Write down your phone calls (day, time and person you spoke with).    2.  Read over the terms of service so you can inform them of what they are violating.    3.  Don't waste time with low level people, they can't help you.  Demand a supervisor.    4.  Don't give up.  Demand that they refund the original equipment, the re-stocking fee and tell them that you are filing a law suit if they don't also refund what you didn't authorize them to take out.    5.  Be calm when you call but let them know that you won't stand for it.      6.  If you have a lawyer call him and get him to call as well.  Many lawyers are willing to fire a warning shot at companies and that often will do the trick.    4.
Bqi7jmsPaa	It depends on the type of bankruptcy she is filing.    In a Chapter 13, you have to repay some of the debt you owe.  The amount you repay depends on your income and cash on hand at the date of the filing.    A lawyer will tell you to get rid of the cash in checking/savings accounts (but NOT retirement accounts) or the bankruptcy trustee will take it.  So perhaps she's spending the money as the lawyer advised her to do.    Let her know that NOTHING her father is providing for her should be mentioned at the bankruptcy hearing.  Her lawyer should have already informed her of this.    In either bankruptcy, it is unusual for the court to demand personal belongings be sold and the money handed over.  If you have valuable art or an expensive coin collection, or you've invested in diamonds, then those assets would most likely have to go.    But your household items, clothing, appliances, etc. are not really worth too much when sold as used, and you value each item at what you could get for it if you had to sell it today, so there isn't really much danger of that happening.  She should just leave the listed property the way she submitted it.    Since I'm assuming she has an attorney, that's the person she should talk to about this.  In some states you can't file bankruptcy without going through an attorney.|`|3r1TwMCQaa	If everything is in her dad's name it should not count towards the bankruptcy. However her creditors (if they want to give them a hard time) can have this purchase investigated.

I am not a lawyer so I can't guarantee you my information is 100% accurate but I know a little bit about bankruptcies.

Lk4R1pkZaa	You really should be analysing the market and asking if this is the right time to be investing.   The dow is down 40% for the last year  Just this week,we had the financial news that unemployment insurance claims were the highest in 25 years.Also this week,  that new housing starts were the lowest since 1963.CNN are running a daily figure on layoff announcements by major companies-over 100,000 so far this week.  It is hardly likely that we are seeing the bottom just now.Things are obviously going to get worse,and that especially includes stocks.  Your strategies are limited to 2 things.  1.Capital preservation-in short term treasury notes.Interest rates of 0.2% and the safest investment there is.At least you wont be on the emotional roller coaster of watching stocks go down.You stay parked there till the economic numbers turn up-specifically housing values increase,and unemployment numbers start falling.  2.Short stocks because things are going to get worse.Specifically bank stocks.Bank stocks are linked to housing values. As housing values continue to fall further,people will walk away from unaffordable mortages and the banks will be stuck with massive debts.Some banks will go bust,and bank stocks will fall a lot further yet.You could also short just about any manufacturing company eg.Ford havent asked for any bailout money-yet-but as things get worse,they will.  Be patient-when the financial numbers turn-specifically an increase in housing values,and a decrease in unemployment numbers-maybe 1/2 years-it will be the best buying opportunity you will ever see.|`|bfa5e0b2aa86c9ae1c884c351880a0bdaa	don't know your age or risk tolerance, but 50% in investment grade corporate bonds structured into a ladder and 50% in dividend paying stocks would be most appropriate for the average middle ager.

I recommend to get such agreement thru credit repair agency, for example this one - freecreditreport.hotusa.org|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It starts immediately.

Then you will have net profit or loss.  You can use your total net loss to reduce your income by up to $3,000. You can carryover the unused part to the next year and treat it as if you had incurred in that next year. When you carry over a loss, it remains long term or short term. A long term capital loss you carry over to the next tax year will reduce that year's long-term capital gains before it reduces that year's short-term capital gains. When you are figuring your capital loss carryover, use your short-term capital losses first.

CDHrN5UPaa	Getting VC financing is very difficult particularly in the current economic environment. They are looking for the combination of a compelling product/technology and the technical and managerial talent to make it a reality. It is often more about the team and the ability to build a business around either a new technology, product(s) or a powerful business model that it is a specific idea.    Its important to understand that VCs primarily invest in great management teams and/or exceptional technologists. Generally, you need to have either several years of senior corporate experience in the right area for your venture or be a technical expert in the field of your products/business model. If you don't want to wait until you acquire the knowledge yourself, you need to recruit it into your team.    Another important element is a well-thought presentation and one needs to be prepared to answer questions about the market, competition, budget, regulatory requirements, manufacturing, etc. in addition to questions about the core technology and product(s).

O4gMKi1baa	Demand is decreasing because the economy keeps getting bad (people loosing jobs, businesses going bankrupt, etc...).  This decrease in demand is causing an increase in supply which is causing the gas prices to fall.  As a result OPEC has begun cutting oil production in order to decrease supplies and increase oil prices.  Although these oil production cuts have been good at stabilizing oil prices, it has not been able to cause a major increase in oil prices because the economy is still getting worse so the demand is still decreasing.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Because of The lack of Demand due to the recession in US,UK,EURO zone and japan and slowdown in world economy there is lack of demand hence inspite of production cuts by OPEC the crude is down.

The address on your checks should match the address on your driver's license.  Look for a bank that will offer to "buy" your old checks from a previous bank.  It's a lure to get you to become one of their customers, but it's better than nothing!
9YzgrwoQaa	I wanted the same thing when I took high school drafting. I did go on to get an associates in mechanical drafting; computers were just beginning. I started working in Houston when Auto-CAD opened with a blank screen, and the first thing to do was define a point in space. I worked at a place that manufactured seals for the oil fields; non-contact seals were fun but it seemed that we were working ourselves out of bread and butter. I applied at NASA many times, I would have even taken a job there as janitor. Time passed and my dream did not come through. I don't feel sorry for myself; I own  a great company in transportation which utilizes most of my skills. With what is going on in the space industry now I hope to see more trying in the private field. Sounds like the movie Astronaut Farmer; there are people making real progress. It doesn't take much to take ideas from the government and improve on them. With information and computer programs available now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to build a rocket. Be prepared though if I can start getting time away from running my company I may be your competition!!

I have EXCELLENT records of how my business.  I have records of births, sales, feed, fencing, mineral, and records of my sales to customers.    I can sell my farm out (over 100 productive does) AND a fellow goat farmer who has over 300 productive does!      Not one single resource (bank, agricultural institution, ect) is willing to "take a chance" on something "risky" like goats.  They only stick with the tried and true livestock, like chickens, beef, dairy cows, and pigs.  You know...they only give loans to the livestock that is subsidized by the Government.

Try your Department of Agriculture.  Many have beginning loan programs with low interest loans and grants available.      The USDA also gives loans and grants to small farmers.  Try your extension agent in your area.  They may be able to help you access financial help.      Farm Credit Services is an option sometimes.  In our area, grants and low to no interest loans are available through our Department of Agricluture.      Also, the American Meat Goat Association offers grants, etc...from time to time.  The link for the 2008 grant options is: http://www.meatgoats.com/rotator.php?art...  You would need to contact them on the 2009.

This means banks.  Next (and some people prefer) to deal with Credit Union Banks as they are more conservative and also have a community around the Credit Union.  You'll receive the best rates with these people if your credit and net worth fall within the parameters of their lending practices.    The Sub-Prime market should be avoided if at all possible.  The interest rates are much higher (Finance Companies; these are private lenders, and some are public companies; yet not in the "bank" world and they play by different rules)    For a mortgage it would be best to be with a bank or credit union.

Also before you decide to go with given PSU bank, get opinion from few customer holding home loan account with that bank since more then 3 years.

AA11752525	Hey Maaaan,                        No problem. Most states make it nearly impossible to foreclose against a personal residence. Many complicating factors including joint tenancies in the property and only a single judgment creditor.                        In most cases the complexity and cost trying to foreclose convince creditors to merely consider a judgment to be an involuntary lien to be collected only after the property is transferred or sold.                         In the meantime you will have multiple opportunities to try to work out a payment arrangement with your creditor for much less than full judgment value.                        Remember you also have state or federal exemption that may save you from turning over the full measure of your equity.                        Should you find yourself in this situation retain someone expert in asset protection (Attorney or Accountant). They will fully examine your situation and protect you to the maximum possible.                        Good luck.|`|1P3usILUaa	Sorry to hear your news.

I joined a program about 7 months ago i was laid off from my job, i went onto this site here looking for suggestions and one of the websites someone gave me actually turned out to be the best thing i could of came across.  its a program that shows you step by step and its all videos, he shows you how to make money fast if in need of cash.  but he also teaches you how to stay successful and gives every website for your marketing, advertising affiliate programs, anything you can imagine he gives you.  he offers some free videos and in these videos he gives you websites to advertise in that are free, its where i actually started off and made my first profit and after making that little amount of money, i started to put more effort and time and it has paid off, i know work from home and im very grateful to have come across this site because i have a 12year old disabled girl and for the first time i don't have to worry about who is going to watch her or take care of her while im working because im home with her and its an awesome accomplishment for me.

They make it almost impossible to make money online.    You really have to think about what you are doing before you buy any product that goes over the top and that will spam your inbox of your email account. You should be very skeptical until you do a certain amount of research. As far as reviewing products go, this could be as easy as doing a search on any of the search engines to find anything negative and reading reviews that others are giving on that specific e book or course.    Doing article marketing or affiliate marketing can be very rewarding if you get the right course or teacher. There really are some decent people out there who are willing to help you succeed - they are not all bad. Saying this now these people are not easy to find.
AEnXejqzaa	Hello, Gomer!  Well, I can provide you just a little bit of comfort in knowing there are literally thousands of us in that boat right now. Original dd date jan 30th and then feb 3rd and now it just recently changing to feb 10th or in some people's cases feb 24. There are many different questions and answers requarding this subject that are rolling around. I am very stressed about this too. The only thing that is keeping me somewhat sane is knowing that I am very much so not alone. Think about all the people that are getting the same messages as you and I, the irs cant be keeping all of our refunds..lol.. I am going to go with an answer that I read to another question earlier...this is just a glitch and your refund should be deposited on the original date, in our case Jan 30th. I am keeping my fingers crossed for all of us and I plan to update as soon as I find ANYTHING different. Also if you can go into my profile and look at the question I answered earlier today there are about 20 other people that have experienced this and maybe some of the answers there will be of help to you.

Ok so I called the iRS sat on hold for 45 minutes to hear that it take 3 weeks to process..I said well your chart shows if i am accepted by a certain date then i should get it by the 30th.SHe said it has not been processed and if i dont get it by the 30th then i just need to wait the 3 weeks..Mine went from the 3rd to the 24th..|`|Zu0ejE8vaa	I efiled on 1/17 and the irs accepted it on1/19. It said I will recieve it by Jan 30 by DD. Today it changed to February 24, 2009. I called the irs the first guy told me I will recieve within 21 days. I called back and the guy said that it's delayed possibly due to my high earned income. But my earned income is only 22,000. That is not high. So I don't know what's going on either.

R4v7Xvynaa	I know this is not the answer you are looking for but I think when it comes to finding a realtor, word of mouth is your best advertising tool.  So keep your current clients happy and give them lots of business cards and monogrammed pens.    The only other thing I can think of is advertising on a military base if there is one close to you.  There is usually a newsletter that is specific to that base that you can put an ad in.  New personnel are constantly moving in, looking for homes, and have a guaranteed source of income and financing (the VA).  People on military bases are constantly moving a way as well and looking to sell or rent their homes.  So, if you have not looked into it and have a military base close to you, look into advertising there.    Best of luck!|`|j9gPEzEhaa	Well, that's a nice question and I wonder why competitors would share strategy :-? Clients may not be group members.

aHmAZeoqaa	1. I'm AGAINST outsourcing low-level jobs such as Customer Service Rep or IT Help Desk.  I'm FOR outsourcing high-end jobs in the Technology and Engineering fields.<br>  <br>  2. Foreign Customer Service is just plain bad, and bad for the image of the company.  For high-end jobs, such as Software Engineering, Asians outperform Westerners.  China and India have a culture that values education.  (I'm not putting down our culture, we value creativity and we're very innovative.)  The fact is, their kids outperform our kids.<br>  <br>  3. Outsourcing helps the GLOBAL economy balance out in terms of jobs and salaries.  It is helpful to Indian, China, and Singapore's economies because they have more jobs and higher salaries.  <br>  As far as the U.S. economy is concerned, it is helpful to corporations since they save money by shipping jobs to areas where salaries are low.   For them, lower Salaries Expense = Higher Net Income.  But overall, it is harmful to our economy because, since our jobs are shipped overseas, we have fewer job opportunities and lower salaries.

Wy47JwOQaa	A) the quantity of labor supplied will increase because an increase in income potential results in more people willing to do it.  When something becomes more profitable, it becomes more demanded.    B) The quantity of labor demanded will decrease or remain the same, because the expense per person number would have gone up.  When something is more expensive (labor costs), demand for it (labor) goes down.  Simple Economics.    C) The number of unemployed fast food workers in your city will most likely increase.  Judging just from the two questions above, it appears that your city will see an increase is possible people to fill this job, and the need for their efforts will go down.

Bqi7jmsPaa	You are always charged the listing fee plus charges for any extra features you used in your listing.  That is in the user agreement you "agreed to" before eBay would allow you to sign up.    There is nothing you can do.  You can, of course, close your account but you will still owe them the fees and they can take appropriate action to collect those fees.    If you advertise items in the newspaper want ads and nobody calls to purchase them, the newspaper doesn't give your money back.  Neither does eBay.    If you re-list, and the items sell the second time around, you will get a credit for the second listing fee (what it cost you to re-list).  If they don't sell the second time, then you end up paying the fees twice.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	There are four closing entries, which transfer all temporary account balances to the owner's capital account.   1. Close the income statement accounts with credit balances (normally revenue accounts) to a special temporary account named income summary.     2. Close the income statement accounts with debit balances (normally expense accounts) to the income summary account. After all revenue and expense accounts are closed, the income summary account's balance equals the company's net income or loss for the period.    3. Close income summary to the owner's capital account or, in corporations, to the retained earnings account. The purpose of the income summary account is simply to keep the permanent owner's capital or retained earnings account uncluttered.    4. Close the owner's drawing account to the owner's capital account. In corporations, this entry closes any dividend accounts to the retained earnings account. For purposes of illustration, closing entries for the Greener Landscape Group follow.    Click on the link for illustrations.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

pt6wIlS1aa	Maybe, but maybe not. Why do you think you are overstaffed?     If you and others have a lot of time when you're not working, then maybe they would need fewer people. But maybe they need that many people so they're there when things get busy. If you have a lot of down time, use it to learn the job better, so you are asking for less help and can contribute more. Or volunteer to do some tasks while you're waiting for customers.    Sometimes companies hire lots of people so they can keep them all at part-time, This way, they don't have to pay them benefits. If they need to lay people off, they might choose to lay off the full-timers and keep people like you.    It can't hurt to ask your boss what he most wants you to learn or improve so you're a more valuable employee. It shows you care about keeping your job and lets him know you're trying to be better.|`|dZtToTIbaa	Well of course its possible but I don't think they'll let ya go.

As for the overstaffed issue, they would usually do the whole "last in, first out" theory. Have others been working there for a shorter time? If so then they might let those people go first. I'm sure that most employers would prefer a worker that asks questions over one that just gives up. You are doing the best you can! :)
ZeDjn4cVaa	If you liabilities were greater  than your assets, then you will be able to exclude part or all of the forgiven debt from your income.  To do this you will need to file form 982 and attach a statement of discharge of indebtedness with your tax return.    These forms are complicated so you might want to seek professional advice.

See my profile for more information.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Read IRS pub 4681.|`|AA11284831	If you were insolvent at the time of the Cancellation of Debt then the COD is not taxable to the extent that you are insolvent.  You are insolvent if the value of your assets is less than your liabilities.    For example if the value of your assets is $100k and you owe $107k then you are insolvent by $7k.  With a $10k COD, $3k would be taxable.    I usually suggest professional assistance as you need to submit a simple set of financial statements to substantiate your insolvency.  If you're not familiar with the basics of accounting and bookkeeping this can be a hassle.

It is questionable whether you will get paid for the day you got fired; only you know if you did any work that day.|`|1Ih01vPIaa	They can keep your last check for up to 30 days for any reason, they don't even have to give you a reason.  But then they have to pay you after that time.  They could argue that you cost them money by quiting, but most don't bother doing that.  Your only option now is to ask where's my check.|`|3d754706b71af3fa041a3539bdbc5917aa	Most companies regognize three days of 'no call/no show' as job abandonment.    They have to pay you for time worked, generally within three days of your 'notice'.  You need to look at your pay cycle and see if you we're at the start of a new cycle.  If you were and they sent you home due to you being in non-compliance with a company policy, you didn't 'work', so noting is owed to you.     However, if you worked hours, prior to the time you were asked to comply with the policy, then you are owed that money.  Send a nice letter to your supervisor and their manager or call and speak to them in a nice manner and get it resolved in a polite fashion.    In the future, follow the policy that you agreed too when you were hired and never walk out on the jobthats giving zero notice and not only frustrates your boss, but all of your co-workers who had to work extra to make up for you leaving them in the lurch.
wVkJ5jTfaa	It is not bad.   It is good that you have a score at all with your short credit history.  It will improve with time, if you always pay your bills and don't open too many new credit accounts at once.   Over time one of the things that seems to make a difference in the score is having long term credit.   A department store card that you don't really use, but have had for several years has a large positive effect.

3iZaJF9Saa	The problem is not the UAW,it is the unfair trade laws the US has.No other country in the world has trade laws like the US.Japan is allowed to import all the vehicles it wants and gets a tax break then the US is limited to the number of vehicles it can export to Japan and these vehicles are highly taxed.<br>  Then when gas went sky high the US companies didn't have enough gas saving vehicles to compete with imports.When SUV's and truck's stopped selling it hurt these companies because that is where they made most of their money.<br>  Then these companies do have investments which lost a lot of their values just like people 401K's lost value.The price of their stocks dropped which gave them less operating capital and it became costly or impossible for these companies to borrow money to operate.<br>  The US auto companies are not the only ones hurting,Toyota has borrowed $2 billion dollars from the Japanese Government and Nissan is also asking for funding.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Basic problems are that the unions made them uncompetitive and they build way too many cars that no one wants.|`|hjuAxCdBaa	Companies like GM are outsourcing which means that they move their factories out of the country. For example: the GM factory in Flint, Michigan was moved to Mexico because the company wanted to hire Mexican workers who would work for much less money. This caused many people in the Flint area to lose jobs. This is just one example of many.  Outsourcing causes Americans to lose jobs which causes the economy to worsen because less people have work which means less people spend money.

Then again perhaps they don't want to be a part of the Obama socialism experiment.

So you could invest in an oil company or refinery as a hedge against your own gas consumption.  That way, if gas prices go up, you make money on your investment.  If gas prices go down, you save money on your car.

This strategy is called a protective put & reduces downside risk from declines in microsoft's stock price.

AA10159748	While 14 & 15 year olds can legally work, federal restrictions on employers on how much they can work these minors, how often they must be afforded breaks, what hours they can be scheduled between, etc., make it very problematic for those employers to hire kids that age.  <br>  <br>  The majority of employers simply won't hire anyone under 16, because that's where federal restrictions stop becoming such an inconvenience for them.  They also know that older teens are more reliable & generally can provide their own transportation.  That proves another hazard - many employers don't want to hire folks who can't drive, because leaving them to arrange for someone to bring them to work doesn't guarantee their attendance. <br>  <br>  In the end, it's just less taxing and more economical for employers to forego minors under 16 years of age.

16vMIGPiaa	If you are seriously looking at the kind of business that requires a $2 million loan, asking on Y!A is like looking for financial advice at a pub.    You will be much better off to get the serious attention of serious advisors.  Assuming you're in the US, start with you local Small Business Administration ( http://www.SBA.gov ).  You have to have a BUSINESS PLAN before you lift a finger to even think about financing.  Otherwise you're putting the cart in front of the horse.  Go interview several accountants that have clients in the business area you're considering.  You're going to want an accountant anyway.  Check them out with the Better Business Bureau ( http://www.BBB.org )    And for gawd's sake please Report each and every one of the Nigeria 419 scam loan offers you get.

vqdurAA5aa	I am assuming you are talking about brokerages in the United States.    I am not sure what you mean by "leveraged options trading."     If you mean trading options positions that create a leveraged position in the underlying security, essentially all brokers allow it in accounts that have been approved to trade options.  (To get an account approved to trade options you have to meet certain requirements that vary between brokerages.)    Most brokerages have different authorization levels for options trading.  The level on your account determines which types of options trades are allowed.     If you mean allowing margin on long option positions, the SEC strictly limits the maximum a brokerage can allow in most accounts. The brokerage cannot allow any margin for an option expiring in nine months or less. If you own an options that has more than nine months until expiry the SEC will allow a brokerage to use a small amount of margin from the option, but the SEC never requires a brokerage to grant margin.  I do not know which brokerages grant margin on long term options.    The best way to get around the SEC "Regulation T" margin requirements is to ger a "risk based" margin account instead of a "rule based" margin account. For risk based margin systems, exchanges consider the maximum one day risk on all the positions in a complete portfolio, or subportfolio together (for example, a future and all the options delivering that future). If you know what you are doing, a risk based margin account will allow you to use more leverage.    The only brokerage that I am certain offers risk based margin accounts is Interactive Brokers, but I assume a lot of others offer them as well. Just remember that more leverage you use the more likely you are are to be wiped out.
3d754706b71af3fa041a3539bdbc5917aa	If it's more than unemployment, you need to ask yourself what else you would be doing with the time?  Are you working on getting some side gigs or setting up a consulting practice?  If so, then it may be worth it to see if you can make that fly.    However, if you're not doing those things, then take the job, perform like a super star.  Only good can come from that.  Good luck!    As a reminder to all of us, unemployment is 'insurance'.  It's not a 'benefit' like many people think it is.  So take advantage of the time ti buys you to make a good decision, that works for you and those that depend on you.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOT FREE MONEY.  Your previous employer put some of his money with some of your money in the form of payroll taxes.  Those taxes went into a fund designed to give you  a boost financially in the event you got caught between jobs (like you are), so you would not be forced to work for substandard wages  and be able to get another decent job.  Additionally food stamps and other benefits are there for the same reason.  I agree these have been abused terribly by a great many, but These are benefits YOU paid for and you are morally and legally entitled to draw them.  So do it with pride, because you are and again soon will be a taxpayer.    Secondly: do the math before making this decision.  You have to consider also on an average you will spend part of your paycheck going to and from work and possibly eating a meal while at work, or snacks, or the like. So the low pay is even lower than you may think.  If the actual job pays more than your benefits, take the job.  If not, don't take the job.  It's basically that simple.      Even if the unemployment rate jumps to 10% (which it may), that means that 90% still have jobs out there to be had.  Most employers use times like these to weed out bad employees and replace them with better.  So the odds of finding a job are still in your favor. You may have to look a little farther, but don't get stuck in a bad job.|`|806455f30adefbff1e3b1fbdc3ecc722aa	Suppose your unemployment is $300/week. You are offered a job that pays $200/week. You do not lose the full $300/week. You will still get some unemployment. The amount varies by state, but the minimum you would get is $100/week, so you would be no worse off financially by taking the job. In some states, you can even earn up to an amount before you start losing any benefit, and in some states, you lose $1 for every $2 earned, so you would never lose financially by taking the lower paying job.     Second, you will be able to collect longer if you do not take the full benefit each week. Suppose you could collect for 12 weeks. If you only collect half the amount each week, you can collect for 24 weeks. The lower paying job can help stretch your benefits. The benefit isn't really measured in weeks, it's measured in dollars. You really qualify for the amount that would equal full weekly draws for 12 months, but can collect it over a full year.     Finally, it's always easier to find a job if you have a job. Working the lower paying job will put structure in your life and make you more likely to get a new job. Many people get a foot in the door at very low pay only to wow the employer and move up quickly.     Unless you are lining up enough interviews to spend 40-hours/week going from employer to employer, there doesn't seem to be any down side to taking the job.|`|7kImYZfOaa	work and receive the tax credit. the reason why the economy is so bad is because everyone wants free money... and every penny is worth something. if its more than unemployment take it..go out on a saturday and enjoy

Assuming it is included, and assuming advalorem tax is 10% (random),  you take 42.99 you divide it by 1.1, you get $39.08 which then gives you a sales tax of $3.91.    And if it is a fixed tax, assuming they put a tax of $5 on the item, then that is the sales tax itself.    If the $42.99 does not include the sales tax, for advalorem it will be (assuming tax rate is 10%), 10% multiplies by 42.99 which gives you $4,29 which is the sales tax...

I also earned as much interest as possible by getting an interest free loan for a month with my credit card and keeping my money in a savings account as long as possible.

afa39a804ae93594034f326d518e6d8faa	Don't do an emergency fund yet, if you have an emergency your debt will eat you up now. So get rid of the debt. Here is how:    Sell the car. For half or less than your remaining car payment you can get a used car that will do the job. Make sure that however you decide to sell it, that it covers at least the loan's outstanding balance. Hopefully you can make a gain, but the most important thing is to get rid of the $10,000@10% loan. That will kill you in an emergency. Then pay off your aunt. Depending on how you dispose of it (I don't know enough of your facts to say for sure) you may be able to buck the debt and pay for a cheap used car (or depending on where you live, a scooter) with some additional gain to help with the aunt. Be sure to pay your aunt back as quickly as you can with a little extra to compensate her for helping you. Then bake her cookies, make a card and say thank you. That way if you run into trouble before you finish your emergency fund, she will be more than willing to help you out again, remembering you are a trustworthy and responsible person.    Then save up your emergency fund, lay aside at least 10% per paycheck until you have accumulated $2000 (it is a nice round number and increases the margin of error a small amount. Nothing is static, so include a margin for error in everything.).    Be sure to put a portion of your emergency fund into silver to make sure that you will still have some capital if the dollar collapses.    Best of luck to you!|`|Bqi7jmsPaa	And where would you be getting this money to pay off your car?    It would be nice to have a year's expenses tucked away somewhere in case of an emergency, but I don't know a single soul personally who has that (and I know one heck of a lot of people in my business).      I would certainly strive to get as much as possible and in today's economy three months might not be enough.  The unemployment rate is the highest it has been in 20 years.  Jobs are very difficult to come by right now.|`|9XrGIirVaa	Whichever way you go, you will still be broke.  My suggestion is that you keep your car payments up to date, we don't want to damage your credit file.  From here on,  you will have to budget. Take your weekly living expenses, and put that aside.  Keep a small amount of cash for incidentals.  From what is left, put half into your emergency fund, and half to your aunt.  It won't be easy, but after a while you will find that you can tough it out.  Good luck.|`|Ck88vVtQaa	talk with your aunt. dont want to burn the bridge. but you also need to build new ones.|`|1P3usILUaa	All three + a fourth actually and a fifth would be better.    1.2. & 3 (as above)  4.

There's no mention of income available here so not much more I can offer aside from above.

1NPImxZQaa	It is kind of bad etiquette to just get hired and start a job and then immediately ditch it for another.   However you are working at a fast food place and the turnover there is pretty high so they technically wont think anything of it.  If the new job is guaranteed, then let your current employers know. Give them the mandatory 2 week notice so just case in things dont work out, you are still on good terms with them.    If you are making a lateral move such as Burger King to McDonald's then I would say just stay at the job you're at. If you are making an upward move such as Burger King to the working at the mall or a hospital then definitely make the move.    If you are going to be making more or getting better insurance then definitely follow that. Whatever you decide, just don't no show for work. Let them know that you are leaving.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	which is the better opportunity.  Thats the one you need to take.|`|HUF5nZSuaa	You should do what makes you happy.

yaaNbLeyaa	I would think that, if your kids inherited a house, the will's executor or the lawyers handling probate of his estate would have contacted them regarding title transfer, etc.  Perhaps you can go through death and probate records in NJ to find out.  I would think you could do it online or you might have to hire an attorney to find out for you.  My gut feeling is that the uncle was "all talk" and your kids didn't inherit anything from him.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Why was he "supposed to" leave you anything?  Why are your daughter and son "entitled" to anything?|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	IF there was a will, someone would have had to file that will with the probate court in the jurisdiction where he lived.      You'll have to hire an attorney or a private investigator, to a.  find out if he died or not  b.  find out if a will was filed with probate and c.  find out what happened to the estate.     Keep in mind, any of his assets could NOT be inherited by ANYONE, until all of his debts were paid off.  If he had a lot of debts, or medical bills or what not, OR if he was getting Medicaid for health insurance, the house would have been sold to pay Medicaid back, or pay off the debts.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	I'm assuming your kids still have contact with their father. If they do I'm sure the father would have: a) informed them that their uncle has died and b) their uncle left them something. Even if they didn't the executor of the estate would have contacted you to inform you of the bequeathment.
2ApQCLroaa	Have a child and get like 2,000 for just eaned income credit. Have two children get more. Plus you get deductions for the child. But you have to take care of baby.|`|AA11284831	People get large refunds simply because they have too much money withheld from their pay or qualify for large refundable credits and don't take those into account properly when filling out Form W-4 at their jobs.  If you want an additional $2,500 in refund money tell your employer to withhold an extra $50 per week for tax.  Ba-da-bing!  $2,500 refund.  Good idea for you?  Only you can be the judge of that.    The goal is NOT to get a big refund at tax time but to come as close to breaking even as possible.  That way you put more money in YOUR pocket every payday as opposed to lending it to the government interest-free for upwards of 16 months.    Don't get suckered in by the advertising claims of big refunds.  Those claims push the limits of the law and are extremely misleading.  "Average" refund numbers are severely skewed by low-income taxpayers picking up large EIC payments and people who foolishly claim too few withholding allowances as a form of forced savings.|`|bzfXbM4raa	If you donate, you could use that, and get taxes back that way.|`|TxKzhbkzaa	There are a lot of different ways to increase your return.  To begin with, you can't get back more than you give them, so if you're taking 1 or 2 exemptions on either your state or federal withholdings from your paycheck, you will get less back.  I take 0 for both, which results in the highest amount being withheld, so I get a lot back.    As a student, you should technically get more, I think.  If you're paying on private loans, I think the interest you're paying is a deduction.  If you've started a retirement savings plan, you can get a credit for that due to your low income.  If you're over 25, you can look into the Earned Income tax credit.  If you own or rent your own place, you should be eligible for the Homestead credit.  Those are the things I'm looking at, but I bet there's more too.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I think everyone is suffering this tax time. I had 3,500 last year when my husband and I filed together. This year its 2,000 less....yeah 1,400 is a big drop.   Kids really skyrocket your tax refund. So does owning your own business, and donating to charities. If all you did was work, there is very little you can do unless you have someone dependent on you, be it a spouse, kid, or elderly/disabled family member.|`|vTstWTpvaa	To get that amount back, you need (possibly) a few things. Children give you addition tax credits (per each one, max of 2 credits). There is also EIC (earned income credit). EIC is a credit you get depending on quiet a number of things (if you have no children, you need to be at least 25 years old and if you are single, I believe the cap is around 12000something. A little higher if married... and you can't have but less than 2900 investment income).     Making more money doesn't always mean you will get more money back either. The more your make, the higher tax bracket you are placed into... and not only that, the less amount of low income credits you get. More is not always better at tax time.    Also, get married. Seriously. Married filing joint has the best standard deduction.        So for the most part.. the higher the return, more than likely, the people are married, have children, have low income, or a combination of all of that.    Keep in mind these are just major credits that are the most common. There are other credits you can look into. Also, if you have a lot of out of pocket expenses for work or charity or even personal stuff... you may want to consider itemization. If you can think of it, it most likely can be deducted.|`|ZzYDyCvtaa	There is no maximum amount that a person can earn or get back in a refund. Check your withholding. If you are claiming anything but single and zero allowances, you are probably going to get small refunds. The more money you make the higher tax rate you pay. In the past when you made very little, you probably got back all the taxes that were withheld. But now, you are getting taxed on part of your earnings. Claim single and zero at your new job. This will get you more back. You can also have them hold additional taxes out, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to do that. They would only give them back to you at tax time and it will earn no interest. It is also possible that you could get more of the stimulus payment since you only qualified for 300 of it last year.|`|KaY9ICZuaa	Get married, have children, buy a house, and oh yeah... don't make too much money so you get all the credits.

The best time frame you are looking at is around a week if you go through turbo tax and I don't think there are alot of people that would even say they trust that right about now. There are a lot of people that were supposed to get a refund on a certain day and now irs is saying otherwise. I wouldn't personally recommend anything like h&r just because they keep so much of your refund. I would say efile free file if you can and select the direct deposit option. Just a couple days more and you keep ALL your money. Good Luck|`|2V6gUBP4aa	I'm not quite sure that option exsits when doing yourself, but you can e-file your federal for free on the IRS website if you qualify. My fiance did it on Jan.16 and got his money direct deposited on Jan. 28.  Or you can go to H&R block and have them do them and apply for a refund anticipation loan.

AA12065007	What they have done is called a spot delivery this lets you have the vehicle while they seek someone to finance your loan.    They will call you back at some point and either resign you to a new contract or ask for more down payment or simply take you out of the vehicle.    Any down payment you may have made must be refunded they can charge you mileage but that's it.    Depending on how good your credit is many lenders do allow multiple vehicle accounts per person. So until you here back from the dealer don't worry.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	They allowed you to take the vehicle on "spot".  This basically means that you have the car in the hopes that they can find a bank.  Now if they don't find a bank, they won't come and get it.  However, they will require you to return the car.  Generally they will call you up on some "excuse" to get you back to the dealer.  Depending on how honest they are, they may wait until you are at the dealer and they have the car in their posession before they give you the bad news.  So if you get one of these calls you may want to have a plan to get yourself home as a backup.    If you placed any down payment you can expect that your down payment is gone.  Most of the time when they do this they have a clause that states if you have to return the car they will charge you a daily "rental" rate.  This amount usually wipes out any down-payment you may have put down.  If you put 0 down they very often won't come after you for any money, but they could.    Most lenders will not finance multiple vehicles per person, but they also are aware of accidents and do account for that.  But you should have more than "I hope that insurance will take care of it".|`|ZeAyk1graa	what they,ll do is find a lender but it will probably be one with real high interest,so you might be better off finding one your self that will pay the loan off to them,and then finance it for you,i don't think they will come and get it ,because of all the paper work ,but be careful of the lender they find you it maybe the highest interest rate allowed by law,good luck with it.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|UinOWcMUaa	easy as pie.. go around to neighbors, family or friends, and ask if you can help them at all with anything !!

Imagine the processing of hundreds of thousands of credits out to people.  These types of processes are done in batches.  Batches get moved around in dates for various reason, mostly to do with administrative processing and whether the review of one batch is done or not ~ and one may be done earlier or later than planned.    No worries

q7OJLm7Gaa	hi there!you can get answers to practically everything you need by going to zilosinformations.blogspot.com tell your friends its so hot.anyway here is an immediate answer to your question;  Employees today are ravenous for encouragement and positive feedback, but few feel they are receiving it. Here are the five top non-monetary rewards in the workplace that employees want:     1. Opportunity to Learn, Develop and Advance as an Employee.     Employees understand they need to grow, learn and develop new skills in order to advance. The ability to be able to choose their assignments and rise to new challenges offered by new responsibilities.     2. Flexible Hours.     Family, children, friends, church, sports, hobbies and other activities all have demands on today's employees. A flexible schedule or the occasional afternoon off can help employees meet some of these obligations. By allowing some flexibility in an employees schedule you can increase their desire and motivation. This, to some, is considered the most important of the non-monetary rewards in the workplace.         In today's high paced work environment it is reported that employees consider it very rare and infrequent that they receive recognition of their work and efforts. Think about it - What better way to have employees continue their good work and success then to offer them praise-verbal, written or ideally a public announcement? Recognition is probably the most sought after of the non-monetary rewards in the workplace.     4. The Opportunity to Contribute.     The opportunity to be part of the team. To work closely with managers and management. To be involved in key decisions. To be listened to and heard. 5. Independence and Autonomy.     Employees want to be able to work independently. They do not want someone constantly watching over them and questioning their every move. They like to receive their assignments -preferable with the time frame required for completion and then have the independence to complete the work given the guidelines and framework you have set on their own merits. This may not be seen as one of the more obvious non-monetary rewards in the workplace, but it is definitely an important one.       thats all i can give now my fingers are cramping.so next time just go to zilosinformations.blogspot.com leave the question as a comment,it will be answered!simple.           Once again share the good news|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Think of all the things that motivate people at work:    The promise of an extra day off.    The prize of coming in to work 1 hour later.    Getting lunch delivered to the employee at work.    The ability to lead a team at work as a reward.    Getting the best desk at the office.    Getting the best office at work.    Getting to dress casually for a day..

Actually there have been several questions recently on Y/A that are seriously calling into question these supposed 'reduce your debt programs'. I wouldn't trust them. All anyone needs to do is to stop charging things on their credit cards and make the payments on whatever amount they have already charged up.  ------------------------  LOL - the first thing that comes up on a search for 'resqdebt' on google is not the site - actually the number of hits is higher for 'resqdebt complaints' !

The US is being asked to lead the world out of a major bank failure. Almost a depression. But the country will be deeply in debt and that will be the President's legacy unless something dramatic occurs..

That is they will make the checks out to the other creditors and you so each of you will have to endorse them for them to be negotiable.  Tell the truth, it feels better and you won't have anything to worry about.  If you can't get a .loan for that purpose it will be a shame but not the end of the world.  You have a year to raise or save some money anyway.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	It's a civil matter and your application forms a contract with the lender. You have to sign a declaration that what you say is accurate.    If they find out you misrepresented the facts they can, in theory, cancel the loan and demand immediate repayment. In practice, as long as the repayments are made they are not going to worry.|`|K8LHoYruaa	If you aren't getting married for at least a year yet, then you are best trying to to pay as much as possible out of capital and earnings rather then getting a loan right now.     You probably have a wedding budget, which is great, but if you borrow it all now, and some expenses don't have to be paid for a year, you will lose money, as you will be charged interest for the loan.     Don't apply for loads of loans as the more you get turned down for, the worse your credit rating gets. Also do not lie in your application, as that, if found out, is fraud and could if pushed, be criminal.|`|p6o0LoY6aa	Its actually obtaining a credit transfer by deception|`|uSqisBIaaa	You don't need to tell a lie about the purpose of your loan.

Check out the link below to the IRS.    As for this year the bill that passed the house yesterday waiting to be passed by the senate does not contain a stimulus check.  It will lower the tax rates for taxpayers making under $150,000.  It could save single taxpayers $500 a year and married taxpayers $1000.

Never was seriously considered.|`|yGjNkae1aa	yeah so jog on|`|vTstWTpvaa	MAYBE.    The stimulus payment last year was actually a jump start for this year. When figuring your taxes, you will need to know how much you recieved for you stimulus. You can go to the irs.gov website and do a search for "Where's My Stimulus Check" and enter in your filing status for last year. It will tell you what you got.    If you did not get a stimulus OR, you didn't get your full amount last year (or are just intitled to more this year due to making more money perhaps) you will be sent the rest of it this year by the IRS. =)|`|ZzYDyCvtaa	In addition to l3rokken..'s answer, there is another bill on the horizon. The house passed it today but the senate has not yet. If it passes we could be getting another $500 per person, $1000 for couples. No mention yet about children or when this would be distributed.

muHctmaGaa	Dentistry would give you more autonomy and job security.    My mother is an RN, but at 51, she's constantly in fear of being laid off so nobody has to pay her retirement benefits. Older nurses are frequently let go for younger ones paid less. Also, I don't know if this is specific to the ER, but nurses are frequently "made examples of" even when it's clearly a patient's fault. There was a drug-seeker who came in to triage with a well-documented medical history of such behavior, whose doctors told the hospital to stop calling them about this particular man. The nurse took other patients in before his back pain complaint (as everything is based on need: car accident, chest pain, etc.) so he overdosed on Tylenol in the restroom just to be admitted. And the triage nurse was written up and suspended for failing to admit him in the first place. Is this fair? But hospitals have to do so much walking on eggshells as far as public perception goes. If you're considering nursing, you might as well be a doctor. Nurses do much of the same work as general physicians for far less pay and recognition.    From my personal experience with dentists, it looks like the hygenist does all the work, then the dentist just goes over it.|`|AYLRIMZJaa	My sister in law is a nurse (RN) and she loves it.  I will say this:  Nursing has been on the top jobs in demand lists for ever.  It never changes.  We will always need nurses.  I think that as a nurse you have so many more options in which to use your degree, so there is more job security.  Hospitals, doctor offices, schools, military, sporting events, etc.      School takes less time and if you chose to work in a hospital, your hours are great.  Most hospitals have shifts like 3 twelve hour days.  So you only work 3 days a week.  The have great benefits, and shift peremiums for afternoons and midnights.    Hope this helps.|`|F3Epxub5aa	nursing !!!  yuckk if yooh do dentistry yoohr have to deal with rotton teeth and bad breath e_e  but if yooh do turn out being onee ..  dont talk2 yoohr patients while yoohr sticking **** in there mouth =]|`|HlOjmGXRaa	Both are promising fields. However, teeth gross me out more than anything. So I would say nursing. I really is a matter of what you are more compassionate about.|`|AA11085566	Your question is vague as far as dentistry.  Dentist and M.D. are comparable.  Nurse and Dental Hygienist are comparable.  Ans Dental assistant Medical assistant are comparable.  Dentist are small business owners and have alot to deal with besides patient care.  Hygienists are just employees of the dentist and very little to deal with except patient care.  Dentists make $200K a year, if you are deciding on a dentist or nurse, and are willing to go the way I'd be the dentist.  If you are choosing between dental hygiene or nursing. I'm gonna have to go with Nurse.  It is a lifelong career, dental hygiene is not really.  Many options in nursing, NONE in dental hygiene.

Your rental agreement states YOU will pay the owner the rent every month.  I highly doubt you know all that is going on.

MYOB.|`|1e276cf277894bd2387532152b4db7a6aa	Yes, you have an agreement with the landlord and are obligated to it.  The arrangement or lease with the other tenants may be different.  If you are obligated to the contract (lease), then you need to abide by the terms.  If the other tenants are violating the terms of their lease, then its the landlords responsibility to enforce the terms of their agreement.  You really have no legal standing in this issue.

79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	To get people to go to your forum effectively, you have two options, spend time or spend money.    For gaining traffic to your forum without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or commenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independent website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that promotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your forum in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    As far as paid methods, look at pay per click as a great option. PPC is the process of advertising your business on a search engine within the sponsored results. You choose what keyword phrases you are willing to pay for being in, I.e. Website design.For cost effectiveness, consider narrowing your results as much as possible. For example, Sacramento website design instead of website design would be a more focused result and would by proxy cost much less than the broad term.    SIA Professional Services has an articles section in their website which has a ton of website marketing tips that should help you at www.siaservices.net just go to their blog or their articles section.    Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.    There is plenty more that you can do, but hopefully this give you a good starting point.    Good Luck and hope this helps|`|tVpRHvboaa	The top poster really gave most of what you can do.

However, in the real world,  whether it SHOULD matter or not is entirely irrelevant.  The workplace is usually a more conservative and mainstream place.  At the end of the day it doesn't matter who you are (dreadlocks or not).  When you turn up for an interview you will be judged by how you look.  Is it fair?  well, not always.  Does it happen, absolutely.  Bottom line is, if you want a job in a serious profession,  you will not only be judged by your credentials, you will also be judged by how you look.  First impressions count.  We all have to make adjustments to get the jobs we want.|`|B24W8w43aa	I think it's fine.

t9WYdqpiaa	Regrettably it will affect your borrowing capabilities despite the fact you paid the CCJ off fairly quickly.  Not all doom and gloom as some lenders will consider it . However please bear in mind in the UK at the moment there are only a couple of lenders who will consider 90% mortgages, and they will insist on a squeaky clean credit history. With the CCJ on your record you will probably need a minimum 20% deposit.  Best advice will be to speak to an Independent mortgage adviser, sooner rather than later, and take no notice of 'amateur' answers.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	I think you may have trouble as it'll show up on your file, but you dont know until you apply.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	As long as you can prove it's satisfied, your fine.

a20a4fa04465742160b7e256b054466aaa	I completely agree with you. My score used to be 810, I had a bad yr in 2005, i fell behind on bills due to my parents illness, I was taking care of them. I had to make a hard choice: keep a full time job and watch my parents die or help my parents and fall behind on payments. I have made my payments on time since then (its 2009!!), but my old mistakes still haunt me. I have not tried to get a loan since then. I live on cash, and even if I use one of my credit cards, i pay it off in full. I am not a deadbeat, i'm a college graduate, a professional, and lived in many countries but i feel like i am highly judged on my credit score. Not only that, it wont be off my report until 2012!!! I basically spent my whole twenties with bad credit score and basically blacklisted for a mistake i made for only 6 months in the 7 years! And if you noticed, once you have bad credit, these 3 bureaus try to keep you poor because no matter where you want an asset you have to pay more it includes: 1) if you need an apartment, most likely they will check your credit if you fail you dont get the apartment so you have to go live in a community who doesnt do credit check therefore you end up renting a ghetto place with less security 2) if you want a car, if ur score is not high enough, you either get a huge interest rate or get a lemon 3) if you want a house, you need a huge down payment to offset your bad credit score 4) even if you want a cell phone, if your score is not high enough then you pay a deposit.  So tell me if you are judged on your credit score to acquire assets, so basically you have to wait a long long time not be considered a deadbeat.|`|5BTKscZraa	I absolutely think that they have too much power and there needs to be stricter controls.  My main gripe is the accuracy of the info they report and the validation process. The big 3 are about profits first...the accuracy of what they report comes at  a distant second.  Many bottom feeder debt collection agencies caught on to this a long time ago and are using this as a sort of extortion racket...holding your credit rating hostage to pay ancient debts.     In your case, you won't  have bad credit the entire 7 years...after 2 years the effects should start to wear off.

Would be good to let them know though what you are up against, and that the lack of bonus doesn't mean that you don't value them, just that you didn't have extra money and needed what you had to keep the business going so they'd all have jobs.

ybbte4snaa	There is actually a law which requires are loan company to disclose to all clients any costs, fees and other charges in connection with a loan application.    This is the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) of 1968 which is a United States federal law.  It is designed to protect consumers in credit transactions, by requiring clear disclosure of key terms of the lending arrangement and all costs. The statute is contained in Title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act.    The purpose of TILA is to promote the informed use of consumer credit, by requiring disclosures about its terms, cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a lien on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit card practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	If they have a valid judgment they can attach your bank account.  So you have to consider that account "dead".  Any money you put into it from now on will be attached until the debt is paid.  You need to immediately open up another account at another bank, do not use the same bank as that makes it real easy for them to find it.  The creditor will eventually find your new account and you will probably have to do this again.    Honestly, Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a last resort but it is sometimes the best choice.  The big question is if you have other debts other than this one.  If this is your only debt and only for about 5K, then BK may not be the way to go.  You should consult an attorney who deals in bankruptcy to see what your options are.  Most will give you a free short consultation.

7b3dc095af2c9c3b83bd94878260ec2baa	This would need a state-specific answer.  Generally, the answer is yes that you could qualify for subsidized housing if on unemployment as long as your income falls below the income limit. Here you can look up the income limits for your city by family size:  http://www.huduser.org/datasets/il/il200...  Keep in mind that all your assets are considered as part of your income like bank interest, stocks, annuities, rental property, real estate, you get the idea. The one problem I see is that unemployment will run out and you have to have income in order to stay in subsidized housing.  I recommend finding out how much you would get on unemployment then call the agency that handles the subsidized housing and then perhaps they can give you an idea of the rent cost.  There's a lot of paperwork involved.  Also, Medicaid is not that easy to get.  Some people make only $300 a month and that's why there's a need for subsidized housing. Be grateful you are healthy, have a great-paying job, can pay your rent and are not restricted by the regulations of subsidized housing.  It's not greener on the other side of the block
M3maZgdyaa	It sounds like they will enter your apartment uninvited and that illegal for a landlord to do. Check with the rental association in your area and they will give you up too date information on the laws concerning the raise in your deposit. I have never heard of a deposit being raised just the rent.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	These all seem very reasonable.  In most jurisdictions, the security deposit is a month's rent so if the rent increases, the security deposit also increases.  I have had to pay extra whenever the rent has increased.  They are just making sure that everyone is current.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I have always wondered about upping the security deposit each year with the new lease is signed, so far they have not asked. But my building it not for sale. I was in one that was sold and the sale did not affect us at all.  Call housing and see what is legal. The Repairs for damage, thats the one that concerns me. Lets say someone broke a door and the bldg fixed it, I guess she has let someone go without paying and told them they would take it at the end. If thier trying to recoup money not owed them, thats another thing. It does state though within thirty days of notification. Number two also states when notified. I would ask the mgr now, why is the company selling taking money from you, and ask if a new lease and what kind of lease will now be issued do to this change to the poilicy that was at hand when you moved in. Call housing, go to housing find whats legal. So they will be doing an inspection she kinda forgot to mention, she says give to her or leave in your apartment. Sorry what a bummer. It could be worse in our area, people who own rental houses go bankrupt and they tenants of the home get short notice to move, and the landlords have no funds to return to the renters. Some are renting for one month and being told to get out.|`|ZnywY78Daa	Ive never heard of that, I wouldnt pay them extra money for the security deposit, I would wait until the new landlord comes in and pay them. What ever you end up doing pay by check and make sure you get a receipt for documentation.|`|C6WloQoaaa	I think the legitimacy of her agenda lies in the lease you signed.  if you signed a year long lease, and you still have 4 months remaining, you don't owe any extra money (unless it's somehow written in the lease).  Let her take you to court and if the lease is on your side, the judge will laugh at her.    If your lease renews month to month and doesn't mention anything about security deposit inflation, then you don't owe extra.  However, the landlord could get you in a new lease at the beginning of next month that will have you owe extra, if you sign it.    As far as repairs to damage that was inflicted during the time you lived in the residence, the lease most definetely holds you and your roommates accountable for the fixit costs.  that's pretty standard.  If I were you, I'd have her deduct it from the security deposit instead of forking over extra money and hoping she'll return your full deposit when you move out.    unless you really like the place, you and your roommates should move out, just to spite her.  she doesnt seem like a very cool landlord.|`|806455f30adefbff1e3b1fbdc3ecc722aa	In today's Real Estate world, this appears to be easy to explain. Your present landlord is likely looking to pocket this money.     I would very clearly write directly on the check "per letter dated xx/xx/xxxx and subject to criminal prosecution if used for any other purpose."     The only reason to sell in today's market is distress. Your present landlord is hurting for money. I guaranty you that you will be charged again when you move out for all damages and that the new deposit fees are not transferring with the property. Any escrow money will have been taken into account already. The present owner is looking to steal your money. I'd go ahead and pay it, per the writing on the check, just to be able to get his butt thrown in jail for stealing!|`|kMpgMplmaa	no i'm not a rocket scientist but i dont think they can do that.

I think it's funny that millions of people will just blurt out - PAYDAY LOANS ARE A SCAM !!!!!!!  when in reality they can be a help if they are used as intended. If people would pay it cback in time they will not get any extra fees and the loan will help them out.  I got one last month and it was a big help.   My brother also got one and couldn't pay it back on time. so he got extra fees and fell into a awful debt cycle.   Also I recommend just getting a $300 loan cause if you borrow more money you'll have to pay way more interest. the website I went to was Spotya.com  http://www.spotya.com    they were the lowest rates i could find after doing research. I borrowed $300 and paid back $340.

79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	To get people to go to your website effectively, you have two options, spend time or spend money.    For gaining traffic to your website without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or commenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independent website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that promotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your forum in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    As far as paid methods, look at pay per click as a great option. PPC is the process of advertising your business on a search engine within the sponsored results. You choose what keyword phrases you are willing to pay for being in, I.e. Website design.For cost effectiveness, consider narrowing your results as much as possible. For example, Sacramento website design instead of website design would be a more focused result and would by proxy cost much less than the broad term.    SIA Professional Services has an articles section in their website which has a ton of website marketing tips that should help you at www.siaservices.net just go to their blog or their articles section.    Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.    There is plenty more that you can do, but hopefully this give you a good starting point.    Good Luck and hope this helps|`|Z8oZGwE3aa	Some of the ways you can advertise your business are:  1. Post an article about your business on related blogs and get free visitors and back links  2. Submitting to directories  3. Free classifieds  4. Forums    Send an email with more information about your business to e@culx.net for free help on finding new customers and increasing sales.|`|f9fsR60Gaa	If we are to look from purely from a channel perspective, there are many options. In practise I have routinely found that a fully integrated emarketing campaign that spans website optimization and SEO while also targeting businesses with a (short term) email blast and PPC campaign would be of most benefit. This would enhance both your natural traffic to the website and could also generate new leads for your business.    Your website is always the key to your success and as they say, content is king. If you get this correct, and believe me enough people overlook this basic necessity, you will have all the material you need to go to market and promote your qualities through various channels. I routinely hear the overly coined phrase "thought leadership", but it is true. You have to portray yourself as the specialist. Its why theyre going to listen to your marketing instead of someone else. So thought provoking material, whether that be white papers, case studies, blogs, video, podcasts are a must. Giving prospects as much free information and insight into your world will lead them to think just one thing. These guys are good - I want to work with them. So find, write or sponsor content that is well referenced, relevant and topical to keep people coming back to your website. This is what search engines feed on. Good quality content that will also keep their customers satisfied.     You need to promote your consultants human side so referencing them and providing details is a big factor. Some companies may go as far as using social networking sites (twitter for example) to communicate the projects and daily successes of the people involved. Personally I'm yet to be convinced total by its rewards but it is worth testing for impact, especially in a consultation company that needs customer focus.    Now, once your content is sourced its back to website optimizing. The way your site is built determines how well it is referenced by the search engines. To do this properly you need a good web designer to go into the code and get critical. Poor site architecture is a killer but you've got to know what to look out for. Do not use the company who built it.     A few simple area's that they will cover after the site is rebuilt are checking submissions to search engine, meta data testing, inbound link quality, site maps and making sure your content is key word rich. Good testing can take up to a month. If it is well planned and thoughtout it will give you the ROI you deserve.    To be professional you must also consider your online brand and test the complete website with people who are unfamiliar to your company. What are there perceptions of the company from your website?    As you can tell I could go on for hours so hope this snippet has been helpful and given a taste of how to get started.    Regards
01f5341d0d029dbc96f058ba056b39abaa	Hi -  I would write something like this:    The Medical Receptionist/Clerical Assistant position really has my interest.  I believe I would be a good match for this position having experience in customer support and Frontline receptionist.  I would like making a positive difference in the Medical Center/Hospital with my professional appearance and punctuality.  I enjoy meeting new people, so would look forward to greeting the patients as they arrive for appointments.  I like the Clerical Assistant aspect of the job because it would give me the opportunity to use my secretarial and organizational skills.  This job would no doubt require multitasking of which I love the challenge of having more than one thing going on at a time.    May I have an interview with you this week?  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

If it is separately shown in the Bill for some of the obvious reasons, the total Gross value of the Bill does not cross the actual payable amount as per PO Terms and conditions. You can directly credit the supplier and debit the supplier at the time of making the payment to the Supplier.    Illustration:  Amount payable as per PO Gross  Rs 1,00,000/    If the supplier raises Bill as follows:  Basic value of the Goods                  80,000/  Cex. duty                                         8,000/  CST                                                 2,000/    Freight prepaid                                10,000/  the Journal Entry is as follows:    Goods A/c ( Hard ware stores)   Dr   92,000  Cex. input credit A/c                 Dr     8,000/     To Supplier A/c                                                1,00,000/    If there is no Central Excise in put credit facility, it is to be included in the Goods Cost.    while making the payment, debit Supplier A/c. with 1,00,000/ and pay.

It will help in that if you have less credit available to you, that is a good thing.  However, it could help you to keep the current limits because the ratio will be going down.  Which will have the more powerful effect?  I do not know.

I mention that because if you want to position yourself as semi-pro at this, you should be aware of that.

Auto refresh allows you to show 60 ads if the browser is open 60 minutes, which means 60 pageviews for you    But banner ad networks -- from Adsense to BurstMedia -- disallow auto refresh because it is basically cheating, telling the advertisers the ad was viewed several times when it was only really seen 1 time.

WYjbuu6saa	No.    A Paralegal could be a company's Secretary.    But a company's Secretary isn't necessarily a Paralegal.    Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST in the USA!!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in if you are coming to the USA!!  Many reasons.  Main reason?....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Legal Profesionals here in the USA.  ("Legal Professionals" includes, but is not limited to:  Attorneys/Lawyers, Paralegals, Legal Assistants, Legal Secretaries, Bailiffs, Court Reporters, etc, etc)    The schools know this, but they will not tell you.  Graduates in the field of Law are easy money for the schools, because they do not have to make a great investment in them.  The schools will not tell you that the economy is SATURATED with Legal Professionals - we have a GLUT.    If you are going to come to the USA, consider the field of Healthcare!     Good luck.|`|1F28QvFCaa	Not necessarily similar - a paralegal may be required to work in several different areas of law e.g. litigation, conveyancing, whereas a company secretary is usually responsible for ensuring that a company fulfills its legal requirements regarding registration of share dealings etc. Your CS course in India may be of use but company law in the US is quite different from that in commonwealth countries so you might well have to take a further course to work in this field in the US>

My first inclination is to say S*d it - You only get married once in a blue moon and dont let the circumstances spoil it one little bit for you both.  He would be expected not only to register for JSA quite an involved process in itself (and all rather depressing) but you may be eligible for some help with Rent/Mortgage - Community Charge etc all of which takes time gathering the required forms together submitting them to the required Office - chasing them up. They would want to see Redundancy letters - redundancy entitlements if any - Bank statements for the last 3 Months to prove you havn't got Savings of over 16000 a veritable mountain of paperwork - The very last thing you need before leaving for Kenya.    I'll stick with my first inclination ( register by all means) - And then GO - Go - GO and I know it sounds daft but try and put it all to the back of your mind for 3 weeks (nothing is going to spoil in the meantime - or improve for that matter).

In that time I would perhaps sit down together and write out your finances (outgoings each month, the savings you have, etc) that way you can see where you could pull your belts in and what kind of money you will need to be earning over each month. Write out a few job ideas and a strategy so that you have a plan to follow when you come home, is there any friends/family members you can call on that might have job oppotunities to offer (now is a time to call in favors!).

mmMgfhf2aa	If the policy is to protect your mortgage (in the event of your death or critical illness) the interested party (mortgage lender) will be noted on the policy anyway. They won't need to ask this. If your claim is due to your ill health then they will ask your doctor for confirmation. It's hard to say without knowing what kind of policy and what claim you're making. Don't worry though, if you have trouble talking through things on the phone, ask them to put everything they need in writing so you can complete their forms and supply everything they need at your leisure without feeling pressured.
AA12252493	There is no "legal" license to sell wholesale.  Anyone can sell to anyone else for resale.  The only issue is sales tax.   Anyone operating a business to sell goods or services needs to register in their state with the tax department, collect sales/user taxes, fill out periodic tax returns and send the collected taxes to the state.  Wholesale buyers who are buying goods for resale do not need to pay sales taxes to you,  but must supply you with a resale number and certificate.  You still have to report the sales, but on the state form, you can deduct them from the sales on which taxes are due.        Similarly, if you wish to buy "wholesale" and no pay sales taxes,  you have to obtain a sales tax number and registration and provide the seller with a resale certificate.  For out of state or out of country transactions,  this is usually not an issue,  but their are exceptions.   Step one is to register with your state  Misuse of this process is fraud and carries very heavy civil and perhaps criminal penalties.    department of revenue,  so don't try to skip the steps.   If your state/city has no sales tax,  there's no problem..... let me know where you live, I'm moving there!

AqVKFaaGaa	Well, sorry to say it, but if he's not registered at any address, they will go to where his mail is - so your place. By not being registered wherever he actually lives, he is putting you and your future child at risk, so you have to be strong and get him to sort things out NOW...  Don't bother lying about knowing him if you get all his mail.    He must register at the address he really lives at, and get all his mail to go there (nothing at all should come to your place until it's all sorted) - if he doesn't no one is ever going to believe he doesn't live with you and that your stuff isn't actually his. He then must contact the creditors who sent the bailiffs and inform them of his address and that he has no financial link with you, so they cannot legally take your stuff.  You also need him to remove all his belongings from your address by the way, everything down to his toothbrush.    To be very blunt, if he refuses to do that, and face up to his debts, I doubt you have much of a future with him - if he loves you and wants the best for you and your baby, he will sort things out and keep you safe.    Tell him to get some help to manage his debt and sort things out - he should be able to stop the bailiffs altogether if he arranges a payment plan with his creditors and sticks to it (in the UK, the CAB can help him sort things out). If his debts are above a manageable level, he may have to go bankrupt, hard call, but that will keep you and the baby out of trouble.    Whatever you do, do not get any financial link with him - no joint account, do not take any loan for him, don't accept to be guarantor for him, nothing at all or your possessions will be at risk too.    Good luck with the pregnancy, and act fast so you can just relax and think only of you and the baby.|`|6xiwiiIzaa	Tell the Bailiffs and your Boyfriend Its not your Debt,and they cant take any of your property only hes , take the worry to hes door and think of yourself and your baby,|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Are you sure they are bailiffs?  Bailiffs are court officials and would have told you so and shown you ID.  It sounds more like debt collectors, they have no power to seize goods but your partner does need to address this ASAP.|`|C3sqTngtaa	when hes not at yours where does he live then? he gotta be registered somewhere chick! put ya footdown and tell her to sling it|`|XS0ltAYaaa	If his payslips come to your address then simply tell the Bailiffs that your home is merely a postal address for your boyfriend. They can not legally take anything from your home as they belong to you. Possession is nine tenths of the law. If they do take anything from your home then you can call the police & have them arrested for threatening behaviour & theft, as your boy friend is not registered as living at your address.   Perhaps you should consider ending this relationship you have, as your boyfriend does not sound as if he is a responsible person. If he is not responsible enough to pay his debts, then he is not responsible enough to be a parent.   You do not need this stress in your life, its not healthy for you, nor is it healthy for your unborn child. You both deserve better.  Good Luck. X :-)|`|ARAYm7BLaa	Actually sweetheart, he is registered at your address, he's just not on the tenancy agreement ....Just tell the bailliffs that the debts are solely his and do not let him store stuff at your address...he shouldn't be putting you through all this in your condition and perhaps you should ditch him.Make sure that you dont let the baillifs in as they will make a list of what they're going to take and then come back for it later...also, dont leave any windows or doors open even when you are in as they can legally climb in...so you're in for a sealed up Summer I'm afraid. You should really get him to sort these debts out before the stress really gets to you.

2qVzfmsgaa	Hello,    It's a ripoff, a scam which targets people who don't know enough about Google AdWords and AdSense. Please, do not give them your credit card info, they will charge you $1 now, then later on will charge you more and there's nothing which can save your money.    Please, use your money for better things. If you want to earn money, not fast though, sign up to AdSense, start a blog and write about something you have knowledge about: cooking, cats, health care, acne, anything. You'll be amazed how many people will come to read and click your ads. In the same time you can also use AdWords to promote your blog. On the content network it's very cheap.    To learn more about AdSense and AdWords search the Google Help pages.|`|lEXTHOZPaa	Never opt for jobs which require you to pay a fee, which may be unreliable.

All you do is sign up for offers by entering your e-mail adress and click accept and then once the offer is approved the money goes into your account .. it ranges from 50 cents to 2$.. you can get paid by check, or by pay pal. Its called treasure troopers, and in addition you get to play minigames after each offer to find a gem which adds up and u can trade them for gift cards and other items used to participate on the site... heres the link if your interested.

I have always come to the conclusion its a game of numbers and networks that takes a lot of time and effort to set up.    Most surveys are a scam or low paid with payout figures you cant reach.    Data Entry can be legit but you need to get word of mouth referal.    I now make a truckload of money online with a thousanth of the work I used to doing adsense and adwords.    It all revolves around clickbank, affiliates ( be warned lots are bodgy)  and marketing my products at absoltely no cost.
PxoKseAiaa	Why on earth do you want to put your name on a mortgage for a *friend*?  What happens, if, in 7 mos he cannot get a mortgage on his own?  You are going to be stuck with this albatross around your neck for 30 years possibly.  Rethink this.  Never buy property with a *friend*.  Also, if you get a mortgage, yes, it takes away your ability to use your first time buyers credit.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	You are STRONGLY advised against allowing your friend to 'use your name' to obtain a loan.  This is a recipe for a disaster in the future.  If your friend cannot get a loan NOW, he won't get one in seven months either, and you will be tied to that mortgage until he DOES get his own loan (if he EVER gets one).    Furthermore, if he fails to make those payments as agreed, it is YOUR credit which is trashed, along with his, unless YOU make the payments instead.|`|swL7bQfAaa	If your name appears on a document to say you bought a house - you bought a house, whether for yourself or somebody else. You are therefore NOT a first home owner according to the grant terminology.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	For your friends house?  Yes, you are legally the owner.    2 items of caution though...    First, the credit is not free money.  It is a loan and will have to be paid back.    Second, what you are describing is a straw buyer and it is illegal.  If found out, YOU are the one in trouble for fraud, not him.  Think very carefully before doing this.  If he can't get the loan in his name now, he is not going to be able to get the loan in his name in 7 months.
2OO9U8o9aa	Go to your local college and ask what courses the run connected to your interests . Also you should contact relevant universities about the degree you are talking about and ask what is the minimum achievements ( A level O level etc) that are needed .   From what I have read and seen in media etc there are many courses which would appear to be suitable to hold your interest   As for a job , well put that on the back burner till you have found which courses you are going to do and in any case at university you will be advised of companies seeking to fill vacancies and graduate training   So take one step at a time , forget about the millions for now and just concentrate of what you do first|`|qcLRjTPTaa	work your way up as an architec

The sort of jobs that I can think of that can ne suitable for your level of skill without going into an apprenteship are like: shop assistant, runner, factory worker, cleaner, MLM, data entry, office clerk.    These jobs are all over the place in job agencies and local newspapers. Although I can't say I would be too thrilled about them.

Look into it at http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk/|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Well the first thing to say is stick at it and even if it means taking a job that is not perfect you should try it out as often it is easier to find another job if you are already employed . It is not easy at any time to get a job , even more so at the moment , so that makes you CV and accompanying letter even more important . It needs to stick out from all the others so that you get to the first stage of interview . Assuming you get that then you really have a chance to impress . So you arrive in good time , dress smartly and be prepared by knowing a bit about the company and have some questions to ask (not salary !!)   As for further education , there are schemes supported by government which means you will get courses free of charge . Get yourself down to local college and ask for lists of what courses they run in the evening and how you go about getting the relevant finance   I wish you luck

LeNeinDUaa	I recommend talking honestly with the landlord. Legally he is not obligated to do anything. HOWEVER, he most likely will realize if you dont have a job you wont be able to pay him rent, so it is in both your benefits to cancel. Request he reimburses you what you already paid to agree to cancel the lease on your end. The eviction process is such a headache for landlords most likely he will agree to find new tenants that will pay him :)|`|ikXRqWxUaa	unless the lease had some kind of provision for lay-offs, than no, you would not be able to get out of it.  think of it from the landlord's point of view.  if you move out, they have to not only get another renter in there, but they are out of pocket for the lost money until the place is occupied again.      my advice to you would be to talk to the landlord.  if you appeal to his/her judgement, perhaps you can both come to an agreement that will be best for all.  can you get someone else that is qualified in the place?  can you foot the bill to advertise the place?      make sure that you comply with the lease and avoid the temptation to just up and leave.  you could find yourself completely out of pocket for the entire deposit or in court.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Mostly likely not, unless the landlord is understanding about your sudden change in income.  You may be able to break it, but will lose all that money you just handed over to them to move in.  Hope you find work soon :0)|`|4UBxVIYFaa	No.  Your situation does not invalidate your lease, as unfortunate as the timing appears to be.  You can only speak to the landlord, explaining what has occurred.  Perhaps there will be some forgiveness on his part, and he may allow you out of the lease with minimal penalty.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Not unless: (1) there was a provision in your lease permitting the cancellation in the event of a layoff, or (2) your landlord agrees to terminate the lease.
