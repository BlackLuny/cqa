20090222174951AA1U9pb	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	19 year old from California thinking about going to film school in Colorado, couples questions about loans etc?	Ok so my buddy and I are both 19/20 years old and basically on our own. We are tired of our regular old jobs and tired of always talking about getting into the movie industry but never doing anything about it. So, we decided we should just put ourselves out there and give it a go. We are liking the Colorado film school idea BUT here is where my questions begin. First of all we have pretty much no money, so what should we be doing to try to get loans that will pay for our schooling and housing (there are no school housing, just apartments near by that are really cheap). Lol I know this is stupid but in reality I know it can help but he is an independent black dude and I would be an independent Mexican dude, should we be flaunting this like some have told me? Secondly, are there any citizenship factors I should know about as in switching from CA to CO? I guess the best way of putting this all into ONE general question, is are the basic steps the both of us should be following to get us a place in Colorado and into school? And I have to emphasize that we basically have no money, he is on food stamps, I live rent free with my parents but pay for everything else on my own. I was hoping to be able to start the school process in at least a year... IDK if thats a realistic figure or not, but yeah, just anything you can tell me to help me gain some bit of knowledge would be much appreciated, thanks!

I've always had the plan of first getting my Bachelor's degree here and then going to another country to see how my major (Early childhood development) is used/implemented/thought of/ etc in a different country. I so very badly want to go to England first. The only issue is that I can't for the life of me find any of my old resources on how exactly to do it. I understand that it will be hard, and more expensive, but honestly, I grew up in California where it is super expensive to live in a Studio apartment. I understand that London especially is more expensive. I just am wondering if anyone has any links, or places I can contact to see this dream through. I still have another year until I'm finish with school here so I'd have plenty of time to research it and think it through before I did anything. So please, if you have any kind of help links, resources, places to write/email, call, etc, help me out and I'd be most grateful. Thank you.

Thank You!      DNGRS OF TXT MSGS    In 2006, 158 billion text messages were sent nationwide as stated by CTIA, the wireless association. Seventeen Magazine 1,000 sixteen and seventeen year olds and reported that 46% percent of them admit to text messaging while driving, and 51% admit to talking on their cell phone while driving. PRNewswire.com claims that “Recent teen driving tragedies involving text messaging while driving are evidence that driving distractions are becoming as prevalent as drinking and driving.” According to a national survey of more than 900 teens with driver’s licenses from 26 national high schools, 37% of teens rated text messaging “extremely” or “very” distracting while driving; others most likely are not admitting that it is a distraction.     Teens claim that they “text-to-death”, but do they realize they are literally text messaging to their death? There is no statistic on how many deaths per year there are from text messaging distractions and 63% of teens do not admit that text messaging distracts them. A lot of teens have acquired the skill to text message without looking, which is not as harmful as long as they keep their eyes on the road.     Rob Callender, trends director for Teenage Research Unlimited, stated, “It’s a form of silent communication; they can do it whenever, they can do it fairly secretively.” He added, in a recent study (May 20, 2007) TRU found text messaging the second most popular use for cell phones next to using them to check the time. Teens like to text message because it is secretive, parents cannot hear it, teachers cannot hear it and the messages sent are not shown up on bills.     According to dailycommercial.com, Emilee Cox, a fourteen year old freshman holds the record for 35,463 text messages in one month. If young teens are text messaging that much it can only mean trouble for the future. If teens are not thinking clearly, they are bound to get on the road and text message, which will not be good for everyone else on the road.     While some states are still allowing drivers of all ages use their cell phone while driving, other states have banned it. “California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Washington are the only states that have bans on all drivers using hand-held phones.”, according to an article in Land Line Magazine. It goes on to say “With the exception of New York, each of these also prohibits text messaging. Alaska, Louisiana and Minnesota have their own text messaging bans. In addition the articles mentions, “17 states forbid young drivers to use phones while behind the wheel.”, although not mentioning which specific “17 states” forbid it.     Driving behavior is not always a teen’s fault alone, they learn from their parents. 62% of teens admit that their parents talk on their cell phone while driving, 48% say their parents speed and 31% say their parents do not wear a seat belt (PRNewswire.com). Driving is a habit picked up just like any other habit. Parents are role models for their children and should try and set a better example while driving. Stricter consequences for their children to not use cell phones while driving should also be set. Although most teens have enough common sense to set their own rules and guidelines for driving, their parents should be the ones setting a prime example and enforcing strict rules with consequences following if the rules are broken.     William Van Tassel, PhD, manager of AAA Driver Training states, “Motor vehicle crashes are the number one killer of teens claiming more than 6,000 fifteen to twenty year-olds each year. Inexperience behind the wheel coupled with poor decision making construct additional reasons for teens to stay focused while they are driving. Their attention should not be divided among phones, friends and the road.” (RISMedia).     Text messaging is becoming a popular pastime and a dangerous one at that; many teens are driving around daily text messaging at the wheel and it is not safe. The statistics show that plenty of teens do it and that it is clearly an un-safe distraction. If bills to ban phone usage on the road are passed by more states, research shows the road will be a safer place.

20090222231558AALVCYz	Education & Reference;Special Education	MMA or Special forces?	I have heard alot of debate over who would win a fight. MMA or Special forces ?      The way I see it. In a ring, MMA would most likely be the victor. On the street or in the jungle, special forces would come out on top.     Usually though it depends on the situation and what factors come into play. I can't say who would win for sure. I'm just giving the most likely outcome.     MMA are thought to fight and are in great shape. Special forces are thought to kill and are in great shape.     I've seen a 75 year old WWII vet take out a 18 year old black belt in Kung fu.     I have also seen a vietnam vet take out a BJJ Black Belt. These situations were not in the ring. They were on the street.     If these had been i a ring. I'm sure the vets would have lost. Or if any number of factors had been differant the vets could have lost.     I hope this clears up some arguments.

I work for a private attorney who recently left his firm when i begin to work for him. Because of this he never had to worry about paying secretarys and such so i was his first. The first year he took out the proper taxes from my check but didn't set up seperate accounts like he was suppose to per the government so to avoid penaltys he just wrote me a check for all my withholdings and didn't claim me, therefore i didn't file for taxes. The second year, pretty much the same thing happened, he tried to do it right but to no avail so again, i wasnt given a w2 or any other forms to file my taxes. He's on the right track this year because he has hired an accounting firm to do his payroll. But due to the mistakes made the prior 2years i have ran into trouble applying for financial aid (especially fasfa) because i have not done taxes in two years and now i won't be able to start school until May when i file this years taxes.

20071104153653AA9yjK4	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please tell me what you think of my classification essay for english composition look for pt 2?	Three Types of Teachers   By: Sarah Wilson   English Composition    11/05/07   No matter where you go, you will always be surrounded by teachers. Sometimes the teachers can come in the form of parents, grandparents, or even siblings. Mostly, when people think of teachers, they think of the teachers at public schools.  You will always encounter some type of these teachers in your learning experiences. In my experience throughout school years, I can classify my different teachers into three types: enjoyable, boring, and mean.       Enjoyable teachers are the ones who will be your favorite teachers. Though they do stand up and lecture in front of you, they don’t do it the whole time. They involve you by letting you learn through fun activities such as groups or learning games. One recent teacher I have is an example. While he is doing the lecture, he will try to cite examples of what he talking about by asking us if we have experienced something like it. He will also put us into groups where we

20090203132407AAdYKxP	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I'm a math major, but I am seriously thinking about changing my major?	I'm a sophomore math major and I want to change my major.  I'm taking the first theoretical math course, Intro to Advanced Mathematics, and doing proofs bores me to death!  I liked the calculus courses and I'm liking differential equations this semester, so now I plan to minor in math and take electives in applied math and stats, since those are the fields in math I'm interested in.      I come to the conclusion that I will not enjoy the upper level math courses (Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, Analysis), so I'm planning on changing my major to psychology or economics.  With a math minor focusing on applied math and stats, will choosing one of the two over the other make a difference?  I'm more interested in psych, but I know that econ is marketable.  Can I still be marketable with a math minor?

20090203134723AAFTS9c	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Which student loan should I choose? Perkins or Stafford?	I am thinking about going back to school to earn my associates degree in business management since my employer offers tuition reimbursment. Since the economy is still in the hole, even attending the local community college would put me in the hole financially if I had to pay for my education up front since reimbursement is only applied at the end of the class when final grades are issued. So I am considering a student loan to help pay for my education and then as the courses and grades are completed, apply the reimbursement funds to the repayment of the loan. It sounds brillant but now I am confused as to which student loan would work best in this situation. I know I have to apply for the FAFSA and that will determine which I qualify for, but if I qualify for both, which is better? I don't want to have to pay for any of it if my employer's tuition reimbursement covers it- but unfortunately they do not cover interest. Please only respond if you are truly knowledgeable about both types of loans or have been in a similar situation. Thanks!
