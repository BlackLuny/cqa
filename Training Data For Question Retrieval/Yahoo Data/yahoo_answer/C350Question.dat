20090128183311AAiLmnA	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Horoscope Question..?	My girlfriend sent me her horoscope today and I was wondering if someone knew where I could find this.  I looked all over but every site I found didn't have this.     "Mars will bring drama your way this month.  You will meet a new guy and instantly like him.  The catch?  You are already dating someone.  Jupitar helps you post through your feelings on february 17th, so you will be confident you are making the right choice."   I never believed in these things but this has got me a little concerned.  If I ask her about it she'll think I don't trust her.  So any help of the website she found it on or any general info on horoscopes would really be a help.  Thanks.

They where singing "a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down" and the lady was giving the guy a spoon full of sugar and he was really fat.   That's the best i can describe. So do you know what it was called?

20090128183803AAOcNiA	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Is music overrated and overhyped?	i've never understood people who say that 'music is their life'. people who are listening to their ipod all the time and who remember the words to hundreds of songs. yet this seems to be a lot of people! i'm at university and i notice it everyday... it annoys me because when me and my flatmates get together in an evening and drink beers in my friend's room, the only activity we do is trawl through my friend's extensive music collection on his laptop and proceed to listen and 'sing along'... particularly annoying as i haven't listened to these songs three-hundred times before to learn the words.. so i end up sitting there just looking around... lol i don't own an mp3 player.    don't get me wrong i like and appreciate music... i think it's only human to like it. however i think it's importance in everyday life has been blown out of proportion, especially in the second half of the 20th century when tapes and cassettes became available. it became a teenage sign of rebellion against parents, and i think it still is but it's spiralled uncontrollably and now music, bands etc. seem to be the centre of everything and it's almost like a popularity thing... the more bands you know or songs you can recite make you more popular. i can't imagine music being so intrinsic in the everyday lives of people - especially young people, who lived in the 19th century and before. what do you think?

20090128193128AALqjk7	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Yay! my 2ed Anime poll...anyway...?	Ok. heres a death note poll. srry, its alittle long.      Question 1: How do you feel about Light's motifs in the anime?     Amused, it's pretty interesting to see what he comes up with next!      That he is justice, and his actions are morally correct.      Although I think his motifs are bad, I almost feel I favour them.      Bitter, he is taking a foolish attitude towards life, and has bad motifs.      Good, I agree with him cleansing the world.      Question 2: You find a Death Note and read the rules. You become aware that the notebook works. How do you feel?     Crept out, that's a scary amount of power to be held within a notebook...      Curious, I'd like to find out as much as possible.      Anxious, you know I think some people deserve to be punished.      Pretty reserved, not too bothered.      Great, think of all the things I could do with it.      Question 3: You find yourself in a very tight situation with the Death Note, and are faced with the dilemma of making the Shinigami eyes deal. Which of these would best describe your feelings?     If it has to be done, I guess I'd just go for it. Besides, the eyes could be very useful.      I'd give it some serious consideration, but I don't really think I'd go for it unless it was extremely important and I was very confident of my decision.      It's very tempting to get myself out of this extreme problem, but I don't think I'd go through with it. Perhaps if it were to protect others...      There's no way I'd give up half my lifespan, there's got to be another way around the problem, no matter how tough it is.      Why would I need to make the deal anyway?      Question 4: What sort of people would you want to kill with a Death Note?     Those who stand in my way.      I wouldnt want to have to kill anyone with it!      Anyone, really.      Evil people.      People who heavily break the law and act with injustice.      Question 5: Are you currently in a relationship?     No, relationships aren't for me.      No, I find it hard to get into relationships.      Yes.      No, not right now.      Yes, and in love!      Question 6: How popular would you say you are?     Does it matter?      I have a fair amount of good friends.      Not really, only have a few good friends, if any.      Pretty popular, I have quite a lot of friends.      Very, I'd say more people know of me, than I know them!      Question 7: Out of the following which do you most enjoy in life?     Cake!      Friends!      Fashion!      Winning!      Apples!      Question 8: What is your attitude towards work?     I try my hardest, slip up sometimes, but dedicate myself to it.      I put in a lot of effort, and set myself high aims.      Its very boring, I wish it were more interesting.      I get on with it, and in some ways I quite like it.      I find it hard to relax until its done, and put in a lot of concentration.      Question 9: If you were walking along the street and someone punched you, how would you react?     Scream, complain at the person and storm off.      Flinch, say nothing and run along quickly.      Demand an explanation! Walk off afterwards, do not conciliate.      Try my best to ignore them and get away from them.      If I had the Death Note Id write their name in it, thatll show them.      Question 10: What would you most like to have achieved in the future?     Power.      To be happily married.      I dont know, perhaps wealth?      Justice.      A good job.

20090128192417AA3Yg7s	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does the dark knight contain clues on the riddler, penguin and catwoman?	In a logical and quite brilliant piece of deduction, it's been suggested that characters in the Batman blockbuster The Dark Knight have been set up to become the villains Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman.      A commenter on The Geek Files has found possible clues in the film that indicate William Fichtner (right) could become the Penguin and that Joshua Harto's role is set to evolve into the Riddler. He also theorises that Bruce Wayne's Russian ballerina girlfriend Natascha, played by Beatrice Rosen, will become Catwoman.      Fichtner played the gun-toting bank manager who encountered the Joker in the opening robbery sequence, while Harto was Coleman Reese, a Wayne Enterprises employee who believed he'd figured out Batman and Bruce were one and the same.      This is unproven speculation of course, but it has a lot more logic than most of the online 'reports' where various names are randomly thrown into the air.      The commenter, called Brozic, recently added their views to an earlier article I'd written on villain possibilities for the next instalment. Brozic said: "The actors have already been decided and revealed in the Dark Knight." Read on to find out more!      He explains: "Look at the clues: Joshua Harto (pictured left, who played Coleman Reese) is the Riddler. The scene with him planning to blackmail Bruce Wayne is where he develops his hatred for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Not only this, but his name is Mr. Reese... "Mysteries". An alias of the Riddler."      "Next, the Penguin. William Fichtner. Disregard his bird-like appearance and there's still an abundance of clues. To start with, he's too good of an actor to be signed solely for two minutes as a bank owner.      "Secondly, while breaking into the vault, one of the guys mentions that it's a 'mob bank'. Penguin, in his original role, and in Batman: The Animated Series, is a mob leader.      "Thirdly, he gets shot in the leg which explains the Penguin's limp (meaning his waddling walk?). And finally, the Joker foreshadows the change when he says, "What doesn't kill you makes you stranger", alluding to a change in the bank manager."      Brozic adds that he believes Batman's girlfriend Natascha (Beatrice Rosen, right) will become Catwoman.      He said: "This one is not nearly as clear.. but it seems to fit. Natascha, the Russian ballerina that Bruce Wayne is dating, fits the romance between Batman and Catwoman's aliases, and also the Russian portrayal of Catwoman in the Adam West television series. The ballerina idea also helps the idea of why she would be light on her feet and acrobatic."      Of course, there's plenty of other speculation going around. Comments by producer Charles Roven regarding Heath Ledger's Joker that "we have to separate the actors from the role" have been interpreted to mean that another actor could play the archvillain, while Aaron Eckhart spoke about his role as Harvey Dent/Two-Face to MTV, saying: "I think Harvey - if he's not dead - is in a serious coma, and I'm not sure he's coming out. They might pull the plug on him.." That was interpreted by some sites to mean Two-Face is coming back.      I'm going to dismiss the Joker and Two-Face ideas because a) the quotes are being made to mean something they never said b) it would cheapen the first movie if Dent came back c) it's time for other villains d) fanboys are always unable to let go, I've seen this so often with other films (the X-Men franchise in particular)

Hov'ring there   I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung   My eager craft through footless halls of air.   Up, up the long delirious, burning blue,   I've topped the windswept heights with easy grace   Where never lark, or even eagle flew -   And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod   The high untresspassed sanctity of space,   Put out my hand and touched the face of God

I have a Marshall MG10CD Combo Amp and a Epiphone Les Paul Special II Electric Guitar. can any one tell me on how to set the amp and guitar to sound like it? i really wasn't planning to buy a new guitar or amp. I tuned my guitar down 1/2 step too. My amp only has a clean, overdrive, tone, and volume knob. not a bass, contour, or trebble knob. Also, i only have 2 pickups. some people say to get new pickups, but i don't know how to switch them. if theres any cheep pedals, can you tell me. If it's not that hard to switch the pick ups and they really do make a  big difference, could someone tell me how? I'm on a tight budget and i really wasn't planning on buying a new amp or guitar.

Lost has even more characters, but only has as many as two storylines per episode and at least they connect and add something to the show.

20090128203556AAmHF8o	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Virgo females. Will you please answer these questions?	If somebody you knew for say about a week, told you that they felt comfortable around you,and that you were easy to talk to, and they wanted to open up to you, how would you feel about this? And would you let this person open up to you?      What do you do if you have a crush on somebody? And how do you act around them? And how do you act toward them?      If you met somebody with alot of flaws, would you avoid them, Or would you help them to be a better person?      Why are you so critical, and what makes you that way?      Do you dislike compliments? And if so, would you try to learn how to take them?      Do you say one thing and do another, just to see what somebody would do? If so, do you think that this is rational?      what kind of humor do you like?       Would you compliment somebody on thier effort, even if the end result was terible, but you knew that they needed it?      What makes you so cocky?      If you met somebody that you didn't like, would you at least try to find a way around it, and try to make friends with them? Or would you give up on them, and avoid them at all costs?      If you met somebody that had a crush on you, but you didn't like them, would you at least give them a chance, or would you reject them?      Being honest and being rude are usually mixed up with you female virgos. giving your opinion when it is not asked for is rude. giving your opinion when it is, is being honest. Do you agree with this?      Virgo females please only answer this question. And try not to be critical of this question. Just be honest without being rude. Thank you.

20090406123022AA1ynY0	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What movie am I thinking of?	It's doing my brain in trying to remember which film this is. I only remember the ending:      The main character (I think played by Bruce Willis) has broken the law. His dad picks him up and they just drive. The dad is narrating what will happen. They'll find a sleepy little town (South USA-looking). They'll go into the bar and have one last drink together. Then the dad will drive away and they'll never see eachother again. After a couple of years when the heat has died down, he'll be able to contact his girlfriend. She'll come to live with him and they'll live happily ever after.      Then it cuts back to the main character and his dad in the car, driving down a sandy road and the credits begin to role.      What is they name of this movie?!? Thanks for any helpful answers!

20090225151246AAJ0y5r	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Noise Song For Wednesday #99 (I Heard It From A Friend, The Revolution Never Happened....Oooh, That Is So...)?	When this begins it is as though you have just intruded upon Ornette Coleman & Co. during an impromptu session...reeking improvisation. The horns squeak and the bass walks, walks, walks...walks. And it doesn't come off as being self-concious in its anti-music quality; not trying too hard to be 'odd' or 'off-the-wall'. The horns sound as though they are crossing into manhood; the glorious squeals and cracks. The drummer might as well be in his own world. And then at the 5:15 mark the synchronization and ascension upon chaos, before being reeled in yet again. And there's still thirty-two minutes left. And the last eleven minutes: wow. I hadn't any idea what I was getting into when I bought this album. All I saw was 'Free Jazz'. Oh, if I only had known of its zany quirks and unexpected twists. Ornette Coleman, I thank you.

I recently purchased an RG350DX and was blown away with the looks, sound but especially the feel of the guitar. However, the thing is built for metal and shred and I'm not that competent just yet although I do enjoy playing a bit of Metallica and Pantera now and again. What I am interested in is the classic rock and that kind of blues-rock that Gilmour,  Stevie Ray Vaughn, Page, Hendrix play. I'd say Metal to Classic/Blues ratio is about 35:65      Then again, I could see myself selling it and then wishing I hadn't afterwards.

20090225151224AAgenUv	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Help with name of this movie, about a ghost girl and a doll house? 10 points to correct answer?	It is from the 80's, maybe early-mid 90's. It starts out with the family in the car, they're moving to a new house. When they move there, the two siblings, brother and sister, go into the attic or something, and there's a doll house, and a little ghost girl who died many years ago (in the early 1900's I think). I think maybe she fell down/got pushed down a well? Oh and also, there's a recurring short poem or song in it.  I've wondered what this movie was for so very long. Please help!

20090128192651AAqZ19b	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	True Life: I'm Addicted to Meds. How was he smoking this?	I've been watching True Life: I'm Addicted to Meds on MTV for a couple of days now (...you know how MTV is with reruns...) and no matter how many times I see this I still don't quite understand what this one kid was doing.        He would put his pill on a flat piece of tin foil and use a lighter to burn the opposite side the pill was on. Then use a pipe (I guess) to smoke it???  But it didn't look like he was smoking.  There was only inhaling taking place.  And the pill was perfectly intact. It wasn't crushed or anything.      So my question is...what?  And how?  Does the lighter on the tin foil "melt" the pill, so he can sip it through almost like a straw? Or was he really smoking it?  Was it really a pipe he was using?  And what purpose does the tin foil serve?      I'm really confused by this.  I've never seen anything like that before in my life and I'm surprised they never blurred any of this out.  So, there has to be someone out there who has seen this episode or has some idea about what I'm talking about.

I have a relatively new amp. It has done this with every amp I've had, so don't blame the amp!      It fades in and out and in and out. I toggle the pick up selectors. I turn the knobs to do a setup via the amp and the guitar volume/tone knobs. It just fades in and out and acts like its not plugged in sometimes.      I've had it looked at at my guitar shop and the repairman sees nothing electronically wrong with it. I mean, its 16 years old. And its a Fender (not a fan of)...      So what can I do?

20090128191859AAs2VBr	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why is the media making such a big deal out of Jessica Simpon's recent weight gain?	Ashlee Simpson-Wentz has a bone to pick with those who say her sister is looking a bit meatier than usual.      "I am completely disgusted by the headlines concerning my sister's weight," Simpson wrote Tuesday on her website. "A week after the inauguration and with such a feeling of hope in the air for our country, I find it completely embarrassing and belittling to all women to read about a woman's weight or figure as a headline on Fox News."      Sure enough, Fox's website reported today that Jessica Simpson shocked fans Sunday at Radio 99.9 Kiss Country's Chili Cookoff in Pembroke Pines, Fla., with her "noticeably fuller figure" and had apparently "eased up on her fitness regimen a bit."  http://movies.yahoo.com/news/movies.eonl...       Edit:      Just to let you know.  I'm a little guy at 5'5" 135lbs and I dig girls with "booty" meat on them. ( ^ _ ^ ) Jessica Simpson's recent weight gain looks hot!

I am working on a project for school that requires us to make a soundtrack to a book. 1 song for each chapter and it is required that I have 10 chapters finished. I chose the book the Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan. I am not an avid listener of music so if you could give some suggestions that would be great. The book is a bit on the darker side and the main character is going insane so if the music could fall in that genera it would be nice. Just giving the name of a band is fine.

20090128202214AAaJ1e5	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What movie is this, and should my granddaughter see it?	Dear Yahoo Answers,    My granddaughter, Marcy moved in with her grandmother and I about 4 months ago today and she recently asked me to to take her to the movies. The movie she wants to see is playing at our local Dollar Theatre where you pay one dollar and you can see whatever movie that is playing that you want. There is a movie there that just came out that she has been begging Ellen (My spouse) and I to take her to see. It is called "Twilight." I don't know very much about it except the rating, which I am a bit concerned about because she is 12 years old and the rating is PG-13. I also saw a picture or poster or some other of the movie that she showed me and frankly, I thought it appeared somewhat sinister. I don't like scary movies very much myself and I don't want her to have nightmares. Does this movie have any cursing in it either, because I don't abide that. And lastly, is there any fornicating of any sort, because I don't want my granddaughter exposed to that at this point in her life. I myself would be uncomfortable with that sort of thing being around her, I only watch things like that when both she and Ellen are away. I'd appreciate any help you can offer to aid me in this research and I thank you for your time.    -Jack

20090128202316AAPolxO	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How can you love celebrities?	I really want to know how you can love The Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Robert Pattinson, and all those other celebs. I know that is a bit stereotypical but I tend to get more of the nutty fans from that group. I really want to know how you love them...I know you think they are hot but did you guys also know that love takes time and effort? You guys get so mad when we say that we hate those people because we don't know them...well you don't know The Jonas Brothers or any of them so how can you love them. I personally don't hate, I just get annoyed. I do have my strong likes for bands ;I would never chop of my boob and hand it to them on a silver platter either. Some nut said they would give everything they had to Nick Jonas. I am sorry that is plain stupidity and obsession. I do have my silly obsessions but some times they can destroy you and that is one of the examples. This person is going to realize that even if they give up their stuff Nick Jonas probably won't love her any more. I really want to know how you guys can actually love them hand and foot.   Stefani

20090128200845AAvdOkR	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Most unusual funeral procession?	A man was leaving a cafe with his morning coffee, when he noticed a most unusual funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery.    A long black hearse was followed by a second long black hearse about 50 feet behind the first.    Behind the second hearse was a solitary man walking a pit-bull on a leash. Behind him was a queue of 200 men walking in single file.      The man couldn't stand the curiosity. He respectfully approached the man walking the dog.       'I am so sorry for your loss, and I know now is a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen a funeral like this with so many of you walking in single file. Whose funeral is it?'      The man replied, 'Well, the first hearse is for my wife.'      'What happened to her?'       The man replied, 'My dog attacked and killed her.'       He inquired further, 'Well, who is in the second hearse?'      The man answered, 'My mother-in-law. She was trying to help my wife when   The dog turned on her.'      A poignant and thoughtful moment of silence passes between the two men.      'Can I borrow the dog?'       'Join the queue.'
20090128195854AAwdJWu	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Anouther paddy joke ?	Paddy and Colleen were making passionate love in Paddy's mini van when suddenly Colleen, being a bit on the kinky side, yells out "Oh big boy,whip me,whip me!"    Paddy, not wanting to pass up this unique opportunity, obviously did not have any whips on hand, but in a flash of inspiration, he opens the window, snaps the antenna off his van and proceeds to whip Colleen until they both collapse in ecstasy.    About a week later, Colleen notices that the marks left by the whipping are starting to fester a bit so she goes to the doctor. The doctor takes one look at the wounds and asks, "Did you get these marks having sex?"    Colleen, a little embarrassed that she has slept with Paddy [let alone that she allowed the kinky boy to whip her] eventually admits that, yes, she did.    Nodding his head knowingly, the doctor exclaims, "I thought so, because in all my years as a doctor you've got the worst case of van aerial disease that I've ever seen".

I'm a leo sun scorpio moon mars in aries and mars in the 7th house as well.   Can someone please explain this to me a little better.       You have Mars in the Seventh house. This being the main house for marriage and spouse, Mars here can creat a number of issues with your married life (this is the worst form of Kuja dosha). There may be a total mismatch between the sexual and emotional make up of husband and wife. If you are male, then it may give you very aggresive partner, you may be very unhappy and short tempered and not respected by your wife. If you are a female, then you may have to suffer the mental or physical torture from your husnabd, it may result in your husband's untimely death also. There is no other combination in your hart protecting you from the this dosha.This dosha seems to be 100% effective in your chart and you need to consult a competent astrologer for further analysis.            thanx in advance.

Sadly, I haven't met many fans of (or even people who have heard of) the movie. It's sort of obscure, I suppose.   What did you think? I'd love to discuss. :)

No one knows for sure how old he was,   since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He   will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as:   Knowing when to come in out of the rain;  Why the early bird gets the   worm;  Life isn't always fair; and maybe it was my fault.      Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't  spend   more than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, not children,   are in charge).      His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned but   overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-old boy   charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended   from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for   reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.      Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the   job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unruly   children.      It declined even further when schools were required to get parental   consent to administer sun lotion or an Aspirin to a student; but could   not inform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an   abortion.      Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses;   and criminals received better treatment than their victims.      Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a   burglar in your own home and the burglar could sue you for assault.      Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to   realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in   her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.      Common Sense was preceded in death, by his parents, Truth and Trust, by   his wife, Discretion, by his daughter, Responsibility, and by his son, Reason.      He is survived by his 4 stepbrothers;   I Know My Rights   I Want It Now   Someone Else Is To Blame   I'm A Victim      Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.     If you still remember him, pass this on. If not, join the majority and do   nothing.
