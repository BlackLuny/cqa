(i need lots of answers if possible!?	*Compared to my last question, this is similar but has more detail, yet it's a little shorter because I cut out some of the run-on stuff!!!    I’m fifteen years old and in my last year of junior high. I’ve always felt a little self-conscious about my appearance, mostly because I’m a total perfectionist, but I want that to end! I want to feel pretty and confident! I’m going to make all the necessary changes to be prettier by mid-May, that way I have plenty of time and I will have way more fun for the last few weeks of school, throughout summer, throughout high school, etc.    Okay, so I have light brown hair with layers and bangs. My hair is average thickness, straight, and about an inch past my shoulder. I almost always leave my hair down and straight. I have hazel-green eyes, rosy cheeks, and only get zits occasionally. My eyes are average to big, my nose is average, my lips are average, and I have straight fairly white teeth. My skin is also fairly light, not white but certainly not tan. I weigh 115 pounds and I’m 5’ 2’’. I’m also quite curvy for my height and fairly small frame.    I want tips on how to lose a few pounds, how to tone my body, how to style my hair really cute, what make-up would look great on me, how to get a natural-looking tan, what kind of clothes to wear, etc, etc, etc. By the way, I’m going for a more “preppy” look.

Okay, so I'm trying to convince my parents to let me get my septum pierced for my 16th birthday.. And every time I've ever asked for a piercing they find some horrible thing that can go wrong..    And so far I've only found that it can get infected or if the jewelry is heavy it can 'droop'.  but that can happen with any piercing...    My dad for some reason is afraid that if I get sick something will happen and I wont be able to sing anymore. and he knows that the septum has nothing to do with the sinus's or anything like that...    So am I missing something? Is there something that can go seriously wrong.    P.S  Don't waste your time by telling me how stupid the septum piercing looks. :] Because I think it's hot.

20090131124917AAJnBBo	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Why does bodyshop give these instructions for there cleanser?	i am using aloe range cleanser and toner from the body shop,i am using the lotion as i prefer these type of things,although a mary kay worker or someone who did work for them,has told me that using this type where you just massage over the face and wipe off,is not going to help someone like me who although i have sensitive skin does have acne due to pcos and spots,she said it is like just rubbing all the dirt makeup etc around the face and then not removing it or properly because its not a wash etc,but i must admit since using this i feel that and see my skin has improved,i feel that i've had thorough makeup removal as you can see what your removing on the cotton pad,but i could wash it off it  its necessary as the instructions on the website say so.   But also on the body shop site under the aloe rangemwhen you go to cleansers they have a wash which i used previously,it says to use it after the clensing lotion which is what i've got! why would you cleanse with a lotion first and then use the wash after too,i thought whatever you are using as long as includes makeup removal on the label,and you are washing or wiping it off then its ok,you don't use 2 products,some people have told me to at night or when taking off  makeup to use the same clenaser twice,the other reason i liked none wash ones,is cause you can see and repeat until all traces of everything are off your face,whereas with a wash how can you tell,i sometimes felt when using a wash that i wet the face well but when i applied the product it evaprated into nothing as though there was too much on the surface to dissolve. Please explain the body shops instruction to me if you can,and give advice on my general point about clenasing. Thanks

20090131112754AAvLjAK	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Ladies, have you ever had to?	Have you ever slapped a guys face good by using a move on him where you stand with with your weight on 1 side and put your hand on top of your hip and stand there for a second, then whip your opposite hand out and slap his face? I need to know if you've used this messed up move on a guy before, and also tell me if any guy has been successful at being able to block that move? Seriously. I had a girl who used that move on me, and when she put her left hand on her hip, i had no damn idea what she was gonna do, but i was watching her left hand anyway, then she *slapped* my face HARD with her right. I don't know how the hell to block that. Worse, i've also seen a girl use it on a guy, and he couldn't block that move from her either, she got him too. I know better than to hit girls back, but i thought(used to)that it would be really easy, just reach out and block a girls hand when she goes to slap. hahahaha! i can't, that crap doesn't work, not on THAT move! What does? Have you ever had to use that on a guy? Was HE able to block it? I dunno if we even can.

20060719134339AA8TjZp	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is this weird looking?	Im a guy and i'm hairy. I got hairy arms [not like werewolf arms but they are pretty hairy for a white guy- you can really see the brown hair]. I also have hair all over my chest and stomach. I have hairy legs and a hairy butt (all over my butt). I already got a Laser Hair Removal treatment on my back and shoulders. Do you think having a hair free back and shoulders and then having hair in all the other places I mentioned would look weird? Is it normal for guys who arent that hairy to have hair on there butt [im not talking about peach fuzz which cant be noticed]. It dosent bother me, I dont sweat back there and it dosent itch. But I was wondering if its a real turn off for the ladies?      Thanks.

20090131105707AAD74iB	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair Coloring Problems! PLz Help! why isn't my hair the right color?	Ok so last thursday night (2 days ago) i dyed my hair a deep plum with the loreal superior preferences home dying kit. i followed the instruction given except for one. the only intruction i didnt follow was : use entire contents of the color optimizing bottle.   i didnt use all of the contents because i had recently cut my hair real short (to my chin!) so i thought i wouldnt need that much since i had short hair now. so after shaking together the contents of the first 2 bottles as it said in the instructions i put in about half of the bottle in my short hair.   today, the saturday after, i checked the bottle because it said in the instructions to throwaway any leftovers. when i looked at the container to throw the contens out the color had changed from the burgundy color of when i put it in my hair, to a purple almost black.    another thing im confused about is, whyisnt my hair the color shown in the picture on the box!!!??? im not talaking about the model's hair color, im talking about the color of the before and after pics!!      im just really confused. i need answers plz from experienced home-hair dyers.

20090131105052AAFEL5F	Beauty & Style;Hair	How to get rid of lice?	The neighbor's kid had lice, so I checked my girls and they both had it too.  I did their hair with the lice shampoo (mine too just in case) and then went through it picking out the eggs.        I also washed all their clothes, jackets, hats, bedding, etc, and vacummed their car seats.        I waited a week, re-shampooed my hair with it, changed the bedding again, vacuumed the car again, and then went to work on their hair again with the shampoo (the instructions say to do it again 7-10 days after the first treatment to kill any newly hatched lice).      On my younger daughter, I only found 2 eggs, no bugs.      But on my 8-year-old, I found probably 8 bugs and probably a good 10-15 eggs.  The eggs and the tiny bugs went down the drain.  The larger ones went into a ziplock bag so I could look at them closely.  All four were still alive, even though I left the treatment on for the full 10 minutes (actually a little longer).  I watched them in the bag for a good hour, and they didn't die.        So it's apparent that the shampoo is not efficient enough, and those egg combs they provide don't do anything.  The eggs stay there on the hair and I have to pull them down the hair shaft with my nails.      I've been researching, and found that mayo doesn't work.  Anyone else have.      After I finally get the lice out of her hair, HOW DO I STOP HER FROM GETTING IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE?  If the kids in her class or school have it, won't it just continue to spread back and forth between them all?  How do I keep her from getting it again?
