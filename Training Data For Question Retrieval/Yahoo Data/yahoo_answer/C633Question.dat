20090219205123AA5Wvwb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why don't I fit in with everyone at work?	I'm 18 and I've had a retail job for a few months.   Everyone at work hangs out togther outside of work.   They are all friends, and I'm not included in any of this.   I don't know what the deal is. I never have trouble making friends at all.   I'm really friendly and it's not like I'm ugly or anything.   I don't know what the deal is.   It honestly hurts my feelings.

20090219205246AAPdpij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have many guys said or done this to you? or if you are a guy, do you say or do these things?	On the computer when I talk to guys, so far all of them have told me something like "I'm going to take a shower". I think it is weird that they all said it.       and also many of them have started a game of truth or dare with me, which I was like really confused why they did that. I was wondering of other guys said and did stuff like this. not just the guys I talk to.       btw they are not gay just to get that detail out in the open.

20090219205641AARukVv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How neat is it for your 15 year old son to think that you are cool enough to go see Friday the 13th with him?	Price of admission to movie $12.      Popcorn and coke $10.      Quality time with teenage son, priceless.

20090219205506AAyC9pq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many dates should I wait before I invite her back to my place to hang out?	I met this girl and I kind of like her and wouldn't mind getting to know her. I'd like to ask her back to my house to hang out. But I've always heard that I should wait a bit before inviting her back. I'm assuming that's because she'll assume that I'm inviting her back for sex. What do you think?
20090219205604AAFgMGx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I stupid? Please help me?	My nut-case ex-wife caught me at the Wal-Mart parking lot this afternoon and demanded money from me. I was a little tanked and cocky so I told her she ain't gitt'n squat from me and I whipped out a $50 bill and set it on fire right in front of her. At the time I though I really got one over on her but looking back on the situation all I can think of is I burned up $50 worth of beer.   How does she do this to me? Is she really satan after all?
20090219205505AAzV56m	Family & Relationships;Family	Anyone had accusing parents like this? How to deal?	My parents love to accuse me of things and treat my sister like a princess.      1) When I was 10-15, they would constantly remind me they work hard for me. They didn't mention they also work for the mortgage, my sister and themselves. Constantly blame me for the miserable family business.      2) Since I was 12 to now at 37, whenever my dad asks my opinion on something or I say something that doesn't agree with him, he would start yelling and shaking his fists in air and accusing me of trying to undermine him. He would only yell this loud at my house so my neighbors can hear it.      3) I gave my parents a Chinese New Year Red Envelope, which was not required, with $20 each and they felt insulted and accuse me of not loving them. Nobody gives their parents money for Chinese New Year.      4) My dad would say how I couldn't make it in the world at a big company. I finally got a job at a big company and I said to him that I did it and he got mad by accusing me of saying he's wrong.      I think my parents are wrong. Most of my friends parents support them in encouragement and help them out in life. When I got a house or move up in my career, they yell and start accusing me. Only when I am depressed, they back off.       I told them how I feel and just to ask them to NOT accuse me and to defend me in the future. What do you think?
20090219205720AACdJY9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is he just confused?  A man's opinion, please.?	The main man in my life keeps getting scared every time there's the slightest bit of trouble with us.  We've broken up twice as a result.  It may just be a coincidence, but we looked at wedding rings right before both breakups.  He uses that as a reason--meaning, he says "We were just looking at wedding rings and I don't know if you're the right girl for me" etc.  I'm 23, and he's 25 if that's any help as far as our maturity goes.       He also says things like "I don't want to lose you," and "I love you and I'm not interested in anyone else, I just don't know if I want to be with you." He comes over just to see me and my dog.  He stares longingly into my eyes and says how much he loves me,  but that he "doesn't want to blindly follow his heart."        It may seem obvious to all of you cynics out there that he's just trying to let me down easily, but he's being sincere and I can feel that he loves me (if that doesn't sound too desperate or whatever...)        Any help is appreciated.  Thanks!
20090219205612AAbiA64	Family & Relationships;Family	I have problems with my dad,and i dont want to stop loving him as my father.?	im 14, teenage years i know. haha   well my dad, hes just not the best, and i try so hard to bite my tongue in situations but he is always yelling even when i do something he tells me to! just the sound of his voice starts to make me cringe... i love him, he is my dad. but how can i when he doesn't even respect me. i know he is going through hard times (my mother is depressed and was in the hospital for a week) but i just want a dad you know? i want to be a daddy's girl, instead of the the girl who hates him.       he blames me for alot, and they always ask me to do over the boarder chores around the house! i am the oldest of two younger brother, but i mean i have a life,as well as school work.   but dont you think setting th table to eat then cleaning up then sweeping afterward is a little much... and not even asked nicely?      what is your advice on how i should approach the situation with my dad, any advice is accepted but something need to change, im done with crying all the time!!!

20090219205714AAghLIk	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when you findnout one of your friends...?	Ok. So last year I was in a group of friends but only 2 of the 3 other girls actually liked me. One of the girls who liked me goes to a different school now. Since the other 3 of us became cheerleaders, the one who never liked me has gotten more friends and more social and popular. The other girl who was my friend now likes being with the other girl mrs than me because she likes all the attention. We've recently gotten closer, and she likes me more. However, she still hangs out with the girl who doesn't like me just about all the time. I go with them, but the girl who doesn't like me told me to stop following them around. How can I hang out with my friend and avoid the girl who doesn't like me? I'm not really an extremely social person, so making new friends is difficult for me. Please don't say she's not a real friend, she really is.

20090219210512AAt0kO9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm in love with a man that doesn't pay rent (or anything else) and he won't marry me.  What should I do?	I have been in a relationship off and on for the last three years.  When I met my boyfriend he was going through a divorce and couldn't  afford his apartment any longer.  He decided to move in with his parents.  I asked him to move in with me.  We were both under the agreement that when he could he would start helping with bills.  That was two years ago and still nothing!  I've moved to another apartment since then and when I bring up this issue-he gets mad.  He tells me that it was my idea to move to a 975.00 apartment so I need to pay for it. The funny thing is I moved into a bigger place so his daughter could have her own room when she comes over to visit.  I pay for everything from the electricity to the groceries.  He doesn't feel that he should pay for food he doesn't eat.  I am also afraid to bring it up, because it ends up into a huge argument.  We are both teachers, therefore we make the same amount of money.  He is getting out of debt and I'm living paycheck to paycheck.  In addition to that he doesn't want to marry me.

20090219211122AAY1wL1	Family & Relationships;Friends	My roomate doesn't like all the guns and knives I keep stashed around the house. How do I convince her?	I really like having them around because one time when I was young some guy broke in and my dad shot the bastard. Turns out he was some sort of violent mentally handicapped person I think. Anyways, I think it better to be safe than sorry so I keep this stuff stored everywhere. I told her if she want to use one to train she can do it anytime and then she would be more comfortable if she did, but she refuses. She says I'm more likely to shoot her and I told her I wouldn't unless she attacked me, but that just made her more upset and she cried. How do I convince her to let me keep them?

My friend was telling me stuff in confidence as a way of venting and one of the things he said was that he hates commitments where he sees no end in it.      Um does that include marriage?  Because marriages don't end unless you divorce or die.      We aren't in a relationship it was just a casual conversation but can marriage be one of those commitments with no end?

20090219212026AALIyxK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	NEED HELP PLZ!! School dance: Too early to ask her?	I am a senior guy in HS and I like this girl who is a sophomore in HS. We have know each other for about 2 years, mainly through church Youth group. I haven't really hung out with her before, and she is coming over friday after school to hang out for a little while. I'm not sure if she knows that i like her or not, so to her it may just be chilling until the basketball games and then split go to the dance afterwards. Would it be too soon to ask her to dance at the school dance(as in "I don't really know you yet and I don't want to make it awkward", not "i can't ask you to the dance b/c it's too far away")? I've only known her as a friend, and I really don't want to make things awkward between us if she isn't comfortable dancing with an upperclassmen. What do I do? Is it too soon to ask?Would it be advantageous to wait? If she will dance with me, is that some sort of confirmation that she is interested in me? Thanks.

Anyway, tonight we went to the movies and then he brought me home and walked me to my door. We kissed for a minute and then he said he'd call me later. Is it rude that I didn't invite him in? I didn't want him to get the wrong idea about me, because I really like him....he is so sweet and I can already tell he is someone that I could fall for. Will he think that I don't like him or at least don't like him that much since I didn't? I'm divorced and back into the single world after being married for 7 years....I'm 27.

20090219211219AA8mXA8	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can anyone relate to losing friends?	Last year my life was going perfect, and then all of a sudden i was forced to change schools, now this was a big deal but i figured i'd still have my 2 best friends. Well a couple months later they started drifting away, we were always a group of 3, and all equally close to eachother. One day we got into a big argument and both of them vowed to never be my friend again. Now about a year later, I am only friends with one, we are not as great of friends, but we are still close. The other however, still refuses to be my friend. I still miss our friendship but i realized that we most likely will never be friends again. I'm wondering if anybody has gone through something like this, losing your best friends, it is a very touchy issue and i'm sure many people have struggled through it.      I have friends at my new school but they dont even begin to compare to the ones that i used to have, and i dont seem to have any close friends, just sort of class friends.

20090219211723AAVfLLz	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I move out of my parents house?	I am 21 years old with a 10 month old baby girl. My ex and I recently split up so I moved back home with my parents. At first, it was okay. Now I'm absolutely miserable. I feel like I am serving a prison sentence. I can never do anything right with my daughter. If I even brush her hair wrong, I get bitched out. My mom gets mad if I want to leave just one saturday night to hang out with my friends. I guess she expects me to be locked in the house forever. She also won't allow me to work full-time. I've even found a nice day-care and paid for the registration. My baby isn't even allowed to see her daddy unless he comes to our house to visit. He wants to see her on weekends and I would like a little free time to do stuff with friends and a guy I like. But my mama won't let him have her.      I think it's time for me to be on my own and be the only one that makes decisions for my daughter. I think I am a great mom but sometimes I second guess myself living here. Should I move out and stay here longer to save  up some more money?  I am an LPN so I make pretty decent money working part-time.

By the way I'm a straight guy. Ive just previously asked the question " why is it ok for gay men to physically touch females in a sexual way? " I got a lot of the same answer from women, and the answer i got the most was that : " he's gay so theres no  real sexual attraction ". So heres my real question. If your a girl and you agree with the idea that gay men have the right to touch you like that, how would you respond to your boyfriend who you love being felt up and touched sexually by a lesbian ?  would you have a problem with that ? and if so, why can you( girls in general ) have a problem with gay women touching us , when us guys can't have a problem with gay men touching ouir girlfirends ?

20090219213702AAWFw1h	Family & Relationships;Friends	I caught my office mate wacking it in the office under his desk! Should I say something?	He really seemed embarrassed and I just didn't say anything and sat down and tried to work, but I can't because the image is burned into my eyes! I don't know what to do. Especially because all the pictures on his desk are of his family. Its weird and messed up. I'm mean, I've been tempted to do it, but never actually did it. Seems wrong is all. Should I tell on him? I have proof because I took a pic with my phone.
20090219214120AAnFCeH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I accidentally called my gf Marissa (a really hot model) during sex and now she is mad. How do I fix it?	Yeah, I was totally thinking of a supermodel and not her, but this is the first time I accidentally yelled it out. She was mad so I finished and left and went to a coffee shop. How do I make it up to her? Its not that I don't find her attractive, its just that I find the supermodel more attractive. I could never get a supermodel because I'm not rich so I have to pretend you know?

I went on a date with this dude ..and it was sort of Blah. not bad just not like ...you know. i had two exes who when we first met we just clicked. it was instant, almost like love at first sight but i dont believe in that so thats what i think is chemistry.

20090219213729AAGlO7Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really just need genuine advice. I haven't had a good week.?	So I am 15 and a daughter to very strict persian parents. I feel as though my mother is the cause of my father being strict as well. I think as I get older I should be allowed to get more privileges such as staying out later or just being able to go out more. However, my mom still treats me like I'm 10. My sister is almost 18 and she is getting treated pretty much the same way as I am. I just want my mom to be like my best friend where I can tell her everything and tell her where I'm going without her yelling and saying no. But this is not the case and my sister and I end up having to lie to be able to go out sometimes. I know if this continues..once I am out of the house my mom will lose me because i will be too busy experiencing the little things I hadn't while I was with her. How can I talk to my mom and dad about this? I've tried telling them what you are reading here but nothing has changed.
20090219215253AAv6mSN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when you don't like any of the women who like you nor what turns them on about you?	I hate how I look. I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something. I don't care if some guys would wish they were bigger...and hearing that some girls actually like big bald guys makes me feel worse. That may be difficult to understand...think of it this way: some guys find fat girls totally sexy, but that doesn't mean a fat girl will appreciate the fact that a guy notices her extra pounds. It's the same way with me....I'm not so desperate for acceptance that any girl who tells me "I love a big man" will make me change my thinking (though I joke that Kate Winslet or Anne Hathaway could make me reconsider it).      I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments. Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure. Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more. This seems to be standard among many women...what was creepy was how many of them told me (in bed) that I reminded them of their father.      I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature. I hate it, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know how to get over it. I did virtually everything save get a toupee: I did Rogaine and Propecia, I had hair transplants done by the best surgeon in Beverly Hills (on Rodeo Drive, no less).      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty". Also, don't tell me that "the right girl" won't care how I look...we all care about appearances. Those who claim not to care are either those trying to avoid seeming shallow or those who cannot afford to be choosy.

20090219214635AA8qWiN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Ex is unsure if she wants to be friends and so am i?	before I get started if you want a full view of my relationship read prob my first 3 questions on YA?       Quick summary, Just before myself and my ex's 1 yr she broke up with me......shortly afer ended up messing with this guy. From wishful thinking and seeing pictures online and our 1 year anniversy and it being christmas timethe whole nine i was emotionally torn apart. this was all back in december      She still to this day is with this guy, now she dates him " officially".  Me and her rarely talk, if ever. She has her new man,I'm livin it up being single we both are doing out own thing.              Today she instant messages me about do i miss her?....(which anyone can think that I must have been or currently am on her mind) i tell her "basically not anymore had it been 2 months ago yes" etc. Then she talks about us not talkin and not even being friends etc. I tell her that i feel like my efforts to be a friend are drawn out of me from everything back when we first broke it off. later in the conversation it gets to me saying i'm still cool  with you and we have no problems. She then replies she feels like its her and she doesnt think she can handle being "just friends" b/c if she knew or saw me with others girls she'd still feel some type of way.      honestly I'm more so asking what does this mean? and should i still go amongst my life with her in the rear view, or attempt to at least be cool with her, also a good amount  of me still has strong feelings       I'm a 20 y.o. in college, I've had a whole lot of crazy college fun but she was the only girl who made me feel, and act completely different words dont describe it............yet am i just reminiscing       but for the record i have moved on with my life , i still have feelings for her but I dunno what would come of me and her in the future....
20090219215441AAmF0N3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex bf told me the reason he asked me to borrow $$ vs his gf was so she wouldn't get stressed out. um..hello?	Before I begin let me make it very clear that both my husband and his girlfriend are aware we talk.   Here we go...this guy was my first love, and clearly things didn't work out.  We have since (the last 8 years) remained friends, and have a pretty open communication.  I know he waste a lot of money, and is an impulse buyer.  So it upset me that he called me for 1100 bucks to get his car fixed, and when I asked him why he didn't ask his girlfriend he said because she would get all stressed out, so I asked "so you would rather stress me out?" and he said NO but that I was probably more financially stable then people he knew.  Am I wrong for not feeling this?   Earlier last year I was on a business trip to his home state, and he agreed to take me out and show me around town since I would be there for a week.  Well...when I got there he said he was broke and could not afford to do anything for me, I thought he was being honest so I paid for everything we did, restaurants and all.  After all this was supposed to be my good friend. (Right!) Here's when my moment of clarity came...There has always been someone more important then me in his life, which is why we originally split.  He loves his gf so much (at least to me) that he wants to spare her from stressing out over needing money to fix his car he asked me.  Why can't I be extended the same respect because I am married now and have my own set of problems and responsibilities.   Am I wrong here?  How do I effectively say no, and break it down without being harsh?

It ranges all the way from him actually never liking me to begin with to us going on one date and he realizes he doesn't like me to.... us kind of dating for like 4 months and he realizes he doens't like me....

20090219220101AA7JxuM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Friends and relationships?	I've been a little depressed these past couple of years.   I started shutting out all my friends completely isolating myself in my house.   Every date i go on ends up being the first and only date because i can no longer function as a human being.   I'm completely against the idea of using drugs to heal my problem.   I am strong christian that reads and prays daily.   I'm starting to feel more and more alone as the days go by.   Every time i'm welcomed into a new group of friends i end up shutting them out completely without explanation or reason.   I'm not suicidal, and i don't want to be alone.   Everything is tumbling down at a very fast pace.      A) what's wrong with me?   B) how can i fix it?   C) is it unhealthy?      But through all of this i was able to drop from 220lbs to 170lbs in one year, i've become very obsessed over my own body and cringe every time i step on a scale.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 9 months everything is going fine but she wants me to LIE !!! And this is a big problem for me. She wants me to say those 3 magic words that alllll Women crave to hear and those words being "I Love You" . She is constantly asking me whether I love her or not and i knowing how women operate don't flat out tell her "NO" because then i get the common female reaction of-- "ohh your so Mean" .

And i still get that reaction "Your so Mean." So i don't know what to do .

20090219214123AADzdm3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell my husband he raped me?	I grew up in a small town. When I was 11 I got raped and my mom saw the blood and I told her what happened, she thought it would be best if we didn't tell anyone so we didn't report it. I moved away for college, got married, and never really thought about it until we moved back to my town for a job and my husband now works with this man who raped me 11 years ago and he has no idea. I know this is going to sound selfish but even though I should be over it now I just can't stand the thought of my hubby being friends or even acquianted with him, it just hurts. I'm not trying to be selfish I don't know what's wrong with me. I never told my husband I got raped because I don't like talking about it and being asked about it, there's no point anyway. I don't know why I feel like I want to tell him, but I know I shouldn't. Maybe the feeling will go away? I don't know. Please help me out. I'm 22 and my husband is 24 and I would say this man is possibly in his late 40's. I don't want him to leave his job or anything, I just don't want them to get too close. I don't want my husband to mention it to him though. If I tell him I just want him to act like nothing happened. What should I do? I don't want to ruin our marriage and I don't want him to be mad at me for telling him.          (marriage & divorce)

20090219213331AAiOJ4V	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help me please! i don't know what to do?	I've got a little problem in that well i like this girl and the other day i went for a walk with her and eventually went back to her place to play some sort of game which doesn't matter. This was a great idea and worked out perfectly because i think we really hit it off. The only problem is that on my way out of the house, her brother walked in and hes kind of a friend of mine even tho hes not one of my closer friends. He asked me what i was doing there and i just said i was hanging out and i told him i had to go and i left for home. The problem is that that last moment was REALLY awkward, and i see both of them and their parents this saturday... I don't know what to do. I have a feeling its going to be very awkward again. Should i act as if my hanging out with his sister was nothing, because i am trying to tell this girl that i have feelings for her and i feel that pretending it was nothing will do the exact opposite. Or should i just stick with my idea that i did what i did for a main purpose and i have no regrets about doing it? Please help me, i just don't know what to do and i really like this girl.

20090219213018AAlAvpE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Caribbean/Afro-American girl and an Asian guy?	How do you all feel about this? I mean, I have dated an Australian, a mixed guy, Haitian guy, and Puerto Rican guy. I have no issue dating a person and not a race but I am curious as to how you all feel?      There is this Asian guy I find highly attractive. We pass eachother in the halls often for the past 7 months. He went from smiling at me to looking away or frowning. Today, I saw him 3 times and psyched myself into talking to him. I saw him sitting a few feet away from the register in our university cafeteria and I was rollerblading so I took my rollerblades off at his table, got my food and almost left without saying anything. I walked up to him and said "I don't know what has been holding me back from saying this, but I think you are really cute." he nearly jumped out of his skin. He yanked his bluetooth out of his ear and said "Wha--?? Me??" I smiled and turned to walk away and he asked my name and wanted to introduce himself. Me being a complete idiot shook his hand, turned around, and skated away as fast as possible. While I was eating outside he saw me and said bye to me as he passed with a smirk.      I don't know what any of that means, and I don't want to date right now because I am not ready to again, but if you could answer these two questions:      1- How do you feel about Caribbean/African American girls and Asian guys?   2- What do you think he meant by the things he did?

He is twice her age and all she does is talk about how fantastic he is!!      She is even paying people to take photos of him for her! She knows his full name, adress and has found his Myspace profile, and lets face it, she's practically stalking him!      This has happened twice before, with 2 other older guys, she hardly even knows them, and she starting following them around. About a year later, when she's found out everything about him, she realises they're a total idiot and moves on to another guy!      My other friends and I have all tried to tell her to stop, but that just pisses her off. She is getting on everyone's nerves, and I've tried to push her away, because she is a bad influence and I'm getting sick of her always putting her crushes before her friends.      She has caught on, and now she isn't talking to me, what should I do ?

20090219215649AAtbH3Q	Family & Relationships;Friends	Tips on making friends in high school?	would it be weird if in the middle of the year (with me having a boring impression this whole time) i try to join in with a close group of people? not close to me but like really really close to each other. i mean it'd be weird because they have so much things to talk about together and i would eventually end up being left out of the conversation. the only thing i could say are things about homework and school stuff, which i did. but if they're already real close and if i joined in their conversation or their lunch table or something, wouldn't they kind of be annoyed with me or see me as desperate? and they don't seem like the kind of people who especially love new people and like their 'tight' friends. they're not a clique or anything, just a close group of friends,around 6 people?   what should i do? if i try to be friends with them, would they be annoyed (like if this was your case, would you be annoyed with me? honestly)?
20090219220040AAPabyS	Family & Relationships;Friends	I made a dull high school first impression?	as boring and dull and not stylish lol.   so for the rest of my freshmen year, am i stuck in this label? it's gonna be impossible to change it now until next year.

20090219220036AASJmE7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do NOT answer if you're gonna be rude...but what are the odds in this case?	so on friday the 13th i had a rose delivered to this boy i met over the summer with the message "i've been missing you." but i did not have the guts to put my name on it. i am a freshman and he is a sophomore. i am in this play at his school (i go to an all-girls school and he goes to an all boys school) and today there seemed to be a lot of boys hanging out by the theater. i wasn't wearing my contacts today so my vision was pretty bad (-2.00 and -2.50). so i could only see the outlines of people. however, these 3 boys came in at the start of our rehearsal...i turned around quickly and thought i saw him/my crush (but i couldn't see his face clearly). my first thought was: omg is it him? i thought i recognized parts of his face, the outline of his body and his stature. he came to one of my rehearsals in the fall (just randomly) when i was in a play with upperclassmen, but i didn't think he was there to see me that time (to make a long story short). i looked back at him again when he was leaning on the table, and just the way he did it reminded me of him. but I'M NOT SURE IT WAS HIM BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE HIS FACE clearly. i think he knows i am the one who sent him the rose (it was a flower exchange between our schools)...i mean, considering our circumstances, it's not that hard to figure out even tho i didn't put my name on it. okay, don't tell me i sound like i'm 12 (just don't answer if that is what ur thinking), or whatever....but what are the chances that it was him i saw even tho i couldn't see clearly? or was it just my mind jumping to conclusions, cus i had been thinking about him coming before our rehearsal that day/wondering if he would do the same typa thing he has done in the past. it's the typa thing he would do and has done (enforcing his physical presence), and he's done stuff like this before. he had to go before i could look at him again, so idk. i still like him a ton

20090219220007AAgOYWD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has this happened to you he left you for good then came back...?	My boyfriend of one year and a half broke up with me over some drama basically i did a mistake and he believe other people over me.I do still care for him and wonder if he will ever look for me again.We have been broken up for a month and i am doing my best to move on keeping my mind busy just working on myself.Truth is our relationship wasn't the same even the sex.He is prideful-when we would argue guess who would be the one calling or showing up me.I know now he wont if he bearley did call before unless we werent fighting.I know he does care for me because it was over a year it's logical but i was wondering if this has ever happened to you.You were in a relationship for over a year or more he broke it off with you and you were heartbroken and had to move on and he contacted you after being a complete jerk.I haven't called him i tried once but he was an ashole.This is progress for me and i actually am doing ok without him.Just need to hear any other relationship story that sound's similar and he cameback out of the blue when you gave up hope he would ever.
20090219214711AACNaHG	Family & Relationships;Family	Douchebag Father..need some advice?	to start off my father is a complete asshole, and im 16      he makes everyone in the household angry, especially me, and blames us.    it gets to a point that i say to myself im moving out on my 18th birthday never coming back and changing my last name.       (yeah its that bad he makes me ridiculously angry, and when i punch my bed a few times to take out my anger he just pisses me off more)      he blows things way out of proportion      example1   i have some dust on my dresser]      him: how many times do i have to tell you. your room is a complete mess. want me to lock you out? go live in a tent in the backyard. you can sh*t in it for all i care.   me: *speechless thinking "just shutup already you talk way too much"         example 2   [father and mom argument]   -my mom washes the tea pot the night before-   him: *yells from the kitchen* where is the tea pot?   mom: *goes out to kitchen* *points it out to him*   i come out to get some water (just woke up)   him: what the hell? your mom doesnt teach you to greet me in the morning?      and then hes pissed off the rest of the day.. along with added work pressure and he blows it off on me.. theres not really any hitting just talking like a douchebag and getting eevryone pissed off.. ALSO if i clench my fists while he is talking or flex my jaws he just boils my blood even more by saying "what am i your father? are you my father? you act like such an asshole"          my real question:    are there any government programs that help out desperate 18 year olds get off on the right footing?

20090219213522AA7p0QM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does it feel like my friends aren't true friends?	I feel like I don't have true friends. I have a friend that sometimes puts me down and gets mad at me over nothing and does little things that piss me off. I have another friend that has the biggest ego, and thinks all the girls love him. And lastly I have a friend who's changed and drinks and smokes weed now. She's turning into a *****.   I had a different friend but we are no longer friends no, she does drugs and has sex 24/7. I feel like everyone around me isn't a true friend anymore. I'm probably one of the nicest people and i feel like they don't treat me right. I've been really unhappy with everything around me lately. Also i don't have alot of guy friends so these 2 kids tend to say im a fag and that i hang out with too many girls.      What should i do?

20090219214019AAsIzg9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Advice on visitation when dad lives out of state!!?	My husband is active duty Navy. We live in CA and his 5 year old daughter lives in IL. He currently has an order giving him 6 consecutive weeks each summer, every fathers day, every other b-day, and alternate all holidays. He had to fight for the 6 weeks to be consecutive because mom wanted them split up. The judge told mom to choose between paying for the extra travel or allow the six weeks to be consecutive. Mom refused to pay (of course).  That order was entered when the child was 4 and in daycare. She is now 5 and in public school. Would a judge allow more time in the summer now that she is in school? Also, now that she can fly alone according to the airlines, do you think a judge could enforce that as well. It's not that we want the child to fly alone, but why buy 2 additional roundtrip tickets if they are not needed? My husband also can't just take time off to fly back and forth being in the military. One long visitation would be better on the child that numerous throughout the year. Do you think a judge would agree? The child also has a step-sister, half-sister and half-brother out here in CA that I think she deserves to know. We pay $415/month in support and have never missed a payment. Pay 100% medical and dental as well.

20090219214516AAAlgvq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I let it go and be happy with what I have?	My birthday was very recent and my husband (married under one year) did not buy me anything, or even get me a card.  He says he is broke and will get me something in a few days...he keeps suggesting things he can get me, and keeps talking about it.      I appreciate that he didn't just forget and it is on his mind but the fact that he made no effort to budget his money and get me anything on the actual day bothers me.      The day of my birthday he wished me happy birthday a few times but that was about it.        I'm secretly pissed about it and fear I will cause an argument if I say anything, lately we have been arguing and I really don't want to start an argument by saying the wrong thing...he is often very sensitive if I don't put things very carefully....      Should I just let it go and let him buy me something in a few days or say something to him about it?

Found out she was fired from " yet ,another job" on our 1 year anniversary.       I resigned from my sales job 2 weeks earlier because I wasn't making enough money to pay the bills, so I took another job making " 3 " times less  to try and stay on top of things.       I'm working 50 + hours a week but hey you gotta do what you gotta do.      We have no kids in the house, both of us  in our 40's. 2 cars paid for, computers in the home and she doesn't even try to find a job.       I have explained to her that I'm having trouble paying the bills so what does she do? She starts " babysitting " her girlfriend's daughters children  so as she put it "I can have a little money for myself to spend ".       So I ask, you're getting $75 a week for babysitting 5-7 hours , 3-5 days a week, when are you going to have time to find a job because I can't do all this myself? That question turns into an argument.      So we get invited to he girlfriend's boyfriend's Valentines Day couple get- together and guess what? She tells me ( the day of ) that she forgot that I didn't have to work " that day " and had agreed to "babysit" her girlfriend's daughter's kids? On Valentines Day ?       But, her girlfriend was there at the boyfriend's house with the other couples.      My wife decided to babysit so the girlfriends daughter and her boyfriend could go out to dinner. Meanwhile, I'm the only person at the get-together with " no wife ". After a couple of hours , I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable so I decide to leave but, I'm ask to stay a bit longer and just wait for my wife to arrive. She finally does arrive at about 11:30 pm just as I'm ready to go.      I don't know what's going on guys so, maybe the ladies can help me understand what's really going on here...

20090219225254AAnxMnF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this because of something I'm doing?  Or is it just the way girls are right now?	In my first year and a half at college 7/8 of my closest friends are girls. I had a crush on one of them for a long time, I told her about it, and she basically said she doesn't really see me that way, but she still hangs out with me all the time and we go to lunch/parties together all the time. Another one of my friends told me that I was the nicest guy she knows, and that it isn't a bad thing, but agreed with my first friend and said that she doesn't know why but she just never viewed me as someone to date, just a good friend.      I'm kind of confused now. I'm not unattractive, I'm in great shape, I am musically talented... but I'm not a big partier, and I don't do drugs/sleep around.  Every girl I meet instantly seems to put me in the 'friend zone', and it's starting to get depressing.      Is it something I'm doing? Is it just the college mindset to only be friends with nice guys?

20080319095048AALxqyo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I REALLY like her!?	i REALLY like her, but she's not interested in me. I know this cuz she sent me a text back in december. I thought I could get over her, but I can't. a friend of mine says he doesn't find her attractive (I didn't get mad, we have our separate opinions.) but i think she's beautiful. i'll admit it myself she has some extra weight on her, but she more than makes up for it with her personality, and she has flaws, just as I do. she has these GORGEOUS eyes and a great smile. I know if she gave me ONE date, I'd be able to get a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and then we'd be a couple. She's really sweet and doesn't like to drink-party, (btw, we're in college) Like i said, she sent me a text in dec. saying she's not interested. well that was over 3 months ago and I'm still interested and I can't get over her. What should I do?

20070917165647AAwhUsD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Eres celoso (a) ??	 http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=4j7fH0K0OC...    Los celos son una de las emociones naturales en nuestra sociedad, como el odio o el amor, pero los éstos pueden poseer rasgos negativos como positivos. Debido a que se tiende a percibir a los celos normales como una muestra de afecto por parte de la persona amada, una justa cantidad de celos sería necesaria. Sin embargo, si en una pareja los celos son permanentes, éstos tienden a desgastar y perturbar la relación afectiva, porque surge el reproche, el reclamo, la exigencia de incondicionalidad hacia el ser querido.      Como parte de la vida amorosa de todos los individuos, los celos son sentimientos que provocan tanto goce como sufrimiento. Barthes, un reconocido semiótico francés, observa que como celosos padecemos cuatro veces:      Por celosos.   Por reprocharnos estar.   Por temer que nuestros celos hieran al otro.   Por dejarnos someter a una nadería.    En el matrimonio, por ejemplo, este tipo de celos es útil, porque actúa como generador de energía vital en la pareja. Cada uno se esfuerza en mejorar para mantener encendida la llama del amor.      Los celos, como una reacción de alerta ante un bajón amoroso de cualquier miembro de la pareja, son saludables y constructivos.      Otro caso de celos positivos aparece en las personas mayores, en las que actúan como estimulantes favorables del amor. Muchas veces es como una especie de chispa energética que hasta se vuelca en otras actividades productivas, las que por a?os habían pasado desapercibidas.      Es muy común que se interpreten los celos como expresión de la importancia que tiene un individuo para esa persona. En las parejas recién formadas, uno de los índices para verificar si la otra persona está realmente interesada es la demostración de celos. Es así que la aparición de celos por parte de uno de los miembros de la pareja le hace saber al otro sobre sus sentimientos recíprocos y son concebidos como halagadores.

20090219223006AAH0c33	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Soon to be mother in law MAJOR problems...?	My fiance and I decided on a January 1, 2010 wedding recently. We told his mother about it yesterday and she basically flipped out. She said that was a horrible day, and that it will never be "our day" because it will always be New Years Day. I don't see New Years Day as a huge holiday.. I see New Years Eve as somewhat of a holiday, but I wouldn't compare it to Christmas or anything...      But, she called my fiance today and told him she didn't want anything to do with the wedding. She said not to call her or talk to her again, and she didn't care what we do since we didn't take her feelings into consideration. We did take hers into consideration, we just went with what we wanted.. She wanted a summer church-religious wedding, and we are not religious.. We like the scenery of winter and it works good with our school schedules and my fiance will be on a school practicum over the summer. It was very convenient for us..      So what do we do now?? She's not happy and my fiance isn't happy.. Right now he doesn't want her to be at the wedding since she wants no part in it and doesn't even want to talk to him about anything..      Any ideas?? I'm lost..

She's not sexually active (yet) but I really don't want her to have a baby yet!  She's all "But it would be so fun" and "I would look after it".  i'm telling her no, it is not a good idea.  I personaaly am waiting until marriage to even consider having a baby, but she wants one now.  Any tips on convincing her otherwise?      i've told her this   -it's not easy   -it's financially draining   -it's not like you can pass them off, or turn them off when you don't want to deal with them   -it's not a three day thing.  It's all the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week (she had the robot baby for three days)   -there is so much resposibility, and your life is ahead of you. Wait until you are out of school and college if you're planning that   -settle down and be financially stable first         Please help me convince her not to get pregnant!

In the LNDNS Group (it stands for our names), I have known the "L" since i was a junior, the "N" when i was a junior, the "D" when i was a sophomore, the "N" is me, and the "S" since i was a sophomore. But the L and the S are moving before senior year. I already have the S's phone #, and I know the "L"'s number. But one day, I called the L to see if we could hang Saturday and just go to the cafe and hang at my house for awhile, and maybe she could sleep over. But I was so heartbroken b/c the number was disconnected. I called the D and she searched Whitepages.com and it said that she moved. We were going to make plans and I promised her id hang with her for the entire summer, party after party and just have some BFF time since we wouldnt be together 4 senior year. I was so upset she left, and the other N would be more upset when we call her when she gets back from NYC. And the S will be very shocked when i tell her. The D and me and already shocked ourselves. she wont evn check her mail

20090219222233AAfqUCR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something wrong with you if you hate being single?	Well that sounds like a dumb question =)   But I mean if you really hate it and it' ruining your whole life. It didn't start bothering me until about 4 1/2 yrs ago. I started off being really sad/alone and then I didn't want to do anything, I mean I have no passion for anything. And then I lost my self-esteem and now it's so bad I want to die...   But I won't like commit suicide that's totally selfish and it'll ruin all chances of ever getting someone cuz it would be kinda hard to date from the grave.   So I pretty much feel trapped. There seems like there's no way out except getting a bf but that probably isn't going to happen.    How could I be happy on my own? I stay busy but it aways comes back.   My buds say I should get help from like a parent or somene but I really don't think they would understand (whenever I talk to someoen they think I'm being desparate and they don't get the point that it huts so bad I want to die) I'm also scared to death of telling them. I suck at emotions and self-expression and all that nonsense and i don't want a shrink to put me on some weird medicine.   I think this is totally odd because i think im perfectly capable of being on my own but this makes me so sad. Do u think it's a chemical thing, like an addiction? Sadly, I think about having a bf all the time and whenever I see like a couple on tv (because I dont ever see them in realife) I just burts into tears. Honestly. An it hurts physically, like really bad so could it lead to health problems or is that just in my head?      Ok I'll shut up now. I apologize for any mistakes but you must know that I am writing this at almost 2am

20090219221940AAgrXys	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need roommate advice...?	I currently live with my fiance and a friend of ours. I am the one in charge of paying the bills, and I don't ever have any issues getting the money from them. We all get along great, and share food and the television just fine. My only problem is that neither of them wants to clean up the house.       We live in a two bedroom apartment, which is crowded enough as it is. Having extra clutter and mess just makes the apartment seem smaller. My fiance will clean up his own mess and his mess only. This seems fair, but he doesn't consider things like vacuuming and sweeping and taking out the trash his job. Our roommate came from a home where "her mom vacuumed every day" and her mom did all of her laundry and chores. My issue is not how her room looks, but how the common areas are. I work 40 hours a week, have 4 classes with about 10 hours a week of homework, and work a volunteer job one day a week. I don't feel that it's fair that I should have to come home and do all the work cleaning the house. I'm not sure how I should approach this subject. I don't want to come off as demanding or rude, but I feel that I am getting the short end of the stick here.       Any advice would be appreciated.

20090219220736AA3iPM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with my girlfriend over this?	My girlfriend's been going through a hard time with her family life. We've been dating for almost seven months now, long-distance relationship, and she's been keeping a lot of secrets from me. Example of such secrets would be her mother throwing away my dead sister's charm that I gave to her mother for emotional support. I know that sounds confusing, but the pendant meant a lot to me and I gave it to her mother to show how much I cared about not just my girlfriend, but her mother, too. The mother now hates me for some reason... I'm not quite sure why. My girlfriend and I have never had sex or even come close to it and I've given her mother money to help with groceries when I didn't even have money either--and then her mother just throws away my sister's pendant? On top of that, my girlfriend decided not to tell me. She kept this a secret and I'm really hurt. She won't confront her mom about it and I feel betrayed. What should I do? Break-up with her? Or try and work something out?

20090219222041AAnicXw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Immigrant married REAL boyfriend. Relationship was great before marriage, but is now his SLAVE! Need advice!?	We were in love, and had been together for a good while, but the immigration issue I had put a lot of the responsibilities on his hands (i.e. making money & paying for bills, driving the both of us everywhere because I wasn't able to obtain a driver's license). If I may add, I was brought out here as a child, and I truly feel American at heart. So, he married me and I was psyched about finally being able to do my part in the relationship.       However, a few weeks after our marriage, he began to change his attitude towards me and acting as though I am in debt with him and, in a way, made me feel like his SLAVE. I mean, he doesn't hurt me physically, but he does so emotionally. I admit that if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be in college, and making a decent salary, I feel that I am deprived of the love that I truly deserve as his WIFE. I am thankful of him, but the relationship has suffered since this marriage. I did not marry to use him, and I love this man with all my heart, but I am beginning to believe that you really can't have it ALL.       We had been married for a year now, and he ignored all the holidays that passed, saying that because of what "he did for me," he owes me nothing more. Valentine's Day left me feeeling worthless and depressed. IS THERE ANYTHING I COULD DO TO RESTORE OUR OLD RELATIONSHIP? I need some advice.

My boyfriend of one year and a half broke up with me over some drama basically i did a mistake and he believe other people over me.I do still care for him and wonder if he will ever look for me again.We have been broken up for a month and i am doing my best to move on keeping my mind busy just working on myself.Truth is our relationship wasn't the same even the sex.He is prideful-when we would argue guess who would be the one calling or showing up me.I know now he wont if he bearley did call before unless we werent fighting.I know he does care for me because it was over a year it's logical but i was wondering if this has ever happened to you.You were in a relationship for over a year or more he broke it off with you and you were heartbroken and had to move on and he contacted you after being a complete jerk.I haven't called him i tried once but he was an ashole.This is progress for me and i actually am doing ok without him.Just need to hear any other relationship story that sound's similar and he cameback out of the blue when you gave up hope he would ever      I am 24 and he is 28 this is goes more to people around my age-Thank You.

20090219221425AAIfoVG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MEN::::::::::::: Friend-Lationship question?	We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I dont feel like he's using me for anything, I just feel like he does certain things because he feels he owes me...which is just as bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"   The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???
20090219225420AAMowe9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I Do Something Wrong?	Ok. So i've been friends with this guy for years, and his best friend for about one year. We are extremely close and are comfortable with each other. Did I mention he is was my first boyfriend? yep, its one of those. So, he knows I'm in love with him and what not...but he doesn't feel 100% that way ( also, he doesn't want a relationship since he is being deployed next yr.) So, we ended up having sex a few weeks ago and it was nice, no weirdness. We talked and everything as usual. Lately..I haven't heard from him, he doesn't call as often as he used to. I don't understand why? I mean, we understand each other perfectly and trust each other...so why all of a sudden the shady act? Not to sound creepy or anything, but I checked his email and he's doing some kind of speed dating thing; he's determined to find "the one", but why cut me off?

I have a friend's birthday tomorrow night. She's been planning it for 2 months. First I was thinking okay fine I will go, but then she decided to bring her two friends and her boyfriend. Now I really don't want to go anymore because I don't know them. I'm not good around new people, and she's gonna be busy with them anyway, so what's the point of going when I didn't even want to in the first place? I know that makes me sound like a terrible person, but I'm just not an outgoing person like her. I prefer to stay at home with my family and spend time with them.

I kinda got feelings for her when i first started hanging out with her but i didnt want it so ignored it and it went away.      she lives with me, we're basically together.      yes i want to be with her, but it just doesnt feel the same as the last girl i liked,      i dont know how i feel about this one,all im sure about is that i care about her sooooooo much and i love to hug her and i think maybe i want there to be love but i dunno if it is, or is it love and ive just grown up and we're so close we just feel like the best of pals and we're allready there,      why does no girl feel like the last one.      is love just a different feeling with different people.      I can be myself around her and i dont get nervous or anything.            idk is this right or wrong..... im so confused... i d k wat to do.      id be happy if we stayed close friends, but id hate to hurt her,  :( i dont know... is this love or is it just some big tease.

Whenever she stops by lately, the first thing out of her mouth is, "Feed me, I'm starving, I didn't eat anything before I left my house!" At first I had no problems with this, after all she was a guest. Especially if she was going to be at my house for several hours, of course I would give her something to eat. But now it has become a pretty regular thing that every time she comes to my house, even if she is merely stopping in the driveway to pick me up, she asks me to feed her because she is "so hungry." She is very overweight so it is clear that she IS eating. I'm just getting tired of being asked every single time. What should I do? She even asks for snacks to "tide her over" when we are on our way out to a restaurant!

20090219223243AAd2kRr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this considered "attractive" anymore (shortened because I want this to get read)?	I don't know how much women care about this sort of thing but I've been told by multiple people I'm a pretty talented 18 year old... which while attempting to stay within the realms of modesty I would have to agree with... however the talents in question aren't exactly of the cookie cutter teen variety... I don't play sports anymore so I'm not a jock football hero and I don't exactly look like Brad Pitt or whoever you people think is hot today (not UGLY though just not a complete stud)... What I do have a considerable amount of ability in is in the area of more artsy endeavors... I have been told my singing is beautiful and has actually been mistaken for a pro recording before... again though this isn't the pop vocal stuff... I did a lot of theater up until recently and got some big roles... the other area I have been told I have talent in is writing poetry... I will include a poem I wrote not too long ago at the end of this question... So I guess what I am trying to ask is does anyone in the realm of 16-20 years old find that kind of thing attractive anymore... If ever?       http://tempforquestion.tumblr.com/  My poem I mentioned...
20090219223622AAVlPdb	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I fix a broken friendship?	My friends and I are in a fight. I am on my side and they are on theirs. I feel guilty of what I said and I already apologized! They said ok and went right back to ignoring me. How do I mend this?
20090219223455AAhW0Nd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How come women don't like me?	Ok, I am 24 single in college getting my masters degree, I have been on several dates like dinner and a movies, but only had one girlfriend which lasted for six months, she cheated on me. I am slim, and 6ft 4in tall. And I don't get why women won't take it beyond just a dinner and a movie date. I am smart, kinda quiet, but can hold a conversation. What is it with me? Am I not bad enough or something?

20090219224111AAcEy4o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When will I get over her?	So me and this girl dated for a couple months. I'm 18 and a senior and she was my first "relationship" but she decided that she wanted to just drop it and be friends after acting weird for a couple of weeks. So now we still see each other, but not nearly as much and it really makes me sad. I liked her a lot, and she told me that she liked me but thought it would be unfair to "take me along on a ride that would go nowhere" now we are just sort of distant friends. I miss her though, I can't stop thinking about where I went wrong. I want things to be the way they used to be. I know most of you are going to say "in time" but I just feel like I've been robbed. Thanks a bunch everybody.
20090219224212AAAfZGC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is up with an old love?	Years ago...maybe around 4, I dated this guy and we seemed to had just fallen in love...but he was really a big workaholic and it strained us and we parted, his idea. We stayed friends...I moved on and so did he. I have an amazing boyfriend and my old guy is married now. Thing is...4 years later...I get text or messages from him...talking about how he had a dream of me and he does all the time...and they are normally something sexual. We live far apart and I haven't seen him in 3 years...but he always text things that he shouldn't be...for one I have a man that I love and secondly, he is married...and newly married, maybe only a few months. What's his deal??? Why is he like this?? Anyone have any ideas?
20090219224218AAAtLHw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get his attention back?? ugh...?	so i like a boy that:      is a yr younger than me.   we knew each other in highschool and he asked me out twice but i refused VERY meanly.   who no longer thinks im a "nice girl" bc of my past relationship habits (he still stayed friends with me thru HS-he was  a saint i know lol   who made sure to stay in touch even while we went to different colleges   but then last semester i said some ugly things to him about how i'd rather be alone than to be friends with him and our other best friends when i was upset at other ppl. (displaced anger i guess)   and then he stopped talking to me altogether.   now i tried to talk to him again and clearly told him i loved him as a friend (its a start right) and he told me i must have mistakenly messaged him (he added a smile face at the end) (bc it was on Facebook) that post.            sooooo basically....3 years later and im ready to be with him lol   ive matured a little i guess.      hes metro and smart, and sensitive. also apparently no longer that forgiving. opinions ppl?

20090219224609AANIJzO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please tell me if I'm right... its about my ex bf and his problems?	To start off with, we have been dating for 17 months and living with each other for 10 months. We met in college and I came here knowing no one and he was already from this town. We started dating and I had no idea what world of warcraft was till I met him. He would play in his dorm room with his roommate for hours at a time while I would just sit there and watch tv or did homework. The reason why I was so committed to him was because my bf before him was very protective and controlling. So meeting this nice, laid back, guy was a new, exciting thing for me. I think the reason why I have stayed with him this long is because I didn't make any friends in this town or college and I hate being alone. I have become this person I completely hate and notice I'm depressed. I did gain 30lbs, but now have lost 15lbs simply cause I woke up one day and realize I need to live my own life and be who I am, regardless of what my situation is like right now. Our lease for our apartment ends in April and I broke up with my ex about two months ago. Since then I must say I have got a grip on my life, (including the weight loss) and being more social. But, we still live in the same apartment till April. He acts so shocked about the person I've transformed into (which is the old, outgoing me) and tries to make me feel like I HAVE to be with him.         Background info:   -he is crazy addicted to World of Warcraft   -very addicted to porn and masturbating (which i think is disgusting and unnecessary)   -he isnt the type to socialize with new people   -he takes no responsibilty (clean house, occasionally make me dinner)   -his mother does EVERYTHING for him (laundry, gas, money, grocery)   -his dad is the most negative person in the world and RUDE!! and spends 5 or 6 hrs on the computer playing games as well.   -he is more sensitive than I am      with that being said, he expects me to clean our apartment, do laundry, keep up with his classes, make dinner and overall take care of him because his mother has babied him his entire life.      I grew up in an independent and moral based environment, including cleaning up after myself and taking responsiblily.       Please tell me that I'm doing the right thing because my ex bf insist that I'm being ignorant and throwing something good away..

20090219225606AADCsZE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My problem with "The Secret"?	One of the most important steps of creative visualization is that you are supposed to visualize what you want. I have no idea what I want! I feel soo uninspired. I do have many interests. I think I want certain things so often and then loose interest quickly. Im afraid it's depression. Whenever I try to decide on what I want I get tired or frustrated. Nothing seems worth putting in the energy required. My mental and physical health is at stake. Im loosing weight. Negative thoughts control me. I guess what Im asking is how do you cope with these negative feelings? Any insight from anyone would be soo wonderful and thankyou for anyone who takes the time to read my cry for help.
20060704151429AAz6QOj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am about to have sex to show my mom I am not as ugly as she thinks I am?	She calls me names, says that I am not normal, tell me she wants a daughter to look like a model not like me. She regrets giving me birth. However I receive compliments in the strret from guys. I do not understand why she tries to put my self steem down instead of marally supporting me. One day I told her one of my co-workers was harrasing me and she told me it is because I am fat.      I feel so terrible and I know that if I hook up with a guy it will be purely physical. But I do not mind as long as I receive some of that fake love I need. In the other hand I want my first time to be something special. What should I do?

She dreads going every morning, she smokes while she is there (whereas she doesn't usually), she feels sick, has headaches and has lost all self-esteem. She doesn't go out with her friends as much as she used to. I think its really not healthy.      She feels she doesn't 'fit in' there. The teachers sound like dictators. Its rediculous that she pays for such an experience.      I've assured her that there is only a few months to go and it will go quick and she will be proud of herself when she finishes, what else can I do to make it easier on her?

I know that girls are better at appreciating more than just physical appearance.  most guys however wont even give girls a chance if they dont fit that skinny, and pretty profile.  of coarse there are exceptions to this rule like any other, but for the most part its the way it is.      Are we evil, shallow, narrow minded creatures, or is that just natures way?

20070825160521AA4ObkN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Coincidence or signs?	Well, I have a friend and I like him.....allot.   What's funny is that He e-mailed me once when I was in the middle of a romance scene. But that was only the begginning. it happened again while I was writing another romance scene. The problem is that I rareley write romance scenes and he's usually busy and doesn't e-mail much. Also, while we were IMing(google talk), he wrote '<3' and then said his hand slipped and he ment to write ':D'. The problem is that the :D smiley is two rows on top of the <3 smiley, so unless his hand slipped dramatically, then it wasn't an accident. If his hand *did* in fact slip, it wasn't a coincidence, but a sign.    He has a gf, but we're really really close. I can't tell if he likes me or not. He's given signs before, but he always denies liking me. Help!!! Also, I've recently moved to another state, so though we're not close(in distance) we're still close in heart.

20070918164401AAtu2XX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am confused...?	My Boyfriend is really wonderful. Treats me right and we have no problems. But, our communication has lessened more and more as we have been together. We have been together for 6 months now, and he used to call me every day, and used to text me more than once a day. As time has gone on though I'm lucky to get a phone call during the week, and half of my text messages get answered.  We do see each other alot. Could that be it?   (I'm no crazy texter I message him maybe once a day)   I know he has a terrible stressful job and it keeps him busy, (he is a professor) but, what I want to know is...   Is it just that he is comfortable in our relationship and he doesn't feel the need to text or call me every day?   I have asked him before if he could communicate with me more often and he says he will but, then never does.   I'm not worried about other girls or him cheating.  He's not like that.     Is it possible to be comfortable enough not to contact as much?   Any NICE help will be much appreciate

20071002092406AAGd9zp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Like My Friend's Brother?	So I like my friend's brother and I finally told her yesterday!   I can't even begin to explain her reaction. All I'll say is she flipped. Like Front and Backwards. And kept asking me how and why.   I can't say, "Because things happen for a reason." Because I am afraid she will get mad at me.    Anyway.   I really like him a lot. And sometimes I think he may like me back. But first off. I think she is still weirded out about me liking him so I won't mention I really want to go out with him. And Second I don't htink she would want us to. Because if we did go out then broke up it would be hard me to come back to her house after that.      I can tell she is dissapointed in me by liking her brother. I think she is sad also. But I don't know what to do.       Stop liking him and save our friendship.   Or   Keep liking him and see where it ends me up.      I really appreciate all advice given to me.   And if you have something rude to say. BRING IT!   Because I can take it today!      Thanks.       <3 Krissi.

20071014174352AAjVBc7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me?	Well, I am 18 years old and am currently in college. On Thursday nights, i have a phsycology night class, where i have to stay from 6 to 9. The rows of seats are split down the middle and i sit in the back on the right side of the room. On the left side of the room on the back row is this girl that I think is pretty hot. I've never really spoken to her or anything, but during class i'll kinda look over at her and she'll be looking at a book or taking notes, then i'll look back at the teacher. Well, a few minutes later, i'll look over at her again, and she will be looking at me, then jerk her head back towards the front, kinda like everyone did in 5th grade, haha. And i have to admit, she has caught me looking at her a few times as well. But my question is, does she like me, or just looking at me wondering "Why is this creepy guy looking at me?" And if she does like me, what do i do?

She's Chinese, I say that streetgirl and slut is the same thing. She thinks "not all of them are bad" and that they have a good reason, such as dying parents. My belief is that most parents would rather die than have their daughter having sex with strange men for money. Somehow, my girlfriend thinks I am a horrible person for this, and is very angry. Anyways, I asked if she had to do that before, because she was so offended by my comments, she says she wants to break up because she can't believe I said that. Was I wrong?

20071201164632AAsH5xO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Signs he likes you?	I went on a date with this guy that I really like, But I don't know how to tell if he was flirting or showing me signs he was interested. I have a few examples of things he did last night.....      We went to a hockey game, every time he wanted to talk to me he pulled me close (and it wasn't loud everytime he did)  and when he put his arm around me, he would run his fingers along my back so I knew he was his arm around me.       We went to dinner after and we could have sat down right away, but instead we waited 20 minutes for a booth. And his leg kept hitting mine under the table.       Then we watched a movie at his friends house (we went on a double date) and he kept falling asleep so I would teasingly wake him up....Then he would teasingly push me back and say he needed just ten minutes (it was our first date, so we didn't kiss, but he did give me a hug at the door)      Any tips on these examples or even what to do at this point would be helpful.
20080126082135AAiDehc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still be her friend if I am in love with her and there is no future?	I was in a relationship for abot 1.5yrs. I was in love with her but broke up with her. I tried getting her back but she already moved on. So now, our relationships been done for about 7 months and I still cant stop thinking about her. She made it clear that there was no future and that she was seeing someone else. I love her. She calls me when she has problems and calls me her best friend--- I dont want to lose her, then again i know I kinda have already. I know she is seeing someone and that she may be in love with him.   I live in NY and she just moved last a few months ago to CO. I cant tell my friends how I feel because I was never that guy that let girls get to me, but I am still so in love with her. I cant stop thinking about her and what could have been...Should I continue to be her friend?  Whats the best way to get over her? Thank You
20080126102227AAzGiKj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS - got any good advice?	I've known this girl for two weeks, and I have one class with her. I initiate the conversations after class, so I get her to open up and talk with me for about 1-2 minutes after class....we end up talking at the end of class all the way out into the hallway for about 1-2 minutes. I am handsome, and she sits beside my desk every day. Anytime we talk, I have made her laugh. She genuinely smiles and definitely seems interested when we talk with each other. Also, she always gives me eye contact. Also, I can tell she listens to my conversations when I am talking with other people, although I'm not sure if she does it on purpose or not. When I am talking to the girl in front of her, and I say something funny, the quiet girl that I like will laugh. If I asked her out for coffee, would she say yes? Should I ask her out Monday after class? Does she like me? What are the signs?? And, will the girl assume I want to have her as just a friend, or will she think that I want to date her?

He admits he has a problem and when our disagreements/arguments get bad, he can stop for a few weeks or cut back to only like once a week.. but then it goes back to the way it was... like 4-5 times a week... He's at home, not out at bars or anything. Just drinks by himself... Suggestions??

20090219172534AAE933A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies: Do men get shot down like this?	Ladies: Do men get shot down like this?   On Valentine's day, I was putting my mind off being single. A 28 year old male, it seems like you're judged these days for being single.      Am I right? At the laundromat, there was an ATM machine next door and some woman had trouble walking because one of her flip flops was broken or something, and she just kept walking on it. She was really cute, so I tried to initiate small convo when I was leaving. She had a smile on her face and I just said "Having a little trouble there"....      and she said "Yeah, but I don't have far to walk. Im all set, thanks for asking".       Then I said "Any big plans tonight?" --to see if she had a bf, and maybe I worded it wrong, but I asked it innocently, not like I was looking for anything......then there was a pause, looking like she was distracted but I kept walking and she was like ".....yeah". Then I walked into the laundramat and said politely "Happy Valentine's"      Im not going to judge here, but it seems like I certainly was. Im not a 67 year old child molester, any reason Im percieving being talked to like I was?       Is there anything wrong with what I did? Honestly!

Please just tell me what you think.      So im sorta seeing this boy. Whom isnt too good at keeping his promises (like when he says we will hang out he ends up not showing up). This boy btw is 22. Anyways he hasnt been treating me too nicely. And to the advice of Y/Answers i talked to him about it. He said he will treat me nicer now. That was on Tue (night). And yesterday he really did treat me really good. When i texted him he actually answered right away and he never does that. And then that same night though he went drinking (and well when he drinks his true feelings for me come out) anyways he kept texting me all these cute things and then called me. I told him i was worried about him b/c he is drunk and our roads were snowy and icy last night. So he actually called me when he got home to let me know he is ok. So today i texted him b/c we are supposed to hang out tonight and well he didnt respond. That was two hours ago. So is he going back to his old ways already? Oh and do you think he will show up tonight?

20090219172819AAHB7pi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok Guys.... this one's for you. How do we know that......?	Basically what i want to know, is how can us girls tell whether a guy is really interested in us or just flirting with us to have fun. i guess what i want to know is, how can we tell a guy is genuinely interested in us or if he's just a player looking for fun. for instance a guy i know, we talk a little bit and definitely flirt sometimes and he seems to want to get to know me. he asks me questions and tries to be around me a lot. but at the same time i have the feeling that he's interested in a couple of girls. so, if you could please tell me signs that a guy is interested in a girl, and signs that a guy is just looking to have fun with a few girls.

We have both gained a little weight recently and don't look our 100% best.  But we're still attractive.  I just don't feel very good about myself and it's hard for me to get turned on and feel sexy.  When I don't feel sexy, it's really hard for me to enjoy sex with my husband.  I'd appreciate the perspectives of both husbands and wives here.      By the way, I'm not "fat."  We have both gained about 20 pounds since we were married and are simply a little chubbier (which we are both working hard to lose as we speak!).

20090219174644AA0kNpl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What makes a guy rude to one girl, but nice to another?	today in the lunch line, this guy and my friend accidentally bumped into each other and he turned around, and looked at her really mean and said, "DAMN, *****! EXCUSE YOU!" a few minutes later, as we were walking out of the cafeteria, him and i accidentally bumped into each other, and all he said to me was, "excuse me, i didn't mean to run into you like that." which shocked me because i was seriously expecting him to blow up!      i've seen this happen many times with different guys. i dropped all of my books out of my locker one day, and this guy helped me pick them up, but i saw him later on that day being a total jerk to another girl!       and i thought girls were the ones with the mood swings! but dang, teenage boys have a lot of them too! has anyone else had to put up with mood swingy boys before? lol.

Ok well i like thisz guy and he told my friend's GUY friend tht he thought tht i was kinda stalking him (I WASNT NOT EVEN CLOSE) and ya i cant feel mad about him about saying it and i still like him...............      well he's sorta been showing up around school more, i used to only see him @ lunch and one day me and my friends were sitting by a door by the cafeteria and him and a couple friends came and stood at the trash can RIGHT by where we were and i'm pretty sure he knew i was there so i dont think its a coincidence............      Also b4 he said this he acted like he liked me:   1) he looked at me whenever me and my friends went into the cafeteria to get lunch      2) when my friends went up to him and i was too shy to go with them he said "she doesnt seem to really like me," sounding kinda sad.      3) he acted nervous the 2 times he talked.....      So does it sound like he really does like me? Should i add him?

20090219130141AA4Bd4W	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it possible to friends after divorce and possibly get back together?	My husband of a year and a half recently told me that he wants a divorce. We hadn't known each other very long, and our marriage has brought a lot of hardships.I love my husband very much, and I believe that our marriage is worth fighting for, but at this point he doesn't. We will have at least an 18 month separation before he can file because he doesn't want a fault based divorce. He thinks that our friendship will be stronger after he leaves and says that we need to start all over again. He wants to start again like he had never met so that if we have a strong foundation for our relationship. He gets upset when I say that he is walking out on me and that if our marriage fails it is because he refused to try one last time. His dad and many of his friends don't believe that he will actually file for divorce. Most people say that after a few months they think he will come running back and want to work things out. It has been over a month since he told me that he wanted a divorce, but we still share the same bed. He says that he is waiting to have a running vehicle because he wants to be able to go to work on his own schedule instead of someone elses. He wants to have a friendship and hang out even after the divorce. Do you think we can actually have friendship? What is the likelihood that we will reconcile? Please no rude answers...

I'm happy with him and I love him lol...if I'm not happy I'll break up with him.

I am pretty sick with a bad cold, and wanted to go out for warm delicious Vietnamese noodle soup tonight. Plus I landed a new job today (woo-hoo!) and wanted to go out to celebrate (cheaply). I worked late despite my illness and came home around 7:30pm, making this desire for noodle soup known to my husband.       He declared that no, we were just going to eat at home since he forgot to eat lunch for the day and was starving while waiting for me to get back. We then heated up leftovers and I ate in a separate room because I still feel ill from my cold and feel disappointed about the missed soup. My husband saw this and instead of coming over to talk, stormed into the other side of the house. Analysis?

I was infront of him in a line the other day, and he was like 'Hey, I haven't talked to you in forever' and we were talking like we always had.       Is he just a friend, or more?

I dont want anything I feel I havent made any money in 7 years so I am not entitled to anything but if we were to ever get divorced that he takes care of our kids. I am a good wife and mother. I have been w/ him since I was 18 now almost 30 and we didnt marry cause I was preg he asked me to marry him b/c he loved me of course I was 20 when we married. I dont hang out w/ friends have no family no job b/c thats what we agreed on. He makes good money so that allows me to raise our kids not a daycare. I am sorry for all the good men out there who got screwed when divorced but I am not like other women. My husband says I spend all his money if you consider grocery shopping,buying for our kids and etc then yeah but I dont buy for myself he gets mad. So should I take this remark seriosly or is he just kidding b/c I dont want him to stay w/ me just b/c he doesnt want to give me anything if he wants to be like his other married friends and cheat on their wives and live the bachelor life again thats fine but he needs to let me know not hang on to me so he doesnt have to give me anything. As far as I know we are doing good right now not arguing.

We're extremely shy around each other n I know this already sounds bad but i got to know her and started liking her shortly before she got a new boyfriend but by the time i had gotten all her signals this other more confident guy already got in. I know she likes me because of many reasons and atm she's split between us two and i need a way of winning her over by getting her to notice how much attention i give her.   Would not talking to her/talking to her friends instead or something make her realise that I do give her alot of attention and care??

Okay, my mom is like 35 and I am a 16 year old guy. She shows a lot of cleavage in front of my friends. She's attractive and has fairly large boobs. All my friends stare at her cleavage. During the summer, she would just wear like a bra and even when my friends come over. They stare at her. Last week, my friend came over for a sleepover, and she invited her new boyfriend over aswell. We rented a movie but the entire time, they were making out and the guy had his hands inside her shirt, squeezing her boobs... IN FRONT OF MY FRIEND! We were staring at them more than watching the film. The same night, when they went to her room to sleep... you could clearly hear them having sex. It was embarassing.

20090219175842AA40S6p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does this boy even care?	I don't understand this boy.   When he saw my GPA a while ago, (it said 2.6), he got all serious and was like, "You're too smart for this GPA." But then he dropped it when I said I didn't want to go there.   A few days ago, in the stairwell, I was talking to a friend of mine, just babbling about nothing, and I mentioned the 23% I was getting in Science, and he just spun around and was like, "You're getting a 23%?" And I was like, "Yeah, but it's not a big deal. It'd go up if I actually went to class....or did the work....whatever." He got serious againg and was like, "Don't you want to be off to a good start, though?"   And I was like, "Nahh, I managed to pass last semester, I'm sure I'll manage."    Then he seemed to get angry, and said, "You're going to end up going to college with a bunch of dumbasses!" He sounded almost disgusted, and then turned around and left, and we didn't talk for the rest of the day.      The thing is. We only started talking in like...November.    We only became actual friends like...2 months ago, and    we only really clicked (as in I started liking him and he started acting like he might like me back), a few weeks ago, so why would he care?      Oh, and the thing is is that the only reason I have bad grades is because I have really bad apathy, which I think stems from depression, which I am attempting to get treated, but it's not like I can exactly tell him that, so what should I evendo in this situation?

20090219174506AAMbWTb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I leave my husband in prison?	I have been with my husband for over 9 years now. When I first met my husband I had no real idea about his past. He was a ex felon on parole for distributing drugs and also he is a drug user. When I met my husband he was this way. We have 2 children together. My whole story is really long and complicated. But I will do my best.    My husband got me pregnant over 8 years ago. He then left me to go back to prison for selling drugs. I waited for him and moved everywhere he was so he could see his daughter and we could be a family. He was in prison over 4 years. He got out started using drugs again and eventually went back on a parole violation. He got out went back again on a parole vilolation and then had went back another time this would be his 3rd time. During these time's he was out I had to put up with alot of crap. My husband always accuses me of cheating, he constantly degrades me calling me many horrible names that no one should stand for. He would always leave me at home for weekend's and come back and not call or nothing. This has gone on a long long time.   And I am a christian and feel that maybe he will change so I stay with him. I want to know what I should do for me and my children.    I really can't stand waiting for him everytime he goes back to prison. It break's my heart everytime and I get very emotionally depressed. I am finacially drained from not having the support that I need. Should I stay with him (me being a christian) and see if he changes or should I try to move on? I really don't want to be separated and he really don't seem like he want's to change. I have waited now over these 9 years for him going back and forth to prison. I feel cheated.   Another question. He always accuses me of cheating. Could this be a sign that maybe he has done so? Please someone give me some advice. My heart is breaking.

20090219190337AAlQ9mE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would it be the best for me to keep my content and avoid everyone before i move?	i'm moving to Texas this summer.      i just learned that my friends are lying backstabbers and i want to avoid them as possible. i never hang out with these people who were my friends in the past. they're like a random person i say hi to in the halls and that's all or they ignore me. i have a crush on a guy i don't know and doesn't know i exist.       should i not make any friends and avoid everyone til i move? i don't like my friends at all and i know they don't like me as a true friend either, it's not like they hide it. i'm sure i would get a better crush in a larger city who is 1000000x better than this one.      whenever i make friends, i get stuck to them easily and i don't want to feel bad and sad when i move and never see them again. so would it be best for me to avoid everyone and keep my content?

20090219165810AADvhoF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I made some mistakes and want him back. Do I stand a chance?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. This was strange for me since I'm used guys being more aggressive. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that 2 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I just gave up trying to contact him the other day since we have just been going back and forth with this fighting. I want a second chance though. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Im not going to sit around waiting but if I still would like to be with him. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? Should I call him, drop by his house and talk in person???

20090219175503AAu6skh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was i too mean to this guy? (sorry its so long)?	okay so this guy was in my lab group in science since the very first day of school. through then til about mid january. we always joke around and laughed. he always asked if i was his best friend, and i'd say yes. becayse he probb was my best guy friend. even though we never hung out. EVER. so then the second semester started and we didn't really talk as much because we weren't in the same lab groups. we'd talk before and after class. but that was it. then one day after clas he said "can i walk you to your locker" and i said "sure" and as we walked he was like "this is SO embarassing. do you wanna do something this weekend "i swear to god my heart stopped and i said "oh. well. umm. i want to but. can we just be friends.?" and he looked really hurt and said "sure. friends is good" and walked away. he wasn't there the next day so i couldnt talk to him. but the next monday we just talked...but it was kinda awkward. i really only feel bad  because hs said he was EMBARASSED. which means he had to build up a lot of courage. people said "oh your so mean to him" i didn't think the way i turned him down was THAT bad. i mean i have NO FEELINGS for this guy. and. i don't know what to do. help?

20090219184039AA1Tsnh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Aunt's husband said THIS...Why? What could he be planning?	First of all for the last year my Aunt and her husband have been having arguments. He came back from Iraq where he was a translator and make like 90k in a year. When he returned my Aunt had spend most of the money on frivolous things like facials/massages, clothes, jewelry, furniture, shoes, expensive restuarants and things she didn't need at all.      After he came back from Iraq he didn't continue in the Army. He sat at home for months only leaving one weekend every month for drills (He's in the reserve) while my aunt (who is a teacher) worked everyday. Its been a year and he hasn't gotten a job yet. They still argue alot and they don't even sleep in the same room. He told her he wanted a divorce as soon he got a job.      He told her "The Police will be here by the weekend..." Could this mean "Pack your bags I'm putting you out"? Could he really put her out? They have 2 kids together and the house is both their names.

20090219115716AAMXxwL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I over reacting about this?	I posted this on 'singles and dating' and only got answers from young people. I did appreciate their answers but I would love to hear from older people on here. So here it is:   Yesterday I posted a question about mental health. I thought I was depressed or bipolar.I was concerned about my emotions and how its effecting my relationship.  But, last night after I asked my question on here I found some things that made my stomach turn.   We share a cell phone that he leaves home when he goes to class. Yesterday I noticed he took it with him. I had to call my folks in Florida so when he came home I went into his jacket to get the phone. I saw that he added this girl Jackie to his contacts and called her when he was on break at school. They used to mess around for years before we met.   I've been VERY emotional for the past few months, and I couldn't handle the hurt. I'm not the type that confronts guys, esp when I think theyre cheating. I hate the truth, but I also hate lies.   I asked him about him calling the girl. He replied "whats there to talk about?" and then he added "Besides, that wasn't her number anyways, it changed". then he started going on and on making me feel guilty for accusing him of cheating. He later hid the cell in his shoe. I found it only because I moved them. I noticed he deleted all the texts. I'm wondering if they were texting each other .   This morning he thought I wasn't watching him. But he thought he was slick and pretended to pet our cat and he grabbed the cell out of his shoe and stuck it in his hoodie. I asked him again, why is he trying to hid the cell from me. All he said was "How can I hid stuff from you if your always snooping in my things?" (which I don't usually do)   Now, my question is, if he wasn't hiding anything, why would he keep hiding the cell? Esp if we share it. Should I give him the boot? Why would he keep the girl's number on the contact list if it "wasn't the right number'??????????
20090219172341AAEO1TP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is she trying to prove?	The other night, I went on a double "date" with my very old highschool friend and her boyfriend, while I went with my boyfriend.      This was the first time my boyfriend had ever met my friend and her boy.        So we are sitting at dinner, she and her boy sat across from me and my bf.    While we were eatting and chatting I couldn't help notice that she had her hand on his thigh, it was almost like she was squeezing it.   Her boy causally patted her thigh while in converstation but she had a tight grip on his the entire time.       During the conversation I asked how her sister's wedding went and she said "Oh it was nice, very small." then she paused and snarled "Mine is going to be way better."          I was taken a back, firstly she isn't engaged and I thought it was petty.      Then while her boyfriend was talking to my boyfriend, she started to tell me what her boyfriend and her have planned and what he got for her Val day and even so much how expenisve it was.  She seemed smug.      My boyfriend just gave me a home made card made from printer paper and markers.  (He couldn't afford much but it was the thought).         By the end of the night I was really annoyed and I am wondering what she was trying to prove to me?

20090219174857AAtN0lQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I talk to him about our friendship?	My ex broke up with me but was very determined on staying friends. At first I was hurt and told him I'd still always like him and I understand how that could put a strain on things. I still do have feelings, but we were very close as friends before dating and I care about that so much more. He is just so reluctant to be around me and I feel like its probably because he knows I'm going to want more. Should I talk to him and tell him that i miss our friendship and care about him much more in that way?

20090219174809AAbkDcK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Looking for people to interview?	I am a college graduate with a BA in Human Services. I have dedicated a lot of my time to non profit organizations, and work largely with victims of sexual/domestic violence.      As we know, in the past domestic violence was not that uncommon. Statistically, sexual and domestic violence happens less today than it did, and people are more educated, and aware of what is right and wrong.      Incest was also fairly common, and hardly talked about, and is a touchy subject. More people this day in age are coming out with how they were molested as a child by a family member. For example:      A young girl is repeatedly raped by her father, and seen by her father as a "second wife." This causes a tense relationship between the mother and daughter. The father takes advantage of his sons as well, and they act out against their sister. They rape her, hit her, and emotionally abuse her. However these children do not know that its wrong, it is how they are raised.      Years later, the woman is now in her 40s and confronts her brothers about what has happened to her after extensive therapy. One brother says its a lie, and she is crazy. However, the second brother admits to it, but they have no further contact, he apologizes but what else can he really do.      So often we look at the victim, and the person who commited the act of violence. However in this case what about the wife of the brother who admitted what he did. As a wife how would you handle this situation if your husband told you that he hurt his sister while he was younger? He did not know it was bad, he has never hurt anyone else, and it was years ago; it was "more common."      As a wife would you sweep it under the rug, like it never happened? That was years ago and its done and over with? Get a divorce? Get therapy?       I wanted some thoughts and opinions, however also I am looking for any woman/man who privately would like to share their story with a complete stranger. This is for my own knowledge, and education.       Please be respectful to other peoples thoughts, and opinions.

20090219181000AAbltfm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? PLEASE ANSWER?	He's the kinda crazy trouble maker and funny, very outgoing and so on.    So reasons why and why not   He does?   1.) My friends were teasing him that he liked my friend and he said if he did he wouldn't sit next to her, then I sat next to him and he moved.   2.) I asked him if he liked a different friend of mine and he made sure I knew he didn't Ex. "we're not in 2nd grade when I say I don't like someone I don't!"   3.) He makes or pokes fun at almost all the girls except me   He Doesn't?   1.) he has sat next to me   2.) A girl he was rumored to like asked him to sit next to her and he did   3.) He doesn't ask me for help in L/A anymore but if I offer it he will accept.   4.) He's kinda popular and I'm not   So I don't know, and please don't tell me to ask him because when I asked if he liked my friend he said he'd rather kiss a toad, and if he said something that harsh to me I'd be really upset.

20090219170637AAJG194	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: EASIEST question you could EVER answer!! 10 points!!! (Girls may be able to help as well)?	Please read:      Okay, so there's this guy, let's call him Billy, that I think I may like, but I'm not sure because I've never talked to him. So here's the deal:   He comes to my school every other day for math tutoring (he goes to a private school, and i go to public) He also goes to my church!! But my church is big, so it's not like we ever have any contact. (i have church on saturday)   He's a jock type, so I've heard, and he's on his school's basketball team, maybe track too, idk.   So, I DO NOT wanna start a convo with him...But! I've HEARD that he may like me, becausee:   My sis said that when he was coming down for communion during church, he was staring at me.   And one of his old friends who used to go to his private school, but now goes to my school, said that when he was talking to Billy, that Billy saw me walking down the hall, and asked the other guy for my number! (then the other guy told me at dismissal that Billy said that)      Oh and btw, I'm in 7th grade (so is he), I play field hockey and volleyball, and play the oboe in band. (but i can also play flute)   i'm smart, but deff not a nerd or weird person like that.   i'm not like, top notch popular, like hollister and uggs, but i'm not shy.      So here's my question(s):   Guys:      What do you like in a girl? (and please please pleasee tell me what kind of person you are: jock, bandy, orchy, or just plain weird)       If you were in my position, who you would handle this? (again tell me what kind of person you are)      Would you date me based on what you know? (tell me what you are)         Girls:      What should I do?!?!      How would you handle this?                  Thank you soo soo soo much!      Sorry you had to read that novel...   Remember, 10 points!!

I mean I find myself having these fantasies regularly and most I would be embarrassed to tell people out. Most are forbidden type of fantasies that society would look down upon. I think I am somewhat of a normal guy, but these fantasies and desires are still there. Just wanted to know if anyone else had these. Just interested I guess. You don’t have to admit to what yours are if you don’t want, but if you had the courage to go for it. I just wanted to see how many people would be willing to admit to this besides me. If anyone cares to leave there email addy then we could chat about some of are wierd fantasies if you would like. I would preffer not to send them out to the world, but would be willing to share them one on one. Mine is leavemealone230@hotmail.com add me to messenger or email me.

20090112162335AA9sVGh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he likes me, then why does he call her?	This guy who's in my group of friends stares at me, doesn't talk to me a lot when there's others around and teases me a lot, talks a lot if he's dropping me home, remembers everything I say, everything I like, is really sweet to me and does things for me when no one's watching.      The other day I was on fb and my friend (a girl) and I were about to go to the cinema, he came on fb and we chatted - we don't usually. He asked what time the movie started and then found out all the bus timings and calculated the time I'd be home that night and told me all that with no explanation as to why he'd done it. When I asked him, he went silent. Anyway, I don't get him, cuz if our group is doing something or we're going anywhere, he calls my friend or messages her and talks to her a lot when we're all sitting around. And he just keeps looking at me and randomly asking questions that seemed to be aimed at everyone but only I'm the only one who has the answer to them. I don't get it...If he likes me, why does he call her/message her, etc? Or does he like her?      (I live and work with the girl and we pretty much do everything together.)   Any help would be appreciated.

20090219184259AATwZ2y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I CANT love myself, i just cant! help?	people keep saying that for people to accept you you need to love yourself for who you are. i have tried but it just doesnt work for me, i have zits and thats all i can ever see when i look in the mirror. some people pick on me and i get annoyed but i dont really care too much. i think my way of accepting myself nowis just not caring but i dont feel like its working for me. i have tried to come out of my box and be outgoing but people reject me and THAT hurts. i have friends but i also dont trust that they actually like me. i havent had a boyfriend since 8th grade and im a sophmore in high school so, thats not bad but it bugs me seeing happy couples together, i havent had my first kiss yet. i feel like a total loser. any advice on how to accept myself? ive told you though that i just see zits in the morning and i cant see anything else.   thanks for reading. it means a lot

20090219183057AAd2UuK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i text him???	i'm 18 and live in england. on thursdays it's student night in my town and i go out most thursdays with my friends. last week (and the week before!) i got with this guy at a club (i think in amaerica you say 'made out with'). but i was REALLY drunk both times and i think people were kinda shocked and i don't really remember because i was so out of it. also his friends took some pictures of us that ended up on facebook (so embarrassing!)      so this week - tonight (i just got home, its 2am here) i didn't drink much and didn't dance with or kiss him. i said hi a few times but he kept asking why i was being 'off' with him. i didn't really give a straight answer but the truth is i don't want to be seen as a drunken slut.      so i think i did the right thing tonight even though it was really awkward. i don't want him or his mates to think im 'easy'.      but i think he does quite like me and im not sure if i like him or not. i want to text him saying "sorry about tonight. i was just a bit embarassed after last week and those photos :S !! and didn't really know what to do or say. X"      do you think thats ok?      the thing is i do want to meet up with him some time when we aren't surrounded by our friends and completely wasted so i don't want him to think i hate him but at the same time i dont want to lead him on too much. i just wanna see how things go slowly. HELP!! thanks :)

20081110114710AA6IjUP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the best way to ask a guy out?	So, I really really really like this guy.   And I will regret it if I don't at least try.   So I decided I would ask him out.   Anyway.   How should I ask him out?   If I know how to, then I will.   Of course I'm scared but you know.   If I have a "plan" and don't end up just standing there stuttering, it might just help a bit.   Okay, so when? where? We go to school together and we have a couple of classes together. After school, a bunch of us hang out at this place close the school, so I could ask him there too, problem is, he's always around his best friend, they're like inseperable.   Then, what should I say? I mean, I don't think he know i like him, and I don't know if he likes me back, but I'm going to ask him anyway. So do guys prefer "Will you go out with me?" - straight and forward - or something like "Lunch on Saturday?" And if I go for the date option, then should I ask the day before or in advance? I mean when you ask in advance then you have the whole week until saturday and it might be awkward. And I don't really wanna wait that long because I can't stp thinking about him, and I'll regret every minute I wait to ask him out... it's just a thing I do. Because then I'll be like I could have asked him then, or now, or right there. And then I can't concentrate on anything.   Okay, so, when, where, how?   Thanks :)
20081103160237AAKYDdW	Family & Relationships;Friends	My group of friends is breaking apart =( ?	Ok, im going to call my 3 best friends: Clint, Dillon, Aly, and Luke      Well, it all started when 'Clint' decided to make some more friends and stopped hanging out with us, 'Dillon' got kind of upset with 'Clint' and would act angry every time he would come around. Anyways, 'Dillon' has been depressed and has now made a new group of friends as well, though he still hangs out with us.       I know that Aly and Luke will still be there, but Dillon and Clint were my two best friends.. and now I feel like i'm losing both of them. They still talk to me (usually about eachother) but it's not the same...       Well, I know that I should be making new friends because I know the group probably wont stay together much longer, but I really don't want to, do you think there's any way for me to fix our group, or should I really just forget it and try to find new ones..?  (btw, we've all been best friends for around 2 1/2 years)

Alright so, Me and my ex have been together for two years.   Madly in love with one another and compatible as hell. we were like eachothers bestfriends aswell. I did everything for him, I was there for him through tough times, when his friends wernt. He said I was like an Angel sent for him. I supported him financially when he was broke and I stuck through with him for everything. I lost my V to him aswell. He loves me a lot I know. He broke up with me a month ago saying that I lied to him about something, BUT he wont tell me WHAT i lied about? Ive been very faithful to him always. Ive done some things in the past, that hes forgave me for, because he couldnt live without me. He’s done this before, hes said its over for good, but then couple weeks later he comes back. Im broken. I wonder if he will come back around this time? Hes very dependant on me too. Any adivce would help, Im crushed. And I can honestly say, Ive done everything to meet his needs. I supported him every step of the way, I know he crazy about me. But I Just dont understand, Plus he is stressed with ALOT going on in his life right now (court case) But Ive stuck by him for that. You think we will come around to his senses again? .. I wake up in the morning feeling so alone. We always hung out in his house all the time, im sure it drives him crazy with memories. And he also said, hes the happiest guy when hes with me. You think maybe hes just overwhelmed with his court case (might result in possible jail time). I always think of our memories and they kill me, do you think he thinks about them too?... I just can't get myself to stop crying. And he hasn't even blocked me on MSN. Today, after a month I found out he went to sleep with his ex gf.. and possibly back together with her.. Im so HURT, I did absolutly nothing wrong. Will He Regret This?

20090118102026AAIkFcc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What gives with my husband?	I am in my early 50's and married to my husband for 3 years.  We have been together for 11 years.  I am having a difficult time understanding why my husband does not respect my feelings.  We only go to activities , out to eat, family gatherings, etc. when he wants to go and on his time.  When I suggest doing something together, he either does not want to because he has something else he wants to do,says he has no time(too much work to do) or ignores it.  I accept his wishes and do not make a scene. I end up going to alot of things by myself. He does make time to go fishing , hunting, etc. with his friends whenever they beckon, which is ok with me.  I also have a love for fishing, hunting, outdoors, and would like to these things with him. . When I do not feel like participating in a function or have something I need to do at that time, he has very loud, angry outbursts and will not discuss anything with me rationally. He blows his top at me for the littlest things frequently.  Says he does'nt know why he does this.....it's just the way he is.  (the devil made him do it?????)Everything has to be done on his terms or all hell will break loose and then he gives me the cold shoulder for days.  I ask him why he cannot respect my feelings as I respect his and he completely ignores me...sits in front of television and acts as though I am not there.  This has been happening at least twice a month and I am really sad and find myself withdrawing from him.  We have a beautifull home that we built together and have a wonderfull blended family with 6 grandchildren.  I find myself being alone alot (even when he is home)  Thank goodness I have a lot of hobbies to occupy myself.  We both work full time jobs.  My job is left at work at the end of the day...his is brought home with him.  I try to make conversation with him in the evenings and he usually falls asleep, although he can at times be on the phone for hours with his family or co-workers. Lately, it has become a ritual for him to come home from work, eating supper and then falling asleep soon after in his recliner for 3-4 hours.  I go to bed by myself almost every night and he will come to bed in the wee hours of the morning and leave for work before I need to get up.  What gives?  I am not a nagging wife...very even tempered  ( I hate arguing), keep a clean house and keep myself up physically. I am very active, hard working and try to be loving, but it is getting harder to be that way every day.  If this is what the golden years are about........I don't know!?!?  I am starting to think that I should have stayed single.  He is a hardworking man...but sometimes I think he is a workaholic and very hard on himself.    Frustrated
20090214053220AAqmEx2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do? i feel so stuck ...?	i was dating this kid Bailey for two months , but we've known eachother for a year & a half . we broke up 2 weeks ago . i didn't talk to him ONCE until two nights ago when he texted me .. sending it to the "wrong person" . i really like him , a lot & i'm still always going have feelings for him . no matter what .. well while we weren't together he was trying to get with one of my "friends" but she wouldn't. so he was like alright thats fine ... most guys would keep trying . he didn't .      well yesterday i got a random text from him asking me if we could hang out .. i asked "why" and he said because i really want to and then i said well you don't like me you like someone else so .. and he said "no i really like you" .      im kinda guessing this is why he didn't keep trying to get with my friend .. but i really don't know . me & him have been through way way way to much in a short period of time and thats why i wanna be at least friends with him . so many people tried breaking us up . another girl showed up at his house .

20090219104425AAbpVdO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	HOW CAN I GET MY EX BACK?	My ex girlfriend contacts me but it seems that she just want us to be friends.  She still has some stuff at the house we lived for 4 years and she has the keys. She goes sometimes for the mail and takes some of her things and we talk but like friends. There is not that spark.  She changed a lot since the last November. She was a lovely person, believer, and loyal to friends. Now she moved to her friend house and she has problems with her, she doesn’t believe in God anymore, and just want to have fun, get drunk and come to her friend house the next day drunk. She is trying to feel the things we stopped feeling in our relationship. She doesn’t have many friends but I think some guys are taking advantage of the situation. She is European, and since I meet her she was a different person because she was believer and followed the bible. You know that a believer person is conservative which is nice. Anyway, the point is that the root of the break up is “freedom”. She felt that the last year of our relationship was like in prison because we were not doing the crazy things we used to do, we were not feeling the things we felt at the beginning, I was jealous, we didn’t realize we were hurting each other by not putting exciment in our lives.       Now I am trying to get her back, I can forgive everything. I have learned a lot during this time and working on it.  But, I don’t know how to change her negative feelings to positive ones. I think she feels that coming back to me would be coming back to the same, which is taking her freedom.        One of my questions is:  1. Should I take the keys she has from the house and don’t allow her to go there anymore?  Because I feel she can get there any time she wants, but I don’t want to be rude.       2. How can I change to negative feelings of freedom she has for me?

He had a 'girlfriend' earlier in the year but she broke up with him, whenever he hangs out with me (im a girl btw lol) he plays with my hands, bracelets, and hair- but not in a sexual way- whenever he says jokes they're in a way that a girl would say them about a guy and then he looks all embarrassedd cuz he knows every one thinks its a really gay joke. . .

20090219164407AAmQrkS	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need advice on wonderin if i should tell him i like him?	I need advice on wonderin if i should tell him i like him?   ok, this is my story (sorry if its long)      a month ago today i met this guy (lets call him bob) in an aim chat room and everyday after that he would im me as soon as he got online and we would talk until he got offline. and slowly but surely i fell for him. and i fell hard. we have a GREAT friendship and i really wanna tell him that i have feelings. but there's 3 things in my way. 1. he lives in VA (i'm in nj) 2. i'm scared if he doesn't feel the same way it will mess up our friendship. and 3. i don't want my heart broken again. (thats never fun). well sometimes i feel like he does like be back because of the things he says, like once he told me he was thinkin bout me, then said jk (he says jk more than the average person, so idk wat to believe lol) and he told me how he thinks i'm mad cool, laid back, someone who i wouldn't mind hangin out with if u lived around the way (his exact words) then he says oh yea ur a cutie to. and yesterday we were jokin around sayin how we were goin to the bahamas together lol. we have a great friendship. i have been in a long distance relationship before and it didn't work out, only cuz the guy didn't feel the same way.      so pretty much wat i'm askin is do u think i should tell him how i feel? even if it may risk our friendship.

He doesn't know about yahoo answers yet, I'm just asking for advice for him. My brother is 15 years old and he told me he has a crush but this time it's different. This times, it's on a GUY. He used to have crushes on girls. He asked me if he should tell his crush he likes him or not. He's afraid that his crush won't be his friend anymore. I asked him how their friendship is and he told me that they're just friends who help each other. They've known each other since 7th grade. He told me he had this crush since before 2nd semester this year (he's in 10th grade now)         I had advice for my crushes and they told me to keep my feelings and be friends with my crush for a while until my crush opens up to me. Either or not my crush will like me back, i shouldn't keep my hopes up.        what do you think i should do with my brother? i have no problem if he's gay or bi. but he's worried about not carrying the family name to the next generation and how my parents feel. personally, i think they'll be a bit heartbroken but they wouldn't want my brother to be unhappy, IF he really is gay or bi (but now he shouldn't rush things since he's still young.)       here's a photo of his crush i took when i was on a field trip with my brother when he was in 7th grade (on the right). i know it's blurry but i don't have anymore pictures of him:    http://i186.photobucket.com/albums/x36/T...       thank you for helping

20090219170622AADlEz4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Co-worker issue...beyond confusing?	Okay so I am 19 and work as a receptionist in a real estate office. There's one realtor that stands out to me. We joke around and flirt at work. There's a couple problems...he's 20 years older than me. I know the answer to my issue must be obvious, but its not. We constantly make puns at each other and the flirtation grows as weeks go by. We almost kissed today at work and the worst part is that he's married with children, 3 to be exact. His marriage is on the brink of divorce and this isn't because of me, its been going on for a while. The only thing that I have an issue with is the fact that I don't know how to handle this situation. The flirting is strictly between us, no one knows about this at the office and I am seriously not sure what he's thinking. He acts like a total dweeb and then has this sweet caring side to him aswell. He helps me a little financially but for little things that I can handle but he pays for me anyway. So anyone just give me an idea to this, what should I do? Im not falling for him, but a part of me is really attracted to him.

20090219173437AAB5mze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people like kissing?	I have been told I am a good kisser so that's out of the question. My girlfriend isn't all that good at it however and that might be the problem (she kisses like a little kid) It was cute but I quickly became aware that she cant even kiss good normally so shes stuck with it I so pose. Personally I hate kissing, what good do you get out of it, I don't even find it the least bit pleasureful. Most of the time their lips feel like rubber or smooth skin. And if the other person isn't all that great at kissing that just makes it that much worse of an experience. My question is what can you possibly get out of kissing when you really think about it.

20090219173810AAw9ZjA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm ready to have sex with my boyfriend. How do i tell him?	We've been together for almost 2 years. He said we don't have to have sex till i'm ready, even if that means we don't have sex for ten years. Though i'm ready now. But, I don't know how to tell my boyfriend i'm ready to have sex now...   Should i tell him i'm ready to have sex now or wait till we're together and then bring it up?   Or do you have any other ideas of how i should handle this situation?

20090219174521AACqpWE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GF and texting...or lack thereof?	For the guys out there, or girls if it relates to you: Does your gf tend to go through periods where she wont text you at much at all? Like a couple days where texting will be at an all time low? I'm not super needy, and I understand that we both have lives, I just find it strange. Whenever this happens, I usually don't text that much myself, because I just think she's too busy or whatever.       I know it's weird...but it happened last month around the same time...could it just be that time of the month? haha      Thanks for any responses.

20090219175255AAX1QB1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why won't this guy talk to me?	Alright, well, there is this one guy who I was starting to develop a friendship with. It was still in those beginning stages but he would greet me, hug, or call me over to him in the halls whenever he saw me. We exchanged phone numbers after a while and we were texting. He asked if I had a boyfriend and I said that I did (Still do) and he was incessant on knowing who it was. After I told him all of this, he stopped texting me and now he won't even say a simple hello to me or anything. The one time I greeted him first it was nothing like before and he seemed a bit more distant/cold. Could anyone help me out here?

20090219181042AAmVr6l	Family & Relationships;Friends	A guy needs your help girls.?	Well i am an uni student and i was good friends with 2 girls about 1 year back. Lets call them A and B. They are both flatmates and are also good friends. About 1 year back i told B that I liked A more than a friend. She kept this as a secret. Now 1 year later A and I are NO longer friends. Thanks to a series of misunderstandings.    Now lol i like B. The thing is that B was and is a better person than A. All my friends wanted me to be with B. Since i have stopped talking to A it has not affected my friendship at all with B.   B and i joke around a lot and love spending time with each other. We have even joked that we could get married in about 10 years if we find no one. lol   Anyways do u think that B and I COULD be a couple. I mean is it possible that B will not go out with me because i used to like her friend?   If i do have a chance then how can i turn this great friendship into a something possibly more?   We have spent a lot of time alone with each other. We have been on a few meals alone and have spent a lot of time together alone.   I have met her brother and parents on separate occasions and they seemed to like me. Apparently she talks a lot about me with her parents.      btw none thing ever happened between me and A      and apart from talking to her about it what steps can i take to turn a friend into a gf?      also would a girl go out on meals alone with a very good male friend or would she only do that if she had feelings for the guy? I am asking this because in the last few months B and I have been on several meals together. I have also made a couple of meals for her and in a few days when we are both free i am making her another one lol.

So we barely see each other in person because of our busy schedules and different schools. My "crush" and I always text each other, and he would always compliment me, flirt big time, and "lead me on" that he wanted a relationship. I didn't change anything from what I was doing or saying, but now he won't talk to me. If he does all he says is "haha" or "yeah". I have started to ask him him if he actually wants to talk, and he said he wants to talk, and he cares.

20090219190007AATPqGQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He broke up with me because his mother didn't want him to have a girlfriend?	Please help me with this issue, it's been all I can think about for the past few days.      I'm 13 and last month I got asked out for the first time, by a boy I really liked who also liked me back. We were a really good couple, I think, with a lot of things in common and we always had a good time when we talked and hung out together at school.      However, there were a few problems. One was that while I wanted to hang out with him on Valentine's Day, his mother said he wasn't allowed on dates until he was 16, although she approved of him having a girlfriend and going out on group dates. His family is really active in the community and is very religious - he even has a purity ring - but that wasn't a huge deal for me. In fact, I even sort of didn't mind not being able to hang out with him alone, because I would still see him at school.      The problems started this Monday. He informed me that while he liked me a lot and wanted to go out with me, his mom said that he shouldn't have a girlfriend right now. This surprised me, especially since she was okay with it before. But it didn't hit me as hard as the fact that since he broke up with me, he hasn't spoken to me at all in the past three days. We've had many opportunities - I even went so far as to walk up to him and ask to talk to him - but every time it ends in him ignoring me or the friends of mine who are asking him about the situation.      Lately I've been doubting that he still likes me at all. The only thing that keeps me believing that he does is when he looks at me, I can read it in his face. But I might be misreading it too. Should I keep prodding at him and figure out the whole situation? Or should I keep giving him space until he's ready to talk? Or am I missing a big point completely?      Thanks so much for helping...

20090219191256AAqhrPY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to express feelings, but in a way that doesn't imply the wrong message and create an awkward situation?	I am currently working side by side with a woman I have met a few times via our mutual work environments.  She does not live in my town.  We have worked together for brief periods on two occasions in the past, both cases out of state.  I find her incredibly attractive and enjoy every moment we spend together.  I am not necessarily looking for romance, or for anything physical.  However, especially at this point, I want her to know how I feel.  More than anything, I want to stay in contact with her.  She is someone I can communicate with in a manner somewhat uncommon for me.  We are both in our 30's and will no doubt be crossing paths periodically from time to time.  Would some kind of direct expression of feelings, including the fact that I find her very attractive, be appropriate, even though I may not be looking for more than a friendship?  Would it be too much of a burden to place that knowledge on her?  Would it be best for all involved if I just left it they way it is, and simply enjoy her presence when our work brings us in proximately to one another?  I simply feel like telling her, and hopefully in a way that doesn't make her feel uncomfortable around me when our careers bring us together.

20090219191601AAOVGQ7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it true what they say "If he really loves you he will come back"?	I was involved in this "LONG DISTANCE" relationship and yes i am aware of what most people think about it. However, my relationship seemed to have been the best even though it lasted me about a year. We were so in love and had the best chemistry. It wasn't until our busy schedules got in the way, causing me to be a little unhappy. I decided to express my pain and how i felt forgotten but instead it caused me to lose him(atleast that how i saw it). He ended our relationship because he believed the timing was wrong and that we were putting our love at risk. I didnt know how to feel because i was hurt but at the same time he kind of was right. Acouple days after i expressed myself, again this time it was out of pain and anger. I said a bunch of things that came from my heart but also too much in the sense that it may have been hurtful and a slap in the face. I apologized the next day in an email. Other than that he has been ignoring me and i began to feel desperate not giving him his space. Afterwards i finally detached myself from my phone and the computer but its been a week and still no answer. I know time heals everything but could i have possibly lost him for good?Should i wait and give it time? What do I do? I love this guy and i don't want to stop.

The other day the girl i used to like txted me and asked wat was up. The she said she was sad and then i thought since we were talking i said i was confused becuase my friend said i was better off with her then the girl i currently like. When i was telling her i didnt say she was one of the girls i just said 2 girls. then she asked if i still had feelings for the other girl (which is her) and i said ya. Later i told her that she was one of the 2 girls. I almost positive she knew i liked her before cuz some of my friends are big mouths and told the whole school. thats y i'm wondering if thats y she asked if i still had feelings for the first (again which is her) now we've been txtin non stop for the past few days and gettin to know each other better.      Could this be a sign that she likes me back?

20090219192553AAWCrYz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any idea what the hell is going on?	Alright so last week I went to party in my apt complex and I actually happened to meet some people where I live back home.  There was one girl there that was acting really into and gave me really obvious signs she was (telling me i had nice eyes, introducing herself to me, leaning in and touching me every time I asked her something).  Unfortunately I was having too much of a good time and forgot to get her number but luckily I found her fb from another friend of hers that I met that night.  So I just sent her a friend request with a brief message attached tellin her who I was.  I didnt hear from her so I waited 3 days to contact her and asked her if she had fun visiting down here      She said she did but she was giving me pretty quick and brief questions and not asking me anything back.  So I left her the oppurtunity to get together when I come back home.  Apparently I found out she was only visiting which does suck but I go home often so if something does happen it could work.   I was about to give up but then she messaged me and asked if I had a younger brother and apparently she knows him.  So I just talked to her briefly but she signed off right when I was about to ask her for her number, but she would have still gotten the message.      So today I checked to see if I got any message back from her and I havent yet.   It looks like she barely uses her facebook though so I dunno if she checked her messages but this just confuses the hell out of me.  The only conclusion I can come to is that shes playing hard to get, hasnt responded or gotten the message yet or shes just a ***** but I really did not get that vibe from her.  She seemed really sweet and classy.  Does anybody have any idea what the hell is going on?

20090219213205AAIPW9f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	COLLEGE WOMEN: Would you date a guy that's a virgin?	This is especially for women that have had sex. Would you want to date a guy that is planning to stay a virgin until he's in a very serious relationship, or possibly even marriage? I'm a good looking guy, 6'7" 245 lbs muscular/toned build, black hair blue eyes. I'm extremely smart and nice too. It just seems like all the girls I meet are just looking for one night stands or short flings, when I'm not like that at all. I've had drunk girls try to come back to my dorm more than once but I don't want to have sex until I'm in love with the girl. I want to find a girl that's looking for somethign serious, but it's hard to find. So if your a girl that's had sex before would you date a guy that wants to wait until the relationship is serious to have sex or not?

20090219214557AAqqnRw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever been fooled by a passive aggressive person that wasn't interested in dating you?	I have. She acted polite in front of me, we got along, and even accepted my phone number so she could call me to go to a Haunted House with her. It's not until Halloween that she sends a guy to talk for her that she's not interested, and leave her alone. I would have been fine if she told me up front that she's not interested.    However I will say I don't like being mislead into thinking a girl is interested in me by her failing to be frank saying no up front which she did,  wasting her time and mine, and having some guy speak for her that she isn't interested when she is fully capable of doing that herself. All these happened because she didn't say no up front. Passive aggressive does not make a problem not go away, and it fact makes a problem larger. This attests to that.

How do I tell the difference???

Sometimes I catch him and he looks away. But when I look at him he smiles or waves.       Sometimes he gets up and walks over to my table. If I'm alone he sits across from me and talks a bit. But that's only when I'm alone.      I'm 14 and he's like... I don't know 25 or something. Does he like me?   He seems really nice and I know this shouldn't matter but, he's REALLY HOT.

He kinda just blew me off for another girl. With no communicating with me whatsoever. It's been 7 weeks. He text me today... but it was just to ask a question. I was being civil and short answered and he continued the convo after the question was answered. I was still short answered and our last words were nice, but I didn't write back to the last one. Is it ok to be civil with an ex who didn't treat you the greatest? I feel more at peace with everything; as if it were my closure. I'm not giving him another chance but was this the right thing to do?

20090203112401AAR9oEd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is wrong with this picture?	I have been with my fiancee for 2 years now and though I love him I have a strange vibe about him. So he is very sensitive about everything and he does communicate well about how he feels and believe me that is great  he takes me to nice dinners and seems very very attentive to my needs, he is always trying to do nice things for me and I should be thankful for that right, but I don't know why I would have the feelings I do SO....he very often asks me whats wrong and what the matter is with me, no matter what I say he keeps pushing and pushing till i get frustrated and he gets upset for me getting frustrated.... also he gets angry very fast and raises his voice just as quick he has never hit me but his bodylanguage shows how irate he is. He gets VERY angry very fast. We spend Christmas with his parents and while there we had 2 huge fights because I asked him to spend some time with me as well (he was in the garage with his dad building a race car about 20 hours a day) I mean he was YELLING at the top of his lungs and when I told he I was upset at how he acted it was even worse. Now mind you I am away from him right now because I am training for a job and we will be apart for 3 months. He seems to get angry more and more frequent now that we are engaged. He shakes and his face just looks so angry. Now he will say he is sorry when he is wrong. Mind you he is 31 and I 37 what is his deal. Then he turns around and tells me nothing will ever come between us what gives. He has only been in 2 long relationships his whole life, every woman that went on a date with him says he has anger issues. What is going on with him

20090219211720AAg5kC6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he keep doing this [kinda long]?	Last year I started high school. I met this kid through my sister then I don't know, some how I became a part of his group of friends.      The group I was in was 4 guys [all seniors] and a girl [a junior]. One of the guys I had met over the summer through the youth commission in my city.I wasn't apart it for long [I had ear surgery that summer so I wasn't really even apart of it at all].      We always talked in school. Everyday he would hug me and we would talk. He made my days better. Eventually we made out. This happened several times.       We had a little argument and stopped talking. It killed me.      Over the summer it was like every time I turned around he would be there. Weather I was in a car or walking down the street he would be there. On 2 occasions that I remember well we talked like old times. I was with the same person both times.      When we had our little fight he deleted me from Face-book. I was a little irritated but brushed it off. After seeing him over the summer I added him. He accepted then a few months later deleted me again. That time it hurt. I eventually got over it. A few weeks ago he added me again. I accepted because I think I want to be friends with him again. Like we were before anything had happened.      I want to know why he keeps doing this. Appearing when I'm starting to get over him. And adding and deleting me randomly.    Does he hate me?    How can I get him to stop playing this game without him being made? Is that possible?   Should I message him?   Guys what does this mean when you do this to a girl?         Also he would tell me he loved me and all that then he would go flirt with other girls infront of me. He would look at me and kind of smile when he did it too. Like he knew I could see what he was doing.      Was he trying to hurt me or did he think it was funny?

20090219201322AAJHerY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	QUESTION FOR BOYS (and girls. But boys'll help better)?	So... if you liked this girl almost allll of the last school year, and knew she liked you back, but you both were in seventh grade and decided not to go out. So yeah you still flirted and talked and it was cute but you didn't really text her because you always lost your phone and just weren't really a texter in general, not that it mattered because you guys talked at school. You keep on liking her until school ends.      So then the summer goes by, you don't talk to her once. School's back, you have no classes together... you see her frequently in the halls but never talk. Then, one day, out of the blue she goes up and talks to you for a bit you SMILE AND ITS HELLA CUTE <3 while you're the type of guy who has hardly any friends who are girls and who hardly ever smiles... you give her this BIG HEARTMELTING SMILE. :] After this, you change your bike path so you're on the same as hers. A week goes by, and you don't talk, until the last school day you have before valentines day, she gives you a valentine. No biggie, she gave them to a lot of her friends but since you hadn't talked in a while it was a little unexpected. About five days later, over break, she texts you and you actually reply... she gets 21 messages from you in a 24 hour period, you get 19 from her. Now break's over, and you've been at school one day, she hasn't talked to you but it's only been one day.      1) if you were in this situation, would it be possible that you still liked her? (cuase i still like him but I didn't realize it until I spoke to him)   2) Would you think she liked you back? You're not what you would call a ladies man... you've never had a gf, then again you're only in eighth grade. In fact, you really don't talk to girls much, and really don't have any (not sure but don't think so... maybe some from camp and a couple from school) friends that are girls...    3) WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET HIM TO LIKE ME?? Tomorrow is 8th graders open gym day were the 8th graders can go play b-ball... and I have to take pictures... I'm 100% sure he'll be there. Any suggestions? I already know what I'm wearing, lol.

20090219204421AAdKWze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people act like getting married is something we all have to do as if it's a part of life?	Hi all! Why do people act like getting married is something we all have to do as if it's a part of life? Here in the US, people constantly talk about dreaming of getting married one day but they also talk about how divorces are on the rise all the time. I just don't get it. I'm very independent and I'm not gay. I'll never get married or have kids and I'm very happy with that decision of mine. But why do people treat me as though I'm abnormal for that? I just don't understand it. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090219210009AAjMI4E	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is always getting mad at me. What can i do?	My mom has this habbit of yelling at me and my siblings and lecturing to make sure we "get the point". it hurts me a lot, and it also hurts my siblings. she's yelling at us for a ton of stuff. such as today. she got mad at me for texting my best friend. she said "why do you need to text so much. you always go over your texting limit! i think that there is really no reason to text so i think you should just STOP! your just wasting your time!"   no that hurt a lot because:   1) i do so much for her. she wants me to do piano and violin. and i have no option of quiting. its her dream for me to become the next Itzak Perlman.    2) she hates that i do sports. she doesnt think i get enough practicing in and that by quiting sports everything will be solved.      i know that she is stressed out alot, but i dont get why she takes it out on her children. this has been happening my whole life. she gets really mad at me and just yells to get her point across. i know i need to respect her because she is my mom but sometimes i just wanna yell right back.    my dad says that she had a hard childhood while growing up, but does that mean she can make my childhood hard as well? ive talked to my dad about this. and hes talked to her about it too. shes tried to stop, but when she gets stressed out again, the yelling comes right back. what can i do?

20090219200334AAOamur	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Ok so I met her around september last year. She is this really awesome girl, not only does she have this awesome personality she is extremely pretty too. I fell in love with her and I want to know if she might like me:      We are still in school      Positives:   -She always laughs at my jokes, even the ones that sound stupid   -She would walk up to me whenever she saw me with a smile   -She sometimes stares at me and points at me with friends   -She called me 'cute'   -She sometimes teases me in an innocent way   -The other day I was copying her in a test and she noticed and in a playful voice she called me a cheater. She then covered her paper and I begged her but she shook her head. I turned around doing my work and then she tapped my shoulder and let me copy   (Negatives)   -She always hugs her male friends in my friend, she never hugs me   -She talks a lot and even sends notes to other guys while she is sometimes quiet and shyish with me      Today I was with her in class. The guy behind me kept kicking me cus i kept annoying him (haha) and then I told her (she sits next to me) if we could trade seats. She asked why? And I told her, he is trying to kill me (refering to the guy behind me), she turned around and asked, why are you trying to kill him? If you want to kill him just stab him with a knife. Her answer sort of confused me so I said, yeah just make it quick and she laughed.      What does this mean?

20090219211401AAFFvpW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think he's afraid of dating cause his ex gf cheated on him, what can i do to take away his fear & help him?	So this guy, we had a thing.   He told me he really liked me, and i told him i really liked him.   Then we kissed and stuff, and a couple days later he found out his ex gf cheated on him & told me he didn't want to get hurt and that he'd lost all emotions for me now. He said he's bad with relationships.   I kind of think he still cares & that was just an excuse cause he didn't want to get hurt again, cause he got super jealous that i kissed his friend & he was upset about it.       I know he's going through alot right now, but i just want him to see that he has nothing to be afraid of.   What can i say or do to help him get over this fear & relize that maybe he just needs a relationship with someone he can trust?

20090219202236AAwDaZG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We're just friends, but is he wanting something more?	So I have a crush on a friend of mine and I told him that I had a crush, not on him but on someone. He doesn't know who it is but he all of a sudden became very interested in who it was. He is constantly asking me for more information about the guy. Does his sudden interest mean he may be interested or is he just being a good friend. Another thing that made me wonder was while doing a group exercise, we were all suppose to sit down and tell one another what was good and what was bad about our skills within the Air Force ROTC. When he got to telling me what was good about my skills he said that I was a go getter and what was bad about my military professionalism was that I smiled and lost my bearing sometimes. "I'm mean just look at her smile", is what he said with a smile. Does this mean anything or am I just hoping it means something?

I'm 19 and She's 24   I wouldn't call it a date, but i went out to go eat with her(alone) and we talked a lot... somehow the conversation ended up about dating different age groups, she specifically said she didn't like the idea of girls dating younger guys, anywhere from 5 years to 90 years younger. I felt like this was a hint that there was no way in hell that she would ever consider me as more than a friend.   Anyways about a week later i TEXTED her 'would you be my valentine?' and still to this day (let's see two weeks? idk) she hasn't texted me back or called.      I'm not stupid, I get the hint but i haven't told her how i feel about her. I'm considering calling her and telling her or meeting her somewhere to tell her. So the question is...       Am i making an *** out of myself and should i just get over her?
20090219203139AAxcYWd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	3 questions about 1 girl.?	I meet her over the summer. i asked her out and we went out twice. we both went away to separate schools and to my surprise, we stayed in contact the first semester (16 weeks) through texting only.    over the winter break i asked her out again. we went out 3 times. during this time i asked her if she had a boyfriend. when she said no, i told her that i liked her a lot. she said she liked me too. after that, we had to go back to our schools were we continued texting again just about everyday. i rather talk, so on some nights i would call her but no answer. but the next morning she would text just saying "wats up". about four weeks into the semester, i was the only one texting. she replied but never just started a conversation. i didn't want to feel to "needy" so i stopped too. about a week went by with no conversation. on her facebook status it read "i have the best boyfriend in the world". (but her relationship status was "single".) during this time i felt hurt, but i was convincing myself to leave her alone and move on with my life. even though she never calls me, she called me on Valentine's night unexpectedly! we didn't talk about us, just about movies and our interest and stuff. i texted her next day telling her that i saw her status. she said she does not have a boyfriend but she said there is a boy at school that keeps looking at her page and she put the status up there so he'll stop looking at her facebook. That’s the last thing we said to each other. my questions are:      1) does she see me as a friend or more?      2) Should I contact her, or is the ball in her court?      3) I feel assured that she does not have a boyfriend but o you think she was lying about why she had it up there?

20090219210604AAmU85y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My mom is sexy in front of my friends. It embarasses my, what should I do?	Okay, so I am a 16-year-old guy and my mom is like 35. She is in good shape and looks very young... she also has fairly sexy boobs. She flashes her boobs around a lot, I mean that she shows a lot of cleavage. It is really embarassing when my friends are around.She would sometimes bend down for something and all my friends stare down her shirt. One day her nipples were flashing right out and she didn't realize it. My friends were there and they pretty much were awed by it. Last week I had a few friends come over for a sleepover and my mom had invited her new boyfriend over aswell and we rented a movie. But the whole time she and her bf were making out and he had his hands under her shirt squeezing her boobs! How would you like it if a stranger was squeezing your moms boobs in front of you and all your friends? They were hardly watching the movie. Then later, they went to sleep and we could hear them having sex. She acts all sexy all the time and my friends seem to think she's all sexy (I'm not saying she isn't) but I don't like her doing such things in front of my friends! What should I do? HELP!
20090219213039AAM6mG6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE help me...I'm just stuck and I need some help...?	ok, so here's the deal with this guy...   I've known him for a few years, about two I think. I used to have a small crush on him, but nothing huge because he goes to another school. We are in a band together and about two months ago he asked me to go to his school dance as his date. I went and it was really fun, but I liked someone else at the time so the whole night I felt a little distracted. The following weeks I felt like the biggest b*tch in the world because he made it very apparent that he had feelings for me, and I just kept on pushing him away.      NOW a few months later, I can't stop thinking about him. We talked the other night, and he asked me about the night at the dance. I could tell that some of his feelings were still there. So I thought, this guys is here, waiting for me. Now, he and I are talking and texting almost everyday and yet...we aren't getting anywhere. It's like, when I didn't want to go out with him he wouldn't leave me alone. And now that I would like to date him, things aren't the same. I know he still likes me, but I can't help but feel like he's making me sweat or something.      So basically my question is, what can I do to really show him I want to go out with him now? I am an independant girl, and I'm not a fan of beating around the bush...but at the same time I've tried being blunt with guys in the past and it's gotten me nowhere. Any suggestions? I really want to hang out with him soon...any advice would be amazing.      PS this is a repost so please answer
20090219201230AAhDeJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you give me a reason to keep trying?	well im a depressed kid, i have to admit that. I doubt everything, I wake up every morning and ask myself why do I even go to school. In class my mind some times wonder why do I keep doing this. I guess I just don't have motivation to do anything anymore. I some times want to run away and never come back. My parents don't help, all they do is just yell at me and push me and bring me down. I plan on going to the army when I turn 18 and just die there, i mean, i figure if i die i might as well do something good before i do. but all i have to ask is, what reason can you possibly give me to keep trying for anything?
20090219212715AASBsZx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get this hot girl to date me?	I want answers from someone who is in this situation or in a similar one. And please, spare me your judgments about my "lack of character". Anyway here is my story. I am totally digging this Filipina girl, problem is she is my my GRE tutor at Kaplan. She is totally smart, attends Brown, and Fu*k is she hilarious. It doesn't hurt that she use to be an import model (she had to to help pay her tuition). Would it be inappropriate to ask her out. I mean, she has mentioned some aspects of her life to me, and you wouldn't share that if you weren't comfortable or interested in a person right? Also, a small problem...she has a boyfriend, but I think I trump the guy in the looks department. He looks like one of those "scholarly types" as my friend puts it. I've been told that I look a lot like Colin Farrel, so would she dump the guy and take interest in me if I asked her out. Is buying her an expensive gift a good idea, and will that win her over?

20090219212138AAzfJXP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Trying to talk to this guys. HELP!!!?	Ok so I met this guy through a friend and he is a mellow guy. He is not looking to rush into anything because he is in college, a band, writes music and tutors. I like him and the last i heard he liked me. We talk on Facebook but he is only on about once a week so as you can tell he is not a computer person because he does not have the time and this is all moving slow ... very slow so i know he is going to California in a couple weeks with this family and I wanted to send him something funny like a link to a funny video about California or something. I want to know if anyone knows of any links. I feel if I send this to him I can send it as a message and possible spark a longer conversation than leaving messages on each others wall.   31 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   this is my only problem with asking him his number .. the mutual friend we have is really good friends with him .. they have been friends since they were little and its a guy and he was stupid and told this guy i thought he was "so fuckin hot" and i dont want to seem desperate ... and i know guys dont like girls that they know are into them ... they like mystery and i dont want to seem needy .. what should i do???

20090219211201AA18ZEh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't get it? (please answer)?	My best friend is 17 and a senior in a private high school. Shes beautiful, popular and the president of our year. Shes dated the quarterback of the football team and the best swimmer in the school. Last year she started hanging out with this girl and her friends from a public school and I told her that I thought the girl had a crush on her and my friend admitted to me that she was gay and had a crush on the girl. The two of them started dating a little while later. I dont care that shes gay, but I feel like the other girl made her gay. I don't get how she could go from dating "rich cute guys" to dating a public school girl. She never slept with any of her boyfriends, but after dating this girl for about 9-10 months she slept with her.
20090219205915AA3iS5L	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP I need help I really like this guy. He is a Gemini and I am a Taurus.?	He is so tall and funny and smart but I am a firm believer in astrology. He is a Gemini and I am a Taurus. I tried to turn astrology out the window but its hard. I am very straight forward and he is always beating around the bush.       He says he likes me "as a friend" but yet he flirts around with me.       I told him I had a crush on him and that I would "kiss him" and says he wouldn't mind.       We were even suppose to exchange Christmas gifts. I got him a Ralph Lauren track jacket. He told me none of his friends have ever done something so nice for him and he seemed really elated.      I even said he could help me with my squats at the gym (in a flirting way he said when)      I just don't understand. Astrology says to take it slow and keep things interesting but this is my first REAL crush and I'm in college--This is ridiculous. Am I doing too much. Should I contact him less? I really like him and wouldn't mind him being in my corner hes cute, intelligent, and we are in the same major (different minors).      I feel over the top when I'm with him, I find myself getting ready in the morning with him in mind. What am I supposed to do guys? I am so confused.

20090219211903AAj9qKS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think there is slight chance that  he might Possibly like me?	Okay there is this guy in my English that i really like and i want to know if he might possibly like me too. So in class I sit in the front row and the guy i like sits a few desks behind me in the same row, so he has to walk right beside me to get to his desk. A few days ago he was walking beside past me and I looked up at him and he kept his head staring straight but his eyes moved to the left in my direction and it looked like he was looking at me but he could have been looking at the person next to me. Do you think he was maybe checking me out? Also  usually when he first walks in the room we look at each other for a couple seconds then look away but he will not look at me at all anymore. Now He'll look at the floor in front of my desk, then he'll look over top of me. Why do you think he won't look at me anymore? Then Finally about 3 weeks ago at the end of class we were all waiting at the door and I was looking at the broad behind him and i seen him look in my direction and then i looked at him and i seen him turn and look at the broad right where i was looking. Why do you think he did that? Okay I'm, sorry that it's so long and confusing but do you think there is a slight possibility that he might like me? Please be honest. i know it's probably nothing but i just want some opinion don't be rude though. Thank you so much.

20090219214252AAm8rU0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone help me, what would this girl be thinking?	There is this girl who lives down the hall from me who I have known for about five months and really like, but even though we are around each other a lot I always get really quiet and kind of just sit there. She's kind of shy too so even when it's just the two of us sitting there it's just awkward silence. I feel like she must think I either don't like her or are a creep/loser (neither of which are true, I'm just nervous around her). To make things worse, in addition to being a really great person she's also really attractive and gets hit on a lot by weird obsessive guys.      I want to let her know I really like her but don't want to come off as just another creep. I know I have to just start talking to her more, but is there any chance at this point that she could still like me too, or am I permanently that weird antisocial guy???
20090219205404AACZFlL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married guys, is it okay to flirt like this guy?	There is this man (who is engaged), that I occasionally run into for work reasons, and from time to time I kind of pick up that he flirts with me. A few signs is that he is very attentive when we have a conversation, he compliments me a lot, stares/smiles at me when he thinks I'm not looking, and has said that he is sure that most guys won't mind me passed out on their steps, or that the reason why my guy friends always had their drinks comped at bars is because they were with me. Also, we were discussing tattoos one day, and he said he had a few, and I mentioned I had a few too, my newest being on my hipbone. He asked to see it and was heading to shut the door of his office when the phone rang. As I was leaving, he said to e-mail it to him so he can see. Is he flirting, and is it normal for happily married men to do this? Or is he just being nice? I want to know so that I can adjust my attitude around him as to not lead him on.

20090219212551AArvkVy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	EASY QUESTION ...........................?	A lot of people get hung up on their bf/gf number. I don't really know my number. Let me explain. I use to be in the military and no I didn't go after every girl in every port. I was a very faithful person and only wanted to be with the person I was seeing. Then I had a sting of girls who screwed me over when I would go out to sea. Finally I got tired of it and hit rock bottom when the last one did a number on me. I started to drink a lot and go out with girls, sleep with them and dump them. I finally stopped because I was loosing sleep over the guilt of what I had done to them. I have always believed no man should ever disrespect a woman and I should be shot for what I did. Know I'm out, 30 and I don't know what woman are going to say of this, and yes I have been tested and I'm fine. I have yet had someone ask but...   Input please??? Have I dug a hole without an exit?

And my hair is VERY short. And when I get a little older, it's going bald like this-      (ignore the piercings)    http://xb3.xanga.com/f68d1a6643635850788...     http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2603...

20090219211844AApsTxg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I have invited him in?	Tonight was our second date.  Monday was our first.  Monday we went to lunch and then afterward went to his house and watched a movie and then he took me home.  Nothing happened while we were at his house...we were just hanging out.  Anyway, tonight we went to the movies and then he brought me home and walked me to my door.  We kissed for a minute and then he said he'd call me later.  Is it rude that I didn't invite him in?  I didn't want him to get the wrong idea about me, because I really like him....he is so sweet and I can already tell he is someone that I could fall for.    Will he think that I don't like him or at least don't like him that much since I didn't?  I'm divorced and back into the single world after being married for 7 years....I'm 27.  So advice would be appreciated!  :)

20090219204053AAES5mU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SO can someone tell me what the problem is??!! HELP!!?	Ok, a friend of mine tried to fix me up with a guy that she works with and he asked for a pic of me, and I gave him a few. The thing is that he wasn't suppose to keep any of them, but he ended up keeping one.            To make a long story short, he told me that I was really pretty to him. There were two separate occasions that we were suppose to go out and meet and he stood me up on both occasions. Then when I try to call him out on it he doesn't have an answer for it or either he'll ignore my calls and texts.            So since he can't keep his promise, I wrote him a text telling him that I wanted him to give me my picture back since he can't seem to keep him promise whenever we talk about meeting up...again...he ignored it. So to fastforward, the girl that works with him told him the first thing this morning that I wanted my picture back, and she stated hat he acted as if he got mad, and said that he was acting like he was going to his car to go get it, but then when he came back that he didn't have the picture with him and said that he wasn't giving it back. I already told him that it would have been best if we could be friends because he can't seem to keep his promises, and I don't like people that don't do what they say they'll do, and he clearly isn't a man of his word. So my question is, in your opinion, why isn't he giving me my pic back??      Also he told the girl that tried to hook us up that I was acting "crazy" with him. All I did was call him out on his bullcrap. If you say that you are going to do something, then do it!! Don't lie about it...      So what's the problem????!! HELP!!!

Okay so at the beginning of the school year, i met this girl that i like in many different ways. The problem is: I recently had a house fire and lost all my stuff. then 3 days after that, i went to the dance and she asked me to dance with her. But, i know she didn't want to dance with me because she likes me or something, i think it was because she felt sorry for me. I was going to get her something for V day, but i couldn't find anything that I could buy. I didn't want to ask my parents for money because they hardly had any. (my dad left his wallet in the car that blew up and my mom left her purse inside =S). but i am also one of the least popular kids in school (Not counting the fire) and she is somewhere near the top of the list! I'm nowhere near as good looking as she deserves, but i am a good friend, smart, and honest. I don't know but i think she is already going out with someone. And i dont want to ask because people might get suspicious. I wan't help on how to look better so i can be perfect for when i ask her. (yes im overweight). But then again, she is nice so she may say yes. HELP?!?!

20090219214509AAWQ6ZV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would it bother you if someone you loved was dating a single parent?	I'm just curious as to what people's opinions of me might be if you had never met me. I am gettin' back into the whole dating thing, looking for a serious relationship, and I was wondering if you just knew a few details about me what you would think if I was dating your brother/ son/ friend, etc. Mkay, here are the details:      - I am 20 years old   - Became a single parent at the age of 17, my 3rd year of high school, graduated early, in the national honors society, #3 in my class   - My daughter's father left when she was 2 months old, right before I started my senior year in high school, havent seen/ heard of him since,    - I am a (successful) college student, finishing up my junior (3rd) year, majoring in Biological Science, I am going to be a nurse. I was on the deans list my first 2 years.   - To go to college I left my rural village to go to a big city with just me and my daughter, she had just turned 1 year old at the time   - I fully support myself and my daughter, no assistance from family, no welfare, etc.      I know a lot of people have a hard time looking past the whole single parent part, and a lot of parents wouldn't want their son dating a girl who already has a child.    1. Do you think that my other accomplishments make it easier for a parent/ family member to accept me as their son's girlfriend?    2. The guy I have in mind is 24 years old, would you think that he is old enough to date someone like me without his parents getting all protective?   3. If you didn't know about the deans list, me supporting myself, and graduating high school early and top of my class, and all you knew was that i have a 3 year old daughter and i am in my 3rd year of college, what would you think?      Thanks, i just want your personal opinion! =)

Oh and he has a WIFE!   What would you make of this, would you flirt, want your daughter to hook up with him (even though he is 30 and she's 18) or what? Or would you be respectful, knowing he is married?    What do you think most women would do?   I know many women who would jump at this specimen, regardless of marriage status.      And before any answers like "ditch him, he has a wife" make note, I AM his wife. I feel he thinks too much of the common good that women are all genuinely nice ppl who never think about getting in a man's pants, because he grew up in another place where manners and good morals prevailed....   So, I am asking what would you or your friends do regarding my charmer, my husband?

I don't know how he feels about me, but I really really really like him. I have feelings for him, but right now we are just friends. I'm leaving the country in June and I want to tell him, but I'm afraid to. I also want to tell him that I have feelings for him, but I don't know how. We are both the same age and have the same interests. He hangs out with me a lot, and a lot of friends have told me we are a great couple, including my mom. He is funny, sweet, kind, and supportive. I just... I don't know what to do. :(      Please help me.      Thanks so much and God Bless!      ~Sara-May~
20090203112558AAtHxxp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband has total irrational anger and freaks out like a child, I can't seem to find anything like this!?	I am feeling like I'm just totally done with this relationship but I don't know what to do. I am three months pregnant, first time I've ever been pregnant, and I want the best for my child. Unfortunately my worst fears are coming to pass and I just feel like I need a complete change.   I've been married to this guy for almost three years, we dated for a year beforehand and I've known him on and off for about 6 years. He is a teacher and ironically is getting his Phd in world peace studies.    About six months into our happy marriage I witnessed him pick up his office chair over his head and slam it to the ground nearly hitting our cat. He broke the chair and then punched himself in the head repeatedly while he mumbled something. This episode was completely unwarranted and caused by me not wanting to speed out of a parking lot and follow someone that had a car that matched the description of a car that sideswiped our car a few weeks back. I am a rational person and figured that even If i would have caught them I could not have really done anything, and anger never solves anything, plus I was late for work. But he was so mad that I had to take him home where this incident occurred. I then went to work and told him that this relationship wasn't going to work and I was very serious at the time. I've never seen anyone do something like that. Of course a few hours later he showed up at my job apologizing and telling me that it would never happen again. I wanted this relationship to work so I let it go assuming that is was a fluke.    Naturally as the months went by he started to act out even more. The episodes range from, throwing things across the room, breaking plates, throwing the cats, chasing the cats (terrifying one so bad one night that he sprayed and then cowered, this is a rescue cat that I adopted because he was previously abused), He actually headbutted me one night in a bar because he thought I was making fun of the way he dances, he has nearly hit my best friend with a beer bottle, he has done extremely dangerous things on the road like erratic u turns and brake slamming, swerving, and driving off road in a chevy cobalt. Also, he has jumped out of moving cars numerous times because of irrational fears. He is even so crazy that he does these things in front of other people including my friends. His name is nick and my friends have given him names like Nick attack, Nick fit and Nick at night. These names infuriate him because he never thinks that his behavior is out of line. His friends say that he has always been like this. The other day I made a comment about his clothes being all over the floor so he picked them up and hurled them into the bathroom, first he tried to open the window to throw them outside but the wimp couldn't get the window open. Then he calmly says, "are you coming to bed honey." Also, when we fight about this and I cry he often starts to try to have sex with me because he thinks that if I have sex with him then it's all forgotten about. I'm totally disgusted by him and haven't let him touch me for three months. I fear for my child but my job is not enough to support me. I've asked him numerous times to go to anger management, he slightly agrees but then makes no attempt to follow through. This time he swears he will because I threatened to leave him, but he still refuses  to admit that he has any serious problem. He actually said to me last night that not many people have the core values that he has because he wants to work for world peace. Do you think he is trying to drive me insane to keep me here? Do you think he has ADHD? What do I do I'm so angry and worried for my baby. I'm so scared that it may inherit this.

20090219212257AAfNKDi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship problem, What should I do?	I asked a girl out 2 days ago and got rejected. Now i found out she feel really bad rejecting me and keeps asking my friends if i feel bad. I still want to get with her. I figure i should just get to know her better first. But, most of you know, if you get rejected and these words is spoken :" I only see you as a friend" Its most likely you guys just stay friends. I don't want to just stay friends. I spend way too much time on her, and denied 3 girls (fine girls) because of her. And i don't know, i just feel like she's the one ,you know? The one that's long-lasting and independent. So now she feels bad and I think i should make a move. What should I do? If i pretend im not upset, she would just keep seeing me as a friend. SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?

20090219215213AASN8pl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can long distance relationships have a happy ending?	I have been in a long distance relationship for more than 6 months. We met through a chat room and have had a wonderful time every time we were together. I visited his hometown twice but he only introduced me to one of his friends, no family even though he talks about them all the time. I recently found out that he does not refer to me as his girlfriend but his friend but he is still so nice to me and treats me with respect. Should I continue dreaming, thinking that this relationship might actually work out?

20090219212154AALEAvq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I'm in love with my best friend.?	I'm sixteen and my best friend is nineteen. We've been best friends for a little over a year, and in that year we have became inseparable. My mom absolutely loves him, and I'm close with his parents as well. He has a baby boy with an ex-girlfriend, but he's denied visitation with him because the mother of the baby is honestly crazy. Her and I have got into many arguments, because she says I've replaced her in his life and all these other things. He's honestly the most amazing person I have ever met. He's beautiful inside and out. We've talked about how I use to have the biggest crush on him when we were younger, and I didn't even know him, and he throws that out there every now and again. We have fooled around, many times, and thankfully, it has never changed the way we look at each other. I've always heard people say that one morning they just woke up and felt completely in love with someone, but I always thought that they were just full of crap, but honestly, I woke up one day, took one look at him and saw him in a completely different light. He tells me everything, and vice versa. His brothers always tease me by saying, "So, you and my brother are pretty close, huh?" and they'll hit me with their elbows and wink at me. I'm not really sure if he feels the same way though. All of our friends say that we practically date, already, because we're together all the time. I mean, we even spent all of Valentine's Day together. I'm just completely lost. You don't have to give me advice, this was just kind of a way to get everything off my chest without anyone seeing it on my myspace or facebook. But, advice or first hand experiences would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks!

20090219193341AAQNqXR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex and I had sex and he said he wanted to be best friends again?	I called my ex and made amends the other night and it was all done. He called me the next night and we had a three hour conversation that ended with us sneaking out at 12 to see each other. At first we were just hanging out, smoking cigarettes and talking and all of a sudden, he mentions that him and his girlfriend are on a break,      I have feelings for him and he kept touching me and telling me I was his first love, etc. He kissed me and asked me if we could go back to my house. We snuck back into my room and started kissing and had sex. We then lay together watching Spongebob and cuddling. He left at 2am and he kissed me before he left.      He said he'd call me if he could hang out on Friday and I needed to know if we were hanging out, so I could make other plans so I called him and he said he still wanted to be best friends but couldn't trust himself to hang out with me alone. He kept mentioning tension and how he feels bad even he's on a break with his girlfriend.      What does this mean? He said he's still coming to my birthday party and that we can chill but with other people around. Doesn't this mean he's indecisive or something? This wasn't a booty call. We originally just wanted to talk.

20090219193927AAzQ67V	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I send this note to her?	Okay there's this girl named dasha at school. She's Russian. And very pretty anyways I don't usually talk to her unless we go in groups because her accent is sorta funny but it's also the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. So today I asked her how to say green and when she told me I laughed at her. I can't control it. That's why I'm writing this apology note. Here's what I have:      Hey,    I hope I didn't hurt your feelings yesterday. But I tend to laugh at the wrong things at the wrong time. I think that your accent is awesome. And I wasn't laughing at you. My friend was acting like an idiot, which made me laugh. Sorry again if I hurt your feelings. Maybe we can hang out sometime.   -Brooke      PS: I'd like to learn how to speak Russian. Maybe you can teach me sometime? I tried looking up the words on the Internet. But I just can't seem to get the pronunciation's right. (I wrote thanks in Russian here) ha.             --------------------------------------...      So that's it. What do you think? Don't say to do it in person because I'll probably end up laughing in her face. Because I'm like that. I'm wierd. Thanks guys. Anything I should talks out or add? Thanks again!

20090219194943AAOrXSc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think he was checking me out!!?	So, I attend this meeting for the second time, and I notice that this guy seems to be making eye contact with me often. Like, I'm not a speaker at the meeting. Matter of fact, I'm just observing. He's one of the main speakers. I think, "surely, he isn't doing what I think he's doing." So, I muster up the courage to do a test: I hold his gaze for a few seconds longer before looking away. Ohmigah!!! The guy doesn't break the gaze...I do. Am I right? Is he attracted? Just when I doubt, I FEEL him looking at me. Like, we're in a room full of people and it's like he doesn't care that others may wonder why his attention isn't on the person who's speaking but on something (ME) towards the back of the room. Now, I feel a bit strange going to future meetings. It's not that I don't find the guy attractive; he's actually very attractive. It's just that we're totally not a match. He's significantly older than I (been there, done that) and I just don't think that there's any compatibility there. What do I do? Am I just imagining this?

Ok so I know this guy and he's 20 and we like each other.. but we haven't gone on a date yet.. we've known each other for 5 weeks or so.. and we both cam chat all the time.. so one time he asked me to take off my top on cam. i felt a lil uncomfortable since we're not dating but I didn't want to upset him so i listend to him.. now he expects me to do whatever he says for him on cam and I've had enough i told him that i think we should first go on a date and get to know each other more and then do all this kind of stuff.. and he said I should relax and just have fun and that I need to be more wild and he was like comon just for 5 minutes... I don't understand why he can't just understand me we always fight because he gets mad that I won't strip on cam for him! and he says he hates it when i get serious.. but it seems like he doesn;t get serious enough does it seem like he just wants to get pleasure from me and not an acutal relationship?  what should I do?

Were both 18, we go to 2 different colleges, and we barely have time to spend with each other. When we do have time to spend, all we do is either go to the movies, out to eat, or go over each others house and chill and watch TV. When were on the phone, we have nothing to talk about. All we say is "hey baby, how are you, how was your day?" then its all boring from there. I REALLY don't want to leave him, but i really don't know what else to do. We've been together for  3 YEARS NOW, thats hard to walk away from.      So can you please give me some kind of advise as to what I should do?   THANKS...

20090203110849AADd6mw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I have already told him how i felt?	I have already told him how i felt about everything though. We had been talking for 2 1/2 months after we broke up, now we don't talk at all. He acts like he is too good for me when i see him in school. He told me a little over a month ago that he didn't love me or like me anymore, but i don't understand how that could be when we dated over a year? I really don't know why I broke up with him for no reason all the time, I guess its just the first thing i jumped too and i never thought to talk to him about it first. When i broke up with him that day i thought that's what i really wanted and i guess he thought i was serious. I thought to myself later that night though what did i just do!!, i called him back and apologized and said i love you and im sorry idk what i did, and we got back together and i thought everything was fine. The next day apparently everything wasn't okay, he was getting sick of me doing this to him all the time and just wanted to end it. :( and i have been unhappy ever since. we just had so much together, and i felt he could and still can only be himself around me. We were cray together and acted like you wouldnt believe, im not even over reacting here. I have already done the things i shouldnt have done to try to get him back. Drive by his house, crying to him begging to take me back, non-stop apoligizing, saying i will change and never do it to him again. Although maybe all along i should have just left him along and maybe he would have come back to me?

20090203111734AAiKWDC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Men, You would know .....WHY MY HUSBAND ACTS WEIRD AROUND MY female FRIEND?	Ok so; me and my husband have been married for nearly two years, we are both in our mid 20’s. Good sex life, average married life, no real problems. He’s the tall athlete type, and I am the gorgeous model type.  (Please, Im not conceded)  Lately, I’ve had a female attorney friend come over (I’m a paralegal) and eat dinner with me and my husband. She is A LOT shorter then me but very cute, semi-attractive. I notice he is awkwardly nice towards her, which is unusual for him. He is usually not very social and is never chatty with my friends.  He also acts defensive towards me if I say anything like “shut up” playing around her. Does he like her? Or am I just being an insecure, petty B****?       –o- and she seems to take HIS side on our conversations and agrees with him on ALL, when shes over.      Please give me some imput?

I think sometimes he walks by me on purpose or stands close to me on purpose. We always make eye contact in the hall. Once or twice we said hi to each other, but that's it. He's a cashier at Stop and Shop (haha) and I went on his line a few times to get milk or whatever. He was really nice a few times and we made small talk. The last time I went he looked upset and he wouldn't even look at me and mumbled everything he said. I think it was because I was there. Does he like me or hate me?
20090219204515AAKyg7p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I believe her? It doesn't  make sense to believe her.?	I've been broken up wit my ex for 5 mnths. I've lately considered taking her back because she's made some changes. She's made some friends also. One in particular calls all the time evn late into the night.... I guess its ok becuz were both single. But the problem is she claims to want to get back with me and claims I'm the only one the she's messing with.(cuz we still screw) anyways, I wanted to talk to her bout getting back and needed to know that she meant what she said b4 bout only bein wit me. So I checked her txt msgs and found there's more to her friendsship with the guy callin all the time. Msgs frm him like "oh u gonna give me head?" And the next day she replies to different txt "bein mean to me after I gave u head.Lol" she claims they were jokin and nothin ever happened. I say its bullshit. Other msgs frm her read" thanks to u my back hurts" and he replies "next time I put it u know where.Lol" she says that's why they end it wit Lol, becuz they're jokin around.... Should I believe that nothing ever happened? Or would I be stupid to believe it and not give her anthr chance... BTW, were 2gether for 6 yrs b4 we broke up

And he cut himself on accident, recently, and he kept coming up to me showing me the progress of his finger, if it was still bleeding..   and then i decided to pick on him by saying "You think there's gunna be a scar?" and he started laughing and said "I think i'll get a scar." and while we were talking his dad turned around, looked at his son and i, shook his head and started laughing.   Also, i had my teeth cut out before one of our 'big games' and he was making sure i was well enough to play the bb game.

I have a TON of trouble talking to guys, particularly ones that I like...because of how I was raised and the people I hung around with I've always been really shy. And because of this my relationship is gonna screw up all bad. It's been a while since I've talked to my boyfriend for certain reasons, and for some reason(I dunno what they are, of thought of this a lot and cant figure out why), I'm scared to talk to him now. I was face to face with him and couldn't say anything!! I've tried really hard for almost a week to talk to him...and I haven't been able to. I keep feeling like I'm gonna faint, get light-headed, and really nervous. I've tried telling myself that I can do this, and that he'll listen to whatever I say, and that I have nothing to worry about, but it doesn't help any. I forget it all the moment I try. I have no idea what to do but I NEED to talk to him extremely bad. Any tips or things I can do to make this easier?
20090219212103AA1D7tM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help with the girl I like?	What should I do if I like this girl that I have known forever and we are really good friends, but she has a boyfriend of 1 year. The thing is that she says that she loves him, but she says he is most of the time a jerk and mean to her, and flips on her all the time, she said that she tries really hard to make him happy but most of the time they just end up arguing and fighting. She gave me a ride to her car today and her boyfriend called, she put the phone on speaker so I could hear the conversation, from what I heard he really is a dick to her. Well I have always been there for her and always try to make her happy when he makes her sad. What should I do? I would really want to date her, but I would rather her be happy, problem is she really isn't happy right now, and I think it's because of her boyfriend.

20090219222835AA1Bc8V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is the time to start looking for a girlfriend?	OK i know this question sounds a little silly at first, but what I mean is...Is there a right or a wrong time to start looking for a girlfriend or should I not think about it and get on with life? It's just that so rarely does a pretty female come along who grabs my attention, I am not sure what to do sometimes. Now this may be odd, but I have never had a gf and I'm 20. Is this OK or should I be concerned?       Also, I seem to be a little picky in my preferences, because some types I will avoid completely (eg loud/party types), and other types I will be attracted to, but sometimes I don't want to bother because it is so rare for a girl I like to come along anyway. Any thoughts or ideas?      Here's another one of mine as well:    http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...

20090219223522AAOaFBd	Family & Relationships;Friends	Being Bullied, Please Help?	I just started college/secondary school and a boy in main class has decided to be very mean to me, calling me names and saying rude words to me.      Me and one of my friends were walking to my mums work and he walked past us and I said 'hi' being nice and he responded as f*** up d***.      I walk to mums work every friday and it takes 20 mins and there is nothing to do if I get into a difficult situation.      What should I do about him as its getting out of control, I don't really won't to tell a teacher cause he will just get even meaner. I have tried talking to him but it hasn't worked.

20090219223141AA6L0Bq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on time away from girlfriend?	that probably sounds worse than it is, but it is what i meant.   my girlfriend is in another state with family until next week, and she doesn't have time, or a phone to use, to call me.   I am not worried or anything, i completely trust her...but i have to say that it feels terrible to not be able to hear her voice. I was hoping some of you could give me tips on not missing her too much? yeah, it is kinda general, but try to keep it to us, not random activities.      also, is there anything special you think i should do for when she gets back? we will see each other monday at school (high school)?
20090219222034AAskRwK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, how mad does this usually make you?	I need to know, honestly, how mad does it make you when you catch a guy glancing at your boobs?  I am not talking about the pervert who is ALWAYS looking, but just glanced.  There is this girl who I have been talking to.  We are both in college, and both seem to like each other.  She started talking to me, actually.  I know she likes me just by the way she acts, occasionally brushing my shoulder in a flirty way and always smiling and making eye contact.  Today in class we were sitting right next to each other and she was wearing a...nice shirt.  She leaned forward to get a pencil and I could not help myself.  I seriously tried to say no but I could not.  I took a QUICK peek.  I did not move my head to get a great view, just quickly moved my eyes.  She popped up a lot quicker than I thought, and obviously caught me.  She did not really say anything, or act mad.  She did, however, act different the rest of the day.  She was quiet and never really looked at me the rest of class.  I am not the kind of guy to look at women like sex objects.  I am however, a guy, therefore I am bound to glance.  So do you usually get very offended by this, especially if it happened in these circumstances?
20090219223606AAanExp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you ask a girl out?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i've fallen in love with my friend. I fell in love with her the second i saw her 3 years ago. She is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and she's really smart. Whenever I see her I get weak at the knees & get butterflies in my stomach. She takes my breath away and whenever i see her i feel like i have to use all my strength to keep myself from kissing her. I lose all rational thought when I see her. We're in math class together and i can't keep my eyes off of her. Seeing her is the best part of my day. I've tried to ask her out but i freeze up every time. I've tried to ask her out everyday for the last 3 years. I've even tried doing it over the phone but I just freeze up when I try to ask her. I'm trying so hard to ask her but I just can't do it and its driving me crazy. She would be the perfect girlfriend/wife. I love everything about her & when ever i see her i always get lost in her eyes. I just cant resist that look in her eyes. and it so cute when she plays with her hair. I think she might like me but i'm not sure she keeps telling me that i'm really smart and she tells all of her friends and her parents that too. and sometimes she teases me and she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. and we've been studying together every week for math. and she said that she likes how i'm always there for her. I really want to be with her. I would b a good bf. I would adore her and shower her with kisses all the time. Her kiss has to be like heaven. I've fallen in love with her and I want to marry her. My life would be perfect if i had her. Meeting her was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I think about her day & night. my grades are slipping b/c i'm constantly daydreaming about her in class. not being able to ask her out is driving me crazy. And whats even worse is that she is going out of state for college. I know I have to ask her but I can't get the words to come out. Not knowing if she wants me is unbearable but I can't get myself to just ask her. I just can't stop thinking about her. I know that she is my true love and soul mate I just know it. I have to have her. She's the first girl I've ever liked or even had a crush on. I wish she knew how much I love her. It's just so hard to ask her out and I need to know how. How do you ask a girl out?

20090219221049AAXgpHS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do with my feelings.?	I still like my ex boyfriend, we only dated for 2 months but liked each other for 4 months.  He broke up with me because of some issues we've been having.  It was always unclear to us whether we were in a relationship.  I always thought we were just dating then he'll say were in a relationship.  It was crazy.  My friends constantly tells me stuff and believe them and do what they think I should do.  I broke up with him a couple of times because of some things he's done and then talk me out of it. He broke it off in the end and I was fine with it, even though it hurt me a lot.  I didn't chase after him for a month, i didn't do any ex-girlfriend psycho actions..  Then after a month of breaking up, we we on contact again as friends, I greeted him a Happy Birthday text.  This Valentines day he asked me to go hiking with him and i went.  It wasn't awkward, he would flirt with me and just stare at me.  I want to tell him I still like him but then I don't want to ruin the friendship we have now. I realize I still like him after I asked him if he dated someone else after me and he said yes, and it made me feel jealous.  How do I cope with this, is it good to tell him?

Then we went for a walk to fill up my drinkbottle and I said, "I really don't like it when you talk to him. Can you please stop?"      But she just said, "I don't HAVE to!"   I said, "But it's just weird. I really really like it if you stopped talking to him."   But she said, "No, he is really nice. I'm not going to stop talking to him."      I just left it at that and didn't say anything more.       So, what should I do?      I need urgent help here

(for the girls)?	ok, I know that this is kind of pathetic, and i know that everybody and their mother have already asked this question, but hear me out. I'm gonna try asking it a little different than most people would.      What is the "criteria" so to speak, of a guy that asks you out?       -how long does he have to have known you for?   -is it a lot better to ask you in person than it is to call you?   -is it good to act a little shy, or do you prefer boldness?   -(this one's important) does it matter to you what the guy's hobbies are, what he does and what kind of friends he has, or is his personality infinitely more important?      i know there are going to be different answers for every person, but all i'm trying to do is get kind of a general idea of how you guys think.       thanks!

20090219224351AAw8ayy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I heard this girl liked me so I asked her out and...?	we went out and got some drinks and went back to her place w/o sex but slept in the same bed and cuddled etc.  We left on good terms and now this week she has totally cooled off on me and says she has found someone else that she seems to think she is more compatible with.  I really don't care if she is dating someone else but I am just curious what I could have possibly done to turn her off this fast.  Most girls think that I am a very good looking guy and I almost always get compliments and girls hit on me when I go out.  I thought that I would be the one to end it with her just because I kind of asked her out not to be shallow.  The girl was actually very cute, just not really my type.  So I am just curious ladies what could I have possibly done to turn this girl off so fast since she is the one that originally had a crush on me?  I contacted her by phone and text at least a couple times after the date and everything but it definitely wasn't excessive.  Any thoughts??

I've been having sexual feelings towards girls since i was probly in 6th or 7th grade. I kissed a few of my girl friends at a party in 7th grade, but nothing has happened since then. I still have these feelings and my bf knows. He more than OK with it and understands that i have done stuff and still want to. I don't connect with girls on a relationship kind of level, but definitely sexual. I have no idea what to do. I get the worst urges and feelings that won't go away no matter what i do and i don't know how to get rid of them. I want to do more stuff with girls but idk if that will get rid of my feelings. Idk what to do.
20090219224227AAVfK1y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cant escape girl who wants me but i have a girlfriend help!!?	So I have a girlfriend now for over 4 years and I love her dearly.   Obviously as time goes on the passion level goes down.      So here is the problem:   In one of my late night classes there is this other attractive chick who always is telling me about how passionate her life is, how great she loves it, how she is single and always available, etc. (I will spare the details). She intentionally takes the same route home driving as me so we can "race" (even though I don't) She parks her car in the parking lot across campus so she can't walk b/c it is pitch black (our class ends at 10) so I have to give her rides to her car(I'm not going to let a woman walk alone late at night in the dark when 2 girls have been raped on campus in the last year). Long story short she wants me (like i said before i'm sparing a lot of details). I DO NOT want her I have a girlfriend. I consider cheaters to be the scum of the universe.       I have told the girl i am not interested.   I have explained to her that I have a girlfriend whom i love very much.   Yet she keeps at it.   I cannot drop the class, its not an option.      I also have the problem of being strongly physically attracted to her.       What can I do to help keep myself from cheating? or having unfaithful thoughts?

20090219221206AAwK4XD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I break the ice with the girl I like if were both sorta shy?were in 7 grade.?	I can talk to other girls but not her. And I guess she only talks if you talk 1. I have her in LA.I don't want to sound awkward because I've only talked to her once and its half the year. I know her friends more than I know her. We never get homework in the class but get asignments. She flippes her hair a lot. How do I break the ice?
20090219221306AARK5Ue	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do/say?! Help!?	okay so my ex & i have been off and on for about 5 months now, and we have been talking again. But sometimes he goes through phases were we hang out all the time, and then he just completely ignores me! So i get kind of nervous that whenever we start to talk again, he is just going to ignore me. Anyways so a week or so ago he was like "we should have sex" and i was like... are you just using me for sex? And he said "Omg Are you serious right now, i was just kidding!" So today he text'd me this morning and said "hey baby what's up" and stuff, and i asked if he wanted to hang out tonight...& all he said was "k"! wtf!!? Am i over reacting?? But anyways! So then i didn't reply to that and later on i said "we should have sex" as a total joke! and he hasn't said anything!! Should i text him and say by the way i was totally kidding about what i said... Or will i annoy him? i don't know what to do! Sorry this is so long, What should i do! Thank you SOOO much! :)

20090219222345AAuYkde	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about a  guy..awkward?	So, I moved at the beginning of the school year, and now there's a guy who I'm pretty sure likes me.  We've slow danced at a dance, but not really talked- only for hours online.  We flirt a lot online, but in person we only say like 2 or 3 words to each other..it's SO awkward. I can be really good at talking online, but I've never been great at having conversations with guys, or anyone really (besides close friends), in person.  The only chance we've had to talk is at lunch, but it's not really a good time to do it, so we kind of arranged to talk during a free period at school tomorrow.  I'm really nervous..I don't want the whole conversation to be awkward.     How can I avoid this?
