But my teacher said it was "disulfur trioxide"...... Why is that? Does the compound actually have to show the charge to be considered, and expressed as an ion???? I'm so confused! plz help!       The reason I'm asking this is because in another problem, I put PbSO4 as "lead (ii) sulfate" because it's a transition + ion....... and she marked it as correct, but the charge (-2) wasn't shown on the SO4 ion, so I don't understand what the difference between the S2O3 "not being and ion" and the SO4 "is an ion".............. please explain!!!! :-)

20090225122008AAmj6m1	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	I had a very strange and kind of scary experience. Does aural cleansing exist? What about spiritual cleansing?	First off, I am a very spiritual person and I believe that God has blessed some people with special abilities. I believe 100% in the paranormal.      That said, I was approached in a mall by a woman who said I had a black outer aura and that I had a lot of negativity surrounding me. She then went on to discuss things with me that had taken place in my life. I do believe she has abilities and is very much in touch with spirits, auras, energy. She said she was going to meditate for me to find out where the negativity is coming from. She did the meditation and had me meet with her to discuss her discoveries. She asked me to bring a grapefruit. She basically told me that there was so much negativity in my life that she needed to do more meditating to help me heal. She asked me to bring a grapefruit to the meeting. I did, and she then sat me on the floor and started reciting prayers and said that any negativity would manifest itself in the grapefruit. While I sat down, I heard her standing above me and it sounded like she was peeling the grapefruit slowly but I didn't pay any more attention. Then she rubbed it on my back and recited more prayers to pull the negativity from me. Once she was done, she asked me to step on the grapefruit. I stepped on the grapefruit to squash it. She picked it up and showed me a tiny snake (serpent she called) that was inside the grapefruit. Here's where I have a problem. I heard the citrus being pierced while I was on the ground and believe that she put the snake there. I don't believe it just appeared. However, I'm worried that what she did was some kind of spell or curse because I wasn't going to give her money.       I'm scared. How do I cleanse myself of this. All I wanted was clarity. Why do gifted people choose to take advantage for money? I understand making a living for survival, but what she asked for was $3,000. This is crazy, and I won't pay it. I just wonder if a curse was put on me. Help!

20090225122635AApxsMj	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Amateur Transformer question?	I've been reading about these Splashpad things (I cant give you a link because my question doesn't appear when i put it in). Its a device that you can leave other devices on top of to charge them. Works under the same principle as transformers do. Apparently when its powering a device it can be over 90% efficient. I was wondering if when you take the device being charged off the Splashpad would it still use up the same amount of energy or does it only use energy when the inductive load is placed on top?      I added transformer up there because it seems like the same thing as a transformer. ie the Splashpad is the primary coil and the device being charged is the secondary. So i was also wondering if you cut a transformer down the center (separate the primary from the secondary coil) and left it plugged in would it use the same amount of energy?      Thanks for your help!

Find the acceleration of each mass, and the size of the tension in the rope:      (Note: Make sure to find the general expressions first; this is an extremely important skill. Only after that, plug in the numerical values.)   For mass 1,  ax = ? m/s2 , ay = ? m/s2   For mass 2:  ax = ? m/s2 , ay = ? m/s2      T = ??? N   (Is it less, the same, or more than the weight of m2? Does this make sense?)      Checking limits: Using your general expression from above,   b.) if m1 was instead zero, what would be the acceleration of m2?   ax = ? m/s2 , ay = ? m/s2      c.) if m2 was instead zero, what would be the acceleration of m1?   ax = ??  m/s2 , ay = ?? m/s2      (Do your answers from part b/c agree with your intuition?)      d.)

I initially wanted to enroll for the Bachelor of Science majoring in Geology but the University rules are for Mature age students i had to enter through the Bachelor of Arts. So I think i have to stick it out in Arts for a while before changing. In the mean time I am thinking of picking the most relevant subjects in the Arts that i can find. They are Geography and Mathematics & Statistics, Do you think they are relevant?       Geography short Description:   Geographers study the natural or physical environment together with the activities of humans. Most importantly geographers study the impact of human activities on the environment and in this way the subject forms a bridge between the human and physical sciences.      Math: Mathematics is a very broad term which covers study and invention in applied and pure mathematics, and in theoretical statistics, all for their own intrinsic interest.      I think the Math is very relevant but was wondering if anyone had any advise or input. The idea is to do this then in a year (not sure if i can do it in less) change to a Bachelor of Science in Geology.      I have to pick up another 2 subjects for this first year to make my status "full time student" but i am not sure what to pick that would be relevant or helpful the list is:      ANTHROPOLOGY   ARCHAEOLOGY   ANCIENT HISTORY   ECONOMICS ENGLISH   PHILOSOPHY   POLITICAL SCIENCE      If you were in my shoes what other subjects would you pick to help you in the ultimate goal which is to be a geologist? If you have another idea or advise i need it.       Thanking you in advance very much      PS only serious answers pls.

20090226212433AABY21d	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	What are some ideas that are simple to help combat global warming?	Global warming is not only one of the most threatening environmental problems, but one of the greatest challenges facing all of humanity. Danger signs are surfacing worldwide as temperatures increase (the last ten years have been the hottest years ever recorded causing glaciers and the polar ice caps to melt, coastal areas to flood and storms to become more severe). If left unchecked, global warming will continue to have a profound impact on our planet that will eventually cause catastrophic results. Fortunately, there are things each of us can do. Buildings -- including our homes -- are major contributors to greenhouse gases they’re responsible for up to 40% of all energy and resource use and approximately 1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.

20090428130128AA7WTqr	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Why is medical education (to be a physician) so unbelievably long here in the United States?	I'm a 20 year-old college student whose parents once wanted him to be a doctor, but who flatly refused.      It wasn't because of finances or anything (I'm on a full-merit scholarship now, and wouldn't have an issue paying for any medical school), but the thing is it's SO LONG!      People that I know that live in Russia or in other countries can practice medicine in just three to four years, without going to undergraduate, and they have the same quality of treatment as US physicians.        But here in the US, it's 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of Medical School, THEN 3+ years of residency. (Not to mention the myriad of tests and licensing exams in between!)      So why is becoming a doctor so long here in the United States?      I calculated it out, and I wouldn't even start working full time as a doctor until I were 28! And to think of all the debts I'd accrue by then!

20090429124804AATdIJt	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I got this problem wrong, and I have no idea why.?	A jar of water weighs 10 pounds.  If half of the water is poured out, the jar weighs 5.5 lbs.  How much does the jar weigh?      I set up the problem with x=jar and y=water.  I set up a system of equations.      x+y=10   x-(1/2)y=5.5      I got x=7 and y=3.      how did I get this wrong?
20090429140826AAYghNV	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Is this conjecture always true?	If you bisect a line with a line extending from an angle oposite it is the angle split in the same ratio as the side? That question is somewhat confusing so say you have an equilateral triangle and a line from a vertex splits the opposite side into two segments, one three times the size of the other (1:3 length ratio). Would it be possible to say with certainty that the angle had been divided by that line into a three to one ratio i.e. (since equilateral triangles always have angle measures of 60 degrees) that the line had split it into two angles: one of 45 degrees and the other 15 degrees?

You have a set allele frequencies for wide(dominant) leaves - 37% and narrow(recessive) leaves - 63%. These represent p and q respectively.  How will allele frequencies change if there is a mutation and a new allele( we'll say 'h') for leaf width appears?  Will this just dilute the other allele frequencies?

I know i should be getting an answer somewhere in the 4.5billion years range, however my calculations keep giving me around 5.3 billion years.  the place i think i might be carrying my calculations wrong are in getting rid of the exponents...so far here is my calculations:      79.33 = (e^(lambda235Ut) - 1)/(e^(lambda238Ut) - 1)      after that, i narrowed it down to ln(79.33) = t(lambda235U - lambda238)      was that step possible? or did i miss something?

20090128114502AADhMNY	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Vacutainer Tubes Question?	When using Vacutainer Tubes, I understand there is a vacuum within the tube. So I have two questions:      1. If someone opened the tube BEFORE the draw, thus exposing the vacuum and whatever serum present, does this damage the Vacutainer's vacuum effect to draw blood?      2. I know a holder can be re-used, but in clinics and such, is it standard practice to reuse Vacutainer TUBES? I'd figure since the vacuum had been priorly exposed to air/environment, that this is not possible.
