AA11518036	Yes they sure do.|`|WUzCpuC5aa	yes they do.|`|oUd9ZIDLaa	It really depends on where you live|`|VXcp8hvHaa	yes|`|69bp1IMfaa	Rarely few do.|`|V5xHaIAcaa	unfortuantly, yes.    Hint:  you go to the buffet, take 5 slices,  go back to your table,   scrape the toppings of 4 of the slices,  put them on the 5th slice.    Take the other 4 slices and throw them under the table    REPEAT|`|XzScEyQZaa	Yes. look on their web site but I'm sure it's only around 6-7|`|NcufdPaAaa	Yeh they still do it!  Not sure how much..  About 5.99 i think?|`|7XIyslo5aa	Yeah! :D|`|GHd84xipaa	yes most Pizza Huts do a lunch time buffet.it depends on where you are located on the price.the one in Portsmouth,NH is around $7.00.|`|z48h5HRkaa	yes during lunch time for sure.|`|AaKTO3HRaa	yes pizza hut has their buffet still. I go about once a month. I've notice that not all Pizza hut's have it so check with your local one.|`|7adzqyGgaa	yea on wedsday|`|bnXhtB5baa	Yee in some places!!      x|`|xBxAD5NZaa	yess they do|`|3qUA5V3Saa	Yeh its only on at lunch though and you can either have pizza and pasta/salad for 5.99 or just pizza for 4.99|`|TX9aDNekaa	They sure do    I don't go there much myself, though when I do I think they have a pretty good range of foods to choose from.   If your not sure where your closest Pizza Hut with a Buffet is [as some may JUST be takeaway stores] then flip open up a phone book, and take a look there :)
MbtCFJbAaa	I found this on the internet:    Ingredients:  Sprite   Orange Juice   Cherry flavoring syrup   Ice cubes     Steps:  Put a handful of ice cubes in a cup.   Fill the cup about 3/4 way up with Sprite.   Squirt in a tablespoon or so of cherry syrup.   Fill the cup up the rest of the way with orange juice.   Stir with a straw and enjoy!|`|VXcp8hvHaa	me not know

Some people's answers are really rude.  Could you have the kids go to a friend/family member's house for a night? Then you could light some candles and make him a nice dinner. I'm sure it would be a pleasant surprise to come home from work and walk into a kid-free house with something cooking!  Or you could make him a nice picnic with wine and go to a beach or nice park.  It might be nice just to go to dinner and then to a nice quiet bar. Act like you're dating again!  I think it's really nice you want to do something for him =)

The pizza was 95 percent dough, and 5 percent mediocre toppings.    I went to the bar, picked up some pizza, scrapped off the toppings and put them onto a single slice of pizza, at the rate of 5 to 1.  I then took the "scrapped pieces" and threw them under the table.    An I proud of what I did?  Heck no.  In my defense, I would much rather have paid twice as much for the buffet and gotton some real food, that is, something better than pig swill...so maybe I do not feel that bad afterall.  If you going to rip me off, you (Pizza Hut) better get much more original.    Try Wendy's ... at least you get some value for your dollar

05d05342b340961643a18c3d866ab89baa	I love hot coffee. My sister in law used to get coffee out of the pot and put it in the microwave because it wasn't hot enough. I like coffee extremely hot and tea extremely cold.|`|zFb022Iiaa	What I did notice is that they are way to expensive.  Already promised someone one so I got it, but heck it was as much as starbucks.

TX9aDNekaa	McGriddles?    Sorry we don't have that Mcdonalds product in my country lol
VXcp8hvHaa	If you would have really got a job there, they would have told you what they pay, they would have given you your uniforms and told you your duties. You are welcome.|`|WPNN8z08aa	What?  You just got a job, and you don't even know what they are paying you?      Tips are a huge part at Golden Corral.  Dress Code-they should provide you a shirt and then you need pants (black I believe).    Yes, they are friendly from what I've seen and I've eaten there a dozen times.
OBOAPOg1aa	Buffets all the way man. I have a very large family (not in the sense of stomach size) and when you go to a buffet there is a lot larger variety to chose from. Also you don't have to worry about one persons order getting forgoten or taking longer to cook than everyone elses, and the bill is a lot easier to figure out if one person is not paying for everyone.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	I normally only can eat one plate full so a buffet is a waste|`|W8UZebRWaa	Yeah I like Golden Corral b/c they have good food and its always a fun time.  Cici's pizza is never a good time b/c I can't stand their pizza but if your broke then its alright|`|I14OzlGpaa	I think buffets are a great choice because buffets usually will have something for everyone vs. going to a specific restaurant.    I don't like Chinese but my parents do.  Some people don't like Pizza or Mexican, but a buffet offers a wide variety. I think every buffet I've been  to has had enough of a variety to fill everyone sense of taste!|`|oPRmgyXzaa	yes, and golden corral is a fave!|`|10AvUf8Jaa	I like the food and the prices for what you can get, however, I am a germaphobe, so I have to use hand sanitizer if I go back and get more food.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, we do enjoy eating at a buffet.  Everyone has different preferences, so it's the best place at a reasonable price.  Most everyone in our family is a "big eater", especially the kids.  LOL.|`|2lMP6ow1aa	I like restaurants better than buffets. Restaurants are usually a more relaxed setting and a better place to enjoy time with your family or friends. Buffets are usually full of families with kids pitching fits and the service isn't usually as good|`|0dd0cKUGaa	I always love buffets but that might be because I am a "fat kid" in a little body.|`|AA10250709	Depends.  If its just casual, buffets work well for breakfast--since there will be such a great variety.    Generally, I'd prefer a menu to order from and just sit and enjoy the conversation.     PS...Golden Coral and CiCi's are horrid. SO busy and full and hectic.  Not the atmosphere I want when dining out.  I'd rather spend a few extra bucks for better quality food and less chaos.|`|79c9dc74d3c2dbf1817a9346923a19d7aa	nope...because if i eat too much or get up too many times, I'll feel akward.|`|JGkYyIhJaa	don't mind but incline more to restaurants|`|Kc8sFjwraa	I love going to Golden Corral and Pizza Inn for their buffets    I have been to CiCi's an few times w/ my church group and it was OK rather have Pizza Inn|`|uumASbKbaa	I don't care for buffets because the quality of the food is usually poor.

Although I'm not a crew trainer myself I'd say you'd be introduced on how to show a new person around and what you should be expected to show them.  At my Mcdonalds, after a while we get graded on how well we do well on a certain area [whether this is the front counter/d-thru/grill area] and we are always rated by a crew trainer.  Crew Trainers are expected to:  -Follow all rules, be an example to other crew and be there to help new people  -Wear the uniform correctly  -Clean as you go/stock and help customers with problems    :) I'm sure the training course will be great. You'll probably be asked to watch a video or fill and read some papers  xx

pueeMH6gaa	Picture being dropped suddenly into the deepest hottest corner of hell where demons torment you with pitch forks and you are suffering so much it's unbearable.  Working at any sub shack is worse than that.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it's like wow man
Kc8sFjwraa	Tacos sound good w/ all the fixings :)    Good luck|`|VXcp8hvHaa	tacos!|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Tacos|`|oPRmgyXzaa	fajitas, and it would  be great!
JfVxCDb7aa	Yes , they are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE, the entire menu is good and their fries are the best. Hopefully they'll brach out to californea.|`|yvtGL6RTaa	ive wondered the same thing about washington|`|W8UZebRWaa	Oh Daryl let me tell you. You don't want them. I'm serious. The frozen ones are much better.  The onion chips are good and the Red Cream soda but the burgers are too expensive. 2 hours later your doubled over in stomach cramps and the next day your poo smells just like them.  Crystals are better, they are the samething but they have mustard.  I go to White Castle a few times a year b/c they taste alright but the samething happens everytime.|`|JGkYyIhJaa	hey you mean Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is REAL   someone please tell me the nearest to California!!|`|pueeMH6gaa	Doesn't California have enough problems?|`|sDr86x4waa	The only way this happens is if California shares In N Out Burger with states that have White Castle locations,and I am not sure I am ready to do that.
