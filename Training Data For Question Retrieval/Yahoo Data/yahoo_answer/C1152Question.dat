20090307172302AAeLUBN	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	What type of flower(s) would go well with a koi?	My husband has a hardhat that has been spray painted, and he asked me to paint a koi or two on it. I have drawn up the koi and the water but im at a loss as to what kind of flower or flowers to put on it. I was thinking a few cherry blossoms, but then I looked up the meaning of them and it said something to the effect of "feminine power" or something. My husband is not feminine, haha.      What do you guys think? If you are able, please include pictures.      P.S. This is in the tattoo section because I figured that people with koi tattoos would be able to help me out a little better than someone in the drawing section.

I like to keep my legs and bikini area nicely shaved for me and my boyfriends sake, but I find that if I don't wait until the hairs are quite long (at LEAST a weeks growth), my skin, especially in the bikini area, gets irritated and just doesn't shave as well opposed to waiting before I shave. I HATE waiting for this! Is there any way to make that irritated skin go away when I "re-shave"?

20090307181650AAGDN4X	Beauty & Style;Hair	Do aussie products work on straight/Asian hair?	I have a couple of friends that use aussie products and I wanted to try it out too. But I wanted to know some things first.   1) Do they work on straight hair because all my friends who use it have curly hair and most of their product descriptions say things like "lock those locks" or "give some shine/volume to your locks". Most of them don't mention straight hair, so I was wanted to know that.   2) Also I know that Asian hair is different from Caucasian hair because, again, my friends are Caucasian. I've also heard that it doesn't work as well on Asian hair and I wanted to know if that was true.   So thanks in advance :]

During week 2-3 it was doing just fine so I decided that I could start doing oral with my bf. The next day my lip was swollen and it hurt a bit, now its horrible! My lip is really fat, it really hurts whenever touched, the inside of my lip piercing has a bit of puss coming out, its really purple inside and it looks like the hole where the piercing is ,is a bit bigger- kind of like a small gash rather than a hole.      I've been washing it with salt water the whole time.   I am guilty of touching the ring a few times without sterilized hands.   I've seen the piercer when the first signs of bruising and swelling appeared but told me, "Its just healing." Which I think is bullshit.   I don't have a webcam but I did do a drawing on paint xD so yea take a look if you don't quite understand what it looks like,    http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a100/da...

20090227093841AAR4keL	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	I'm going to have my first tattoo?	next month, when i come of age. i've already decided the design: it's a swallow, 6x4,5 cm. the problem is where!    after a long selection, i must decide: ankle, foot, or lower stomach, near my pelvis bone. the problem of this last placement (the one i like the most) is that if i'll be pregnant i'm afraid skin will overstretch and my tattoo will be damaged forever :(   it's not a question of pain, it doesn't matter at all.i just want to know which is the right placement in that zone that doesn't involve the stretching of skin during pregnance. is it better groin?or just the pelvis bone itself?

Okay, I'm going to get a bridge piercing done professionally in a few days but I'm not sure if they'd do it if I come in with a full face of makeup (concealer, foundation, powder on top). Like they'd probably think I'd be wearing lots of makeup on/around it after i get it pierced (WHICH I WOULDNT DO bc i dont want an infection). Idontcare if they wipe off lots of it around the area before they pierce it.. but I'm too self-conscious to not wear the face makeup when I go there.          Soo the question is if anyone else wears full face makeup &was still able to get a facial piercing. :)

See, i Own two pairs of 511's and they aren't tight as i thought, it tight at the thigh at most, and some Super Skinny jeans from Hot Topic, and some Rude skinny jeans, but they all are too loose..  would i  have to alter them  to be as tight as i want, or do they sell some jeans some where that are really skinny?

20090307165849AAx12Pd	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is there something wrong with me?	Hi,   Im still a teenager growing up in a world where you are told how to look beautiful and that you have to be skinny to be beautiful.      Lately i brought about $700 worth of MAC makeup and $250 of hair extensions (clip ons). I like to take nice pictures of myself to make me feel good from other people who bullied and teased me and thought that im always "The fat mean *****".   After buying all the stuff i dont feel any more beautiful i haven't taken pictures because i just know that i cant get a good picture.   What is wrong with me? i mean i get excited about buying that stuff but when i have it, and it doens't work out as i hoped, i feel like it was such a waste of money when i should be saving my money instead of spending it.   I dont know how to explain it, i want to look great in an outfit so i buy all theses things like accessories to look good and like i brought 3 rings from diva cost me $32 and i will proberly hardly wear them.      I think i just buy stuff to impress other people rather than being me. i've always been the girl who copied other people coz i wanted to be like them so much and now i dont think i'll ever be beautiful or nice until im stick thin.
