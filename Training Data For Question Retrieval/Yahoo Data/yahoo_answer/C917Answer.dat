RNqRnG86aa	The maximum amount you are going to be able to borrow is the percent of monthly income that you will have available to pay the mortgage, insurance and taxes.<br>  <br>  Income, insurance expense and taxes are all going to change as time moves on. However a banker is going to look at the current snapshot of your monthly income, monthly insurance premium and the monthly taxes you have to pay. They are usually shooting for no more than 33% of your income being used to pay for housing.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	every year you own your house, especially when you have a mortgage, unless you want to lose everything you own in a fire and not be able to replace it|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	You have to have homeowners insurance for the life of the loan.<br>  <br>  After the mortgage is paid off the homeowner is not required to keep homeowners insurance.    But the mortgage company requires homeowners insurance to protect their investment as long as the customer has the loan.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	While you have a mortgage your home must be insured as required by the lender. Homeowners insurance is almost always paid annually. While it is very wise to always have homeowners insurance once you have paid your home off and own it free & clear there is no law that says you must have it.|`|AA10405438	Homeowner's insurance is a forever kind of thing.  As long as you own the home you will pay insurance.  The length of time the loan is will determine the amount of insurance paid.  If it's a 30 year loan, the cost of insurance must be figured into the equation.
L4rlu2BDaa	Yes they can recover the money, you had arrears on the car so they are legally entitled to claim the arrears, plus charge and interest on these arrears. <br>  <br>  They can also claim any outstanding balance from the sale of the car, for example if the car was worth ￡10,000 when you took out the credit, you paid off ￡3000 and then handed the car back. The car then only sold for ￡5000, you are still responsible for any outstanding balance on the car meaning the ￡2000 the car people lost. A car never sells for what you paid for it, ever hear the saying the car loses value as soon as you drive it off the car lot? This is very true, a 3 year old car is only likely gonna be worth maybe half what you originally agreed to pay for it.<br>  <br>  simply giving back the car doesn't put you in the clear, you still owe any outstanding balance on the car plus any charges and interest. A company has 6 years to claim this money back from you, they will leave it a year becasue they know interest has built up so they can get more from you and this is very legal.|`|fvkbwtPSaa	Unless you made every payment on time until the car was sold, yes.<br>  <br>  People don't seem to grasp that handing the car back does not cancel interest on outstanding payments, and that owners of car (property does not transfer until payment is made in full) have a right to enforce ALL terms of the contract, which is usually weighted very much in favour of the finance company.
Pjm9pg7iaa	At some time in your life you will decide not to be a renter. The house will be yours and yours alone. Once you decide that, you will have to get a loan. They are easy to obtain. Just a 2 page application: how much in the bank, how long on the job, how much income, good credit. 30 days later a check for the loan will be delivered.<br>  The administrative fees buy "something".  Only you can decide if those things are of value to you.<br>  In the past people would have smiled at your question. Who cares if you pay double the price of the house if the house goes up in value by 5 times what you paid. Now we have to reconsider that idea..|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	your rent ( and starta fees-whatever they are) will go up every year and at the end you 30 yrs, you can be kicked out on the street with nothing to show for it. when you buy a house - you will eventually OWN it - in a rental, you can't do renovations or paint without the OWNERS permission|`|AA11616170	Your homeloan will only be twice the price of the house if you take the agreed 30 years to repay.  Every bit extra you can pay reduces the balance and also the amount in interest due.  And it is your own in the end, unlike when you rent.<br>  <br>  I had a 30 year mortgage, which I had a closer look at after 12 years.  By then wages were higher, and by paying the agreed amount weekly instead of monthly, I cleared it in 5 years. Just make sure your mortgage agreement allows you to pay in more if you want to.  <br>  <br>  I'd prefer to buy a house than an apartment, and skip the admin/strata fees altogether.|`|VYCLwKwNaa	For the cheap place, high fees/ expensive place, low fees question, you have to do the math. How long do you plan on living there? You can add the payments and the fees for each for that length of time and see how they compare. One thing to think about is, will the low fees still stay low, or is there a chance that they could be increased in a year or two?<br>  The reason that you end up paying twice, or more, for the home loan, is that you are paying gobs of interest on the money that you borrowed. A way to avoid that is to either put down a bigger down payment, or to get a loan that allows you to repay it faster. Many people who have this kind of loan make extra payments that are applied to the principal of the loan and pay it down faster. Not all lenders allow this, so you will have to check on it. <br>  <br>  As you know, the bottom has dropped out of the real estate market in some places. So, for a careful buyer, bargains can be found. On the other hand, if you buy something now, and then want to sell in a few years, you may not be able to sell it for what you paid. Which means you lose money. <br>  <br>  So, you have to think this through pretty carefully:<br>  Can you afford to make the payments now?<br>  Is your job secure?  If you lose your job, you could also lose your home. Or, you may have to move.<br>  Do you plan on staying in this location for a long time, over 7 years?<br>  If you moved, what kind of rent could you get, and what kind of renters could you get? Would the rent be enough to make the payments?<br>  Do you feel like this housing is in a good neighborhood that will increase in value over time, or are there places in the area that are empty and run-down?<br>  How much rent would you be paying compared to the home payments, including taxes and fees and maintenance?<br>  If you didn't buy the place, what would you be doing with the money?<br>  Why do you want to buy? Is it to save money, or for another reason, such as investment, or the freedom to have a pet, etc.?<br>  Once you have more information, you can make a more informed decision. A realtor can give you some info, but they want to sell something. Ask a banker or realtors that are not in your area for advice, too.<br>  There are deals to be had, but be very careful. These are tricky economic times and no one can predict when or how things will get better. They may get far worse before they improve.|`|XDZWXiLuaa	You have to remember that when buying a home sometimes the monthly payment isn't the expense that gets people in trouble.  Don't forget all the other expenses you have with owning a home.  They all add up and can easily surpass your mortgage payment:  Here are some I can think of off the top of my head.<br>  <br>  <br>  Taxes - Property, personal property<br>  Assessment - Water and sewer, street improvements, sidewalks etc.<br>  Insurance - Home owners, must have in you have a mortgage<br>  Maintenance - the deep hole, never ending, everything your father warned you about!<br>  <br>  Here is a website with some great free information about real estate, it helped me out when I was researching it.|`|ixHwF4apaa	do not think how much you pay twice or thrice the value<br>  just think the value of the money at that time.<br>  just the interst portion for the money you borrowed<br>  just think the repayment  as the rent for your house, and atlast you own it<br>  how my answer is<br>  praise me please if you feel
MbN3YTEQaa	It's hard to find work, and it makes it all the more difficult when you realize that most (roughly 80%) of open positions are not advertised. Meaning, if you're only applying on huge job sites (Monster, Career builder, Yahoo), not only are you applying for a job that 200 other people clicked on to apply for, but you're not even seeing the majority of the jobs out there.<br>  <br>  Think about companies that you would really want to work for, do some research on them, check out their website for the application process, then form a well thought out (and detailed specifically to each company) cover letter. Inquire about any open positions that fit your qualifications and really impress them by even tailoring your resume to each company as well. It's time consuming, but well worth it. If a company is putting out a position internally, yet you give them a really great resume and cover letter, now you might be able to snag an interview. (Sidenote: I recommend doing the snail mail approach, and not emailing them your resume/cover letter. Yours will stand out more because someone will have to physically open and hold your resume, instead of just a few clicks).<br>  <br>  Hopefully you find something you enjoy soon!|`|RyYV3aXlaa	yeah I know how you feel.......we're in the same boat...|`|K4H70kYZaa	Its definately not because you're too old!  LOL  The problem is, there's very few jobs out there right now and hundreds of people applying for each job opening.  Just keep trying.  Attend job fairs, get your resume listed on the big online employment sites (ie: Monster, CareerBuilder, etc), do cold calling.  A job is not going to land in your lap, you have to probably work harder to GET the job now than you will once you do get it.  Good luck.
83844defcdcb7e19fa8aea7dad5a5561aa	The absurdly higher minimum is just their way of forcing you out.<br>  <br>  If you quit,  you will not be eligible for unemployment compensation;  so I suggest you stay and if you do not make the minimum, they will lay you off.  If you are let go, you qualify for unemployment.<br>  <br>  Going back to school is a good option if you can afford it, and if the field you are going to study is relevant to your interest and what you want to do in future.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	I would start looking around at other companies. If things don't work out either with your present company or a new one then I would go back to school. By the time you graduate the economy should be better.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	It is impossible to give reliable advice based on the information presented.  It seems to me that you must move from the small town. There is limited organic growth potential in those family towns.  If I understand correctly you could be a token employee to keep your license as a financial advisor active.   I would take the steps to keep your license active.  Then, move to a region of the U.S. that has a stronger economic future.   Candidly,  the small town job choice is the largest negative in your career profile. A return to school is one that I would consider if I could obtain an advanced degree in 18 calendar months.

I would consider renting your house. For 1k a month you would probably be able to pay off the whole house in 18 months, thats only a year and a half, after that all the money you make you can pocket. It becomes a great source of supplemental income. If you sold it now for about the 15k you'd be making in my opinion thats a worse investment than holding onto it for another year and a half, because after that you may be able to up the rent some, and youll have made 15k back on a paid off house in no time!<br>  <br>  up to you though<br>  <br>  GL|`|Vzy5mpDIaa	Selling would be the best in the long run.<br>  You mentioned taxes e.t.c for renting, and you're right, they are an absolute pain in the behind.|`|fuN8BZp9aa	Sell it absolutely! <br>  Renting out a house is a big job and not worth the hassle. <br>  Congrats on your 30K profit!|`|0jnILvY2aa	i would sell the house and because u would earn some money|`|tdfRsB48aa	I say rent it...it'd provide a steady income for the long term and can only really go up in value after a few years.

Instant gratification has become the norm and look where it's gotten us as a country.People who relied on credit to live didn't worry about anything but the monthly payments, then they have a setback and suddenly realize they owe thousands of dollars and have no reserves to live on until things change. The creditors start calling and eventually you end up being sued and a judgment filed or your wages garnished.

Or if you can't find one of these accounts, get a card only savings account. cut up the card so you can't access the money. You can then ask for a new card once you ahve all the money you need!

Should they be able to sue you?|`|zw3U581daa	Your first step is fire this lunatic. Just because he says he's a lawyer, remember this: Graduating doesn't mean you know what the heck you're doing.<br>  <br>  You could have done this yourself, and now it appears it's going to be your best move yet.  Gather all the papers you have for your debts (your vehicle is not an unsecured loan, it's secured by your vehicle).<br>  <br>  Step one, contact the court clerk, in person if at all possible and let them know you do not want to file at this time.  If your paperwork isn't in order, they aren't going to do anything anyway.<br>  <br>  Step Two, Sit down and total up all your bills. You aren't interested in interest rates and all that, at this point it's irrelevant. What is your net income per month?  After all deductions including taxes is your net income. <br>  <br>  Take out rent/mortgage payments, utilities (you may have to give up cable and the cell phones for a while to get back on your feet).  What's left?  That is the maximum you can pay on your bills. Period, no questions asked and no 'hoping' for raises or bonus money.  This is the amount you have to work with to pay off your debt.<br>  <br>  Step Three, bite the bullet and call every single one of your creditors.   Find out if they have someone who can work with you to make payment arrangements.  You may run into those who have outsourced this part of their business to India or some other country, try anyway.  <br>  <br>  Step Four, be willing to give up something to get what you want.  You may be forced to give up cable and your cell phone services.  Use basic cable and a prepaid phone if need be, but at least be willing to do what it takes.  <br>  <br>  Credit cards can be cutup, don't send them to the companies.  You are training yourself to use cash for purchases and separating needs from wants.  Many times after you've made regular payments on your agreement with the credit card companies, they will offer you a 'pay out' balance.  <br>  <br>  What this means is you pay less than what you actually owe but you can not use those cards while under the payment arrangement. <br>  <br>  Now, with all this if the companies are being hard-nosed about working with you, you still have the option of filing bankruptcy.  Look in the yellow pages or use the link below and find a paralegal service in your area.  They will help you complete all the paperwork and you take them to court yourself.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and we've all been where you are.

61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	I think in any village it will cause resentment.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	You will find some resentment in villages all over the country and not just from what someone called "old bigots".  It is a fact that people moving into villages from the big cities have pushed house prices up, often out of the reach of local people.  The village properties were low priced by city standards for a very good reason, they were/are situated in low wage areas. <br>  <br>  I live in a rural village - am i an old bigot?  No, i am one of the culprits who helped push the prices up.  I worked in a big city and one day realised that i was paying a hefty mortage on a property that had a substantial equity in it, sold my house and the equity enabled me to buy a similar property in a village within commuting distance for cash.<br>  That was nearly 20 years ago, now about 60% of the people in the village are ex city dwellers who did the same as i did. yes, we have unintentionally pushed the prices up beyond the local wage levels. Yes there is some resentment, but far less than you would expect.  It is now more like resigned acceptance.|`|6J90RE52aa	I don't know about Yorkshire, but I do know about Cornwall, and its the same principle.<br>  Here the "upcountry" people have come in, used there upcountry wages to buy up the local properties that have become available and caused the people who live there to have to move out of their own villages.<br>  How would YOU feel it that happened to you?<br>  Yes, EXACTLY !|`|13426e9f69959387564aa9ca0f73fcf7aa	Yes but it's mostly the old bigots that are set in their ways and can't see the world changing around them cos they're too busy watching Emmerdale lol..Sorry.

Should your recordkeeping not be sufficient, you will be bombarded with endless  so-called freebie offerings.  And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new candidates to this program.  So, if you do not want to keep strict track of such offerings and do not have others to recommend, then the overall pay per hour for all your survey taking may prove to be of little value for all your efforts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA10464818	You can use pay per click advertising in the search engines to reach audiences looking for your products. You can use Google Adwords <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/adwords</a> or Yahoo <a href="http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com">http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com</a><br>  <br>  Here are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: <br>  <br>  1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.<br>  <br>  2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends.

Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche.

Can anyone assume that your domain name is a major recognizable "brand" name.  And if it not a major brand then replace the domain name entry with more generic descriptive keyword entries.  And where's the rest of your metatags, i.e., <description> and <keywords>... they are simply missing in action.<br>  <br>  As for the initial design [in flash], who decided on your viewing audience:  since strictly DSL net surfers only represent 20% of the U.S. net population whereas there is still a majority or 80% of your audience who are on dial-up analog connectivity that cannot wait for the long downloads of flash files and therefore they simply do not open your website.  Perhaps a redesign is in order for a pure HTML website sans the flash files.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, your photography is top drawer!<br>  <br>  In the meantime, here's a help tutorials from Google about placement design of your metatags:<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BgwnPBVoaa	You should have some good content and keywords which can help you to be more seo friendly.<br>  <br>  Here's some techniques as well to boost traffic up., Hope you find it useful!, Write something great about your niche and email other bloggers to, let them know – there’s a good chance they’ll link to you, <br>  <br>  Have a signature link in forums that points to your site, Post links to your pages to social bookmarking sites.<br>  <br>  Add an RSS subscribe button/link in a high profile spot on your site<br>  Add a mailing list subscribe form in a high profile spot on your site, Add a bookmark this site link in a high profile spot on your site<br>  Use a Tell A Friend Script on your site so people can email their friend about an article on your website.<br>  Submit a blog to a blog directory, Buy links to your site, Buy reviews about your site on other people’s site, Buy banner space on other websites if you can get a good ROI<br>  Send articles to ezine publishers with a link back to your website<br>  Do a big viral push for a piece of link bait, post it in forums, social bookmarking sites like digg, email bloggers, and get a few people to vote for you on social bookmarking sites – this little push could start a viral chain reaction!<br>  Have a link to your site on community sites like MySpace and FaceBook.<br>  <br>  Well, These are effective tasks but only if you have an professional way to this.

If you fail to pay rent you are in breach of contract and could be subject to court action.|`|TKDi70uTaa	no, it does not work like that. landlords rarely give deposits back and will find any small reason to keep the deposit. you may have a decent landlady who might return your deposit at the end of the tenancy but i doubt she will let you use it as a rent payment.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Depends on your lease. If it's a security deposit: No, unless your landlady agrees.<br>  <br>  However, if you did something like pay first month's rent, last month's rent, and a security deposit prior to moving in, then you have already paid the last month's rent.<br>  <br>  Read your lease carefully.

There's not a better place to do banking than with large financial institutions like Bank of America, Citibank and Chase.<br>  <br>  Citi is still in good shape.

DorePwVOaa	Yes, they can put things on your credit report before you turn 18. But, if this is a checking account (which it sounds like it is), it likely won't go on your credit report, but on something else called your ChexSystem Report. It's similar to a credit report, but it's for checking accounts. Other banks will look at it whenever you want to open a bank account with them. So it could still cause problems for you.<br>  <br>  Make sure you talk to Bank of America, either in-person at your local branch, or over the phone. Make sure they know what your situation is and that you're trying to make good. Make sure they make a note of this in your account information.

The child that is not his natural, step, or adopted child does NOT qualify.<br>  <br>  If he claimed the ineligible child for the past 3 years the IRS will review those years when they disallow the claim for this year and he will have to pay back the EIC that he improperly claimed.  It's also very likely that he will be barred from any EIC claims for 2 to 10 years.<br>  <br>  He obviously didn't bother to read the instructions on claiming the EIC.  If he had, he would have known that he could not claim the child that was not his.  IRS Pub 596 is very explicit on this when it defines what is a qualifying child and what is not.  <br>  <br>  About all that he can do is file amended returns for all years that he claimed the child improperly for the EIC and pay the money back.  If he does that before the IRS completes their review he MIGHT escape the ban on future EIC claims but don't bet on it.  The IRS is coming down hard on improper EIC claims.|`|f5f29f78cbffd9771950da5ad0141cafaa	If I were you, I would amend the previous years ASAP and be prepared to pay back the IRS. They have a payment plan that you can arrange. <br>  Don't be too fearful, you can only claim 2 children for EIC, so if he had one child then he will only qualify for a portion of the EIC credit he received.

Don't trust the IRS.

If you plan to pay the money you should file the returns ASAP to minimize interest.  And try to get the penaties waived.  There is a chance they will not go back looking into past years.<br>  <br>  Mostly you should find out what under review means.  It is possible someone else claimed that as dependents and they need to investigate that.  And once that quick investigateion is done they will close it and be done.

Then all the other kids would follow.<br>  Creative means doing what no one else is doing or has done..|`|st3qnhETaa	A type of sales position where the primary emphasis is on generating new business|`|uoj6GoLxaa	Whether you sell a product, provide a service or are a politician - your success depends on how well you understand and implement the dynamics of Creative Selling. There are basically three types of selling . . . charismatic, classical and creative.<br>  <br>  In charismatic selling, you become part of the value along with the product or service. A person buys because he/she likes you. The exact same product or service may be had from many sources but because the individual connects with you, they will purchase from you. You become an important part of the sale as you add worth and assurance.<br>  <br>  Classical selling is selling benefits, value, uniqueness, product or service as a problem solver. The buyer sees the product or service as filling a need, and buys that resolve. They will hardly remember the salesperson. The byers objective is in fulfilling their need no matter who the sales person is. .<br>  <br>  Creative selling is simply the art of allowing the prospect to sell himself/herself. You just act as a guide in the process. Pointing out those things that the prospect finds most stimulating. You help the prospect build a mental picture so he/she can see himself/herself using, and enjoying its benefits. Help the prospect to focus on the product so he/she may experience the feeling of ownership. Give the prospect an awareness of the relationship between your product and the "good life" that he/she longs for. Turn the product into a living, breathing, vital thing.<br>  <br>  Creative selling is more than a few words. It's a continuous process of letting the prospect know that his/her welfare is very important to you. No matter what you sell, you must be less concerned with the product than you are with the prospect. Forget about how much you are going to make on the sale, that's a result of you doing your job right. The only thing of importance is the prospect -- and the filling of his/her desires.<br>  <br>  A few simple rules can guide you toward the goal of creative salesmanship - and do wonders for your pocket book.<br>  <br>  know the product - the better you know the product the better you can relay its benefits and engage the prospect in it.<br>  <br>  Know your market - where can you find new markets for your product? Are there any new uses for it? Are you selling to the right demographics?<br>  <br>  Know your prospects - are you filling the prospects needs? Are you addressing his/her concerns?<br>  <br>  Know what you are going to say - before you talk to the prospect, prepare your presentation and know just how you're going to present it. Know the answers for every stall or objection the prospect will bring up. Great athletes practice and practice and practice, until they master the game. You must commit yourself to being a master of salesmanship.<br>  <br>  Know you're going to close the sale - feel in your mind that the prospect needs what you are offering and that he/she will buy it. See yourself fulfilling the customers needs. Embrace the customer and his/her desires as your own. Be thankful and happy you are part of their buying experience.

The stuff you stole is probably only worth $20 if you do. <br>  <br>  Next time you decide to steal from them, use your Albertson's card and get the savings.

eACZ1Rhjaa	You can sue for specific things. You may have trouble proving the merchandise wasn't a gift. You should have take your things when you left of not let her take them when she left.|`|XxUsLqXRaa	I think I'd be more inclined to take the money and pay off the credit card, or go buy another ginormous TV.  You COULD ask the judge to simply award you your TV back, but do you really want to risk getting it back in 1000 pieces?  The judge could even specify that she give it back in the current condition that it is in, but if you get it back with a shotgun hole in the screen, you'd be very hard-pressed to prove that it wasn't there BEFORE the judge made his ruling.  If you win the case, you'll have 2 pissed-off people that you're trusting to return to you a high-dollar TV without first taking out some sort of aggression on it.  Show up to court with the receipt for the TV to prove you bought it,  and copies of the credit card statements to prove you're still paying on it.  Hard proof will always speak louder than hearsay....meaning that those receipts are more valuable than her simple verbal claim to the judge that it was a gift.  If she doesnt have the money but is willing to return the TV, ask her, in front of the judge, if it is still in working and functioning condition.  If she says "no it fell on the floor and is broken now" then it wont do you any good to get it back.  If she says "yes it still works fine" remind her later that those words were spoken in court, in front of the judge, so if the TV is returned in a condition worse than what she indicated in court, you'll sue her again....with the same judge presiding.|`|bb2cafcc1198c3f1dea9c78f472dc7e9aa	I believe you can just ask for your stuff and he'll have a day arranged to do so or she'll have so long to do it before she gets into trouble|`|oDqdqLyNaa	Yeah you can do that.<br>  Go: <a href="http://locate-power-of-attorney.info/" rel="nofollow">http://locate-power-of-attorney.info/</a>  It's a site that has Lawyers subscribed to it.<br>  It's free to do and V easy

bFDeOXvYaa	A part-time job where you have to leave the house won't take your money. Retail work or call centre work is good and can have flexible hours. Since you are home-schooling your children though that may be too difficult.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest learning self-defence, getting a safe (keeping some money and gold there in case there is a run on the banks!), keeping one weeks worth of canned food, learning basic survival skills.<br>  <br>  You may like to get involved in a bartering network. You can swap your and your kids old clothes for other peoples clothes, or give away baked goods in return for haircuts, etc.<br>  <br>  Recycle as much as possible. Buy goods that are easier to recycle. If you still menstruate you can buy or make washable re-usable pads or blood collector.<br>  <br>  Buy fresh food at Paddy's Markets and the fish markets.|`|DorePwVOaa	I would polish my skills and work extra hard at work.

And this is only temporary. Try to do the best you can until the situation ameliorates. Right now, the most important thing is your family. The love of your family will keep you strong.<br>  <br>  First you need to refrain from using the credit cards unless it's an emergency. Don't buy things that you don't need like caviar and diamonds. Start saving every penny. Since your husband is the sole income provider, you're making the right  choice  by homeschooling the kids. That's a saving right there. I don't know how many hours you spend doing that. It would be good if you could find  time for a part-time job to help with the groceries and other amenities. How about babysitting in your own home or teaching other kids? That's just an idea. <br>  <br>  Try to recycle. Don't buy new clothes unless it's necessary. Don't eat out. Rice and beans have amino acid and can save you money. If you have an extra room in your house, consider having a roommate, like a student who can help with the bills or another single mom. People are doing that now. Use coupons for shopping. You can save a lot with coupons. <br>  <br>  Prepare a budget and try not  go over it. That would really help  you to manage the money more efficiently. Try to do away with unnecessary expenses such as gym memberships, massages, traveling, etc.. Make a list of the things you need not "want."<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, don't give up, and keep up the faith. We're all in the same boat. But, there is hope in the way. Love will find a way.
4UBxVIYFaa	It won't be worth it.  The rule of which you speak is generally used by various MLS's in defining bedrooms.  Taxing municipalities are not required to observe that rule.<br>  <br>  As well, I don't think your tax assessment value would change appreciably over this issue.  Much more important would be an error in total square feet assessed and taxed.
K45ZTwryaa	I don't know if there is actually a real Zain Johnson & Associates somewhere in the world but that name is  associated with what is known as the Nigerian or 419 Scam.  It is an advance fee fraud scam promising a large sum of money if a person sends a smaller amount of money to them first.<br>  <br>  It usually comes as an email that says something like this:<br>  <br>  "Dear x x x x,<br>  <br>  My name is Mr Johnson Gilbert Muthusamy, a legal practitioner with ZAIN JOHNSON & ASSOCIATES in Puchong, Malaysia.<br>  <br>  I saw your contact and profile and decided that you could cooperate with me in this proposition.<br>  <br>  I have a client by Name Mr. Francis x x x x, who was deceased in November, 2007, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I am contacting you because you have the same surname as my deceased client and i felt that you could help me in the distribution of funding that were left in my deceased client's bank account. This funding is closed to be declared un-serviceable by the bank as there were no indicated next of kin or next of beneficiary of the funding in the bank account.<br>  <br>  The total amount of cash in the bank account of my deceased client is US$ 12.5 Million ( Say, Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only ),The bank had issued to me a notification to contact the next of kin of my deceased client for either to re-activate the bank account or to make claim of beneficiary, of the funding in the bank account, with a month surcharge of 6% to be deducted as an Escrow safe keeping fee of the bank account....."<br>  <br>  Bottom line is it's a scam.

AA10464818	The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. <br>  <br>  Legitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group.

They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month. <br>  <br>  Other companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).<br>  <br>  Pinecone Research <a href="http://www.pineconeresearch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pineconeresearch.com</a><br>  GreenField Online <a href="http://www.greenfieldonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenfieldonline.com</a> <br>  Harris Poll Online <a href="http://www.harrispollonline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.harrispollonline.com</a>  <br>  BuzzBack <a href="http://www.buzzback.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzback.com</a>  <br>  SurveySite <a href="http://www.surveysite.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveysite.com</a> <br>  SurveySavvy <a href="http://www.surveysavvy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveysavvy.com</a><br>  Survey Spot <a href="http://www.surveyspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveyspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/</a>|`|DorePwVOaa	Yes, but when I've done actual surveys from legitimate companies, I've only made about $20 per month, at most.

GHraE6Teaa	First, keep in mind that the current recession should not be major factor in charting your post graduate education and career path if you should choose to go that route.  You still have over a year of high school to complete and then 4 years of undergraduate studies at a university and the economic environment and employment market opportunities could be radically different in half a decade compared to what they are now.<br>  <br>  At this point in time your career path should be influenced most by what you find interesting and stimulating because one thing holds true and will probably remain steadfast by the time you graduate from college, and that is that post graduate professional jobs generally entail working lots of extra hours beyond the now almost obsolete 40 hour work week.  Doing what you find appealing is going to go a long long way towards your satisfaction with your career with those kind of long hours.  Going for dollars rather than job satisfaction is one of the reasons why many lawyers are unhappy in their career choice, and almost any career path has a huge range for salaries based on experience and particular area of employment for which a post graduate degree would be a qualification.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on getting excellent grades so you can get admitted into a top university and continue to excel in your undergraduate studies.  For many graduate degrees, your major in college is not nearly as relevant as your grades (with the notable exception of graduate degrees in the sciences and even for science based graduate degrees many universities now offer programs that tack on an additional 1 to 2 years to the curriculum for students who lack the sufficient science undergrad courses so they can take them as part of the graduate curriculum if their college grades were high enough) so draw upon your experiences in your first and even second years in college to discover what interests you.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't feel obligated to go straight from college to a graduate program.  For many careers, it can be worthwhile for you to actually go into the general career field area for which a graduate degree is geared to get exposure to it and see if it is really for you.  Law is a perfect example where you can try your hand as a paralegal first, get some real exposure to the field, and decide if it is something that you really want to commit to for the rest of your life before investing hundreds of thousands of dollars on a law degree.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	You are correct. There are more lawyers than there is an economic need for, and this will probably persist for at least the next 30 years.The only exception to this are Intellectual Property and patent lawyers, who have to have both a hard science degree AND a law degree. There aren't to many of them.<br>  <br>  I know a great many lawyers. Almost all are unhappy in their careers. Lawyers have an extremely high rate of alcoholism. .<br>  <br>  I would suggest you find something you enjoy studying, and find a way to get paid for doing that.  <br>  <br>  What you take in High School is pretty much irrelevant to your future career anyway.  <br>  <br>  Psychology is even more awash in useless graduates than law.|`|qhENBYAHaa	Do not go to law school unless you really, really, really want to be an attorney.  Law school is expensive and there is zero guarantee that a person who graduates law school and passes the Bar Exam will get a job.  <br>  <br>  Recently there was a survey on jobs for new lawyers and the average starting salary was around $40,000.  That is not much considering a new lawyer has around $100,000 in education debt.  The only attorneys getting high paying jobs are those who graduate top of the class from a big name school like Harvard or those whose daddy passes on the family law firm.<br>  <br>  The medical field seems to be the only area that is not being hit with recession.  As more and more boomers are aging they will need more medical attention.  <br>  <br>  You may want to speak with your school counselor about taking those tests which show what field you have an aptitude for.  That may help you.  Try to not look for the "high paying job" but for one that you will love.  If you can work at something you love, then the money will come.|`|WYjbuu6saa	No!!

I dont have nightmares about credit card companies.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	pay as much as you can on the cards - if the average int rate is 18%, then that's the kind of return on your investment you will get, compared to 0.2% in a savings account - start with the card with teh highest int rate and put as much extra each month on that card - pay the minimum on the others. when you pay off one card, take the total you were paying each month on that one and add it to the next card - do NOT close out the acct on the first card - just lock it away - closing it out will actually hurt your credit score|`|2N6oTOLQaa	A good rule of thumb when deciding what actions to take on finances is to look at the equation as though you were taking actions in reverse, and see if it makes sense. <br>  <br>  For example, in your situation you have 2 goals, saving money and paying off credit cards. Your question is how to prioritize between the two goals. So with each extra dollar you can get, if you pay it toward the credit cards, then its equivalent to taking a dollar out of savings to pay a credit card bill. If you put it in savings, then its equivalent to borrowing a dollar on a credit card to put it in savings. <br>  <br>  So then ask yourself, if you had no credit card debt and wanted to build up your savings, would you borrow on the credit card to put the money in a savings account? Probably not. Therefore it doesn't make any sense to put money into a savings account when you could use the same money toward your credit card bills. Therefore, in your situation, you should pay the credit cards off first, then build your savings.|`|T3DLgs6Vaa	Yes, take care of your credit card debt first because it sounds like the interest is really high.  If your credit score is decent, you can try to apply for another card and transfer the balance.  Good luck with everything.  It looks like you are on the right track though.|`|77319f446fd097199247c2f8e893568aaa	Focus on getting the credit cards paid off 1st. Make bigger payments on the one with the highest APR %. Once your debt is paid then start saving. Good Luck!|`|72hMibsVaa	first thing to do is put your credit cards away or have someone hide them on you. <br>  <br>  then make your payments till the balance starts dropping from 350 a month.  once you get it down, continue paying 350 a month till it is paid off.  <br>  <br>  Keep the credit cards then for emergency use only.  I have two cards I am paying off, and the cards have been put out of arms reach Not in my purse, so i do not use them.  gives me a total of 550$ for emergency use if I need it.   Once they are paid off, my payments will be 20 on one of them and 14 on the other one just to may the monthly fees.  I can handle that.  <br>  <br>  Once they are paid off, put the amount you would pay on them in a savings account.  One not linked to your debit card so you can not transfer money from it.   You can even have it set up through your bank to have that amount transfered monthly on it's own and you don't even have to worry about doing it.|`|9f363935da83a04ad649588218c4b33caa	You should focus on paying off your credit card debt first. You'll end up with more money in the long run because the interest you'll pay on the credit cards is far higher than any interest you'd earn with your savings account. Focus on paying off the highest interest cards first. Pay the minimums on all but the card with the highest interest rate. Send that card as much extra as you can afford until it's paid off. Once you pay off that card, move the extra payment to the card with the next highest interest rate. Continue to do this until your cards are all paid off. Once your cards are paid off, start putting money into your savings account.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	Depends.<br>  <br>  If the interest you are paying on your credit card is higher than your savings rate, you should just pay down the card.<br>  <br>  If you dont have any liquid cash, it is always a good idea to have some on hand. So I would save some.<br>  <br>  Focus on the cards though. Smarter long term strategy to pay those babies down.|`|Ilstga1kaa	I suggest that you pay a little at a time. If you have multiple credit cards, pay off the ones you really don't need, and then cancel them.|`|AA12144638	yes pay the lowest ones off first then when put a payment down put more then they ask for  it pays it off faster good luck

RhEhzGbraa	If the plumber caused this damage it is his or her responsibility to pay for the damages.  The plumber can file a notice of claim with his or her insurance company and he should then provide you with the name of the insurance carrier, policy number, claim number, name and phone number of the adjustor.  You should then call the adjustor and make sure that they follow up with you by sending an inspector out to see the damages and hopefully paying in full for your claim.  As long as they accept liability on behalf of their client and pay you for the damages, I would not file a claim with your insurance company.<br>  <br>  As another poster stated -- yes it is sometimes easier to file a claim with your own carrier.  However, there are several reasons not to do this.  First of all your deductible will be applied to any claim payment made by your insurance company, i.e. if your damages are $2,500 and you have a deductible of $1,000 you will only receive a check for $1,500.  You will get the deductible back if and when your company obtains payment from the plumber's insurance company (a process called subrogation) but that can sometimes take anywhere from 3 months to 1 year.  <br>  <br>  In addition, any claim you submit to your own insurance company will be recorded in a  database that all property insurance companies participate in called CLUE (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange)--you can find out more information or obtain your own record at this website: <a href="http://www.choicetrust.com/servlet/com.kx.cs.servlets.CsServlet?channel=welcome&subchannel=clue_info." rel="nofollow">http://www.choicetrust.com/servlet/com.k...</a>  Once recorded the claim information can never be erased and can result in questions being raised when you sell the property (the prospective purchaser's insurance carrier will be able to see the information and will inquire to make sure all repairs were done, etc. and some sales have been derailed by a negative CLUE report) and/or if you ever wanted to obtain insurance through another company.  Even though the claim will eventually be listed as having been closed with a recovery (from the subrogation) if you have repeated claims it can negatively impact you in renewing your insurance, in obtaining a policy through a different carrier or selling your property.<br>  <br>  In essence my advise is to go through the plumber's insurance carrier, he or she caused the damage they should be responsible for repairing it.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	If both the plumber and the builder (general contractor?) all have Commercial General Liability policies then they will cover the damage. However the easiest way to handle it is to file the claim with your insurer and have them go after the plumber/contractor.

Either way there's nothing you can do now.

I'm not sure that was unprofessional but it was a poorly worded ad. I have seen ads that say such and such a date "or until filled" which would allow the search to be lengthened or shortened as needed. The other thing that could have been going on with that job is that they were required by law, contract or policy to conduct a search for outside candidates even though they already had an internal candidate or someone else they wanted to hire. They place the ad to satisfy the requirement for a search while having no intention of hiring anyone who applied.

5ci9IZd2aa	Filing Bankruptcy is scary no doubt, but you will feel the weight lift off your shoulders when it's done. I did. First, File Chapter 7.   Chapter 7 will start you out with a clean slate, and after 2 years people will start looking at you again, but chapter 13 is worse because you still have debt your paying down. We are 5 yrs into ours we have still been able to buy cars, we bought a car back in August with a finance rate of 7.99% which isn't bad on a used car after bankruptcy. Oh by the way it stays on your credit for 7 yrs not 10 yrs. We  filed before the bankruptcy laws changed, so I don't know what it all entails know, but go see a lawyer you will feel better, not at first, because you feel shameful. I reminded myself that I am a responsible person, who fell into hard times and we had to pick ourselves up again. Oh one other thing if you want to keep your car while going through a bankruptcy you can. We were able to keep our car. The loan company was notified about the Bankruptcy, but as long as we were able to keep up the payments the court let us keep our car.|`|GkSCipsHaa	It would be illegal for his employer to discriminate against him for filing bankruptcy.

If you don't have too much equity in it (the amounts vary by state) you can keep the car (and the loan).<br>  <br>  It wouldn't effect your rent. You keep paying that or you can be evicted.<br>  <br>  Also, in order to file for a chapter 7 bankruptcy (where you have to pay nothing back) you need to be within certain income limits, which again vary by state.

You could also Babysit or house sit for people in your neighbor hood. If you are any way artistic ( paintings, drawings, sewing, knitting, etc...) You can try selling your stuff. That is another Idea get out all that stuff you no longer use and have a yard sale. There are other ways that could be a bit more uncomfortable, such as donating blood, plasma, and even donating sperm. That is if you are male and willing to do that.|`|5bcJh8WTaa	Glomifis international hire people who can work at home worldwide with 100% flexibility part time or full time <br>  <a href="http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/</a><br>  Check Jobs<br>  <a href="http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/jobs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/jo...</a><br>  Plus free biz plan<br>  <a href="http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/bizplan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://internet-money-ebooks.webs.com/bi...</a>|`|4TA85k1naa	Plenty of money making opportunity online and the one i find the most profitable is this one which i highly recommend. www.czone.info/moneyzone|`|JrKDKkR2aa	legal or not legal?
AA10259042	Some companies do not pay dividends because they have a very high return on equity and can provide a better return for their investors by reinvesting the money they would have paid in dividends.  Other companies are just plain poorly managed.|`|AA11173563	they may be using what they could have paid for capital improvements or saving it as retained earnings in case the economy gets worse or what ever the reason may be|`|t1zlbOURaa	Most dividend paying companies are established companies that are creating their product or service and generating income without having a focus on growth.<br>  <br>  So most are companies like utilities, food companies, household commodity companies, etc.<br>  <br>  Any company CAN pay a dividend as long as it's generating more income than it consumes.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Companies can buy back shares or pay dividends to distribute money to investors.

When they buy back stock the investors may benefit from a better tax deal via capital gains.|`|F3UxxmrLaa	It means just what it says.  They pay no dividends.  <br>  <br>  This in itself can be good or bad.  It depends on the circumstances.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps they are reinvesting profits for the growth of the company which would benefit you in the long run as it should increase your net worth in that company.<br>  <br>  Or, it could mean that they are losing money and have none to pay.|`|XZG35fxSaa	It doesn't mean anything in particular, except that they're trying to save money.<br>  <br>  But, a company that has a long history or paying increasing dividends, and is still paying, is usually a better investment.|`|AA10007793	A company that doesnt pay a dividend, and never has, is usually in their growth phase where they have opportunities to reinvest earnings at a rate higher than their cost of capital; the investment rate that increases the value of the company.  If they have no opportunities to do that the company, and the market they serve, has reached a level of maturity and they pay the excess out in dividends in the belief that shareholders can reinvest them at a higher rate than the company.  If a company has had a history of paying dividends and then decreases it or eliminates it that can be a sign of distress for the company.  This is happening a lot right now.|`|LK3PJVD3aa	It can mean a few things:<br>  <br>  The company is retaining it's earnings for reinvestment in the company to ensure growth. This is common with new companies.<br>  <br>  The company could be keeping an excess cash reserve to preserve liquidity in this market.<br>  <br>  The company could be operating at a loss and not have money to pay a dividend with.<br>  <br>  Companies are not required to pay dividends, therefore they may opt not to during difficult times.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	It means that they paid no dividend!  You kind of answered your own question.  What is means for investors depends on the stock's history of paying a dividend.  A company like Apple and Google never has and never will pay one anytime soon.  However, if a company has a history of paying a dividend and no longer is going to pay one out, then that is a VERY bad sign and a stock that you want to stay away from!|`|L9Cx70gtaa	It's like losing a fringe benefit.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	How about a hair salon?<br>  Like sweeping the floors and cleaning stuff?|`|a7ynfmhoaa	As someone already said - get your working papers from your school and you can apply at any restaurant as a dishwasher or bus person, fast food, walmart, kmart, home depot, supermarkets, drug stores - anywhere.<br>  <br>  Other types of jobs that would be "off the books" - cleaning houses, babysitting, yard work (I always hire a couple of teens to help clean up my yard in the Spring).<br>  <br>  I live near Lancaster - Darien Lake will also be hiring soon.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a definitive tutorial on how to set up your SEO metatags as well as proper design of your webpages.<br>  <br>  The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12016308	blog and forum commenting with your signature file set up with good keywords pointing back to your site<br>  <br>  article marketing<br>  press releases<br>  set up multiple blogs<br>  keyword research for all marketing efforts including your website - type in google keywords and you will get the url<br>  <br>  pay per click marketing<br>  set up social network sites - social bookmark everything<br>  search for google analytics tool<br>  do research on internal back links<br>  promote in blogs and forums that are in your niche<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <a href="http://sendmeatext.net" rel="nofollow">http://sendmeatext.net</a><br>  seo work <a href="http://seogroup.com" rel="nofollow">http://seogroup.com</a>|`|ofb6B2UAaa	Hey you should check out SEO websites they usually offer free tools for anyone to use.

Assess and agree training needs <br>  * Conduct some sort of training needs analysis this commonly happens in the appraisal process.  <br>  * Involve the people in identifying and agreeing relevant aligned training. * Consider organizational values and aspects of integrity and ethics.<br>  * Look also at your recruitment processes - there is no point training people if they are not the right people to begin with.<br>  * Exit interviews with leavers helps identify development needs.<br>  <br>  2. Create training or development specification <br>  * Having identified what you want to train and develop in people, you must break down the training or learning requirement into manageable elements. <br>  * Attach standards or measures or parameters to each element. <br>  * The 360 degree process and template and the simple training planner are useful tools.<br>  <br>  3. Consider learning styles and personality <br>  * People's learning styles greatly affect what type of training they will find easiest and most effective. Look also at personality types. Remember you are dealing with people, not objects. People have feelings as well as skills and knowledge. <br>  <br>  4. Plan training and evaluation<br>  * Consider evaluation training effectiveness, which includes before-and-after measurements.<br>  <br>  5. Design materials, methods and deliver training<br>  * Consider modern innovative methods.<br>  * Presentation is an important aspect to delivery.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)
a6864b98763d4f13080c1e56782e7578aa	Hello,<br>  1. Performance Reviews (or development reviews) - having a meeting face to face with an employee to set targets and goals for the year ahead.  This provides an ideal opportunity to discuss strengths and weeknesses, training and career aspirations.<br>  Problems with this; your performance review is only as good as the appraiser, if you line manager isnt very good at this, or you do not have a strong relationship, this would prevent the meeting from being productive.<br>  2. 360* feedback - this provides an employee with an opportunity to confidentially rate another individual on a variety of topics.  Usually a set of open and closed questions to allow feedback to be given to the appraised outlining strengths and weeknesses and areas for improvement.<br>  Problems - people may not give accurate information or may not complete the questionnaire.  Appraised may not take the criticisms on board and look to improve.<br>  <br>  3. Another popular and effective method of performance appraisal is employee ranking. Under this method the employees are ranked from best to worst on some characteristics. The rater first finds the employee with the highest performance and the employee with the lowest performance in that particular job category and rates the former as the best and the latter as poorest. Then the rater selects the next highest and next lowest and so on until he rates all the employees in that group.<br>  Problem - staff may feel victimised or demoralised by a fellow colleague who is perhaps on a greater rank for the same work.<br>  4. Probationary reviews - this occurs when someone commences a new role within a firm and provides both parites (employer and employee) with an opportunity to see if the person is right for the job and if the job is right for the person.<br>  Problems, should the hired person not work out the probation would be concluded and the post would need to be recruited for again.  Also the new start (or person on probation) may not provide you with an accurate true reflection of their working practice as they are just trying to get off probation.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)

AA10464818	No. The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	no such thing - no grants for any personal reasons
e2gPbnNyaa	There his no high score on a personality test, it is as the name implies a test of personality. However, different employers look for personalities that suit a particular position. If for instance you know the employer likes outgoing work motivated people, you simply have to examine the personality test you will be taking and answer accordiningly. I strongly caution you not to do this, if your personality does not fit the job description, you probably won't like the job. Furthermore, employers can tell in a short period of time whether your personality matches what the company is looking for.

The country is bankrupt.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	US treasury bills as risk free, just are not, although for very short terms we are fairly close.<br>  <br>  For longer terms, US treasury bills are a very high risk investment, because the yield is so low now that it has almost nowhere to go but up.  If it goes up, the value of a long term note drops. The risk is probably higher with US treasury bonds than for the stock market right now and ever so much more as the term increases.|`|AA10007793	For a stock use the yield on the10-year treasury strip, zero coupng bond.

But do your best to get your total balance down, particularly if the extra amount on your higher balance card will come close to your limit.  <br>  <br>  Main thing in all credit card management is to get your balances to zero as soon as possible. Credit cards are an expensive way to borrow money, even at 10%|`|XZG35fxSaa	Yes, there's no downside to transferring a balance to another card, if the new card has a lower APR, doesn't charge a transfer fee, and if you transfer the entire balance.|`|AA11315360	NO. Only transfer balances from the HIGH APR to the low APR.

It is better NOT to use it than close it. Right now is not the time to close any card because it reduces the amount you can borrow (effects your credit rating).|`|LK3PJVD3aa	You can  call your other card and ask if they will give you a promotional rate if you transfer the balance over.

A young girl in my town went to asia on a trip by herself and she went missing, her family has not heard from her in months and now the police are trying to find her.  Sorry I can't offer much help but I've been doing research and trying to get info from others who have taught in asia, but haven't found much luck in that.
EjX9p9dBaa	Well based on your stuff your tax bracket would be as follows:<br>  <br>  15% of the income between $8,025 and $32,550 plus 802.50.<br>  <br>  So for a taxable income of $22,000 your Federal taxes would be calculated as follows:<br>  <br>  $22,000 - $5,450 (standard deduction) - $3,500 (personal exemption)  = $13,050 taxable income.<br>  $13,050 - $8,025 = $5,025 (taxable at 15%)<br>  $5,025 * .15 = $753.75<br>  <br>  Federal Taxes = $753.75 + 802.50<br>  Taxes = $1,556.25.  <br>  <br>  So in another words you owe the feds $1,556.25 in taxes yet only paid $1,100.<br>  <br>  So yes you owe the feds roughly another $500 like you mentioned.  If you are married and file separately I would strongly suggest that you claim single on your W-4.  When married and filing separately you are pretty much paying the taxes of a unmarried person.<br>  <br>  Contact the IRS and ask to set up a payment plan.  Most of the time they are willing to work with you.<br>  <br>  The crappy thing is SS and medicare do not lower your taxable income, just your take home pay.

YADmlPZqaa	The great thing about Columbia is that it has something for people of all ages, at every stage in life. Charleston and Charlotte are only one and a half hours away and Myrtle Beach and Atlanta are about three hours away.<br>  <br>  If you are single, in your twenties, and like to party, Columbia offers a good nightlife. The University of South Carolina is in downtown Columbia making it a nice college city. It is relatively safe. I recommend The Vista or Five Points. <br>  <br>  If you have a family, I would recommend one of the cities on the outskirts of Columbia (ex: Irmo, West Columbia, Lexington). The schools are better, there is less traffic, the cost of living is low, and most are less than 15 min from downtown Columbia. I like Irmo, you can find a simple house in a nice neighborhood for around $120,000. A bigger house in a less moderate neighborhood for $170,000. There are also some really expensive neighborhoods, depending on your budget. The mall is in Irmo, along with a lot of restaurants. <br>  <br>  As far as health care jobs go, you will have a lot to choose from. The major hospitals that come to my head are Lexington Medical Center and Palmetto Health. Both of these hospitals have a huge main location and then many small doctor offices and a few emergency centers or outpatient centers. There are also many small practices.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Columbia is a very nice small city, with a diverse collection of things to do.

I agree paying add'l interest is bad but since the balances are fairly low, the add'l interest shouldn't be that much.
uD20jPAmaa	Promotional strategies are usually part of the marketing mix for a product or a line of products.  A promotional strategy can include personal selling, advertising, public relations, direct mail, packaging, etc. and there is usually a theme that runs through a number of those elements.<br>  <br>  An example of a promotional strategy targeted to consumers is gatorade's sports drinks:  they use celebraties to endorse/use the product; they put together an ad campaign and run it through a number of media (radio, television, internet, newspapers and magazines, etc.); they mail coupons directly to the home (or indirectly as a mass mailer); they package the product with promotional literature; they attend neighbourhood sporting events to do personal selling through personal testing (e.g. they attend swim meets and give out free samples).

Most states have their bankruptcy exemptions online. In some states, you can choose to take federal exemptions or state exemptions. The exemptions specify what you may keep and what you must surrender.<br>  For instance, I just filed in NY. In NY, you're allowed to keep $5000 worth of exemptions. But, your only allowed to keep $50 worth of books, $500 in jewelry and $450 in pets, just as an example. Most states are a lot lower then that. For instance, in Florida it looks like there is an unlimited homestead exemption, but, only $1000 exemption for personal items. Anything over that amount would have to be handed over to the trustee and liquidated.|`|HhaadKixaa	When you file your Bankruptcy Your Attorney will have you list all your debt you want to file.

Make sure your filing for Chapter 7 and not Chapter 13 or your end up making payments toward your old debt, defeating the purpose of the bankruptcy all together. There are guidelines on your income to qualify for chapter 7 now. so review the chart with your attorney.

f4e45d218389741a588b9c61e0ad123aaa	I think that there is no "standard" answer to this question, or a one-size-fits-all approach. <br>  <br>  Getting accurate estimations for such a survey the very first time would be time-consuming due to the research required. I would use a local online Journey Planner or Google Maps to calculate the time it would take me to reach one of the targetted interviewees, put the time in an Excel spreadsheet under a heading like "Trip Time" in hours, for instance, then keep doing the same for as many interviewees as it looks like the differences are worth it. I would also register at least the postcode & area of each interviewee in the same row. Depending on the differences between the times, I could settle for the data above from just 20 interviewees in order to get an average and use it with the rest; or I may need data from 50, or even 100. This can be an educated guess and can be personal, but naturally, the fewer the interviewees from which you derive an average, the less accurate the average will be. While getting those Trip Times, I would also include in another column the "Trip Cost" for each interviewee by either getting the public transportation price for each trip or the mileage and associated petrol consumption of my car.<br>  <br>  Then, I would add a column for the "Interview Time" in hours, and either put the same time there for everyone, or different times for groups of interviewees or even individual interviewees depending on the specifics of the survey.<br>  <br>  Depending on my personal circumstances, I can add a column titled "Interviewer Rate per Hour" or "Surveyor Rate per Hour". Even if the Interviewer is not costing the company anything--perhaps because it is my own business and I am the Interviewer, I can still put a rate per hour for myself, and I can estimate that rate on the basis of the value of my risk. Meaning, I would ask myself the question: if I were not the Interviewer in this job, and I was doing a different job, what is the absolute minimum rate per hour for which I would work? How much would I be earning per hour if I were working for someone else? And I would put that rate there, because that is practically how much this survey is costing me, keeping me busy from doing some other work.<br>  <br>  Finally, I would add a column titled "Total Cost" where I would calculate the total of ( Trip Cost + ( (Trip Time + Interview  Time) * Interviewer Rate per Hour) ). That would be the total cost of each interviewee. And by having many totals in that column, I can come up with a fairly accurate average cost per interviewee, and also a total cost for the whole survey.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers the question.|`|276374f4efacc187b84c283193edd914aa	ou contact a professional Survey company.

I have no affiliation with any of the sites below, I just found them on Google|`|AA10725304	What I've found is that these lists are very hard to obtain for free.  Just as you, I've found that you have to give your credit card information for free trials, etc. for a lot of websites out there.  <br>  <br>  Real estate agents have access to these lists but they are not going to just hand them over to you because then you wouldn't need them thus they wouldn't get their commission for selling the house to you.<br>  <br>  You can try banks but you will need to know the specific questions with the correct wording in order to get that list.  You aren't going to be able to just go in and say I'd like to withdraw $500 and may I have a foreclosure listing on the side?  It isn't Mickey D's.  And then there are gurus who will sell that information to you, exactly who in the bank to call, what to say, etc.<br>  <br>  Since you asked for free listings the best thing I can suggest is to peruse your local paper or online community, sometimes people places ads for help before they foreclose.  Or you can place an ad (you can do this free online) that says something like 'before you foreclose, contact me or I may be able to prevent your house from foreclosing".  Then real live people will contact you and you can try to negotiate however, I advise that you consult your lawyer and there will probably be time contraints dependent upon foreclosure date and I'm assuming you will have to get the bank loan, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search, if you find a totally free list, let me know!|`|faa918401e0808cb988d098390786dbaaa	Find a Realtor who is savvy in real estate investments.

izLEVnKIaa	Your teacher seems to have little grasp of both Employment Law and American Politics.<br>  <br>  In a perfect world the auto companies should have been left to go bankrupt as they are not profitable in their current form. However Chapter 11 is just protection for debt restructuring, as the autos had too much debt and wouldn't be able to refinance what they already have even with protection then it wouldn't work.<br>  <br>  The Reality is that these workers are massively over paid but are protected by strong Unions. They cannot fire their workers as they still have 100,000's of pensions to pay and severance written into their contracts. To half their work force would cost GM in the region of $40bn unless it can get government help.<br>  <br>  Which comes to the second point, while the romantics out there believe that Obama was elected on a change platform; he was in fact tied with McCain until the recession. He was voted into power because he promised to save peoples jobs and save the economy. The connected jobs for the auto industry are over 2 million, if he lets the autos go bankrupt then he will have to break his promise  to more than 2 million of people that voted for him in his first 100 days in office.

However, the request itself negatively impacts your score, so don't get it requested too often.
6fd8d7ab125f5dbca19f623ed74f9956aa	Im sorry that your sister are like that because my philosophy is if you dont have family you dont have ****.If your sister have made it clear to you that they dont have time or energy to spend with you than why are you waiting to get that great job at home.You have to do what is right for you and what makes you happy.It sounds to me that where u are doesnt make you happy.There are churchs in your home town where u can meet people.Do you really want to be around people or family who dont care and bring you down by saying they dont have time for you?It sounds pretty sad and ruthless to me.You need to follow your hears if you think sooner or later they will want to be closer to you then stay but its a two way street you cant put all the effert into it and get nothing back.I hope you can resolve this with your family but if not go and be happy.|`|AA12284883	I think you should do what makes you happy.

But when you're alone and have money you'll wish you'd put your family first.  Especially if you have kids someday and you have no family near you...that's hard.<br>  <br>  At least give it a chance to work there.  Your intentions dont sound well though because you obviously had other ideas because you applied out of your area.  Are you sure you didnt already make up your mind and you feel bad and want someone on here to tell you that was right?  <br>  <br>  where are your intentions?|`|AA12228880	It sounds like you have already made up your mind.  <br>  <br>  Go back home, but stay in touch with your sisters.

4f3GfrN6aa	I work two jobs.  My full time job is in a factory, but my casual weekend and after hours job is in a department store.  <br>  <br>  I find that the best jobs for second jobs tend to be stuff with flexible hours that fit around your current job.  Try cleaning.  While it's not glamorous, you'll most likely be cleaning office buildings, which are usually full of clean people who don't vomit every where or spread faeces up the wall (I used to clean nightclubs, believe me, that happens).  Most cleaning is in office buildings and stores, which are relatively clean anyway, so you just wipe down surfaces, dust, and vacuum and mop floors.  It's pretty easy.<br>  <br>  You could also try hospitality, although I didn't enjoy it at all.<br>  <br>  You could sell some stuff you don't need anymore in the local newspaper classifieds.  That would make some extra money and get rid of clutter around your home.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	First, I would take a look at my spending and see if there are wants that could be reduced to allow you to live within your means.  Then I would find a part time job that will allow you to get out of debt.  I have been successful living on a cash only basis for the past seven years since my bankruptcy.  Do I want more things then I can afford?  Yes, but I have learned my lesson about living outside of my means and saving to buy what I really need.|`|JXYMtYFDaa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. I give you my word that they pay.|`|egCSxjRiaa	Retail stores, supermarket cashier/stocker.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Start by looking around your house and getting rid of the good things you do not use.  Have a garage sale or sell things on craigslist.org (ebay is too expensive, and paypal too).  Whatever you do you will need to spend most of your free time and effort doing it.
2dd217fe0396e15617d22fb20a250d09aa	ask for proof of your wrong doings. most employers don't just take somebodys word if they are talking bad about someone.|`|AA11016556	Who's the trouble maker  here?<br>  When "that" many people are against you,.... it makes us wonder?<br>  ....is it THEM?<br>  .....or, is it YOU?<br>  .....so Why aren't you liked?<br>  ......when THAT many people want to quit because of one person .....I'd say you need to take a GOOD look at "YOURSELF"<br>  <br>  .....WHAT IF "YOU'RE" AN  A**HOLE?|`|577c65badc4c3c922a9ed289ba83e4a6aa	if people make trouble for you it's time for you to look for your next job.  Put your resume together, look your best and go apply for an evening or weekend job.  While you are doing those types of jobs look for a permanent day job.  If you need education then get it now while you are still on a job.  Ask your boss what education that you could get to make yourself more valuable at the job you are doing now.  Usually people who earn a low wage have a lot of bickering going on in the workplace so you might want to get more education so you can command a higher pay.  Maybe even a job where you can have your own business.|`|AA10275501	maybe they're not making you look bad...but you are....omg "lien" is something that is legally placing a hold on a piece of property .......I think you mean "lying" ...telling an untruth.|`|WkDIaINJaa	im going to report you for not using english.|`|tXJHElzHaa	dont listen to them, do your job and dont listen to what they have to say, they are stupid loser who dobt care about them selves.

dc08146ab26aa83c9e4e6f5bc0d56b9eaa	Try contacting a local real estate agent. They will know everything there is to know about affordable, safe options. A really good website to browse local real estate/real estate agents is: <a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/news/256_IDX,_Inc._Introduces.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.idxbroker.com/news/256_IDX,_I...</a> <br>  <br>  (just click on your state) <br>  <br>  It's really easy to navigate and is full of info about realtors with links to their personal websites, which will have all the available homes/rentals in the area along with community info, so you can do some research before you contact anyone. Hopefully that works for you. Good luck!
F3UxxmrLaa	To start you'll have to finish high school with good grades and then attend college where you'll also need good grades.  After graduation from college you can apply for law school.  If accepted, depending somewhat on your grades again, you'll go to law school for two more years.  Then, after graduation, you can take the Bar exam in your state.  Should you pass you're a lawyer.<br>  <br>  Again, at this stage it's all in your grades at school.  Do your best and try hard.  Good luck.|`|WYjbuu6saa	Yes, it will be VERY, VERY difficult.  The field of Law is very competitive, and unless you know someone  (mommy and/or daddy already a member of a law firm), you probably won't be able to find a job.  <br>  <br>  Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in!!  Many reasons.  Main reason?  We simply have WAY TOO MANY Lawyers - we have a GLUT of Attorneys!<br>  <br>  Which means.....even IF you finish law school, you probably won't be able to find a job when you are done - plus you'll owe approx $150,000+ in debts.<br>  <br>  The law schools won't tell you this - law students are easy money for them - the law schools have to make very little investment in a law student.  The law schools continue to churn out graduates even though they know the market/economy is SATURATED.  <br>  <br>  Suggestion:  Consider and look into the field of HEALTHCARE! << this is where the jobs are! and scholarships!<br>  <br>  Good luck.
Kq4usVUTaa	In short, it's where you learn the most!  I can't tell you about your program specifically, but I'll give you a run down of what our clinicals were like...<br>  1st semester they kind of ease you in... bed baths, vitals, assessment, emptying foleys, bed pans, getting patients up for therapy etc.  I think we did a few meds too.  We also started with the care plans and stuff.<br>  2nd semester was all of the above, plus more technically skills. I did my first IV, Foley, central cath dressing changes, sterile dressing changes, tracheostomy care, tube feeds, more meds.<br>  3rd semester I did an OB rotation, pediatric rotation and geriatric rotation.  It's more or less a continuation of these skills plus learning how to calculate pediatric drug dosages etc.  I also got to do some of the more complicated skills like wound packing<br>  last semester... yay... did a community rotation which involved lots of education!  Currently doing ICU/Critical Care... lots of meds, IV's, ventilators, yadda yadda<br>  They will ease you in.  Take all opportunities as you get them, even if they are scary1  The more you do something the less scared you will be!|`|M8504cJPaa	You do things like, vital signs, assessment, bed baths, help patients with breakfast, lunch, or dinner, give medications, change IV's, work with IV pumps, read new orders made by doctors, look at labs, empty commodes or foley caths, take patients off of bed pans, familiarize your self with ventilators, suction, do paper work, and help other nurses out when they need it. Its a great experience!|`|jSn8Vd1taa	I just started my clinicals and they're so much fun! We do health care plans, health promotion/teaching, vital signs, general assessments, head to toe exams, changing dressings, bathing clients, helping with morning routine and feeding, indwelling tubes care etc...it's a lot of fun :)

Therefore you only have one federal income tax return actually filed.

All they will do is charge you $100s of dollars per hour to tell you to register a trademark, which you can do yourself.<br>  <br>  What you need is a business development consultant.  An attorney will give you tools and documents and possibly help negotiate deals that are already on the table, but attorneys normally do not go out, pound the pavement, dream up of ideal partnerships and develop the relationship.<br>  <br>  You’ll save yourself a lot of money by finding these deals yourself and then engaging an attorney at the appropriate time to help you close it.|`|EHNUPYcaaa	Try www.legalzoom.com - can maybe save some money too!

Secondly you should check for other liens such as IRS that could make it difficult for you to foreclosure if the tax lien does not get paid. There are several search web sites online. My favorite is Lienfax.Com. You can instantly check any property for IRS income tax liens and other liens.

I1VivZxfaa	If you want the formula, you can download it from the FTSE website. It's a book/guideline in a thick book that wouldn't fit here.<br>  <br>  To boil it down to simple steps...FTSE (rules are largely objective based, unlike MSCI who have a lot of subjective rules) believe that the index should be objective with rules that are transparent.  Why? so Investment managers can predict changes to the index and manage the portfolio accordingly.<br>  <br>  The general approach is as follows (details, please download the spec sheet yourself...but the steps easier to discuss has been simplified as follows  :<br>  <br>  1. Id top 100 stocks in terms of market size<br>  2. Test for liquidity (ie. daily volumes) & free float (this won't be an issue for the F100, but they are checking the % number of shares available vs shares that are not tradable)<br>  3. The largest stock have the largest weighting and there is a meticulous formula on how to calculate the weight (ie. # of shares) for each share - once again, download the book and formula with all the rules.  The rules will change, if there is a merger, dividend, etc., etc.<br>  4.

1vtNEztMaa	Yes, it happen to me. I forgot to pay a traffic ticket (I know I was stupid) and it was found on a background check for a security licence. In my case, because it was only an unpaid fine I just paid it, got the warrent cleared off my record, and I got my license. <br>  <br>  It really depends on how intense the check is and what the warrant if for. A lot of companies just check for felonies. Others check everything. I would be be up front with them and get it paid off asap so it doesn't interfere with future opportunities.|`|Poht8MR9aa	I think they will appreciate you being honest and upfront, that being said it is a corporation and they may have set polices, where a private or family owned company may be more willing to work with you.<br>  <br>  I think the being honest is worth a shot.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	What was the warrant for?  I guess you should have thought of that before the action that produced the warrant.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	That's a tricky situation. The warrant will absolutely show up on a background check. Perhaps the best option here is to approach whoever is hiring you at Macy's and explain the situation and that they should expect to see the warrant before they do the check and just toss out your application.

qGfAlDd2aa	I would start looking around now.  You have to make sure the appraised value of your home is at least what you finance.  With the balance you owe, it's unlikely you will be able to pay it off before the economy takes off again at which time your interest rate will increase.  You could lock in a long term low rate if you act soon.  Shop around, don't panic, you have time now.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, start paying off the loan aggressively.  You can finance for 30 years and pay it off at the 15 year rate (or more).  That gives you an opportunity to make a smaller payment if money gets tight.|`|a0qiWMitaa	No you only have one year left on the arm and it should stay low in the next year, think about it. The way the housing market is now rates will be low for a while. I would only refi if I could reduce the rest of the mortgage by 1.5-2%. What is the market value of the home compared to what you owe? You might be better off to keep the loan you have and finish paying off your current mortgage. If the arm is making you nervous you should try to pay a little more on the principle to make it go faster, just say 25.00 to 50.00 more per month. When the arm is paid off, you are used to paying that additional bill every month so just pay a little more on your PRINCIPLE of the main mortgage.We pay 50.00 more per month on the principle of our 30 year so it will be paid off sooner and save us more in the long run, that's like paying a little more than 1 additional month of mortgage per year and over the period of 10 years it cuts down over 1 year of full mortgage payments.|`|LK3PJVD3aa	Yes, as long as your property appraises and the fees are reasonable.

NwkZ5OmCaa	You've got a lot more to do.<br>  <br>  You need to explain where YOU were living and where the children were living.<br>  <br>  If the children were living with you and *not* with your sister, you have to explain how YOU were a dependent and therefore could not claim the children as your own qualifying children.  This means you had to have less than $3500 of income and that you didn't support yourself.  If you didn't support yourself, what did you live on?  Savings?  Food stamps?<br>  <br>  Once you can't support yoruself, then your sister is potentially eligile to claim them as qualifying relatives (not as qualifying children if she didn't live with them) to get the $3500 exemption only.  No EIC.  However, she has to show how she provided more than half of each child's support including housing, food, etc.  If you got housing assistance, food stamps, welfare, etc, she has to have outspent that.<br>  <br>  Get IRS publication 501, page 20 and fill it out.  If there is a remote chance your sister is eligible, use the page to do your letter and attach the prove that she spent the money. Your word is simply not good enough.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Just that way and then attach PROOF or they will ask for proof.  They are getting stickier and stickier on these quirky ways people are obtaing all the child and EIC credits now.|`|AA12341578	I agree that you'll need to show proof, and you'll also need to provide more information. I would say, if you're not confident writing a letter, search for a sample letter online that you can work from. Or hire someone to write it for you. I know I write letters for $15 a page and you might could find it cheaper than that, but this is a VERY important issue so you don't want to gamble with it not being done well. Wish you the best!

If they know you are trying to sell the house, they will not go through the trouble of writing the loan.  If you do, however, find a bank to refinance like that, then read the fine print about early pay-off.  Some banks charge a large fee if you pay your loan off before say 24 months or some set period of time.  That could be an issue if you refinance and then immediately sell.<br>  <br>  If you decide to keep your house and refinance, they may require that you take it off the market before proceeding with the refinancing.<br>  <br>  Just talk to your lender.  If you go through a mortgage broker/company, check the Better Business Bureau for their rating.  I used a company I found via Lending Tree, and they really tried to screw me over for lack of a nicer description.

Most attorneys will give you a free consultation.<br>  <br>  Do not admit to the debt being yours.  Make them prove everything.  Deny that they are entitled to late charges, interest, attorneys fees, collection costs, everything.  If you don't challenge something the court will take it to be true.  Deny that the amount owed is correct, make them produce copies of your statements showing the charges.  Make them produce your original, signed account agreement.   Deny, deny, deny.  <br>  <br>  Is the original bank suing you or is this some collection agency that purchase the written off debt?  If it isn't the original bank there is a good chance they can't prove anything and are just hoping you don't show up in court.<br>  <br>  Do not agree to any delays.  It is common when a collector goes to court they are hoping for a default judgment and when you show up they ask for a delay.

Nevada and Delaware are popular states in which to incorporate. You may still need to register your corporation in Louisiana. If you can do your banking and other business with an out of state address, you may be able to avoid the taxes in Louisiana. Keep in mind that you will have to pay corporate taxes in the state of incorporation, such as franchise and excise taxes. You may want to investigate further before making your decision.

Note down your accomplishments in the current year and highlight the goals that have been met. Also note down the challenges that restricted you from meeting some goals.<br>  If you are a new employee and this is your first appraisal, review the job description given to you at the time of joining. If your job description involved achieving a certain sales target, make a note of those months when you exceeded or met the target.<br>  Track your accomplishments <br>  I find it difficult to recall all my accomplishments at the end of the year and find most fellow professionals struggling with the same issue. I recommend that you track your accomplishments on a regular basis. <br>  Create a file or folder and save all those appreciation mails, letters of recommendations or any other awards and certificates you may have received. <br>  You might think this could come across as pompous. However, if your boss leaves the organisation right before the appraisal period, you will have nothing tangible to demonstrate to your new boss.  <br>  Develop positive references<br>  If you have been nice to people you work with, you can safely use them as references to validate your professional strengths and accomplishments. Make sure senior members of the organisation are aware of your potential. <br>  While your boss is responsible for the performance discussion, the head of the department or some other senior member usually gives the final go-ahead before stamping a final rating on your performance. <br>  Often, it's not what you know, but who you know that matters. <br>  Make a wish-list<br>  Put together a list of things you want to ask your boss during the discussion. This could include a change in job responsibilities, financial rewards, change of location, tools and resources, etc. <br>  Most professionals regret not having stated their expectations clearly, thinking that it will go against them. Your wish-list is an opportunity for your boss to understand what will fuel you to give your best to the organisation. <br>  You often do get what you ask for. Take your chances. <br>  Identify improvement areas<br>  It's important to be realistic and acknowledge your opportunity areas. Ask a friend at work for candid feedback about how employees perceive you. This will save you from nasty surprises during the discussion. If people around you don't think very highly of you, rest assured your boss would already know the same. <br>  Speak to your human resource manager and ask them if they have a 360 degree feedback system that you can take. This will give you objective feedback from your boss, peers, clients and other stakeholders. Once you identify your weak areas, set an improvement goal with a timeframe and document the same for your boss' review.<br>  Proof read your appraisal document<br>  Once you have jotted down your key accomplishments, strengths, expectations, improvement areas and future goals (in that order), proof read your document at least twice. <br>  Remember, your boss will probably be looking at many such appraisal documents and lack of formatting and spelling errors will not give you any brownie points. Treat your appraisal document like a job application; invest time in making it look good.<br>  The annual review can also be a job interview for a promotion. So prepare for it throughout the year and show your boss you have the qualities that people in higher positions possess.|`|d3ae96e6022bb69d75722a8ac5583c93aa	I think you answered your own question....and you are looking for some sort of validation...you can do whatever you want to do, whatever makes you happy...if you have to go back to school to get to where you want...<br>  <br>  I would talk to people in the fields that interest you then find out what qualifications you need...people are usually receptive when you are interested in their careers.

cfacbaccda1ec71a0b72ef085a86d643aa	Advantages of Franchises:<br>  <br>  One of the major advantages of franchises is the established name recognition it provide to the business. If a small business is associated and linked with a big-business then there is a high probability that the small business would propel due to the firm backup and support of an established big business. Running a small business under the franchisor's name and organization is very beneficial for businesses that can’t afford much finance and capital investment for their own business.<br>  <br>  Another major advantage of franchises is that when a business is associated with a franchisor then the big-business themselves help in corporate marketing of the small industry or business they are providing support for. Having the interest of big-budget industries in a low-budget business is a very effective marketing tactic and these franchises policy ensures the proper marketing of a small business.<br>  <br>  An advantage of franchises is the bulk purchasing power it gives to small business and industries. Since most of the initial financial burden is provided to the business once it’s franchised by the franchiser therefore this enables the business to buy equipments, products and other necessities to run the business with ease and without worrying about the financial investment.<br>  <br>  A major advantage of franchise is the training and management facilities the franchisor provides to the business. A company which provide capital and investment to any small business have vested interest in the success of the small business. Therefore the companies that provide franchise ensure that the business in which the money is being invested is run and manage properly. The big-businesses and industry provides all the necessary training to the small business staff and provide additional resources and decision-making capabilities to a small business. <br>  <br>  Disadvantages of Franchises:<br>  <br>  Disadvantage of franchises includes the indulgence of a big-business into a small business. The creative control that a small business owner have is often hinder when franchising in done. Any decision which is to be made is to be consulted and approved by the franchisors. This limits the authoritative control of the small business owner to a great extent.<br>  <br>  Another disadvantage of franchises is reaching a general agreement on terms and conditions. There are several occasions when the term and conditions imposed by the investors and franchisors are biased and getting a firm deal with the companies safe-guarding the interest of both parties is a complex task.<br>  <br>  A disadvantage of franchises is that the much time is required while selecting a franchise. A complete and through research is required to select the right franchise and to determine whether it would work for the business or not.<br>  <br>  Another disadvantage of franchises is that this is a complex procedure and there are numerous instant during the business when heated discussion and disputes occurs between the small business and franchisor.|`|AA10275501	franchisee fees each month<br>  <br>  mandatory store changes every few years to upgrade the look|`|Psf2Ojioaa	Franchise's are fantastic.<br>  <br>  The biggest advantage is that you have a proven business system that you know works.

BnOOA0Q5aa	Transferring your balances to a 0% APR credit card is a great move! Yes, you might see a slightly negative impact on your credit score (in the short-term)-- but these issues will resolve with time. If you aren't taking out a mortgage or other BIG loan soon, you really shouldn't worry about it. There's a great list of balance transfer credit cards here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.asapcreditcard.com/0-apr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asapcreditcard.com/0-apr.html</a><br>  <br>  You're right, paying a 'balance transfer fee' is really small in comparison to the interest you would pay on your debt over time. The amount of money you save makes it worth paying the fee.<br>  <br>  Will it look suspicious? NO... savvy consumers transfer balances all the time! You're making the right move... just avoid creating more charges and getting yourself deeper into debt.|`|AA10275501	who cares if the fee is 10%...transfer it and your fico score will skyrocket.  keep track of the temporary interest reduction then when it is almost up transfer it again and your fico score will raise up again.|`|27df4c19235c66c92b00defcd9d586ebaa	People balance transfer (BT) amounts all of the time. No it won't look suspicious, thats what BT's are for.<br>  <br>  If you would not be paying a BT fee or paying a low BT fee, it probably would be a good idea to transfer it over to a 0% card. <br>  <br>  With having zero interest to pay on the total amount, you will  be able to pay the balance off at a faster pace, if you are dedicated in paying it off. <br>  <br>  Do the math first though, if you have to pay a BT fee make sure that you would not be paying more to BT than you would be in paying interest with your current account.|`|9c993c17a62c2469fcea0707f70e4be8aa	1. Stop charging<br>  2. Don't get another balance transfer- closing accts looks bad on your credit and the longer you have a card the better, instead of charging and transfering and getting a new card everytime intro rate is about to end (which is a cycle you will find hard to get out of) just make larger payments the 1 card you have now- once you start getting that paid down it will show your available credit is increasing. which will help your credit score.  <br>  3. It doesnt look suspicious- people do it all the time- its just putting you in a bigger hole everytime while the bank is making more and more money off you

If you want your debt to go down, you're going to have to pay additional money each month, so you can reduce the principal.|`|1Fg7Tybvaa	One of the problems is that the Prime rate varies so<br>  one month the prime rate may be 7% the next month it<br>  could be 18% (I am over exaggerating this but just<br>  to make a point) Lets do simple math assume a fixed<br>  rate at 12% and a balance of $10,000 your monthly<br>  interest would be ($10,000 *0.12)/12 or $100 per month<br>  if your minimum payment is 1.5% of the balance your would<br>  pay $150 so $150 payment - $100 interest $50 comes<br>  off of the balance.

The only drawback is that it'll take a VERY long time.  However, if you do get an offer from another credit card for 0% on balance transfers (and accept it), then all your monthly payments will be going to principal so the balance will go down faster.  But you have to make sure you pay off that balance on the 0% account before the introductory offer expires.|`|AA11858895	what the first guy said was mostly right. <br>  <br>  You wont NEVER pay if off, but it will take you a very long time like you have found out.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, 10k at 6.25% is going to charge you about 75 bucks a month in interest, so if you pay 150 that is only lowering your debt by 75 bucks a month. Not to mention you most likely had a balance transfer fee of 75 bucks.<br>  <br>  So basically you need to pay more on it a month, but you dont need me to tell you that, I am sure you know that one already, but there is a difference of what you SHOULD do and what you can afford to do.<br>  <br>  That does seem like a lot of interest though, you may want to make sure that you werent a day late with a payment or something and they raised your rate up on you.  <br>  <br>  What I would do if I were you is call Bank of America and say that you have an offer from another company to transfer this money away from them unless they can give you a better rate.  They have a "retention" criteria if you pass then they will make you a better offer.  If they say..."sorry we cant do anything" then you know you didnt pass retention and atleast it was worth the shot.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|c61325aa87935d634d6579671f1b48a9aa	Very possible. Interest is a killer. If you make minimum payments..well, most of it goes towards interest.<br>  <br>  But here is the thing...you need to review you statements and calculate your rates.

However, property taxes are high. ( about 3500 to 4000 ) Moved to Florida after kids were out of the house, the cost of housing is astronomical, however property taxes are almost nil.  Depending on the county wages are not that great. Volusia county, cheaper wages, Miami, Dade, Broward, higher wages.  Utility bills i.e. electric is fairly reasonable compared to NY, however,  water is expensive.<br>  Have a son in N.C. which was reasonable , but now seems to be booming. Demand is pushing the cost of housing up.<br>  Have  a friend in Arizona, property is sky rocketing, again demand.<br>  Have family in Nebraska, if you stay away from larger cities, housing, taxes reasonable, however, you have to drive hours to find a decent job.<br>  Have a friend in Vegas, makes good money, but his rent is a thousand a month for a 2 bedroom apartment.<br>  Have had friends who tried California, but failed, extremely expensive.<br>  So the answer is, unless you can move to an area that is not developed yet, you can get something reasonable, however, make sure logistically it is going to take off in the next 5 years.<br>  My uncle bought a piece of land in Florida 17 years ago for 9000 dollars, he put a 70,000 3 bedroom house on it.

VpjQpAOYaa	Alot of price negotiation comes down to the seller's motivation.  If the seller is motivated, they are more likely to accept the lower price.  <br>  <br>  Rule of thumb?  Know what similar properties are going for and offer accordingly.  If you are comfortable offering a lower price, go ahead.  But an unmotivated seller will either straight out reject the offer or counter.  But at least you have shown interest and if there is a counter, you have begun the negotiation.  How do you know if they are motivated?  Really, you don't - but if you have a good agent, they will try to find out for you before writing the offer. <br>  <br>  Beware of nibbling, when you are getting close to a deal and you feel compelled to ask for a bit more, one more concession, a little more off the price.  Too many deals get scrapped this way.  The seller gets disgusted and is willing to walk away.  If you have been negotiating, you really want the house and are close to making a deal, it may be in your best interest to accept the most recent offer.|`|YS3NnJtHaa	Just work with a good realtor as your buyers agent.

Has the seller has problems with criminal activity in the area<br>  *Nearby Schools performance rates may be a factor.<br>  *Problems with neighbors.<br>  In general though if sufficient information about the seller in unavailable its a matter of how many residences in the area are available. If the seller holds out on a set price it will take them alot longer to sell. Whereas if they sell up earlier for a lower price and put the money in another investment they are likely to get the same price over the same amount of time. ?f you look at the average sale time span and then work out the average interest rates over that period for the sale price you will probably get the amount of reduction that the seller is prepared to sell by|`|KLWAYX4xaa	you need to see the house inspection report to see what things have to be fixed,say it needs a new roof then you to pay a lower price or the seller needs to fix it.

They may be willing to negotiate a lower price if the terms are good.  By that I mean, how much down-payment will you have, will you make the offer contingent upon selling another home, etc.  Seller's don't like contingencies.  You really need to base your decision on the comparable properties and use those as your negotiating tools.  Your Realtor should have some idea of the seller's situation and how quickly they need to sell by talking to the other agent.  You should trust your Realtor to guide you through the process.  Most agents will tell their clients never to outright refuse any offer but to counter.  Then the haggling begins.
pI7jAcTDaa	The Federal Reserve and the bond market play a big part in how the economy works and how interest rates are determined.  Many numbers and indices go in to the caluculations and many things affect the rate like Economic indicators, Job stability, bond rates, treasury bills, the stock market, etc. just to name a few, it is a complex calculation.  Banks then sell their money based on what the buyers on Wall Street will purchase mortgage backed securities at.  <br>  <br>  I do not think there is any one place that can tell you all of this but you could try and look on the internet and the information that you ascertain will only be good for that moment in time as it is an ever flucuation calculation.  The bottom line is the rates are what they are on the day they are issued, the are in a constant state of flux with some times being more volatile than others.  The movement of the rates helps control the economy by speeding it up or slowing it down.  The mortgage industry is in a huge state of turmoil right now with all the information in the news, etc.  One thing you can always count on is that rates might go up and rates might go down.
