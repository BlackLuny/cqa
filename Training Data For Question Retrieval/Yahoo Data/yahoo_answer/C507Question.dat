20081120151939AAkzQK1	Health;Diet & Fitness	What does my loss of appetite mean?	Hello. I've been having really weird loss of appetite recently. Like, I never feel hungry anymore. It's not that stuff doesn't taste good. It's just that I don't feel like eating it. Anything. Even some of my favorite foods.       This has been going on for maybe three weeks. During these past three weeks, I've felt hungry maybe three or four times.       I'm not hungry at times I usually am, like when I wake up in the morning, or at lunchtime, or between lunch and dinner, or even at dinner. It's so strange. Every time I try to eat, I just feel like I'm full and I'm adding food onto fullness. Not exactly pleasant.      I'm not anorexic and I don't think I'm fat. According to my physician, I'm at a healthy weight.      I haven't been feeling particularly depressed or anything, but I have been feeling kinda restless lately. Does anyone know what this could mean?

I am ok during the day, but I make myself go to sleep earlier, (or stay on here) to keep my mind distracted....if I keep ignoring the stupid urge to do this act, this act that could cost me so much in my personal life if I were caught....I hate myself when I feel like this. I know it is stupid, but when I am alone, the sneaky part of my brain says; just give that person a call, and you will be hooked up.      This is something I don't want to have to struggle with again. I beat it once (after 6 months of use) for almost 10 years. Why did it pop back up again, and do you have any pointers to keep my mind focused where it needs to be, and protect myself from financal and legal troubles?

Everyone told me it was just baby fat, and when i stretched out it would go away. Well now im 19 and 5'2'' and my baby fat never went away. Although i was plus sized from 14yrs and up i maintained a regular pattern of weight. I am now realizing that ok im done being chunky and i want to be healthy, not skinny. But in order to curb my appetite im taking appetite depressants, i eat less than 1000 calories a day..sometimes only about 500. i drink atleast eleven ounces of water each day, and excerise doing yoga, stretches and abdominal massaging. Iv been doing this for almost three months and iv only lost about two inches and 14 pounds. is that good? i was at 204...*thats when i was like WHOAH* and now im 191.

Pretendo explicar isso na consulta, mas vou levar anotado num papel, pois preciso ser bastante objetivo nessa hora.         Obrigado.

Miren, sì uno quiere tener un cuerpo relativamente perfecto no es muy complicado, consiste en una buena alimentaciòn, y cuando digo alimentaciòn no me refiero a dietas, saber comer  que es diferente, carnes y verduras al mediodìa, y pastas a la noche, no necesitan prohibirse de nada, caminar 40 cuadras diarias, o correr a trote lento15minutos y caminar a paso rapido otros 10, minutos, eso lo podes ir incrementando y no tiene costo alguno, tengo 43 a?os y hace 15 que lo hago,cambio totalmente mì vida,era adicta a  cuanta dieta encontraba,todo esta en uno querer estar bien,no somos modelos de televisiòn para estar arriesgando el cuerpo y la salud, somos seres humanos se pude comer de todo pero en medida razonable, sòlo hay que quere y van a ver como aprenderan hacer muchisimas comidas y no engordaran, andar en bicicleta disfrutar del aire libre nada de eso sale plata y te ocupa 1hs diaria seguramente estas sentada en la pc.-Tù salud es màs importante que dietas y pastillas eso te aruina.

20090203084507AApsykK	Health;Mental Health	Could you please give me some advice about anxiety and depression?	I'd really appreciate some advice.   I've been suffering from anxiety since I was about 11 years old. I had a panic attack out of the blue one day at school and I've never been the same since. Because of my anxiety I've never been able to hold down a proper job or have a proper relationship. My anxiety usually takes the form of breathlessness, stomach pains and feeling nauseous. It's ruined my life.   I've also had depression since I was a teenager. Sometimes I don't see any future for myself and I'm scared I'll do something silly.   I always thought I'd grow out of this but I haven't and I've had to cope with being this way for a very long time now.   I've never told anybody about this but I've recently decided to go to my doctor only I find it very difficult to go along and explain all of this to him.I don't want counselling or therapy. I just want to take a pill that will make me feel 'normal', whatever that is.       Do you think he will prescribe something that will counteract the anxiety or depression or both? In other words could I be on more than one type of medication?   Also, is it common for people to be on medication for the rest of their lives? If it works for me then I don't see any problem with being on it indefinitely although I've heard that some doctors may have problems with this.      Thank you for answering.

20081016175541AAiqrzQ	Health;Mental Health	How can I stop from getting so over-emotional about everything?	Whenever someone criticizes me (especially teachers or adults), I get really overemotional and my face gets red, and my eyes start watering.      The thing about it is that I'M not upset, it's just a reaction that my body's doing without my brain agreeing with it. I'm already doing all kind of mental things, I'm always telling myself there's no reason to react like that, but I do it anyway and it, honestly, makes me feel rather pathetic.      So what can I do to stop getting so overemotional in these situations? If I can't do anything for that, can I at least change my diet or something so that I don't get red so easily?

20090203085700AAWSE8t	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	How can you heal a wound FAST?	I'm not exactly sure how it happened but basically about 2 months ago i popped a pimple. This left a flat red mark until recently. The red mark was going away and then one day there was this very small raised brownish/red bump. After a few days of picking at it it peeled off. Along with the rest of the skin there. Now there is a small hole that looks like i picked a scab off. It is pink in color. It's sore to the touch. I do not know what it is but i don't think it's anything to serious. It just looks like i picked a scab on my face. But anyway how can i make it heal faster, it's really noticeable and doesn't cover with makeup. I got it about 2 days ago. It seems slightly raised around the edges of the wound. What is it and how can i heal it faster?

I used to drink (when i lived in the USA) 5 bottles of regular mountain dew a day (and it really showed on my butt too, i gained so much weight) then i switched to diet coke when i moved here (thank goodness mountain dew isnt available) but i was still drinking like a liter a day. Now I drink one bottle a day. I also drink 2-3 liters of water a day. My question is, well two questions      1) why is diet soda so bad for a diet if it has no calories or sugar?   2) will ONE 16 ounce CAN a day really hurt my diet that much?      thanks.

Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?    I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..     I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.    I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.    Should i seek therapy?

My sister has always displayed some symptoms of autism, and so my mom has been trying to get her diagnosed since she was severn. But our first attempt turned out to show she hadnt got it...how ever after we left it for a year and she continued to get worse and more and more violent with it, we got a call saying that the board that had assesed her had been removed due to the bad way they were assesing children.       We were given a new psychologist but she seems worse that the others and completely clueless to the way my sisters violence can esculate and the fact she is repeatedly dangerous and could do some serious damage to our family. The past 3 appointments she has cancelled and my parents are getting fed up. Id like to know if anybody can diagnose her from my info or has had a similar experience???      My sis' info.      She is now 15...Her maths and science ability is far above average but everything else lacks greatly.....She considers an A at school a fail....Her mood can go from kind and caring to holding a knife up threatening to hurt you (she never actually has).....She gets bullied cos she cant understand a joke....She finds it impossible to tidy her room as she can visualise the end product.....She has bad personal hygiene because she still can wash her hair properly and so avoids it....Shes very immature (my dad doesnt feel safe letting her into town as she gets lost...i was allowed in to town at 12)...She has Very bad sense of direction......She doesnt understand proper friendship or when people are annoyed at her.      This isnt an exhausted list and I am aware its difficult to diagnose someone without meeting them, Id just like to know opinions.

20090203085818AA1QLJh	Health;Diet & Fitness	Fitness: HELP ME PLEASE.?	I'm 18 years old and I'm overweight. I've been obese since forever. Now, I really want to change that because being overweight affects me. It affects my self-esteem to a large measure & sometimes I avoid things that I want to do. I just graduated from high school and I'm entering college which starts this April.      Meaning, I'm meeting new people, making new friends & the most important part is, I have to go through orientation. I know I'm fairly good-looking for an overweight girl, at least I look presentable and neat. It's just that I don't want to make a fool out of myself just because I'm overweight.      Well, the point is, I really want a CHANGE. I'm 86kg, (FIY). Like I said earlier, I have a low self-esteem & I'm embarrassed to exercise, like to go for a jog. I used to go jogging in the morning, before sunrise, so that there won't be many people around in the park. However, NOW, I have trouble waking up early in the morning and usually I feel energized to exercise after going to work, afternoon. But I feel embarrassed to go for a job where there will be people who'll look at me & probably laugh & say, "OMG, this fat girl is trying to exercise!".       What do you suggest that I should as a START?

Yesterday I noticed a perfectly round little lump of skin hanging off the inside of my lip, barely attached. I chewed on it throughout the day, and it became really red and the whole side of my lip became sore. So this morning, when it was still hurting, I decided to cut it off with nail clippers (since it was barely attached anyways). So I cut the thing off...and when I pulled the nail clippers from my skin, this really thin white string came with it, and started coming out of the inside of my lip! It just kept coming, it was really long, and finally it broke and receded back into my lip tissue. What was that?!?!? A nerve?

I have some phlegm that gathers in my throat, and is cleared by a harsh series of coughs that cause pain in my chest and neck area, and my throat feels rough and laid open to the nerves. I have constant neck and chest pressure, with pain in my throat. Breathing is difficult, and I sometimes have to take a very deep breath that is followed by more coughing. My voice is still rough, scratchy, and low. Swallowing causes the pain in my throat to get worse, as does talking and breathing. I have no sinus blockage, nausea, fever, but I do have a headache that I took ibuprofen for, so it is getting better.    I was exposed to strep throat on Friday, by two people in the early stages of it. However, I know that strep usually isn't accompanied by a cough. What could it be?

Heart disease is the #1 killer of women, don't you think there would be more light shed on this subject?

20090203090110AA0Dg5F	Health;Women's Health	I have an inconstant period, and it is not pregnancy, any ideas as to what maybe the cause?	I am a 19 year old female, and i have noticed something a little odd about my menstrual cycle. My normal period will start off very heavy, and loose pace by the end,  to where it is normal. But from February to about April, it is very light almost nonexistent. It has been this way for as long as I can remember. It is not pregnancy, because i have only been sexually active the past year, and this has happened years before.      I wonder if it has something to do with my birthday being in February, or the moon, seeing as how my cycle follows the full moon.      Does anyone have an idea as to the cause?

I'm not sure if this is still the case but I remember that on tubes of toothpaste I used to see the words "Accredited by the South African Dental Association" or something like that. I always used to wonder what was so special about the South African Dental Assoc. that a huge brand like Colgate for example would feel the need to let everyone know it had been approved by them. Are they world leaders in dental health or something?
