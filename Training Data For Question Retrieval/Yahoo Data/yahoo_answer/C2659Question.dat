20090205011506AA9PL2T	Pets;Dogs	What dog is right for me?	Hello there,   I wanted to buy a cute puppies dog. Can any dog lover advise me please on what it takes to won one. I would like something not too hypo unlike jack Russel's, I Love the friendly border collies but I would like a different puppies colour something not many people have. Do any one have doggies for sale in Australia? Something easy to Martainn, we like the fluffy one but not to fluffy. We have a huge backyard and a fence two sides of it but the other half it is the corner part of our block. I love walking them and training animals. I know someone who can make his cattle dog walk with his ducks! Something medium size like a golden retriever but they might cost too much unfortunately. I would like a good breed. Works well with young children. A good looking one as well not like a ugly pug.       Please send me your answers! Good luck!

I have a flea bitten grey horse he gets these little tiny black dots all over his face and legs from time to time they are greasy sorta and do not come off, it looks like greasy dirt on his skin/fur.      I can get some out with shampoo and brushing but not many and i don't wanna hurt his skin by over shampooing.      Anyone have any idea what it is? the people at the barn say it's just dirt i think last time the vet looked and said the same thing. but how do i remove them??      this really buggs me because i'm like a clean freak the rest of him is sparkling.      Also we live in the desert and have little wind it is NOT sand the barn is all grass and his stall has normal shavings.      WHAT IS IT?      Thanks

I am an experiencess hawker i just dont know what to do in this situation! I Know they are ill from the fact that they let me close enough to touch them and even then didnt fly away!

20090204221506AASCrYX	Pets;Reptiles	Larval Tiger Salamander or Mud Puppy?	I've recently acquired a creature from a local bait shop, and I'm trying to figure out what he is.      Location: Northern Minnesota      Size: About 7 inches from mouth to end of tail.      Color: Greenish Grayish Brown with Yellowish Brown spots. He also has lines that go across his body kind of like ribs.       Other Characteristics: 4 toes on his front legs, and five on his back legs. He has 3 things that kind of look like dreads on his gills. He does not have eyelids.         At first glance I was almost sure he was a Mud Puppy- but his gills aren't really feathered like what I've seen in my research, and also he has 5 toes on his back feet and the research I've done tells me that Mud Puppies have 4.      Can anyone give me a hand on this?

20090205015926AAxBrVW	Pets;Cats	How can I get my cat to sleep through the night?	I have a cat who's just about 6 months old and is driving my girlfriend and I insane. The past month he'll wake up at 2am meowing loud as anything and not go back to sleep until during the day and is extremely intent on one of us being awake with him. He's very stubborn and wont stop and to wake us up he'll lick our noses and meow right by our faces at night. He used to be fed at around 6:00 cause that's when my girlfriend would wake up so naturally that's when he was getting his meals. We give him wet food twice a day but he has dry food out all the time. His excessive meowing and face licking is driving the two of us crazy. We cant leave him outside our door because he'll sit there and meow and not stop at all. I know he's a young cat and this is why I want to break him of this while he's young cause we cant take this. Please any help would be greatly appreciated.

My puppy got 2 of his shots today.  I accidentally pinched his shoulders where he was vaccinated at (I pulled him away because he was about to eat a chocolate chip on the floor). His shoulders were the first thing I grabbed. He is a tiny puppy.  He yelped a little, and I felt so bad...      Now my question is, will the vaccine come out of his shoulders since I pinched it hard accidentally?  Should I get him vaccinated again?            I learned my lesson already.  I want to be brave enough to ask this question to many criticizing people here on YA for the sake of my puppy. Please no rude/mean answers.

20090204214752AAg5yxe	Pets;Rodents	I rescued a Degu who is lame and has cataracts. I was told it will reverse if I change her diet. Any truth?	I got a Degu from a friend who didn't want it. I googled it and found out that they were a social animal so I took "her" to the pet store where "she" was from to find a companion. The man was poorly educated and told me I had a female and showed me a male about the same size, so I got him. It was a BAD match. So I went back for another cage and to get now 2 females. One is healthy and fine, but the other I noticed after I got her home and into the light has cloudy eyes. I assume it's cataracts. I was told If I change her diet it might reverse. Is this true and if not is there any thing else I can do?

20090204214747AAJte3U	Pets;Dogs	Adopting a Senior German Shepherd - I want to save a dog, and for the dog to protect my home and myself - HOW?	I live in a transitional neighborhood that has seen an uptick in crime. I use many preventative measures. I have asked around, and one of the biggest deterrants are dogs. Mainly Pit Bulls, Rots, GS, Dobermans.      I don't want to have a dog for 15 years and I have an awesome cat who I hang out with all the time.      I found a senior female GS at a shelter that likes cats & can be happy in & outdoors. I see that trying to train the dog to attack is not the right method, but I want it to be very intimidating to tresspassers & tear anyone apart who might break in, or at least get them to leave. How should I go about making sure this old dog's guard dog instincts are sufficient to provide a good deterant? Any training tips? I will give it lots of love and take great care of it, but if it won't serve as a decent guard dog, I will have to find a non-rescue, which would not be the best for the dog or me.      Thanks and I'm not trying to get the dog to attack on command so don't go there pls
20090204214920AAf9eZF	Pets;Reptiles	My aquatic turtle is not basking, is something wrong?	I just got my red eared slider turtle a couple of days ago. She has a water heater set at 78 degrees Fahrenheit, a filter, a thermometer, a heat lamp, day lamp, and a pretty large deck. I tested each item before I placed her in the tank. When I purchased her I was told to place her on the deck at first so she knew where is was and everything. So I did, but she just scampers right off every time I place her there. She also swims very hard, nearly into the walls of the tank, which is 15-20 gallons. Is it normal for her to not bask while still getting used to the environment or should I be worried? And is the violent swimming the way that she gets used to her environment, or is she begging or what?   I probably sound like a nervous parent, but i'd rather be safe than sorry.

20090204224737AAO5muM	Pets;Other - Pets	Can I make my horse's gaits smoother?	I own a 10 year old Appaloosa mare who has extremely up-and-down strides and is just a pain to ride.  She is a great horse, she learns fast and is very affectionate and sweet, but when I ride her for too long of a time my back begins to hurt because she is too rough.  I ride western, and I do endurance riding, no show.        It is not only her trot, her walk is short-strided and fast, plus she doesn't engage her hindquarters as much as she should at any gaits.  Her trot is horrible, and her canter is just too rough, it is a rocking motion, but it is head jolting when her feet hit the ground, particularly her hind legs, and amazingly bouncy.  She is like this whether she is going slow or fast, collected or extended, and I'm worried that I will have to sell her to insure that I don't cause any permanent damage to my back.  Is there any way I can make/help her to be smoother?

The part that kills me is that if we leave her one her bed tied to the front door shes great no pee or poo's anywhere! But just when I think I can leave her off the leash and just be home she poos and pees! On top of that when we get home she knows she did wrong and sulks and gives that general look of "I know I'm in trouble". We take her out 4 or 5 times a day. Twice in the AM before work first thing after waking and after she eats and then again at night right when I get home and after she eats before I go to bed. Occasionally I can get home to take her out but its not always a sure thing. I've used carpet cleaners and even rented a pro wet vac a month ago to be sure no smell or stains linger. Somebody please help me! I know it not a bladder thing I just took her to the vet to be fixed and shots updated last month and she passed with flying colors!

20090205001702AAfvJEu	Pets;Dogs	Do you view me as a bad dog owner?	I am considering leaving my male german shepherd pup intact, and possibly breeding him in the future. Now, before you judge, here is why:      I have an 18 month old male purebred german shepherd. He does not come from working lines and is not show quality, plus he had panosteitis, so I of course neutered him.      We just purchased a 13 week old purebred shepherd. He comes from strong working german lines, and his father was a Beautiful czech import. His mother OFA tested at Excellent, and his father received a Good. His parents were not titled, but all his grandparents were titled at at least Schutszhund 1.       At the age of 6 months, we have the option through our vet to do a pinpoint hip test, and from there all other needed x-rays and genetic health tests. We are also looking at getting him in to Schutzhund training. I have my older male in protection training right now, so we are use to a lot of the training. If our pup excels titles, and passes all his health tests, we will put him up for stud to well-qualifying bitches only. If not, then we will have him neutered ASAP      Am I a bad dog owner or a responsible dog owner?

20090205001728AA4R8KD	Pets;Dogs	My dog needs to be put down?	Had a vet come over this afternoon to check out my almost 17 year old border collie.    for a while now his back legs give way on him and he falls over, sometimes its hard for him to get up. It dosent happen as often outside, but we have had to have him inside due to the heat lately. he can still walk around and even jog around.     The vets say that it will just keep getting worse to the point that he wont be able to get up( i know this, im not stupid). And he has basicly no muscle left around his back legs.    Besides his legs, all that is wrong with him is that he cant hear. but that dosent affect him at all.     They want to put him down in the next couple of days, the would of even done it tonight (my birthdays 2moro, so no way!). I am completely heart broken, iv had my baby since i was 2. hes not just a dog, hes part of my family.    im probably in a bit of denial here, but does he need to be put down this soon??? he isnt in alot of pain, i can tell because when he is he dosent like people around and he growls a bit. i just dont feel like its THAT bad yet. i mean, hes still with it in the head, he can see fine, he eats fine and everything else. I look at him looking back at me and wagging his tail and i just dont think i could let them put him down.    what do you think?    sorry for such a long post
20090204230746AAcKxTu	Pets;Dogs	Did I do the right thing?	I adopted my dog when she was 5 years old, from the local pound. When she was 11, she had a terrible respitory infection for 9 weeks. We almost lost her then, but nursed her 'round the clock, having followed the advice of our regular vet, a specialist in respitory and heart problems, and a holistic vet.  Three months after her sickness started, she looked and acted fine and all the vets were surprised she had regained her health.       However, this was the beginning of the end. She lived for two more years (13 years old) when I put her down. By that time both her vision and hearing were failing, she was often confused/dazed, had lost control of her bowels and bladder, slept most of the time  and had been on heart meds for two years.       I have thought of her every single day since last August, when we buried her. Four months prior to that, in April, I was involved in a serious car accident where I broke 4 ribs and had my jaw wired shut for months, among other injuries.I also had several bouts with pneumonia during that time.  In retrospect, I feel the last four months I had with her were sad for her. I couldn't pick her up and play with her. I became irritated at her frequent accidents in the house and scolded her. I feel now if I had been healthy during that time that I would have had the strength and patience to deal with her problems, seek more medical advice, or at least make her last months more enjoyable and loving. Sometimes I feel so guilty, like I put her down because it was convenient for me to do so at the time. I loved her with all my heart and it breaks my heart if she thought I didn't love her those last few months when I was too injured and sick to be much company. I guess my question is: did I do the right thing?

20090204230707AA8KlnN	Pets;Dogs	Is this a BYB, and have you ever heard of a "co-ownership arrangement" before?	I'm not interested in this person's proposal, its just that I haven't heard of this before.      Does the potential co-owner have to pay for the dog's food and vet fees, or is it like the way a foster home is for a shelter dog, where the co-owner just provides the home, training and love?      I've heard that real breeders only breed show quality dogs, and I don't see anything about taking the puppy to dog shows.       Here is what she wrote on her pet classified add:      "__________ is looking for an experienced competitor for a co-ownership arrangement on a breeding prospect female from our recent litter of athletic (field-trial line) Labradors.      People who are active in field trials, hunt tests, or agility would be considered ideal candidates for this offer. This will be an attractive ownership arrangement on one of our pick females.      This litter was whelped Jan 22, 2009. The puppy will be selected and available to go to her new home on or after March 13th. In the meantime, our puppies are handled daily and undergo early neurological stimulation. They are well-socialized and will be up to date on vaccinations and dewormings and vet-checked prior to departure from our home."

20090204225309AAITaMU	Pets;Cats	Cat Hairballs, is food change to blame?	I have a 14 year old male cat, who is also slightly overweight. He has a history of pancreatitis, which occurred in 2003. Several months ago, I switched him from Science Diet, which was doing nothing for his health or his weight, to Halo. Since he has been eating Halo, he has lost some weight, and is much more active and happy. It has made a noticeable improvement. The only problem is, since being switched to Halo, he suddenly has a hairball problem. He's never had hairballs before, and I now find at least one a week. Is the food change to blame & what can I do to help him?    And I know taking him to the vet would be the obvious answer. I have called, and he just wants to run test after test. I'm not going to put my elderly cat through any tests, unless I have already exhausted all other options. He is not a good patient, they have to sedate him to even examine him. And he's just too old for the stress of a visit to the vet. So any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

20090204233656AAKqTwc	Pets;Dogs	Gave my female and male dogs baths and all of a sudden the female got aggresive?	I gave my female dog (a boston terrier) a bath who we think might be pregnant (her and my male boston mated while she was in heat like 2 1/2 weeks ago)  then I gave my other male dog a bath and all of a sudden like an hour later she looked at my male dog all crazy and attacked him with a lot of mean angry fierce.  I have never seen her act this way.... then about 3 hours later she attacked him again.  she looks at him like she doesn't know him. Do you think it is because she doesnt recognize his scent? I dont know whats goin on here.  She is sleeping all of the time and when I take her to the dog park she wants nothing to do with any other dog and doesnt run or play.  Help.

20090205002617AA8IHxR	Pets;Dogs	Is this normal after a spay surgery?	I asked a question on here yesterday morning about what to expect after a spay surgery. I have a few more questions today. My dog had the surgery yesterday morning @ 10am. The vet called and said she bled more than normal but should be fine. She came home @ 3 with a pink bandage around her waste, covering gauze at the incision. The vet said she could eat a little at 7pm and the bandages could be taken off @ 9pm.       She didnt eat until 8:30 but afterwards, I noticed that above her bandage her stomach was so swollen. The bandages were way too tight, I couldnt even put my finger between it and her.  I took the bandage off as soon as I noticed this and it just had quite a bit of dried blood on it, no fresh blood though and her stitches look fine.  This morning her stomach still looks bloated. Ive already called the vet and left a message with the answering service. Is it normal for her to look bloated, am I just over reacting?       Also she has not gone pee either. She has been drinking little amounts of water at a time and I was hoping that she would have gone pee by now. 3:30am. The vet did say it could take a while for her bladder to start working again, but shouldnt she have gone pee by now?      She is acting fine, Still a little sleepy but she has walked around the room some and everytime I look at her she wags her tail. She doesnt seem to be in any pain either

20090205032045AAjZmPs	Pets;Dogs	Medium size sporty dog breeds that would suit a small house?	I'm a long way away from getting a dog but I'm thinking about it in the future. I'm moving to a flat (apartment), it is two level but still pretty small. I'm not really keen on small foo foo dogs or terriers, other half doesnt like greyhound-type dogs or lab/golden retrievers. Have lived with springer and cocker spaniels all my life, adore them but would like to try a different breed if possible. Cross breeds are fine too, I plan to check out the local shelters. Basically I would like a dog thats up to medium size, easy to train, that I can do agility with and exercise 1 and a half to 2 hours a day. I love collies, but dont think its really fair to keep them in a flat. Also like Duck Tollers, but not sure if they would settle in a flat...basically I need a dog that, although it is active, will be reasonably calm around the house, and not bark loads (afraid of annoying neighbours).      I'm very demanding aren't I?
20090205071809AA9cchS	Pets;Dogs	DESPERATE...help with min pin (pics)?	I have a 2 year old, 5 lb min pin who ive had since he was 12 weeks old. He goes potty outside when were home (well, he wont poop outside, just pees, he waits until we leave to poop, no matter how long hes out there for, and hes does have a coat). When we leave, he will go potty (pee and poop) in his crate and lay in it (no matter how small the crate). He will also eat wee wee pads or just poop next to them. He wont use the doggy door because its cold out and he would rather poop inside where its warm. He wont use a litter box he just goes next to it.       He used to be fine until he ran away a year ago during winter for 3 days. When he came home, he was extremely skinny. I took him to the vet and he tested negative for heartworms but does have a heart murmur. He also had to have the ball (head) of his femur removed because somehow when he ran away he twisted his leg which cut off blood flow and the bone died. The only medical problem we know of is the slight heart murmur. He also has no hair on his belly or knees on his back legs. He also has minimal hair in front of his ears.       Right now he is home with his brother (mo other dog) and they are baby gated in a room with tile floor, dog beds, and toys. there is wee wee pads on the floor although he still pees/poops on the floor. We have a baby coming and are at our wits end about what to do with potty training...as he was trained before he ran away. He is still pretty skinny no matter what I feed him (ive tried everything, but now they eat Nutro food), but otherwise acts normal and happy. Any suggestions and do you think he has an underlying medical issue? NO RUDE COMMENTS PLEASE! THIS IS SERIOUS!       http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...        http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...        http://s625.photobucket.com/albums/tt331...

20090205022909AA3lvop	Pets;Dogs	Re: Chocolate Lab New today! So Sad Circumstances though...?	Today I looked out the window to see if it snowed again. Just then I saw someone had dumped or dropped off a beautiful Chocolate Labador Retriever down on the highway in front of my house. I didnt catch what kind of vehicle it was because I was watching the dog. He came to my house immediately. I wasnt sure if he was gonna keep on going past my property just cutting through. I yelled to my husband to warn our child about him because she was just about to walk our dog to go potty and she is only 12. I didnt know if he  was friendly or not. Well to my suprise by the time I got out there he was playing with my daughter. She came back in and I checked on him a few minutes later and he was still there laying down on my pool deck cover trying to warm himself because of the ice on the ground. We are in the midst of a horriable Ice snow storm recovery, most do not have electric and alot of animals have been given to shelters because of it. So Im thinking this is what happened. All of my animals except my horses have come to me by people just dumping them at the end of my drive. Its so sad. But I keep them all.I did find a home for the brother of the first dog that was dumped together a year and half ago. Anyways so to my suprise my husband said to bring the lab in the house because he was so friendly and obviously decided to stay and the weather is not appropriate for animals to be out in. So I did!! (I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED A CHOCOLATE LAB SO I AM SO HAPPY) The previous owners must have had a really hard time giving this dog up because he was very well cared for. Meaning he was groomed! His nails are trimmed the fur around his paws trimmed, his ears are spottlessly clean, his coat shiney ect. The only thing is he needed a bath as he smelled like a dog...we have been out of electric for 2 weeks now. So who knows the circumstances of the previous owners. He was so cold and shivering so I turned on the shower and he went right in and sat down and loved his shower. Then he made himself right at home from in front of the fire to on the couch ( I didnt let him stay there but it was so cute...) I fed him and he ate well and he drank alot of water.He has shown to love kids, cats,horses,dogs and even tolerates my scared smaller dogs growling behavior, which we are keeping a close eye on till he relaxes. He was dropped off with a running mate black lab but that one kept on going and never stopped at my house. I hope he found someone nice to shelter him as it is 8* out there tonite. The only thing is I havent been able to get the chocolate lab to go to the bathroom. He has now been here all night and Ive walked him at least 6 times to no avail. so I put him up for the rest of the night in a large kennel in the kitchen just so there wont be any accidents while we sleep. He is such a sweet dog and we will take real good care of him. We named him Ceasar after our favorite dog whisperer... I guess I will take him in to the vets for a check up to make sure he is healthy tomorrow. Hope you like my story. Thanks for reading!

20090205064815AAAenFd	Pets;Dogs	Almost 4 Month Old Puppy Just Started Limping?	My 4 month old puppy was outside on my porch with his sister and their mom. When I looked outside, he and his mom were sitting on the couch, and the sister was at the door. So, I opened the door, and the sister came in, the mom jumped off the couch, and he jumped off the couch. When he and the mom were coming over to the door, I noticed that he was limping rather prominently. When he got in I picked him up and kept him away from the other 2 so I could try to figure out what might have happened. So, I backed up from him and he came walking over to me, not limping quite as bad. But then when he turned around to go the other way, he was limping badly again. I assume it's his back right leg because when he limps he sort of drifts to the right.       I'm almost certain the jump down from the couch did something to his leg. (note..this just happened about 30 minutes ago). Is there any reason to be concerned, and what can I do?      And he's not showing any pain when I touch his back right leg, or his hip, or any other leg or foot.
20090205034113AAZCepF	Pets;Dogs	Question about our dog growling? Long but PLEASE read.?	Hi, we have a 2 year old VERY timid jack russell crossed with a cairn.   She is timid that she is frightened of almost everything!   Well we have a 10 week old baby and she has been fine with him she actually just ignores him and only occasionally goes up to him and sniffs him sometimes.   Well last night our baby was on my husbands lap and our dog was sitting next to him and I was the other side of her. She was sniffing our baby and we let her as we dont want her to think he is anything to be scared of. He started crying and she carried on sniffing him but then shw went to jump off the sofa but as she did she turned to him and growled at his face. She didnt touch him at all and her mouth wasnnt open or showing any teeth she just did a little nudge towards him and jumped off.I know she had no intention of biting because as I said she didnt have her mouth open or showed teeth but it still shocked us so much.   She has done the same to me on some occasions if I wake her when she is sleeping she will growl a little and "headbutt" me but we know she would never bite as she is the sort of dog that children can pull around and climb over and she would just walk away.   I just wondered if anyone who knows dogs could explain why she did this - was it because he was crying and she was saying "shut up" or maybe it was because she felt penned in as she was sitting between us, as I have noticed since that when our baby cries she gets up and leaves the room quickly.   Any insight or advice would be appreciated.

20090205024726AAD95pS	Pets;Rodents	I need to convince my boyfriend that rats are good pets...?	My mom always talked about how she had rats, squirrels, ferrets, etc. when she was growing up. Ya know, rodents with personality. Lately I've been trying to talk my boyfriend into letting me get one. And he's completely "ICK" about the idea.       His only pets growing up were fish and a tarantula. So even explaining why dogs and cats are good pets is tough!      I firmly believe in the phrase, "If you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet." So I have no intention of running out to buy one tomorrow.      I would just like some good firm facts about what makes them good pets.

He likes to sleep in it and he does not mind being locked in the crate while i am driving but he wants out when he wakes he will go into it to get his toys and will play with them for a little while inside it but he normally brings them out or comes out without them.       Should i use a pen in an other room instead of a crate or is he to young to leave on his own in an other room ? i have him 6 days . should i try and crate train him (closed door)during the day where he can wine as much as he wants and just increase the time he spends in there. (noise is a massive no no at night in the apartment block i live in)   I have tried the closed  door approach at night and he wined and barked and soiled the crate he was very upset.    Now i leave him in the bed room with the crate open. He sleeps in the crate mostly after i put him in it and comfort him when he wakes up and i put him back in. He whines to get into the bed when he wakes.. i do not mind him being in the bedroom but i do not want him in the bed.but defo wants into the bed      Will he sleep longer as time goes on? .

20090205030701AAOApWD	Pets;Fish	Do I need more or less fish for my tank?	I have a 55 gallon tank... I have 75 gal. filter system in it, a heater with an adjustable thermostat, a thermometer that I just put in there, 55 tsp. of aquarium salt, about 30 lbs. of gravel, and fake plants and a large cave-y type rock as decorations.      The fish I have in it are a 4" pleco, two fully grown dwarf gouramis, two baby gold gouramis (about an inch and a half long each), and three mixed fruit tetras (I'll admit that I didn't do any reading on them until after I got them and now that I have I feel absolutely terrible about getting them -- they're very pretty but I'm sad that they won't live very long or even keep their color).      Do I have too many fish for this size tank? I may return the tetras (I just bought them a few hours ago, put them in my tank, and then read about the horrible way they got their beautiful coloration...) as soon as possible, but I don't know if I can take them back to Wal Mart. I'm not sure of the return policy on fish.      Or, should I get MORE fish for the tank? I am starting to really like gouramis, and I'd love to get more varieties if I knew for sure that I had the capacity for them. So, if you think I SHOULD get a couple more fish, what type do you think I should get? Again, I'm leaning towards gouramis but anything else that's pretty and NOT dyed would be loved.

20090205040518AA632P6	Pets;Dogs	One for the Breeders?	I have been contacting several Boxer breeders in the state(NC).  I have began a search to find a puppy to train as a seizure response dog for my husband.  The trainers have suggested that I look for a puppy that has been allowed to stay with mom until it is 9 weeks old.  I have only found one so far that will even continue the conversation in regards to the puppy after I state my intentions with an open mind.  Others insist on charging an outrageous amount per a day in response to the request.        My question I guess is this.  If someone came to you with the intention of training one of your pups as a service dog;  What would you do?  This question is open to ALL breeders since many dogs that are too small for some service work make great therapy dogs.  This would give the pup purpose and a stable home since service animals are not pets, they are a life line.

20090205064508AALVWqb	Pets;Dogs	How do I make my emaciated dog healthy?	I just bought a very skinny white husky from the pound as it was being taken in the back (you know why). It had been in there for two weeks and after that amount of time they euthanize them to make more "room" for other dogs. It was still very skinny and I couldn't figure out why. I bought it a big bag of dog food and a variety of wet dog food from petsmart. He will NOT touch the dry dog food. He woofed down two cans of wet dog food (I didnt know untill I recently searched that you should feed them smaller portions). This morning I tried to feed him purina wet food and he wouldnt touch it. I brought my labs in to meet him and they started eating the food, and after that he ate a little bit more. He went to the restroom last night, but i took him out this morning and he collapsed on the floor. He got up right away but started to limp on his right back paw. He then tried to go to the restroom but couldnt go. He seemed to be struggling for 30 seconds and then gave up. I took him inside and he slept and woke up and seemed fine. He no longer limped or seemed tired. I took him out again and he still couldnt go to the restroom, but other than that seemed fine. He still wont eat dry food, and nibbles at the wet food. I am stuck at school from 8-3 and i have work from 3:30 to 11.  My mother refuses to get involved and my dad doesnt even want the dog. I refuse to take it back to the pound and I cant find anyone to take care of it. I feel it is best with me but it is hard to find time. I will be moving out next year and on my way to college and then I will have plenty of time but as for right now I have very little time and I have no idea what to do. Any suggestions?
20090205070938AA83oUx	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat go crazy when I blow?	I noticed once when I started blowing with my lips (as if you cooling your dinner down) Its never directly at him, but my cat went crazy, his male and nearly 2 years old, he can be a distance away but soon as he heres the sount of anyone blowing he will start marching around really fast meowing, rolling about, and attaching everything is sight, and his a very gentle cat. Has anyone noticed this before with their cats or heard of this? and does anyone no why, as I am very interested to know. Thanks!
20090412100852AAfMJGU	Pets;Horses	Question about being in shape vs being bigger built?	Okay I'll get the messy work outta the way. . .    1. if your not going to answer the question, then don't bother unless you can make me laugh, then feel free to rant about whatever you want.   2. If your going to insult me, please come up with someone more original then the others who have tried today.   3. do you think I should keep these things attached to all my questions for the random people who can't get over themselves?      ~~~~~~~~~~   Real question:   I was reading again, (shock of ages I can read). . . And one complain of a top trainer was people being out of shape and riding.  Now my question is : Is that everyone who is bigger/fatter/heavier/whatever term you choose to use, wrong for riding horses? or is it just for people who are out of shape no matter what their size (yes you can be out of shape and be smaller size).   The reason I ask is cause yes I am bigger (shoot me I have a chest), and I am not hugely heavy. Do I have to stop riding and go to the gym more before it's considered safe for me to ride? Or can I say heck I work on a farm, live on another farm, work and go to school... so I should be safe to ride because I'm not totally out of shape?      one last question/thought: Is anyone else who is bigger framed and not a striaght line tired of people telling them they're hurting themselves and their horses? I mean isnt riding exersize and they don't want us to exersize, and shouldn't bigger framed people (trying to be P/C and not say fat...) get out more anyway? cutting off that form of getting out/moving seems counter productive.       (note: I'm not talking about those huge people who ride smaller horses, or those huge people who ride in a cart behing mini's. I'm talking about a bigger rider who fits the size of the horse)
