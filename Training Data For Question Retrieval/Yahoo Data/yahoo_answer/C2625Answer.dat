v905m6jRaa	starboard    O.E. steorbord, lit. "side on which a vessel was steered," from steor- "rudder, steering paddle" + bord "ship's side." Cf. O.N. stjornborei, Low Ger. strbord, Ger. Steuerbord. Early Germanic peoples' boats were propelled and steered by a paddle on the right side. Fr. tribord (O.Fr. estribord), It. stribordo are Gmc. loan-words.     port (1)    "harbor," O.E. port "harbor, haven," reinforced by O.Fr. port, both O.E. and O.Fr. from L. portus "port, harbor," originally "entrance, passage," from PIE *prtu- "a going, a passage," from base *per- "to lead, pass over" (cf. Skt. parayati "carries over;" Gk. poros "journey, passage;" L. porta "gate," portare "passage;" Avestan peretush "passage, ford, bridge;" Armenian hordan "go forward;" Welsh rhyd "ford;" O.C.S. pariti "fly;" O.E. faran "to go, journey," O.N. fj?rer "inlet, estuary"). Meaning "left side of a ship" is attested from 1543, from notion of "the side facing the harbor" (when a ship is docked). It replaced larboard in common usage to avoid confusion with starboard (q.v.); officially so by Admiralty order of 1844 and U.S. Navy Department notice of 1846. Fig. sense "place of refuge" is attested from 1426; phrase any port in a storm first recorded 1749.    [I've always thought there was a connection with the use of port in "port arms" -- meaning carry the item (weapon) pointing to the left.]    bow (n2.)    "front of a ship," 1342, from O.N. bogr or M.Du. boech "bow of a ship," lit. "shoulder (of an animal)," the connecting notion being "the shoulders of the ship."    stern (n.)    c.1300, "hind part of a ship, steering gear of a ship," probably from O.N. stjorn "a steering," related to styra "to guide" (see steer (v.)). Or the word may come from O.Fris. stiarne "rudder," which is also related to steer (v.).|`|V4mSLkXdaa	I can only answer part of your question:    Starboard - Named as such after a contraction called a Steering Board, from ancient ships. This was a Rudder like contraption that was situated on the right side of the vessel (as the left or Port side of the vessel needed to be kept free for tieing up to the Dock)  You might try this website as it is full of maritime information  www.bosunsmate.org|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	Nautical terminology dates from the 17th century.

As conditions for recirculating these exhaust gases are within an operational range value, the valve allows the proper recirculation when presets are satisfied.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	This may web page or site be of some help.        http://www.cummins-sp.com/engines/automo...

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	It doesnt have much choices, right?    The landing is a controlled collision with the planet in such a way the impact energies are minimized. The airplane comes to contact with the landing surface as much parallel as practical and as slow as possible. The aerodynamics of the airplane as designed for this. The answerer above have given the finer details.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	It does it just the way it was designed to do it.|`|U24VtSlZaa	With the application of just the right amount of thrust from the engines, the plane will descend gradually while moving forward.  It follows a path that intersects with the ground at the near end of the runway.    When the plane is moving forwards with the leading edge of the wings angled up, the wings are pushing air down.  "Flaps" extended at the trailing edge of the wings increase the downward flow of air.      This downward flow of air is what keeps the plane aloft (Newtons 3rd law of motion;  the wing pushes air down, therefore the air pushes up on the wing).  When the plane gets very close to the runway, the airflow hits the ground and forms a sort of a cushion of air.      This is why you might feel the plane swaying and shaking as you approach, then suddenly it smooths out just before the wheels touch down.  The effect is especially noticeable in a smaller plane;  not so much on a large passenger jet because they have computers that make tiny corrections to compensate for the swaying.    Reduce thrust and fall gently (hopefully) to the ground.|`|8ZARrsnXaa	it takes a big nose dive at 100 mph.|`|ybVzFAhHaa	well the airplane slows down to the approach speed, then a few feet above the runway the pilot pulls the nose up gently in a flare. The wheels touch down and then the pilot applies brakes to stop it.|`|UntSb3E9aa	reduce the speed   flaps down to 30  this increses drag to is easyer to bring the plane down  speed brake this acts as a tool to increse decent rate  landing gear with good suspension  and slow down when you touch down|`|oM9jG13Jaa	wings of the airplane are designed to do so with the help of flaps and slats. these 2 parts of the wings increase lift and increase drag in a set amount of degrees. besides parts of the wing, speed also plays an important role to help an airplane lift and land smoothly on the runway. for a normal jet, speed for approach on to the runway is about 130 knots or less and propeller is about 70 knots or less. if want to know more try go browse through aviation website.|`|ouXfZxvXaa	gravity

BgwTxzEFaa	Never seen a defective one, except for perhaps a broken clip.    If fuel is flowing through it and it is not leaking, it is working.    If your vehicle wont start or runs poorly and you thought it was the fuel filter, and you replaced it and it still wont start, or still runs poorly, chances are the problem was not your fuel filter.|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	Believe it or not...sometimes a fuel filter can be attached backwards.  Have a good mechanic check it out.|`|YKQZ5RlOaa	If you think your fuel filter is defected, do the following test:  disconnect the fuel line from the fuel filter to the injectors.  have a container ready to catch the fuel so you don't spill it.  have someone Turn on the ignition switch and you or another person, watch for fuel coming out of the fuel line.  most of the time fuel comes out of it.  If it doesn't, disconnect the fuel line from the tank to the fuel filter and do the same testing.  If fuel comes out of it. It's the fuel filter.   If fuel doesn't come out of it. check for fuel in the tank, or the fuel pump.  good luck!

WKcC0Qayaa	pick one oil, change it and the filter regularly - do not change brands, grades or types.    check all fluid levels EVERY time you get fuel    keep your tires air'd up, but slightly below the max on the sidewall.    start and drive off gently immediately, do not idle, drive gently so that all of the systems get a chance to warm up    do not ride your brakes    coast to a stop when ever possible    when you do have to use your brakes - apply them firmly, then completely off them - this gives them a chance to cool down.  For example going down a long grade (like on I-80 into SLC or down into Sacramento) use lower gears, let the vehicle speed up to the speed limit, then brake down 10 or 15 mph in a short distance, then let the brakes cool while the vehicle slowly gains speed again.    change your air filter regularly.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Do not let it shorten yours|`|LV99y5ipaa	Don't abuse it.

However I can tell you that for 2 amps and a cap you should be using 4awg wire from the battery, then if the amps only require 8awg use a distribution block to divide the 4awg to 2 8awg wires at the amps.|`|jgXTrdS6aa	they are awesome!|`|JVOXcH11aa	Sounds like you will have a bangin' system, my friend!|`|GbZ4axroaa	what you could do is change from a 8 guage wire to a  4 guage or 1 if it is possible to the positive and negative wires from the battery to the amp it will give you more power or you could use one big amp to run both subs.
6xyeYjkkaa	Or maybe your heater core is partially clogged so that coolant isn't flowing through it fast enough to keep up with the air temp which cools it. Heater cores don't just go bad by leaking. Sometimes they clog and sometimes the valve which is operated by the temp control lever gets stuck almost closed and you don't get much circulation. I'd check the valve first then the core.|`|EPJ2RDDOaa	go to a mechanic|`|2daf1f643b0222e20fe97c10246019f0aa	Check  your thermostat.  It's the cheapest to replace and usually the cause of this low heat problem.|`|LV99y5ipaa	A coolant smell from your vents isn't good at all but that wouldn't stop it from getting hot unless it was plugged. Anyway, there are two hoses that come from your firewall to your engine. Those are your heater hoses. There should be a valve on one of the hoses that control the amount of water that is allowed to flow through your heater core. My guess is that valve is stuck or not being operated.|`|HlozHgwIaa	Get the engine to operating temp. turn the heat on fully to the HOT side. Check the hoses, they should both be hot. If one is hot and one is cold, heater core is clogged. If both cold, then coolant is not getting to the heater core and you need to check for low coolant or failing water pump.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	If you run the blue amp wire directly to the battery the amp will stay on all of the time.  Depending on the amp, this may be a severe drain on the vehicle battery.  The people who say you should find an accessory circuit are correct.  You only want the amp to come on when you have the ignition key on.  I would not run the blue amp wire directly to the battery, I would find a circuit that only has voltage with the ignition key on, to save your battery voltage, and only turn on the amp when the key is on.|`|LV99y5ipaa	A car battery puts out 13.8 volts at full charge.

A good, properly tuned exhaust is going to cost you several hundred $$.  You can't just go to an muffler shop because the exhaust must be properly "tuned" in a naturally aspirated motor or you're very likely lose power as opposed to gaining it.|`|XH4O3ozFaa	That is because they do not exist.

4J37Ytphaa	Well said Maverick.   I reckon it's common sense a lot of the time, if it's breaking over the harbour wall stay where you are, unlike the idiots  last year who left Whitby in a howling gale to head north in a small stink boat as in something like 18 ft after being told by the local mariners to stay there. They came back quickly but were not alive.  that was an expensive bit of ignorance on their part.  Yes a F 8 is not nice for a standard boating person, but having been on RAF ASR Launches for 12 years in the 1970's 80's I've seen most of the Prat yellow wellie brigade weather power or sail. so If you don't like it don't go. I've crossed the Bay of biscay in a F 10 plus  on a 40 ft Ketch and we were ok .all three were experienced Mariners. The best thing to do is speak to the HARBOUR MASTER  OR LOCAL LIFEBOATMEN if you know them before going any where.    Fair winds|`|RjUhISEIaa	Ice...that's it for us. If the marina is frozen in we're stuck but thinking about it we haven't ventured out in some of the hurricanes that have struck our area so let's add that to the list too. As for the rest...we've either headed out in inclement weather or been on the way in when it's hit.|`|U24VtSlZaa	If it's a thunderstorm in process, I leave the boat on the trailer.  I won't leave the marina until 5 minutes after the last sound of thunder.      My poor boat don't tolerate windspeeds upwards of 15 mph on the local reservoirs, so I'd need a darn good reason to go out on a windy day.    That's about it.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	Gale force and above personally.  Not real happy about lightning either.    Unfortunately I have to go and rescue people in these conditions who perhaps should not go out in less than those winds.  Like four hours ago - steering failed(? brand new owner installed) - engine died (just 'fully serviced'), anchors wrong type with little or no chain.    Oh well, he's alright so that's o.k., and air temp above 45 Celsius so didn't mind getting wet at all.

Would have to agree with thunderstorms, they pass by quickly so a few minutes waiting for them to clear is no problem.     I will not take passengers out with winds exceeding 20 knots, or large thunderstorms in the area.      Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	I sail on the North American Great Lakes.  The weather that will keep me in the marina depends on who I have for passengers / crew and what my mood is on that particular day.    I absolutely won't go out in winds over 30 kts, when there is a t-storm approaching on radar and if there's chop much over 5 feet.  Snow is pretty much a non-starter, but if everyone else wanted to go, I wouldn't say no.|`|D0sIVfofaa	It depends on where the marina is located. If it's in a bay there usually isn't a problem.

EDnT0y8caa	Basically, you simply get applications from the companies that you are interested in, you fill them out, submit them, and then hope you get called for an interview. Most of them can be filled out and submitted online. Knowing someone working for an airline that can give you a personal recommendation is a big help in getting your application looked at.     A college degree helps, but isn't absolutely required. A good appearance, good health, a positive outgoing attitude, friendliness, calmness under pressure, good study skills, a great smile, clear diction, good grammar and multiple languages are all big assetts. Drug, alcohol, personality or health problems, as well as any criminal record (including multiple traffic violations), and even bad credit can disqualify you.     Do not waste your money on a "flight attendant" school. If an airline (or corporate operator) likes you, they'll train you. In fact, by law, they have to do so, so why pay for what they have to give you anyway?     You'll find more than you can possibly absorb right here: http://www.thirtythousandfeet.com/flight...    Good luck!|`|K1prVAsjaa	Search online for flight attendant schools. Most airlines have their own because of unique training qualifications, but there are also independant schools.    If you are interested in working for a specific airline, contact them and ask. If you haven't thought about that yet, I suggest doing a little online research into the different airlines.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	I agree with been there, do NOT pay for one of those flight attendant schools!!  Many airlines will not hire from them, as they don't want you to have the wrong training before you get their training.  Just apply at the airlines.  Of course, not many are hiring right now, unless you want to work for a low cost carrier or move to Dubai.  You can also look into corporate aviation.  In the interest of full disclosure, it's not a great job.  It used to be thought of as glamorous, but it never really was.  You work long hours for low pay, and the airline considers your ability to travel cheap as part of your compensation.  You will be tired and hungry at work a lot, in a place that has no, or little food.  You will be forced to work with people you don't like, and be in a cramped environment with scared, unhappy and just plain mean customers.  Now, it's not all bad, and can be fun, but it's also very tedious.  And, you will be thought of as a glorified barmaid, even though you are trained to get people out of a burning or sinking aircraft.

He is a colossal pain in the side of Canadian authorities. Here is what our most respected paper has to say about him after they investigated him.    Major Keyvan's war  Keyvan Nourhaghighi has filed suits against CSIS, the police, the Canadian goverment -- and, for the past 15 years, his condominium. It's a dispute that's cost the building an estimate $200,000, dropped at least one owner's property values and driven his neighbours to utter frustration, with no end in sight. Peter Cheney reports.  PETER CHENEY     March 4, 2006    Peggi Lepage and Mark Mainguy appear to have all the ingredients of the good life, downtown Toronto-style: She's an ex-model who now works "on the other side of the camera," as they say. He's a television commercial director who had a film selected at Sundance. They have a cool place to live -- a sixth-floor condo with a living room set in the bell tower of a former Anglican church.    But there's a catch. That would be the 15-year dispute with their neighbour, Major Keyvan Nourhaghighi, a self-described former Iranian Air Force fighter pilot and amateur legalist who spends his days pursuing his own unique brand of justice.    Mr. Nourhaghighi has waged legal action against everyone from Canada's federal spy agency to the Toronto police force (which he accuses of torturing him) to Transport Canada (which he suspects of trying to kill him by sabotaging a private aircraft he flew from the Buttonville airport).    Unfortunately for Ms. Lepage, Mr. Mainguy and their fellow condominium owners, Mr. Nourhaghighi has also fixed his legal crosshairs on the building he shares with them. The fight between him and the condominium at 456 College St. has now raged for a decade and a half. "There's nothing normal about it," Mr. Mainguy says.     The legal battle has had many consequences. The value of Ms. Lepage's unit may have plunged by more than $100,000. One building official estimates the legal costs at close to $200,000.    And the tab keeps mounting. Just before Christmas, Ms. Lepage and Mr. Mainguy (along with the residents of the other 88 units in the building) paid a "special levy" to help defray the costs of defending the condominium building against Mr. Nourhaghighi's ongoing legal action. In Ms. Lepage and Mr. Mainguy's case, the levy came to $900.    Stress levels have red-lined -- one building official nearly burst into tears when asked about the case. "You have no idea," she said. "It's insane."    Earlier this week, Mr. Nourhaghighi met with a visitor to discuss his case. At 60, he still has the trim, intense presence of the F-4 Phantom jet pilot he says he once was. For more than an hour, he outlined his grievances, laying the blame for the building's legal woes entirely on the shoulders of his opponents, which include the management, many of his neighbours and the condominium board.    "They have never shown interest in having an honourable board," he said. "The people of Iraq supported Saddam Hussein, and then they suffered. . . . The people of Germany gave their vote to Hitler, and they suffered. Their country was destroyed. And these people are foolishly supporting the board."    Mr. Nourhaghighi carries with him a phone-book-sized legal dossier festooned with densely inscribed Post-It notes. "I have many powerful enemies to fight," he said.    His costs are limited, since he represents himself. Asked how many days he has spent in court on his action against the condominium building, Mr. Nourhaghighi said he lost count long ago: "Many," he said. "Many, many, many."    Mr. Nourhaghighi is no stranger to the courts. From his small sixth-floor unit, he has waged legal action against a list of opponents that includes Transport Canada, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the Queen, judges, prosecutors, police officers, jail guards, lawyers and the Canadian Human Rights Commission. He has also gone up against both CSIS (the Canadian spy agency) and SIRC (the agency that oversees it).    In 1997, Mr. Nourhaghighi was declared a "vexatious litigant" by an Ontario judge. The order against him means that he cannot file new lawsuits in Ontario without applying for court approval, but it doesn't prevent him from continuing with existing suits, filing appeals -- or asking for court approval to file new suits.    His legal siege against the condo development began in 1991, when he filed a complaint with the Ontario New Home Warranty Program shortly after buying his unit, charging that the building was improperly constructed. This complaint turned out to be the legal equivalent of the shooting of Archduke Ferdinand: Since those early days, the battle has produced thousands of documents and consumed untold court time, with no end in sight.

1PM0Qambaa	well unfortunately young man you fall in the highest liability class on the road today 16-25  average is for minimal coverage is gonna be anywhere from $125 to $200 a month|`|0B0ycKw3aa	If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.

7BHIyMFmaa	In addition to making the 4 door Bronco, Centurion also marketed an F-350 based 2 door Bronco. It had all the running gear of  an F-350 (Dana 60 front ,10,25 rear, HD springs/shocks, etc.) on a shortened F-350 frame and a Bronco body. The engines offered were the 460 and the powerstroke.  This is a doable swap, but you will defiantly need some stiffer front springs to handle the weight of the diesel, you'll need custom drive shafts, and you will need a 10.25 rear axle. This would also be an ideal time for a SAS up front. a straight Dana 44 HD would be strong enough, and cheap, but a Dana 60 would be ideal.     In short it's a cool project, but to do it right it won't be easy or cheap. There's a moderate amount of custom fabrication that will be needed. If the 7.3L you have is a turbo model, then it's worth it, if it's just an early non-tubro 7.3L then the swap doesn't make much sense.

Belts can be checked looking at the grooves in them.  Again, it all depends on what has been done lately to it.  Good luck.  I would also take it to a trusted mechanic and have him check out everything before buying the car.  If the seller hesitates that idea, don't buy it!!!|`|cRkLwDgZaa	you should firstly drive around in it, do all types of driving in it, hard soft, if all looks to be ok then just check the battery levels, look at the oil levels and see that they are not too dark but not too light, also check that all the screws and nuts and bolts are tight, just look at all the levels of power steering fluids and other fluids. look at the bonnet and the outside of the engine to see if there is alot of oil or stuff like that on the bonnet.     lastly look at the log book and service books to see when the last service was, if it was a long time ago you should just book it in to make sure that everything is ok with the engine, they will probably be able to spot things that you didn't know could become a problem.

VbV5MsICaa	i would honestly say go with the pioneer. i have a few reasons to back that up to. the l7 sounds awful. if someone would like to tell me that it doesnt sound awful and mushy. then id advise them to listen to something outside circuit city. honestly an RE sub is so much better. however down to bussiness. the pioneers if im right are 400 rms. so givin em about 335 isnt bad at all. there gonna be loud. sound good and impress your friends that bought alpine type e's and rockford p2's. it will be a good starter system. just remember that their is brands you can look into that arent mainstream. treo. fi. re audio.dd audio..there all excellent.anyone sorry for the long answer. but i just want you to get the most ''bang for your buck''. and dont buy wat someone else says. buy what you want|`|K6YSZES9aa	go for the L7.. it exactly matches ur amp. and L& are proven loud. you know that..
7HDWtqhOaa	On all those trucks you have mentioned I would go no more lift than 3 inch's, I know that sounds like only a little but you have to worry about driveline and front axle angles, vibration, wear, and driveline or cv axles braking or falling out, (if trucks are 4x4) But if you got the money then you can lift it as high as you want to whatever the law allows. To give you a good idea try www.fullthrottle.com I think that is the web site. They do the big lifts, 6" 8" 10" and 12"  Hope this helps|`|Ges0ZeDjaa	it honestly depends on what  type of style you like, if you like a big beafy look than i would say to get like a 6 inch lift.
AA11264416	well i have a 98 Silverado Z71, id' say if your looking for a truck just for mudding or something for the weekends then go for the older one, don't use a brand new truck for mudding, use the rest of the money for upgrades, plus the insurance won't be as much
ywPADGDNaa	Get the Z71 cause it has a stiffer suspension and an off road package on it. plus you will save money on aftermarket mods. plus I love those trucks I think they are the best looking Trucks. Make sure they have a locked rear end you want both tires to spin not just one. I used to mud all the time in my 1996 2500 Ram with detroit lockup and 6" lift. Nice trucks though, really all of them will do but to be honest the new 2500 look the best lifted. I work at a Chevy dealership and we make custom trucks to order and we always put a custom 2500 with 6" lift on the lot they look much better than the 1500 lifted.|`|AA11264416	well i have a 98 Silverado Z71, id' say if your looking for a truck just for mudding or something for the weekends then go for the older one, don't use a brand new truck for mudding, use the rest of the money for upgrades, plus the insurance won't be as much|`|d9ECb7N8aa	None on your list. Pick a truck that has a solid front axle (pre 88-91 depending on model). So get you an 88 or older truck. They are literally everywhere for a couple grand for a good one. They are cheap and easy to lift, and will handle larger tires better than the newer models.    The problem with your list is all the trucks have IFS. IFS doesn't do well with more than 6" lifts (which are harder to find and a lot of money), and the half-ton trucks can't really handle anything bigger than a 35" tire unless it is a trailer queen. Since your gonna be beating the piss out of it, the ball joints and the half-shafts are gonna leave you stranded!!!    One option is to get the '96 and swap a solid axle underneath it. It will cost you a few grand but it will handle a ton more abuse than the IFS could dream of.    And what in the world is an M8? And how in the hell did you come up with an '09 fullsize, an '09 compact, then a '96?!|`|wscyjkPAaa	If you're only gonna use it for mudding I'd pick the Chevy Z71 Silverado M8 and save your money for performance parts.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	79 or older 3/4 ton with Dana 60s front and rear with a 454  The truck in your list are 4x4 yes but wont last in mud without braking and costing some bit of change. The older ones are cheeper to fix, modifiy, and lift, price out a few lift kits on your truk list and it wont be a pretty sight   Good Luck|`|XH4O3ozFaa	Chevy K-5 Blazer is best and easiest to lift and mud in with being able to take half top off.  No new mods needed besides lift and tires and maybe cold air intake, free flow converter and Borla dual exhaust or get the one that is callled a snorkle and use single with 2.5 " pipe. Use Super Swamper 36" as more is waste and this brand is more knobby then rest.  also decant on street.  remember front guard below front end.  also a front bar with winch and 4-6 kaycees on chrome roll bar so no rust.  also diamond plate back if taking roof off as water will rust by getting into small ares.  Have a 78 Scrambler with 38" SS and 6" lift with 302 put in.  Will go over anything a Hummer will. remember that a mudder will cost money after built.  Bearings, idler arms and suspenion require constant attention when used mudding, not running through 3" of mud but crawling and mudding in swamps.  I went into 25Ft sinkhole and with 5 way belts got out easy and with SS floated up to tow out.  Sprayed with WD 40(plugs) and never ran better.|`|7a9hq9w8aa	My '80 Burb 4x4 is better in the mud than any pickup I've ever had. Drive one and try it out off road.|`|GbzQy1tyaa	2

nfynTFnTaa	I am figuring you mean street bike. If it has less than 7500 miles it is considered new and must meet california emission standards- the emission control label will either say it meet CA standard or CARB (CA Air Resource Board) standards. You will either need the registration card in your name or the title to the motorcycle. If you bought it, you will need the releasing signatures fo the owner(s) including any between you and the registered owner. Complete an application for title or registration- that will help to determine the fees that are due. They will need to look at your motorcycle too. The DMV will not ask for it when you register the motorcycle but will check later to make sure you have liability insurance.Oh, yeah, lastly money. They will take cash, check or debit cards.

AA11579694	All CDL drivers are required to get their CDL in the state in which they reside.  All states have a reciprocal agreements with each other which means that a CDL license issued in Texas is recognized in all other states.  However, if you plan to change your residence to take this new job offer in another state, you will be required to change your CDL to the state that you move to.

The chemicals seem to cause intake manifolds (plastic) to melt and/or gaskets to dissolve or break. You should try getting in touch with a GM representative. Arm yourself with a copy of the "GM lawsuit" materials available on the web, and hope for the best. The PCV valve has nothing to do with this issue. It is a design flaw and a compatibility problem. Almost all GM V6's are affected, and many GM 4cylinders. By rights, they should have informed you about this problem through the mail. If I were you, I would register a major complaint at the dealer and ask them why they didn't tell you about this issue. When the gasket begins to leak, coolant is drawn into the combustion chamber instead of staying in the cooling system where it belongs. The coolant level steadily drops and you lose power and MPG's. When the level drops enough, the cooling fan won't go on and WHAM!!!, you're over heating. Some cars require the installation of a brand new INTAKE MANIFOLD!!!! GM is not admitting fault on this matter. Do yourself a BIG favor! Insist on using a Fel-Pro gasket, have your entire cooling system flushed out, then have Mercedes Benz coolant (yellow) installed. This should prevent the recurrence of the problem, as there won't be a chemical reaction between the gaskets and the coolant chemicals. This should last for 100,000 miles!! It will protect the other parts of your cooling system best, as well!!!|`|gaXUIduMaa	Did you actually buy it or were you having your mechanic check it out?  Bet you won't make that mistake again.<br>  The coolant leak might go away if the you or the mechanic can tighten all the bolts but don't hold your breath. Do this on a cold engine for best results.  The PCV valve has nothing to do with cooling, it deals with emissions and it can affect performance.  The leaking coolant might if it is a significant leak or the fluids are left unchecked and are too low.  <br>  Is the car overheating all the time, only when traveling over x miles an hour, or when idling or traveling at a crawl?  If at an idle or crawl, it might be the water pump and the only way to find out is to remove it and inspect the pump "fins" inside the pump.  Few mechanics check this but badly worn fins will not move enough coolant through the engine during idling causing it to overheat.

Also make sure they show you a couple of their finished complete body paint jobs and if they show you older model cars with a real good paint job that helps to because the owners of those type of cars are real picky and if a paint job is screwed up on a 57 chevy that shop is not going to be in business for very long, you get cheap work and cheap paint at Macco and Earl Shibe
133b72a3abc7cc1f3d4de33c4a9209ceaa	Kendra,<br>     Im sorry you got stuck with a lemon.  It would help knowing what the countries are so I could speak to their specific laws.  You should research your country's lemon laws, however I think you have owned the car too long for any to apply.  Basically the hard truth is that you are stuck with the car.  The best thing you can do is fix the problems with the car, and sell it.  Its not that you will be passing on something wrong with the car to someone else since it is now fixed, but since you have had problems with the car in the past, it will be stuck in your mind that something will break.  <br>     <br>  One other recourse would be paying for a carfax.com report, but the car VIN number in and see the car's history.  Maybe you can find something there to prove that the person before you lied to you, perhaps about previous issues or number of owners.  However this will be tough to do and cost about 20 dollars.  I would stick with my first bit of advice and work from there.  Good luck.  -Joe|`|ebd6328ca22edc0d5cd5eaf98456cf2daa	My opinion is that u got the short end of the stick and its very hard to get any recourse from the seller cos it's buyer beware when buying stuff. Unless of course he tricked u into buying it and u can prove it then there's a way to recover your money.

If you have a Dana 35c rear axle you should also upgrade the shafts with a Super 35 kit, just do a google search.  All his is going to cost a pretty penny, super 35 will run you around $700, and re-gearing averages around $1000.

BGu7XEsfaa	There are quite a few choices available, and most meet the required safety standards.    If you check out stores near you, find out the models they have available and check for reviews on-line.    Try them on.   To me, this is an absolute necessity.    I have tried $500 helmets and $80 helmets....at both ends I have found helmets that I would not wear...because of the fit.    My first choice would be the one that best fits MY head, and that means you go to a bike shop and try on new helmets.     Too tight means you will be uncomfortable, too loose means it can shift  around when you need it most, and that motion may actually cause injury to your head or neck.    A simple rule is: if it does not fit YOU very well, it is not a good deal and it is not a safe helmet, no matter the price.      .|`|GsqQ4UTnaa	Icon Alliance SSR...

That is usually more than generous, but most people will not pay you anything above that amount.  Haggle with them, and if you think your getting a bad deal then just tell them that you'll think about it and if you don't get any better offers you sell it to them for that price.

4d1ed0b771143afc8f21cd1ebe05d5c4aa	MG-Rover as a company sold cars under two brands, MG and Rover.<br>  Autotrader lists cars by brand, not by manufacturing company.<br>  In the same way it lists Alfa-Romeo, Fiat, Maserati and Ferrari separately, even though they are all brands of the Fiat group.<br>  <br>  MG-Rover was placed in receivership in 2005.<br>  It had already been in partnership with a Chinese company SAIC, and had transferred all the rights to the Rover 25 and 75 products to SAIC. However it still held the rights to the MG products and the MG brand. The Rover Brand was owned at the time by BMW, and MG-Rover were using it under licence.<br>  Most of the rights to the 45 belonged to Honda, as it was a derivative of a previous generation Honda Civic.<br>  <br>  Another Chinese company, NAC, bought most of the assets of MG-Rover, including the facilities at Longbridge, the production equipment, and the rights to the MG models.<br>  <br>  NAC transferred the production equipment for the Rover 75 / MG ZT and the MGTF to China, and started production the MG ZT, now called MG 7, in China in 2007. They have also introduced the MG3 (formerly the MG ZR) and MG3 SW (formerly the Rover Streetwise) in China.<br>  <br>  SAIC invented the "Roewe" brand for their Rover-based cars, and started production of a slightly modified Rover 75, called the Roewe 750, also in China in 2007. The have more recently introduced the Roewe 550, based on MG-Rover's never completed RD/X-60 programme.<br>  <br>  Later NAC and SAIC merged, so that the rights to all the Roewe and MG models are now with one company. Production of the MGTF has now restarted in Longbridge, using parts imported from China.<br>  Just this week pictures have appeared on the internet of a new MG6 model, based on the Roewe 550, while a hatchback version, the MG5, is also thought to be close to production. The Roewe 550 is already sold as the MG6 in some south American countries, but the styling is identical to the Chinese-market 550 and does not have the MG brand's styling cues.<br>  <br>  Therefore you can now buy a new MGTF in the UK, a new MG3, MG3 SW or MG7 in China, or a new MG6 in South America.<br>  <br>  The rest of the Roewe / MG range should come to the UK market within a couple of years.|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Yep, it's true, as a car nut, I can tell u that MG-Rover is dead as the common sense of liberals, now the Rover brand is owned by a chinaese  group, and they will call it Rowe and it will be a crappy chinaese car.

A bad coil would only affect those two combinations.<br>  The vacuum carbs are a major problem on older bikes. They work by balancing a metal spring against air pressure. The slightest buildup of varnish or air leak will upset the balance. You would literally need an x-ray microscope to inspect all the internal passageways.<br>  Try to find another set of carbs.<br>  <br>  BTW Janice doesn't know anything.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	I agree, you need to run a compression test on the bike.  Since you state the coil for those cylinders is firing, the problem does not seem to be "only fifering-firing?-on 2 cylinders".  When the plugs have spark-that is "firing".  What you may have is low compression on 1 or more cylinders or  carb problems on 1 or more cylinders.<br>  <br>  Just for fun-what color was the spark at the plug on each of those plugs-you should see a fat blue spark jump across the plug.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	Basically torque steer is caused in front wheel drive vehicles due to one axle being shorter than the other side axle, most front drivers have this problem if the engine is pretty torquey.|`|FsT54qh1aa	The drive wheels....in a front wheel drive vehicle transmit power through the front wheels. Your steering linkage is also connected to the front wheels. So under very heavy acceleration on a front wheel drive vehicle.....the violence of the power transmission messes with the feel and pull of the steering. Hence torque steer.<br>      This isn't a problem on rwd vehicles for obvious reasons.|`|2Rp9xLRHaa	Usually torque steer is a result of loose steering componants. When you hit the accellerator hard the torque of the motor will pull the car to the right, and when you let off, the car will swerve left. Ball joints and tie rod/drag link ends are the most likely items. This is assuming you have a stock or lightly modified engine. Torque steer in drag cars comes from the twisting of the frame when you get on it, and requires frame modifications to correct.|`|NPfmdsg8aa	The other answers are close but here's what causes torque steer. Many transaxles have the differential mounted off-center so the result is unequal-length drive shafts, a problem that results from this is that the vehicle will pull to one side during acceleration, torque steer is caused by the length of the shafts and the tendency for the longer drive shaft to twist, the vehicle turns toward the side that has the longer drive shaft.|`|DBcy7Jk3aa	mostly on a front wheel drive when you floor the throttle since the front does most everything like drive the car, most the brakeing and steering. when the power kicks in the just pulls the car unlike rear wheel drive where you push the car and let the front steer and have  a better balance to the car with the shaft down the middle and differential at the back. like fwd all the weight as at the front.|`|bvCkplELaa	You cant eliminate torque steer, all vehicles have it to some degree. Possible causes are worn motor or transmission mounts, incorrect caster, bad rack bushings etc.....wasted control arm bushing, oil leaks causing bushings to deteriorate

AA12258904	You don't mention if it's a front drive axle or the rear axle assembly. If it's a front drive axle, it should be OK, just make sure the splined outer end of the axle is the same length as the old one (especially if it's a rebuilt axle!!) and be sure to torque the axle nut to 185 ft/lbs. before putting any weight on the wheel.

dyIyJqauaa	If you are paying for a "write off" then you are essentially buying the car.  It will be yours....... But...... Make sure you are provided a clear title to the vehicle when you pay for it.  Tip:  You could also offer to sell it back to the owner so you don't have to sell it on your own.  To do that you need to see what the salvage value might be|`|uMKuOlFNaa	You keep talking about "negotiations" What exactly do you mean?  Is in any way the owner of the vehicle is not being paid FULL VALUE of the vehicle, being you keep talking about "negotiations"  If the ins. company is taking up your slack (paying the owner the difference of the vehicles value) They will want to vehicle for the salvage value. They will auction it off to re-coop some of their loss you have caused by "conveniently forgetting" to pay your liability insurance.|`|b57Q4LIzaa	Because you are negotiating the settlement with the other party, it is up to you to determine the terms.  There is no law that forces the other party to sign their auto over to you should you offer a "write-off", so it is up to them to make that determination, and you to accept or make counter-offer.    In the case when an insurance company determines that an automobile is a "total loss", they offer the insured a payment in exchange for their automobile.  These are the terms set by the company at the time the policy is purchased, and the insured accepts these terms by buying the policy.    You, however, did not agree to any terms with the other party before getting into an accident.  Therefore, there are no strict rules to the settlement you make with them.    Before you complete your settlement with the other party, be sure to have a contract at the ready that states the other party's claim is completely satisfied by your settlement. You may want to have this contract drawn up by a lawyer, or find a boilerplate from Nolo Press.  Otherwise, you may still be liable for damages in a court of law, despite the fact that you made a payment to the other party.

8fc7d5f02185d5658867493b89ae2663aa	The AC system is always under pressure with the engine running or not. Not turning the AC off will not affect the compressor valves as you put it but as previously said the clutch for the AC is electronically controlled and on older model cars when you come to start your car if you have left the AC switched on it might try to engage the AC clutch while cranking the car. So it is always best to switch off the AC before switching off the engine.|`|k55p1pKraa	That's every much true , but most people are in to big of a hurry to take the time to turn it off & on so they just leave them on , but anytime you run something that as pressure left on it will end up blowning a seal , gasket or something just from having to hold the pressure when it doesn't need to be.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	easier on car when it come time to restart wil have less drag on motor an d yes should shut it off|`|0qGwCA1Baa	i think that is false but what would it hurt to turn it off when you get to were your going..|`|gnonlDpiaa	The compressor is just a belt driven pump. The only thing flipping the a/c switch does is engage an electric clutch to drive the compressor. Its a basic elecromagnet clutch. It releases on its own as soon as you shut off the car.

2fcd2607bd7be2c61daddfb8bf68fbf5aa	this was brought up in last months car and driver so ill try to give you a basic idea.     a small engine is connected to a hydraulic pump in stead of the transmission and instead of powering the car, it pressurizes hydraulic fluid which is stored in a huge accumulator. (imagine a long scuba tank made of carbon fiber) inside the accumulator is a bladder filled with nitrogen and as its compressed by the hydraulic fluid, energy is stored. the pressure is then routed to hydraulic motors that are connected to the drive shaft or wheels.     the system in the car and driver magazine was about ups trucks. because they make frequent stops this system would be good for them, seeing as just like in hyrbid cars, breaking energy is stored. tho in this case back into the accumulator.     according to the article these trucks get 45-50 percent better fuel mileage.|`|0qGwCA1Baa	is a machine that produces motion by means of pressure from water or some other fluid.

JJsJaQjxaa	You might not believe this but years back when I was in the Big Brother/Big Sister program me and a young kid that had a YZ80 would go out and ride every weekend. He started hitting that growth spurt that all kids around that age get and was looking to get a bigger bike. He asked if he could take a ride on my KX250. Since we were on level ground and he could touch the dirt with his boots (barely) I decided to let him try. He took off on the thing! He was a little leery though about woods riding with it because if he had to stab the ground quickly he wasn't quite tall enough. This kid was only 12 going on 13, so yeah, I'd say you're good.|`|u0PHhZOSaa	try one if you like it get one if not then get a four stroke. you have experience  with bikes si i think you need to try one your self and see. good luck|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	So you're about 5'6" - 5'7" if I did my math right.

b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	There are specialised polishes that stain the scratches and make them much less noticeable the polish is called colour fast , you can buy it at any local car spares shop.You select the colour of the polish to the colour of you car .|`|0qGwCA1Baa	you could try to buff the crap out of it with a buffer and some wax ask your local auto parts store,but you might need a new paint job|`|AA12160610	If you know how to use a buffer 3M makes a polish called Finesse It. You need to buy a foam pad that goes with the polish. It is designed to remove swirl marks out of the finish of your paint. Read the directions and follow them closely. When you first start wet the foam pad down and ring out the water it helps with the heat build up from the foam pad. Use a small amount just bigger than a quarter. Buff an area 12X12 and work your way around the car. After you get done wash the car and go over the car with the polish like you would with a wax. It helps with the shine and takes out the smudges.

If your mom leases the car, remember she would be 100% responsible for it. The car has to have full coverage insurance. The car cannot be modified in any way. The car has to be returned in good condition. Any scratches or damage will have to be paid for. There is a mileage limit, which if exceeded you have to pay for the extra miles, the car has to be serviced regularly as per the service manual.|`|AA11754206	being under the legal age of 17 means you cannot enter into any contract for items of which their nature is not a requirement to live, i.e shelter is a requirement so you can legally enter contract to buy a home, but since a car is not a requirement to survive you can't. also don't lease a car its a horrible move unless you own your own business, because if its for a business you can get more tax right offs, you would be much better off finding a car to buy that way you don't pay for something just so you can give it back.|`|MkCGveKGaa	It isn't likely unless you and your twin have someone to with good credit cosign with you.

Yes, the payments are low but leases are expensive to end early -- and teenagers get tired of cars quickly, and want new ones. However, if you think it's really what you want to do, you need to understand how it works because it's more complicated than buying. Here's an article that might help:    http://www.leaseguide.com/lease01.htm    .|`|YuYSL0A2aa	You can not buy or lease a car until you are 18, I would recommend that you see about having you mom as a co-signer on the lease so you could help build your credit. I'm not sure if they would allow 3 people on the lease. As for the other you need to pay your bill's no matter the amount on time so you don't risk damaging your credit.  Do you have your own bank account? If so a lot of banks offer free online bill pay and you can set it up to pay anyone so you don't have to travel.

The Golf is a fairly heavy car and I'd regard the 1.6 as the minimum engine you'd want in it. Also bear in mind that in any car of that age, how reliable it's going to be has far less to do with what type/engine/model it is, and everything to do with how well it's been looked after over the years.|`|907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	even if the engine was very reliable, as fatrab said, its underpowered for the size of car.    i wouldnt touch an sdi diesel either.  they are non turbo diesels, and are painfully slow.

When you see the lights on some cars it might be whats called the Daylight Running Lights.  Some imports, and GM cars and trucks use this system.  It is to improve safety and allow other cars to see you better in daylight conditions.  In Canada it is a requirement, in the US it is not required.

addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	He is right.    But, turbo's usually last 60,000 miles anyways. And Subaru's are very reliable cars.    To take care of a turbo, wait 45 seconds before turning the car off to let the turbo cool down.  Use Premium gas only. That is required.  Used the recommended oil for the car.    Turbo's cost anywhere from $1000-2000 to replace.  Or $200-400 to rebuild/refurbish.|`|UcXaXtrpaa	Myself buy turbo imports all the time and the best bet is to buy the car from an enthusiast and not someone whom just wanted the car to muck around it,source out someone whom may have done mods thats the norm but decent mods and has looked after the car they don't have to be old but ,myself will mail and chat with them and you get a good idea of the person other idea is get on the subaru forums and find one for sale on there as 99% of owners will not sell a bad car on there do to the hassle they would get from other enthusiast also looking at the sellers past forum post gives you an idea of the troubles if any they have had on there cars,and how they fixed it.

Even better than my 03 WRX.  With the current economy, I would wait a bit.  The deals will only get better.  Subaru is one of the few car companies that did not suffer as Toyota, GM, Ford, Dodge.....      You own a Subaru so you know how reliable they are.  Consumer Reports rated Honda, Toyota and Subaru as the most reliable cars by FAR.  On the other hand, buying a used sports car is iffy.    Take a good look at the paint and interior.  It will give you a good idea on how the previous owner took care of the vehicle.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Subaru makes one of the most reliable engines out there and as far as the turbo being beat on, I wouldn't worry about that either.  The VF series turbo's are very strong and since they are liquid cooled after the car is stopped, they last a very long time.  If you do some research on Subaru forums, there are very few OEM turbo failures from over use.  The main thing to worry about is weather it has been maintained properly so make sure you see proof of all the work.  And they are so easy to work on so don't be discouraged by someone who did the maintenance them self as long as they have proof.  Another thing is to get some insurance quotes before buying.  If you haven't done so and you are still young,  you may be shocked at how high it is.|`|PNukZg6raa	Just find one with low miles see how many owners it has had and how old or mature the seller is.|`|7vIfwtvFaa	it is no more a bad idea than buying any other second hand car, if it has had regular servicing then it is fine. the only problem you will have is that it is a 4WD and it will consume more fuel hence it will cost more, plus it is a turbo so it will have to have more regular servicing like every 5k, just to be safe. also just get a prepurchase inspection done it will only cost a few hundred dollars and it could tell you if there are any major problems.|`|d13b96c180e9e64a5d7f4be883e97f9baa	I thought I read in CD that teh new WRX is faster to 60 then the old STi's(since they increased the HP of the '09).

EGew3Ltuaa	Honda Fit, Toyota Corolla, Chevrolet Malibu. The Fit's a subcompact, so that's probably too small. The Corolla's a small car, but not too small, and is definitely under $20,000. It gets the best fuel economy of any car that isn't a hybrid or a diesel (it's pretty much tied with the Fit).

Just make sure the engine the dealer shows you is the ORIGINAL Honda, try getting the V-TEC, they are the best.

9EdJHqKHaa	First, be sure the intersection where you are u-turning is legal. Next, yes, you must always yield when making any u-turn. On-coming traffic does not need to yield to you. If you are at an intersection where a u-turn is legal and there is a traffic light and you get a green ARROW to make a left, then you can proceed the same as if you were making a left hand turn. You probably dont see them yielding to cars making a right because those cars are not going to be traveling the same path as them, because they are turning off to the right. When in doubt, yield.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	in  las vegas and yes  yield to on coming cars or you get hit by on coming cars and its legal unless posted not any where in las vegas and it dont have to be at a light you can pretty much make a u turn any where that its not mark no u turns and few do it anyways|`|ENJ0bY48aa	U turns are illegal in most cities.  Always be a defensive driver.  Assume the car is going to pull out in your way or isn't going to stop and be prepared for it.|`|hwbBfyBPaa	why would you make a Uturn to the right?? when making a Uturn you just yeild to on coming cars, unless you have the right of way, such as a green arrow or your turn at a stop sign.|`|i1IJ2RNNaa	I think it depends if the conflicting right turns are being made in front of you from the opposing direction, or from the side street approaches.    I think U-turns are kind of low on the totem pole in terms of rights and some motorists may not be expecting them.    Like vehicles making a LT, U-turning vehicles should yield to opposing through traffic and opposing right turns unless there is a dedicated LT arrow.     However U-turning vehicles on a major roadway should not have to yield to those motorists who make rolling stop right turns from a minor approach. If you are making a legal U turn and you enter the intersection if a right turning motorist assumes that you are making a left turn, and cuts in front of you, they are incorrectly entering an occupied intersection.  At locations where there is a high volume of U-turns, traffic engineers will often place a "no right turn on red" sign up or install a red arrow to prevent such conflicts.      I always thought that automobiles should be a special signal for U-turns, like a mid bumper middle blinker. U-turns are somewhat odd because you never know when a left turn will turn into a U turn.

YZhD94WEaa	Sounds like your rotors need to be resurfaced. The rotors is what the break pads grip onto in order to slow then stop the vehicle. If your break pads were completely gone before you changed for new ones theres a good chance your rotors are warped.     The idiots that changed your breaks were supposed to check this for you before putting new brakes on there, without re surfacing the rotors all you are doing is killing the pads they just put on there. I would, if I was you, go back to where it was fixed and complain about the sqeaking and what not aswell, you walked in there becuase your breaks were squeaking and you knew the pads needed changing and left with new squealing break pads. The squeaking is something I always deal with becuase i normally just change them myself, but you paid someone to do a job and they did not do it right, complain.|`|bzfXbM4raa	When you change your pads, you're suppose to change, or at last clean your rotors as well...was that done?|`|c82ecbef231aced5c49891502424aad3aa	You know the companies that make brake pads put metal in the pads so they last longer.

0bHxrymKaa	King cobras are good, but centerforce is a much better one.|`|uLEpOpSMaa	I had a 1990 Mustang GT with an aftermarket performance clutch, and there's a good chance it was a King Cobra.  It's a great racing clutch but just to warn you, it isn't the most forgiving one and is very grabby.  So in other words, smooth shifts are kind of hard if you're used to more passive clutches and it is fairly easy to stall.  This was my daily driver and I eventually could drive it as smooth as butter, but everyone else who drove it shifted awkwardly and stalled all the time.|`|SLcZatQBaa	Choose your parts depending on how you drive your car or what you will be adding to the car in the future.  If it's going to stay stock then just stick with a stock replacement from a parts store.  The idea of a Centerforce in a daily stock driver is rediculous and overkill.|`|AA10613104	I recently replaced my clutch on a fairly stock 94 5.0.  I chose not the king cobra clutch, but the 10.5 in Ford Racing clutch kit from summit, which came with a new throwout bearing as well.  It has like 50 percent gripping force over stock, but its more driveable and has longer life than the king cobra supposedly.  It was a $200 part about.  I love the clutch, plenty of grip, nice hard feel, no shuttering or anything after break-in.  This clutch is basically an on-off switch(old timers may call it a "suicide clutch"), with very little travel, took some getting used to but is nice and snappy when you get the feel.  I am totally happy with it, would buy one again, exceeds my needs on my lightly modded 5.0.  I dont see a need for a king cobra on a stock platform. hope this helps.

It's about the same on a motorcycle, except at a higher speed.  Hopefully while you're learning you'll go slow enough that you won't get killed, but it's likely that you will have a spill or two before you get the hang of it.    At the very least you need a helmet, gloves and a good jacket.    I would recommend a full face helmet unless you absolutely get claustrophobia or something.  There are articles in motorcycle magazines every so often that test all kinds of helmets and find that the cheap ones work just as well as the expensive ones, you're paying for light weight and other features.  These articles also sometimes have a diagram of what percentage of impacts are where on the helmet, and almost half are on the front of the helmet, so that's why a full face is good.    When you fall, you reflexively put your hands out to stop yourself. Thats why gloves are important.  They should have good leather palms, maybe with extra padding on the 'heel' of the  hand.  If you fall on them, you're probably going to slide on them, on the street, maybe 10 feet.  They should fit comfortably with your hands curled around the grips.    And usually you fall on your arm and shoulder, so you want a jacket that protects these parts.  Leather used to be considered mandatory, partly for abrasion resistance but also partly because it doesn't flap in the wind. But there are fabrics now that work just as well and are cooler in Summer.    If you had the money and wanted to go whole hog, leather pants and boots might be nice.  But I don't find them as indispensable as helmet, gloves and jacket.    Good clothes are not just safer, they are more comfortable.  If you ride a lot, you develop a 'wardrobe' for different temperatures, different conditions, etc.  I have a helmet, a leather jacket, a mesh jacket for Summer, a sweater to go under the leather jacket, heavy Winter gloves and light mesh Summer gloves.  These all fit in my saddlebags so when I go off for a weekend ride I'm ready for anything. But I have it easy, living in California, it seldom goes below 40 and I don't ride in the rain unless I get caught in it, which is maybe once every other year.    Unfortunately the best deals are mail order, but it's nice to have a M/C accessories shop to try things on.  I certainly wouldn't buy gloves without trying them on.  If you want to save money, check out www. newenough.com  I've bought a lot of things there and they are very nice.    Good luck!|`|WFxVuM1Laa	Leathers, helps against the cold and helps prevent roadrash!! cyclegear.com  is a good place to look.|`|38IZfJqiaa	I would also consider buying a used bike, in which the previous owner is throwing in some gear to go with the bike. My first bike the previous owner threw in a helmet and jacket. But I would at the very least always wear a helmet and jeans and boots. They don't have to be the expensive motorcycle boots, but some good leather boots, Timberwolves whatever but something that will protect your feet and ankle. Most motorcycle jackets have pads in the forearms and back to help you in the event of a wreck. Hope this helps! PS your first bike should be 600cc or less.|`|Pvf1HcJmaa	A lot of these answer's are very good, and if you have the money to go out and buy all the leather's that's great! I on the other hand can't afford the expensive leathers so what I recommend is this. A basic rule I ALWAYS follow on my bike is Jeans, never shorts, I burned a "K" into my leg from a Kawasaki, it was there for almost a year, don't wear sandals, I can't stand watching these guys on there crotch rockets wearing shorts and sandals, there just asking to lose toes. Eye protection, sunglasses, safety glasses are all cheap at local gas stations, or Lowes, and I prefer Helmets that don't cover my ears so I get a good sense of what's happening around me.

154146d98d9dbb211223b05af3f8c0d5aa	It depends on your purpose.  If you are drag racing, the shift points would be at the the RPM at which the torque of the engine at the lower RPM multiplied by the gear ratio in the next gear is equal or greater than the torque of the engine at the higher RPM times the gear ratio of the lower gear.  For my GT it was 6500, 6400, 6300. There never was a 4-5 shift because the torque in fifth was never higher than what was available in fourth. For this reason, the top speed was the same in fourth or fifth.  The shift point is not at the horsepower peak but actually a little beyond it, keeping the output closest to the peak on average.  For ordinary driving, 2100 is a good shift point, the engine makes plenty of torque for comfortable diving without jerking|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	just listen to it  really first 15 to 20 second 20 to 30 third 30 to 40 fifth 40 up or slower do  it mostly my ear and feeling you shoul dhear you motor reaching its limits and pushing that limit only shorten the life of motor|`|iu3Bem6paa	you must be a first time manual transmission driver.  there is no suggested rpm to shift in any vehicle.  shift earlier to attain better fuel economy, higher for more power and speed.|`|DS1YbZOraa	Get an auto dumb ***.|`|AA10613104	2100 is a great number as said before, for gas mileage you can do it at 1800.

de14HtA9aa	I had the same problem with my boss's car a 98 VW Golf.  It seems your wearing out the clutch and it will only get worse with time.  You need to get it changed as soon as you can.  My clutch got so bad that it wouldn't let me change gears while driving up or down I'd have to wait a bit and pull of to the side of the road for it to work again which was weird cause after it would work a lil and than the gears would lock up again and I'd have to repeat the whole process all over again.  For awhile my boss didn't believe me cause it never happend when he drove the car but eventually it finally started getting to the point where I got broke down and needed him to have his car towed to the garage.  He didn't want to waste the extra money so he decided to drive it there himself.

SuZbBnycaa	I don't know what a NOC is, but here in California once a car loan has been paid off, the lender will sign and stamp the title as being paid in full and mail it to you.    Sometimes the lender will do the title work for you and send it to DMV who then issues a new title with just your name on it, and no lenders name.    Sometimes the lender just sends you the title with their name still on it and you take it to the DMV to get the ball rolling in getting you a new title with only your name on it.    It costs $15 to remove the lenders name.  congratulations!

N4IGdJXwaa	Bad Wheel Bearings Usually make a grinding noise.  If you jack the car up, and you can shake (jiggle) the wheel back and fourth, that would also be a indicator of a bad wheel bearing. Sometimes you may only get one symptom.  You should purchase new wheel bearings.

UjhWIrJ1aa	Make sure the new tires you get have the same rolling diameter as what is currently on the vehicle. Larger rims don't always mean a screwed up speedometer. You won't find an exact match, but you should be able to get something pretty close, so you'll probably be 1 or 2 mph off, but not enough to really cause any harm. You'll have smaller sidewalls, so you shouldn't really worry much about suspension yet. Go outside, and measure from the bottom of the tire, to the very top of the tire. Your new setup can't be any larger than that.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	First thing you have to do is have the speedo drive changed or you will be travelling much faster than the speedo registers.|`|xJukjCWiaa	Well a couple things you should know...    1. Putting larger wheels and tires means that your spedo will no longer be reading the correct time, and you will have to modify the computer to read the correct speed.    2. If you go too large, the turning radius of the car will be affected, and if you go way to large, the wheels may actually hit the car.    3. Due to the increase in rolling resistance, putting larger wheels on your car will slow it down and affect gas mileage unless you plan on getting ultralight rims    as far as suspension mods go, this is probably because the car needs to be higher so the wheels wont hit the car.

You have to be 18 to own a car or have insurance on one.  It has to be in parents name until loan is paid or if cash when you are 18. girls have higher insurance until 25.  VW is 20-28000 and BMW is 45000 or more.  If loan parents pay 6-650 for VW and 8-900 a month for BMW. Insurance will be 1-200 a month pklus maintenance and repairs.  That is giving your parents another mortage payment.  If you say that you will work and when out of school take over payments will you afford 1000 a month? plus insurance?|`|pPVIFX3Zaa	bmw's are nice, and so are jettas, I can see why your undecided!!! take gas mileage into consideration!!!

VbV5MsICaa	hm. well subwoofers basicaly reproduce low frecuency sound. so lets say anything under 100 hz. subs consist of a few things. a magnet. a voicecoil a cone. a basket.and suspension. when your listening to music. you have three speakers generaly. a tweater wich reproduces high pitch noises.1000 hz to 20000 hz wich is the highest pitch noise you can hear. these speakers hurt your ears.then you have midbass speakers.they play like.well middle noises 100 hz to 999hz or so. and subs make the low notes. basicaly when an electric current is sent thru the voicecoil it is pushed or pulled away from the magnet. creating soundwaves.the human ear picks it up as a deep noise. anyway im not sure if thats what you were lookin for or if it was any help. and i dont wanna get hated on for my answer and corrected.but thats just a basic outline on what a subwoofer is.get one!|`|VR0h4L32aa	i dont now jibbs or whatever is.  but a subwoofer only produces the bass sound, it makes the bass sound louder, music doesnt sound rite without bass so there are subwoofers

KNOCK NEVIS is so huge that when fully laden she cannot pass through the 32 mile wide English channel because it cannot manoeuvre, as travelling in a straight line is its best forte.     Fully laden, she sits 24.5 meters deep in the sea, a depth great enough to stop her from accessing most of the worlds major ports.     The cargo of oil she normally carries is worth $122 million - separated from the sea by just 3.5cm of steel plate!     The holds could swallow St Pauls Cathedral four times over. It has a crew of 35 to 40, which means it only needs two lifeboats.

The SSC Aero has 1183 hp which is also higher than the Veyron's 1001.  SSC is trying to make an electric engine for the Aero that will give it the same performance.  Other cars that are faster than 240 are the Koenigsegg CCX and the McLaren F1.  Other fast cars, like the Corvette, only go about 190 mph.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	It depends on the circumstances at the time. There are no hard and fast rules, just "guidance"    For example, there is the case of a first-time offender who drove at 29mph in a 20mph zone and was banned for the offence. Why? Because the 20mph limit was near a school, even though the children were in their classrooms at the time!    It's called "zero-tolerance".|`|eg71zQ5Raa	Any speed over the posted limit could potentially get you a ban - it would depend on the circumstances.  However, anything over 100 on a motorway will get you banned (barring a good lawyer or extenuating circumstances)    ACPO guidelines are that you would be summonsed to court at the following speeds    Limit             summons  20                 35+  30                 50+  40                 66+  50                 76+  60                 86+  70                 96+    Anything under those would be a fixed penalty (again upto the copper on the scene at the time)|`|1lsvWj6zaa	30mph above any of the speed limits and you will get a ban|`|1545062c5c87be5a56f1f287fcc4e2c2aa	If your caught driVing at 100mph you get an automatic ban (UK)|`|x0flaLfUaa	It all depends on whether you are caught or not.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	It also depends on the cop who stops you and the road conditions at the time.

Not normally as long as a ban for drink driving,often a couple of months, but over a ton, and you're in trouble.

Get caught 4 times and theres your ban.     Normally police allow you 10% ie. 33 in a 30 limit or 55 in a 50 limit and so on, go slightly over this and face 3 points and a 60 fine. Go over it by a serious amount, ie 39 in a 30, 66 in a 50 etc, you face a court appearance, 6 points and a hefty fine. As stated above by awphotog, this will be at the discretion of the police officer in attendance!!!!    Now for the serious stuff, more than 20mph over any limit will be frowned upon by the courts - expect a 3 month ban, anything less than this is a bonus!    And as for the illusive 100mph figure everyone is throwing around, yes some forces around the uk have a "go over 100mph - automatic ban" policy but it is regional (you'll more than likely be banned, it just won't be an "automatic" process, you'll need to go to court).    Some forces offer speed awareness courses for minor speeding violations, and high speed courses for more serious offenders, which offer an alternative to points or a reduced penalty (ie you do the high speed course and get 3 points instead of a court appearance)    hope this helps answer your question

ae151ebdc335662b7002da215ee08b6baa	For the hazard perception test you need to click when you see the hazard and click again when the hazard is gone. This could mean you click when i child is show on the screen playing on the street and then clicking when you have passed them, or before and after a car pulls out or something.

qyqxp4abaa	Yes, in fact you may already be using it.  Many commercial blends use 10% ethanol, and gas line antifreeze is typically isopropyl or other alcohols.  However, unless your vehicle is specifically equipped for it, keep the percentage low relative to gasoline.  Many fuel system components are susceptible to corrosion from most alcohols.     Of course, there are vehicles designed to run on E85 and we'll likely be seeing more as genetically engineered crops designed to be converted to ethanol are further developed.  The current corn to ethanol fiasco is a setback, but I believe that eventually we'll be using much more alcohol as fuel.  It can burn cleaner than gas, albeit with a lower energy content, requiring more fuel to generate the same amount of power.|`|YMcpYvp2aa	yes it can but for most engines must not ba added over 10% and it must be agitated and must be used straight away as it will seperate back into separate parts which will kill an engine if put into the combustion chamber
c48nm70gaa	In a diesel or gasoline application, fuel is atomized into tiny droplets by the fuel injector nozzles under pressure. The finer the droplets, incoming air through the throttle body in gasoline engines or turbocharger in diesel engines further prepares the mixture for burning in the combustion chambers.     Some gasoline engines inject the droplets behind the intake valves and when they open (intake valves the air /fuel mixture is sucked under vacuum into the cylinder. Other gasoline engines inject gasoline directly into the cylinder when the piston is on the compression stroke much like a diesel.    It's important to note that finer droplets of fuel mixed with air creates a more explosive complete combustion situation when the air/fuel is ignited during the power stroke of the piston, connecting rod and crankshaft.     This is one of the reasons cars and trucks are able to get better fuel economy then they did 50 years ago.     Some cars and trucks have two intake valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder head so that the flow of the air/fuel mixture can be less obstructed in and out of the combustion chamber. In some cases the camshaft (s) actually advance and retard according to the RPM range to gain maximum torque and horsepower.|`|HUluAQM3aa	Incoming fuel in to the intake manifold must pass over the intake valve stems on it's way to the combustion chamber.  The incoming fuel also helps cool the intake valves.|`|FKXG3IPiaa	It runs the car , the fuel gets burnt and the presurre created is used to move the pistons whcih in turn moves the tyres.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	If you put a small amount of high energy fuel such as gasoline in an enclosed space and ignite it, a large amount of energy is released in the form of expanding gas.   In an internal combustion engine, the type of engine used in the majority of motor vehicles today, the fuel is fed into a combustion chamber, ignited by the spark plug, and the resulting expanding gases push the pistons which turn the crankshaft which in turn drives the wheels.   In steam engines, high pressure steam is used to drive the pistons. In the case of those, solid fuel such as coal is used to heat water to convert it to steam.  The internal combustion engine process is better demonstrated in the diagram at the link below.|`|uMKuOlFNaa	The fuel pours into the combustion chamber (pistons live in there too) When the piston "hits top dead center" the fuel ignites (when it touches the spark plugs) creating compression etc. That is how your motor runs.|`|apoNgAmKaa	It is the most essential fluid of the car. How can you imagine a car without fuel. It is required to run the car. It is the fuel that offers kinetic energy to the car.|`|SxXIUBERaa	In an internal combustion engine, fuel provides the power.  It is mixed with air and ignited under pressure.  I causes pistons to move up and down which turns a crank shaft.  This process turns heat energy into up and down mechanical energy, and then into circulating mechanical energy that spins your tires (or your propeller).|`|PzXUsvPHaa	engine is a mechanical device,which convert one form of energy into other form,i.e.chemical enrgy in to mechanical enrgy  fuel like petrol,deisel,etc have chemical energy which is required for a engine|`|eVCzjfHyaa	in earlier period train used by steam engine because some materials are burn and vibrated and it have kinetic  energy so the trains are move easily.  in the modern period fuel is used  it will burn with in seconds and move very easily|`|rK3HOUEraa	hey! thats a good question,a fuel lets the car runs|`|Ty32khkaaa	Internal combustion gasoline engines run on a mixture of gasoline and air.  The ideal mixture is 14.7 parts of  air to one part of gasoline (by weight.)  Since gas weighs much more than air, we are talking about a whole lot of air and a tiny bit of gas.   One part of gas that is completely vaporized into 14.7 parts of air can produce tremendous power when ignited inside an engine.

d737ea63327b6a7be9b660b3cc16cd04aa	Hi there, right it can be done but i suggest caution. get your self a 12volt tester to check positive wiring there will be two feeds one battery feed and one ignition feed. once you have isolated these two wires then things will be a bit simpler.next is to identify the earth wire and this is usually a thicker wire, it will either be black, white or brown. your Speaker wires wil be grouped together, and be thin wires, the only problem is finding the right speaker wire to join to your jvc. what i usually do is to cut  the speaker wires in the xsara individually before you remove old unit if it is a four speaker system just take note which speaker stops working when cut just twist the two wires together with tape so it will be easier to fit to new unit. just take you time but please ensure you isolate positive wires or you will damage Your jvc.and as you know where the positive wires go in new unit it should be fine.  Jock|`|QV6swGUMaa	you could do more damage than good if you are not careful.sort the speaker wires out first and then look for the ower wire colour is red usually but can be different.the connector kit is about 20 poundhttp://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/store...|`|X16keVc1aa	Do not cut the wires.
