My peeps and I are wondering what the date is on the new Pancho's opening in Metairie,LA (a New Orleans suburb).       I know where it is located. I also understand that they are planning to open around the end of this month, but we have plans to make. So, if anyone knows an exact date, please share.      Also, if you don't care for Panchos, or blah, blah, blah obviously this isn't the question for you to be trying to answer. Only those we are equally curious, excited and in the know answer please.      Thanks! And have a great day!

20090309132530AAQN12P	Dining Out;United Kingdom;London	Turning 13 And Have A BAD Problem... 10 Points Best Answer...?	Okay So Here Is The Problem:   My 13th birthday is in 5 days. For my birthday me and my friends have decided to go somewhere (like ice-skating or bowling etc.) and then we are planning to go somewhere to eat. The only problem is: A) I don't get alot of pocket money and I have to pay for the food and B) I don't know where to go to and where to go to eat! My Grandma won't lend me money, nor will my dad and I don't live with my mum. Also about 10 people are coming to the party and I don't know what to do for food! It's so stressful and no one is really helping!    Sorry it's so long.    Thanks! xoxox =)
