20090223051821AAr5Hvs	Local Businesses;Singapore	How can I improve and reduce the words in this essay? (Needs reading, please????)?	It needs to be only 250 words.    a. Which line should I remove from the essay?      I think it needs a little bit of polishing.   b. Where should I change?   c. To what should I change it?      "_needed_"   d. What is the most suitable word to replace it.      The definition of transboundary is crossing or existing across national boundaries. So, transboundary water source means, water source that is shared among two or more countries.     These water sources must be protected in order to keep it clean. No country would want dirty water source for its community. This will cause food poisoning.      Moreover, it is important to keep it clean as water is used in our daily activities. Without water, life would be very hard. Water provides us drinking water and we use it many activities, such as showering and brushing our teeth. Especially for those who live far in the rural area.      There is one way for all of us to protect the transboundary water source but it requires co-operation from all sides of the boundary.  This can be done by saving water. Use water only when you really need it. Though it is very easy to save water, some of us still tend to waste it.      There are  many ways for us to save water, thus, protecting the transboundary water source. Firstly, by bathing. By taking a bath, we can save litres of water compared to when we shower. We can also save water flushing the toilet only when it is really “_needed_”.       Sometimes, countries would not co-operate and this can start war. This might happen in some areas in the future, but it is far from the ideal solution.       By saving water, we can avoid this from happening. Other than that, we can also play less for our water bills. So, as a conclusion, saving water is the best solution in protecting the transboundary water source.
