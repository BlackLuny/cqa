Im really stuck on whether to take French or German for GCSE because im at about the same level with both. loads of people told me that german was easy lik a year ago and now my teacher has told me they've made it even easier.

P.S. also with triple science and latin if french is really hard i dunno i if will be able to cope with it. thanks.

I'm 23 and hav a graduate degree in Commerce. I've been working on and off for 4 years at a job which I really hate while studying side by side.       Now I'm totally fed up. And really confused. I just want to pursue a course (a degree, master's, diploma, technical stuff anything) that would guarantee a secure career and really good money after completion.      Also because of the recent recession, I am confused as to which courses provide good future prospects. My primary interests are in automobile industry, racing and aviation. However, now I am so fed up and confused that I'm willing to pursue any course which will guarantee good money afterwards.      Since I would be the sole earner of my family in a few years, it's imperative that whatever I do pays me good money. And if its something that interests me, it would be icing on the cake.      So pls. let me know which streams/courses are hot and would guarantee a secure future.      Again, serious answers please. I am really fed up of doing courses that add nothing to my career/future.      Thanks!!

Ragtime was composed for the piano and emphasized a "ragged" style of music, syncopation.      3.

As in other art forms, such as dance and drama, improvisation in music means that it is created spontaneously or on the spur of the moment.      6.One of the most famous jazz musicians of our time, louis Armstrong, began his career by playing on street coners and in cafes in New Orleans.         7.

Choosing universities to apply to can be a rigorous task, especially for first-time freshmen. However, after reviewing the JU website, I can see my self fitting in perfectly. I would be an excellent addition to the incoming freshman this fall because I am a dedicated student, and I'm determined to be successful. As a person, I am very well-rounded. Growing up in the military lifestyle, I have moved around quite a bit. I have had the wonderful opportunities of visiting places that a lot of people only dream about, including the islands of Japan, Korea, and Guam. I have acquired wonderful social skills and have made friends across the map. Academically, I have more than enough drive and passion to excel. Over the past 4 years of my high school career, I have developed a strong interest in science and the human body. My fortunate experiences and interest in medicine have led me to what I believe is my ideal career goal. I would like to be a traveling nurse anesthetist. Upon being accepted to this university I feel that I would be well on my way to achieving goal. Furthermore, years down the line, I would be proud to say that I am a Jacksonville University alumni and a true Dolphin at heart.                No prompt or specific instruction was provided, and there was a 1000 character limit. So did I say enough, or is what I did say alright?    Thank you.

20090203123006AAoDtbz	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you please revise and edit this for me? Suggestions?	Against Stem Cell Research                Embryonic stem cells can turn into almost any cell, have been used in the treatment of cancer, and can fix damaged parts of the brain, heart, liver, and lungs. Adult stem cells can workthe same miracles without killing a life to get them. People who are for embryonic stem cell research seem not to understand that adult stem cells are used identically, and dont involve a death. Embryonic stem cell research must be stopped because it involves the murder of a living being and the adult stem cell alternative is used more efficiently.  A blastocyst in the womb, though only several hundred cells, already has enough chromosomes to be considered human, its alive, and already judged as either a male or a female.   If that blastocyst was allowed the chance to grow, it would have dreams and a future. If it had grown into an adult, it would still be human, alive, and either male or female, and because of this it still resembles what it was as a blastocyst. By taking away embryonic stem cells from a blastocyst, you would be erasing its life along with its aspirations it might have had if given the chance to advance in age. The Catholic Church also bans research that threatens the life of the human embryo for, according to the papal teaching reiterated frequently by the late John Paul II, human individuality, or ensoulment, commences from the moment of conception (Cornwell, 37). The Catholic Church believes it is a sin to carry on this experimentation with human life. Using embryonic stem cells and collecting them for treatment is considered unethical. Embryos do not survive the harvesting of stem cells; indeed, the stem cells are the embryo (Panno, 4). This is proof that by removing stem cells you are, in fact, removing a life at the same time. The embryo has no consent in the matter, therefore it should be considered a murder. With more pro-life supporters it would make it much easier to put an end to this crime.    This is only the first two paragraphs; do you think there is anything here that I should add or take away?

First of all, the toy train that Luke was lying on his stomach on the floor and idly ran the train back and forth of the rack reminds me of the toy train I used to have and which I played with it a lot. As well, it was the first toy that I received as a present for my first birthday. Also, the construction going on near Luke’s house reminds of when my neighbor moved and the house was demolished. I watched the construction right after school when I arrive back home. Furthermore, the feeling that Luke felt when he snuck out of his house of reminds of going back to school after a week of illness. Which I had the same feeling as Luke, which we forgot what fresh air felt like, filling his nostrils and lungs.
20090219234348AAP34lf	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone edit my paragraph?	There are many texts in the book similar to things that happened in the real world. The author, Haddix brings forth the possible problem of the future and using historical references such as, "the one child law" in China and how a possible mini-Holocaust could result because of it. I would say this It also addresses how a totalitarian government might take advantage of a food shortage to create such a law "no more than two children" as we see in the book, forcing people to forfeit their reproductive rights, as the government begins sterilizing women after Luke is born. As well as forcing parents to hide their children, so their children remain alive and well away from the population police. Through this, Haddix addresses how a totalitarian government like this becomes corrupt: taking land away from people, not allowing them to eat certain food, taking away their incomes, leaving them with little money. The people are left with a horrible life while the top officials or barons live richly and powerfully. The theme is to make people aware of what America could be like if we are not careful.

20090219224731AAIFQqG	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Am i stupid/bad for not graduating college @ 22 like everyone else (prospect nursing student)?	Okay you know how it only took 4 years to get through high school? well i thought college was supposed to work that way too but for some reason it's not for me.      College is kind of a little harder than high school and teachers in high school have a little more compassion for their students, whereas college professors are a$$holes and can fail you whenever they feel like it.      Side note: i bombed my SAT so i took the CPT and was 2 points short of passing on the reading portion so i had to take a couple of remedial classes. Then i kinda dropped some classes and failed some classes (but retook them and passed). I don't want to repeat that process anymore because i hate school, have ALWAYS hated school and just want to already have a career and get on w/ my life and do what i REALLY want to do (go 2 hollywood and become an actress, i know lame, lol) so now i'm taking like 2 or 3 @ the most.       However, i'm going for a nursing degree and they wan't you to do ALL these FRIGGIN pre-requiste courses (which pretty hard esp. Human Anatomy and Chemistry if you don't have the right teacher) BEFORE you can apply to the nursing program. I'm just worried about getting in cuz my gpa is a 2.6 right now (i know, it's low). THEN i'm getting all these horror stories about the nursing program itself and my head is all in a MESS, lol. AAAAAHHHH will i ever get out?       I planned on graduating @ 22 (i just turned 21 Feb. 1st) so doesn't look like that's gonna happen, so i thought 23, 24, but the nursing program is 2 years and if i plan on graduating at 23, 24, then that means NO ROOM for screw ups (dropping, failing, etc.) which might not be realistc because I KNOW i'm gonna end retaking a class or 2, PLUS that means i'm gonna have to get into the nursing program THIS FALL and i'm not done w/ all the pre-reqs, YIKES!       Gosh, i feel like such a horrible/terrible person. I feel like i'm wsting my life away. I feel like jumping off a bridge sometimes too, lmao, but don't worry i won't cuz i'm scared of heights. I'll just pull my hair out instead, lol. OMG! What if i graduate college at age 25 or 26 *GASP*! That's almost 30! UGH!

20090220072123AAJHHsM	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Which college should I go to?	I am a sophomore in high school but want to start looking into colleges. Living on Long Island, I would like to attend a university that is close to home (preferably the NYC area, but pretty much anything within 2 hours driving is okay). My GPA is a 4.0; overall average is a 97.6 currently, but fluctuates between 96-98 throughout the year. I am enrolled in all honors classes as well as a few electives (including Latin and Science Research). Next year, I will be taking all IB Classes and will (hopefully) receive the IB Diploma. My extracurriculurs are sufficient; I am devoted to 3 clubs and volunteer at a local nursing home. I've been involved in many science fairs and math fairs, and received a gold on the National Latin Exam.      My dream job is to be a pediatrician. I really want to go to a good college, which will hopefully make my admission into medical school slightly easier. I'm aware that tuition is increasing for prestigious schools as well as medical school. My family is in the Upper Middle Class...definately not rich; we live in a $650,000 house. I've already started saving for college.      So, does anyone have any suggestions? I would ideally like to attend a college that also has a medical school, so I could stay at the same school for Pre-Med and Med.      Thanks so much!

The male becomes pink because a protein X secreted by the female binds to and activates a protein Y on the male that is responsible for the color change. You have isolated a strain of the microorganism that produces a mutant (altered) form of protein Y. This strain behaves normally at temperatures lower than 37oC, but at higher temperatures, it cannot turn pink. Could any of the following changes in mutant protein Y explain your results? If so, which ones, and explain why.   a. It makes an extra hydrogen bond to protein X.   b. It makes fewer hydrogen bonds to protein X.   c. It makes a covalent bond to protein X.   d. It is completely unfolded at temperatures lower than 37oC.   e. It is completely unfolded at temperatures higher than 37oC.   f. It is unable to bind to protein X at any temperature.   4 days ago - 4 hours left to answer.

20090220061010AAtNkUF	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me edit this paragraph please...10 points!!?	Please help me edit this, it's abit long sorry.      He was depressed just like every other man when the economy collapsed on them. It was a time when every person dreamed of a warm place to stay where they didn't need to worry about their next meal. A place where they all wished they had monely left over to buy that new album, a necklace at the mall, or maybejust a better brand of coffee at the grocery. But beyond the unreachable clouds of joyful dreams, there were nightmares. Allan was tortured repeatedly in his nightmares, and they have become so frequent he was almost certain that the things he dreamed of was actually reality. Allan was confused by his real life and his nightmares; he often talked to people at the bar about things that only happened in his dreams, and those people thought of him as either mentally ill or too drunk. It was weird how people could become so out of place in the society without a job. Finding a job was becoming a job itself, he was always waking up at the same time each morning, returning with disappointment on the same subway each night. There was no connection between one day and the next. He even lost track of the date...was it January, February, or maybe December? He sat on the stairs in the subway tunnel  alone on Silent Night, listening to the angelic voices of children as they performed christmas carols above in the public park. Tears rolled down his scarred cheeks as he remembered his childhood, never having to care about not saving enough money to pay next week's taxes, never had to compare prices over and over again in the supermarket and making budgets. Allan opened the bottle cap and gulped down another bottle of beer. He knew he was breaking his own rules on no drinking, but that was the only way for him to escape his hard life. He was ashamed of himself for not meeting up to his own standards. Allan was a lawyer, and though he had graduated three years ago, he had absolutely no experience because he had never found a job. Now Allan relies on sleeping pills to fall into a deep, undisturbed sleep, but each morning he wakes up restlessly by his heart pounding against his chest, and he thinks, "maybe today is the day that I've been waiting for, maybe today I will find a job", and that was what kept his head up and looking forward to tomorrow. Each time the boss turned him down, each time he heard the pity in their voice and saw their sympathetic eyes, he would feel a pang of anger arousing from within. It made his mind scream, "DO NOT LOOK AT ME LIKE I AM SOME KIND OF DIRTY SAVAGE" But all he could manage each time was a hopeless whisper and a forced, broken smile. Allan slumped down the stairs and pushed the broken door to the harsh world, his world. He saw all kinds of people lingering around the streets, rummaging for meals with vacant hearts and empty stomachs...and he was no different. He would find himself staring up at the broken windows on 66th street for some breakfast in the early morning and watching the war-filled newspapers flow down second avenue for dinner. There was nothing left for him. The cold city was a place for the wealthy people, and there will never be a place for him in this society. He was blinded by the street lights and tricked by society's winners. Pursuiting happiness will never be an option for him.      *what do you think of it??

20090220063436AAr4ixe	Education & Reference;Teaching	Is it ethical for a university to hire "un-experienced" professors?	I do not find it fair that students are forced to pay ridiculous sums of money to have an un-experienced professor teach a course in which they are not familiar with. For example, my economics "professor" just rewrites everything (word for word) from the chapter on the whiteboard, and tells us to copy – that’s it! Why would I pay some goon to rewrite everything from the book when I can just read the material myself? I thought the point of a professor was to enlighten students on the material. Why would anyone want to sit in a class for 3 hours and watch someone re-write the book when they have it in their hands? Anyone could teach a college course if all they are doing re-writing the book on the board and asking students to copy.      Another issue I have is with financial aid. For the past 3 months, I have been waiting on a response from financial aid regarding an INS document that the school sent to them. This document is to verify my status as a permanent resident of the U.S.A, which usually takes a month to receive a response from them. I know that the college has no control of when they get response, but they make no effort in following up with the document. Instead, for the past three months, they have been telling to “come back next week to see if we have received a response from them.” I find this to be an act of negligence on the school’s part, so is there anything I can do, legally?      P.S This is not only with just one professor, there are quite a few of these goons in the school.

20090220065228AAwTpVW	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone help me with my essay grammar and punctuation?	this is the correct essay i need help on , i just need someone to proof read it for me.. thanks!       “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”    “The accident”        Every high school senior likes to party in their few last months of high school and do not think about consequences that may result. Im sure that every one of those high school seniors have been advice many times  by their parents in order for them to prevent things from happening, many of them do listen and many of them do not.    I was once one of these high school seniors.  When I was 17 in 2003; I use to love going out to parties, clubs, and loved driving around town, just having a good time every Friday and Saturday night.  I would never think about what would happen in these parties or cruises I would take around town, My mother would warn me about the possibilities in getting involve in car accident and other malisons things that can happen at parties, she would tell me to stay home and do useful things with my time other then just going to parties.   I would never listen, I would tell my mom that will not happen to me, I myself thought I was very careful and conscious of everything I did but unfortunately not everything turns out the way I planned.       On May 16, 2003, on a Saturday night; I was getting off from a high school drill meet and a couple of friends (Ana, Cynthia, Cathy and Cassie) and I decided to go out to a house party.    As Ana drove us to the party on the feeder road of 45N and 610 a  red pick up truck hit us in full speed making the car we were in flip one time and spin two times,  Next thing I knew it was silence  for a minute and I screamed  “ Ana!!, Cassie!!  Is everybody okay?!?” I tried to move but I could not,   my hand was stuck in between the broken window and the edge of the door, then I heard Cathy scream “  I’m bleeding from my legs I cant move my leg!”, then Ana cried out loud “  I made it out of the car, is everyone okay ? I’m calling 911!”,   “help me!” I said, “ im stuck!  I cant move my left hand is stuck on the edge of the door please help me!”   Cassie claimed out of the car okay just with a few scratches and bruises,  pulled tried to pull Cathy out of the car as she could and then tried to pull me out,  “ I cant pull you out your fingers are stuck underneath the door it’s to heavy I do not want to hurt you”.  The paramedics came 15min’s they helped me get out of the car and luckily every body else was okay with just minor scratches, scraps and bruises.   I only had 2 surgies on my left hand both middle fingers.  2 weeks later after the accident,   my mother told me how afraid she was when the accident happen and  I thought to myself at the time,  my mother was right, I should of listen to prevent the accident I had so that I would not be in the situation I was in.         Take my experience for example; do not do the same mistake I did, I learned from my mistake that is how I learned my lesson to think and listen the advices that our loves ones tells us think it is not because they do not wants for us young people to go out and have a good time or to enjoy our lives but because they want for us to be okay, safe, and encourage us to prevent anything severe, bad that is out there from happening to us.   Listen to your parent’s advice and everything they tell you that they are always right; think before you act to avoid harmful incidents.       An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

I fibbed a little on my Fafsa last year (I know I shouldn't have, but can't  change it now) about being married, I did not get caught (thankfully) even though my Fafsa went thru verification. Well, this year, I'm not going to lie about being married... but I think I have to fib about WHEN I got married (since I lied last year)... my question is: Does the FAFSA know exactly when you got married? I was married in July 2008, but I need to say I was married in October 2008... will they catch it?

I'm going to a D.O. school in the fall, and I was really excited, but when I told my extended family (my immediate family was proud too), they asked me why I didn't become a "real" (M.D.) doctor, and it made me really sad.

20090220072233AAgqX0T	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone please edit my short paragraph?	There are not many other connections that I can think of, though more for text to self. Firstly, the toy train that Luke was lying on his stomach on the floor and idly ran the train back and forth of the rack reminds me of the toy train I used to have and which I played with it a lot. As well, it was the first toy that I received as a present for my first birthday. Also, the construction going on near Luke’s house reminds of when my neighbor moved and the house was demolished. I watched the construction right after school when I arrive back home. Furthermore, the feeling that Luke felt when he snuck out of his house of reminds of going back to school after a week of illness. Which I had the same feeling as Luke, which we forgot what fresh air felt like, filling his nostrils and lungs.
