mZlPj8Guaa	Verizon right now is trying to swallow up Alltel. I have heard of some Alltel customers complaining of dropped phone calls and such.<br>  <br>  As far as contracts are conserned? When your wife's contract is up, she probably will have to take up a Verizon contract. It might be cost benefit if she just simply MERGED onto your plan (If she wants to). That way there will be a cost savings.

They can be found on craigslist in a city near you.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	You cannot buy an SLR for under $200. You'll need to spend $450 with a lens and you NEED a lens.|`|lYIijzpQaa	This is not an SLR camera! It's a point and shoot, disguised as an SLR. Not that there is anything wrong with the camera itself, but if you're looking for an SLR, this is not what you want. Look into used Canon Rebel or Nikon D40 bodies. I recently purchased a second-hand Canon Rebel for $275, and it's in mint condition. I recommend doing a little more research before buying!

6beL9zycaa	Take it back where you got it... let them restore it or give you another one.  You shouldn't have to keep dealing with it.  Sometimes you just get a "lemon" which may be what happened here.  I've had several phones that kept having problems, (batteries wouldn't hold a charge, etc.) & even 'tho they'll try not to, if you go to the place you got it & make a big enough scene, they will  take it back.  Just make sure you bring your receipt & everything it came in.  Good luck.

ZWHZto1Baa	It sounds like the ports on the back of your tv are bad.  I think you got a lemon.  If you just bought, you should be able to return it and get a new one with no problems.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	First off, you spent way too much for those cables.  I'm using generic brand HDMI cables from Monoprice.com which were $7 each with no problems with either my PS3 or 360.<br>  <br>  Next, the 360.  There was a bug with the 360's new dashboard software where some people lost audio when they were using HDMI.  A patch has been released.  To get it, create a Xbox Live account, and go online.  The patch will be downloaded automatically and should fix the problem.  <br>  <br>  Xbox Live is free - it's only if you want to play games online that you need to pay for a Gold account.  You'll get a free month trial when you first create your account anyways (each console gives you a free trial account for the first 3 accounts you create.) <br>  <br>  The PS3 is more confusing.  You should just be able to connect the PS3 to your TV with a HDMI cable, power it on, and have the PS3 auto-detect the HDMI cable.  That's all there is to it.<br>  <br>  The 360 shows that the TV's HDMI ports are working, so the problem seems to be with the PS3 itself.  The only thing I can think of is you somehow got a returned unit that someone used long enough to complete the setup wizard.  However, you did the 2 beep thing, which should have reset the PS3's video settings and caused it to recognize you're using a HDMI cable.  I don't know...  I'd take the PS3 back again.  If you get a 3rd one that still does this, maybe it's time to give Sony a call, if for no other reason to let them know their console apparently doesn't work with this TV.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	$2,700+ in three weeks?  Holy crap.  What'd you do money bags, rob a bank?<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with the cables (except that since they're Monster you paid too much for them).  If you get the menu screen on the PS3 and you have video and audio output set to HDMI there's nothing wrong with it either.  Same goes with the 360.  I would say your problem here is the TV.<br>  <br>  If you have the PS3 on and you run an HDMI from it to the TV you need to select the right source (i.e. "HDMI 1").  It sounds like you've done this.  So I say it's the TV.|`|bRJAqc8Baa	Peter D is right on point with this one.|`|tg2eb59caa	sounds like a problem with cables or tv

This enables them to transfer it across, you may have to wait a few days before it happens though.|`|idFvwX9zaa	Your PAC code is what you request from your network provider, so your current mobile phone number can be released from that network, and transferred to a new account with a different network.

But.....<br>  <br>  If you want good HD pics, you need to exchange your sd cable box for an HD cable box with your provider.  Many don't change more for the HD box, so that it might cost the same, or very close.  And there is no way an sd cable box can provide HD tv.<br>  <br>  Then be sure to connect the HD box to your tv with either component (red/green/blue) cables or HDMI.  Either will provide the same quality pic.|`|AA11539218	You can connect the STB to your tv with component video cables instead of the RCA cables...or use an HDMI cable if you have that option.

You can convert any file, it has a list of loads of formats to convert them to. As much as i love my ipod and itunes it is annoying because they have very different software. Another bonus about video piggy is you can download songd from youtube. You just have to copy and paste the URL into videopiggy. You can get the videos or just the audio. In a year I have used video piggy so much. The quality never goes worse when you convert. I have cut down money on iTunes because now i just get them off you tube.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	That placement plan is a good deal, assuming the terms are solid.  As far as the player goes, it's an outdated model.  If you don't mind missing out on some of the later features (i.e. BD Live) then go for it.  I see it's about $210.  That seems a bit steep for a refurbished player that's no longer in production.  I mean, the Panasonic DMP-BD35 was only $230 at Costco last month.  Best Buy, hardly a place for bargains, has the Samsung BD-P1500 for $250.  I'd say that player is better than Sony's 301, although not as good as the 350.|`|FgTkF31iaa	If it is refurbished it will have the same warranty as a new unit, My experience with ELECTRONICS is if the are going to go bad they go bad in the first two weeks  so buying the extra coverage for inexpensive units isn' t worth the money|`|eHWRodp3aa	That's a good plan that I would use as far as the refurbished player.

a0Q1x7jnaa	Hello there!<br>  <br>  The R4 card is an adapter, where you have to plug a Micro-SD memory card into the back of it. Therefore, you need a Micro-SD card in order to use an R4 card with your Nintendo DS.<br>  <br>  Please look carefully as to the type of R4 card you have. The R4v2 card (the original, if you will) can only take up to 2GB TransFlash Micro-SD memory cards, while the R4 SDHC card and the R4-III card can both take larger memory, up up 4GB/8GB Micro-SDHC and possibly higher.<br>  <br>  I would recommend purchasing an original R4 card from a trusted online retailer who would test your cards prior to sending them out, such as <a href="http://www.NDS-Gear.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.NDS-Gear.com.</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eJ97Qdooaa	Yes, you will need a microSD card.  If you buy the original R4, you'll only need a 2gb as thats the max it'll take.  R4 version 3 R4s will take the SDHC cards that goes up to 8gbs.<br>  <br>  For more info, you can go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.wiilovemario.com/R4DS+-+R4+Revolution+for+DS+(Nintendo+DS+Lite+blank+cartridge!)" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiilovemario.com/R4DS+-+R4+Re...</a>|`|AA12376085	Hi<br>  I have been a custmer of unlockiphonelive.com which selling unlock iphone chip. they provide good service for my iphone,<br>  Now they aslo provide the the solution for your need, they selling R4 and R4III card with Micro sd card which is the cheapest online (I think)<br>  You can try their quality servcie.

AA11539218	Depending on how old the 35mm is then yes, the lenses could work...All Canon Digital SLR's use Canon EF and EF-S Lenses.  You could always take your lenses into a photo shop and ask them to make sure.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	If the lenses are EF, then they will work on any of the new Canon DSLR cameras.<br>  <br>  If they are FD lenses, then no.  Canon's new EOS systems only use EF or EF-S lenses.|`|oRnPNJRFaa	Well, canon camera have a EF mount if theyre old & a EF-S mount if theyre new. Your lens would go on any camera that supports those mounts but otherwise it wont work especially if its a nikon, no way.<br>  Check the mount on the camera u wanna buy.<br>  Good Luck|`|Bv5f9Picaa	I believe that if they are Canon and your DSLR is a Canon they should be compatible. I think it depends on the body style, though. Like if you have a Rebel 35mm and a Rebel DSLR then I think those should work. I'm not an expert though, so maybe you should check out the Canon website :]
C1c8nPotaa	Maybe the battery is completely dead. It may need a new battery.

The other thing to know, is which one is the easiest for you to navigate through their menus.<br>  <br>  When you choose the one you like the best, it will be YOUR choice, not ours.  After all, you will be spending money for years building your system ... it had better be the one you want, not the one I want.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	The Rebel XSI Is the clear Choice ( in this situation ) <br>  <br>  It has more resolution, no autofocus issues, a larger screen, and live view, things you do not necessarily need, but will definitely take advantage of. <br>  <br>  Don't listen to other people here with biased opinions.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Both are great.Personally I would go with Canon Revel XSi.Eas to use.Excellent pictures.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA85A?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0012YA85A" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA...</a>

Hu0rtjHhaa	if you mean photos, it is actually quite easy  first, bring up itunes  next, insert your ipod into the computer with the usb port  once the ipod comes up, look near the top of the ipod screen for the different tabs there.  go from summary, which you will be on, to the photos tab.  once there, click the checkbox that lets you sync photos to your ipod.  alternatively, you can also click the checkbox that lets you sync only selected photo folders to your ipod.  either way, it is quite easy to do now that you know how.  once on the ipod, all you have to do is go to the photos space which is under music on the main menus.  you can view the photos there.    hope this helped :-)

Pour ceux qui ne peuvent pas l'avoir, cela dmarre par le satellite en juin sur ASTRA (Canal) et Atlanbird 3 et tout cela sans abonnement. Mais 230  250  le terminal + la parabole cela fait un peu cher.  L'avenir serait d'avoir des tls locales comme la radio FM  l'avait fait.

Enfin bon, ayant t pendant longtemps un drogu de tl (comme beaucoup de monde), j'ai effectu un virage  180 et je considre maintenant que la TV est :  - une perte de temps monumentale  - un mdia provoquant une trs forte addiction    Ma TV me sert quasi-uniquement de moniteur pour diffrents appareils.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Here are some of their arguments and why it's flawed:    1.  The PS3 costs 600, while the 360 costs 400.  It's true, but the PS3 has Blu-ray, Wi-Fi capabilities, various memory slots, HDMI output, etc.  For the 360 to get all those PS3 capabilities, it will cost well over 600 bucks.  Just the HD-DVD add-on player is 200 bucks.    2.  The PS3 graphics and 360 graphics looks the same:  True, but they're comparing 1st gen launch graphics of the PS3 to the 2nd gen graphics of the 360.  To make it even, compare the PS3 games (Resistance, Virtua Fighter 5, etc) to the 360's launch games (Cameo, Perfect Dark Zero, Dead or Alive 4).  Which games look better.    3.  360 has better games than the PS3.  True, for now, but what about the future?  The PS3 just launched, so don't expect a lot of great games.  The 360 has been out for over a year, so it should have better games than the PS3.    4.  360 has more games than the PS3.  Again, the 360 has been out for over a year, while the PS3 just launched, so don't expect the PS3 to have a lot of games early on.  Experts predict that the PS3 will have the most 3rd party support, which means it will have more games.    One final thing, throw away the rumble because Sony and Immersion just settle their lawsuit.  Pretty soon, the Sixaxis will have tilt function as well as rumble.    Read the story here:  http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_...    Nintendo doesn't use any real disks because it's trying to prevent software piracy.  Can you blame them?  Just look at all these questions about how to use Nintendo ROMS on the PSP or how to play Nintendo games on the computer.|`|a40224c2bd2a5a6c079ff3896d90e996aa	Xbox 360 has better games and is much cheaper.  Not a fan of the Wii.  The people I know who did get a PS3 say they don't enjoy it as much as the Xbox 360.|`|6UBKg0GVaa	PS3 is better just because its better. 360 is old and obselete.|`|4X3XT2Weaa	The wiis pretty good. The ps3 sucks because it's way overpriced. Sure, 200 bucks is fine, but any higher is a hassle. It's just overpriced, and the PS3 games aren't as cool as 360's game, like "Lost Planet." The PS3's main failure was the release. Way overpriced, and a scary plastic baby for a commericail.|`|AreF6LYuaa	Well right now the Xbox 360 Supports the HD-DVDs. So you can add that on there if you wanna watch HD movies. Its Sony vs Toshiba + Microsoft. Which is funny because Toshiba actually helped design the Blu-Ray Processors.      Right now the Xbox 360 has alot better games. Because its been out alot longer.     The graphics right now are better than the PS3. And that's because Microsoft has had alot of time to work extensively on the graphics. BUT in the future the PS3 will soar above the Xbox 360 as long as you have a 1080p TV. Right now the Xbox is a better choice...but as far as the future...PS3 is the way to go.|`|AMKh4HXyaa	i'm gonna play my 360 before paying $15,000 for a ps3 with barely any games on it|`|cFlxpIejaa	maybe because it is cheaper and it looks better.|`|Zb9njZl7aa	360 is far better than the ps3....get over it lol|`|Cm7VPF9Jaa	Wow... for one, the Xbox slaughters the PS3 in every way starting with the complex guts, to the sleek outer look.    The PS3 is bulky and limited to lame games...    But even past that, the Wii is by far the most innovative machine ever.    You probably cant even get off your lazy bum to play a game of tennis and have to resort to playing Sonic with a bag of chips on your stomach.
3b5730f865e8950a697171b3cc495ac1aa	Then get it. It is way worth it, trust me, hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of fun. Wii sports is so fun!!! Baseball, bowling, tennis, golfing, and more!|`|AA11235430	When used properly, I think video games are a great source of entertainment. Alot of people out there still think of video games as bad. This isn't always true. People say they promote violence. I watched a documentary a couple of weeks ago and there are plenty of other bad influences out there, video games can just be one minor cause. And not all games are violent, plus if your worried about you kids, check the rating! Granted some bad things have happened around video games, I have also seen some good come out of them.    Video games can keep people out of drugs, being stoned or drunk wont get you a high score! Those people out there who are disabled and can't get out to do things that alot of other people do, video games help. I have heard people refer to video games as a good source of pain management, gives there mind something to focus on other than pain.    I've been a video gamer for years, since super mario bros 1 and the commador 64. Its a great hobby. There is a great selection out there based on everybodies tastes, me personally, I like role playing games. Role playing games have a tendency to have a longer value that other games like 3d shoot em up games. An RPG I will play for months upon months, 3D shoot em ups only last me maybe a week. but that is only 2 types of games. There are many many more!    I have never been dissatisfied investing my money into games, especially when I buy a console. Make sure you read reviews on games to find out what you are buying first. Sometimes you can get a dud game that is really boring, kinda like shopping for a movie rental but more expensive. I would suggest get the Wii, and get games you have played and enjoyed, and if you want more do a search on a major search engine for "game reviews" and find what your interested in.    Happy gaming!|`|3c6490c99681167f068056c1bd94bc0baa	Oh!Thanx for the question.  Video games[recent] are like now the real life.  In NFS Most Wanted the rockport police department sticks to ya like a real police cargo. In Godfather I feel like I am really in that time. In Carbon, the drift and canyon race is so real.In Fifa 07, I feel like I am really a footballer though I never went to a stadium.  In fact as days go by the recent games more likely to our real life adventure.  Thats why Iove video games.  I have an PSP, an PS2 and hopin for an PS3.

Sert a rien d'achter un lecteur pour l'un ou l'autre maintenant sachant que bientot, je crois que LG sort un lecteur capable de lire a la fois les HD-DVD et les BlueRay.  Mais aujourd'hui, le DVD a encore quelques beau jours devant lui, ces 2 nouveaux supports ne representant pas reelement d'avance technologique (hormis la taille sur un disque et donc la taille de l'image) comme l'a ete le DVD face au bon vieux magneto, cela demendra en outre un nouveau sacrifice du porte monnaie pour s'equiper avec une tele, un ampli et un lecteur capables d'exploiter et compatibles avec les possibilites offertes par ces nouveaux medias : Voir un film HD en 1080p sur une tele cathodique son mono, ca le fait autant qu'avec un lecteur DVD.
Hu0rtjHhaa	its pretty easy if you know how  first, look at the songs in list position  on the left of each song is a box with checkmark.  keep the ones you want checked, and uncheck the ones you don't want on the ipod.  next, insert your ipod.  when the ipod screen comes up, go to the bottom where it says options. there will be a checkbox that says only sync checked items.  click this. then re-sync your ipod.  from now on, the computer will only sync the checked songs or other items to your ipod.|`|f4aeec9947e5edb8dcde9f944f656f3baa	Usually when I take music off I just go into itunes and highlight and right click the one I don't want and when I right click I hit delete then it usually says something like "are you sure you want to move this song to the recycle bin" and I say yes and then go back and sync the ipod and the sonds will be taken off

You should consider buying a Wii if you're looking for games that aren't rated 'M'.  You'll have WAY more fun playing non-m-rated games on the Wii, than you will playing other non-m-rated games for the 360.

AA11585953	An infrared port is like....like a small little dark red spot on your phone. Its not meant to be an actual port, but like it sends wireless signals to whatever your trying to pair it up with.|`|5835a468059ae92a222bcbb7109b32a0aa	do you mean infrared port?  Infrared port or IrP is used to pair another device with IrP.  You can share, send, receive data, such as pictures, notes, ringtones, MP3 files, etc by activating the IrP of both paired units.  the paired units' ports  must be facing each other with no more than 50 cm. apart (depending on sensitivity of units) inorder to "talk" with each other.
45752e591b496c12323b67b389115b24aa	Yes, you can download major television shows off of iTunes (for a cost of course). The Zune is a little bigger and bulkier, but you get to transfer videos, songs and files from person to person wirelessly. Your choice, however, it does have TV shows.|`|5835a468059ae92a222bcbb7109b32a0aa	Yes, but it depends on three things:  1.  Your ipod should be able to play video.  Check the model of your intended ipod.  2.  The length of the video all depends on the ipod's  memory.  Purchase the highest possible memory capacity your money can buy.  3.  your ability to use a computer to convert your video files, previousl;y recorded TV show,  to the format of the ipod.

Hard to use because of the touch screen.  The outer part is very sensitive.  Its like and Ipod I hear (don't have one), but you have the option to set the sensitivity level to what ever you want.  I send many half typed (not finished) text messages all the time because i press a button on accident and it just does it's own thing (that's how sensitive it is).  But again, great looking phone.  Has a navigation system that I absolutely love.  Get ready though, you need an extended batter and a car charger.  Because it does so many diff. things, it does not hold it's charge too well.  With the extended battery I was still charging it every two days.  Love the red one and the black one, but the black on needs Lot's of TLC due to finger prints.

Hu0rtjHhaa	first, make sure your iTunes and iPod are completely up to date.  Take one library, and sync it to your iPod completely.  When this is done, transfer the ipod to the new computer/itunes.  it will ask you if you want to transfer songs or erase and sync.  select transfer songs.  now, all the songs will be on both computers.  unfortuately, the ipod can only be synced with one itunes at a time, so it is usually a good idea to consolidate the library on one computer|`|yJOWUzyLaa	There are several software programs that let you do this, although Apple, itunes, doesnt want you to do this so they make it difficult. One of them is PodUtil, you can just google it and follow the directions is gives you.  There is also a couple different ones for videos called Cucusoft.

Hu0rtjHhaa	depends on what type of media player u are using  if its windows media player, or itunes, etc. . .  usually, first create a playlist of the songs that you want to burn to cd.  select the playlist.  then go to options or look for a button that says burn cd or something to that effect.  the cd will burn if it has enough space.  keep in mind that cd's are 1 time burn, and not reusable  in itunes, the burn button appears in the lower right corner when you have selected a playlist    hope this helped
Hu0rtjHhaa	lol  sorry, but the orange part is essential  other means the text for the songs, games, calendar, notes, stopwatch program, all that stuff.  its not just useless stuff you can delete.  so its there to stay.  usually though, it doesn't take up much room so you should be good  hope this helped :-)|`|f28068866a8e4ef675aaacb1044d3b1faa	This organge spot is your CD album covers. Not only the graphical album covers but the other data that is stored on your ipod to keep it going, like settings, back light options and other things.
Hu0rtjHhaa	this problem is really not that hard, so i don't understand why so many people have trouble with it  anyways, it easy once you know how to do it.  make sure your ipod and itunes are both completely up to date.  also, all of your songs must be legally bought    then, take your ipod and connect it to the computer that you want to transfer the songs to.  a few seconds later, a dialogue box will come up saying  erase and sync ipod or  transfer songs to itunes    choose to transfer songs and the songs will copy themselves to itunes, although it might take awhile since you have 10K songs.    hope this helped

EY1Il1GJaa	As far as I know...no.  The limit would be your storage capacity.  I've read on multiple forums (including this one:  http://forums.macrumors.com/archive/inde... that people have had libraries with well over 50,000 songs in them, and some with even more than 90GB.  So, you should be safe.    Currently, I have about 40GB of music in my iTunes library and I'm all gravy.  :)|`|nh39hJkOaa	You should be able to store as many as you want. Well, as many as you can fit on your HDD. :]|`|yDvVJI3qaa	As long as you have available space on your hard drive and Ipod if you use an Ipod with Itunes. I knew someone that had well over 4,000 songs in a 30GB Ipod. Basically your hard drive/Ipod will determine how many songs you can hold on there. I have not reached my limit on my Ipod yet so I would not be able to tell you what happens when you pass the Ipod's memory limit. Hope this helps|`|2xK3o7oUaa	No but there is a limit on your ipod|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	Only as much as your computer could hold. There is no upward limit on how much you can have in iTunes, only when you run out of space to store the files on your computer will you run out of space. Of course, that's space on your computer, not in iTunes itself.     I personally use a 150 GB external hard-drive to store my music.  If I ever obtained that much music, I could hold thousands of songs, probably tens of thousands.

Djn2qUeRaa	Il faut savoir ce que tu vas en faire premirement.    Si tu as dj des accessoires compatibles (objectifs, flash...) d'une marque, pour des raisons videntes, il serait bte de changer et d'avoir tout  racheter.    Le meilleur rapport qualit prix, pour un reflex de qualit et peu onreux, c'est sans doute le Pentax k100D super (que je vais m'offrir dans quelques jours). Pour 500 euros voir moins tu repars avec un reflex numrique et d'un objectif 18-55 de bonne qualit, pas comme certains...    Une chose, primordiale: essaye le avant d'acheter. Mme si tu l'achte sur internet, va dans une fnac... et essaye, mme plusieurs modles. (dans la catgorie du pentax K100D super, il y a le nikon D40 et le sony alpha 100). Demande  avoir les batteries, comme ?a tu peux naviguer dans les menus. (Moi je supporte pas les menus des panasonic et comme je ne connaissait pas pentax avant, j'ai demand  essayer pour voir si ?a me convenait.)    Grossomodo, ce qui change sur des appareils plus haut de gamme, c'est le  traitement de l'image et la mcanique qui sont de meilleure qualit (pentaprismes au lieu de pentamiroir...), Un viseur plus large, des rglages plus prcis  dans certains cas et  des fonctions en plus, mais inutiles pour un dbutant ou un amateur sans prise de tte. Ils sont aussi trs rapides, bien que les reflex dbutants le sont tout galement.    Les reflex numriques sont tous entirement dbrayables, experts ou non. Certains sont stabiliss au niveau du boitier comme les Pentax et Sony, cela vite de payer une fortune les optiques stabilises.    Dans la gamme expert, le Pentax K10D  moins de 1000 euros avec 2 objectifs reprsente le meilleur rapport qualit/prix. Il est en concurrence directe avec les nikon D80 et le canon 40D qui avoisinent les 1200 euros nus...    Aprs, au dessus  moins d'une vritable passion et d'une utilit en adquation avec le prix , la technologie et la puissance des appareils, ce n'est pas la peine d'aller chercher si loin.    Pour moins de 500 euros !!! Le pentax k100d super, mais juste avec l'objectif 18-55 mais qui me semblerai un peu court pour un circuit auto... rajoute quelques euros et offre toi le avec le kit 2 objectifs !!!    Sinon prend un bridge, tu ne dpassera pas ton budget, zoom puissant (de 12X  18X), moins de 500 euros, objectif de qualit mais ce n'est pas un rflex. Vise  l'cran ou au viseur (mais c'est un cran lcd  l'intrieur). certains sont trs rapides. Dans ces modles, je te conseillerai plutot panasonic et fujifilm, mais aprs le reste est bon aussi|`|PIPALFhSaa	NIKON !!!!|`|IPdsK0kvaa	Aprs 45 ans de photo, j'ai laiss tomber l'argentique  regret il y a 6 mois et j'ai achet un Pentax K100D.

8e3cc6d7a159a8a4ca1c3346046739dcaa	The best way is to very carefully clean the tape with a soft cloth (e.g., a lens cloth) and a solution of mild soapy water, followed by a water rinse. Do not scrub too hard, as you may damage the magnetic layer on the tape. If this layer is rubbed off, the content is also rubbed off.    This is a very finicky operation, because you will either have to draw the tape out of the housing foot by foot or disassemble the cartridge, remove the tape, and then reassemble the cartridge. It is difficult to unroll and then neatly roll up the tape afterwards. If you decide to clean the tape in the cartridge, you will need to remove the sprung flap or to tape it up out of the way. The tape is locked when the cartridge is removed from the VCR, but can be unlocked by pressing a recessed button near the centre of the cartridge underside. You may be forced to disassemble the cartridge to clean the interior, as it is also quite possible that some interior parts are also contaminated.    Mold and mildew may leave stains on the tape or may have permanently damaged it in some fashion. I do not recommend using chemical cleaners on the tape itself, because of the potential for damage to the tape if the wrong chemical is used. Some people like alcohol-based cleaners, but I prefer to avoid them when cleaning media.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	How is it dirty?    Clean the outside with a wet cloth and dry it. It's only plastic, after all.    If the TAPE has something on it, it's ruined.|`|YMuhQv2Paa	If it is outside, just clean it carefully...    If it's the tape, use the floppy disk cleaner fluid. Use the cotton.    If its torn, just tape it with finesse.

Besides taking well-exposed hi-quality 5 megapixel pictures, it uses a standard set of rechargeable double AA batteries which last a very long time - 300 shots per set of rechargeables;  2. Has a 3x optical zoom;  3. The flash setting for "red-eye" correction is on the navigator wheel and not within a submenu;  4. It's very small and light;  5. Uses inexpensive SD memory cards;  6. The digital video feature takes wonderful "sound" videos which are noise free. It records the piano very well with it's built-in microphone;  7. It comes with a USB 2.0 transfer cable which you connect to your USB computer port;  8. Has tripod mount on bottom of camera;  9. And the price is a mere $119 [sold at Samy's Camera - www.samys.com, and Staples.com; $99 at amazon.com]    Review(s) can be found at www.amazon.com [Query: "Nikon Coolpix L10" along with pictures provided by satisfied purchasers.]    Good luck!|`|qTi1Y3oGaa	Find out how many megapixels it has.

Plug it into your computer and if you can get it to idenify your iPod, restore it (wipe out everything on it and restart it.  Sometimes it just needs to be wiped out.)

GOAhkdCMaa	Compre qualquer uma Sony, com resolu??o acima de 5mp, de preferencia que filme com som, com cart?o memoria de 256mega para cima e que tambm a mquina tenha uma boa memoria interna|`|78103b6d3111fcc24870a6ef2e68c2ddaa	Camera  Canon. Depois vem Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus e Fuji.    Bom, tome cuidado, porque tem gente aqui que te recomendou comprar tnis e n?o camera digital (com todo respeito rsrs).    Eu vou direto no ponto e te dou modelos. Compre uma Canon que  certeza de qualidade e timas fotografias.    Canon A460 - R$350, Canon A530 - R$ 350 e Canon A550 - R$ 500. Excelentes cameras, sendo a A550 mais completa e que filma melhor. Custa uns 500 reais no mercadolivre.    Cuidado com recomenda??es de marcas famosas, mas que ficam fazendo recall - chamada para troca de pe?as - de suas cameras, visto que costumam dar defeito e dor de cabe?a.    Para terminar, o que uma boa camera digital deve ter:    Pelo menos 5 megapixels - o que j serve para revelar uma foto do tamanho uma folha de A4, porque MP n?o significa qualidade de imagem, mas sim tamanho da imagem;  Ter zoom optico de 3x ou mais;  Boas lentes e bom conjunto optico;  Filmagem com udio e na resolu??o VGA 640x480 com 30fps (trinta quadros por segundo);  Abertura de foco come?ando em 2.8 ou menor (descreve-se assim f/2.8 - 5.5);  E ter op??es de tempo de exposi??o da lente etc, coisas que geralmente s uma Canon tem.    Quanto  compra, lembre-se que o segredo do mercadolivre  comprar com vendedores lderes (acima de 1.000 pontos e com avalia??o acima de 97% positiva) e, de preferncia comprar para retirar em m?os e pagar no ato ou comprar por sedex  cobrar. Se quiser parcelar no cart?o de crdito, tambm vale, mas sob a condi??o de liberar o pagamento somente na retirada do produto.|`|bb6101b364c448a80ef1f127e6456e49aa	Eu recomendo a Sony... todas elas s?o boas, mas vi umas com pre?o em conta no site das Lojas policarpo.

Se for finalidade amadora, v pelo pre?o, mas o mais importante, em se falando de pre?o, d preferncia para aquelas que tem o zoom ptico maior (ex.: min. 12x). O zoom ptico faz a diferen?a em uma mquina dessas mais comuns que est?o no mercado. Outro fator interessante s?o aquelas que utilizam cart?o SD. D preferncia para aquela que tem maior tamanho de memria interna e que aceita um cart?o de pelo menos 2Gb. Ent?o a que tiver pelo menos zoom 12x, maior memria e aceitar cart?o de pelo menos 2Gb, com melhor pre?o, ser uma boa compra.|`|M10g3lspaa	Recomenda??es de um amador : ESCOLHA SUA C?MERA COM SABEDORIA  Dentre as Compactas (O maior destaque  por conta da portabilidade) : Canon PowerShot SD850 IS/Digital IXUS 950 IS,Canon PowerShot SD800IS/Digital IXUS 850 IS e Canon PowerShot A710 IS e Fujifilm Finepix F50fd .  Das DSRL (Digital Single-lens Reflex - Grande qualidade nas fotos, mesmo em ambiente com pouca luz. Op??o para flash externo. Velocidade de disparo maior. Menor tempo entre os disparos. Alta capacidade de tirar fotos continuamente. Velocidade no autofoco. N?o filmam. S?o grandes, Altssimo custo com lentes.) : Canon EOS 400D/Digital Rebel XTi e Canon EOS 350D/Digital Rebel XT.   E das SLR-like (s?o cameras em que a imagem captada pela lente sensibiliza o sensor (ou filme) e  mostrada no visor ptico, atravs de um conjunto de espelhos, ao contrrio das cameras de visor direto em que a imagem observada pelo visor ptico n?o  a mesma captada pela lente.    Existem cameras SLR de lentes fixas e de lentes intercambiveis, embora as mais comuns e conhecidas sejam as de lentes intercambiveis. Ent?o SLR acabou se tornando sin?nimo de cameras com lentes intercambiveis (apesar de n?o ter necessariamente esse recurso).  As cameras SLR s?o as popularmente conhecidas como "profissionais", como a linha F da Nikon (F5, F100), e a linha EOS da Canon.  Como deve ter visto as empresas aproveitaram o corpo e as lentes de cameras SLR convencionais e disponibilizaram cameras SLR digitais,.Dividem-se em Prosumer e SuperZoom :  Prosumer: Um pouco menor que as DSLR, filmam. Autofoco rpido. Algumas tem op??o para flash externo. Se saem bem em ambiente pouco iluminado, ms n?o tanto quanto as DSLR. SuperZoom: Mesmo sensor das compactas, com alguns recursos a mais, como controle manual da abertura e velocidade do obturador, prioridade para abertura, prioridade para velocidade, que voc encontras nas categorias superiores.) : Canon Powershot S5is ,Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ18 ,Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8 ,Fujifilm FinePix S8000 fd e Sony DSC-H9.     1o - O barato sai caro.N?o compre gato por lebre.Qualidade e tradi??o s?o importantes;Cuidado com as propagandas enganosas(Multilaser, Mirage, Tekpix, Genius, Vivitar, Sakar-iConcepts,Pentax,etc... );  2o - Valorize a qualidade da lente da camera;( Carl Zeiss, Leica, Scheineder e da Canon)  3o - A Camera deve ter estabilizador ptico de imagem;  4o - Tamanho do sensor no mx. 1/2.5 "  CCD (Charged Coupled Device)  o dispositivo mais importante de uma camera digital, responsvel pela transforma??o da luz em sinais eltricos.

Abertura da lente : Quanto menor o valor de abertura maior  o campo de largura que a lente vai cobrir. No caso de F2.7, seu campo de abertura ser maior. Para exemplificar, imagine uma sala cheia de gente lado a lado e vc batendo a foto. Essa abertura permite captar todo mundo mesmo estando numa curta distancia pois a abertura da lente  bem larga.  O Wide significa "largo", para os lados e o Tele significa estreito, porm profundo ,para frente No wide vc n?o utiliza zoom, no Tele  quando o zoom est acionado. Repare que o menor valor de Tele  maior do que o menor valor de Wide - de 3.5 para 2.8. Assim, 3.5  um campo de imagem mais estreito. Da, ao acionar o zoom ptico voc joga a lente para frente e conseqentemente diminui a largura da campo de vis?o da lente.  O wide tambm  utilizado nas cameras profissionais pra tirar fotos de paisagens e existem lentes especiais tanto de Wide como de Tele visando maior largura ou profundidade nas fotos.   Quais cameras digitais tem grande angular(abertura) F/1.8 ou F/2?A maioria tem F/2,8      Estes nmeros n?o s?o do angulo da lente e sim a abertura mxima do diafragma. Por exemplo com uma lente 1.8 pode-se fotografar com menos luz que uma 2.8.  O angulo de abertura  dado em milmetros.  As lentes consideradas grande angular geralmente s?o as de menos de 35mm ou 28mm.    As objetivas de abertura varivel n?o possuem a mesma luminosidade em toda a faixa do zoom. Isto permite que as objetivas sejam menores e mais baratas. Neste caso, esta objetiva tem a faixa de aberturas de 2.7 a 8.0 quando estiver no extremo de grande angular (Wide)e de 3.5 a 8.0 quando estiver sendo utilizado como Tele objetiva. Lembrem-se que quanto menor o numero f (2.7 neste caso), mais luminosa  a objetiva. N?o confundam o angulo de vis?o, que  relacionado com a distancia focal (18 a 70mm) com a luminosidade (2.7 ou 3.5)  Este no  fracionrio, ou seja 1/x. Ent?o F2.7  maior queF3.5. Wide Quer dizer , Grande Angular. ( Cabe mais assunto dentro da Foto)Porm poderia ser F2.7 sem ser Wide.  Os Nmeros F2.7e F3.5 tem rela??o com abertura do diafragma. Quanto maior abertura maior ilumina??

You can either transfer them with a Memory Unit or just Recover your gamertag on the other Xbox (if it has an internet connection)  and download them again from your Download History.    The Bad Part: You will have to be online with the original gamertag so the premium content can be used on the second console.    If you want to use it offline or with another gamertag, you can try to use the License Transfer tool in Xbox.com but of course it will affect the first license,  the one in the original console.|`|qbFE2c8raa	change hard drives

JUC8E03taa	You can't put music directly from iTunes into another mp3 player because the file format that iTunes uses is not compatible with players other than iPods. You would need to get the music files converted into a compatible file type in order to add it to the mp3 player. There are a couple of ways you can do this - you can burn the music onto a CD using iTunes and then import it into a program such as Windows Media Player that is compatible with mp3 players or you can download a conversion program from the internet that will take the iTunes format (m4a) and convert it to mp3 format.|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	if you want to download music to ipod all you can do is sync from itunes after getting music downloaded from your preferred site i prefer walmart.com it downloads to itunes and win media player if you want to sync a regular non apple brand mp3 player then you can go to media player and sync that way but i dont know if you are able to sync a regular mp3 via itunes|`|u13dNQz5aa	Itunes does  not hold music, the music is on your PC already all itunes does is creates a library of the songs you have<br>  <br>  Any itunes music would be in my music folder under itunes and the rest of your music would be where ever you saved it to.<br>  <br>  if you want to sync a normal MP3 player use Windows Media Player|`|xTNaKNOcaa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player.

0AqkCOWIaa	The Canon 5d is the better choice, and it comes with an L lens. Canon's L lenses are professionally built both optically and in build quality, and come with Canon's USM focusing motor. Canon's L lenses are great. ( Nikon makes L-Equivalent lenses too, but you won't be able to afford them after buying the D90's body ).  <br>  <br>  If you want video, get a camcorder. <br>  <br>  The full frame sensor is more important for your photography, which is the main reason for buying a digital SLR in the first place, right? You do not need live view, or the ability to record video. The 5d Is Much better. The 5d will feel more professional by far in your hand, but that is to be expected seeing as the D90 is just an entry-level mid-range camera. Also, the 5d is a few hundred grams heavier, and doesn't come with a built in flash unit, but one can easily be purchased on the side.<br>  <br>  If i were you, i would get the 5d hands down. <br>  <br>  Do not listen to others with Biased preferences.<br>  <br>  ***Fhotoace***<br>  <br>  I would see that as a biased-opinion. The 5d is a better camera, and it's in good condition with an L grade lens, and it comes with a full-framed sensor. Yes, i agree, it is an old camera, but i think it's still better than the D90. I am not battling you opinion ( and won't give you a thumbs down! ) but i am curious as to why you think the D90 is better here. The 5d is a more professional-oriented camera.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The Nikon is the newest under $1000 DSLR and here is a link that will tell you more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d90.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d90.htm</a><br>  <br>  The glass you buy for your camera is up to you, although both Nikon and Canon make excellent lenses.<br>  <br>  Whether your images are excellent or not, is up to you.  The camera you choose is just a tool ... you are the craftsman.|`|AA11539218	I agree with the above answer, the 5D is by far the better camera...even being 4 years old it will still take better looking shots than the D90. the D90 with live view and video is just a way to get people to buy it, but real photographers always use the view finder anyway, it is a lot more reliable and easier to frame the shot.<br>  <br>  And besides the 5D retails for the body alone at nearly $3000 so if you can get the body with a lens for under $2000 that is a good deal.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would recommend Nikon D90,newest model with great features.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fp%26field-keywords%3Dd90%26url%3Dnode%253D502394%252C281052%252C3017941&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>
vcSAAWn7aa	Yes, I think you should buy it. I'm buying it. My dad gave me a choice $200.00 or the Flip Mino. Of course I picked the $200.00 but The Flip Mino is less then that so I'm going to buy it and keep the rest of the money.     It has rechargable batteries and Its smaller than the Flip Ultra.  For some reason its not in stores yet. I dont know why.|`|hn3Q4vJYaa	you can read the comment of user from here.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...

5pxgdXXFaa	This has happened to me twice now. If you have tried the reset button with the paperclip and it still didn't work like mine then do what I did. Let the battery die (it may take two or so days depending on charge levels) once it dies plug it back into the ps3 via the usb cable. Let it sit for a few minutes to get some charge into it. During this time you should boot up the ps3 manually if it wasn't already. Then just push the PS button as normal. It should assign properly to the first available controller port.|`|RtptQqkXaa	Usually what i do is i put the USB cable in the USB port and insert it into the controller, and wait a second and it should re-appear as player 1.<br>  But really when your going to turn off the system you should hold in the PS button and click 'turn off system'. then wait and both the PS3 and controller will go off.<br>  Hope it helps|`|88MRgFPtaa	My controller is screwed too, it turns the ps3 on by itself. try finding a paper clip or maybe a thumbtack and reseting the controller by pushing the little rest button on the back. Note that you will have to re assign the controller to the ps3.

C1c8nPotaa	A. Try to connect your iPod with another computer with the iPod updater pre-installed.<br>  <br>  B. Still can’t see your iPod, put it in Disk Mode and connect with a computer, instead of doing a Restore on iPod Updater. Go and format the iPod instead.<br>  <br>  For Mac computer <br>  1. Open the disk utility, hope your iPod appears there (left hand side), highlight it <br>  2. Go to Tab “Partition”, click either “Delete” or “Partition”, if fails, skip this step and go to 3 <br>  3. Go to Tab “Erase” , choose Volume Format as “MAC OS Extended (Journaled), and click Erase, again if fails, skip it and go to 4 <br>  4. Same as step 3, but open the “Security Options....” and choose “Zero Out Data” before click Erase. It will take 1 to 2 hours to complete. <br>  5. Eject your iPod and do a Reset <br>  6. Open the iPod Updater and click “Restore”<br>  <br>  For Window computer <br>  Go to folder “My Computer” <br>  Hope you can see your iPod there and right click on the iPod <br>  Choose “Format”. Ensure the settings are at “Default” and that “Quick Format” is not checked <br>  Now select “Format” <br>  Eject your iPod and do a Reset <br>  Open the iPod Updater and click “Restore”<br>  In case you do not manage to do a “Format” on a window computer, try to use some 3rd party disk utility software, e.g.“Partition Magic”.<br>  <br>  C. Windows users having trouble with their iPods should locate a Mac user. In many cases when an iPod won't show up on a PC that it will show up on the Mac. Then it can be restored. When the PC user returns to his computer the iPod will be recognized by the PC, reformatted for the PC, and usable again. By the way, it works in reverse too. A Mac user often can get his iPod back by connecting it to a PC and restoring it.<br>  Tips<br>  a. It does not matter whether the format is completed or not, the key is to erase (or partly) the corrupted firmware files on the Hard Drive of the iPod. After that, when the iPod re-connected with a computer, it will be recognized as an fresh external hard drive, it will show up on the iPod updater. <br>  b. It is not a difficult issue for a Mac user to find a window base computer, for a PC user, if they can’t find any Mac user, they can go to a nearest Apple Shop for a favor.<br>  c. You may need to switch around the PC and Mac, try to do several attempts between “Format” and “Restore”<br>  <br>  D. Format your iPod with a start disk<br>  I have not tried this solution myself, I heard that there were few successful cases that the users managed to get their iPod (you must put your iPod in disk mode before connecting with a computer) mounted by the computer, which was booted by a system startup disk. For Mac, you can use the Disk Utility (on the Tiger OS system disk), for PC user, you can use the window OS system disk. Try to find a way to reformat your iPod, again it does not matter which format (FAT32, NTFS or HFS+) you choose, the key is to erase the corrupted system files on the iPod. Then eject your iPod and do a Reset to switch out from Disk Mode. Reboot your computer at the normal way, connect your iPod back with it, open the iPod updater, and hopefully your iPod will appear there for the Restore.|`|0rpN2419aa	Mine did that too.  I thought it was defective and we called the store where we bought it...and came here for help.  We plugged it into a different ubs port on the computer, and then touched the top button and the center button at the bottom at the same time.  It came on as it should and then I down loaded all my apps...The instructions that came with it are worthless.  You can also go to the Apple website and they have answers there.  Good luck.  I know you are going to love it!<br>  <br>  I have the touch second generation and LOVE it.  The games are so much fun and being able to listen to tunes someone else in this house doesn't like is an asset...LOL.  I love music and some that he doesn't.

If none of this works, your ps3 is defective and you should seek service.<br>  <br>  **What I mean is, say your ps3 is connected to "video 1".

PfMCsNoBaa	Brothers in arms hells highway is a tactical shooting game. You actually have to use your squad if you want to live. What you will mainly do in this game is you order one of your squads to provide suppressing fire onto the enemy while you try to flank them on your own or you use your other squad to do it.     If you only like run and gun games like call of duty then your probably not going to like this one. Also there's a demo for it so dl and try it out.    |`|7XYNveAraa	I have Brothers in arms hells highway. Its a satisfying tactical shooter, a gripping storyline and stunning graphics.

The release of this new service is still expected for release some time in the fall.  |`|enEpYylaaa	oh, the bungie thing is on maintnance, try it today it might work now, add me as ur friend, my gamertag is    ISAI14 ok.|`|4c1nn6hAaa	The xbox live people are updating the server. Wait for a day or two. Then, go on xbox live. Don't worry. This happened to me last year. At that time, like 30 people put up the same question on yahoo answers|`|lSnu59UJaa	Everyone who uses xbox live is getting the same problem at the moment. (including me).     It is coming up with "MTU failed". This is due to the new xbox Dashboard update coming out    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VExbd1oZ76...     It looks quite cool.     update is for 24 hours. You have 8 or 7 hours left to wait. Time to do some single play I think :P|`|cKM31h1faa	Live is down until tomorrow or late tonight.      Don't fret... they are doing server maintenance and updates.    Spread the word and answer other questions like this. I can't do it alone Lol.|`|rvBBwdr2aa	Xbox live is offline today until 11:59 PST so that is the problem that you are encountering because nobody can get on live until the maintenance for the New Xbox Dashboard is over. That is all it is  not a connection issue with your internet you just simply cannot get on until they finish
nQBSAbPGaa	Today is September 29, which can only mean one thing, yes Xbox Live is down for maintenance. This downtime is expected to last for 24 hours, so dont try and get on any time soon.

4ftSYnxnaa	I have a PS3 but my friend has an Xbox and what sucks about it is that you can't go online, you can download music pictures and videos like PS3. The PS3 has a bigger hard drive with 80 gigabyte. Xbox has weak drive that is slow. Ps3 has blue ray which is a disc that can store 4x more than a regular DvD disc and game disc. Though its expensive, you should get a Ps3 for investment because its new in the market. |`|aizHrqRtaa	All hardware problems!  1. The fans, both from the console AND the power brick, are extremely noisy.  2. It failed twice on me with 3-flashing-red-light in 1.5 years  3. The DVD drive tray will not eject sometimes    That's all...everything else is good.  I like the XBOX 360 controller better than PS3's DUALSHOCK 3|`|roPEuHaHaa	It's Microsoft EWWW  Nintendo is wayyy better.......|`|Vp9ZAeqpaa	i honestly hate this damn update process, they always do this and its always down for a looong time. this time they projected a 24 hour downtime, well see if that stands true....|`|MhR1kU8naa	Nothing its the best console out there for me.|`|p0prrzf2aa	it doesn't fit my flat screen TV right|`|6Svqb2xAaa	my husband spends half his life playing it HA|`|166062537f8266290ed1b5cf931f96a1aa	the power thing is HUGE and takes up to much energy. and then the wireless controllers suck butt. |`|KSTRavj5aa	the red rings but they fixed that in the new 65nm chip set.  Also its the best video game console ever.|`|5HPkIxZHaa	it costs money to play online. i hate that!! that 1 of the main reasons that make ps3 better|`|7tYWqmZnaa	PS3 fan boys.|`|6df59327f57b41a27a78d74597e42ab8aa	Uhm, its an amazing system...    Ask what I hate about the PS3, then we have an argument.|`|q0yMb9Hlaa	The thing i hate the most is sometimes if and when you play a game so much, it scratches your disk and the disk doesn't work anymore|`|rvBBwdr2aa	Agree and the RROD sucks and some of the games suck and controller lag sucks alot sucks but alot is also good you have to balance out the positives and the negatives|`|EW7kRrWxaa	WOW FIRST POST OOK IT UNDERTSNAIND TO BE MAD about energy but come on  wirless controller sucks please  you FAIL    but really not much bothers me i dont complain about paying for online because i think its will worth it    the rrod is fine as fine but kind of dread it but i rather play somethinmg for while  and enjoy what i do and if it dose break i can take a 2 week break       but 4real nothi bothers me i love my xbox  |`|xsprvlL3aa	not sure if it counts, but when i play on live, it gets slow, and doesn't seem to keep up with the games.  |`|1TiA6zbtaa	It does not have bluray like another platform, and it always seems to be lagging behind in the games department. It could do with a larger variety of games. Lastly, it could do with being a bit smaller as well as having a quieter fan installed - I always have to turn the volume up when I turn my xbox 360  on.
Zdyd7rYtaa	They had the servers down yesterday to get it ready for the update in November.|`|7tYWqmZnaa	The update wasn't for the console, it was for the servers. Everyone at Microsoft said the NXE come out later in the year. Almost everyone here said the same thing.|`|AA10950302	Xbox Live was down yesterday for maintenance in preparation for the new Xbox Live Experience update scheduled for November.|`|bD7j0pyaaa	same here i stayed up till 2 (on a skool night) waitin for it|`|iZRWwQo9aa	Xbox 360 update doesn't have an official announce date. People are just guessing. Expect it late October (28+, because microsoft releases a game that was made for the Avatar feature), or early-mid November.     This was for maintenance and preparation for the Update.|`|rvBBwdr2aa	Actually the second week of october looks about right before big games so then we can get the big games and the new dashboard

OzmHAbgUaa	Not all of the games are backward compatible check the list in the link for what is supported|`|Ai4kGM1Oaa	Some, because the 360 has to emulate an Xbox, they have to spend time making each game compatible with it.|`|mRCiMSHyaa	yes, but you need a hard drive|`|7XYNveAraa	Yes they are compatible|`|eLhEmBIuaa	Yes, but you have to either have a 20 or a 120 gigabyte certified Xbox 360 hard drive, if you have the Arcade version your xbox 360 will come with an update for you to play xbox originals on your xbox 360, if it doesn't you can download the update and copy it to a CD to copy it to your xbox 360.  Have fun playing Xbox Originals on your 360.|`|eEs2TYpuaa	some , but not all of them. sorry but i don't know wich ones u can|`|KuOcaHvVaa	Yep
