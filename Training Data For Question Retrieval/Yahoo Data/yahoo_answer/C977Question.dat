20090205191649AACg4lS	Sports;Other - Sports	I can't decide on which new bowling ball to get.?	okay so ive been bowling about 9 years and finally made my varsity bowling team this year (season actually just ended today) and i want a new bowling ball to practice with  all summer and use next season. right now i have an ebonite tornado and its just not hooking enough to my liking. i dont want a major hook but i dont want to have to throw a straight line at the pocket to get a strike (i dont have a high rev rate either and the lanes i bowl on are medium to high oil so im not getting any movement out of my tornado). i was thinking ebonite playmaker, brunswick swarm, storm virtual gravity, hammer anger raw, or black widow bite. any suggestions?

20090205171746AAhb30x	Sports;Cycling	How does training on the hardest difficulty with a stationary bike affect your body?	I often cycle on a stationary bike using a difficulty (around level 8-10) which I can ride at 40-50kph comfortably and can go over 65kph in short bursts. I can ride this way for at least an hour if i really push myself so you can see it isn't extremely difficult.      The other day, I decided to try going on max difficulty (which is level 16 on my bike) for a little while. My aim was to give everything I had for 30 seconds. For the first 20 seconds, I rode between 40 and 45kph. For the next 10 seconds, I cycled at over 45kph. I pushed myself to the absolute limit here and had to get off the bike immediately. Straight away, my legs tightened up and I could barely stand my legs felt that weak. I had a shower and once i got out (which was something like 20 minutes after I finished riding), my legs still felt really weak and I could barely climb the stairs.      This got me thinking..    If I can cycle at level 8 for 30-60 minutes, I can increase my fitness and aerobic endurance.    How does the body respond to cycling as fast as you can on the hardest difficulty for 30 seconds? Does this improve leg strength, or muscular endurance..??      Could someone please help me figure this out?   Thanks heaps in advance.

For a shotgun, I know a smooth bore is need for shot-shells, so that's why I came up with the question.      I have a .22 wmr henry lever action, and I would just like to know if it is perfectly safe for the barrel to shoot shot shells? I have the .22 mag cci brand (wmr)      People say its perfectly fine for the barrel and that it is made for that, but I am not sure if they probably got the impression that I had a smooth bore similar to a shotgun.      My henry rifle is just a normal .22 mag, stocks, just as I got it.
20090205175456AA62ygK	Sports;Basketball	How to become a point guard?	My high school basketball coach told me that I'm going to be running the point from now on, but I've never been a point guard before, mostly a shooting guard/forward. I've been turning the ball over in recent games, and I know that if I want the spot, I need to work on not turning the ball over. I also need to know: how can I increase my handling/dribbling skills? My right is good, but my left is weak. Also: how can I get better at layups? I know these are a lot of questions, and your time is appreciated. Thanks.

20090205192111AA7qHAo	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Comment on this statement.?	A beginning gunsmith really only needs good hand tools and a very good drill press with a compound table. As you advance, you can still do almost everything with hand tools and attachments, probably adding a grinder and sander as you progress, as well as dremels and other power hand tools and drill press attachments. The very advanced shop you see in pictures that includes two or three precision Lathes, milling machines (both horizontal and vertical), drill sharpener, engraving machines and lasers, saws including band/table, shapers, tool and cutting grinders, blueing stations, etc. usually means that a lot of the machines go unused, because the art of making precision tools has been replaced to a large extent by the low cost of Chinese tools that are cheaper to buy and toss than make yourself.” Keep your comment technical, not political!

He is a Legend. He is one of my all-time favorite Wrestlers.      Masked Kane was awesome, but so is Unmasked Kane.   To me, his mask is just a prop. Props DON'T make the Wrestler. Talent does. I think as time went on, Kane just got better and better.       I keep hearing, Kane is nothing without the mask. I do not get why people say that, because it's far from true. I understand he had a more intimidating character with the mask, but he is still very intimidating. The mask didn't Wrestle for him, it didn't talk on the mic for him. Kane did that. Not his mask. I feel like people don't like him because his mask is gone. I feel like he is very underrated because of this. I've even read a question recently that said, he should be released. I just don't understand all of this hate on Kane. He is an amazing WWE Superstar with and without the mask. Like I said, as time went by he only got better and better.       WQ1: Masked Kane or Unmasked Kane and WHY?      WQ2: So I ask, why do people dislike Kane now that his mask is gone? Nothing has changed. Well, something has changed. He keeps getting better and better.

20090205192854AAVS9qH	Sports;Wrestling	Rate My Wrestlemania 25 Predictions?	Money In The Bank Match:    Evan Bourne vs Mr. Kennedy vs CM Punk vs Shelton Benjamin vs Gregory Helms vs The Brian Kendrick            Rey Mysterio vs Mike Knox:    After attacking Mysterio week after week, and probably in the Elimination Chamber. It doesn't take alot of brains to see this match at Wrestlemania. Although it may be a dark match.            Trish Stratus vs Natalya   WWE has been nearly begging Trish to have another match at this years Wrestlemania. And even though she could have rather faced Beth Phoenix (which would make more sense and I'll be getting too after) I myself think Natalya is a possible opponent for her. Trish even said her black and pink wrestling attire and Canada aren't just a coincidence. Out of respect for her and the Hart family, this match could happen.            Beth Phoenix vs Rosa Mendez:   This is turning into the old storyline a few years back. The psycho fan (Mickie James) and her idol (Trish Stratus). And it really doesn't take alot of thought to figure that out.   On RAW last Monday, Jerry said that Santino only got one piece of Fan mail? Was it. Something like that. Could it be Rosa Mendez?  A few months back there were hints of Santino cheating on Beth, with the cell phone thing if you remember that short segment. Could that be Rosa Mendez also?   Santino cheats on Beth, Rosa becomes his new girlfriend and Beth Phoenix faces Rosa Mendez at Wrestlemania for some sort of 'revenge'            Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy:   We all know this match, or something related to it will happen. Does it really need an explanation?            Steve Austin vs Chris Jericho:   A week ago I wouldn't have said this could happen. But it looks as if Mickey Rourke has backed out of his Wrestlemania match, so where does that leave Jericho? Steve Austin, as far as I know still doesn't have an opponent for Wrestlemania either.    Even though Chris may have verbally ripped Flair to shreds last Monday, the chances of those two facing off is highly unlikely. It would completely ruin last years Shawn vs Flair match, with a Batista and Jericho storyline feeding off that outcome.             Triple H vs Kozlov:   With all these big matches coming together this year, where does it leave Hunter? This guy craves the spotlight, which pisses people off from time to time. I see him trying to make 'history' again and ending Kozlov's undefeated streak. (if you can even still call it undefeated)            Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker:    The match that I've been dreaming about since forever. This match will completely blow the roof off of the arena.   Currently, Undertaker is feudless. Shawn Michael's feud with JBL is coming to end at No Way Out. With Undertaker coming to raw for the night next week, I think we may see more then an Orton vs Undertaker match, and that WWE may start planting the seeds for Wrestlemania between these two.    My choice already for match of the year.            Tommy Dreamer vs Jack Swagger(c):   I overheard that Dreamer is threatening to walk away if WWE doesn't make him ECW champion anytime soon. I don't know if thats true, but it does make sense. Because he does deserve miles more respect then he's getting. Since Jack Swagger was just a test to see how he'll do, I see WWE 'taking' Dreamers threat to Wrestlemania.            Edge(c) vs Christian:    Another "Brother" vs "Brother" match, this time for the title.    I'm not sure how this will all come together, but honestly I didn't know where else to put Christian.             Randy Orton vs John Cena(c):   It almost looks as if WWE has changed positions. And that Randy has become WWE's new golden boy. Randy is getting tons, TONS of momentum, and has been the main character of raw for many weeks now. Where as John Cena barely gets 10 minutes of air time. Anyway, Randy won the rumble, going to wrestlemania to face the champ. I'm nearly certain Cena isn't losing the belt at No Way Out either.               Tell me what you think.

First of all, for all you Kobe haters, if he said tomorrow that he wanted to come to your team, you'd dump the BEST player on your team to get him. End of story.      Second, for all you that think Lebron James deserves to be in the conversation with Kobe, go get that screw driver and tighten the one in the back of your head. Kobe is the heir apparent, best in the game, 3 time NBA Finals champ. When the 4th quarter comes, give me Kobe. You can have Lebron. I don't want someone to choke away the game for me. I want a PROVEN winner.      Third, Spurs suck, Cavs suck, Celtics suck, Lebron James sucks. Thank you. Have a nice day.

Not to mention,  that they bought the winning   streak by the NFC  of Bowl wins to an abrupt end.  13 times in a row,   wow.  Then the AFC came to life after that.  But I still say that SUPER   BOWL 32 was the absolute best,  from front to back.  This game   had no dull moments.  It was a shootout,  and it had the same suspense that all of the others had,  as well as the drama with the   face mask controversy.  Just push rewind.  1998 a great year by the   way.

20090205204551AAQ6rjU	Sports;Basketball	After watching Lakers/Refs vs. Celtics do you think NBA Games are still fixed?	To put it lightly, this game was officiated by some very one-sided refs. When Garnett fouled out, that was by far the worst call I've seen all season. There were numerous others - too many to list. The non-call on Ray Allen on the final shot was equally bad.    Needless to say, it's pretty bad when the announcers utter things like:    "Are you serious? They're not going to call a foul there?"    "The ref should've called over the back on Odom but instead he signals Boston ball"    "Wow yeah Fisher does a good job of selling the non-foul on Garnett"    The C's played crappy and L.A. stunk from the foul line but even a blind man can see that the difference maker was the refs tonight.

I am 14 and live in the suburbs of chicago with my 17 year old girly sister and mom. i LOVE the outdoors and i havent gone camping in about 4 years. and when i did go it wasnt actually like camping by making shelters and stuff. it was like tents, and premade food, and there was other civilization around. I want to hike the appalachian trail or camp in Yosemite national par. my mom popped the question the other day, " so where do you want to go for vacation this summer"? i said alaska or camping in the two places i said earlier. my sister said florida( which we just went to last year, and the year before that new york). my mom said alaska was to expensive so i said how about the other two places but she never answered me. but she kept on talking about beaches, and cities, and those kinda places. i would 150% love camping, hiking or climbimg more. but living in a house full of two girls is hard to let me live my life the way i want. she just wont consider it very much because both of them dont want to. but what about me?!?

20090205212851AAM1DgQ	Sports;Martial Arts	Jeet Kune do questions?	What is the difference between JKD and JKDC if there is any?      Al ot of people say that in JD you take what works for you and discard what does not work for you.       Doesn't that mean you have to have back a back ground in martial arts? I mean you can't logically disregard a move you haven't trained in.      So isn't  JKD  more about a way to train different techniques form different arts to make what you have learned so far in to your own style by cross training.      Example: a person who has trained striking at one place and stand up grappling at another. He is not going to know how to change levels in to his own style and mix these and then get rid of what works for him and what does not. So he goes to a JKD place to learn how to do this and then share and learn from others.      Or is JKD a martial art that teaches you a certain moves that some one else told you are right and wrong for you?      This is honest curiosity, not bashing or other wise.

20060707185732AATNefj	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	A COPA de 98... Foi! E este ano foi também vendido? N?o duvido nada... Verdade? Ou N?o?	A COPA de 98, foi vendida, e a de 2006?...   Talvez, isso explique a raz?o do jogador Leonardo ter declarado a seguinte frase: "Se as pessoas soubessem o que aconteceu na Copa do Mundo, ficariam    enojadas".             Todos os brasileiros ficaram chocados e tristes por terem perdido a Copa do Mundo de futebol, na Fran?a. N?o deveriam. O que está exposto abaixo é a notícia em primeira m?o que está sendo investigada por rádios e jornais de todo o Brasil e alguns estrangeiros, mais especificamente Wall Street Journal of Americas e o Gazzeta delo Sport e deve sair na mídia em breve, assim que as provas forem colhidas e confirmarem os fatos.       Fato comprovado:       o Brasil VENDEU a copa do mundo para a Fifa. Os jogadores titulares brasileiros foram avisados, às 13:00 do dia 12 de Julho (dia do jogo final), em uma reuni?o envolvendo o Sr. Ricardo Teixeira (na única vez que o presidente da CBF compareceu a uma rele??o da sele??o), o Técnico Mário Zagallo, o Sr. Américo Faria, supervisor da sele??o, e o Sr. Ronald Rhovald, representante da patrocinadora Nike.       Os jogadores reservas permaneceram em isolamento, em seus quartos ou no lobby do hotel. A princípio muito contrariados, os jogadores se recusaram a trocar o penta-campeonato mundial por sediar a Copa do Mundo.             A aceita??o veio através do pagamento total dos prêmios, US$70.000,00 para cada jogador, mais um b?nus de US$ 400.000,00 para todos os jogadores e    integrantes da comiss?o, num total de US$ 23.000.000,00 vinte e três milh?es de dólares) através da empresa Nike.    Além disso, os jogadores que aceitarem o contrato com a empresa Nike nos próximos 4 anos ter?o as mesmas bases de prêmios que os jogadores de    elite da empresa, como o próprio Ronaldo, Raul da Espanha, Batistuta da Argentina e Roberto Carlos, também do Brasil.    Mesmo assim, Ronaldo se recusou a jogar, o que obrigou o técnico Zagallo a escalar o jogador Edmundo, dizendo que Ronaldo estava com problemas no    joelho esquerdo (em primeira notícia divulgada às 13:30 no centro de imprensa) e, logo depois, às 14:15, alterando o prognóstico para problemas estomacais). A sua situa??o só foi resolvida após o representante da Nike amea?ar retirar seu patrocínio vitalício ao jogador, avaliado em mais de US$90.000.000,00 (noventa milh?es de dólares) ao longo da sua carreira.    Assim, combinou-se que o Brasil seria derrotado durante o "Golden Goal" (prorroga??o com morte súbita), porém a apatia que se abateu sobre os jogadores titulares fez com que a Fran?a, que absolutamente n?o participou desta negocia??o, marcasse, em duas falhas simples do time brasileiro, os primeiros gols.    O Sr. Joseph Blatter, novo presidente da Fifa, cidad?o franco-suí?o, aplaudiu a colabora??o da equipe brasileira, uma vez que o campeonato    mundial trouxe equilíbrio à Fran?a num momento das mais altas taxas de desemprego jamais registradas naquele país, que ser?o agravadas pela recente    introdu??o do euro (moeda única européia) e o mercado comum europeu (ECC).    Garantiu, também, ao Sr. Ricardo Teixeira, através de seu tio, Jo?o Havelange, que o Brasil teria seu caminho facilitado para o penta-campeonato de 2002. Esta mensagem é para o maior número possível de pessoas, para que todos possam conhecer a sujeira que ronda o futebol!             Desde, já agrade?o, Um abra?o.
