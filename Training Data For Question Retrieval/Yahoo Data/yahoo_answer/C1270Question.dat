20090307150136AAQ86YA	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	A question for neonatal specialists regarding the US infant mortality rate?	I was reading something the other day and I'm wondering if it's true.  It was explained that the reason the US infant mortality rate is comparatively high, is due to the number of preterm infants being admitted to NICU facilities.  Meaning, since we have the technology to give preterm infants a chance at life, those births are recorded as live births.  Whereas in other countries without those facilities, they are recorded as stillbirths or miscarriages.      So, given that a certain percentage of babies in a NICU will unfortunately, not survive, that has an effect on the infant mortality rate.      It makes sense, but I've never heard this before.  Can anyone confirm whether this is true?

Im in integrated science and i have to make up my own planet, and it has to be 4 pages (yes 4, in a regular 9th grade class) D:  it has to have responsible information and such.   i know some details already on how im going to do this, it will be a terrestrial planet, close to earths atmosphere, but instead of appearing blue, it will be more purplish (exactly what would it take to make it purple though?) and the galaxy in is in is is another (what should i name it), not discovered till year 2759, what should it's sun be named, its a young Solar system and so is the planets and the star (their sun) so the planet "X" im creating is very young but may be able to hold a form of life one day because of ice crystals that are appearing there, kind of like earth's ancient times. im also not sure what to name it.      so yeah ideas to improve and (as mentioned) the atmosphere, how could it be purple? thinner or thicker atmosphere and what could the contents be for it? (carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc.)

I know this is all hypothetical, but what would it take to make a completely realistic virtual world? Like the kind in the movies and video games. Where the person inside can't even detect that what they're experiencing isn't real.

Then figure out someway to hook up motor output functions to the device so that it would appear that you could maneuver through the reality.      What else would it take? Any ideas?

NPV, IRR don’t seem applicable and most APY, AER formulas need a rate to calculate a rate.  I don’t have a square root calculator.

Pluto is a planet about the size of our moon with three moons of it's own in orbit.      Ceres is an asteroid about a tenth the size of Pluto in the asteroid belts with millions of other asteroids in orbit between Mars and Jupiter.      On August 26, 2006 the IAU in the same breath that they demoted Pluto promoted Ceres to equal status.      This is a grievious insult to the planet Pluto. At best Ceres should be given a lateral promotion to 'Honorary Planet'.

20090227081817AAHwrJ2	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Any personal paranormal experience to share? based on the truth pls?	During my study trip stay in a hotel in china- hangzhou, the first night, my partner was woke up by a loud noise which she claimed to sound like someone shaking a metal gate vigorously. She told me in the morning which i laughed it off and we even concluded that it came from the opened window which could be caused by the contact with the great impact of wind outside. We then remembered that when we first found our room, we realised that the bedroom beside ours is the only one empty out of the entire floor's room. We came as a study tours with over 30 students and all the room were occupied by us except that particular room. My partner and i were suspicious about it at first, we and knew that it is not occupied as the room is dark as we could not see from the little beam of light from underneath the door when we are about to check in to our room at night.       Duirng our second night of stay, i was the one who experienced somehting which is almost similar to what my friend had experience. I was awoke by a loud blast of noise which i would say simialr to that of a vacuum cleaner noise. I was very sure that it came from the dressing table side and that the noise definitely occur in our room. Then, i remembered what my partner had told me in the morning on what she had expeirenced in which got me scare and i immediately took the tv remote control to switch on the tv and maximise its volume. I did not dare to wake my partner up for fear that she could not hear me and that this could alert the paranormal stuff. After which i turned my entire body to face the other side, away from the dressing table direction and forced myself to sleep which i did luckily. And when i awoke, i thought i saw 2 transparent faces floating in the air while i was looking at the wall beside the bed.       After cleaning up, we went for breakfast and i told my lecturer including some frens about it. My lecturer was surprised and gave us a serious look when he asked if we would like to change our room. We looked at each other and then declined his offer. For the thrid night which is our final stay, we turned on every light there is in the room and slept soundly throughout the night.    What do you think? any story to share?

(5 / (x+7)) + (15 / (x+5))  /  (2x+13)  /  (x^2+12x+35)      The answer choices are: A) 1/10   B) 20   C) 10  D) 2x+13         But I got this answer: 10 / ((x+5)^2(x+7)^2)

20090307130437AAfGDLr	Science & Mathematics;Weather	How common would fog be in the following situation?	Okay, we've got a village. There's a very wide river flowing towards it from the north and at the northern tip of the village, the river splits and goes around it, joining together again at the southern tip of the village. So we've basically got a decent sized island with a village on it in the middle of a super wide river. Now, the sun is completely blocked out by clouds all the time, so darkness is everywhere and it's pretty chilly. So, would fog be common? If so how often and, if possible, how thick? Also, even without the river nearby, would there be a lot of fog everywhere else or none at all, because we're talking about a world completely blocked out from the sun?       That's the main part of my question. If you would, I'd also like to know the requirements/conditions for a good fog.      Thanks in advance.

"        http://www.spirit-lake.k12.ia.us/~jtirev...     it furthermore states that This chemical is readily biodegradable and is not likely to bioconcentrate what does this mean?   ANY information will be fully appreciated and will be cited into my bibliography as well as acknoledgements

20090307142618AAX1iP3	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chem homework problem about heat capacity...?	Hello everyone, I need help with two questions about heat capacity... here they are:      1. 30 mL of water at 48.9oC were mixed with 30 mL of water at 25.1oC in a calorimeter also at 25.1oC. The final temperature was 30.1oC. Assuming that neither the density of water nor its specific heat capacity change with temperature, calculate the total heat capacity of the calorimeter (density of water = 1.00g mL^-1, specific heat capacity = 4.18 J g^-1 K^-1)      2. When 6.50 g of NaOH(s) are added to 100 g of water (using the same calorimeter from 1), the temperature rises from 25 to 39oC. Calculate the molar heat of solution. (assume that the specific heat of water is 4.18 J g^-1 K-1 and that of the NaOH soulution is the same.      Thank you soooooo much for your help!

20090307144421AAxc3jR	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Ghosts? Paranormal activity? What do you think?	Okay, well about 3 months ago my hubby and I moved into a house that my grandparents gave me as a wedding gift. On the deed it says the house was built in 1880. The woman that used to live in this home lived to be 106, in 2004 she was sent to a nursing home and passed away about 2006. Well all of her things were left in the house, the family didn't bother getting it out before they sold the house I guess. Well, when we moved into the house it was AMAZING it was like you walked into a time portal, EVERYTHING was antique right down the the carpet. The house is a one story house, at one time it was 3 storys. IDK much else about the house.. About 3 weeks ago I started hearing what sounded like someone knocking on the wall the the room next to mine.. When we moved in, in the room next to mine was a hospital bed, which my grandma told me she thinks the womans mother died on. (oh yeah, forgot to mention theres a headstone in the back yard dated 1832-1904) Sometimes at night when I'm walking around the house I'll see in the corner of my eye a black figure walking beside me, when I stop, it stops, when I walk, it walks.. When I go to look at it it disappears.. WELL last night the same thing happened to me, well this time when I looked, it stayed, for like half a second and it didn't just disappear it DARTED away into the dark.. It was just a black mass.. When I went and got into bed, I started heard like, stomping in the attic.. Not really loud like trying to make noise stomping, like angrily pacing or something.. No one believes me about any of it, thought the other night my hubby heard the knocking on the wall, but he thinks its just the house settling..Has anyone had anything like this happen to them before?

So, what I tried to do was convert those 0.787 torr into atm, getting a very small number and then dividing that by the gas law constant (0.08206) and the temp in K (35+273). I knew molarity was mol/L and there was only 1 L so i just made it moles. I'm not sure if what i did from there was right so can someone show work on how to actually do this? Here's the question:         An aqueous solution of 10.00 g of an enzyme has a volume of 1.00 L at 35°C. The solution's osmotic pressure at 35°C is found to be 0.787 torr.

Answers before and I am still trying to figure it out completely. I only halfway understand it.      So, I think the formula for this is P(x=k) = (nCk)p^k (1-p)^(n-k). If you have a process that consists of 11 trials with a probability of success of 0.3, then:      a) To find the probability of obtaining exactly 5 successes, you would do:   ?? What is the C in (nCk) stand for?      P(X=5) = (11C5)(0.3)^5(0.7)^6= ? because I do not know what the C means      b) Find the probability of obtaining at least 8 successes.   So... P(X=8) + P(X=9) +P (X=10) + P(X=11), tells me what?       c) Find the probability of obtaining at most 3 successes?   P(X=0) + P(X=1) +P(X=2) + P(X=3)       Does P = 0.3 and n = 11?

20090307153931AAXgLHi	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Did anyone see a UFO sighting in Plano, Texas on Janurary 17,2009?	I was driving home on 1-17-09, going north on the tollway and saw a ufo really low to the ground above Tinsel Town movie theater. It was about 10:12-10:15 at night. I did not report it would like to know if anyone else saw anything similiar. My first thought was why is this air plane so close to the ground, but then it shifted in a way that showed it was comletely round with big white lights, just hovering over the theater. I would really like to know if anyone else saw something similar.

20090307155035AAzh54j	Science & Mathematics;Biology	BIOLOGY!!!!*please help*?	Multiple choice-answer the one you know for sure please n thank you dont answer all if you dont know it at least one helps:)      1)Given a population that contains genetic variation, what is the correct sequence of the following events, under the influence of natural selection?   1. differential reproduction occurs.   2. a new selective pressure arises.   3. Allele frequencies within the population change.   4. poorly adapted individuals have decreased survivorship      2) To observe natural selection's effects on a population, what must be true?   a. one must observe more than one generation of the population    b. the population must contain genetic variation    c. members of the population must increase or decrease the use of some portion of their anatomy   d. A and C only   e. A and B ony      3) in hypothetical environment, fishes called pike-cichlids are visual predators of algae-eating fish, i.e., they locate their prey by sight. If a population of algae eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following would least likely be observed in the algae-eater population over the course of many generations?   a. coloration of the algae eaters may become drab   b. the algae eaters may become nocturnal ( active only at night).   c. female algae eaters may become larger, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young.   d. the algae eaters may become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.    e. the algae eaters may become faster swimmers.      4) A biologist studied a population of squirrels for 15 years. During that time, the population was never fewer than 30 squirrels and never more than 45. Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born live to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. What interferences might you make about this population?    a. the amount of available food may have increased   b. the number of predators may have decreased.   c. the squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of variation than previous generations because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.   d. a and b only   e. a, b, and c      5) which of the following is the best example of humans undergoing evolution, understood as "descent with modification"?   a. reduction in the amount and coarseness of body hair over millennia   b. reduction in numbers of hairs on the head of a balding person   c. increased pigment production by the skin of a person who is exposed to increased UV radiation lights   d. increase in weight over an individual's lifetime   e. widening of the pupils of the eyes when one encounters dimly lit conditions.      6) Which statement best describes how the evolution of pesticide resistance occurs in a population of insects?    a. individual members of the population slowly adapt to the presence of the chemical by striving to meet the new challenge.   b. all insects exposed to the insecticide begin to use a formerly silent gene to make a new enzyme that breaks down the insecticide molecules.   c. insects observe the behavior of other insects that survive pesticide application, and adjust their own behaviors to copy those of the survivors.    d. a number of genetically resistant pesticide survivors reproduce. The next generation of insects contains more genes from the survivors than it does from susceptible individuals.   e. b and d only
