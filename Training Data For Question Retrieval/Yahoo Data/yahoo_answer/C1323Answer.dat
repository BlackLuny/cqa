AA10053661	Society isn't......and don't we dictate the need?     We get one thing.....and immediately come up with ideas about how to make it new and improved. As long as we are not patient and kind, progress will have to try to keep up with the need and demand.     And don't we run many risks with this type of mentality? Will the "new and improved" be a "quick fix" that is not really progress at all, but a masked production of something that thrown together to appease the demand. Something that will break down. Falter. And in a sense.......actually push back progress by three steps.     Progress should be patient. It should be slow......logical ....deliberate. It can't be pushed until its  time has come. Until it is ready. Until it is proven. Until it truly is progress.... ready to move forward.     People are impatient. Progress should not be.|`|3b71e1c4babff33e511fe572605e1a1faa	No.    Things happen whether you're ready for them or not.    It doesn't wait...    Sort of like a blessing/curse.|`|8eafd1a3904ea19163c8200e1eb535ceaa	no. the society's progress, especially technology, is at an accelerating rate, not a constant rate. thus we are experiencing changes faster than even before.|`|af672821cfc5930758dd2d1a88459f17aa	The question is really not "progress".  Progress is the result of change, adaptation, and development. All progress is controlled and led by needs of society, science and curiosity. None of which are patient. A good thing too. Patience is the mother of stagnation. Impatience is the mother of invention. Ok, so is necessity, but in many ways the same thing.|`|AA10881140	The follow two quotes came to mind. Both from Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) in Jurassic Park.    "Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."       "I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here: it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew what you had you patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you're selling it, you want to sell it!"    That pretty much sums up my feelings toward gratuitous "progress" in the name of the bottom line.      So I don't know if progress is patient but I can be pretty impatient when it comes to what convetional wisdom considers progress.|`|AA11828944	yes|`|cdde12754b6fd29e3ae8348fc815050faa	No, but something's got to give.

VJcypcIhaa	Get a psychologist or a counselor to pay attention to you. There are actual conditions where you NEED attention. They could help you work with it much more than any random person on the internet.    In the meantime, though, take time to stop and think. Before you react in a silly way that will embarrass you later, ask "Why do I want to do that?" or maybe "What would be a better way to react?"|`|1re8d9kCaa	i feel ya...i do the same thing...i cut myself for attention...i never got the attention i wanted from it tho...my parents never gave me anymore attention cuz they never saw the cuts even tho i wear them on my wrist and never tried to hide it from anyone...i dont screw around with boys tho cept my ex bf...i make up things all the time tho...im a hypochondriac and i cant stop thinking i have a lot of illnesses even tho only one of them have been confirmed...i really dont know how to help you cuz i need help to...i just wanted to let ya know that you're not the only one out there who feels this way|`|hsMxATecaa	at least youre not emo|`|N4A3pKStaa	You don't need attention.

gMvTpgVaaa	As in all species, females do the attracting, males do the impressing.    Men have to impress women with flashy cars, expensive gifts, fat wallets, wild vacations, etc.    the males of other species are attracted to a woman's scent, which is put out when in heat.  Since human females don't exude a scent which attracts men, they have to resort to the visual to ATTRACT - not impress.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	IDK...several mammal species have physical signs that they are ready to breed.

Well probably because men have much more power in our society and much of are way of life is considered unnatural compared to the natural way of other animals... But I would also think that a certain animal with less commitment for females might have more of a chance for a female to be have to impress.|`|u1vEj8DYaa	There are plenty of bird species who are not sexually dimorphic (we humans are sexually dimorphic).  Male and female birds are identical in appearance but they engage in ritualistic mating behavior.  Humans do this too.|`|tTIXhe7daa	You need to stop talking period|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I think there are some monkey groups that engage in flirtation type behavior.|`|mCAWxobNaa	I respectfully beg to differ with the premise of your question.  Although it is true that in H. sapiens ladies wear makeup, do "radical" things such as engage in aesthetic surgery to enhance their appearance, perception of their own appearance or the likelihood of finding more FIT partners, courting and mating behaviour in any number of zoologic species (not simply limited to class mammalia) demonstrates that females go to great lengths to attract males.  You can simply examing the courtship rituals of the Norway rat for examples of this, including but not limited to the frequency and subtleties of lordotic posturing (only some of which do we understand).  Clearly such a display is not only uncomfortable for the rat but may potentially be dangerous.  Granted, rats don'g get plastic surgery since there is a relatively small number of accredited plastic sugery fellowships for rats that are presently recognized.    Nontheless, there are some distinct differences between H. sapiens and other animals.  First one must consider the difference in our neocortex.  Then one must understand that courting and mating behaviour is very complex to study and we have only limited insight into it.  Despite this, I can assure you that survival of the fittest entails that both genders of a given species must do their best to appear as desirable as possible to increase the likelihood of passing on their genetic substrate.  Even in H. sapiens, a woman who appears emaciated will have trouble finding mates as this would likely endanger the well-being of the foetus.  Women who starve themselves are not regarded as reproductively fit by most men and hence this is not a good strategy for attracting suitable partners.    *******  ADDENDUM:  Miss, please do not sit on me as I did not suggest that you are a lesbian or that you have a heavy buttocks, rather I simply tried my best to answer the question.  There was nothing in my answer which remotely was intended to disparage you, so please do not sit on my head.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Good point.

Couldn't be happier about it     ** Top Consipracy's answer totally made me wish I'd thought of it. That sounds pretty stellar to me actually.|`|oCHaJc49aa	Ho ho ho hee hee hee, har har har hee hee...darlin' you seriously think girls "dress up" to impress GUYS?    Pardon me while I roll on the floor laughing.    C'mon, how OFTEN do we hear women (Feminists and otherwise) complain LONG and BITTERLY that "guys don't notice............." and here you can say "the new dress" or "the new hair-style" or "the new shoes".    How OFTEN do the Feminists have to confirm what I'm saying by complaining that guys only wanted to see them naked? Mind you, *I* would not want to see a Feminist naked....brrrrrrrrrr (shiver, shudder)...make the average man celibate for life.    Females are encouraged to wear ridiculous shoes, nutty make-up and starve themselves BY THEIR CLUELESS COMPETITIVENESS with OTHER FEMALES.     Not men.    Men don't notice.    Not one little bit.     Think about it.|`|nhZb43pIaa	I disagree with your statement.    I believe there are many others species in which the female attracts the male. Just because you don't notice it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  Take Lions...the most physically fit females are chosen first as well as the youngest. The will birth an heir and make excellent huntresses for the pride.   The male Lion is not going to pick the lioness who is the gentlest in pride but has a swayed back, low muscle ton, and nappy fur.  He will choose the well muscled, young, fast, shiny pelted b&tch.  They also put out sounds, smells, and gestures that attract a male. They do what they have to as it also provides themself with their rank within the pride.    That's life in the big jungle and the big city.

AA10895669	I would assume in our addictive and co-dependent culture, filled with excuses for aberrant human behaviors, that they are just under the influence of high levels of testosterone. So what ever the reason, it really isn't their fault (Sarcastic)!    Really though it's been found that high levels of testosterone can create an aggressive behavior, in women as well as men (women with large chins are also thought to be promiscuous!).     Some things in these macho behavior, used to be admirable and thought to be desirable because of their enhancements of the best parts of a man. In today's culture anything masculine or patriarchal is looked down on, so it goes to follow that the extreme behavior of highly aggressive man (machismo) would be demonized exponentially. The lack of control and confusion in today's society to distinguish between good male behavior and bad male behavior have complicated male personalities even more (men in many cases simply propagate and provide). As is, there is a lack of judgment by society given on good and bad female behaviors. With out cultural standards the extremes are allowed to flourish. The contrary is that in all attempts to create a more perfect world, humans have always diminished certain behaviors as problematic.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Why do some women need to dress like hoes in order to validate their femininity?

She'll ingorantly refuse to acknowledge that's it's none of her business how one may or may not show emotions in front of people or privately.  Thanks Jenn for proving my consistent point that feminists are mostly hypocritical liars.    edit-Oh jenn, your 2nd paragraph was no better than your first.  First men who do that are inhuman in your self-righteous eyey even though it's a very human thing to do.  Did you ever think that the constant tears from women over every little thing (eg some ridiculous tear-jerker flick) get a little bit annoying from a man's point of view.  Did that ever cross your narrow mind? I'd take offense to your grow up comment, but coming from such a misery such as yourself, all I do is recognize where's it's coming from.

The ideas in both of  these texts, written a half century ago,  are relevant to so many ways in which thought is constantly being closed off in popular discourse, in the media, , in political spin, and even in academic texts, today.    They both are based on the principal that critical thinking should be sceptical about so called 'value free' sceptics. An idea best exemplified by the1930s aphorism:    'he was open minded his brains fell out'     So they are critiques not only of false philosophies but also of the even more deadly  'numbing down as dumbing down' .  That is they are mounting a thorough critiique of those who argue that every philosophic and political  position is a false position therefore we  should never engage in any form of political or social critique.

AA10127184	The world can often seem inevtably scary. There are too many opportunities for things like this to happen.    But, Jay - you're a survivor. I wish we could reach out and pat you on the back; perhaps it's best we do it 'figuratively,' not physically! That said, some people just would say "You're a survivor, you're strong" and think that was that - OK to say "You're done, you can do this" -- but we know there's more to the story. You're not five, you didn't fall off a bicycle and learn to get back up; you're in a time and place where thugs with crappy attitudes have rage and roam selfishly. The guy violated your sense of trust, zapped your energy, and frustrated/put a hiccup in your life by making you go through tons of bureaucracy and calls to cancel cards and so on. No one should have that happen; it;s not OK; it's not enough to say "Easy, sistah, you made it through."    Jay, you've got a strong will and a good head on your shoulders.   Use all the resources you have ... carefully and when you need 'em. For example, some people will listen again and again; identify that support network. Some people will be superficial and move on ... or be uncomfortable discussing it ... but might do you other favors. Assess those things. While you certainly aren't going to manipulate anyone because you got hurt, you need to make use of the assets you have. It will make you feel stronger and make you feel like you have more of a long-term plan.    I haven't been in your shoes, but I remember the feeling of almost being killed in a car crash a few years ago. How does this relate? That hideous feeling of "What just happened?" and "How can I be in a car/on the road?" is probably a little like the feelings you've had, particularly the 'nervous to go anywhere' part. The only thing to say there? When others have violated our trust (it's even like a bad relationship, where someone cheats), we find ways to breath in, breath out ... and come up with a way to think about what happened and how it will or won't affect us. Some people try to pretend it won't affect 'em; that's just putting things off. You can either make real efforts to 'do the things you did' before (the 'regain all your freedoms' method, so to speak), or you can think about what happened with that good strong head on your shoulders and see if you want to 'put in lace' some changes (the 'reasonable precautions' method, so to speak) to satisfy your mind you're being 'prudent enough' not to be a high risk again.     The world goes on and has soooooo much happening that we can't imagine we can control all of it. If we did, we probably wouldn't like all of it, anyway. But what we can do is find ways to make the msot of what is good ... and see where our trust is reasonable.    You, Jay, have probably handled the crappy necessary/immediate reactions. Sometimes the long-term effects seem worse - having to deal with the not wanting to go out. But, Jay, breath in, breath out, and find ways to work it out.

The cup starts saying "O man, I am beautiful right now, but what was the state of my being before the pot-maker made me a beautiful pot?     Before I was sheer mud and the pot-maker pulled me out of the mud from the mother earth and I felt why that pot-maker is so cruel, he has separated me from mother earth. I felt a tremendous pain. And the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me and churned me, when I was churned I felt so giddy, so painful, so stressful, I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then he put me into a oven and heated me up, I felt completely burnt. There was tremendous pain and I asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait."     Then he poured hot paint on me and I felt the fume and the pain, I again asked the pot-maker "Why are you so cruel?" and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." Then again he put me into an oven and heated it to make me more strong, I felt life is so painful hence pleaded the pot-maker and the pot-maker said, "Just wait." And after that the pot-maker took me to the mirror and said, "Now look at yourself". And surprisingly I found myself so beautiful.     When god gives us lot of trouble, it appears god is very cruel but we need patience and we have to wait. When bad things happen to good people, they become better and not bitter.     So all difficulties are part of a cosmic design to make us really beautiful. We need patience, we need understanding, we need the commitment to go through in a very calm and wise way. So all difficulties are not to tumble us but to humble us.     With this understanding, let us not be against difficulty. Understand difficulty is a part of a purifying process. A purifying process at present which we cannot understand and hence we need faith and we need trust.     Let us understand how to handle stress with this background. You can be affected by stress from two angles. There is an internal stress and there is an external stress. Nobody can avoid stress; one has to only manage stress. Managing stress can be internal and also external.     The internal stress is; your thoughts can create stress, your values can create stress, and your beliefs can create stress, meaning thereby your stress is coming from your mind more from the outer world. Many people suffer not from heart attack - they suffer from thought-attack.     For example, when somebody says you are an idiot, we get so hurt, we get so victimised. My boss has called me an idiot and I am feeling tremendous pain. Now where does this stress come from? If my boss has called me an idiot, I have to ask myself "am I an idiot"?     If I am an idiot nothing to be upset about; and if I am not an idiot, then also nothing to be upset about! It is the perception of the boss. But why do we suffer from that stress? I suffer not because my boss has called me an idiot but because of the thought-attack.     I may say the boss has called me an idiot; therefore I am suffering? It is true that the words are unpleasant. But what hurts is the interpretation of the unpleasant word. The thought in me interprets. That is pain and therefore it becomes pain. Much of our stress is our mind interpreting it as pain. So we suffer from thought-attack more than heart attack.|`|410a53847625a45b2c149b33b534958daa	I would join a support group.|`|AA11005859	Call the police!Describe the man!|`|u94alKNjaa	what can anyone really do for you? youve already seemed to have come to terms with it and accepted that it could have been worse.|`|aaef5adc08ad392b97bfdfdf35624052aa	Well be grateful you are still alive and well.

He may not have stolen your money but he could still get your Identity.|`|AA11116939	I am so glad you are O.K.   I can't imagine what you must be going through. It's so unfortunate that your right to feel safe was taken away by that guy. It makes sense to me that you would be nervous to go out. I hope you have a great support system that can be with you right now. Keep doing what you're doing. Talk about it. Know that whatever you feel is what you should be feeling. You will be in my thoughts.|`|AA12073698	listen the police will catch him they will be on top of there game and i think that you shouldn't let that stop u from going any where just be careful and feel better and i glad that u r ok|`|AA10262070	I would be a nervous wreck.|`|dfa15239800ae4ef42475d3aee99ac90aa	Wow.  I am glad that hasn't happened to me.  It's hard for someone who has never been assaulted at random to sympathize beyond being sorry for what you've been through.  I imagine myself feeling much like you are feeling now.  I guess since life must go on, I would have to force myself to venture outside on a daily basis.  I would probably carry either pepper spray or a small knife in my purse as well.  I guess I'd try and make sure that I am always in places that are well lit, and well populated.    I would try and take comfort in the fact that odds are, this won't happen to me again.  Maybe you could change your daily routine.  Walk to a different bus stop, or leave for work/school earlier in the day.  Anything I could do to make myself feel safer, I'd be doing.  I hope that you get through this.  You may want to consider seeing a counsellor or therapist.  Try going to your doctor for a referral.  Good Luck with everything!    P.S.  Report your ss number stolen.  People can really mess with your identity once they have that.|`|BdkOrfLjaa	I was at an ATM in side a grocery store right beside the service desks. When a drunk man in front of me couldn't get the machine to work. He stumbled away mumbling some thing I could understand. I stepped to the machine swiped my card and Then I felt this hand pushing the back of my neck and pushed my head into the screen of the ATM. I jerked away unharmed and told him not to touch me. He got right in my face and started yelling about how he was going to beat me up. None of it made any sense to me, he didn't want anything. He did not try to rob me. I was scared and after the man slid out the door the store Mgr finally showed up and walked me out to my car. I could remember my husbands cell phone number which is so odd because I can dial it without even looking at the number pad on my phone. I didn't go back to that store for a long time. I still get funny feelings when I go in there. I hope you feel better soon. Find something that makes you laugh and think about it when you start to panic it worked for me. Best of wishes.
05fe207ba2c172effa44a53cd561b351aa	You were abused.   The analogy is so simple here : a child should never -never- be exposed to any physical or emotional harm at all no matter how difficult or complicated he/she is. Once a child received a harmful maltreatment (whether it's physically or emotionally) from someone, it is  considered as a child abuse.    All you can do now is seeking a help through a psychotherapy or anything that will make you not repeating the same treatments you've received before.   Child abuse is like a domino effect. The way you raise your children is most likely the way you were raised before. The way you treat your child is most likely the way you were treated before. A domino effect. So. you may now had left already all the traumatic abusive moments in your life behind. But the defect is still in you.  It could 'attack' you like a shark and it could really turn you to become the same like those who were abused you before. You might do or repeat the same bad things like those who did it to you before, to your own offspring. So, you really have to realize here that all child abuse victims must and need to seek some helps in order for not making them get sucked into the same black hole.|`|TRLRsNwWaa	I'd say so yes.    Standards are changing, what is abuse now, was considered just normal life years ago.    To me, if you are feeling this way now, then something was wrong back then.    I wish you would go back and edit your posting though, you put your e-mail in there and there are a lot of very unpleasant people out there. Please can you go back and edit your question, so it doesn't have one of your e-mail addys in it?    I wish you well!|`|AA11725989	Yes, I'd say you were abused....What you do with yourself now is what counts....it's over,,,horrible as it was, move on and don't repeat it.....|`|5d8803cd718f312df17e40c2db884bd6aa	Yes you were abused. You should better yourself though. There's many people ( such as myself) that had a bad childhood but don't let it stop them from prospering. The people that go through struggles are the ones that have the greatest life. That's what life is about, surviving so in fact you are living. God bless you and i hope you can recover from this. Because it can truly scar you for life.|`|CilwffzPaa	I am SO sorry, your experiences are horrible. I think you were definitely abused, but I am not a psychiatrist or therapist but have been to many. It might help to find a good therapist to discuss this issue with. Good luck!

e2DEQ6Euaa	Before I state my recommended "cure", I would like you to reconsider. So what if you like popping balloons? Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, why feel guilty? Please rethink before going through.    If you really want to stop, go slow. First, stop asking women to pop balloons for you. Second, start making balloons that you cannot pop. Like fill them with water than freeze them into ice. Ween yourself off balloons. One more action you can do is simply separate yourself from any and all balloons till you become more comfortable.    A different approach is to find other things you can do with a balloon, like rubbing it on your head to get your hair to stand.
1hlIzEnTaa	I would typically have said us women... however,I'm in a situation right now where we hooked up and things were fine at first.. seemed like we were on the same page just having fun, but then he started telling me he was in love with me, wants to date and even move in together! I was stunned, as I have zero feelings for him! Ofcourse I would get the stage 5 clinger!|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Women - obviously. Is this a trick question?|`|PwvU3LQBaa	I had a male friend that became extremely attached to me and we never were intimate.  I had no feeling for him other than friendship.

So the weaker the frame of mind the more they can become attached.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Duh|`|tTIXhe7daa	Woman don't look at the mind first without looking at the appearance. You have to look at a person's appearance to even know that they exist as a form. SO if  woman do that than everybody is the same. We are all emotional when it comes to a breakup everything else. Woman are   sensitive and honest and kind. All of those feelings inside of them make them think positive and be in good spirits. Now when a guy which is seen as tough, big , strong, don't seem to have those traits but it's there. So woman being kinder and sweeter than men are more emotional. But men are emotional but not as much as woman. But there are some guys that can be  emotional  like woman probably.
2cdbdb9c70693098a102bc9dcb19222baa	They say that dreams is the opposite of our waking lives, you should stop chasing guys with mysterious background.. :D or guys you never know.. no matter how hawt he is.

F5bT2wAraa	I know that you said you have no time for meditation but there is a type of meditation that is REALLY practical using sound vibration.  You can do it pretty much at all times when walking or right after you wake up or before you go to bed.  Gau-Ra-An-Ga is the mantra that you keep repeating either in your mind or out loud.  Out loud is better.  And you listen to the sound.  If you combine your breathing with it it will be even better.  So basically you take a deep breath in and in out going breath say Gau-Ra-An-Ga to the length of your breath.  Repeat for as long as you can fit in your schedule.  15 min a day or more but try to do it every day rather than one day for an hour and a few days none.  Take care.  I hope it helps.  Keep in touch if you like.

Usually one is interested in understanding why she's not interested in marriage and it really depends on her age as often her perspective may not remain stable with time so it's actually more important that she focus on why she is so disinterested in marriage as opposed to finding a term for this.  Sometimes a lady may not have an interest in finding her "Mr.Right" and it doesn't necessarily means that she's Feminists, lesbian or anything like that.  An old woman who remains unmarried is referred to as a 'spinster.'  Some women simply don't enjoy sexual relationships with men at all or are asexual for any number of reasons.  It can get awfully complicated.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	"not looking for a relationship". Or if she's old enough, a "spinster".    Gaffa: I don't know about spinster being offensive.

I am not interested in getting married, but I still like dating men, and have a child. I am just not interested in sharing a home with someone other then my kid (and yes, cats!)  lol  this is not a bad thing, it just means that some women do not have to be attached to a man to be happy. too many women settle for marriages that are not happy just because they think they cannot be with out a man.|`|vEj7xoBraa	satan.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Umm...legally single?  I don't think that there's an actual word for it (besides spinster, but that's pretty insulting/antiquated).    Jenn:  Maybe it's a regional thing, but the only time that I've ever heard the word spinster used in conversation is when it's coming from the gossipy old women at my church.  They've always meant it as slightly derogatory, so that's the association that I've always had.  Could be different elsewhere though.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Bachelorette.|`|u1vEj8DYaa	"A woman with other things on her mind".|`|jN8duTx2aa	A feminist is a woman who believes in equality of the sexes.

It is a fact that in most cases, alikes stay together longer, opposites attract, but only for a short time.  if you dont consider him smart or educated, your'e most likely going to have a problem.|`|lYgFyjw0aa	staple something of his!

Have you argued about the issue? Is he serious, or does he say it with a smile? If its all a joke, no harm done, but if its not, then I would rethink my relationship with this person who is trying to keep you from realising your potential.     Whether he realises what he is doing is wrong or not, I would not accept this behaviour, and would either have a serious discussion, or leave him behind in his fantasy-land where nothing changes and he is always the smartest.|`|F9ZY4EeIaa	hes a freakin retard|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	1.

2aRv8GPMaa	He is using some deceptive or manipulative method to earn her trust or at least to lure her to a place or a mental/emotional state in which she will benefit the man.   This would be like the infamous serial killer Ted Bundy who would go out with girls, telling them he was a law student and he was good looking, so he attracted these women. He would then murder them. He knew he wanted to murder them all along.
Yg1QR4mmaa	If you feel this way then find a way to dedicate your life into making the lives of others better. The sad truth of the matter is that this will always happen, it is part of human nature to destroy what we build and each other. I think that you should stop looking at the negatives in life so much, there is so much beauty in the world and I can promise if you will contribute to the that, even in the most menial way, you will feel better about yourself. If you do this, don't do it for yourself, do it for others.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	If you take on the problems of the world, you will stay overwhelmed.

I'm almost there and I found out through living in the ghetto and being around people who put me down, that life is about when you  keep going on even when the odds are against you and people think you're done for. I remember the tale about the two rats from Catch Me If You Can. There were two rats who fell into a bucket of cream. One gave up and quickly died. The other kept trying and trying and he turned that cream into butter and walked out. It's about not giving up and being happy that you made it that far. It's like running when your dying of thirst and your legs hurt so badly. It's scaling that high mountain and reaching the top and feeling that your on top of the world. It's about showing to yourself who you really are and learning to live and becoming what you wanted to be, and no one absolutely no one can take away your hope from you, because it's always the last thing to die.|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	ugh. join the club honey we all feel this way.     don't let it bring you down too much beacuse it'll drive you crazy.

I think you mean suffering, not suffrage.  Suffrage is the right to vote.
u5AMqHevaa	Given an MPC, one can find how much an initial amount of spending will amount to as the money circulates through the economy:  change in GDP= 1/(1-MPC) * change in spending=   1/(1-.8)*1000=$25,000. So 25,000 is the total increase in GDP and the multiplier is 5.

By giving women the right to vote, they gained more national power plus they lacked the already established laws in the east stopping women from voting.|`|NYU37jfGaa	The Western states were anxious to attract female settlers, there was a chronic shortage of women in the west.  Giving women the vote was one way of making western states seem more attractive to women.    Wyoming  was the first place to grant the vote to women, in 1869,and they also passed legislation to protect women's property rights and require equal pay for female schoolteachers (who were generally paid a lot less than male teachers).  "We now expect quite an immigration of ladies to Wyoming" said the Cheyenne Leader after both the House and Senate voted in favour of the suffrage bill.    The first dozen states to give women the right to vote were all in the WEst.  Wyoming just managed to beat out Utah, which passed a suffrage law in February 1870.  Colorad and Idaho followed suit before 1900.  Wyoming was not the only state passing laws in hopes that more women might want to emigrate.  When the California legislature was debating a married women's property act, one bachelor argued that the proposal was "the very best provision to get us wives that we can introduce into the Constitution."

nyylb6qUaa	Hello friend. I understand what you are talking about. I have suicidal tendencies just like you. I have had them for years, even when I was in school. I have nobody in my life. These tendencies have always stayed with me, no matter what. It just gets to a point where you get used to them. You might want to see a shrink. No embarrassment there, I see one also. Don't give up, even though it is hard. Cast all your cares on me if you need to. My e-mail is themark08@yahoo.com if you ever want to talk. May God Bless You.|`|fZjHAxwHaa	listen.  youre doing great in life  there is not need to die  (:|`|Fkvk49ngaa	Have you tried seeking pharmacological help? I know a lot of people don't like taking drugs, but I think in your case, SSRIs can help. Basically, they block the reuptake of seratonin, which can help elevate your mood, decrease the panic disorder, and subsequently diminish the suicidal thoughts. Just something to think about and maybe mention to your psychiatrist.

During cease fire one or both resolve to discuss the issue, if necessary in the presence of a disinterested third party.

That all factors in...but, what I've found is that many times when there is tension people tend to assume that the other person is an "enemy" or doesn't want to communicate any longer and so you decide that person is your enemy...but if you would talk it through you would find that is not the case. Only in extreme cases do people become total enemies - other than that it is usually a misunderstanding, hurt feelings or miscommunication. The best thing to do is talk it out and try to be as clear as possible...don't assume anything....if you aren't sure about what your hearing ask follow up questions to clarify...because it doesn't seem like the "enemy" status your talking about is one that both parties want.|`|b130d64eacb57af7bbee0fda7b233748aa	'enemies' are people who fail to understand each others reason, motive, logic, investment, feeling, ...  communication is the foundation of friendship, in it are found trust, truth, dependability, reliance, loyalty, strength, tolerance, understanding...  ...'anger' is a single letter from 'danger'....|`|tsldWIs4aa	The old aphorism "absence makes the heart grow fonder" after a little bit of time has lessened the shock of whatever it was that caused the fight, the two should start to remember why they were friends to begin with.|`|8vyhc3sEaa	distance ....a cooling off period... might take days/weeks sometimes even months but may as well say nothing to eachother if theres nothing nice to say right... atleast till the times right and both the concerned parties have resolved the issue with themselves before with eachother !!

To overcome your phobia, you must openly take the advices that your concerned friends will tell to you: you must be strong-willed and ready to accept your own failures. Also, try to see your phobia as a thing that cannot kill or endanger you. If everything doesn't do the work try to see a psychologist.

AA12220935	Well, psycological teaching tell u that dreams are often reflections of our deires or worries.  Anythingthat is on our mind that arises whilewe are asleep can be meterpreted by your brain into pictures based on the subject.  For example, you may have thought recently about suicide, or are a hard-core goth(And we all know what a tight connection goths and death have, don't we.^_^), and your brain showed you a picture depicting that which, in your opinion, might happen should you suicide, or your desire - that after you die you should rise for the night to walk the earth, as a vampire.    It's all highly personal, though, and i can only assume those things.  You could look it up in some dream-decrypter book or something, but don't rely on that, solely, as only YOU can know for surewhat YOUR dream means.|`|PiwVQ9Ldaa	You best go home now!|`|aa50ccfdb5145cad214514960d280ff8aa	Perhaps the dream is about  something that you feel is  killing you. Or in your way.|`|60384339c6fed5ac3fb203bca5de6893aa	according to a dream book i have,,,,    A graveyard: psychological meaning... Something within you has died. You must discover what it is and why it has been returned to the unconscious, here symbolized by the earth. Alternatively, the grave may be a pun, suggesting that you are facing a "grave situation" or it could simply be a reflection of your own thoughts about death and mortality.     mystical meaning: Superstitions say that this dream means you will experience a loss but not necessarily a death. Some superstitions say that the dream foretells news of a marriage.|`|H3EPc5lkaa	After giving it some thought here are my theories which may be accurate or inaccurate, I will let you decide. It could be that you are expressing concern for deceased relations and friends or a longing for the past.  It could also be an expression of current difficulties you may be having or even a fear of death itself.  I hope this helped you.|`|b8e06cd70ef9d7c6ba8d8c7eeb7b3c98aa	My job has some difficult programming issues to resolve. In times, some of the subject matter can be very difficult.    I will then spent all my time and energy tries to come up with a solution so I will not lose face among my peers and my bosses.    Some times, this can go on for the same issue for several days, weeks. During this period, my dreams are full of strange ways to attack the problems. In many occasions, there were detailed source code and test attempts.    But, since this is still in the dream state, nothing really comes out and makes sense after I wake up.    The reason I am telling you this is, my mother always dreams about her childhood friends, she dreamed about talking to them. While in my dreams, the contents were actually work related.     There is no way in the world my mother will have a dream of how to detect a failing network connection after TCP handshake was completed successfully.    Your dreams are therefore entirely reflecting your daily mental activities that consumed highest of your inner domain.    Since you dreamed about graveyard, this will be highly related what graveyard mean to you.  To some, it is a place they will never go, but for others, graveyard is just a place some one was buried there.    Naturally, this is tightly tie to the life and death of your feeling in recent days, and that's where you should find the decode hints to ease off your worry.    After all, dream is only the activity while you sleep. Any interpretations will be needless and worthless.    You need to gather confidence and create some achievements in your life to lift your spirit and self-esteem.|`|094e296fa929099f24fd8f51a81082eaaa	Dream analysis requires someone whom you trust, and time to unravel your personal set of symbolic-imagery.    From your description though, I wouldn't be surprised if it was somehow related to how you feel about vampires.    It could be wish fulfillment, but that seems rather superficial.    More likely it has to do with you feeling that something about yourself is akin to the mythical vampire, for example, you might feel you are an emotional vampire, leeching off others feeling for your own pleasure.     Or you could be a used car salesman.
HOr4t81aaa	No, ninguno. Lo que hay es HEMBRISMO, pero no es ninguna postura terica, sino simplemente un prejuicio igual de malsano que el MACHISMO.    Lo que dice CIBERTRONIX, no tiene ningn fundamento. Yo soy feminista (hombre) y s de lo que hablo.    En cuanto a MILENIUM: deberas hacer ms lecturas. Dime UN SOLO texto feminista donde se abogue por la superioridad femenina. No hay NI UN SOLO argumento en el feminismo en ese sentido.    MILENIUM: Me dices que lea con cuidado. Eso voy a hacer. Te cito: "una buena parte de las feministas NO ENCUENTRAN UN MEJOR ARGUMENTO que justifique su activsimo, que PROCLAMAR LA INFERIORIDAD DEL HOMBRE".    Te voy a explicar unos conceptos bsicos: arriba y abajo. Cuando algo est arriba, necesariamente es que hay algo debajo. Si las feministas proclaman que el hombre est abajo o es inferior, no hay que tener muchas luces para deducir que la mujer estar arriba y ser superior.    Pues mira, leyendo con cuidado llego a la misma conclusin que al principio. Si quieres lo reformulo: no hay NI UN SOLO texto feminista que defienda la inferioridad del hombre, o LO QUE ES LO MISMO, la superioridad de la mujer.      PD.- Ciertamente, no es el lugar de enzarzarnos a discutir en el mal sentido. Y perdn, pero mi irona responda a un calificativo que ya has borrado de tu texto. Yo no hice ms de lo que me hicieron.    Vamos al asunto. ?Y quin es esa tipa? He intentado buscarla por el google y ni sombra. Hombre, nmbrame una terica conocida (Butler, Braidotti, Benhabib, Fraser, Irigaray, etc.). No me vale que hayas cogido a cualquier colgada que ha plasmado en su libro sus frustraciones. Esto por la parte emprica.    Por la parte lgica del argumento: si esa tal Olivier defendiese la inferioridad masculina, ENTONCES SERA HEMBRISTA, no feminista. Yo puedo decir que soy comunista y defender el despido libre. Pero una cosa es lo que se es y otra lo que se cree ser.    En cuanto a las activistas el mismo argumento. Yo puedo escuchar todo el da bossa nova y decir que soy muy heavy. Pero del dicho al hecho va un trecho. Una chica que desprecia al macho no es feminista, sino HEMBRISTA.|`|1a3217030aadee82c77c40bfbb36ece0aa	Si, el feminismo se descrive como el opuesto al machismo... por lo tanto denomina a las ideas que dicen superior a la mujer...    Es por esta situacion que la licha por los derechos de la mujer no se llama feminismo, sino LUCHA POR LOS DERECHOS DE LA MUJER|`|IXZW0etoaa	yo creo que todos los que luchan por el feminismo buscan solo la igualdad, ya que esta lucha es mas bien para que se acabe el machismo que durante siglos se ha estado viviendo y la mujer tenga derechis al igual que el hombre|`|6b4f5adc19422f36316e467c45070f6daa	Cuando se habla de superioridad de la mujer,se podra entender que es a nivel  general. Pero si desde ahora ests pensando en una superioridad, es decir en que entre los dos sexos existe  alguien superior, le estas dando ese lugar a los masculinos. No  seoy machista, pero solamente basta ver en nuestro entorno y se vera la superioridad de sexos. Los animales, en el sexo masculino siempre son mas bellos y fuertes en el 99%, En la raza humana el hombre no se pinta para rsaltar su belleza, es natural, fsicamente es mas fuerte y por lo tanto sus trabajos son   de fuerza y habilidad. ?Cuntas mujeres son presidentas no digamos de pases, sino solamente de empresas o dirigentes? Si sacamos un clculo conservador, este sera como del 1.5%. La nica superioridad de la mujer se podra ver reflejada en el estudio y en el de la aplicacin de su sexo como smbolo de feminismo, con cierto pudor y esa sensualidad que a los hombrs nos encanta prescisamente por venir de una mujer. Pierde todo una mujer cuando la escuchas hablar como hombre y decir palabras como "gey" o "no manches" , heredades de ese estpido de adal ramones que solo le vino a partir la m a nuestro idioma. Realzate con el estudio y no vas a volver a preguntar quien sera mejor, porque de lejos se vera el rflejo de tu saber.|`|3af63d7015556807aed9a2acd2c03987aa	Lo ke he visto en las feministas de YR es ke proclaman una superioridad del genero femenino  a cada momento y un subvaloracion del masculino, eso es algo ke he visto en un sin numero de preguntas y respuestas.  Yo siempre he estado defendiendo una posicion de igualdad y complemento entre generos, pero a veces creo ke eso no es lo ke busca el feminismo a juzgar por las opiniones ke veo en este medio por parte de muchas mujeres.  Yo creo ke mas de una debe estar resentida de cierta forma por el papel ke en casi toda la historia habia desempe?ado la mujer, pero deberian entender ke la opcion no es tomar venganza contra la situacion del pasado e imponerse a los hombres sino trabajar en conjunto para un mejor futuro de ambos.

Y aunque muchos hombres se lo merezcan el odio no es la solucin.    Se tiene que trabajar por una igualdad justa, como por ejemplo, igualdad en el trabajo y dejarse de tonteras de guerras de sexo.

Dentro del feminismo y durante la historia hubo diferentes corrientes (es lgico, no todas pensamos igual) Y se cre un feminismo de la diferencia, sobre todo ubicado en Italia.    Estas mujeres no se definan como superiores, simplemente diferentes al hombre.     Pero esa corriente es minoritaria, tanto que en ocasiones ni siquiera se estudia.     Me hubiera gustado poder leer a este que debata aqu pero no llegu a tiempo.    Slo matizar. Lo de que el macho en algunas especies animales sea ms lindo o vistoso no tiene nada que ver con la superioridad, ms bien al contrario.

No hay varios tipos sino criterios de fminas sobre el papel de la mujer en la historia del mundo y la necesidad constante de cambios alrededor de la visin sobre la importancia de la mujer en las diversas facetas en que incursiona.    Hay que recordar que el movimiento feminista naci en virtud de una protesta abierta ante la sensacin de injusticia a la expresin legtima de las emociones, valores e inconformidades de la mujer por  la desvalorizacin del trabajo de la mujer dentro del hogar y fuera de l.  Socialmente, relegarla al plano de un simple complemento del hombre con anulacin total de su persona y la va para la formacin de una familia y laboralmente - que lo hace forzosamente la mujer a raz del inicio de las Guerras Mundiales - como el material de refuerzo para la fabricacin de armas y manutencin del nivel econmico alcanzado, gracias a la ayuda de los hombres, en sus respectivos pases.    La superioridad de la mujer no existe filosficamente hablando pero en la mente humana la sensacin de inferioridad y la nocin equivocada de la verdadera grandeza de la mujer ( pues la verdadera grandeza de la mujer radica en su sabidura, su visin de esperanza, su coraje, su entrega, su determinacin ) hacen que nazcan concepciones erradas. Y me pregunto yo ... ?ser que si la grandeza de la mujer radica en los factores descritos el hombre no las tendr tambin ?.    Concluyo en que lo importante no es hacer notar los rasgos que nos diferencian sino los que nos acercan ... los que nos hacen a hombres y mujeres decir que pertenecemos a un mismo gnero : EL GENERO HUMANO.
AA11609393	More sleep is always better than less!|`|AA11249457	It depends on where youre flying from??? the longer flights you can wake up the night before but short flights wouldn't be much difference to get some sleep|`|Rqb5tjFQaa	I had the exact same dilemma when I flew to California from the UK, but I was leaving a couple of hours later. I decided I was going to try and stay awake all night partly because I thought I'd be late up and also because i still had things to pack. I finally threw in the towel about 2 or 3am.    Have you flown before? It really all depends on how long your flight is and whether you find it easy to sleep outside home i.e. on a plane or not. I'd say probably try and go to bed early and get atleast a couple of hours sleep. You can still go to sleep (if you're able to) during flight, to get that extra sleep.
de716a7218c6535ff5cb2a195dc59d50aa	The superego is the last of the three elements to develop, and is the ethical component of the personality, providing the moral standards by which the ego operates.     The superego is formed during the first five years of life in response to parental punishment and approval; children internalize their parents' moral standards as well as those of the surrounding society, and the developing superego serves to control aggressive or other socially unacceptable impulses.    Violation of the superego's standards gives rise to feelings of guilt or anxiety.    If we did not form a superego, we would be always acting on impulse, getting into trouble or putting ourselves into situations that could cause us harm.|`|YuAmsQL3aa	We would end up with serious lack of confidence and very little motivation.

7a66fd2ed9d9f3b7cdb917cf9b78bf0faa	You are lucky. You have a man who feels the responsibility of fatherhood. He sounds like a very old-fashioned man who believes that he should be the bread winner, not his pregnant partner! I'm not trying to make you feel guilty about working but I think that he won't get his self-esteem back until he finds a job. His ego is battered because he feels like he can't provide for his family. This is quite a hard situation because the only thing you can do is just encourage him with his job hunting and make him feel like a man and a good boyfriend. Make him feel that, just becase he doesn't have a job YET, he is still all man in your eyes. Just let him know that you always feel like he is there when you really need him and that your life would be incomplete without him.|`|AA12250290	TEll him that face is not important!

It is not your responsibility to make him feel better, and the truth is, you can't, no matter how much you might want to.  All you can do is offer support and encourage him when he takes action to overcome his depression.    It might help to illustrate what power he DOES have over his life situation.  For example, he's not working - ok, but is he looking for work?   Taking action is a demonstration of power.    Is he doing things around the house to prepare for baby's arrival?  Painting a bedroom, building some piece of furniture you'll need, even researching the specifications of car seats are all things that he can do to provide for a baby arriving.    I think the two of you need to have a serious discussion of how responsibilities are to be divided in your relationship -  for now and especially for after the baby arrives. If  you have a stable job, and the  income and benefits are good, perhaps he can be the primary caregiver and work part time, while you focus on career and maximizing you earnings.   If he has skills that could land him a better job, then he needs to pound the pavement and find work.   What's important is that you come to a workable arrangement to provide for your family.  Your arrangement does not have to fit anyone else's mold for what family life "should" be.... it only has to work for YOU.|`|7c98c94fc336e78662c8ec3f737c0de3aa	First off stop telling him its ok because its not. He's in a position where he feels he can't contribute anything to the home your going to bring you newborn child into. He has been emasculated and he doesn't need your pity. In most cases people will tell you to say you love him and that you will support him and everything will be ok. This is pretty common advise and just as common ineffective. What your husband needs is to feel he is contributing something to the household.  Put the man to work ...  Most guys won't take 'hey honey I made a list of things for you to do today' very well. What you need to do is use a little subtlety in presenting the opportunity for him to contribute.   It can be as simple as the toilet not flushing you need him to fix it, maybe a light switch doesn't work because a fuse blew. Little fix its like this can slowly rebuild his self worth and get him moving in the right direction.

And it is hard, because people just tell me to break out of my shell or whatever. And that makes me feel worse, because then i doubt my sanity, as if it is all in my head.     I know that if i don't change, nobody will like me. However, i'm having more trouble controlling how i come across than i thought...and that is depressing. People are judgmental - if you are socially awkward, it is hard to find people who will accept you for who you are. Decades of experience has taught me this.     I think you need some real evidence of success. Perhaps you can talk to someone you know well and ask them to give you feedback on how you come across. Specific things. Maybe if you do that, you can change certain things.     I too come across as incredibly dumb...so really how controllable is that. Just don't let anyone heap you loads of guilt that you are somehow stubborn or not willing to help yourself. This is a tough battle, and I have no answers.    Perhaps you can get some social skills training. You may have a neurological issue. Sorry you are feeling this way.

I was nominated class clown in high school. everyone was like "ashley tell a joke or tell a story or something." I felt this immense pressure to be entertaining all the time. I used to hang with a bunch of "friends" all the time, I mean I liked them but I get bored of people and usually stop talking to them after a while. I'm lonely and have social anxiety and usually have to be on something to be around people because I don't particularly like many people. So I think I'm probably just a b*tch. You however are not hopeless, but you may want to talk to a therapist or doctor or psychiatrist about this. They'll be able to help you overcome this better than the advice you get from here. I'm pretty sure you have thought about all of these things before and implementing the changes is a lot harder than saying it. These are brain re-wiring, thought and behavioral changes that you have to make. It doesn't happen over night. You have to change how you feel about yourself and then everything else will follow.

xGb2CBgkaa	recently, iceland, which has its own currency, suffered a collapse in its currency as a result of horribly risky decisions that its banks made.  this is the nature of banking, which exacts a revenge when bankers make poor decisions.  iceland's bankers will have learned from this mistake, and will hopefully get their act together.  if they were part of the euro, they would not be suffering the same collapse since they are on the euro, and the euro region would suffer from their bad judgement.  this is a major moral hazard consideration.    another reason why 1 currency doesn't make any sense is that each country will lose the ability to control monetary policy.  so they won't be able to control local inflation or stimulate local economies when they hit recessions.    a one currency model would be disasterous.|`|pnZssBg9aa	I don't understand your question. Do you mean that the world has many different currencies (US dollars, UK pound, Japanese Yen, etc) or that many financial transactions are carried out in US dollars?  If you are referring to the US dollar, then yes, the world uses the US dollar as a reference when converting to other currencies or measuring the values of other currencies. This was because the Bretton Woods system collapsed in the 1970s.|`|zC7pkdK1aa	Well actually at first there may not be any major change but it will eventually become larger.    First of all, if the world had only one currency there will be no point of currency transaction services provided by banks. Thus, those who work in that department will likely be laid off and thus must find jobs elsewhere.     Second, there will likely be no proper regulation of the currency. A country's currency worth can represent "economic power" to some degree. However, if all the nations were to have one currency, then other countries out of our jurisdiction will probably print money like crazy to cover their debts. This leads to inflation in not only the country's economy, but in the world's as well, raising costs and reducing welfare of others.     The only benefit I can only see is no more need to pay transaction fees for overseas business operations.     You can view this in a good or bad way, its really up to you and where you stand.    Hopes this helps!|`|l0oDymHYaa	It would be wasting time thinking about it. Because it is not likely to happen even in the wildest dreams|`|jNQbVDHSaa	nothing|`|c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	I think it's a great idea. The US, before the Revolutionary War, had many different currencies issued by each State, and sometimes even by the local goldsmith (I think -- I read about this in Barbara Tuchman's March of Folly). After they standardized the currency, there was a great benefit to trading because they didn't have to argue about how much this or that currency was worth, and the money (well, notes) were redeemable anywhere.     But people won't like letting go of their national currency, especially if they think they will get the short end of the stick. Look at all the controversies that changing over to the Euro has caused. But, in 20 years or so, I think most people will be glad they did it.    BUT, you won't be able to convince the Euro people to change currency AGAIN after such a short period of time, so I don't think the world will have one currency anytime soon. Also, we need to get the countries all on a more even economic footing before we make a switch. However, it's not a bad idea.    (-: Except I think for some Christians, a one-world currency is a sign of Apocalypse, and they might be really upset. Although, you'd think the end of the world and the 1000 years of peace that are supposed to follow would be considered a good thing. LOL! I dunno.
vk1TcfTeaa	I have felt this way. It sounds like you're depressed and seaching. I think many if not most people experience this. Currently, I'm pretty happy with myself and my life. I have struggled with depression in the past (off and on for over 5 years), but my boyfriend has greatly encouraged me over the past year. I have also taken time to read my bible and attend church. Spiritual wellness is often ignored, but it's central to everything we do. It's how we look at life and interpret the things that happen to us. I had a lot of bitterness toward people who hurt me and also toward myself for making some really bad decisions in the past. I'm learning to let go and forgive myself. I'm finding joy by finding meaning in my life. Some other things I do to find happiness... exercise, eat healthier, encourage others.     It's amazing, it really is true, if you give what you want to get... you are truly rewarded. I was so lonely for so long until I realized I wasn't being a friend to anyone. I'm investing more time and energy in my relationships that I have and trying to create more. It brings me joy as I care about people beyond myself.    If you are doing all of these things, then maybe you should talk to your doctor about possibly getting some medication for depression. I believe depression is real and it affects us not only emotionally, but also physically.    ps- i also think music helps A LOT. find something upbeat, with a positive message.|`|lYgFyjw0aa	i just have high self confidence. i'm not the happiest person you'll meet but i know how to cheer myself up. listen to some good music or watch a movie/show you like. joke sometimes! that usually puts a smile on everyones face.|`|zZY3JX30aa	Very happy.

How do I know? I've been there and am still currently struggling with it. Everything in my life is perfect yet I still have problems sometimes of wanting to fall back in that rut but I can't. It will destroy a person if you let it. I try to surround myself with people that make me laugh and that I have a good time with. I don't know if you're religious or not but I am and I find that praying and reading me bible helps as well. Find some good upbeat music too.Those are a few things that help me.
nXPJ6d7eaa	Lol dude, we are organic beings, not a process or object to be mastered, manipulated and bent to your will! How can you think that this will work for everyone anyway?! Would it work for a guy with an elbow growing out of his forehead too?! All he has to do is put on some act and he's automatically got the interest of some girl who wasn't interested previously?!    If you want to fool some girl into thinking you are something that you are not, just to get laid/find a gf, then you have some disappointment ahead, my friend.    Technique? Attraction between beings is natural. Don't turn it into some unnatural conquest, or you will have a string of these relationships before realising that you've been going about it the wrong way...    And getting instructions on 'how to act' is not going to help you if you want someone to like who you are, and not just what you do. I know it sounds cliched, tacky and tried, but you just gotta be you. What if you try this technique, but can never relax around the person because they think you're something you're not? You can't keep up that act forever, no matter what kind of actor you are. Without consequences, at any rate.     Good luck with that one...    PS - If you convince a girl that she is the most special thing in the world (as the poster above suggests), and you don't really believe that at all, isn't that just a relationship built on lies that DOESN'T guarantee not straying? How fair is that to the chick? Contrary to popular belief, people, relationships are not ALL about games and lies.|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	Im not sure if your looking for sex or a girlfriend but...

LSxBwiFSaa	Now THAT- is a GOOD Question!   :)   Ultimately- probably NOT. The PROBLEM with lying, is that in ANY given Situation, there is ALWAYS the potential that the"Lie" can trigger unintended consequences- than can result in the FAILURE of the "noble ends" one is trying to achieve. It's said the "road to Hell- is paved with good intentions..." And ALL too often, the First "step" down that "road"- is a Lie. So the Answer to your Question, is "No."   :(|`|76fYDbsCaa	No lying is never good for you.    "Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water."- Miguel de Cervantes      I know that sometimes you have to lie but any human being will respect the truth even if it hurts.Being frank and honest is the best way to tell someone anything.|`|GChWTGNiaa	Lying is never justified, but if it achieves your goals go ahead.

kLjLJKBUaa	what i think you should do, and i do this myself, is think about what you are lacking that would make you this better person, set that goal, and do it.     for me, i think i would feel much better about myself if i was in better shape, ive been exercising on a daily basis, lost a couple pounds so far, and i feel so much better.    so its really identify your personal problem, whats making you feel weak, whats killing your confidence? fix that and you will feel better.
CT8pwhM5aa	I experienced this and have had several years (since the first episode) to contemplate the why and how.    Expect the meltdowns -- meaning, when one happens, realize this is normal. It would be better if you never had to see him again, but as it is, there's the internet.     You are not alone. The feelings of helplessness and a loss of control may return when you come across memory cues. The rage (if you are like me) is an emotional response to the helplessness, a survival mechanism both unconscious and subconscious --   -- "I am never going to let that happen again," "I never want to live through that again," "I want to live and trust, really trust again," "I hate myself for letting that happen," "I don't want to ever feel that way" --  oscillating thought patterns that may not even be consciously processed if you learn to ignore those thoughts like I did for a time. The scratching is an analog to you either instinctively fighting back feelings or memories, toughening yourself up, punishing yourself, or channeling anger.    Your brain sorts it out when you sleep, and the adrenaline has subsided, leaving you to your own calm and rational self.     It may help to read up on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and think of this incident as a PTSD episode, and the picture you saw as a trigger.     It helps me to think really loving thoughts toward my past self or inner child, and to minimize exposure to known triggers.|`|oYoRlRsKaa	I was 14 and raped by 3 men. No you never get over it. The smallest of things will put you in a meltdown. I get through it by imagining what I would do to them now. How I would make them suffer for what they did to me. I will hate for the rest of my life and I will always be in pain for what was taken from me including my ability to have children. Pray and know that you are special in Gods eyes|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I've never been raped, but I have had three men hold me at gun point during a robbery.  I feel for you.  That scene still goes thru my mind years later.      The first three weeks were absolute he!!, but I spent time in therapy and got over it pretty well.    Memories are just that.  Memories.  They will haunt you always.  The good ones and the bad ones.  What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.    My husband lost his arm in a machine back in 77 when he just turned 18.  His father watched.  He lives his pain every day, but has overcome the mental side of it.  The worst day in his life is every 10 year anniversary of that day.  I can't even hear the whole story.  It gives me nightmares.    My friend Bubba (RIP) was in Nam.  He worked thru his pain with alcohol.  He was as old as my husband when he died.  Can't imagine what he went thru, either.    I have meltdowns just going thru menopause.  It's perfectly normal, but you should call a friend to comfort you next time you feel one coming on.  I'm sorry for your tragedy, but we all have our own crosses to bear.|`|de14HtA9aa	I'm sorry for what you was put through.  I think that someone who experiences something like rape never really gets over it.  It's like a wound that never fully heals really.  I'm guessing the reason you had a meltdown was by seeing his picture that brought back all the nightmarish memories all back at once ( especially when you said you put what happend out of your thoughts really trying to carry on with your life ).  I can say if you have a personal walk/relationship with God than that might help with the healing process.
YwE5kIB8aa	Thats quite a thought provoking question.  I'd say i'd take respect.  And i'd say I do understand respect better than love.  Plus if there was no respect then I would question if there was love.  You can't make someone love you, but you can demand respect.  You can also make people respect you.  Plus there's many different kinds of love you can recieve; wife, parents, children, dog etc.  edit-to guy below, I don't agree with you about respect being wanted because one needs to be admired.  It means your appreciated, it means your valued, but not necessarily in a better stature than someone else.  And why does showing respect not have anything to do within a  nurturing relationship.|`|oCHaJc49aa	I see one Feminist troll crept in.    Um, the question of respect versus "something else" seems to me to be simplistic. The word "respect" is overused. What the heck does it (nowadays) mean? It used to mean one thing, now it seems to mean nothing more than a sort of vague feeling that you won't annoy someone.    The dictionary is no help:  Respect:    esteem for or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability: I have great respect for her judgement.     deference to a right, privilege, privileged position, or someone or something considered to have certain rights or privileges; proper acceptance or courtesy; acknowledgment: respect for a suspect's right to counsel; to show respect for the flag; respect for the elderly.     the condition of being esteemed or honored: to be held in respect.    The thesaurus does a little better:    Synonyms:  adoration, appreciation, approbation, awe, consideration, courtesy, deference, dignity, esteem, estimation, favor, fear, homage, honor, obeisance, ovation, recognition, regard, repute, reverence, testimonial, tribute, veneration, worship    It is true that being constantly questioned about one's motives is a real annoyance, and having a hostile cross-examination from one's wife / partner is a positive humiliation.     Perhaps the question should be better phrased "Would it not be better for the wifey to stop denigrating her husband and slagging him off in front of his friends?"     Why, YES.     But the Feminists have trained modern women to do exactly that, all the while demanding that the man "respect" (meaning: leave unquestioned) the woman.     Can't have it both ways.     Feminists: if you don't GIVE respect (to men), why should you expect to GET it (from men)?|`|rpajoT0raa	RE your last last comment:  -----------------------------  "The Bible (God) says that women are commanded to give unconditional respect. And because men desire respect more than love (examine yourself) then it's not against nature either. In fact it's BECAUSE it's not against nature that God made the commandment."  -----------------------------    Now who REALLY said that?? GOD or a MAN?  I am a human being with just as much right to survival. When a man is acting like an out of control moron, putting my future at risk and being an immoral fool, then I will lose respect for him and leave him. Unconditional Love be Damned. No stupid commandment from a fantasy book is going to make me risk my survival and integrity, or that of any children, if he can't make himself worth it.   :-)|`|NYU37jfGaa	I've often heard this but I am not sure that it is true as far as my husband is concerned.  While he certainly does want respect, and is happier when he gets it, I think love is very important to him too.  He tells me he loves me quite a lot, and quite frequently asks me if I love him.  Love seems to be very important to him as well as respect.    Saying 'I love you' isn't something I've ever gone in for much, because gushing protestations of love have always slightly embarrassed me, but I do make an effort to say it more often nowadays, because it does seem to make him happy.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I have to disagree with one point. I'm a woman and I need respect more than I need love. The latter is just a nice fringe benefit.|`|fN4fpRntaa	i support this idea because not many men that i know of prefer to be told they are caring sympathetic beings while being kissed over knowing he's alpha male. hmmm could this respect issue be due to ego complications and feel like no one sees them as important? important enough to be loved? any who, the chances i will hear my buddies talking to me about their sentiments and relationship with their wives is fairly slim, but what about gay men? including myself, gay men typically advocate for a more nurturing, loving relationship than that of total respect. gah, now i dont know where i stand on this issue..  right, straight men and their female partners. so like i said, men want respect because they feel like they need to be admired, or be seen as the protector in the relationship. im almost certain most men would be uncomfortable knowing it's the female in their relationship who gets to wear the pants, so to speak. there are exceptions to women whom do not necessarily prefer love , but for the most part, i believe women want to be loved because they are admired for all the virtues being a women might be.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Just a random thought.   You cant love someone without respect.  but you can respect someone without love.|`|CY9gpQCIaa	Love.    A woman will do much more for love than respect - unless she has cause for disappointment...    Unconditional love is nobel... unconditional respect is wrongfully against God and Nature.    Dude... What tha @ %!|`|gZXQ7jxCaa	Actually I think both genders need equal respect and love regardless of what a book says.  What makes marriages work is if there is a mutual partership with mutual respect and trust.  Men need to be loved by their wives as much as they need to be respected and women need to be respected by their husbans as much as they need to be love so forget about what a book says.  I know men and women are different in many ways and some of their needs may differ accordingly but respect and love should be eqaully applied for the two genders in any relationship.      I also disagree that wives should always respect unconditionally know matter what because if they husband does something disreptful towards his wife or mistreats her in anyway he isn't entitled to have her respect and vice versa.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	First, as a Pagan I reject the idea that such a choice must be made, in my experience for a relationship to work there must be both on both sides.  I would also argue that if it was in women's nature to behave in the manner you describe there would have been no need for the Biblical God to make a commandment to that effect, it would have been instinctive.  It's only because it's against human nature to be accept such restrictions that they have to be imposed and enforced by human actions.

Or, they're hiding their inner feelings toward each other to avoid conflict. But they're venting it out on you.     That's negative and selfish of them, but girls are delicate and spiky creatures. They have defense mechanisms but are weak to criticism and negativity.     The fact that both girls use you as a sounding board makes you an indirect moderator. You are sorting out how to respond. You may feel you need to vent yourself, or that you shouldn't have to listen to them when they can resolve their own problems if they choose to.     You have two choices: tell them something back, or don't tell them. Speaking up means confrontation, which causes conflict but is a good skill to learn (although earlier is not necessarily better). Listening but not responding honestly is what the other girls are doing in this situation, which is fine as long as everyone is fine with that. It won't be that way forever, though. It is a natural human response to feel slighted when someone treats them differently to avoid hurt feelings and conflict. You should decide to do what you feel is right while minimizing hurt toward others.
n9WBgOUlaa	Women have some parts of the dating game hugely stacked in their favor but they don't ever stop to think about it. For males, its quite difficult to get a date since they pretty much are expected to make every advance and more likely to get rejected countless times before being successful. Its a double standard that feminists/women secretly keep to themselves, I'm not sure if its because they want it all or simply because they've never been in a man's shoes. Either way, nobody likes a whiner specially when all they focus on is how "hard" they have it but never consider the other party.    As a guy, I don't have everything in my favor but I don't complain and demand the whole world change for my petty grievances.|`|jX7Bt0iBaa	Tommy........why don't you just give up figuring women out and start sleeping with men?

Why am I not surprised there aren't any feminists chiming in?  HAHAHAH!  Come on "ladies" speak up!    To answer the question... because it's easier to focus on the negative.  They want to have their cake and to eat it too.  They want free love, but they don't want to be labeled s lut.    It's human nature though.  Don't blame them for it.  Love them for it.    The male version of s lut is... male.  Isn't it obvious?    EDIT: dam I shouldn't have answered... Tommy doesn't EVER EVER EVER EVER pick a best answer.  Clearly a troll.

In theory there is supposed to be free love where women can have sex with and date whoever they want , but in the end, men get to play the field while women can sometimes end up getting used.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	Positive and negative are perceptions, dear.

Surely there are better things you could do with your time.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I have completely given up trying to  understand modern sexual mores.  You get questions from women complaning about being labeled sluts etc, and then you get questions fromother women complaining that they are being pressurised into having sex, people think they're weird for wanting to remain virgins etc.  It really does my head in, and I have given up trying to understand it.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	Many of them are lazy, just like men.

Get the OCD treated, and move on with your life.|`|WmIU5pSRaa	I agree that it's useless to complain, but consider this:    It is much more likely to get a job as a teacher if you are male - the principles seem to think that boys in particular benefit from male role models.  When a woman "sleeps around", she is labelled a **** and looked down on. When a man "sleeps around", he is called a player and congratulated.  It is much less likely for male shop assistants to exchange items (especially electronics, I've noticed) unless a man is either making the exchange or with the woman.  Those two things I have noticed in the last two months alone. There are more, but I can't be stuffed at the moment.    More positive sexual attention? Not always a good thing. And where did you get the idea that women have an easier time attracting suitors? It isn't like there is suddenly an abundance in men - the ratio hasn't changed much.    Your last paragraph makes less than no sense. You won't often hear me complaining about the positives :) I see an improvement in the way women are treated, but we're still not completely equal. Men still have the distinct advantage in the workplace at least. It's a start, though; we'll get there in the end.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	I agree with you sir.|`|G1kdupY3aa	Sexuality standards?

qsqmykzsaa	You are doing ok. All you can do is your best.  Life throws many things at many of us.    I had a drunk for a mother, married  at 18, had 5 kids by 29.  My 4th baby a boy, died at age 4 months from cot death.    At age 40, hubby died playing tennis, I still had 3 kids at home.    Re-married 3 years later, miscarried at 15 weeks.    Hubby was good. Eleven years later, he had bowel cancer. I nursed him for a year. he died in my arms at home.  After no work for a year, I had to declare myself bankrupt. Didn't want to. Lost my home.  All of these events were very traumatic.  They say "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger".  Well, I must be strong.    Just do the best you can.|`|ZoAEoHl9aa	kicked out of the house at 17  my wife had our first kid when i was 19  stop college   live anywhere and everywhere  wife had our son when i was 21  still lived from place to place   job to job   and now steady job for 4 years that pays our bills  and fixing to move to our house   "not much just a lil 3 bedroom 2 bath"   it was hard when i was younger but we made it and now i look at it as a stepping stone don't worry its gets easier sometimes  i am sure i will have more bumps in the road but this time i am hopefully more ready for it     it just life ha ha     good luck|`|GimlPXTqaa	yyy|`|DQOnfhoLaa	you have overcome the greatest fear of it all ,(not to blame yourself for your shortcomings), which means you have passed the first test.everybody has a low period in their life.regarding me it was the weight problem which led me to overeat and i just couldn't play with my kids.i then looked into myself (a self introspection) and it helped a lot.the problem was not eating but what lead me to eat.I had this desire to be the perfect wife and mom and that left me exhausted.and for comfort i turned to food.

6GmtcZteaa	LOL ! for the first part I would just like to say that's normal. Every one has his different persoanilty, and you like to solve things hmm ;).  And I also agree with you on the part where atheists here are super rude, I think they just couldn't convince anyone there is no good so they go on yahoo and curse everyone around them. As for the super catholics that is wrong too, someone should over hyper himself in such matters, if you would like to believe their is a god and would like to tell people about it then that's fine, we well listen. If you don't believe their is a god and would like to tell people about it, we might also listen.But don't come on here cursing people and mocking them and their beliefs, it's wrong.

It really ticked me off and it stuck with me for about an hour.  It still ticks me off when I think about it.  Telling myself SHE'S the idiot makes me feel better to some degree.  As far as your concern with others' opinions, they are just that, their opinions.  They mean nothing.  They are not necessarily correct.  I make a point not to talk religion with people because it makes me too upset.|`|aV0Dx5Lyaa	You have been allowed in early days to explain too much. May be you are a teacher or may not or may it had been earlier. Another possibility you might have been in search of ego. It is difficult for you to calm down and concentrate because the tranquility and equilibrium level required for it doesnot come in a day. In fact you require a lot of practice and that too in a regular manner-I give you the fields. Wake up a bit early, go for physical excercises to allow your body get tired. Keep busy in anthing you find of your interest. Allow a hobby to be developed for the later days of your life. And then, you are a very happy person. What to care for ? What to fear from ? and above all for what to explain when everything is nothing but simply a tiny jwell of HIS crown. Why to explain on something when we are not the CREATOR. Ultimately ideas are born in our minds only on the basis of our status among the environment, physical stregnth, and or in one word - NATURE. Hence, whatever continue to trouble you in mind is nothing but simply an act of NATURE occuring in you due to your being away from it. BE HAPPY, GOD BLESS YOU. Now see, when ideas are born in your mind, only when you are not asleep. When you are sleeping, only when your mind(Materialistically as a part of body) and body gets tired and you are not in their total control, right. So, allow them to be tired in their own way. Don't even mind what mind is doing. The more physical labour you would do viz playing, going to Gym, etc., the less your mind will allow to occupy the foolishness, though it cannot even be coming to you without the willingness of nature. Yes, you may not overpower God, but, at least turn NATURE by turning your own nature and in turn God will come to know your problem. Believe me, GOD cannot allow its creature to be unhappy as HE has the only cause HAPPINESS for which human species are allowed to prevail. What Catholics, what religion, nothing. Everything comes after GOD and not before it. Yes, after GOD, and after NATURE. When then, your number comes? You are in a queue, please wait.. will be the only response if you keep crying. Better adopt the path of physical labour to reach the destination. BE HAPPY.
tPrXVjX7aa	Probably not, because it's subjective...  Most IQ tests are based on academics, but other factors play into role.    Autism is a good example, for instance, a person might be highly intelligent with say math, and has no interpersonal relationship abilities, this may render this person completely nonfunctional in the "real world".  Another person could be practically an "analphabet", but have so high social-skills (social IQ) that they could make it very far in their life.|`|pWl7SHjTaa	to a point, yes. however, there are quite a few limitations and problems with the way IQ is measured. Intelligence quotient tests can be affected by a number of things, such as culture, socioeconomic status (to a point, because some kids growing up in the projects are just as intelligent as kids growing up in well-to-do neighborhoods, but answer the questions in a way that results in less points because that's what they know and the answer key doesn't control for that all the time), your fluent language, etc. There are also many different tests of intelligence - the good ol' Binet test, the Gardner scale, the birmingham multiple intelligences test, etc., which all base "intelligence" on different aspects. IQ is merely an operational definition by psychologists and others in like fields of intelligence. But, overall, IQ is accepted as being an accurate measure because they can't really find a better way to measure it. however, an upside is that they are getting better at controlling for the things stated above. so they are at least more accurate than they used to be.|`|UDl8Ac76aa	I don't think so. I've tried several times, when my mood is good my IQ is good too, but when I am down, the IQ is a little low. My friend's IQ is quite high, but she cheated when IQ test and no one notice, but 75% of the class members cheated and shared the same answer, and they got the same IQ. ^ ^
O8zOZzO6aa	Dear StAr, allow me to give you some tips.  If you cannot look people in the eye, it is an indication that you have some inferior feelings. Like you feel you do not match up to the other person. This may have been caused by some bad experience or incident in your younger days.    Never mind what had happened. You have to STOP feeling low or inferior. Look straight into the eyes of the person you talk to. For starters, try talking to your good, close friends or family members. Do not look away from their eyes. Slowly you will overcome the shyness to look people in the eye. Remember, good eye contact is vital in any form of conversation.    Then, you can begin using "Body Language" while communicating with a person. You'll find you are more at ease and not shy with the person.|`|Gn6NOksmaa	talk to yourself in the mirror everyday or something|`|YFRlATJSaa	Remember that no one knows you're shy until you let them know.

It also will help if you have a close friend with you.|`|RJGsih1vaa	There is an old technique that many people use to help gain motivation and overcome shyness, it is called assdimes.  Everyday you shove as many dimes up your *** as you can, and buy as many things as you can with them.

Well you can get rid of shyness in many ways. First think you need is """"TRUST"""is not about trusting other people is about trusting your-self. You need to believe in your self. Because shy is kinda like a stone that tied on you legs. They slow you down from being successful. I think the best way you can get rid of shyness is to get some crazy fun n exciting friends who always loyal to you are support you. Second you need to do many things. Like joining a sport team, joining a club, doing volunteer. Force your self to do it. The most important thing is you had to believe in your-self. I was kinda shy just like you a couple months ago. But after that i starts joining club,sport teams, and do many other things with my friends. and thats how i overcome my shyness??|`|insgsbiEaa	haha im just ammused by bretts answer!!! i dont recommend doing what he said but its pretty funny.

nRFZwdN4aa	Don't have much to do with them, if sufficient evidence proves that they are lying. If you are absolutely sure they are lying, just stay away from them.     Meanwhile, concentrate on yourself. You know you are being honest, so you are staying clean. The others are just cheating themselves.     On a more general note, dealing with liars is hard. One thing I never do (if i strongly suspect someone is lying...but it is about themselves) is call them on it. I just have nothing to do with them because they can't be trusted. Hanging out with a liar (even though you -know- they lied) just reinforces their behavior. Even if you tell them they're lying, it's moot cos they will just continue the lies to your face, because you 'know' about it and still hang around them.|`|zZY3JX30aa	Lie to them|`|Q5KFND17aa	People lie for many reasons. And if you're LYING about how skilled you are at staying clean, you dont have an ego problem, instead you have a self esteem problem...otherwise you wouldnt have to pretend to be better than others to feel good.    all you can do is feel sorry for them, dont trust them, and keep them out of your life as much as possible.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	As one recovering person to another, don't let their games affect your recovery.

I try to say it to them straight up. *Youre lying.   *No need to lie.   *Were all friends here, we're all addicts.   *you don't need to compete with each other.  * we're here to support, not to judge you. its alright to tell the truth    etc.   just remember. lying is part of the disease. when only drugs matter, lying to others, even yourself (denial) is quite common. be patient.

oB5aKIOOaa	Generalized Anxiety Disorder has a long list of symptoms that I'm not going to get into, but being a sufferer of Anxiety, it's easiest to label anxiety as exactly what it sounds like. Anxiousness towards places, people, or situations. While, in general, it's normal to feel some anxiety, i.e. right before you have to do a public speech or perform on stage, high levels of anxiety deal more with detrimental levels of anxiety towards situations outside of the range of 'normal'.     More often than not if anxiety is not dealt with, either through psychotherapy, exercise, or some other form it tends to lead to panic attacks, which in short are feelings of the world ending.     No fun, but there is plenty of help and it's not the most devastating mental disorder around.|`|0AyH9jdxaa	hyper|`|vTs0oeKKaa	The culminating effect that builds and builds into a softened , frazzled panic of not being able to control that which we fear.
zZY3JX30aa	Nope. Jealousy is a wasted emotion. It is an emotion of selfishness and self-importance. There is nothing on this Earth to be jealous of, ever...at least for me.|`|sxo9dznQaa	I try not to be because its a sin to be jealour, but I can be one. People who are better than me at things get me jealous and people who like the same person I like. Yes, I have thought to myself that my jealousy was rediculous, and it was. Too much jelousy is when you start doing things about it, like being a b*tch to the person who likes the same person you like. When I make someone jealous, I feel good, but I know I have done something bad, and may have created drama.|`|SWihEymOaa	I hate to say it, but yes. Hey, I'm 13, and it's a popular emotion for 13 year olds) I hate jeasousy- it's a waste of space of an emotion, it's powered by selfishness, and nothing good EVER comes out of it.    I'm doing good with controling it though, and I don't get jealous as much as. :) I never act out of jealousy, and I treat people just as I would if I wern't jealous. Plus, it give me an oppertunity to compliment people. :)    People say a little bit of jealousy is a good thing, because it drives you to do better. But imo, isn't that kinda a crappy inspiration??    The problem is, I NEVER LET THINGS GO. I may be able to repel, ignore, and forget about jealousy, but it's possible for it to come back, and when/if it does, it will drive me crazy.    My friend & I had our friendship ruined (well not really ruined, but ignored) because we were both jealous of each other... luckly I got over it & worked on fixing it. :)    Honestly, I can't stand it when people are jealous of me... Not kidding. In my opinion, it's a worse feeling than being jealous. It's hard to explain, and it makes me like super-humble and I feel a need to put myself down. Like being jealous, this kills my self confidence. :( It takes a lot for me to build that up.    I won't even bother touching the fact that it makes me feel like s*** for making someone feel like that. It's never my intention...|`|ECECM57waa	I'm not a terribly jealous person normally, but when I'm stressed out or upset for a long time, lots of little things eat at me, especially jealousy.  Feeling unwanted makes me jealous.  When I'm in a terrible mood, watching really happy people pisses me off and makes me a little jealous.  Sometimes later I think "that was ridiculous".  I think a little jealously is okay, it shows that you care.  When it makes you or someone else unhappy, I think it's too much, but everyone has those moments, and I think they're completely forgivable.    When I make someone jealous, I usually feel bad because it isn't ever what I meant to do.|`|CU1WRghVaa	Jealousy, okay looking at other people and wanting the things that you don't have  from them such as look, rich,wealth.family, relationship, and knowledge. If you are truly a human being you will always get jealous of at least something. Jealousy is good. But if you have too much jealousy then it became negatively bad in someway that will damage you life|`|yOeLBIPaaa	I used to get very Jealous but I think that was just a teenage phase.    Although I still get jealous when someone is better at me when in Art classes because I love art and want to make a career out of it so when someone else gets a compliment that little green eyed monster roars but I take it in my stride and also compliment that persons work.    I'm also a bit of a loner even though I have many friends, too many infact, I just prefer to spend my spare time alone or with my bestfriend who prefers not to go out (I like going out, but by myself) and so when some one makes plans with her I do get a little jealous because we might not be as close as other bestfriends but its the closest relationship I have ever had and I don't want to lose it to someone else. Its the one thing that keeps me grounded and a lot of the time it can't even stop me going into my own little world.|`|6A0GkXXjaa	uh, yeah, I think I am, I spend an awful lot of time just envying people who are smarter, rich, talented, thin, e.t.c.., it's not good, but that's just the way I am right now, my self esteem is sh*t.|`|bb18xShnaa	yes. I think we all are at some stage. Its just some people let it get the better of them. I try to control mine. But i also find it fuels me; like it fuels me to make myself work harder to get what the other person has if not more/better. Its shallow and hollow i know. I just think we should control our jelousy so that it doesnt jeapordise our relationships.|`|c3h3qgNpaa	wen i make sum1 jealous i feel well gud=D

Well that's what I think.|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	I think that more often than not, the unavailability of one party is necessary for the obsession to take hold.      If there are exceptions, I'd sure hate to be around those two lol.    ADDED:  Needler, I promise I'll think harder about your response, but in short, if I am obsessed with every little thing in your life, and you are obsessed with every little thing in my life, there really is no one left to be leading a meaningful life.|`|28c9eb0b801c2374bd219860f12425b9aa	A whole lot of disaster there my friend!

Hope that helps|`|qXiuDkzxaa	I imagine they'd get engaged or they may end up hating each other because they'd never get room to breathe with the other person constantly around, obsessing. I think they'd most likely end on a very bad note. People have gotta have space.|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	think in terms of celebrities. it starts from infatuation from afar. normal.    then it gets more extreme. taking their pictures watching their movies constantly... writing fan letters etc. the trouble happens when they become obsessed and end up meeting/confronting the object of their obsession. the admiration from afar turns to jealousy and wanting to be best friends etc. Lots of these people resort to murder.     think of selena.  also another celeb starlet who was killed. I forget her name...he wrote her letters and she never answered...he showed up on her doorstep & she got scared and asked him to leave so he killed her.    google some thing like "celebrity obsession turned to murder" etc|`|7OsQ9uHEaa	I'm guessing it'll result in a whole lot of riot 24/7.  If being obsessed with someone means you would want that person to be around you all the time, with no room to breathe or be around other people or at least do something else than what you do with that person, multiply it by 2, it's like a bomb waiting to explode. How else can 2 people grow? They will end up hating each other when one does something and the other does not do the same thing to the other. It's like exchanging shots, hurling epithets, what have you. Obsession isn't good whether by one person towards another or by 2 people towards each other. Not good any which way you put it. Someone will always end up hurt.
qXiuDkzxaa	The truth may mess you up for the moment but wondering about a lie messes you up for life.    Always the truth, it's better to know than wonder.|`|CU1WRghVaa	well it depends. I learned that lies are not always bad. Most people believe and culture believe lying is one of the most deadly since? idk but the think that i know is lying can sometime be a good time too. Like covering up the bad things so you can live on with you life. so I mean okay, would you rather like to heard that you dog is death or you dog run aways. Of course i would like to heard that my dog run away so there is a still chance for the dog to live. and That help you still live on with your life i think. Those are the lies that avoid you from getting harm. yes of course theres are so many different lies, like the lies that harm you and get things out from you.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	I do much better with the truth, even when it's difficult.  Too many people play games and make dishonesty a regular part of their relationships.  They will say they lie to keep from hurting others, but in reality I believe people lie to keep their own butts out of a sling for a little while.  Lies always catch up with you too and you have to always keep track of what you have said to whom.  Give me the truth any day.|`|28c9eb0b801c2374bd219860f12425b9aa	When the truth is spoken even though it may cause pain it will heal and hopefully you'll gain something positive  about it!

83c15412024c532d9615f4d006e286f0aa	Monetary policy controls a recession and inflation by setting how much money is supplied in an economy.    When an economy is in a recession the central bank will typically increase the money supplied which will help reduce interest rates; increasing spending.  When inflation is a problem, the central bank will typically decrease the money supply, which will increase interest rates; slowing spending.

I have tried to convince myself that I should just be content with taking care of myself and my loved ones-problem is I love humanity and want to see it progress to better, healthier things than what I see today.  One thing to remember is that all great historical figures brought to light ideas that were incredibly controversial for their time.  There will always be people telling you it can't be done. But what I tell myself is that if it cannot be done, than why do I believe, regardless of what I am shown, that it can be done.

Different cultures "define" that personal space concept at different distances and for varying social situations.  Most people just seem to absorb the boundaries without needing to be told, and to back away when they are invaded.    As far as looking over your shoulder, I think most people are very uncomfortable about that too.  In fact, it seems even worse, because you feel obliged to say something, as if you need to explain or justify what you are doing, or  as if you've invited them to participate.

No woman, goes to work in her Malono Blahnik shoes ! No smart and pretty woman, financially independent, finds a man in a Bar so easy like cockroaches! It's all Hollywood !!

The hardest part is getting started.|`|CT8pwhM5aa	Procrastination is common and can be overcome. Asking "why?" is part of the procrastination cycle, but it is a valid question. You may have other things going on than work at the end of the day, but if you're like me, you don't have a driving force to get that last thing done. You either don't want to do the work itself or you don't want to do whatever it is that you would do if you finished up faster. Sit around until workday is done? Make the journey home? Deal with other drivers/people? Cook dinner? Decide what to eat? Do laundry or clean house? Nothing? Procrastination is like an obsessive compulsion borne out of adversity. Something there is you don't like about you or your life.    Or it just a learned habit from another time.

IsJKC75Maa	It is called insubordination, and there are repercussions.  As soon as you show up for school you are considered to be under the school's care - a ward of the institution.  The school has rules in this regard, including procedures for these types of 'unethical' experiments.    While you will all receive sanctions to some degree, the leader may be expelled.    I would not do it.    The students cannot work-to-rule in a civil society institution like a public high school because there is no direct payment from students or parents (public schools are funded through taxation).  The teacher's get paid regardless of whether their students show up or not.  If students fail to show up in the long term, the class is cancelled, the school is closed, government saves on social spending, and the community suffers.    This WOULD work at a private school or university, and would have a watershed effect from the grad students, sessionals, and profs teaching the classes to department heads, deans, and administrative staff because even if they are unionized, the univeristy cannot pay staff without student revenue, and the staff cannot pay union dues without a paycheck.    So wait a while.  ; )|`|YuAmsQL3aa	yes, They can and will hold you back, or force you to "make up" the lost day(s). As state laws require so much attendance with a passing grade, in order to graduate or move to a higher grade level.    So unless its extreme serious, don't do it. Everyone has to do their time, whether they like it or not. It's your future you are playing with.... you only have to put up with school for a short time.|`|L3L1rkTdaa	i think that this would not be as effective as they would hope, because kids are beginning to overestimate their ability to change teachers' minds with strikes and /or petitions, stuff like that. For example, every single girl in my grade at school signed a petition to get seat covers in the girls' bathroom, and it never happened. They could punish all of you, but not through suspension or anything like that, maybe just by detention and demerits.|`|PSIHAIxwaa	Interesting idea. It could work if you asked the principle/administration for permission first (without telling your teacher). Maybe if you had endorsement from your school's psychology teacher, the administration *might* consider it. But that would be very difficult.  The teacher would feel like she had lost control and probably hate your class for the rest of the year. The administration could definately punish all of you. By collective behavior standards, though, in a class of 20-35 people, it is highly unlikely that all of them would agree to participate.|`|47592a6344e5ad19f1ef5e8d1c9ca998aa	It would not be effective. They don't care. They barely care about what the parents have to say. I think all of the kids in the class would be in trouble, possibly detention or something.|`|2PlJEJzQaa	I can tell you this much...it would work. No students = no teaching...the teachers are the minority ruling the majority, leaving the classroom is something I think about in my english class...I don't know if you people realize this but students could rule the school if they feel like it. No students would = no school; no school = no teachers; teachers would be worried about their own position if you do this...but you would have to be willing to take the punishment...as Gandhi and MLK Jr did.|`|XPKRPHW2aa	most likely their would be a retest or the class would fail the test. the leader would be frowned upon by the classmates. worst case is that the whole class repeats 10th grade.    good luck!
YuAmsQL3aa	yep..... things that appeal to me one minute, just don't do it the next minute.  I will find clothes with tags on it, years later and wonder why i bought it in the first place.  As far a food is concerned, we have many people living in the house, so if i buy it, it will get eaten. (sooner or later).|`|2540beea71f086c933fed7bd808e72c8aa	Not with clothes,  but I do that with groceries.  By the time I get out of work, I don't want to cook, soooo  fast food it is.

9be6374e78d68c69f3c0e6a68f547775aa	Generally, it pisses people off either because (A) they are insecure because they know they're kind of stupid and, in assuming they know nothing, you're pointing out that you know they're stupid; or (B) they are very smart and even smarter than you so it's insulting that an ignoramus like you is daring to presume to know more than they know.    If the person is approximately your intellectual equal, they might cut you some slack by empathizing about how many people they've had to deal with in their lives that didn't know a thing and how, the few times they started with the expectation that the other person knew the basics, it came back later to bite them in the @ss.

It may be insulting to me depending on my mood, but it can also educational on my part.  When teacher approaches a class, I believe they approach their students in the same manner, then they teach them what they need to know.  I think the most harmful thing you can do to another human being is treating them as though they didn't matter or that they were worthless, that would be so much worse.

vog7TVFgaa	everyone has something special. keep searching|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Don't we all feel this way.  The funny thing is that we don't always see our talents.  I can look at every one of my sibblings and see what God called them to do, but I had no idea what I was good at.  One thing you can do is ask your friends and family what they think you are good at, you might be surprised at thier answers.  Ask them what they think your talents are or what they think you would be when you grow up.  You don't have to choose something because they say it, but it might give you something to work with.  I always thought my younger sister should have been a school teacher.  She runs a day care, helps out in her kids schools, and bakes wedding cakes.  So she uses different talents.  Maybe you have a talent in art, but you need to take more classes to develope it more.  Maybe a class in photography would develope a skill you already have and don't realize it.  I always wanted to be a writer, and while I never wrote the great novel, I wrote many training programs in my life, and I trained a lot of people to do a lot of different skills.  Ask the people around you what they think you are good at, others are better at seeing what we are good at.  I was at the vets a few months back and a comment by a stranger made me see that I had a skill training dogs.  I never realized that, eventhough I had trained many dogs in my life.  I had trained many dogs, and assumed that because I could train a dog, everyone could.  I didn't see this skill until a stranger pointed it out to me.  You have skills, you just don't see them.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	If you are indeed a pubescent, don't get overwhelmed by the emotions triggered by hormonal swings...just embrace the emotion,experience it, then let it go...it will pass  Then know:  Things happen in their own time.

I eventualy found out that if was so interested in something it didn't matter that at first I was still so stupid no one spoke to me- the interest was enough to force me to do some work - either on an academic subject or something like enjoying reading or seeing films or dvds..    Talents do develop from interest.    and a keen interest and some knowledge in a specific topic or activity becomes an attractive aspect of anyones character.      Especially once you learn enough not to show off about how much you know but to be able to ask good questions of others who are interested in the topic.    But this is not an easy answer when you are in your present position  An easy quick fix would be so much better - but I don't know one.    Maybe asking questions even now might be possible  - Are there any other quiet people you know who might, once you start talking with them have a keen iterest in something they'd really like to talk about?|`|AA11626262	Throughout all of my teenage years, I never had the same talents or was in the same activities as the other kids were. I never played sports, I failed at every instrument I attempted to play and was never motivated enough to be in any after-school clubs. I couldn't sing or dance. I couldn't draw or paint or write poetry/stories. Not until my junior year did I care about taking a foreign language class (which I failed). It all didn't seem important to me and I figured when I grew up and was in the real world, those things wouldn't matter.    I'm not saying that you shouldn't ever pursue things, but for myself, I was right. I've never pursued anything as an adult that would have called for any of those things. Just focus on your schoolwork and soon, I promise that you're going to find what you're good at. I found that I really enjoyed history and geography, and language arts as well. I had something that none of my friends had... an interest in history. Sounds kinda boring, I know! It was what I found that I was good at and interested in though. Academics were what I paid attention to and it helps me succeed even today.|`|c4033d7ff37dd45e795d050261fee395aa	What is the point of having only 1 special talent? You probably have many special talents, but feeling down, you don't realise what they are.     There is a theory of Multiple Intelligences, proposed by Howard Gardner. He did not think that the IQ tests accurately measured the various talents and skills that people have. IQ tests are also culturally biased, which means that they don't take into consideration people's cultural background and different experiences. Multiple intelligence covers eight (or nine) various areas, from literacy, to music, to sport, to social and interpersonal knowledge. Your talent may lie outside the square i.e. outside the classroom walls. At your age it is best to broaden your horizons, try new things.     All I know is that the most interesting people in this world, have various jobs, experiences, they have travelled extensively, they have read widely and they have not limited themselves to a small number of areas they are perhaps talented in.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I feel that way too and I am 34.   but i believe that everyone has something special.  You have to get to know yourself better, explore yourself. Try for a week to be alone with yourself than you will discover some hidden talent that you never knew that you had because you are probably just to busy with school and friends.  I was about in my twenties when i discovered that i am good in drawing and writing and  I am good in astrology. i discovered that later in life perhaps because I was no longer in school.|`|U25RAqyoaa	I think I know how you feel. I am  sixteen and have no idea what I want to do once I get out of school and a lot of my friends already seem to know what they want in life. I don't really have that one special thing that I'm good at either. I just seem to be kind of ordinary I think. But I know that one day I am going to find something to do that will make me happy and you should too. I mean obviously try to think about it but I wouldn't fret too much. You will know what the right thing is when it comes along. Good luck and I hope that I helped you!|`|SvgYalNDaa	Why do you think you need a special talent? Depending on how old you are, maybe you just haven't found one yet. Either that or you might be like me, who's good at many things but not great at any of them. That means you can participate and do well in almost everything but not be a standout.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	it is there you will find your talent but not by crying|`|2aRv8GPMaa	You don't have to be amazing at something. I know how you feel, as I also used to feel sad about my apparent mediocracy. I realized that I wasn't great at any one thing, but I was pretty good at several things. I knew a little about everything, and it made me feel happy that I was a well rounded person.  Maybe you are pretty good at a few different things! If you are just worried about being recognized for something, like having a signature talent, you shouldn't be. You are a multi-faceted person, just like everyone else, and if you were an amazing dancer, for example, then that might be the only thing anyone knows about you, and to them you are just a dancing machine, not a person.  Instead, be the best you that you can. Take time to find yourself, to concentrate on the very core of your being and find internal harmony. I promise that if you can do that, and learn that you are not seeing your best qualities then you will have confidence in yourself and you won't want to hide behind a non-unique talent.

At the moment we're heading into a sort of Depression which is characterized by deflation - lower prices - no credit - nobody spends - people hoard money.  So far the big drops in prices have been oil and real estate - whether we'll see this with food I'm not sure.  A lot will depend on Obama's stimulus ideas - if they work or not - if the republicans allow them through.
teN7hu6Eaa	Well obviously it's mostly because you truly helped someone. But a major factor could be that you know that person isn't feeling any guilt or debt to you. For example, if you had a friend in real life who helped you out with something, you would feel obligated to pay them back and even maybe that you owe them some sort of debt.    When you answer a question here, you know that person isn't going to feel any obligation or guilt and truly be happy.     It is still mostly because we helped someone with a problem. It could also just be that you know you just earned 10 points. ;-)|`|O9OyQCB2aa	You know, it could be because you like helping other people when they either, don't know something or because you just want to help them.

c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	An article on Motley Fool claims that if the unemployment rate were determined as it was 80 years ago, we'd have 17.5 percent unemployment today.    http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=2...    I think any way you slice it, today's unemployment rate calculation system spews out lower numbers. Remember that back then, most women would probably not be counted as part of the work force. There's a lot more working women now.    Here's something from wiki that clarifies what *is* and what *isn't* counted in today's calculations.  "It is possible to be neither employed nor unemployed by ILO definitions, i.e., to be outside of the "labor force." These are people who have no job and are not looking for one. Many of these are going to school or are retired. Family responsibilities keep others out of the labor force. Still others have a physical or mental disability which prevents them from participating in labor force activities.    Typically, employment and the labor force include only work done for monetary gain. Hence, a homemaker is neither part of the labor force nor unemployed. Nor are full-time students nor prisoners considered to be part of the labor force or unemployment. The latter can be important. In 1999, economists Lawrence F. Katz and Alan B. Krueger estimated that increased incarceration lowered measured unemployment in the United States by 0.17% between 1985 and the late 1990s. In particular, as of 2005, roughly 0.7% of the US population is incarcerated (1.5% of the available working population).    Children, the elderly, and some individuals with disabilities are typically not counted as part of the labor force in and are correspondingly not included in the unemployment statistics. However, some elderly and many disabled individuals are active in the labor market." from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemploymen...|`|AA10719402	I've often wondered that myself.  It seems that type of data was collected by doing interviews and polls, but I'm uncertain as to what exactly they did.    The main form of data seems to be the "Historical Statistics of the United States".  I've never seen any other thing cited for unemployment.  Yea, there are some books out there (Lebergott) that state unemployment was much higher, but they didn't count those employed by the government.      I've never got my hands on a Historical Statistics, but I'm sure there would be some sort of description of data collection.    Oh man.. look how much it goes for on Amazon.  http://www.amazon.com/Historical-Statist...  Un-freaking-believable.  So much for transparent data.
JbJA6Gt6aa	IF you are taking an Anti-depressant and you are experiencing muscle twitches you should contact someone at the hospital. Twitches like these because of medication can become permanent. If it's something that you feel is wrong, you should certainly speak with your doctor about it. If you feel like they aren't taking you seriously get a second opinion. You shouldn't abrubptly stop taking any medication without the consent of your doctor. Be careful. ask for help.
hoIH8dAlaa	So much self analysis. Just as well, I guess.  I hope you recieve expert professional counselling over the issue of your fantasies..this needs attention, as of the violent nature. At least you recognise that you objectify women, and hopefully wish to rectify this...many men don't know and don't see the harm.  There IS hope, as you seem willing to be open and honest, which is valuable for recovery.  I am so sad your parents didn't see the looming danger involved with exposing you to porn! As many people certainly don't understand the tremendous long term harm it causes.    I shall paraphrase Katherine Hepburn, who said something like "We are each born with many closed doors, that are closed for good reason. When one of these doors is opened by us, it remains ajar, never  fully shutting again."  Self-esteem is a wonderful gift you can give yourself, as you heal.  Counselling styles vary, with your intensity and depth of analysis, you may overwhelm a less competent professional, you may need to try more than one, before you find the right help. (I suggest gestalt therapy, as it is wholistic and straight to the core.)|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	post draumatic stress disorder?|`|eNMRIKL6aa	After reading all this I would diagnose you as sexual deviant, narcissistic, and social anxiety. You probably are suffering from depression or anxiety. To be honest, I doubt if drugs or psychotherapy are always a good answer. Sometimes it's better to try and deal with whatever difficulties you are having in life. If you are having problems being successful with women, then maybe you need to learn more about that. If you are really open to therapy it might help. It might be good just to get a professional opinion of your mental state.
s3IBrhZCaa	its normal to be confused about life......especially at your age.    the only piece of advice i can give you is..........try and get into a career that you will not dread getting up in the morning going to.    i dont think you are going to be happy in an office monday thru friday 8am to 5pm at a desk.     do not be worried that you wasted your time and money getting a degree. it is a stepping stone to perhaps something better you want to do with your life.     it may take time. trial and error before you really know what you want to do.    make a list of things that are the most important to you in your life. money, relationsips, health, work hours, stress level, people person or non-people person, etc. etc. etc. Once you make this list......get into a career that would most likely fit the things that are most important to you. even if it means going back to college for new or for advanced training. and yes, it can be in a completely different thing than international business if you so choose.|`|u1vEj8DYaa	1. Finish your degree.  2. Work your butt off doing pretty much anything and save as much money as you can.  3. Buy a backpack, and spend a year travelling.  Go anywhere.  Work the vendage in the south of France (harvesting grapes), pick oranges in Greece, snag a gig working in a youth hostel somewhere (apply in advance).  If you're feeling especially brave travel in Asia (where things are really cheap).  Teach English in Korea or Japan (take an online course in TESL so you're qualified).  Whatetever, just get out and do it.    *If you suspect you're suffering from clinical depression I suggest you see your physician about it.  If you are in fact suffering from clinical depression the longer you leave it the more frequent and intense your depressive episodes will become.  Don't gamble with this, get it attended to asap.

So ?|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I think maybe if you were in a relationship, life wouldn't seem so bleak to you, honestly.    Most humans *need* love. If it's not a romantic love, then at least they need very close friendships. It's just a human thing, we're social animals, we *need* other people.    Doesn't make you weak or stupid or a follower to media hype, just makes you human, that's all.    Then after you're done with your day at your job being a slave to some corporation, you come home to the person you love, or to an empty house that's just as you left it if there's nobody else there, you go hang out with friends who make you happy and there you go. Boring, pointless life, with others in it who you enjoy, suddenly isn't so pointless any more.     If this makes no sense to you or doesn't feel right at all, then I'm not sure what to tell you.     If you think you could use some therapy, you probably can. You know yourself better than anyone else. Best luck! This sounds to me like it's just fear because you're leaving the security of school and moving to the next phase. It's scary for lots of us to jump into the unknown after being secure with where we've been. This, if this is what it is for you, is completely normal and will get better once you start the next phase in life and get comfortable and secure in it =o)|`|GZpwkL1Vaa	speaking of first hand expeirience, therapy isn't for everyone. I've had clinical depression for 4 years and therapy only made things worse for me. But i feel like it could be different for you, i don't like to open up and tell my most secret feeling to a complete stranger, but judging that you feel comfortable asking anyone out there willing to answer for help you probably have an easier time opening up to people. If you feel like you need someone to talk to and are comfortable with it therapy might be a good move. The one thing i've learned is you have to know what makes you happy to be happy, and it sounds easy but really isn't. The biggest thing that can help you when your confused is to find something to dedicate your life too. The one thing that helped me more than anything and i owe my life too is football. You need to find a passion and i gaurentee their is one out their that suits you. A therapist may be able to puzzle your emotions together and find that perfect thing that can help you. Hope I helped, best of luck|`|XHweMNNkaa	The only way to know if you need to go to therapy is to go to therapy, and see if it helps/betters anything. It's like tasting food, yeah, you can guess if you like plantains based on how you like bananas, but really, you have to taste plantains to see if you like plantains. You can try and analyze what's going on in your life and how you feel, but the only way to really know is to go to therapy for a significant period of time, and judge the results.    But using bananas as a reference, I'd say you'd benefit from therapy :)
RAOrCnonaa	First of all, there's nothing wrong with being nice. Being an asshole just makes you selfish and stupid.    In this case being assertive isn't always about taking control. It's just about taking control of YOUR life. When an issue affects you stop being a pushover. Stop giving in to others demands and always putting even the newest stranger before yourself. There's no secret to this...just do it.

Also always do what you know is right, even if nobody is there to stand by your side.It means to be happy even when things are not so great, and knowing when to relax, and enjoy, and never be selfish, it only hurts you.It means having meaningful relationships and unconditional support, never critisize yourself or put yourself down.

R9OfKCEjaa	There are various reasons why men lie. Here are a couple:    1) Men don't think things through before acting. They do what they want in the moment of wanting it, without thinking of the repecussions. Eg., a man may cheat on his partner, then later realise how stupid he was, doesn't want to lose her/upset her so lies about it.    2) Men are selfish. Many guys want to have their cake and eat it too. They will lie to ensure whatever is happening in his life that makes him happy will continue. This may mean having 5 girls on the go, he will lie because he enjoys having all their attention.    3) Some men are insecure and feel if they tell the truth about themselves, the female won't find him appealing. Eg. job. We all do that though!!|`|kLjLJKBUaa	men lie because woman go CRAZY if they hear something they dont want to.  also, if i told every girl the truth about how i felt about them, i might make them feel bad themselves!    men arent afraid to speak their minds, they are afraid of what you crazy woman will do to them when you find out.  plus if lying is going to get me sexual satisfaction (a primary bodily function) then lying to the girl who i am in a relationship with (secondary function) doesnt mean much.    not to say that i am that kind of person, i happen to be too honest :) but that could be a valid explanation for you.|`|AA11417621	I think that some men are just cowards and can't find the nerve to tell the truth.

When you read a book do you believe that maybe the characters believe that they are real and do not know that they are in fact not real and only book characters? or as though the book is an alternate universe? Or maybe, when you were a kid you played dolls and you wonder maybe the dolls believe that they are real and can not see us and think that they have free will when it is not true and so maybe we're dolls and some greater force is playing us and we believe that we're in control but it's a lie. When you die your body becomes the earth. water evaporates. Atoms can be in two different places at once so scientifically it's possible that alternate universes exist...like that theory about the dead cat. The cat may be dead here but somewhere else in some alternate universe that same dead cat is alive. Yes, sometimes I question what is real and existence.

9gqN65w3aa	Very good question .Its good people have started thinking this.  The reason for this gap, i believe is poor infrastructure in rural areas. so families of farmers or farmers themselves have no chance to develop themselves further in the same field/ any other.  Maybe , soon after independence., the country was not financially strong to develop all villages . You know the reality of colonial rule.  It was more like raping a country.  But one has to realise that self sufficienxy that was encouraged after indepence helped the cities grow, indian industries to grow & now liberalisation is taking it forward. At that time if self suffiency of industry would have not been encouraged, india would have ended up like some of these others who could never recover from colonial rule  & remained as indirect slaves/ dependents.  But right now, the infrastructure must be developed in rural areas too. then only there will be real development. or else people in rural area including farmers  &  their families will only be deprived ,keep dreaming of migrating to cities & there will be this disparity which will never never allow the whole country to progress.  When you look at the developed world, one sees a mimimum standard of living for  each citizen, though now their reality too is?. But the point to note is every citizen has to have a certain std of living only then will the country progress.|`|d6013d7446e8edf3266d4ec54b58434eaa	There are a few problems here. I'll tell you what I tell other Indian people. They never like my answer but the truth is hard. Keep in mind that high costs and high salaries are the norm in big cities. Many of these people only seem more wealthy but they don't save much more money than rural people because everything costs so much. It isn't how much they make, or how expensive things are, but how much they make COMPARED to how expensive things are. If things cost 10x as much and you only make 5x as much life is harder for you in the city and in the rural areas. When you go to the city you see all the fancy cars but you don't realize most people are walking and may not even own a bicycle. They might have two families living in one apartment to get by but all you see is the fancy cars.     India is one of my favorite nations. Please listen to what I have to say and tell all your friends and neighbors and do something before it is too late! You have a wonderful culture and history that only china can come close to matching. Don't let it all go to waste!    1) When all the wealth is concentrated in metro areas to the degree it is there it is a symptom of wealth flowing out of your country. I could write a book on this but ultimately you can decide if its true based on the evidence you have already seen.    2) Independence and democracy are not always good things. Democracy is a stop-gap. Its a better alternative to a power-mongering ruler. It NEVER lasts much more than 200 years. The people are too easy to manipulate by media, clever but corrupt politicians, and spies in the street. Beyond that other nations manage to use propaganda and spies to make the people very selfish and the politicians corrupt. Ultimately such nations either become fascist or socialist almost to the point of communisim. The united states is headed to fascism. Our people are cowardly and willing to give up thier hard won freedom at the mere threat of death. India is headed to socialism. When you gained your independence you opened your nation up to even more exploitation than you were already experiencing. The only way you are going to stop it is two fold. (I'm not advocating this) Start shooting people that dump their trash in the streets,etc. And kill criminals. Your police are ineffective and corrupt. You can't depend on them to keep crime down. They will only pursue some murders. People don't get started with murders they get started with small crimes. They get away with them and move on to bigger crimes. When so many people have been victims of crime they quit caring about others and start being selfish and just "trying to survive." This attitude is then abused by your masters to make you try to take from everyone else (socialism) with everyont trying to take from everyone else the middle men (the men working in government and their friends) get wealthy and take the peoples money. You need to band together, punish criminals, and protect each other from retaliation. If someone steals your land you need to find them and burn down their house and beat them within an inch of their life. The rich ones, the poor ones, the ones that are politicians, etc. You would have to get old people who are near death and willing to sacrifice themselves, or people who are poor enough or outraged enough to not mind being imprisoned or shot. Of course your police are so ineffective you could probably just poison or shoot the criminals and never worry about going to prison for it.    3) People in cities do not have as many children. This gives them more disposable income. People in rural areas will have five children that they can barely feed, then those children will have five more and have even less land to support them with. Your great great grand dad probably had it pretty good but poor people don't think ahead. It sounds mean but its true. You are poor because your parents didn't think ahead and limit the number of children they had. They also didn't teach you to think ahead so you will do the same thing and so on. It has been a long time since our world had a global disaster or ice age. We are overcrowded and people are still breeding like rats or some kind of virus. In your culture having many children is a sign of wealth. Quit trying to look wealthy and have some consideration for your children. Even if that means not having any at all. You can pass your land to your brother's children or his cousin. You can teach them your values. When you are too old to take care of yourself, if your brother's children won't help you then you can spend your last days punishing all the criminals that are ruining your nation.    4) public education in any nation is always geared toward producing obedient workers who will pay taxes and seek approval from people in positions of authority. Private education teaches people to think independently and take only calculated risks.    What it all comes down to is India is the same as the US. You had it too easy for too long. You didn't appreciate it, you even think you had it hard. You have grown lazy, selfish, and short sighted. You are unwilling to make the sacrifices to take back your nation and you are all going to become slaves. The only difference is in the US we will become slaves to the wealthy via their corporations, have a revolution, think we won but be stuck with what is really communisim and long hours of work. In India you will loose all your wealth to foriegn corporations then decend into socialism where you will be paying the government to waste money taking care of you (and shuffling YOUR money to friends of people in government) instead of taking care of yourselves.    Quit pointing at people that you think are better off than you and complaining. There are many who have less than you do and you didn't mention them in your question. You ARE selfish. This is the thing you must realize to make your nation stronger.    Good l

abf3ebca4c87098ec5e1b42a5f4963b3aa	A great question that, in my view, should be asked of -and actually replied to- by anyone running for public office in America.    I'll begin by answering your question directly. You ask: "why should I have to pay money for something I never did?" As deep-felt and legitimate a question as that is, I ask you to pause and simply consider for a moment, when the colonists first came to America -who "owned" this land?    A legitimate and, arguably, reasonable answer would be: a) Native Americans, b) French, c) Spanish, and d) others.  Now ask yourself, by 1776 (the signing of the Declaration of Independence) who owned this land (America)?  The factual answer is "that depends."  And it depends on the exact parcels of land an anyone may refer to as of 1776.    One absolute that all Americans can assure themselves of is that "no black people owned this land."    That statement alone is worthy of a PhD dissertation .. worthy of open dialogue in our press, our TV programming, in our chit-chats with our neighbors ... in our exchanges as we contemplate who is best fit to lead this country for the next four -possibly eight- years.    You mention (legitimately): " No man alive in the U.S. has owned a slave. No man alive in the U.S. has been a slave." as if those two sentences can repair or illuminate the history of slavery. Please know that I'm not criticizing you ... I'm merely asking you to pause and consider a different perspective.     Beyond the inhumane treatment of blacks as slaves, it seems reasonable to assert that many people today (in 2008) are where they are because their ancestors enjoyed the fruits of "free labor."  Even forgetting -or forgiving- for the moment that abject disregard of a people because of their color, we cannot easily dismiss the ADVANTAGE of free labor.      To get a better grasp of that concept ( a concept that was a REALITY for blakc Americans), consider yourself as "free labor" for anyone for the next twelve months.  My guess is, beyond your indignation, you can't even conceptualize what this means or what that actually is .... then, without judgment or assumption, at least pause long enough to digest the fact that this is what black Americans endured then -for years on end- and, to a large degree, still endure in 2008.  It is, in fact, the Black American legacy.    As such, my "legitimate answer" is that America (each of us individually, and all of us collectively) certainly owe something to Black Americans ... no, not a handout, but, at the minimum, a recognition that our nation severely handicapped them from the statrt and, as such, it's absurd to believe that they would be able to rise "above their oppression" and be able to compete on the same level as everyone else.  It is a human -and intellectual- impossibility!     So, at a minimum, we owe them "plenty." (for another perspective on this -and it is truly worth the time, Goggle "the one percent") ... it is absolutely and, in a scary sense, illuminating.    I hope you do not perceive my reply as an "argument" but simply an alternative frame-of-reference to the Black experience in America.  and yes, I am born and raised as a White American.|`|AA10700486	You totally misunderstand. The plan to share your wealth with other people has nothing to do with reparations. Reparations will be a completely separate bundle of wealth-redistribution that we'll get shafted with later.    Meanwhile, since Barack Obama is not descended from any American slaves, I wonder if he'll claim reparations when the program is launched?  |`|AA11132502	I agree with your statement.  If I remember the facts correctly, slave traders didn't personally hunt down Africans to bring into the slave trade.  Instead, some African tribes captured other African tribe members to sell into the slave trade---and then were brought to America by whites.      There have been slaves as long as there has been recorded history.  It didn't just begin with blacks.  Slavery is mentioned even in ancient Greek and Roman history!  I remember learning about the Barbary pirates who captured over one million Europeans and sold them as slaves in Northern African.    Of course, that doesn't dismiss that NONE of it was right!  But we can't even to begin to pay back every single person in recorded history who were subjected to cruelty.  We can, however, learn from it!        
61AjTvw7aa	I don't know what will make a man feel needed more than seeing all the desperate, over the hill career women who will now do just about anything to get a husband and start a family before they get too old.|`|ELZ94vMSaa	just like a woman wouldn't want to be reminded of how much more the man makes, men feel the same way.    I personally wouldn't mind if a woman made more money, but if it became a source of needling, then we'd have a problem.|`|8ldA7Z3Baa	No. It's a turn off when she has a bad attitude about it.     Many men AND women, "people" in general, become pompous when they know they are more successful. Some of these people think they are better than you, or think they own you. Many think that just because they make more money,  that they can make all the rules in the relationship.     I admire a person, male OR female, who make more money, but are still nice, kind hearted, genuine people who treat people in relationships with equality. Those are the one who deserve the greatest respect.|`|dtMZcUv6aa	If a man is turned off because you earn more money than him then firstly he's a boy not a man and obviously to insecure about himself for you to worry about. (That's my serious answer now for the joking answer). A turn off i'd love to be a kept man doing nothing living of your missus. Finally a chance to find out how women have been living for centuries.|`|WK9aCwTaaa	I totally disgree with this notion because one needs to ask do we love a person for what he or she really is or the money he or she earns?    If i get attracted to a woman it is not her pay packet but what she is as a person.    Money cannot substitute love which is the essential ingredient for a lasting warm realtionship.    Men who think a woman otherwise lovable is too successfull and too rich are jst like successful women who think that they can tfind an equal in the same sense.|`|BkleL3F4aa	No not if she's normal, if she believes that she is locked in some competition with the other gender it would be a problem but those women tend not to stay in relationships anyway.    I was asking a female friend what she thought of being with a guy who earned less and she assured me she would never allow that to happen.|`|qVmIokXPaa	Then she's either a nurse or teacher then & most men shouldn't care because that won't last forever..|`|0218bac49155f47ad58852fa8491d0daaa	I think it's bullsh_t.  I have dated many women who make far more than I do and am not the least bit intimidated by it.  If a man is worried about the income difference, it's most likely because he doesn't have much to offer besides money.|`|WKyPDbglaa	As long as she didn't think less of me it wouldn't be an issue. If your good at something you should be proud of it.        That said I can not be sure how many people think like me but (I think somewhere around not exactly sure the % is fuzzy in my memory) like 40% or more of married women make more then there husband(this is in long term marriages I believe).|`|wkjncmHTaa	I couldn't be bothered to have a relationship with someone that was so insecure they worried about me earning more than them. At the same time I think the partner earning more would be a twat to constantly bring attention to the issue.    My boyfriend says it is not a turn-off :-)|`|uXqDYPNVaa	If that's what she needs to do to keep the guy's affection, it's not worth keeping.|`|1d3NreHbaa	Only insecure  or traditional men will be turned off by that.  I don't  think the majority of men would care if she made more money then him, as long as she doesn't brag about it.  If men have a problem with women making more money then him, well then they should stick to dating traditional women.|`|fJy0vN7daa	Maybe to some men but not the majority of them.    And most men hate it when it gets rubbed in their face, it's unnecessary.|`|AA11525891	Absolutely not. I have had that happen while I was going back to school and while I was just starting my new job. My wife owns her own company and at times had made more than me. My self worth and self esteem is not tied to my income.

BMxNOJ39aa	There are no ghosts.     "Many people report physical changes in haunted places, especially a feeling of a presence accompanied by temperature drop and hearing unaccountable sounds. They are not imagining things. Most hauntings occur in old buildings, which tend to be drafty. Scientists who have investigated haunted places account for both the temperature changes and the sounds by finding physical sources of the drafts, such as empty spaces behind walls or currents set in motion by low frequency sound waves (infrasound) produced by such mundane objects as extraction fans. Some think that electromagnetic fields are inducing the haunting experience."   http://skepdic.com/ghosts.html    "There are numerous groups of paranormal investigators that spend their spare time investigating allegedly haunted places. They arrive with coffee pots, flashlights, tape recorders, EMF detectors, video cameras with night vision, metal detectors, and other devices that were not designed to detect ghosts and therefore have no instructions on how to use them for that purpose. (I know. There is no equipment designed for this purpose. How could there be?) The equipment looks scientific, but does that make the investigation scientific? "  http://skepdic.com/ghosts.html    ghosts like to work in the dark because it's harder for people to see them than in broad daylight where their invisibility is more visible.    "But not one ghost has ever been authenticated by science, not one," said Nickell, who has conducted paranormal investigations for TV shows broadcast on The History and National Geographic channels. "They're trying to use the respect of science  hey, look at this fancy equipment  to justify their superstitious beliefs.    "If they get a reading on their EMF meter," said Nickell, "or they get a picture of an orb on their camera  and because they don't know what's causing that  they say, 'Therefore it must be a ghost.' This is a logical fallacy. ... They're ghost buffs, they're enthusiasts, and yes, they read stuff off the Internet, but they're not trained. You don't want people just reading the occasional medical article and going to practice medicine."  http://timesunion.com/ASPStories/story.a...    "When he investigated Mackenzie House, a historic Toronto row house where people claimed to hear ghostly footsteps on the staircase, he found they were hearing footsteps from a parallel iron staircase in the adjacent building, about 40 inches away, he said.    When Nickell accompanied high school students and their teacher on a field trip to the supposedly haunted Hand Hotel, in Fairplay, Colo., and the lobby's chandelier flickered, the bug-eyed students oohed and aahed. But Nickell and the teacher spotted the desk clerk surreptitiously toggling the dimmer. Once discovered, Nickell recalled, the clerk shrugged sheepishly."  http://timesunion.com/ASPStories/story.a...|`|ITxP16qZaa	ghost hunters    look the up on google    ghost hunters-TAPS

LwEKi993aa	I believe its 50/50    Nature- Humans are born with an ability to learn and sometimes genetics dictates this for example a special needs child only has the capacity to learn so much as in the book Flowers for Algernon     Nurture- Although a human has the capacity to be reach their full potential that doesn't mean they will some peolple who are born in ghettos, or raised by people who do not have enough money to supply a great education for their children will grow up with children that will not reach their full potential     news report: The Napa teen shot last Saturday in a gang-related altercation died Monday at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital.    Ricardo Gonzalez, 19, was on life support after suffering a gunshot to his head Saturday around 11:55 p.m. in a street fight among rival gang members in the 2500 block of Laurel Street near Avon Street.  Police have arrested three male juveniles, ages 15, 16, and 17, in connection with the shooting.    I don't believe that these gang members have reached their full potential because then they would no have killed young Ricardo Gonzalez in my family my four year old cousin kows that killing is bad because we taught that to her     where as...    In Meet the Fockers sorry for the rated R movie reference but it is a good example the little boy in the movie is taught how to sign so that he can communicate if he had been in a home with different parents he might not have learned this technique thus resulting in not being able to communicate till he was older    so I think it works 50/50

I don't know how old you are, but if you still have that much energy after only 2 to 4 hours a sleep, that's not normal.   Also some other symptoms of manic depression are, periods of super low depression.  Also, if manic, symptoms may be, chatter mouth, doing too much at once, overspending, drugs, drinking, out of control behavior that other people have to point out to you because you don't see it yourself. Very self involved, grandiose thinking (like you are on top of the world, or God even) mood swings, temper at the drop of a second.... etc.  Maybe google Manic Depression.  YOu could have something else, I'm just suggesting  more side effects of Manic Depression, and only getting 2 to 4 hours of sleep, and still energetic the next day is one symptom of Manic Depression. There are also different levels of Manic Depression. You could be a manic, who doesn't have the lows, and is always manic. Or you are just undiagnosed.  Also, check with someone in your family that may have a history of the same problem as you do and ask if they were diagnosed with mental illness, or if it's just a hereditary thing in your family where ppl in your family don't need that much sleep.|`|50DSpDSraa	becuz you just get used to it =]|`|S3kV78fGaa	i know what you mean this happens to me sometimes but not days in a row, only one. but you should probably try to get more sleep cuz it'll most likely catch up to you.|`|eOS9hHTSaa	You're just lucky.

wpkJFL5Qaa	haters fade away, use their hate to inspire you & use that anger to help you workout & study harder, depression is a comples issue, people that have it usually don't know about it,     commiting suicide is just gona mean 1 less person who was to scared to face the world, people might miss you a day or two , but then life goes on, so what was the point of doing it?    everyone thinks about it, but just remember even if you try to commit suicide the chances of you  surviving  are 40% which means you would just became a handi-cap and everyones gona look down at you    so in short use there thougtt to pump you up in the gym, usually when your losing weight you gotta push through the pain thats perfect for you u need their hate, k good luck & if you need tips on working out i would say do more weight for squats & increse your meals to 6 meals, that will bost ur metabolism & fat will strrat coming off like mad, but don't eat to little    kk good luck|`|l344RtC8aa	i think a lot of people go through stages of depression, i went through one a few months ago. i was wondering why i could NEVER be Happy and why i cried every day. what kept me smiling was my friends, i started to go out more and hang out with people in my life that brought a positive feeling. stay away from people who bring you down. and for your family tell them you're trying to be happy with who you are!   good luck and feel better|`|kLjLJKBUaa	damn man 20 lbs? im jealous. lol    thats pretty fked up that you're family is saying that about you.  you gotta remember, the problem is them, not you.  no need to kill yourself.  you are doing just fine, its ALL MENTAL.

It will take a while to let go of the negative feelings and anger, as your anger is justified anger.    It would not do much good for either of you to confront him about how you feel and how this affects you to this day, because he appears to be in denial of his disturbing behavior.

You'll remember it always and it will be the factor that slow you down in everything. Whenever you face an obstacle and you can't even face it, you'll remember the past. Why like this and that in the past. You blame the past for what had happened to you. And you can't even erase it, not try to remember it. I didn't say that past is not good, it will be good to be once look behind, but if you always look behind, watch out, you'll fall. I was, okay, not exactly the same case, but the bad memories come over and over to me, even a few months ago, when I quit from my job. I remember about why I make such decisions in the past, why did I enrolled in a department I don't really want, why didn't I chase and try to reach my dream and so on. I became very pathetic until someone confront me and I cried out of blue, but now I can see it clearly, that I have to change, so why don't you try the same way? I see that you are clearly respects your dad, but whether he has some bad points you slowly doubt that whether you should respect him or not. But he is your father, you are here now because of him, and he might be the reason with whatever memories you remembered. You have to open your mind and heart, there's still many beautiful things outside that can beat your awful memories. Good luck
oVeGMNsLaa	Our bodies are naturally meant to smell faintly at the areas that are warm, moist, and enclosed (armpits, genitals, etc.).  That's where bacteria breed best and create these scents.    Moreover, that's how pheremones attract our mates.|`|ErkGf5ujaa	If we wished  to lower ourselves like you do yourself, here it would be:  Your large surface of spongy ba..s nearing your hair filled bottom are together the filth factory needing  extra cleaning wheras what you mention is the  anticeptic human organ with a lovely scent told not to need even soap.  Eww protruding airtightly squeezed ba.s,no need to make a further list on the parts you need double or triple washing from beard upto big extra sweaty feet to make  as clean as a women's.lol  Edit:Very honest(!)TDs made me reevaluate,maybe I am wrong...lol|`|baZMcyfpaa	Some of us don't wash very well.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Have you stopped to consider exactly what goes on down there?  Your vagina isn't exposed to open air very often and is constantly producing discharge.  So even if you are a frequent washer (which I'd hope you are), you're still going to get some odor.  It's unavoidable.
c59485c5fb066f0af7ae58a856c4b126aa	Sad fact of life: a female sexual contribution is often valued, and some people will pay for it. A male sexual contribution is often not valued, and only a few people (who can afford to) will pay for it.    But, I think you really have to take this as a case-by-case evaluation. Either sex could be using sex to take advantage; either sex could be comforting and "raising morale" as that one answerer puts it.     Example: female taking advantage would be if she has sex with a millionaire who has lost his home and his family in order to start a relationship and eventually marry him in order to access his fortune.    Example: Handsome young foreign relief worker comforts a free and liberal young woman, and neither expects to see the other again (and both are disease free, and practice safe contraceptive sex). This would be raising morale.    But in any case, it's probably not a good idea to take the time to have sex in an earthquake disaster area. It can easily be misinterpreted, and the neighbors would talk. If you are living in tents, the neighbors talking is a serious problem.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	They are boosting morale|`|u1vEj8DYaa	What a load of crap.
smFfcmYuaa	It sounded like OCD at the start and schizophrenia in the middle but the latter doesn't onset that quickly and people who suffer from OCD don't turn psychotic when trying to get over it. Is sleep deprivation an issue for you? If you gave up on an exercise regimen that would automatically make you feel worse. Giving up on it and over-eating just multiplies your issues though again wouldn't lead to delusions unless you have some kind of poisoning problem.     But seriously, if it bothered you that much to give up your ritual why didn't you just go back to it? It's true that the only way to get over an obsessive behavior is to confront it and quit doing it but did it matter that much?     Go in for an in-depth psychiatric evaluation somewhere and in-depth allergy testing (have them test for both atmospheric and food allgergies, even rare ones like copper and MSG, amounts of which are both likely in the foods you're over-eating right now) somewhere else. Get checked for cancer, get a CT scan and MRI of your brain, what the hell. And, maybe you are just psyching yourself out as minor issues have piled up but if that's the case the testing should help to relieve your stress.|`|vk1TcfTeaa	I think you sound like you're not at peace with some big things in your life. You are having extreme anxiety, which at times can feel like you're absolutely going to lose it. Please don't kill yourself, this is not worth that cost. You are a valuable person and I hope you can see that.     I would either go see another therapist, or talk to a pastor at a church. While many issues can be worked out with a therapist, i think so many problems are related to spiritual matters. If you come to "spiritual" peace and you still are having these problems, then i'd seek help medically, because there could be other issues.     don't give up...|`|zFc4Mth5aa	well the first thing to discuss is the suicide part because I believe that is the most important. suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. in the end, everything will be okay. however, when I was in high school i was depressed and often considered suicide until i had this dream. It scared the crap out of me.    I was in my room, but there was no furniture in there. I was standing in the corner, and i dont know why but i was holding a gun to my head. i was crying. i remember slowly squeezing the trigger as i felt heat on the side of my head and i remember thinking "its too late to take it back now". everything like faded to black as i fell to the ground.    this was the scariest dream of my life. It made me realize that even though things were bad, i would regret killing myself. Im sure you would too.     The second thing would be your problems. If your friends cant understand, or cant believe you then you need to talk to somebody else. maybe you should talk to your parents or a professional. I do know that when people are tripping on shrooms that the walls breathe, but as you said you don't do drugs. I would at least talk to somebody with some maturity about this before you do something you'll regret. believe me, you'll regret it.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	You need to seek profession help immediately.  If you are telling the truth, you are exhibiting a wide array of symptoms that could be any number of serious disorders.  You probably have a chemical imbalance in your brain that needs to be corrected along with good therapy.  You need to seek help.  Don't put it off before it is too late.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Honey, you need much more than a therapist.  You need to be meeting with a psychiatrist or a psychiatric nurse practitioner for medication.  You have some serious psychosis going on here, possibly a few other disorders.  Get yourself in for an assessment as soon as is humanly possible.|`|fN3dsHERaa	I'm assuming your in college, so whenever you feel like that is consuming you, go for a run or better yet- go to the gym. You know what- I have a better idea.   Whenever I get numb or just feel so down that I'm helpless I create a schedule that will lead me to success without me having to think (or feel... or just be unnumb).   Give this schedule thing a month and a half to work, okay? You must stick to it in order for it to work. I'll give you an example, but you have to fit it to your schedule. Once you get out of this state of whatever you're in, modify the schedule-but until you start feeling better-just have faith in this plan and in yourself.     Monday:   6:00am- wake up: brush teeth, shower, dress  6:40am- go for run  7:00am- return to dorm(assuming you are college student),eat,  wash face, style hair, do whatever to make yourself feel pretty  7:40am- do whatever (recommend: read a new book every two weeks-use this time for reading)  [Let's just say your next 8 hours are classes and lunch and what not]  8:00am-4:00pm CLASSES  4:00pm-4:30pm get to work  4:30pm - 7:30pm Work  7:30pm: Chillax with roomate or friend/ something small and social  8:00pm- library or dorm or study place to study for school and complete homework  9:00-9:10pm= break/snack  9:10pm- 10:10pm- study/homework  10:10-10:30pm - whatever  then sleep... and do it all over again    that's just a template- you have to make it fit you. Don't spend a lot of time in your room- just your sleeping time or hanging out with people, okay? good luck|`|QD6Nhah1aa	yea u really should go to a doctor or at least family and freinds this is really serious|`|s7JsThPuaa	I wont lie. Killing your self is really easy. pills, cutting, and the old firearm are tried and true methods BUT if you are going through with this, find a way to make some money on the side to help cover the cost for the plot of land they will bury you in, along with casket cost and other tidbits. its a pain in the *** to lose a loved and a bigger one to have said loved ones pay and feel more grief.    ON THE OTHER HAND!!!  steps can be taken to fix these problems. starting off with the least expensive problems and working your way up.  --when comfort eating, eat things that are healthy for you OR eat things that do nothing for you like top ramen or flavored rice cakes.  -- need attention? get a cat.  -- hearing voices? they are either trying to make you go mad, or trying to help you in some way.  or find a priest or a lv. 5 cleric to see if you have a haunting brought on by your self destruction and turmoil (use this as a last resort because you will have a pissed off ghost in the room if it's even a spirit at all)    earn some cash by can collecting or blood banks or just collect objects off the street and work with them or sell them for scrap.  either you will make money or be creative enough to keep your mind busy for the afternoon.    lastly try sleeping pills or liqueur to go to sleep, few days of good solid sleep will do wonders.

That means reading all the obvious signs and making a common sense prediction.  Like when there are dark clouds outside, it looks like it could rain, and poof! Rain happens.  Try testing your cold reading skills on card games, like poker.  Nothing psychic here, just a coincidence and some brains.|`|F9ZY4EeIaa	phychic is the first step to psycho, no ur not psychic, u got lucky|`|kLjLJKBUaa	what he said.    psychics are B.S. man.  everything you talked about, you most likely had background information or prior knowledge about the subject.    for instance, you know the traffic is bad there, its probably a bad street, its not unlikely that someone will get hit.  a trouble-maker girl getting into a fight? come on.     i pickup my phone sometimes too before it rings, but you never know why that happens. i know that the electromagnet pulses or whatever they reach the phone before it rings, and we still arent sure how these things effect humans. maybe you are very prone to feeling them.    a lot of times me and my x-gf would text eachother at the exact same time randomly. i dont consider us psychic.  maybe its just how the brain works.    also, a psychologist has nothing to do with a psychic.|`|C0Dj76OMaa	intuition?  you might be, i dont care what those people say, my mom is to some extent, and always has been, shes predicted a lot of stuff.    anyways, my mom has this group of people who meet once a month and discuss it, theirs actual careers for it!   go develop your gift.

AA11532132	It is an example of ideal rights, not actual rights. Much like the declaration of independence, it will probably never be fully adhered to. It is a standard to measure our actions against.
