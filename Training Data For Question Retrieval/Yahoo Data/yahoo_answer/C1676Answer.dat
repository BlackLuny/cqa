ErixfJ9Iaa	Creo, si no me equivoco, que si no salís de "pasajeros en transito", no necesitas ningún tipo de visado. Salvo que quieras salir del aeropuerto, ahí si pueden requerirte algún papel, pero si no no creo que lo necesites.
lg2RfcrQaa	The very first plane I went on, we flew luxury class and used the lounge (compensation because my dad was involved in a plane crash. Oh the joys!). If you take full advantage of the croissants and magazine then yes it probably is worth the money. I used the one at Heathrow and although I was young at the time I can remember it being really good. The ones abroad can be a bit less excting though.    Even though they were nice I wouldn't pay to use them again. I actually prefer shopping and trying on all the perfumes in Boots, watching TV and reading a mag from WH Smiths rather that sat in a quiet room full of business men on their laptops while eating extortionate amounts of food.|`|AA10034577	Depends how frequently you fly.  Its more for people who fly a lot.  Paying time by time is kind of dumb,.|`|OPrgBGAjaa	my mum and dad done it thought they would treat themselves and they said it was not worth it and would not do it again waist of money did not get half the things they said you get|`|VlhmbHGGaa	I would say yes if you have a couple of hours wait. Especially if the terminal is crowded. It's relaxing to sit in a comfy chair with snacks and drinks readily available for self-service.    But if your wait is under 2 hours, not really. Then it's better to have a drink at one of the bars/pubs.
VSX9tzJaaa	they probably will, but they may still charge a fee|`|	Go read the rules of the tickets that you bought. It will be stated there. If not, contact the airlines and they would advise you according.|`|	Sadly no.  The tickets I've purchased from Orbitz or Travelocity  have all been non-refundable and also non-changable.  You can try contacting the airline and asking if they will waive the non-changable rule, since this is an emergency now.  Some will, but typically for a fee.  (usually a change fee of about $50-$100 and sometimes also the difference between the original fare and cost of same flights on the day the ticket is changed)---very expensive!|`|	i think you can but your going to have to pay an amount f money to rearrange your flight

In addition, save the printout if this is for a round trip because you will need it again for your return trip.

AA11272120	I used Expedia to find flights from John F. Kennedy Int'l (JFK) to Tokyo Narita Int'l Airport (NRT) and then narrowed the search down to exclude flights with stops. I made the search for flights leaving on April 1 and returning on April 8.     I found American Airlines offers direct flights to Japan from $956 round-trip. All Nippon Airways (ANA) offers round-trip flights from $1197.     Japan Airlines (JAL) offers round-trip flights from $1301 and finally, United Airlines offers round-trip flights from $1492.      Hope this helped,    JPJ|`|AA10412319	check out hotwire.com, expedia.com, yahoo.com, orbitz.com, etc (i think you can get it cheaper if you have an account with them), basically what i do i google "flights" and different flight websites have diffferent websites. hope this info helped.
JLw4axJBaa	Limos start at around $50/hr or $50 for a one way trip to/from the airport + tip. It's not going to get cheaper than that.

8VEEihaqaa	Flight prices depend on the time of year and whether or not you're willing to work for the cheaper flight.  I find flights to and from the mainland for a few hundred dollars cheaper, but only because I book separately.  You can find flights as cheap as $215 from Vegas, $184 from Oakland CA, and $177 from San Jose, all flights are one-way to Kauai on Hawaiianair.com, so if you can find a cheap flight, or even catch a bus to one of those cities, it's pretty cheap.    And yes. it is possible to live in the "jungles" of Kauai, even though they're not jungles, they're rainforests.  Lots of people do it.  They fly here with a few things and go straight to Kalalau, where there's actually a community of people who live in the forests that skirt the beach.  It's a beautiful part of the island, so beautiful I've met people who come here for vacation, go camping there, and never go home.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	just swim there like Tarzan.|`|8uCuoLvdaa	He can't swim - the sharks would get him!
3155563400d13ab376918235017a5d56aa	If you look up drawing tutorials on Deviantart.com , there's a person who's done a three parter on the physical genotypes of the world races. Interestingly enough, the German type isn't like the "typical" German you see in movies, I think those men have more Scandanavian looks, or something like that. Anyway, I think her name on Deviantart is Cedarseed Good luck!|`|FzdfhsAYaa	Racism.|`|lXOjqvcPaa	they are tall people even the girls|`|CvGEdIUiaa	There are no specific genetics for a nationality. German is a nationality, just like Italian or Spanish or US-American is a nationality. If you are looking for genetic traits that would define a heritage, you would have to look for "west-European", since all of this is basically one giant gene-pool, considering the moves the ancient tribes (Friesians, Celts, Frankonians, Bajuvars, Huns, Saxons...) did across Europe. Even a genetic test could not give you a more specific answer than that you would be/are causcasian with genetic traits generally found in the west of Europe.|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	I think it's Guanin, Adenosin, Cytisin, and Thyamin.

rftGDlRgaa	Tons of 'mos in Cambridge.  It's not a "gay neighborhood" like the South End or Jamaica Plain (even though that's not a fair assessment; there are tons of people from all sexual orientations in those neighborhoods) but you will find a sizable gay population in Cambridge.|`|AA11732565	They're here! Check out The Boston Phoenix and The Metro for events.  With the number of students around here, there is lots of activity!|`|vg7YgJfOaa	I would suggest checking out the South End of Boston.  There is a large gay population there.  I'm pretty sure they have a gay pride parade every year too.

Nel08Kvvaa	Metro Detroit is like any other community in America ...    My only suggestion is that you avoid the city of detroit itself ... but not for the discrimination issue ...    You will get beaten, robbed or killed REGARDLESS of your nationality.    Move to the suburbs in ANY direction.    Welcome to Michigan ... great place to live!|`|MBFeHS22aa	If you found a job in Michigan more power to you.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	No, absolutely not. There are many racial groups there, I can't imagine anyone would even notice.|`|AA11850523	You will NOT be discriminated against if you speak English|`|x3mFm4exaa	No you will not get discriminated against, people are here are not that rude, as long as you don't disrespect anyone no one will bother you and good luck on your job!|`|DwYksIwHaa	I'll have to disagree with Kenneth. The downtown area is actually really nice. My family works downtown at the Renaissance Center. There are rough areas though on the outskirts of the downtown area.    You'll be fine. Move to the suburbs.|`|07839eb866123cd19011909143c5f768aa	as long as u drive faster than 20 mph, then you'll be ok.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Not at all us Michigan people can be really nice. I am white i have a niece and nephew who are half Korean .my niece is so beautiful.   Detroit has a lot of different racial groups there.|`|8yBSvV70aa	Move to Troy, lots of Asians there.  But you'll be fine as long as you don't move into the ghetto.  I may be blunt, but that's the truth.|`|tDKuTKG5aa	There is discrimination all over the world, no matter where you live.    But you're moving to Michigan for a job?  That's surprising.  Good luck if the company can actually last through these hard times.    As the other person said, if you can't speak english.. that's where your problem will be.  But that's anywhere in the U.S.|`|zYGJh5Odaa	no i dont think so because i am half asian and i use to live down there.|`|P2u2Rqu5aa	I agree with just about everyone. If you are interested in living with other asian Americans then check out greatschools.net and you can look up the ethnic makeup of each school.     I recently moved to San Diego from Michigan and I think it is pretty amazing how many different ethnic groups are represented in my son's school.     You are going to have a great time in Michigan. The people there have a lot of heart. I don't think you will face discrimination at all. Try and find out where your fellow co-workers live and that will tell you a good idea of where to start looking.     Good Luck. Michigan is having some tough times right now. As you can tell by the people surprised you found a job. It is a really great place.  (please don't let the person who said you had to know English deter you)|`|tBXoUBkJaa	Absolutely Michigan is one of the most subvertly racist in the union. The Detroit area is very segregated. If your job is downtown, I suggest getting a loft down town. But i say welcome Michigan, especially the Detroit metro area, need diversity badly. You maybe be able to see an ounce of the racism on this page, you know people assuming that you may have difficulties with English solely because you are Asian. We do have various Asian ethnic groups in the area,  we  have pockets of people with Filipino Origin, Korean Origin, Vietnamese Origin, Japanese Origin, Indian Origin, and a niche of ethnic Hmong on Detroit's east side if you were interesting in knowing about what Asian ethnicity's are present. There are many middle eastern, Eastern European,  Latino/ and Hispanic ethnic groups in the area as well. We are pretty much segregated though!

AA11134471	I wasnt on the Legend, but the Grandeur which is the same class of ship. They are a little older and not as big as the other ships, but it was still nice. You didnt seem crouded, and there was plenty to do on board. I just love where they have the buffet set up. Its up above the bridge and has windows all around, for a really nice view. The solarium was really nice too. It was a fun cruise and I would have no problems going on the ship again.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|qT4dCn9Qaa	well im going on freedom of the seas, its going to be great. I highly reccomend that cruise ship because its one of the biggest that royal Caribbean has, theres lots of stuff to do, its going to be so much fun. I cant wait.
1qWAWQnFaa	Harper College is a great community college it's not far from the city either. Life here is nice as long as you pick a decent area. I live in the suburbs of chicago which (without traffic) is only like 25 mins from the city so it's not bad. Winter sucks here (compared to cali) but we dont have tornadoes, mudslides, hurricanes, and that kind of crap so that's a plus. The city has amazing places and clubs and stuff to go to.   As far as the license goes i think you do have to take another test. But not positive.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Chicago kicks ***. The suburbs (where I live) are cool. In the suburbs there are a few good community colleges. Harper (where I went for a few semesters), College of Dupage, and College of Lake County are all good.     If you live in the city, check out the City Colleges of Chicago. If you don''t live in the city, the NW burbs (Schaumburg, Palatine, Arlington Heights) are good places to live. If you live here you'd go to Harper. The north suburbs are also nice (Vernon Hills, Mundelein, Wauconda) are all nice. If you live here you'd go to College of Lake County. The western burbs of Lombard & Wheaton are nice. College of Dupage is for this area. All of these towns are within 30 minutes of downtown Chicago depending on the weather and the road construction.     The winters do get cold and there is snow, but it beats annual fires/mudslides, and the threat of an earthquake. It is well worth moving here. You have to have an Italian beef with cheese and green peppers when you come here. It is the best Chicago food (in my own opinion).|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	life is ok here at this time if you like snow  as for your DL once youget your cali. license all you would have to is take the Illinois test(exam)|`|nz5HkSPiaa	yes im from chicago and nothing in california beats chicago do it you won't regret it
zlZDQz0Baa	It really depends on what they like. Do they want a quieter atmosphere? UnWined is a great wine bar. Do they like blues & jazz and beer? Strange Brew always has live blues/jazz and has more beer on tap than I can count. Looking to dance to a cover band? Tell them to try the Black Brimmer. If they want to hop around and check out a bunch of places, focus their time on Elm St. They can walk to a variety of places, such as: JW Hills (sports bar), Shaskeen (Irish Pub), Penuche's (bar), Palace Theater, Margaritas (Mexican), Black Brimmer, Wild Rover (Irish Pub), McGarvey's (bar, usually has karaoke), Murphy's Tap Room, Upstairs Lounge at Picolla's (more of a martini lounge above the Italian restaurant)...there is a lot to choose from.    Hope this helps!

mXCDJ9jYaa	Close to 1500. I would like to see someone tally up the total civilian kill figures since 1948 including the Palestinians in Lebanon.     No one will pay until the Palestinians have the means to retaliate. Political assassination has served the zionists well; perhaps they should take a page from their enemy's book.|`|wVsjgj35aa	More than 1,400 according the UNRWA,predominately women,children and elderly. Eventually the zionists will pay for these and other crimes but not anytime soon,thanks to their current foreign affairs Golem; i.e. the USG.|`|rfD11nZEaa	Yes Bosco  almost 1400 civilians were burnt using phosphorus bombs  More than 550 child  250 women  200 old men|`|mE4SbWIuaa	There is no way to know for sure what the actual number of deaths are in Gaza since Hamas controls all that information.  But, according to most semi-reliable sources, between 1300 and 1400 deaths were reported and about 1 quarter of them were civilians.  I have serious doubts about both numbers though and believe there were far less killed. That is the price of war.     As much as the Arabic countries would like to lay all the blame on Israel, most countries and people recognize that Hamas instigated this war and then hid behind the civilian population.  So, I hope they are held accountable.|`|wdyf1sueaa	Well I figure.. by the Israeli video of missile hitting Hamas x 4 that's about 1500 to 2000 Hamas terrorists, don't believe me check UTUBE, civilians, not many, same as Hezbollah did in Lebanon, same body over and over, 3 4 times.|`|YilXDO4Zaa	How could you tell?  You can't trust Hamas to count right, because they are a terrorist organization and have been caught in lies before.  There is no reliable source of information about it.|`|ckwpC3y1aa	In fact, there were about 200 - 250 civilian deaths in Gaza. Considering that the Hamas booby-trapped hundreds and thousands of homes, schools and mosques, the number is amazingly low.     This is a testimony to the Israel Army's great efforts to avoid civilian casualties.|`|iUL0GU3paa	around 1500... half of them children... and the rest are women and elderly... and not even 10% of them are Hamas soldiers....all these ppls blood are in the necks of the israeli government and their troops that killed all these innocent palestinians..... may they burn in hell how they burned all these ppl with phosphorus bombs...... !!!|`|ISxdNDeGaa	according to metallica ( the very funny member here on Y!a) only 10 Palestinians could have died!! ...(I wish!!)    quoting metallica :-  "Oh and JayJay, the 1200 palestinians killed (which I don't believe) is from "palestinian sources". For all we know, only 10 palestinians could have died."    lol!|`|mB8Q3iXqaa	Certainly its not enough because the rockets and the mortars still continute.  Some of those mortars contain white phosphorous.. but of course that is ok because it aint no Jews doin it.|`|Kik3epkVaa	If you mean just from this latest attempt to annihilate them,the figures quoted above are accurate. But the zionists have committed many,many,many vile massacres there since 1947; three took place during their occupation in the winter of 1956-57. To look at the big picture their genocidal campaign against Gazans has been going on relentlessly since 1967. They like to kill them incrementally so no one will bring up unpleasant terms like "mass murder' and "genocide".|`|qzsDSsoWaa	I was reading last week a Hamas source, they said they lost around 48 fighters, so actually the balance are all civilians.    ImpaKt I love that Gestapos comparison .... 10/10|`|mM8HUQMzaa	Hamas is totally at fault for 8 long years of lobing missiles at Israel and using the Palestine civilians as "sandbags".    Civilians: There is no such word in the Legal code of Islam (Sharia) and all Moslems are conscripted by Allah. In Lebanon and in the Gaza Strip civilians were used as protective shields. Moslems are the 'Army' of Allah carrying their God-given mission to defeat Satan: all means justifying the end.
dpKntiZoaa	Well then you have a problem.  If you cannot register at an address then you can't get the CPR number.  What the owner is doing is actually illegal and sounds like it is a case of sub-rental. Whilst it is not your problem, if found you will have no rights and can be kicked out the apartment with no notice.<br>  <br>  So either you have to move or find an address where you can register (but of course if you do not actually live there and get caught this will have it's own implications).<br>  <br>  Personally I would look elsewhere solving both the risk and also allowing you to get a CPR number.  I know you say you can't afford it, but it's catch 22. You can't work without a CPR number and you can't afford another apartment unless you work.....

The closest hotel is the Benson (SW Oak & Broadway). They pick up every half hour, from 4:00AM to 7:00PM, at 10 after the hour and 40 after the hour without reservation.<br>  <br>  Union Station is 14 block south of the MAX line, which is a light rail. On Yamhill and SW Broadway you can board the MAX for $2.00. It takes about 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  I help travelers daily and am happy to help if you have any other questions. |`|a6779150ee307fd979ff5c54c79e3cabaa	Not sure but there are busses.

You can buy peanut butter but the Mexican brands taste like they have Lard in them. Walmart and Cosco may have Peter Pan or Skippy but you usually cannot buy a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a restaurant.  They may have them in hotels in tourist areas but not in an ordinary Mexican restaurant.|`|AA11492774	Que es eso??? (What is that?) ... LOL!

The public school system is fantastic, my parents work there, and I'm graduating from high school this year. It's warm most of the time, and the coldest it gets is the low 40s, usually around this time. It's no more than half an hour to the beach in Ft. Lauderdale, and it's also close to Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood airport. It's also a reasonable drive from the homes of the Panthers (hockey), Marlins (baseball), Dolphins (football), and Heat (basketball). I don't know how the housing market is right now, but there are plently of people who want to sell.

Be sure to stand next to it as the show is choreographed to music.  Go see the white tigers at the Mirage.  The Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. One day go downtown.  Have a shrimp cocktail at the world famous Golden Gate Hotel.  Be there at night so you can watch the Fremont Street Experience show.<br>  <br>  #5 Eat at a really cheap buffet like Circus Circus or the Sahara.

Go to The Hard Rock, its a must see.  Have a drink at the Center bar.  Boby English is great on Sundays nights at the Rock.  Hit the gift shop there and shop.

Good Choice!!|`|RgJzIlGdaa	First, be careful about who you tell in Vegas about being up for anything...there's some crazy stuff there.  Tao is sick, but just about all the clubs in Vegas are pretty cool if thats your scene.<br>  <br>  Show:  Any of the Cirque du Soleil shows.<br>  <br>  Gambling:  Craps is the most fun, don't let all the bets fool you, bet the passline, take the odds, maybe bet the numbers(I make field bets occasionally too)...the dealers will help you.  Roulette is fun too, but there usually alot of losing involved before you hit a number.  Stay away from the slots, worst odds and BORING.  The table games have the smallest odds stacked against you, but they are all stacked against you and if you play long enough, you're gonna lose.  <br>  <br>  Crazy/Fun Stuff:  The rides at the top of the stratosphere, one swings you out over the edge.  If you really are up for anything, go to Sapphire, they have male and female strippers on the weekends.  Any Vegas cab driver will give you a free ride there if you ask.  You can find one before you even go that can give you even more suggestions if you want at <a href="http://www.askacabbie.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.askacabbie.com.</a>  They know Vegas better than anybody, where do you think I got all this info from?  :-)<br>  <br>  Food:  The buffet at the Bellagio.

A nice hotel, shuttle available. Good rates, restaurant. But they do not always have occupancy.    Delta normally has plenty of rooms available, but are extremely overpriced and the same highway (as by Greenwood) runs directly north of the hotel.Though it is a beautiful hotel.    Greenwood is noisy as there is a train that runs directly behind the hotel, as well as the highway directly west of the building. Though it is a nice hotel and a good rate.     WORST HOTELS:  Ramada - Building falling apart, bad service. Good rates. Good occupancy. **last year a child was pierced with a syringe, from an unmade bed at the Ramada.

Believe me you'll feel a hell of a lot safer there 24/7 than I ever would be in Roxbury, Mass (for example).|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Ive lived in Montreal, Toronto, and Edmonton. I wont disagree that there is not AS MUCH culture in Edmonton, but I wouldn't say they are more racist people there than anywhere else in canada. my son is mixed and NEVER once did I hear a remark, get a bad look, have anything implied...  i wont lie to you, it wont be home, but its not that bad and its ONE YEAR...  go make ur money and do what you gotta do..  its an opportunity you shouldn't miss for the sake of a stretched out rumour.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Its Canada how bad can it be  They may not love you, but they will respect you|`|NmZ6Bn9waa	if you don't mind minus 20  in winter .Vancouver better climate Nice people   Go to tourismvancouver  for free guides|`|iWzQd6wKaa	I think it would be wrong to give up an opportunity like that just because you might run into a few racists in Edmonton. You probably won't have too many problems because there are so few black people there. Rednecks usually direct their ignorance towards large groups of immigrants. Well I've never been black in Edmonton, but I think you should just go and see how it is. If you don't like it you don't have to stay more than a year anyway. Winters are not that bad, you just need the proper clothing.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	thats is not true..yes probaly you have seem more diversity in toronto because obviously its a bigger city but there are alot of black people here from toronto and other places of the world I know indians...arabs...latinos...chinese...ev... you can imagine...Im spanish and never had a problem here.. I think if you are here for work or studies..all you need to know is that there are lots of opportunitties here...people should respect you for who you are not what you look like, obviously the person who said this was very ignorant...    here are some useful sites...    www.movetoemonton.ca  www.edmonton.ca  www.edmonton.com

But the word is used elsewhere in the world as well. One of the most common uses is to describe the hats worn by chefs.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	tuque, and no, its a Quebec or France thing...  the only difference from a normal winter hat is a bobin on the top...|`|sgaVCFY6aa	its tuque a toque is a type of hat in France|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	A tuque (or toque, or touque as it can also be spelled) is a hat that is most commonly used in Canadian winters, but it originated with the French trappers that came to Canada for its fur trade in the 18th century.    It is usually a woolen hat that covers the ears, and often has a pom-pom on the end, which is more for decoration than for any purpose.    I'm not sure why the fur lined hats with flaps for the ears and a visor never caught on as much here. Perhaps the tuque was ingrained into our blood from 200+ years of history!
