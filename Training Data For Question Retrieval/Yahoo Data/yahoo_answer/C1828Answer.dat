You can probably get a better athlon x2 for less money than a slower intel though, so it's your choice to make.

ELF5Y6IQaa	HP makes the best printers period. The HP Photosmart C5580 is a good choice.|`|llqnQaVVaa	If you are looking for a cheap all in one printer then the HP F4235 is a good buy. I just bought one at Sam's for $40 with ink included. Walmart sells the ink HP60 for about $15 for the black. I have read about 30 reviews on this printer and they all give it 4-5 stars. Now days there is no reason to spend big money for printers unless you want it for maybe a business or much more special applications. It will print-scan and copy, if you want fax they also have an epson for about $60.<br>  You will need your usb cable from your other printer as it is not included but you can get one for about $10 at wal-mart. To save on your color ink you can even tell it to just print in black and only go back to color when you need it. It uses hp60 cartridge.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

dkpIjt5jaa	Don't be tempted by Netbooks !<br>  <br>  Netbooks are very good for Internet BROWSING not so much for playing online. They are not that good for MS Office ( screen size, cramped keyboard ). They are the "pits" (not that good at all) for iTunes and similar multimedia apps as they are not built for it.<br>  <br>  ALL the consumer-level Netbooks* have NO internal CD/DVD drives and the following MAXIMUM memory limits:<br>  Linux based: 512 MBs<br>  XP based: 1 GB (some RARE exceptions have 1.5 GBs)<br>  <br>  * There are newer so-called high-end Netbooks that come with more but they are generally pricier than laptops.<br>  <br>  Hard drives models average 80 GBs ( some have 160 GBs )<br>  <br>  Other models use SSD** (Solid State Drive) with no moving parts ( good when you move a lot as they are more "solid" (pun intended) ) but these are smaller in GBs and higher in cost.<br>  <br>  ** This is "similar" to the way USB memory stick work.<br>  <br>  You should get a affordable (not cheap) "Laptop" not a "Netbook" (you CAN get a few good ones at prices that would make a Netbook blush). The best way to find these is by doing research.<br>  <br>  But GOOD LUCK getting a new one with XP !!!<br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking some models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your research.

Contrary to what someone else erroneously told you here, the shared files folder contains the files you want to share with everyone who uses your computer.<br>  <br>  Don't monkey around deleting stuff you know little about or you'll end up with a computer that doesn't work at all.|`|w87icQkoaa	You may delete it.

You can rent and pay monthly for a server from dedicated server hosting providers. <br>  2. Or you can buy a server and do colocation at a data center. It is not practical to host a server at home though. <br>  <br>  The first choice is easier because you can get a server located anywhere in the world so you can shop around for the best service and price. A hosting provider can help you install cPanel, register domain and configure your server. You can look for one at <a href="http://bestdedicatedserver.org" rel="nofollow">http://bestdedicatedserver.org</a><br>  <br>  However, if you still not clear of what to do with the server, I suggest you read this article first: <a href="http://hostingsthatsuck.com/affiliate-commission-or-reseller-residual-income/" rel="nofollow">http://hostingsthatsuck.com/affiliate-co...</a><br>  <br>  There may be easier solutions to what you want to achieve.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7d38a72f788eceb586826662941d66c3aa	CPanel is a web management console for web based services such as email and the like.  If you want to register a domain name, use any domain name registrar on the internet.  There are many out there, most of which offer hosting services in conjunction with the the domain name registration, but most of them will just register the domain name for you.  As far as the server goes, any decent computer will work, and by all means use a server operating system. Don't go trying to host websites on a Windows XP machine.  Beyond the physical layer, the most important thing if you want to host websites, especially if you want to host multiple domains on one connection is LOTS of bandwidth.  If you have the availability, go for a dedicated server connection which will provide maximum sustained bandwidth.|`|IzCCoKNoaa	I'm going to also recommend you start with a Reseller account.

A lot of things you need to figure out, such as:<br>  <br>  1. Where you want to host the hosting?<br>  2. What kind of customers you are targeting? Like is it US/Europe/Asia?<br>  3. What kind of hosting service you want to provide? Is it just webhosting? <br>  4. Do you include email hosting as well?<br>  5. Does web design included?<br>  6. If you do not include web design, do you have any software for your client to DIY their website themselves? <br>  <br>  The questions go on.... well .. I think you need to have a clear mine on what you want to do with the hosting company before you could proceed further. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

If so, login to your router (usually something like <a href="http://192.168.0.1)" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.0.1)</a> and look at the documentation that came with your router which describes how to setup the wireless. Look for SSID, WEP or WPA-PSK. Once those are configured in your router, add those settings to your wireless configuration in your laptop.<br>  <br>  If you need further or more specific information, feel free to IM me.<br>  <br>  her'e a link to a guide of sorts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://billconlon.pointclark.net/?page_id=258" rel="nofollow">http://billconlon.pointclark.net/?page_i...</a>|`|wOcJ60Jxaa	dwhen setting up a wireless router there are several things that need to be done. your computer is plugged into the first port in the LAN section of the router and the Internet is plugged into the WAN port. first Internet connection, then wireless security, then mac address filtering, and finally your ip address and port forwarding if this applies. your problem with the Internet with the firewall of is that your NAT, which takes the ip address given to you by your internet provider and uses it for every computer behide it when they need to access the network, does not have this internet ip adress and therefore cannot forward the adresses from the internet to inside your network.  hope this helps if not feel free to ask.|`|qlBKfyVpaa	if you are using windows vista , first go to your router setup page and make sure its broadcasting your SSID , then go to your computer  , network and sharing center , managing networks , delete the existing connection and try to connect again|`|saJh5QPpaa	did you use the cd that came with the router if not<br>  its probly not configured probly.

IsTUYeABaa	In the event that this is a homework problem, I'm not going to give you the answer, but hopefully this will set you on the right path:<br>  <br>  Your code works to add 7 to each digit, though it uses far more steps that you need.  Rather than casting the input as an integer right away, take advantage of the string functions that Visual Basic offers.<br>  <br>  First of all, what you accomplish in four lines of code inside a While...End While statement can be accomplished in one line if you treat the input as a string:<br>  <br>  Dim strEncryptedNumber as String = ""<br>  <br>  For Each c As Char In numberOne<br>  strEncryptedNumber += CStr((Integer.Parse(c) + 7) Mod 10)<br>  Next<br>  <br>  What this does is looks at each character in the input string, parses it as an integer, adds 7, then casts the result modulo 10 as a string and appends it to strEncryptedNumber.<br>  <br>  So, now you're at the point where you need to start swapping places.  Dim up another string variable and take a look at the Microsoft.VisualBasic.Mid function.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

sq31kHxAaa	For $1000 you can get a really good laptop. As of this writing, Tigerdirect.com is having a big sale, and so is Dell.com.<br>  <br>  Tigerdirect has a variety of laptop brands to choose from... just make sure to stay clear of the "refurbished" models, unless a refurb doesn't bother you. Lenovo is a good brand... my sister has one, and she loves it.<br>  <br>  Since you already know the minimum specs you want, the best thing to do is to just shop around online at the major websites, so you'll have a feel for what you'd want. Then narrow it down to your top 3-5 from there.

dySHIwYxaa	Ive had a 22" windscreen LCD monitor for 2 years now, I dont have any problems.<br>  <br>  Have you set up your computer graphics to the native resolution for your monitor?  Best to select 1680 x 1050 via your control  panel.<br>  <br>  Your new monitor has a contrast Ratio : 700:1 (typical) 10,000:1 <br>  No problems their. Try changing the brightness and contrast setting on your new monitor.<br>  <br>  If this new monitor is larger than your last monitor, then the higher resolution and screen size will show the detail far better, but if the pic/ vid file being viewed  is of a low quality,then you will notice the lower quality more as you will be used to high detail. E.g. Many Youtube Mpegs look blocky as the video quality on youtube is mostly very low.<br>  <br>  Also if you have a DVI connection on your monitor, this should give better results than the analog connection.<br>  <br>  Other than that, is your graphic card capable of smoothly displaying 1680 x1050 resolution?  Most on-board graphics might struggle.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	You can adjust the brightness and contrast settings using the monitor. Hit the buttons on the front of it.

s9Cq9nCaaa	A Dual Core is all that is required but may be a little on the expensive side. I would advise shopping for a CPU & Motherboard combo as you can often get them cheaper than the rest. Depending on the price and speed that should determine whether you buy DDR2 or DDR3 RAM, let the motherboard you choose tell you which RAM to get. As for a PSU (Power Supply Unit) I would advise looking for a nice case that has one with it.When checking the status make sure the PSU has the correct connectors and enough wattage. a 300 watt is sufficient usually unless you wish to run a lot of extra hardware. Some cases will come with 500 watt PSUs but you have to shop around. I prefer Geforce and I think it lacks graphical sharpness, but I like ATI a lot, even Nintendo used ATI in the GameCube and when it came out it has phenomenal graphics for it's time. As for paripherials I would suggest a 16x or better DVD drive and if you really want extra get a DVDRW.|`|HLd90MNraa	i wouldn't buy from a store or anything like that,<br>  you won't get that great of a computer.<br>  they make the prices higher than it needs to be for they make profits.<br>  i mean, after charging you for the shipping and all that junk too.<br>  high priced, lower quality.<br>  <br>  if you want the absolute best computer you can get for your money, then i would suggest going to nanafriend.<br>  they're not a big company but they're amazing.<br>  what they do is talk to you, and build a computer personally for you, based on being best for what you want to use it for. best quality you can get for your money, they really know their stuff.<br>  they go by whatever budget you have, and provide a lifetime of support and all that. they're really cheap, you basically only pay for the parts to build your computer. and you can request specifics if you want,<br>  and they go through it all with you and even let you choose your case and all that. they're really cooperative.<br>  i just bought a computer from them a while ago and am extremely satisfied.

I say this because even though Norton is no longer aggressively protecting your computer, if it hasn't been un-installed, it's still an active program. Two anti virus programs running at the same time, have been known to cause a system to crash. Don't know if that's what's happening to yours or not, just thought I'd mention it.|`|7nimzIDsaa	If you would like to try free alternative to anti virus, i would recommend AVG or Avira AntiVir.<br>  <br>  There are a few possibilities that could all contribute to your machine running turtle.<br>  <br>  1) Too much processes running on the backend, go to task manager and see your cpu basic usuage.<br>  <br>  2) Likewise it means that you have insufficient ram power to cater to such needs. Most commercial paid Antivirus in the market are ram hoggers. Like you mention since you have subscribe to a security suite it means the complete package is running simultaneously.<br>  <br>  I would recommend ccleaner to disable and startup task, scan and clean your temp folders and likewise for your registry.

Forget it.  Overpriced hardware and sorry-*** printers.  Personal experience on the printers and I have seen what they put inside their desktop cases.  I can build a better machine for less until it comes to adding an LCD display.  Toshiba was always known to make a good product and Gateway is mistakenly following IBM's proprietary route.  They engineer their pc's so that you can't just go out and buy a replacement part, install it and have it work.

As far as Dell and Acer, someone has to finish last...|`|akvrwpywaa	Well I can't tell you much about HP, Acer, or ASUS computers.  This is what I can tell you from personal experience:<br>  My father has had two Dell computers at his work since 1999.  They still run, albeit a bit slow (but that's probably since they're still on Windows 98SE and are loaded with a lot of software).  I have a Dell Dimension at home that I've had since 2001 (it was one of the first Windows XP computers) and it still runs fine (the CRT monitor did go out about a year ago though, but I suspect that's because I degaussed it too much); I have had a Dell Inspiron laptop since August 2008 and am very pleased with it.  Before that I had a Toshiba laptop from May 2004 until it went out in August 2008, about a month after I upgraded the memory on it (of course).

Video cards that draw more than 75 watts of electrical power are required to have the 6-pin power connector.

I am sure that there is no.<br>  Tell them to control and give the the password of ur facebook and if they notice any flaw in the issue, they can do whatever they'd like to.<br>  <br>  You are going to say now how am I going to give my password for my parents?!?!<br>  I will tell you Yes! You give your password to your parents and you tell them to control it. And there will come a time they'll be habituated to facebook and the internet blogs, so they won't find it that strange to find their daughter on internet.<br>  <br>  Just tell them also that Facebook is a tool of communications between the friends, and not the unknow persons!

CmfmEzb5aa	This isn't a bad gaming PC, but it could be alot better!  If your after a good gaming PC, I would suggest a specific build, PC's from big manufacturers are often not too good to upgrade, for instance, I had A dell E521, AMD x2 @ 2.5g, and upgading was a pain, I had to buy specific memory, and overclocking was a pain as Dell lock the BIOS and other features.<br>  <br>  The first thing I would upgrade on that system would be the RAM. Vista doesn't really like games either! Also, don't forget that the Pentium series is old now, they aren't out of date, but the Dual Core pentiums often use socket 775, which is what the new Core 2 series of processors use, so that could be a bonus.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HLd90MNraa	i wouldn't buy from a store or anything like that,<br>  you won't get that great of a computer.<br>  they make the prices higher than it needs to be for they make profits.<br>  i mean, after charging you for the shipping and all that junk too.<br>  high priced, lower quality.<br>  and most computers you buy will just be 'general' computers,<br>  which are like. good all around, and not specifically for whatever you need it for, which in this case it would be gaming.<br>  <br>  if you want the best computer you can get for your money, then i would suggest going to nanafriend.<br>  they're not a big company but they're amazing.<br>  what they do is talk to you, and build a computer personally for you, based on being best for what you want to use it for. best quality you can get for your money, they really know their stuff.<br>  they go by whatever budget you have, and provide a lifetime of support and all that. they're really cheap, you basically only pay for the parts to build your computer. and you can request specifics if you want,<br>  and they go through it all with you and even let you choose your case and all that. they're really cooperative.<br>  i just bought a computer from them a while ago and am extremely satisfied, i had them make me a gaming computer too and everything runs perfectly. you could even tell them you want it for cod4 and counter strike and they will make sure it works perfectly for those games.<br>  it's definitely the best deal you can ever get for your money, the only other thing that would be any cheaper is to build it yourself, but it would still cost around the same price. they show you everything that's going into buying the parts and all that, all brand new from the company too. check them out, i'm sure you will be very happy with them.<br>  <br>  www.myspace.com/nanafriendpcs<br>  <br>  hope i helped,<br>  good luck!|`|s9Cq9nCaaa	It is an alright gaming rig, a better graphics card would be nice but even my 1.3GHz computer with 1 Gig of ram and a 256MB graphics card can run games like WoW.

0wUwKbHsaa	You don't always know when you need to stop.|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	To get a factorial recursion can save you a couple of lines and a headache.|`|KHSOVxViaa	In general, recursion is a bad idea, compared to iterators.<br>  <br>  If you call a section of code, the CPU has to 'remember' where you came from so you can go back afterwards.  It does this by using a 'stack', a place to store information.  A stack is like a stack of plates; you can add to the top, or take away from the top.  However, stacks do not have infinite capacity - there is a limit.<br>  <br>  If you recursively call a piece of code, each time in you add to the stack; it's like repeatedly piling up plates.  If you keep on doing this you will reach the stack limit, causing the stack to overflow, and the program will crash or cause an exception.<br>  <br>  If you use an iterator instead, that uses one index variable to refer to the iteration.  Each time into the loop you just increment the index.  No extra storage needed.  Hence you can iterate right up to the limit of the index variable.<br>  <br>  When's it good to use recursion?  Whenever it's more convenient to program, the performance is acceptable, and you know it won't overflow.

VwxX8kDRaa	First, you have to stick with the DDR2 because that's what your board supports.  Second, the 1066Mhz will be faster.  Third, your RAM will only go as fast as the slowest stick.<br>  <br>  So only get the 800Mhz if you plan on keeping your RAM speed there.<br>  <br>  In the end, my opinion is to go with the 1066Mhz.<br>  <br>  I'm not familiar with the SLI option.. so I can't offer advice there.|`|CmfmEzb5aa	I agree with the previous answer, the SLi ready RAM is not essential to use SLi, but, in some systems, regardless of if the RAM is SLi certified or not, you can only have 2 RAM banks in use at any time in an SLi configuration. This is something you would have to check with the motherboard manufacturer.

As you are finding out, pick 1 AVG or Kapersky but you can't have both!|`|O8yEuX3zaa	First off AVG free only offers basic protection and it no longer offers free tech support in the free version. I did find a possible work around into quiting down the windows security center alert about not having malware protection but there is no guarantee that it works or causes more problems. The better option here is get a better anti-virus engine that is also known to cover malware protection as well. I have windows Vista with McAfee Total Protection as my current security program and it runs well with the Vista's security center so i would recommend using any McAfee program.

All you need to do to recover the use of it is to reset it to factory specs.  To do that you of course need physical access to the router device itself, not network access.<br>  <br>  There are so many ways to do this with so many different routers that the best thing to do is look in the manual that came with it, or get the manual online at the manufacturer's website.  All of the major manufacturer's have this information available online.<br>  <br>  Once you have reset the router to factory specs you can get into it again by using the default user and password which is specified in the manual.  From there you can set up the wireless keys and such again.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy computing.|`|PEN3hha7aa	as previously mentioned, Read YOUR router manual.  it is not stored in the pc.
qskWsDnYaa	Ok Iv only just started a full time course in maya but Im pretty sure this is how you do it. (If i get the a menu name wrong just go to the closest thing to it)<br>  Go in to 'window' then select 'render' then 'hypershade' the hypershade window will then appear (preferrably tear off the window so you can movie it around). Scroll down the side menu of the hypershade window and select 'file'. Two boxes will appear in the black area of the hypershade window. Selecr the box on the right. Then press Ctrl + a and the atribute editor will appear. In the atribute editor there is a little file button (looks like a folder) you will see next to a text box that will contain the file name. Click on the file button pick your file. Then back in hypershade middle-mouse drag the second box (it should have your file on it) onto your object. If it does not show up, go into the menu in the corner of the actual window your object is in and select renderers and then tick 'high quality render'. Then press '6' on your keyboard and it should work<br>  <br>  I hope this is right|`|bjuVcxN8aa	Try asking that here:<br>  <a href="http://www.simplymaya.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplymaya.com</a><br>  <br>  Great maya site. :)

tOCESHLYaa	Sounds like a trojan that is a DNC<br>   changer<br>  Installing loads the Trojan onto the machine. The Trojan is a DNC changer – in other words, it changes the computer’s DNS server to a new, malicious one that hjacks some Web requests, to phishing or porn sites. This is a smart Trojan, too; it provides different versions of itself, depending on the user’s location.<br>  Under Mac OS X 10.4, there is no way to see the changed DNS server in the operating system’s GUI. Under Mac OS X 10.5, this can be seen in the Advanced Network preferences; the added DNS servers are dimmed, and cannot be removed manually. (Intego is currently testing previous versions of Mac OS X; it is likely that they can be infected as well, since all versions of Mac OS X have the scutil command). The Trojan horse also installs a root crontab which checks every minute to ensure that its DNS server is still active. Since changing a network location could change the DNS server, this cron job ensures that, in such a case, the malicious DNS server remains the active server.”|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Redirected where to?|`|HPv7S1kcaa	It sounds like you might have a virus or a trojan.

They are completely irrelevant for almost every aspect of web design - they've been replaced completely by CSS. Divs are the new tables. The best thing you can possibly do is educate yourself in CSS. What to use where goes like this: HTML is the skeleton of the site. It allows you to create the core of your work. CSS is the muscle and the skin - it puts your elements where you want them and dresses them up so that they look the way you want. If you want dynamic content or cool interactivity, learn a bit of Javascript, PHP, Perl, Ruby or the like. But again - LEARN CSS.|`|AA10357827	<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="960"><br>    <tr><br>      <td align="left" valign="top" width="150">Hello World</td><br>      <td align="left" valign="top">Hello World</td><br>    </tr><br>  </table>

Not being rude, just don't understand what you mean.|`|IbxhRebgaa	You would need two Internet connections to have two external IP addresses. Every device under your router has the same external IP address. Their internal IP addresses, however, should fall in the range of 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  In response to your `Additional Information`:<br>  Just because you have only 1 external IP address, doesn't mean that you can't run a server. You can access your server locally via its internal IP address, which is 192.168.2.3 or, assuming you have forwarded the proper ports, you would be able to access it remotely (from outside your LAN) via its external IP address (the IP of your router). This is normal. I run my webserver this way from a residential connection, as do many other people. It doesn't mean, however, that I have more than one external IP address; it just means that more than one device is using it.|`|0fCxkr41aa	Your referring to the internet IP address<br>  When your router passes information from the LAN to the Internet, it uses a system called NAT (Network Address Translation) so that all data is passed using the single IP address your ISP assigned you.<br>  That is the purpose of a router, to allow multiple machines to access a higher level network<br>  You cannot have multiple Internet IP addresses without multiple Internet accounts, because each account has one and only one IP address.|`|VgwgV5zsaa	Your IP address(es) will always resolve down to a single IP, your internet service providers IP assigned to you.  <br>  <br>  The other IP just indicates you are using a Router and it is assigning IP's so it can recognize them as being on your local network.|`|puzz1Nf4aa	You really won't need to do that.|`|PEN3hha7aa	if i remember right you have an external/wan/internet ip address, one only, that comes into the modem. once it hits the router it does what is called Network Address Translation (NAT).  What that means is the router gives each machine on Your LAN network an INTERNAL/192.168... address that is Different from the WAN/Internet/Public/External IP address that your ISP provides.  If you have 4 computers behind a cable modem and a router they will have internal ip addresses something like 192.168.0.100,101,102,103.  <br>  <br>  If your xp machine and your ubuntu server are on separate cable modems (not likely) then they CAN'T have the same ip address.  the reason an external ip address is unique is to know which pc to go to just like a house number.  there is lotsa software out there  that will tell your internal and external ip address for each machine.  you can also do IPCONFIG/ALL in XP in a DOS shell (start-run-cmd-enter) and it will tell you the address of that machine.|`|cNZFCjb4aa	Probably because your network is a Secured network, so everything on the network is interconnected and shares anything

You can't look at someone else's facebook unless you are friends with them on private, there is no way to look at your pro (unlike myspace).

SJM0rzHtaa	That DVI-to-component adapter will NOT work.<br>  <br>  Those are designed for a graphics card that can output an analog component signal through a special DVI port to connect to a component-equipped HDTV.<br>  <br>  You can't use that adapter in reverse to connect a component output to a DVI display--  The component output does  not put out a digital DVI signal.  If you try to use that adapter that way, you will get no image.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to run three monitors independently from one computer is to use a video card that can support up to four monitors, like this one:  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133165" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  That card comes with two adapters to independently drive four VGA monitors.

qmWEGycFaa	Buy a wireless router|`|PEN3hha7aa	what the hell is wildblue, an isp?  do you have a desktop or a laptop or both?  do you have cable modem, dsl, 56k, T1 or  T3 line?????<br>  <br>  normally if the modem does not have wireless integrated you need a wireless router and a wireless network card or pcmcia card for your desktop or laptop (if it does not already have it built in).<br>  <br>  do yourself a favor and don't buy cheap unless you want to replace parts much sooner than later on average.|`|FgBhymZUaa	You can setup a wireless network through your laptop. If you have xp, just right click your wireless connection and setupand ad-hoc network and use Internet sharing through your wildblue to connect to the Internet. Basically you setup your laptop as a router. You must have a wifi adapter or card in your laptop which you probably do|`|yYuyP1yNaa	Well, your question is a little vague but I'm assuming you mean Wildblue Satellite Internet Service...I'll also assume you want to be able to access this connection in your home from a wireless device like a laptop? <br>  <br>  If so, then you'll want to buy a wireless router - it offers you the ability to plug up to 4 devices into the router as well as connects hundreds of devices wirelessly - yes, overkill for your simple setup but it's the basic way these devices come.  You could go with just a wireless access point but the prices are great for a router and it will give you some nice expandability options.<br>  <br>  You can go with a "G" (802.11g) router or a "N" (802.11n) router.  N is better, faster, less prone to interference etc. but it costs more.  G is probably fine but...well, N is better.  It's a simple cost decision on your part.  I'd go with N if you can.<br>  <br>  Linksys, Dlink, Belkin, Apple all make wireless routers.  The Apple Airport Extreme is awesome but it's the priciest.  Easiest config and is blazing fast.  Linksys and Dlink both make cheap units.  You should spend about $99 reg price.  Belong to SAMS or COSTCO?  They have N routers for about $79 and G routers for about $59.<br>  <br>  The routers will include instructions on how to connect your device to the router.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...if there are more details please share.|`|2CiPsRGhaa	All you need is a home wireless router and each PC in your home must have a wireless network interface card (NIC), which can be purchased separately. Please be sure to secure your home wireless network because if you don't, anyone will be able to steal your Internet access bandwidth and hack into your PC easier.<br>  <br>  Connect your modem to the router, then configure all the PCs in your home that have a wireless NIC installed to connect wirelessly to the router.<br>  <br>  I recommend visiting the links below.|`|iAXI9gmTaa	cut the wires

Do you mean to save it on your computer or to copy the link to post it elsewhere?<br>  <br>  I'll try to answer to the best of my abilities.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to save the banner/picture on your computer, usually a regular 'right click > save as' or 'save image as' would do the trick.<br>  <br>  Sometimes though this isn't possible because of right click protection (happens less these days) or sometimes it's not even an image but some javascript or something similar made to look like an image. in these cases pressing the 'print screen' button on your keyboard does the trick. Once you've pressed the button (sometimes labeled as 'prnt scrn' or 'prt scr') you'll have to open a program like Ms paint or Photoshop and then press CTRL + V (or Edit > Paste). Then use a tool to cut/crop out the part you want from the rest of the image of your screen, and then save it.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to get the url to the image to link someone to it or post it somewhere else (with the person who owns the picture's permission I hope), then viewing the source code is a little overkill. It will work, but a lot more work for nothing. Instead right click on the image and click on 'properties'. In the window that pops up, you should have the link to the image that you can copy and paste where ever.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you can right lick on the image and then click 'view image'. This will show just the image, and the URL in the address bar should be all you need to post the image where ever.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Uh, right-click, save as...?|`|qCtCsGtbaa	Whatever you opened the source code in, search for the:<br>  <br>  <img><br>  <br>  tag.  After you found that, look inside the <...> brackets for the:<br>  <br>  href="jipperish/filename.jpg"<br>  <br>  section.  That is the hyperlink directly to the image inside the quotation marks.  Make sure it is the image you want by copy-pasting the link into a URL bar in your browser.<br>  <br>  More information here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_image...</a>|`|pzY0ARqDaa	You need to find a code such as the <a href="thefilenamegoeshere.jpg"></a> whatever looks like that would probably be the banner you want, and all you do is paste it in your browser. You could also just save the image and upload it to photobucket or tinypic to.

Applications cannot track profile views for users who simply visit another person's profile. Facebook has made this technically impossible.<br>  2. In order to be tracked by an application, you must explicitly agree to allow the application to access your information.<br>  3. Adding an application that provides this functionality is purely optional. If you do not want to participate, please do not add the application to your account.<br>  <br>  Unlike myspace, Facebook's philosphy is to let users view what they want without others knowing what they viewed.<br>  <br>  So you can check out that cute guy/girl with no worries about them finding out, but unfortunately you will not be able to find out who has been viewing yours.|`|9D5E37LPaa	Nope|`|xXanAuLwaa	nah..dont think so|`|a4BTluvGaa	Sadly no :( <br>  I wish there was though :)

IbxhRebgaa	Yeah, that's outrageous. Complain to your ISP. I've heard some horror stories about BT, but never anything this bad. That's worse than 56Kbps dial-up! <br>  <br>  While it's true that the speed test could simply be wrong, you can't argue with the results that you get in practice. If you're consistently getting speeds comparable with those of a dial-up connection, then you clearly have a problem that's not simply one isolated incident. <br>  <br>  It's unlikely, but perhaps they're throttling you for some TOS violation that you are unaware of?|`|uGUvct02aa	my guess is that there is a signal problem with the system or a bad NIC.  Assuming the NIC is good, you'd probably want to give a call over to the ISP and have them come out and measure your signal strength at the point of your modem.  Likely as not they need to install a booster somewhere along their lines.|`|MF1NqduEaa	You should provide more details... <br>  But, if you have a router you should go and check your ports and see if it allows traffic.

Do you want a really inexpensive computer for the kids to use? A small, quiet machine to use as a media computer in the living room? A high-end gaming computer? Or maybe you need a powerful machine with a lot of disk space for video editing. The possibilities are endless, and the type of machine you want to build will control many of the decisions you make down the line. Therefore, it is important to know exactly what you want the machine to accomplish from the start.-<br>  <br>  <br>  - Let's imagine that you want to build a powerful video editing computer. You want it to have a dual-core CPU, lots of RAM and a terabyte of disk space. You also want to have FireWire connectors on the motherboard. These requirements are going to cause you to look for a motherboard that supports: <br>  <br>  Dual-core CPUs (either Intel or AMD) <br>  At least 4GB of high-speed RAM <br>  Four (or more) SATA hard drives <br>  FireWire connections (possibly in both the front and back of the case) <br>  Choosing a Motherboard<br>  Choosing a motherboard is the most interesting part of any building project. The reason it is so interesting is because there are hundreds of motherboards to choose from and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. <br>  <br>  One easy way to think about motherboards is to break them up into a few categories. For example: <br>  <br>  Cheap motherboards: Generally in the $50 range, these are motherboards <br>  You need to decide whether you are building a "cheap machine," a "high-end machine" or a "tricked-out super machine" and then choose your motherboard accordingly. Here are some other decisions that help narrow down your motherboard choices: <br>   <br>  Do you want to use an Intel or an AMD processor? Making this choice will cut the number of motherboards in half. AMD chips are often cheaper, but lots of people are die-hard Intel fans. <br>  <br>  What size motherboard do you want to use? If you are trying to build a smaller computer, you may want to look at micro ATX cases. That means you will need to buy a micro ATX motherboard. Otherwise you can use a normal ATX motherboard and case. (There are also smaller motherboard form factors like mini-ITX and even nano-ITX if you want to go really small.) <br>  <br>  How many USB ports do you want? If you want several, make sure the motherboard can handle it. <br>  <br>  Do you need FireWire? It's nice if the motherboard handles it (although it is also possible to add a card). <br>  <br>  Do you want an AGP or PCI Express graphics card? Or do you want to use a graphics card on the motherboard to keep the price and size down? If you want to go the cheapest route, make sure the motherboard includes a video card on-board (easiest way to tell is to see if there is a DVI or VGA connector on the motherboard). PCI Express is the latest/greatest thing, but if you want to re-use an AGP card you already own, that might be a reason to go with AGP. <br>  <br>  Do you want to use PATA (aka IDE) or SATA hard disks? SATA is the latest thing, and the cables are much smaller. <br>  <br>  What pin configuration are you using for the CPU? If you want to use the latest CPUs, make sure that your motherboard will accept them. <br>  <br>  Do you want to try things like dual video cards or special high-speed RAM configurations? If so, make sure the motherboard supports it. <br>  <br>  If you don't care about any of this stuff (or if it all sounds like gibberish to you), then you're probably interested in building a cheap machine. In that case, find an inexpensive motherboard/CPU combo kit and don't worry about all of these details. <br>  <br>  Buying Computer Parts<br>  Once you have chosen your motherboard, you are ready to choose everything else. Here's what you need to get: <br>  <br>  The CPU that's the right brand and the right pin configuration to fit your motherboard. Pick whichever CPU clock speed fits your budget and intentions. (If you purchase a motherboard/CPU combo, you can skip this step.) <br>  <br>  The RAM with the correct pin configuration that will match your motherboard. If your motherboard is using a specialty RAM configuration (normally to improve performance), make sure the RAM you buy matches its requirements. <br>  <br>  If the case does not come with a power supply, you'll need to choose one. Make sure its connectors match the motherboard. Three hundred watts are enough for most machines, but if you are building a gaming machine with multiple video cards or a machine with lots of disks, you may want to consider something bigger. <br>  <br>  Choose a video card if you are not using the onboard video on the motherboard. Make sure the card's connector is appropriate for the motherboard (AGP or PCI Express). <br>  <br>  Choose an optical drive. If you are building a cheap machine, get the cheapest CD-ROM drive you can find. If you want to burn DVDs and CDs, make sure the drive can hand|`|PEN3hha7aa	monitor, keyboard, mouse, mid tower ATX case, at least a 400 watt power supply (Watts don't matter as much as sustained AMPERAGE on each rail does), ddr or ddr2 ram (kingston, ocz or crucial, in that order of price), nVIDIA or ATI video card, motherboard (INTEL is Very Pricey for the small difference in speed/throughput).  If you only have 600 then get an AMD Motherboard and CPU.  Also need a western digital hard drive (sata or ide), one or two sata or ide dvd burners, a floppy drive if you are smart, mousepad, wrist rest, a CRT monitor and not an LCD monitor ($150 average right there).  check the specs on the motherboard for number of usb ports, onboard sound, integrated network card/ethernet port.  ASUS is a good motherboard but you do pay for it.  Foxconn is really good too and not as expensive.  Don't forget to add TAX and SHIPPING...  Remember too to spend about ten bucks and get basic set of computer tools to put the thing together.  Last and Foremost, before you ever set foot inside the case or touch any printed circuit boards, LEARN WHAT STATIC ELECTRICITY WILL DO TO YOUR MACHINE.  GROUND YOURSELF AT ALL TIMES, AND THAT INCLUDES PUTTING YOUR HAIR IN A PONYTAIL IF IT IS LONG ENOUGH.  Also make sure you have Antistatic bags to lay components on; don't put them on the table without it.  Take your time and be patient or you will have a dead machine before you ever press the power button.|`|rzG4BZfIaa	make sure you have the monitor, keybord, mouse, speakers, you know the hard hardware stuff, and maybe a soundcard if you use them.motherboard, graphics card, and ram is pretty basic, dont forget power supply|`|twSjsTLpaa	how about you buy one.

You'll want to have that checked out.<br>  <br>  Firefox definitely is a better browser than IE though. Once you get used to it, I'm sure you'll agree.<br>  <br>  Firefox is asking you to install flash player (again) because the version used by IE isn't the same/compatible with Firefox.<br>  <br>  You'll want to go here: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:7" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...</a><br>  <br>  Download adobe Flash player. It'll save a file on your computer that you'll have to run to install it. While you're at it I would go ahead and install the windows media player plug in as well as the java one. You'll probably save your self some hassle later on.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest you head over here: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...</a><br>  <br>  and install tab mix plus. It has a nice little feature that keeps everything in one window (I don't remember if this option is on by default) and it automatically opens links to new websites in a new tab.<br>  <br>  It's always rather annoying to be reading an article and they give you a link to more info about something and that link opens in the same window/tab meaning you have to hit the back button (sometimes several times) to go back and continue reading the article. This plug in takes that annoyance away.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  EDIT: At this point I think you're probably dealing to multiple problems. All possibly the result of a virus. I think it's time you back up anything you can't afford to lose (pictures, videos, etc) and reformat your computer. With a clean install of windows everything should go back to working the way it was before (possibly even better than before). I still suggest you use Firefox though :)|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	It could be a virus, but there are other possibilities. First go to windows update and install all updates then try to use internet explorer. Also, if you're running Vista, go to problem reports and solution center and check solutions for problems with IE, that fixes my problems in most times. As to fire fox, make sure you're downloading flash player from adobe.com, if you are just tell fire fox to allow it, maybe fire fox is not allowing it because your security settings are high.

Some people prefer Macs, some don't. Macs tend to be more expensive. They may be simpler to use. This leads some people to say Macs are for dummies. They aren't. Macs may do some things better than a Windows pc but, also, you can do some things on a Windows pc that you can't do on a Mac. <br>  <br>  Some people will also say Macs are immune to viruses. That probably shows their ignorance. For one thing, very few harmful viruses are created any more, even for Windows. Other malware is very prevalent and Macs most certainly *aren't* immune, see:<br>  <a href="http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/articles/2006/02/macosxleap.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/26/more_mac_malware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/26/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/21/stealthier_mac_attacks" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/21/...</a>|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	PC:<br>  <br>  + Hundreds of thousands of applications available<br>  + Low cost<br>  + Easy and inexpensive to upgrade or repair<br>  + Available from many different hardware vendors<br>  - Common target of viruses and malware<br>  - Open hardware architecture makes it easier to encounter hardware or driver problems.<br>  - Less often used for audio/video/image/publishing/music applications<br>  - Installation and use a tiny bit less friendly than Mac<br>  <br>  Mac:<br>  <br>  + Very easy to set up and use<br>  + Almost never a target of viruses or malware<br>  + Integrated hardware and software package makes hardware and driver issues unlikely to cause problems.<br>  + Very nice looking machines<br>  - Much more expensive than PC for equivalent functionality<br>  - Dependent on Apple for both hardware and software with closed architecture<br>  - Available applications only a fraction of what's available on PC<br>  - Poor gaming platform
B17c67APaa	Yes, if you can prove that they have a good reason to be removed.  YouTube's help section may help you report the videos that are harassing you.  Then, the YouTube staff can review the video and remove the video itself or (if the account is deemed bad enough), the account.  Here is the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?contact_type=abuse" rel="nofollow">http://help.youtube.com/support/youtube/...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that helps you out and I hope you stop being bothered.  This happened to one of my best friends once in high school and it can be very nerve racking.  The first step though is to flag the video that harasses you, that way the YouTube staff will be able to review it right away.|`|pzaAIlCBaa	report their asses|`|5yBAMbIZaa	just go to their profile and under their picture there should be a "block this user" option, just click it and they wont be able to view ur profile or send u any messages or anything

7ZfGqo3qaa	If your computer did not come with a recovery CD, chances are the recovery program is stored on a special partition of your hard disk, and you access it by hitting specific keys when starting up the machine.<br>  <br>  Turn your computer off normally, then power it on.  Look at the messages which are displayed onscreen before Windows starts- they will say which keys to press to run system recovery.|`|ULw1777caa	Who did you buy it from?  I suggest calling them for support.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You cannot reformat the system drive without an installation CD.  The system drive is the main drive (the only drive, if you have only one disk drive).  When you reformat, the entire disk is erased, so you must have a CD with an operating system that you can boot from in order to do the reformat, since you're erasing the operating system already contained on the disk.|`|00sMjV8Qaa	How new is your computer? It probably didn't come with disks because there is a installation partition on your hard drive already. When you first turn on your computer does it nag you for something like "F10 for system recovery"? What that means is if you press F10 at the moment you see that, It will take you to a system recovery where it will format your hard drive and restore it to the state your system came to you from when you first purchased it. Remember that this will erase everything so BACK UP and pictures, music or anything that holds value to you if it were lost.  If not Installation disks may be your only option.|`|VgwgV5zsaa	Well you can't really.  You need the disks that hold the actual operating system to used a computer really. <br>  <br>  The driver manager is a seperate partition that can hold the OS from the manufacture but that's assuming you have one.|`|9mVjm7K1aa	If your computer is 4 to 5 years old that is most likely correct.   You didn't mention what the model number.  If it's an HP, most likely instructions can be downloaded from the HP website if you go to Support and type in your serial #.  <br>  <br>  Email with model number and it'll be easier for us to tell you what to do.

Iov5Z7O4aa	Easiest way to solve that:<br>  <br>  1) Presss the play arrow in the middle of the youtube screen to start the video.<br>  <br>  2) Right away, go down to the controls on the bottom left side of the video.<br>  <br>  3) Press (left mouse click) the pause button.  This will let the video load, and your computer memory, and internet connection will be able to handle it at their own speed.  Also, if youtube is under heavy load, it will be able to handle your request easier.<br>  <br>  4) Wait until the little red line that marks the download progress of a video is just a little bit over 1/2 way across the screen, from left to right.  (Center bottom of the little video screen.) <br>  <br>  5) Now press pause/play button again.  (You left click on it with your mouse, once.)<br>  <br>  6) The video is now about 55% loaded, and will start playing from about the first second in.  As it plays the first half for you, it will load the second half, in the background. NO little screen squiggles will appear! <br>  <br>  7) You should be able to see the whole video quite clearly with no problems.  <br>  <br>  Some other video streamers work the same way, and this trick will work there too.  Some will not work. <br>  <br>  Youtube actually has the best video streaming site in the world.  Neither Microsoft (The MSN videos suck! But then, what does MS know about computers, anyway?) your AOl, nor Yahoo, nor Google do as fine a job.

AA12134591	There is the strongest indicator that your system has "lost track" of the printer connection....<br>  The best way to get this 'back online' ...is kinda time consuming.. but, not all that complicated....<br>  Turn your system OFF<br>  disconnect your printer from the computer <br>  (the printer should be turned OFF as well)<br>  Turn your system ON<br>  and..let it boot up WITHOUT THE PRINTER CONNECTED<br>  Once it is completely booted up<br>  Turn off your computer once again....<br>  THEN... reconnect your printer....<br>  and, boot up the computer ... Once it is completely<br>  booted up... turn on your printer... and try this print action again<br>  There is the highest probability that this will bring the printer <br>  'back online'<br>  If this action does not do it<br>  take the problem to the support sector of your printer's company...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  ? ////|`|syKhOl3eaa	Try to print a document like form Microsoft word or word pad and noteapd <br>  if that page prints than its not a problem with the printer ....<br>  <br>  You can try a different browser like Mozilla Firefox, Opera..etc to print from internet.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	I LOVE CAPS< CAPS ARE SO AWESOME CAPS CAPS CAPS> LOLOL CAPS.<br>  <br>  BTW try checking the wires, if that doesnt work go to the website that handles canon printers, your bound to find help there

0wUwKbHsaa	The regular format checks the drive for bad sectors.  The bigger the drive, the longer it takes.  Quick format does not.|`|AA11400382	As far as formatting a hard drive...I never used a quick format because if I get to the point of needing a format then I need to start from scratch and get rid of all junk on the disk.   I think that a quick format is just fixing what is there (kinda like re-aligning your cars front-end)..where formating wipes everything off the disk and you will probably need a boot disk to set it up again.<br>  <br>  Check out the 3 links I copied for you.  Should help you out.|`|1r78EBWYaa	Quick Format: only erases the MFT information of an NTFS disk and only erases the FAT on a FAT-12, FAT-16, & FAT32 disk<br>  <br>  (Full) Format: does read/ write testing of all available sectors/clusters and marks any that fail as bad.<br>  <br>  (°-°)|`|ytl2PONXaa	Quick format just tells the index to write over everything.<br>  <br>  Regular format goes in and writes over the data and then also changes the index to what we know as "0".|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Actually, BOTH of the previous answers are correct. Quick format just reinitialize the File Allocation tables, partition info, etc. A full format tests the sectors by writing to each one, and locks out bad sectors. I always do a full format on a new drive, or one that has been in use a long time. If you've already done one recently as in a re-install, then a quick is probably fine.|`|7e14b6ac44d82559e551d5acc626b3abaa	When you choose to run a regular format on a volume, files are removed from the volume that you are formatting and the hard disk is scanned for bad sectors. The scan for bad sectors is responsible for the majority of the time that it takes to format a volume.<br>  <br>  If you choose the Quick format option, format removes files from the partition, but does not scan the disk for bad sectors. Only use this option if your hard disk has been previously formatted and you are sure that your hard disk is not damaged.<br>  <br>  If you installed Windows XP on a partition that was formatted by using the Quick format option, you can also check your disk by using the chkdsk /r command after the installation of Windows XP is completed.

OdoUdUCkaa	Steps to Change Your IP Address<br>  Operating System Steps to Change the IP Address <br>  Windows 9x/Me users Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network -> Network card -> TCP/IP -> IP address <br>  Windows XP/2k users Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Connections -> Local Area Connection -> Properties -> Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). <br>  Red Hat Linux Go to System Tools -> Network. You could also use tools as 'linuxconf' or 'netcfg'tool. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that different ISP's have different procedures related to IP address changes and if you requested an IP change once and it was approved, it might not be approved so easily the next time.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Shut down the Internet connection and then start it back up (at the modem).  With many ISPs, this will cause you to get a different IP address.  Some ISPs just assign the same IP address again, and only change it occasionally.  You can ask your ISP to force a different IP address, in that case, but they may not have the desire or technical means to do so (it may be fully automatic).<br>  <br>  If you have a static IP address (unlikely unless you've explicitly asked your ISP to give you one), you'll have to ask your ISP to change it.|`|3ZTzrfj2aa	10Pts... whooohoooo!!!!|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Reset cable/DSL modem<br>  -<br>  With a straightened paperclip, press RESET button momentarily.<br>  -<br>  Delete any software specific to the site.|`|AA11284831	Few sites ban users based upon their IP address, since IP addresses change over time.  Most use a seed file or cookie placed on your machine or an entry in the Windows registry.  Changing your IP address won't get past the ban.  And if your ISP assigns IP addresses statically they will normally refuse requests to change your IP address unless you have a strong technical case for changing your IP.  Being banned from a site won't get you any sympathy there.<br>  <br>  In some cases you can get around a ban by creating a new user account on your machine and logging on to that account.  In many cases the seed file, cookie or Registry entry is stored in the user profile and this will get you around the ban.  Needless to say, when you go back and re-register, use a different name, e-mail address, etc.<br>  <br>  If this does not work you may need to reinstall the OS on your machine to get rid of the seed file, cookie or Registry entry.  Some sites plant these in hidden locations and a complete reinstall of the OS from scratch is needed to get around the ban.

pLbTRwNBaa	As the others have said you'll be responsible for any illegal activity<br>  <br>  However there are several other possibly less severe effects which include but aren't limited to:<br>  <br>  1) If the person is using a lot of bandwidth (uploading via torrents for example), it could have a severe impact on your connection speed. Loading web pages could become painfully slow and you might start to lag in any games you play (sometimes to the point of rendering them unplayable). (I didn't mention downloading via torrents in this example because this usually doesn't have as big an impact as uploading (aka seeding) does).<br>  <br>  2) Many internet service providers have started charging for bandwidth usage (being allowed to download/upload Xgb of data each month). Charging you a fee for going over that limit. If someone is stealing your wireless internet and they download/upload abusively, you may go over your monthly limit and incur hefty fees!<br>  <br>  3) Depending on how your computers are set up someone stealing your internet may be able to gain access to files on your network. Like pictures or videos you might have in a sharing folder in order to have access to them from other computers you may have.<br>  <br>  4) If the person is especially malicious they might be able to gain access to private files on your computer.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|IbxhRebgaa	If someone who is using your wireless connection commits a crime on the Internet, you're legally responsible in many countries.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	If they are ,say, down loading child porn,it's your ip that the cops will see.Fire wall it and be safe!|`|T7Apky52aa	Look at it this way: what bad can come from leaving your front door open - even if you're not home?<br>  <br>  Lots of things can cross your internet connection that you have no knowledge or control over and you could conceivably be liable for anything that came over your connection since your ISP isn't going to be able to discern what you did and what someone leeching your connection did.<br>  <br>  For example, if someone used your connection to download child porn, you would be suspected and you'd have an interesting time proving you didn't do that, and that's after you were arrested and your computer equipment was seized.<br>  <br>  Is that bad enough?
dkpIjt5jaa	First of all, it's two different technologies !<br>  <br>  The only thing they have in common is the fact that they are used for connecting peripherals to a computer ( PC or Mac )<br>  <br>  USB was created to replace the many "serial" and "parallel" connectors by a "Universal" method of connecting.<br>  <br>  Firewire (IEEE 1394) was created to be a serial replacement for the parallel SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) bus and also to provide connectivity for digital audio and video equipment.<br>  <br>  The ones most seen in use today are USB 2.0 and Firewire 400.<br>  <br>  The current USB standard (2.0) speed is 480 Mbit/s but it is machine dependent so it will fluctuate (lose some speed) as your computer does other things.<br>  <br>  The current Firewire 400 (IEEE 1394) speed is 400 Mbit/s (more precisely 393.216 Mbit/s or 49.152 megabytes per second) but is machine independent so it is always constant.<br>  <br>  So in the end (under normal use of a computer) Firewire 400 is faster.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are many other technical achievements for both sides and you can find out more by starting here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|ytl2PONXaa	The technology... and speed. .<br>  <br>  This image gives a good example of them and other technologies.<br>  <a href="http://www.jpelectron.com/sample/Electronics/PC-%20Firewire,%20USB,%20SCSI%20Speed.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpelectron.com/sample/Electro...</a>|`|HVN1ui3Zaa	The key difference between FireWire and USB is that FireWire is intended for devices working with a lot more data -- things like camcorders, DVD players and digital audio equipment.|`|NARak4iBaa	Firewire is faster (Can send data to your computer faster)  its built off of the same idea of USB.  it was used mostly for transfering video at first. <br>  <br>  USB 3.0  that comes out in another year well be faster then Firewire.|`|brSfRLspaa	firewire has higher data transfer speeds and also sends power through the cord ad can power a device|`|n1WeAYCMaa	it is a big apple thing, but pcs have about 1 on average now. i also think its a speed issue|`|s5QE13Ahaa	firewire is mostly used in macs these days and are commonly found today in the back of external hard drives so th guy who was first to answer was wrong but fire wire can run up to 400mbps and USB 2.0 Can run up to 480 Mbps and usb 1.1 can only run up to 12 mbps so yeah hope this helps|`|oXb4Wy6qaa	Different formats. FireWire used to be largely an Apple thing (correct me if I'm wrong), but you'll rarely encounter it anymore and most people should stick with USB since it is more versatile and compatible.
MZ1DRSflaa	Are you on DSL?<br>  =<br>  Ensure you have DSL filters on each phone.|`|PEN3hha7aa	try one phone line at a time and dedicate it to the internet and see what happens.  make sure your connectors and jacks are solid too.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Who you have for internet would have been helpful in answering this question. If you are like me, and your ISP is the same as your phone service, than you definitely need to contact your ISP. If the two companies are seperate, and it is just your internet cutting out, then contact your ISP first. Either way, contact your ISP

kJMLIH89aa	Actually you can find RAM online or at a store cheaper than Apple charges you to have it custom added to the system. But on the subject of performance. It shouldn't affect it to much as long as you are not running several applications at once(meaning listening to music, watching a movie, surfing several web pages, and image editing, and playing a game all at once). Basically the more RAM you have the more applications you system can handle running at the same time. If you do end up deciding you would like to get more RAM for your system. You can go to Newegg.com and pick up some more. The current iMac uses PC2-6400 800 mhz RAM. <br>  <br>  Here is 2gb or RAM compatible with iMac for about $36<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134670" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  Here is 4gb (2 x 2gb sticks) for about $72<br>  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820134800" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  <br>  But if you are just doing simple usage you should be fine. If you need more help to make your decision check out an Apple store if you have one locally.

NVIDIA and Dell have the limited and extended warranty to cover this kind of damage if you order it. <br>  <br>  However, it is still important that you try your best not to block the vents. It is in a position where you would be likely to cover it when you put it on your lap (it is where you knee would be). If you're careful, you can easily avoid blocking the vent.
t64wxdcJaa	You have Antivirus 360. Antivirus 360 is a rogue anti-spyware program that uses false scan results and aggressive advertising in order to promote itself. This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it.<br>  <br>  Once installed, Antivirus 360 will be configured to start automatically when you start Windows. Once started, the program will perform a scan, and when done, will list a variety of legitimate or nonexistent files as infections that cannot be removed unless you first purchase the program. What is so dangerous about these scan results is that the files that Antivirus 360 states are infections are actually legitimate Microsoft files, that if deleted, will cause Windows to become unusable. Therefore, if someone believes the results from this program they may manually delete the files thinking they are infections and cause their computer to no longer function. Some files that it states are infections are:<br>  <br>  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe<br>  C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe<br>  <br>  While running you will also see a constant barrage of false security alerts stating that your computer has a variety of security risks. These risks range from files being modified to private data being sent to a remote host. These alerts, though, are false and are only being shown to further scare you into thinking your infected, when in fact the Antivirus 360 program is the actual infection. Unfortunately, these alerts coupled with the Vundo Trojan will affect your computer's performance and you will notice that it begins to operate slower.<br>  <br>  1 Print out these instructions as we will need to close every window that is open later in the fix.<br>  <br>  2 Download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, or MBAM, from the following location and save it to your desktop:<br>  <br>  3 Once downloaded, close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one.<br>  <br>  4 Double-click on the icon on your desktop named Download_mbam-setup.exe. This will start the installation of MBAM onto your computer.<br>  <br>  5 When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, make sure you leave both the Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware checked. Then click on the Finish button.<br>  <br>  6 MBAM will now automatically start and you will see a message stating that you should update the program before performing a scan. As MBAM will automatically update itself after the install, you can press the OK button to close that box<br>  <br>  7 On the Scanner tab, make sure the the Perform quick scan option is selected and then click on the Scan button to start scanning your computer for Antivirus 360 related files.<br>  <br>  8 MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you go and do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan<br>  <br>  When the scan is finished a message box will appear stating the scan is complete<br>  <br>  9 You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Antivirus 360 removal process.<br>  <br>  10 You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the Show Results button.<br>  <br>  11 A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br>  <br>  11. You should now click on the Remove Selected button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br>  <br>  12. When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br>  <br>  13. You can now exit the MBAM program.<br>  <br>  Your computer should now be free of the Antivirus 360 program. If your current anti-virus solution let this infection through, you may want to consider purchasing the PRO version of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware to protect against these types of threats in the future.<br>  <br>  if your infection persists please go to www.bleepingcomputer.com and submit a HiJack This form on the HiJack This forum.
B7THwJxvaa	I highly recommend HD4670. You don't even need a PSU upgrade for it. HD4670 is more powerful than a 8600GTS but weaker than a 8800GT (9800GT). It's nearly equivalent to a 9600GT with less power consumption.|`|cZwMRouRaa	nvidia nvidia nvidia nvidia. dont even think about the ati. ati is like a newborn kitty compared to a fully grown tiger in the game of graphics. Every single gamer or nerd(me) prefers nvidia because it gives the best graphics there is. Most games can only be played by nvidia for example gta IV. I play counter strike 1.6 and source along with dod. Nvidia has the best graphics compared to my old intel 82865G graphics controller. If u worried about the price, never doubt the power of nvidia.

I've been supporting the green camp (nVidia) on my past 2 systems. Due to benchmarks and reviews, i've jump ship to ATi. <br>  <br>  Currently the nVidia GTX295 is leading, but we will sure be expecting something from the red camp a few weeks from now. And the gtx295 is a high end card and pretty expensive, so the overall winner is still ATi.

B17c67APaa	If your laptop gets REALLY hot on the underside, that means the fan is doing its job.  On the other hand, you did say it never did this before and it should not do this when it is charging (I have my laptop on AC power now and the fan only goes for a second every once and awhile).  My personal recommendation is that if you are concerned that something may be wrong, take it to a computer repair shop, explain your problem, and have them diagnose it.  Then, you can have piece of mind knowing whether there is a problem or not ;)|`|HcnXJ2wfaa	You need some one know more about computer and tell them to check it.

The two white ones are PCI.<br>  To remove the blank off you will need to lift up the black plastic piece over them.

The 4650 is a nice budget card, but only costs about $60 in the USA.  Blame Canada, eh?<br>  <br>  Anyway the good news is you have a PCI-E slot, it's the green one.  To remove the black plastic slot cover and insert cards, check on the back of your computer (the outside of the case) there may be a lever or screw holding that into place.  Remove the screw if present- the slot cover should then be easily removed.  Replace it after inserting your video card.|`|UdL4ZCJjaa	Green one is indeed pci-e, as for the covers those look difficult. It looks like at the top of the plastic thing, it could pop off, revealing some screws.<br>  <br>  Edit - looking at your specifications online, it may not be a good idea to get a 1gb ram video card. That will be using all of your ram, unless, of course, your going to upgrade your ram too.|`|GoSYE02kaa	Yes you have a PCI slot. To get the metal pieces out, look at the black bar that goes to the side of them, there is a metal clip at the top of them. This will cause the black bar holding them in place to release open.

zorYTX59aa	There are a few reasons why you'd see the message "This <br>  video is not available in your country" or "We are unable to <br>  show you the original featured video for this channel due to <br>  age or location restrictions":<br>  <br>  Although each country has its own copyright laws, several<br>  nations have bilateral or reciprocal agreements with others <br>  whereby what's applicable in one country is enforceable in <br>  the other. Some countries also share commonality in their <br>  copyright laws. The EU and some elements of NAFTA are <br>  good examples of this.<br>  <br>  Then, there are questions of international dispute, such as <br>  China refusing to abide by anybody's copyright laws. Thus<br>  copyright holders/owners often put limits on the availability<br>  of their videos of where they can play and where they can't.<br>  <br>  There are also issues relating to "licensing". Broadcasting <br>  companies such as CBS, NBC, MTV, BBC and others are <br>  international in scope -- with subsidiaries around the world <br>  which they do not wish to infringe on. The opposite is also <br>  true. They may not worry about their videos being watched<br>  internationally but are weary about what's available in their <br>  own country, usually because of fees and royalties.<br>  <br>  Thus it happens rather frequently that a CBS or MTV video <br>  is available in the U.S. but not necessarily in Canada. The <br>  opposite situation is also true: BBC videos are common in <br>  Canada, but not in Britain itself.<br>  <br>  As such, trying to change your "country" in YouTube's set<br>  of options won't help you in being able to see videos which <br>  are "not available in your country". <br>  <br>  1 -- Clicking on a different country or Worldwide (All) at the <br>  top left of a YouTube page only changes the way YouTube<br>  displays itself to you, such as the homepage; nothing else.<br>  <br>  2 -- Changing the country on your profile/channel page will <br>  only change what people see about you in your profile.<br>  <br>  3 -- Creating a brand new YouTube account (and choosing <br>  a different country) will also have no virtual effect, because <br>  YouTube already knows your country -- based on the IP of <br>  your computer and the previous time you registered.<br>  <br>  4 -- Even if you were to make a new account on a different <br>  computer, YouTube may still know which country that you<br>  are in, based on the known address of your ISP.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but as far as I know, videos which are "not available <br>  in your country" cannot be seen.

Your computer uses physical memory, aka RAM, and virtual memory. Virtual memory is used to simulate more RAM when your computer is reaching its maximum CPU and RAM usage. It very similar to a bucket filling up with water. If your CPU needs water you can bring this resources to it. But your bucket size is limited. The more programs you use and disk space the more water is needed. But you can only deliver the set amount of water because your bucket size is limited. The bucket is your RAM. However, you can use a spare bucket to quickly to help meet the demand. The virtual memory is that spare bucket.<br>  <br>  You can change your virtual memory by altering amount of free resources for your computer to use for it, in a sense making the spare bucket bigger. Virtual memory uses free space as a resource. So you can change the the amount free space reserved for the Virtual memory.<br>  <br>  When you get to the Virtual Memory menu select the Custom Size check box. Then choose the initial size and the max size. Depending on how much free space you have you can choose what that amount of free space you want.

This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it.<br>  <br>  Once installed, Antivirus 360 will be configured to start automatically when you start Windows. Once started, the program will perform a scan, and when done, will list a variety of legitimate or nonexistent files as infections that cannot be removed unless you first purchase the program. What is so dangerous about these scan results is that the files that Antivirus 360 states are infections are actually legitimate Microsoft files, that if deleted, will cause Windows to become unusable. Therefore, if someone believes the results from this program they may manually delete the files thinking they are infections and cause their computer to no longer function. Some files that it states are infections are:<br>  <br>  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe<br>  C:\Windows\System32\alg.exe<br>  <br>  While running you will also see a constant barrage of false security alerts stating that your computer has a variety of security risks. These risks range from files being modified to private data being sent to a remote host. These alerts, though, are false and are only being shown to further scare you into thinking your infected, when in fact the Antivirus 360 program is the actual infection. Unfortunately, these alerts coupled with the Vundo Trojan will affect your computer's performance and you will notice that it begins to operate slower.<br>  <br>  1 Print out these instructions as we will need to close every window that is open later in the fix.<br>  <br>  2 Download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware on another computer and put it on a flash drive. Then put the flash drive into the infected computer, and save it to your desktop:<br>  <br>  3 Install, than close all programs and Windows on your computer, including this one.<br>  <br>  4 Double-click on the icon on your desktop named Download_mbam-setup.exe. This will start the installation of MBAM onto your computer.<br>  <br>  5 When the installation begins, keep following the prompts in order to continue with the installation process. Do not make any changes to default settings and when the program has finished installing, make sure you leave both the Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware checked. Then click on the Finish button.<br>  <br>  6 MBAM will now automatically start and you will see a message stating that you should update the program before performing a scan. As MBAM will automatically update itself after the install, you can press the OK button to close that box<br>  <br>  7 On the Scanner tab, make sure the the Perform quick scan option is selected and then click on the Scan button to start scanning your computer for Antivirus 360 related files.<br>  <br>  8 MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while, so we suggest you go and do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan<br>  <br>  When the scan is finished a message box will appear stating the scan is complete<br>  <br>  9 You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Antivirus 360 removal process.<br>  <br>  10 You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the Show Results button.<br>  <br>  11 A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br>  <br>  11. You should now click on the Remove Selected button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br>  <br>  12. When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br>  <br>  13. You can now exit the MBAM program.<br>  <br>  Your computer should now be free of the Antivirus 360 program.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I have to completely disagree with dhvrm.  A 1mbps connection is more than fast enough to watch videos at full speed.  The problem, though, is that whatever your connection speed to your provider is (and that's all you can "get" - the connection to your provider), you need a good connection to the SERVER you're getting the video from.  And you have no control over that.  (It's like traffic - no one has any control over whether the freeway is all jammed up during the rush hour).  If your connection to the server is slow, start the video, immediately pause it, and watch it when it's finished downloading.  Or get DownloadHelper, download it as a file and watch it later.  (I have a 120mbps connection at my server farm, but I still get slow connections to some servers [under 100kbps] - because that's how the internet works.)|`|AA11434745	If your connection is slow or you are doing other things on the internet at the same time as you are watching videos, the player will occasionally pause because it hasn't downloaded enough of the video to keep playing it.<br>  <br>  To solve the problem, get a faster Internet connection.

Dfr6uA91aa	Proper syntax is the key. Your menu syntax is fine; the only thing that's troubling your declaration of labels.<br>  <br>  First of all, "LblF" and "LblT" should be "Lbl F" and "Lbl T", respectively.<br>  <br>  Second of all, there should be someone to stop the labels from running into each other. You see, labels fall through. That means, if someone chooses "4", it will go to Lbl F, multiply X by 4 (which is computed into the variable Ans), then it will fall to Lbl T, which will multiply X by 2.<br>  <br>  For prgmSAMPLE, here's what it should be:<br>  :Prompt X<br>  :Menu("4 or 2","4",F,"2",T)<br>  :Lbl F<br>  :4X<br>  :Goto D<br>  :Lbl T<br>  :2X<br>  :Lbl D<br>  :Ans<br>  <br>  This way, if the person chooses to multiply by 4, it will calculator 4X (stores in Ans), then it will go directly to Lbl D, therefore skipping Lbl T. The reason why Lbl T doesn't have a Goto is because it's the last label (before displaying), so it will fall through to Lbl D anyway.

dkpIjt5jaa	You must use the exact same card for better performance.<br>  <br>  There is a way to match cards with different memory but this downgrades the fastest one to the level of the other one and NVIDIA does not recommend it. <br>  <br>  <br>  The following information comes from the SLI FAQ page @ <a href="http://www.slizone.com/page/slizone_faq" rel="nofollow">http://www.slizone.com/page/slizone_faq</a><br>  <br>  Can I mix and match graphics cards?<br>  <br>  In order to provide optimal symmetric scaling, SLI technology requires the NVIDIA GPUs to match. For example, a GeForce 7800 GTX must be paired with another GeForce 7800 GTX. Likewise, a GeForce 6600 GT must be paired with another GeForce 6600 GT. However, using the latest Release 80 or later graphics drivers, NVIDIA GPUs sold by different manufacturers can be used together in an SLI configuration. For example, a GeForce 7800 GT from vendor ABC can be matched with a GeForce 7800 GT from vendor XYZ. <br>  <br>  <br>  Can I mix and match graphics cards with different sizes of memory?<br>  <br>  While it is not recommended, NVIDIA does offer this flexibility using Coolbits. When purchasing a second graphics card, you should try to match the memory size so that you are ensured full value and performance from your purchase. For example, if your first card is a GeForce 6600 GT with 128MB of memory, you should purchase a second GeForce 6600 GT with 128MB of memory. However, using Coolbits (value set to 18), you can force both of the cards to use the lower of the two memory sizes and operate together in SLI mode. When dissimilar memory sizes are enabled to work together using Coolbits, the effective memory size for each card becomes the smaller of the two memory sizes. <br>  <br>  Instructions to enable this feature can be found here: <a href="http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone_coolbits.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slizone.com/object/slizone_co...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  The entire SLI zone is here: <a href="http://www.slizone.com/page/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slizone.com/page/home.html</a><br>  <br>  Set aside some hours to explore as it is a BIG place !<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun !|`|NARak4iBaa	It has to be another 8600GT.

dkpIjt5jaa	Here are the XFX ( <a href="http://www.xfxforce.com/en-us/products/graphiccards/9series/9500gt.aspx#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.xfxforce.com/en-us/products/g...</a> ) recommended specs: PCI Express x16 Slot - Minimum 512MB System Memory - PCI-E or PCI-E 2.0 Compliant Motherboard - Full size PC Tower - Minimum power supply requirements: 350W (with a minimum 12V current rating of 18A) - Software: At least Windows XP & DirectX 9c.<br>  <br>  NVIDIA's site ( <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_geforce_9500gt_us.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_gef...</a> ) says the same 350 W Minimum.<br>  <br>  But for the right way of calculating the power a PSU must give out, you MUST look at the BIG picture and take many other things into account not just the graphics card. <br>  <br>  The real lowdown on how much power is needed for PC systems !<br>  <br>  For your reference, following are details that illustrates approximately* how much wattage you will need to run various normal common components in a PC system ( the components are on the left and the wattage required on the right):<br>  <br>  The Motherboard: 15-30<br>  Midrange to high-end CPU: 40-100<br>  RAM: about 7 per 128MB (or 56 W per GB)<br>  PCI add-in card: 5<br>  High-End graphics board: 60-100 (some take more)<br>  IDE/SATA hard drive: 10-30<br>  Optical CD/DVD drive: 10-25<br>  <br>  In this case, the card takes 50 W so 10 W under the minimum norm.<br>  <br>  So let's calculate your system (again, this is an approximation*) with a powerful motherboard, a (High-end) CPU, 4 Gigs of RAM, 3 PCI cards (including this XFX (high-end) graphic card), 1 hard drive and 1 optical drive.<br>  <br>  That would be 30+100+224(128MB X 8 X 4 = 4Gigs @ 7 per 128MB)+15(3 X 5)+50+30+25 = 474<br>  <br>  * It has to be an approximation as I'm missing details of your system.<br>  <br>  So compare your entire computer specs with the list and refine the math on your own, you will then know what PSU you should get. <br>  <br>  <br>  NOTES: <br>  <br>  Leave yourself a bit of slack in your calculation for future hardware - Example: As calculated above, I would consider a PSU of at least 500 Watts and get up to 600 Watts if the price difference is not too much for you.<br>  <br>  Also, always compare PSUs on cost AND caliber, in other words, go for power supplies that have a "quality build" never for one where the cost is cheap (because you can be sure it's not only the price that is that way). Good examples of quality and reliability are brands like Antec, Cooler Master, Corsair and Thermaltake.<br>  <br>  As XFX recommends a FULL tower, it is better to check the dimensions to see if the card will fit without restricting air flow.<br>  <br>  Here are the XFX 9500 GT dimensions (Inches): Length 5.9" to 6.9" - W  2.73" to 4.376" - Height 0.75"  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: My guide is partly based on this link: <a href="http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/powersuppliesGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://static.tigerdirect.com/html/power...</a>|`|fO5JWKMlaa	youre cutting it pretty close.  though i know a ton of people running 8800gt on the dell 530.  which also has the same 300 watt psu.<br>  <br>  it can be done but if your psu burns out youll know why|`|OHXDloIdaa	Maybe.

Going inside the case is all a seller needs to hear to INVALIDATE your Warranty.  If none of the aforementioned is true then find out the brand name, model number and serial number of the computer.

So, I have AVG and it's been doing its job so far.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Ouch, ouch and ouch! none of your 3 options are very good...but then neither was your old McAfee. Sorry.    Please be aware that Windows OneCare is being discontinued by Microsoft in a couple of months. To be replaced by a free product. That should tell you just how good OneCare is!    While AVG is free, It is wildly popular with children, newbies, and the computer illiterate but has historically had the lowest virus detection rate of all the popular free anti-virus programs. Aviod AVG !!    Norton can get expensive...the fee EVERY year adds up. Its good but...  ______________________________________...    Good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"    For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall your old McAfee?)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  You Adware (paid) and Spybot Search & Destroy should serve you decently here.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here. Saving cash these days is important!    Best of luck.

That alone is fairly strange.<br>  <br>  I actually had a problem with this a while back. Explorer stopped working, then Firefox stopped working, then my internet entirely wouldn't connect. The problem I had was due to a virus and I neglected to clean it up soon enough.<br>  <br>  I would recommend running two or three different virus scanners. Not all virus scanners run the same and some will catch things that others don't. AVG Free is a fair one. It's also good to just go through a bunch of reputable virus scanners, download the demos, and use them to clean up the computer. If the viruses have already begun attacking some vital parts of the computer, you may just need to reformat/restore it (That's what I had to do, sadly). Once your computer is sure to be clean, it would be a good idea to purchase a decent virus scanner. Pandasoft is one of the best ones that I've used. Make sure you purchase the CD version of whatever virus scanner you get. If you do have viruses and they end up thrashing your computer, you don't want to have to repay and redownload software that you have already bought, so the CD is a good reusable choice.|`|d60e3f88f20f2a43d815c870747bfe65aa	Tools internet options, connections, lan settings, uncheck all the boxes.

dSaDG765aa	Hello  on this page you get  the solution for your problem!    http://ranpha.wordpress.com/page-1/
FY33nijBaa	it is true partially  when you install program it takes some space on hdd and when you uninstall, the files are deleted automatically but not all files are deleted. some files have to be deleted manually.  so you have to use some specially designed programs which cleans your hdd from temp and unwanted files, to increase the space on your hdd and some registry files to increase speed of the system|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	Technically no because your computer speed is run off of your computer RAM memory which is not the hard-drive. It is temporary memory which is essentially used for the programs you are currently running. Everytime you use a program, your computer fetches it from the hard drive and brings it the the RAM memory to be used for the time being. If you are running a lot of programs at the SAME time, however, this can very quickly and easily slow down your computer.|`|NUCCIFRtaa	There is nothing to do with your hard disks... But try to but a new ram, a bigger ram.. I think your ram too slow...|`|EdP54QBYaa	If you download them, the speed of your internet will slow down until the download is finished. (just a bit of jargon) Genraly I hope you install all your programs ;).     In a way your computer might slow down a little bit. You can always improve the performance of your system when you have a lot installed by giving your computer a defrag.    When your computer has about 5GB left on its hardrive then you'll might see a significant difference in the speed of your computer. But nothing you'll be bothered with|`|tBlLxH5Kaa	Well, it depends on your processor and ram.|`|VAYNwFuEaa	There is truth to that.    The more programs you have running the more of your computers resources are taken up.  Thing to remember is some programs are hungrier than others and take up more resources.  Once all your resources are being used up your computer will appear to slow down.  So, stopping programs frees up resources.    Also, the more stuff you download onto your machine the more space is used up.  If your hard drive is more than 75% full it will also start to affect your speed.|`|I5wje0J1aa	I wonder the same thing. It has something to do with the hard drive space i believe.

So they have to build it.  If you get anything other than what is advertised it will be built.  So this is taking some time.  There is a concern that you need to address.  Do you need the computer now.  Laptops from dell are notorious and have many issues.  I will tell you the truth and say that the laptop is only going to last you two years tops.  Is it really worth the wait.  Do you want to buy from a company outside the U.S. because that is what dell is.  Go to BestBuy and get a mac.  You'll have everything.  Cancel the order because you can in 24 hours.  Go get a PC and upgrade it for half the price.  If you wanna go mac which I advise get one at a store near you.  It is amazing what you can get for nearly nothing.  Don't fret on memory when running Vista.  If you are getting Vista you should throw that computer away as soon as you get it if it doesn't have over 2 gigs of memory or you will wait forever for a startup.  They need to revise what memory is needed to run Vista.

Ideally anyone stumbling over any of these should report them to the site in order to get them closed down, and hopefully contacting the posting connection's owner to inform them of the risks, which then makes the parents responsible for any further cases.

Recent news reports have discussed similar situations with nude photos passed between children via cell phones.  In one of the more recent stories I heard, the girl was 15, the guy 17 and both were being prosecuted as sex offenders.  While I think it is a bit harsh in that particular case (being on a list for life at such a young age), the intent of the law is to protect younger people from someone older (i.e. 13 year old from a 18+ year old for example).|`|vKmHODEhaa	it is but they don't care

There is a place on Myspace called "Classifieds". It's under the More tab at the top of your page. You could list your items there as well. <br>  <br>  I personally list my items on Craigslist first because it is a lot less of a hassle, and then I do eBay.

K6DWA6geaa	My best guess is that you need to reinstall sound drivers for your sound card. So, you'll need to figure out what you have for hardware.<br>  <br>  If you remember the make and model of your sound card (i.e. Soundblaster Audigy) then great! You can go to the manufacturer's web site and download the correct drivers.<br>  <br>  Another route to take is to find out the make and model of your motherboard.  If you know that you don't have an actual sound card installed, then you have an onboard sound controller.  By determining the motherboard's information, you can go the manufacturer's web site and download the new drivers.<br>  <br>  So, check this out:<br>  <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php</a><br>  <br>  It's a little program that will tell you a bunch of information about your computer, including the maker of your motherboard.  Run and install it.  Then click on the 'mainboard' tab and you'll have your information.  Good luck!
ZG6DeAzPaa	From what I can see in your code, "landing" is a character? This must mean somewhere above this you assign landing a value. This doesn't really make sense because you would essentially be doing the same comparisons twice every time you ran it.<br>  <br>  Here is how I would do it. You may or may not be able to adapt yours to fit this.<br>  <br>  step 1:<br>  generate 3 random integers.<br>  ex: 7 7 7 <br>  step 2: <br>  compare the integers, and assign a char code to it.<br>  if((rand1 == 7) && (rand2==7) && (rand3==7) )<br>  landing='a';<br>  step 3:<br>  use a switch statement on the string<br>  ex:switch(landing)<br>  note:make sure 'landing' is of type char [ :P ]<br>  set up your cases:<br>  ex:<br>  case 'a':<br>  break;<br>  <br>  Now, this is not the only way to do this. But it allows for a lot of configuration. For example, if you wanted to reward the player for getting three of the same number, but a different value for three 7s, you could do something like.<br>  <br>  if((rand1 == rand2) && (rand2 == rand3) && (rand1 != 7))<br>  landing='z';<br>  <br>  You see  where I am going with this? You can give special results different "names" and then run a switch on the string. I hope this helps. <br>  <br>  Provide any additional details if there was something I missed or if what I said was wrong/didn't make sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  EDIT: Haha, oops. I guess you are right. I am used to C#, and haven't used C++ for a while. I figured it was the same. I guess another way of implementing this is to go ahead with what you were doing, using characters to represent a "code" and calculate the codes before you do your switch. I will modify the "steps" from earlier.<br>  <br>  The problem with this is that it seems kind of redundant. If you go through a bunch of if statements to get your "code," you might as well take out the switch statement and do your calculations WITHIN the if-else tree. I assume you are supposed to do it this way to practice with a switch statement, so I guess it is fine.

The specs that come with the initial price are ridiculously low (only a 40 gig hard drive, AND a weaker than normal Intel atom, AND only a 3 cell battery, AND only a 4200 RPM hard drive!?!?!).  You'd get more from an EEE PC 1000HE.  It features wireless-N, Bluetooth, a full 160 gig 5400 RPM hard drive, an upgraded intel atom processor, and best of all, an 6-9 hour battery life!  If you don't like the small display, then the EEE PC also comes with a VGA out so you can plug it into an external monitor.

dNvZp8Imaa	Yes its possible.  Its been a couple years so I don't really remember so well.  There should be a tutorial somewhere online.  You will need a couple programs to do it.  First and most obviously you'll need the mp3 of the song you want to do.  Then theres a program called Sony Acid Pro which you need to beat map the song(should be free version somwhere.).  Really it just spits out a number thats the tempo of the song.  Then you need another program called X-step.  You enter the number into this program and it will make the DWI file which is the actual stepfile.  Then you go into stepmania and make it from there.  Thats all I really remember its been a couple years since I last played that game.  Thats pretty much the gist of it.  Good Luck.

Vt0xnuWpaa	The best thing you can do is update your video drivers. There's not much else you can do for most laptops.<br>  <br>  Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.<br>  <br>  Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades. Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style.<br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.<br>  <br>  There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.<br>  <br>  However, because of the slower transfer bandwith through the ExpressCard port in comparison to the PCI-E x16 GPUS usually use, they will not perform nearly as well as built-in/native cards.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/mobile/18/asusxg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...</a><br>  <a href="http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/asusxguh9.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...</a>|`|B7THwJxvaa	Unless your laptop has an MXM slot (it's usually the "gaming" laptops that have this; the MAJORITY does not have this), then you cannot upgrade your laptop's graphics card.|`|Syn2excFaa	You can't upgrade the video card but you can get a better processor and get more ram. Try running it at the lowest resolution and video settings and you may be able to play it. You can also try to allocate more video memory from your ram in bios but this may or not work for you.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	You can't.

zorYTX59aa	YOU MAYBE DID THE HORRIBLE MISTAKE OF FOLLOWING THE <br>  DREADFUL ADVICE OF THOSE 2 "ZILLATUBE" MEN WHO KEEP <br>  TRYING TO SUCKER PEOPLE YOU INTO BUYING THEIR BOGUS<br>  AND UNNECESSARY "ZILLATUBE" SOFTWARE. THEY USUALLY<br>  TRY TO PASS THEMSELVES OFF AS SOME GIRL CALLED "JOY" <br>  OR "B. LOVE".<br>  <br>  It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens<br>  and players that are blank or all black. Thus, I recently spent<br>  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of<br>  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to surmise<br>  is that there is no definitive solution out there. However, there<br>  was one interesting factor in nearly everything I saw:...Firefox.<br>  <br>  A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to<br>  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same<br>  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly<br>  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-<br>  computerese" that I would not dream of recommending those<br>  potential fixes.<br>  <br>  However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible<br>  solutions, so check these out:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a Mac and are using Firefox, apparently logging<br>  out of YouTube restores everything.<br>  <br>  2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:<br>  go to → Tools → Quick Preferences → Edit Site Preferences<br>  → Network tab → Browser Identification → Identify as Firefox.<br>  <br>  3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a<br>  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).<br>  <br>  4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet <br>  connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote <br>  that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left <br>  corner of their browser screen.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you. <br>  If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,<br>  please feel free to type any of these into Google's search box:<br>  -- youtube "blank screen"<br>  -- youtube "blank player"<br>  -- youtube "blank box"<br>  -- youtube "black screen"<br>  -- youtube "black player"<br>  -- youtube "black box"<br>  <br>  If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise<br>  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird: <br>  Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary <br>  Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has <br>  solved 100's of people's YouTube problems, so why not yours.<br>  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options > Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  The only other ideas I can think of are Flash and Google Web<br>  Accelerator. The most recent versions of Flash are frustrating<br>  lots of YouTubers. Updates are typically good for only 1 thing: <br>  software conflicts. If you are using 1 of the 5 different versions <br>  of version 10 (yes there are 5), you may want to consider this <br>  other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  As for GWA, if it's on your computer, dump it, burn it, trash it, <br>  disable it, uninstall it.

Are all the parts compatible with the board?  Did you check to make sure there isn't a screw underneath the motherboard shorting it out?  start all over and that means verifying the power from the power cord, verify the power supply voltages,  all the connections.  I would start the machine with only a cpu-no video card. no ram, no drive of any kind plugged in.

(again see specs.)|`|drqw3sdzaa	go for it.|`|xdlsGvldaa	Upgrading the ram will not cause you to loose any data, files etc. on your lap top. Make sure the new ram memory modules are correct (same specifications as the old except for size) and do not exceed the maximum size for your lap top. Unplug, turn off and remove battery then remove the chip set cover, press the clips on each side and pull out the old ram memory module at about a 45 degree angle. Reverse procedure for installing the new memory modules. If you install the wrong ram memory modules it can cause a system crash/failure. After installing the new ram and replacing battery plug it in, power on, and it will recognize the new ram and load the operating system and you are ready to go. <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.frys.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.frys.com</a> click on the tab at top hard drive/memory and find the size and price. I just purchased 4 GB ( 2 x 2 GB) for my lap top for $35.00, Crucial brand and it works fine.<br>  Hope this helps
T17pbHVJaa	You don't.    And no proxies should work either.      School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.    All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.     You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.

Also have "FRESH Proxy DAILY" at http://needbrowser.com VIA "FEED EMAIL" or visit the site to get fresh proxies listed daily.

NkbhHcIAaa	as soon as the coffe shop finds out your accessing their account with out permission they will WEP it call the police and have you prosecuted|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You can not. The router must have a line before it can work. And unless you tell the owner of the network what you are doing and get written permission form both them  and their ISP to use this service you are stealing. An internet cafe connection is only licenced for use within their building, and then only for temporary use for any machine not belonging to them and inside their premises. Because some wireless owners were not controlling illegal use, it is now internationally agreed that the use of it by persons outside of their building is stealing a subscription from the ISP. Many ISPs have already prosecuted for this, none has lost a case. You can get 5 years in prison for every connection. Also using an unencrypted connection means anyone nearby can read all your transmisions. This means all your clear text user names, passwords, emails and sites visited become public. Many identity thefts are carried out this way, and owners of wireless who leave it open may well do so in order to steal information from illegal users, who can then never report the thefts.|`|arE6NuOXaa	You need a wireless device on the computer itself not a wireless router.

Your best option would to sign up when they open their doors to the public.  I saw it open for a few hours a day from 26th to 29th Jan, a shame you missed it. Previous to this it was open for for 2 days that ended on the 21st Jan.  Open Registration days can be any day of the week, are not necessarily every month and can last hours or days.  I'd advise you to check the site EVERY day and eventually you will get there.  If you can't get an invite you will need to follow this path, good luck.  Please try and keep your share ratio above 1.1 when you get in.    You may find this tool useful, it's called Tracker Checker and you can leave it running in the background - http://www.stamcar.com/2007/07/25/tracke...  If you use this tool you will need to edit a few trackers, the Demonoid one needs the 'find string' changing from 'sername' to 'Desired username'    EDIT: http://demonoid.com is now open for registation so be quick.  Look out for the activation email that may come to your spam/bulk folder. This will be from Gate_Keeper and not Demonoid.

UAYzLyN4aa	Unfortunately the manufacturers think that small is not only beautiful, it is (and should be) expensive. They cut the price on the netbooks by leaving things out... like DVD drives and memory expandability. This way the cheap netbooks don't erode the market for their high-end subnotebooks.     The netbooks will work with a USB-connected DVD drive, but if you want a small and light machine ("subnotebook") with built-in DVD you are going to pay a premium price for it.|`|dTVMq4VPaa	The netbooks are the only things available in that price range... and Dell is supposed to have a 12" netbook. Here, check them out. It's the only think in your price range. Asus also has 12" laptops. I know cuz I have one... the U6 series. But... definately more $ than you want to spend.
aab8fee4bb00a3a37d38643f4e296de7aa	I can't explain why you need to add that because I don't know what the form is supose to do and I haven't seen the code.    I can tell you when you add something like    ?page= you're sending the PHP from a variable through an encoded URL. So I assume the PHP form needs to know the variable URL of PAGE to know exactly what to do next.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Look at the php file.  You should see something like ['page'] somewhere near the top.  (Let's hope it's in a line with isset( - otherwise it's a good thing that you can't get the programmer.)    The php code is looking for the name of the page that called it - evidently more than one page calls it, and it does different things for different pages.  It's a good idea if you have a few pages that need almost the same code - it saves file space.|`|AA10834300	Your PHP script file will be sitting somewhere on your server and it has been written to perform a certain function.    Your PHP script clearly needs some kind of input before it can work. Just linking directly to the PHP page will not provide this input it will just display the script and probably an error.      If you did a normal hyperlink as you suggested you would only get a link to the script file and nothing else.    In the example you posted:    sendtoform.php?page=    (Just in case you are not technical a URL is another name for a web site address)      So it might be something like:    sendtoform.php?page=http://www.bbc.co....          The bit after the question mark (?) is the input for the script, so that is key here. The parameter page=  is the input that the script requires to work.    You would replace  with whatever is supposed to go there.    So you put input into a script and you get some response out. If you don't give any input you don't get a response.    You didn't explain what the script is supposed to do so its difficult to answer the question or make a judgement - but basically your script needs input to make it work and the method (using the question mark is one way to pass the input to the script).    It's saying sendtoform.php run with parameter page=    Where you put whatever needs to go after the equals sign.        I hope I've understood the question and responded accurately - if not post some clarification to your question.

Use "Make .mde file..." in Access to create a .mde, which is not editable.     The MS Access runtime is free, at Microsoft website. Previously it was only available in MS Office Developer.

The .mdb contains all the queries, reports, and data for the project.  Windows Access prior to Office 2000 did not have the ability to discriminate the different user permissions.

eYn7maNTaa	Hi, I have Vista but not had the same problem as you. However, to get the web address of those you have listed, left click on 'Favorites', then right click on each individual entry. When the box appears click on 'Properties' - this will display the web address for you under 'Web Document'.  Also in the same box you will see 'Change icon' - left click and select what you want.  Sometimes when icons appear only as IE, it means that your desktop system may not have loaded totally. Switch off and restart your computer.   It may be time to do a 'de-frag on your computer, get rid of any files that could be clogging it up and cut back on any unwanted 'Favorites'.  If you've still got the same problem try 'Live Search' top right corner of your browser.  Hope this helps. Good luck.

fmT3ochSaa	If you turned NAT off you probably also changed the IP Address on the router. Attempt to go to a  command prompt and type ipconfig /all and enter. This should list a default gateway, type the default gateway address into the browser and the page should open. If not I would do a factory reset on the router.    For the Xbox Live issue you don't need to turn NAT on. What you need is to set a static IP Address on your XBOX and put the static IP into the DMZ section on the router. Depending on the connection you may need to put the router in the modem as a DMZ as well.    Hope all this helps.

The first is easy: millions of "web Designers" throughout the world do it:  - They buy (or pirate) a software like Dreamweaver;  - They try to find free webhosts that offer free web-design programs;  - They do not write code: they use drag and drop: that's all they can do;  - They can offer "websites" for 10-15$ a page...  - They CAN'T make a site to work properly...  The second is more demanding:  - They have seen EBAY, Yahoo Answers, their Email server, some 3D games;  - They have seen a huge number of totally uninteresting blogs and forums;  - They asked some "web designers" some prices, and have received quotes for 100$;  So... They analyse what they want, and it always comes to an "Ebay" type;  - They want it for 100$ and can't understand WHY it is worth several THOUSANDS of whatever currency...  - They go to freelancers sites, and place a request;  - They choose the cheapest quote;  - They repost three months later, because the designer did not "supply the goods", and ask a new developer "just to finish the job";  The third way is the right way, but it is NOT an easy one!  - The developer uses a simple text editor and some graphic design program (like Photoshop);  - The developer has learned (over MANY years), HTML, XML, DHTML, Javascript, Php, Perl, MySQL, IIS, ASP, ASP.net, AJAX and java;  - The developer has a good understanding of MARKETING, acquired by studies or experience;  - The developer has a good exprience in Search Engines AND in browser Engines (to make his sites WORK on ALL engines, at ALL resolutions);

The drives are always removed and installed through the front of the case, since the CD tray has to be accessible through the front. If more than one bay is available, it doesn't matter which bay you mount the drive in, though I favor lower bays for a lower center of gravity and shorter cable reach. If you've forgotten to disconnect the power, IDE or audio patch cables from the back of the DVD drive, you'll find out at this point when it doesn't pull out easily:-)  <br>  Both CD and DVD drives, and their recorder (burner) equivalents, are almost universally parallel IDE drives. There are more expensive SCSI drives available for very specific applications, normally arrays, but we won't cover them here. Parallel IDE drives are equipped with Master/Slave jumpers which allow the IDE controller to address two separate drives on a single channel. The drives feature three jumper sets, Master, Slave, and Cable Select (the cable wiring makes the selection). The easiest to ensure a newly installed DVD burner will be addressed properly is to put it next to the old CD drive and make sure the same jumper pair is selected.    <br>    The CD burner is then installed in the case, and secured with four screws. If you do this with the case standing up, make sure that the CD drive is actually supported on the bottom as you slide it in, because some super-cheap cases just have an open cage, and the drive can drop out of your hand and damage the motherboard. Since the faceplate of the CD recorder will open to front of the case, it's important (for aesthetics) to make sure it's flush with the front facade before tightening the four fine thread screws.  <br>  Now we'll show the CD burner connections one at a time, keeping in mind the are identical to the connections for a CD ROM, DVD ROM or DVD recorder. The first connection to make when you install a CD drive (because it's at the bottom and hardest to get at) is the audio lead for playing music CDs, which attaches to the sound card. See Installing a Sound Card for attaching the other end.If you skip this step, everything will work properly, including sound for games, but you won't be able to play music CDs.    <br>    The 40 wire IDE ribbon cable may be keyed to the connector on the CD burner, or you may be able to force it on backwards. The red wire on one side of the flat ribbon goes to the "Pin 1" end of the connector on the CD drive, and if the drive isn't labeled, the red wire should go next to the power connector. If the CD drive isn't recognized when it's installed check that the other end of the cable is properly installed on the motherboard. Finally, the power connector (below) is seated firmly over the four large pins in the connector, usually goes in about a half an inch. The power connector is keyed so you can't get it wrong. Now you know how to install a CD drive, all that's left is getting it to work with Windows:-)|`|7Qpdm6rFaa	May be one setup file <br>  <br>  Mostly your operating system will automatically detect driver<br>  <br>  else install driver for that operating system|`|sKLri6mhaa	One file only, which is automatically read by operating system from ROM chip located on CD/DVR ROM or Writer as soon we plug it which includes model name of that cd rom/writer as well.|`|oqvIuHB1aa	just 1 a driver file. usually a something.inf file.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|loih5xxraa	lmao.

ZG6DeAzPaa	Hey, good to see you are excited about increasing your programming "vocabulary." <br>  <br>  What platforms do you like developing for? <br>  It seems like you do a lot of web stuff, which is not really my thing so I can't advise you on that. <br>  <br>  I can, however, talk about some of the other languages you mentioned. <br>  <br>  C++ - This is a useful language to know... but I am not really a big fan. I actually prefer good ol' C to c++. <br>  <br>  Learning C really gives you an insight into computer science. It is relatively low level compared to the other stuff you learned, but if you can master it... you will be a better programmer for it. <br>  <br>  Both C and C++ are compiled with the gcc compiler. Here is a quick "hello world" for both.<br>  <br>  C++ : <a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_54.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gcc...</a><br>  C: <a href="http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/c/hworld.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/cours...</a><br>  <br>  Java is for more than just phones.... understanding it would also result in you knowing a lot of javascript, as well as give you the ability to write java applets. Personally, I don't care for java.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite was C#. It is based on C, and made by Microsoft... It is a very easy language to use with a ton of built in stuff. You have all sorts of resources, such as XNA, to give you an introduction to programming games for Windows/Xbox 360. It is free to download: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Express/</a><br>  <br>  Hmm... up-to-date? not really sure what you mean by this. All of the languages you and I mentioned are still being maintained. C# is the most "high level" language on the list, followed closely by java.<br>  <br>  I would definitely recommend learning C at some point though. It is likely what you will use in college, if you choose to go and will provide you with a deeper understanding of how computers work.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HlgSu0ZJaa	If it was me choosing to learn a new language I would learn Javascript for CSS, cause sometimes you need to know javascript for CSS.

az2ZBy3iaa	9400GT is waaay too weak and will probably bottleneck your CPU. Get the 9800GTX or HD4850 instead. It'll be worth it, I guarantee.<br>  <br>  Consider getting something better for your mobo and CPU. 750i with a Q9400 or Q8200 would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  I'd go for the PNY RAM, but if price is an issue, w/e.<br>  <br>  And the PSU is not powerful enough if you want to upgrade later on. Consider getting a 600-700W one.|`|Zj7RHtoUaa	your motherboard and cpu are ok. The 9400gt wont be enough to play any graphic intensive games. You may be able to play games like cod4 and cod5 on low to medium settings. I would recommend getting at least a 9600gt, its much faster than the 9400gt with only a bit more $. The kingston ram will be fine if you do not plan on overclocking, and just need it to work. You should get about a 500W power supply, i know even 400W is enough, but just to have room for upgrades later on, its better to have more watts.|`|FbEs0eKdaa	Before you buy anything compare prices on Newegg and Tigerdirect.<br>  <br>  ZipZoomFly doesn't have very good prices for what they have.<br>  <br>  $2 more and there's a 750a on Newegg, one that can actually SLI.<br>  <br>  And yes all those are compatible.<br>  <br>  But up the 9400 to a 9600 at least.

yOwRD4ZEaa	Either you need a router with a stronger signal or you need a better wireless card for your laptop. I have a great router but my laptop is 3 years old. Wireless technology has improved greatly since then and it was definitely worthwhile to get a new wireless card for it. If your laptop is new, the router is more likely to blame. Move it to a better location or upgrade the router.|`|AA10146029	because ur using wireless signal. its stronger downstairs because the signal strengh is higher since im guessing ur routers downstairs. what i would do is either stay downstairs, move the router to maybe a spot between that would work (but you may need some wall plugs that wouldnt be there) or buy a new router and ask the sales rep to guide you to one that fits ur needs (see how far away ud be from the router) there are routers that i know that can easily fit an entire house with a strong signal strengh.|`|xdlsGvldaa	The router signal range is not strong enough to reach all area's of your home. Solutions, move router to a more central location in home, buy a new router with better signal range, buy a signal booster for the router.<br>  Hope this helps|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Concrete ceiling in the basement.

AA10843250	It is NOT possible for someone to track your computer through MySpace. MySpace does not reveal the proper information in order for someone to track you, let alone hack you. You need an IP Address of the remote system (your computer) to hack, and it cannot be retrieved through MySpace.<br>  <br>  Another thing:<br>  <br>  Don't disclose the exact town you live in. Set your location to the major city closest to you. If there isn't really a MAJOR city close to you, use your state's capital. If you live there, then find a city about 50-75 miles away and use it. =P For example, I live in a small town 50mi. east of Nashville, TN. I don't care to disclose my real town, but if it were you, you could just say "Nashville". Or "Chattanooga".<br>  <br>  MySpace is a safe community. Tell your mom that it's NOT MYSPACE that causes victimized kids to become the victims. It's the kids themselves who cause it. They give out revealing personal information that will allow a predator to track them down. IT'S NOT MYSPACE'S FAULT!<br>  <br>  People watch the news and see that a young teenager was tracked on MySpace, and was almost attacked by the predator. What these people fail to realize is that it's the teenager's fault for not paying close attention to details. If someone you don't know starts talking to you simply DO NOT disclose ANY revealing information. (Real location, name of your school, anything that is SPECIFIC to your town) For example, if you have some local businesses, that are found NOWHERE but your town, do not name them to the person.<br>  <br>  Also, tell your mom that you can set your MySpace Profile to "Private". And the only people who can view your profile (including location) are the people you add as friends.<br>  <br>  Also, tell her you can REQUIRE someone to know your e-mail address or full name before they send you a friend request. =)<br>  <br>  This should help you a lot. If it works please let me know. Just send me a message here. =)|`|iaUo3tvMaa	I hate Myspace and everything else related to profiles online. It is unsafe, people CAN hack you because Myspace is vulnerable in that way and your personal information is as public as any other profile webpage.<br>  <br>  If your mom does not let you register Myspace, then she is being a good mom and I would take her advice and stay away from these sites.<br>  <br>  It is unsafe like I said earlier because you will get many messages from strangers and you might someday believe one wants to be your friend but you will actually be talking to the complete opposite of who they say they are. It is important you understand the dangers of giving your personal information online.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|GYij4N13aa	Well, you know the reasons why your mom says no! Well..people get tracked because they reveal too much. For ex., don't EVER put your real age, address, etc. It's said that a person can guess a password by just knowing what kind of person you are. Someone can hack you when you click those stupid "macy's gift cards" and all those BS ads or when you're asked to enter your myspace user/password or email address in some site, don't do that as they're are fake sites to steal your login info. Also, never add people you don't know and keep profile private. If you can prevent all those things above, then you should tell your mom that you won't do all these things and maybe she might let you have a Myspace ;)|`|lqIgEpg1aa	LISTEN your mother is right, those types of sites are bad. there are child rapest that could hurt girls like that and your mother is trying to protect you from that harm. YOu should listen to your mother, maybe instead of sitting on the computer talking on myspace maybe you should join a group like karate or ice skating, something fun and more interesting then stupid myspace.  Yes someone could hack your computer if they know your information its not that hard, just because your friends have a myspace doesn't mean you have to have one. Listen to your mother she knows more then you do, you don't want to be like all these other girls, your mother is only doing what she is suppose to and thats to protect you so be thankful that you got a careing mother like her.|`|HhXkjEtJaa	My mom was against myspace too.But i told her that you can put your profile on private so only your friends can see it.and that pretty much sold her on the deal.Plus she trust me.anyone can track you and hack you.someone can even hack into your computer.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|m9bRpmN4aa	Your mom is overreacting. Tell her to relax. Yeah, a lot of kids and teenagers have one these days, even kids that are like, 11 years old, which is not allowed anyway.<br>  <br>  It's not AWFUL, depending on how YOU look at it. Your mom just might be worried that you're on this website where people can see all over the world and your not little anymore, your growing up and wanting your own things, all that mom stuff they think about.<br>  <br>  There are trackers that can hack people's computers and sites, and they can take your passwords, thats true. But who would want to go and make an effort to hack YOU? You're just a regurlar person, right? Say, if you were someone of danger or someone that a lot of people KNOW and DESPISE, then you'd wanna be careful of hackers. You don't even have an account yet, so this is an overreaction.<br>  <br>  MySpace is for people aged 14 years old and over ONLY, so you at least need to be that age to have one. If you think it'll help, tell your mom that she can monitor your myspace usage whenever you go on, and she can be in the room when your online, so she can see what you're upto. Tell her you'll have your page set to 'Private' so only your friends can view your page, no strangers, unless you have it on 'Public'. Allow her to check with you whenever you recieve a new friend request, to see who it is, and if she would want you to have them on your friends list. This all may seem annoying at first, to have your mother watching over you when you log on, but trust me, it does work and it keeps the parents less stressed out.<br>  <br>  Let her know too, that myspace isn't just for having a bunch of friends and pictures and talking online, it also promotes things like charities, breast cancer awareness, and causes. Also promoting local musicians and unsigned artists, with a lot of music and videos and also competitions.<br>  <br>  MySpace isn't all that bad at all. Relatively safe. Even MUCH more safer if your mom is watching over you whenever you go on. But hey it beats not having a myspace at all. I went through the same thing with my mom when I was 15, but now I can go on whenever I like, and my mom likes it. She even has her OWN myspace too.<br>  <br>  Let her know that as long as she is monitoring your usage, you'll be safe. And make a deal with her - if something were to go wrong on myspace just ONCE, after you make an account, then she can tell you to delete it. It might work if you say that, it did for me at first :D<br>  <br>  Okay, good luck (:|`|cD6J0JMPaa	Myspace Is For Mature Teenagers,& Yes its Dangerous Because there are some POSERS(People who pose as other people) & people lie about their age a lot,You could end up talking to a so called 13 year old girl but with no pic she could be a 40 year old perverted man,Myspace is a CHAT ROOM,So if your planing to have one then heres some safety tips Dont add people you dont know,just your friends,make your page private so no internet perbers can get your info,dont upload no more than 3 photos of you,make sure you put that people know your last name so they can add you,myspace CAN Be safe,but only if you fallow the rules,go to myspace.com & read the rules with your mom,maybe that will convence her
