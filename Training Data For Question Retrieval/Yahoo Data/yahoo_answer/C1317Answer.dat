Positive velocity would be moving forward - wherever you determine that is, and negative velocity would be traveling backwards.    For example, let's say you're driving down a straight road to your friends house two miles away.  You drive one mile at a velocity of +30 mph before you realize you left something at home and turn around driving 30 mph (the same speed) back to your house.  But because it's in the opposite direction, you would say -30 mph if you were asked for velocity.|`|HBUO10i7aa	THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE IN A DREAM AND YOU'RE FALLING BUT ONLY IN YOUR MIND, SO IT'S ONLY RELATIVE TO THE DREAM AND THERFORE A NEGATIVE STATE........|`|vIcGZ4h7aa	Velocity = distance / time    If you travel backward for 5 meters / 1 second.... this is the same as traveling -5 m/s.|`|FaUNEDG6aa	I think you might mean this:    Velocity is defined as "It is a vector physical quantity; both speed and direction are required to define it."

K6QlFoo0aa	W "lives on" [0, 1]  since 0^2 = - and 1^2 = 1 and the fraction in between when squared are greater than 0 but less than 1.  This is based on the fact that for all real numbers r between 0 and 1, r > r^2  and r > 0.    Technically speaker there is no probability density function.  This is a concept from calculus - this function of your is not everywhere differentiable and that being differentiable is an absolute requirement for there to be a probability density function.  No step-function is differentiable.  ---------------------
1khVEE6oaa	Okay, so set up an equation:    0.25 * 2^x = 1,000,000    I used this because you are doubling 0.25 every year.  So you're multiplying it by 2 over and over again.  So 2^x can explain that progression.  Just think, in year one, you have 2^1, which equals 2, so you just double your $0.25.  In year 2, it's 2^2, so you multiply your original 0.25 by 4.  Each year it gets doubled again because you add one to the exponent.  Anyway, let's solve.    0.25 * 2^x = 1,000,000  2^x = 1,000,000 / 0.25  2^x = 4,000,000    To solve for an exponent:  x*log2 = log 4,000,000   x*0.30103 = 6.60206  x = 6.60206 / 0.30103       ANSWER: 21.9315682|`|ngfPNolpaa	Forever!|`|nOf0RPitaa	$.25 per hour?  per day?  per month?

It is the chemical properties of copper and gold that make it colored. This is due to the electrons of copper and gold (not just the valence electrons).    Essentially, energy is released in the form of light (photons) when an excited electron drops down to a lower energy level. It goes into the higher energy level when it absorbs energy (mainly wave energy). Gold and copper are unique in this sense because they have a specific energy level which allows for them give off their color when it's electrons are dropping to lower energy levels.

The transformer is designed to step down the voltage at a given frequency by a given ratio. At a higher frequency it will fail to do this to the same ratio. This would be very bad news for your PDA. And possibly for you.|`|AA11975969	I think your main concern is how well the power supply circuit works in the units you use. If they are good, they should output an almost flat DC voltage with no ripple.  But transformers are more effecient at higher frequencies and might cause the power circuit to heat up more and the ripple voltage would be increased substantially due to the 400 Hz..  The filter capacitor in the power supply circuit might not be the right value now to stop the ripple. If that gets through to the rest of the circuitry it could cause damage. Not to go into detail about capacitors, their value depends on frequency.  Most all the work done to convert 110 VAC to the DC voltage is done by the wall transformer which is the power supply.  It contains a transformer at least 1 to 4 diodes, a capacitor and maybe a regulator IC. Here is what you can do. Build a box that will accept all your plugs with the proper polarity and put a capacitance multiplyer circuit inside. Lot of work. Do this instead .. take a car battery charger, hook it to a small car battery, then hook up a 60Hz Power inverter to it.  The kind they use for camping and RV's. Get one at an auto supply house as well. That way the final result is 110-120 Vac that you can use.  Because transformers are more efficient at higher frequencies, check the output of the ccar charger to see that its not over say 15-16 volts. You could monitor the battery voltage, and when it drops to 11.8 volts to 12 vvolts, turn on the battery charger(do this if the voltage from the charger is above 15 volts).  Dont want to overcharge the battery.  Battery voltage will normally be around 12.5 volts.  This setup is cheaper than a new PDA. Doesn't your plane have a 24 volt battery? reduce that to the levels needed.

Slo en los ltimos siglos se ha propuesto averiguarlo sirvindose del mtodo cientfico. Y slo en las ltimas dcadas ha dispuesto de datos razonables para empezar a trabajar.  Sobre si el Universo es finito, podemos decir ya que tiene pinta de que no. El descubrimiento de la llamada radiacin de fondo nos dio la posibilidad de poner fecha y lmites al Universo y ver sus orgenes como en una fotografa.  El a?o pasado, entre otras especulaciones, la revista Astronomy & Astrophysics public en su tirada de septiembre los resultados de Luminet y su equipo, que defienden que el Universo tiene forma de dodecaedro.  Veamos un poco cmo han llegado a esa conclusin. Pensemos en primer lugar en una campana. Cuando se golpea y recibimos su caracterstico sonido, ste nos llega en ondas de varias longitudes. Pero una campana nunca podr emitir sonido en una longitud de onda mayor que la campana misma. Cuanto mayor sea la campana, mayor ser la longitud de onda en la que puede emitir y por tanto ms grave ser su sonido. Por esta misma regla, un contrabajo puede emitir sonidos ms graves que un violn. El principio general que estamos tratando es que de una cosa peque?a nunca puede salir una ms grande; ms intuitivo imposible.Con nuestro Universo sucede algo parecido. Recibimos de las zonas ms alejadas del mismo ondas electromagnticas de muchos tama?os, pero siempre hay un lmite superior al tama?o de la longitud de onda que podemos recibir. Igual que de la campana no salen ondas ms grandes que la campana misma, en el Universo no se generan propagaciones mayores que el mismo Universo.  Nuestros telescopios apuntan a los confines del Universo y encuentran diferentes distancias desde la Tierra dndonos la forma aproximada del mencionado objeto de 12 caras. A partir de este punto la cosa se complica, porque no poda ser suficiente para un Universo tan rico en complejidad el tener una forma tan simplona como la de un dodecaedro. Adems se especula con que las 12 caras que forman este dodecaedro sean adems puertas de salida y reentrada nuestro Universo. De nuevo, la imagen muestra esquemticamente lo que quiero decir. As, para un viajero intergalctico puede parecer el Universo es infinito cuando en realidad no hace ms que salir por una cara y entrar por la cara opuesta. Claro que tambin acabar dndose cuenta cuando vea las mismas cosas una y otra vez. Otro ejemplo de lo mismo es que si mirramos con la suficiente profundidad a los confines del Universo, deberamos acabar viendo nuestro propio cogote.La vuelta de tuerca final a todo esto es ya para los que gusten de la geometra de muchas dimensiones. Empecemos por un crculo... pensemos ahora en cul sera la versin tridimensional de un crculo: en efecto, una esfera. En esta misma lnea podemos decir que existen esferas de cuatro o ms dimensiones que son versiones multidimensionales de la esfera tridimensional que todos conocemos. A estas esferas de ms de tres dimensiones se las conoce como hiperesferas. Ahora imaginemos un baln de ftbol. La costura del baln est formada por pentgonos y hexgonos que se doblan un poco para ajustarse a las forma esfrica del baln. Con 12 pentgonos curvados es suficiente para cubrir completamente un baln de ftbol.  Volvemos ahora a nuestro Universo. Se especula con que tambin tiene ms de tres dimensiones. Y adems, con que la hiperforma que tiene puede cubrirse con 120 hiperdodecaedros con una peculiaridad: de los 120, 119 no son ms que un reflejo del que falta. ?Se lo pueden imaginar? Pues ni ustedes, ni yo, ni nadie por mucha geometra que sepa. Otra cosa es que s se puede comprobar sobre el papel, aunque nadie sea capaz de imaginarlo en realidad.

AA10758548	The principle behind moving coil loudspeakers, as conventional designs are known, is almost as old as recorded sound, yet despite many attempts has never been bettered. Electrostatic and ribbon panel driver systems are the most successful alternatives but they are expensive and do not better cones in all respects. The NXT panel is an interesting alternative that offers remarkable dispersion at a low price, but doesn't compete on sound quality grounds.    Moving coil drive units have a limited bandwidth, their size defining the range of frequencies they can reproduce. The smaller a drive unit the higher the frequencies - a tweeter or high frequency driver produces treble from 2.5kHz to 20kHz or more, whereas a mid/bass driver has a range of 25Hz to 2.5kHz. Therefore most speakers combine two or more drive units in an attempt to reproduce the audio band. As each drive unit has a limited range the signal has to be split up by a crossover, a passive electrical network that sits between speaker terminals and drive units and splits the signal according to the drivers' capabilities.    Drive units and crossovers are housed in a cabinet, these usually have a reflex port to increase bass output and improve efficiency. Variations exist in active and digital loudspeakers, the former incorporate amplification and electronic crossovers while the latter add digital to analogue conversion stage so that the signal remains in the digital domain until the last moment. The closest thing there is to a truly digital loudspeaker is the 1 Ltd Digital Sound Projector. Cabinet materials affect the end result as much as the drivers themselves and designers use carbon fibre, aluminium, plastics and wood to control resonance.    Even though most loudspeakers operate on the same principles there are myriad ways of skinning this particular cat, so few sound the same. Even getting designers to agree on the most desirable parameters of drive units is difficult, so it's no surprise that so many variations exist, nonetheless each is a balance of compromises. Fortunately however, the majority are pretty good and some are fantastic.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	a loudspeaker has a permanent magnet with a coil wrapped loosely round it and attached to a cone to radiate sound    when an alternating current flows in the coil it pull the cone in and out from the permanent magnet, and the cone pushes out sound waves

The value of a variable can be stated directly by an equality of the form:    variable = number    So, try to make those into that form.  This is accomplished using the rules of algebra, the important ones here are that:    You can add, subtract, multiply and divide both sides of an equality by the same value and the equality is still valid.  You can "collect terms" and simplify as shown in class (different teachers teach these in different ways, but they are the same).    So, for both what must be done to make them into x = ? and y = ?    Well, taking the first one:    8x+40 = 6x  8x+40 - 6x = 6x - 6x //taking 6x off both sides  8x-6x+40 = 6x - 6x // rearranging terms to highlight a simplification step  2x + 40 = 0 //collecting terms or simplifying.  2x +40 - 40 = 0 -40 //subtract 40 from both sides  2x + 0 = -40 //collecting terms or simplifying.  2x = -40 //collecting terms or simplifying.  x = -20 //divide both sides by 2; now in the form that we wanted.    The second is solved for y in pretty much the same way.|`|9vFHobQ5aa	Jacob, Jacob.....these are really easy. I hope you're just starting to learn algebra. One thing to always keep in mind, Jake, is that these are "equations". That means that one side of the equation equals the other side. So if I add 10 to one side, I've got to add 10 to the other side to keep it equal. Okay, suppose we subtract 6x from each side of the first one. then what you've got is: 2x + 40 = 0. Now subtract 40 from both sides; you get  2x = - 40. Well if 2x equals minus 40 then I guess one x equals minus 20....and that's your answer. But to do it without using your head, divide both sides by two. Can you see that that gives you x = - 20?                   The second one's just the same, Jake. Subtract 3y from both sides,and you get  - 10 = 4y. Divide both sides by 4 and you get    - 10 / 4 = y.  That's  ten forths of five halves or two and a half, so   y = - 2,5.

Sow them where they'll receive partial shade at the hottest time of the day. Planting near climbing beans, peas or corn is ideal. Encourage fast growth by giving them plenty of water.

It is certainly not falling in any meaningful sense of the word - that is in the sense that its distance from the gravitating body of the Sun is decreasing - and it is highly misleading to describe orbits in this way.    However, it is accelerating, because its circular (well, strictly elliptical) path around the Sun means it is constantle changing direction and hence changing velocity (though its speed - the magnitude of its velocity, not direction - is the same).|`|426876aa8277d26015a96047f004b972aa	THE ENTIRE UNIVEARSE IS ENTIRELY INSIDE AN ENOURMUS *** BUBBLE THAT SICK AND TWISTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE SLOWLY LICKING AWAY AT FOR MORE DETAILS GO TO GEORGE BUSH.COM|`|AA11734411	GOD|`|AA10611551	There is no gravity in space pulling the Earth downward, so Earth cannot "fall".

However the idea is using the law (P1 / T1 = P2 / T2) to calculate the pressure the tank can stand before bursting, so we'll have the respective temperature. If outside temperature (in the outer pipeline which gas is going out) is increasing, the pressure is increasing too, thus it forces the valve to close (like you push it).|`|AA12277638	A gas cylinder containing explosive hydrogen gas has a pressure of 50 atm (P1) at a temperature of 300 K (T1).

X0e6p9Ilaa	SiCl4 + H20 --> SiO2 + 4HCl ???    This is not what it may appear.  This reaction doesn't occur in liquid water.  This is an example of why it is so important to include state symbols.  The reaction occurs at 900 to 1000 degrees C or more and can be catalyzed by ammonia gas.  This process is called chemical vapor deposition.  Adding the state symbols will make more sense:    SiCl4(g) + 2H20(g) --> SiO2(s) + 4HCl(g)    The degree to which the neutralization of phosphoric acid occurs will depend upon the relative concentrations of the acid and base.  It would be nice if the problem used the word "excess" with one reactant or the other.  Also keep in mind that mercury (II) hydroxide is insoluble in water and requires a (s) state symbol. Phosphoric acid is a weak acid, and not completely dissociated.  There are many possibilities for products here.  If you have an excess of the base then the acid will be completely neutralized.    4Hg(OH)2(s) + 2H3PO4(aq) -->  Hg3(PO4)2(s) + 6HOH(l)    HClO4 is a strong acid.  P4O10 is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid.  This reaction is not one that is done in aqueous solution, but instead may be done at a slightly elevated temperature, or at or near room temperature.  This is not a redox reaction, so you don't have to worry about changes in oxidation state.    12HClO4(l) + P4O10(s) -->  4H3PO4(l) +  6Cl2O7(l)

If you did, it would be something you'd have noticed long before now. Someone can't leave you a gift like this just by dying. It's more genetic in nature, meaning it's passed down that way, not something willed onto someone else. I grew up able to sense things other people couldn't.     Sensing spirits is also more than inside your mind. You'd feel it outside of yourself as well. Some examples (and I use myself, b/c I can only speak for myself).... I can feel them around me, the same way I could feel your presence were you in the same room with me (but my eyes were closed). When they touch me, I feel it on my skin, same way I'd feel your touch were you to touch me. I hear them with my ears as well as inside my mind. I have friends who can actually see them, the way they were when they lived, every detail.

The fact of the matter is, things can exist without people always having to prove it.    Just please try to keep an open mind and know that just we have not yet proved something exist yet does not mean it does not exist.      "The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"    anyone who tells you otherwise, is a closed minded individual who would rather just put the idea down than simply states he does not know.    .....

AA12272885	Sunlight isn't really the primary reason bananas ripen, the bananas produce ethylene, which is the natural ripening agent of the fruit. Ethylene is the chemical compound with the formula C2H4.      Just as changes are taking place inside while bananas ripen, shifts in the composition of the peel are occurring. As the banana develops, the peel acts as a housing for chlorophyll that is manufactured as a result of the direct sunlight required to grow the fruit. As the interior fruit reaches peak condition, the green peel that had been absorbing all that sunlight begins to undergo a chemical change that helps to mellow the fruit. As a result, the interior of the peel releases nutrients into the fruit that enhance the sweetness.     At the same time, the peel begins to lose chlorophyll content and changes from green to yellow. During this transformation, the peel itself begins to deteriorate, leaving behind only a thin covering that can be peeled away from the mature fruit with ease. Since bananas ripen quickly, it does not take long to go from a bitter green banana to a sweet yellow banana.

d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Relativityis the only way we currently have of trying to extend our ideas beyind the local to the rest of the universe.    This is because the intuitive assumptions that we can simply extend our frame of reference here on earth to fill the rest of the universe (like extending the lines on a map off the page into infinity) is simply wrong.    The fact that the speed of light is the same everywhere in the universe, regardless of how you are moving, means that there is a difference between the reference frames of observers moving relative to one another. You can fill the universe with the reference frame of either observer, but they are different and neither is preferred. This is special relativity.    The fact that gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration, and that the force of gravity is in opposite directions on either side of the centre of mass of a gravitating mass means that you cannot construct a single reference frame that fills all of the universe in a simple way. This is general relativity.
AA12223903	Helium is less dense than the air we normally breathe (Air is made up of approx 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen)  :  When we talk air passes out from our lungs through our vocal chords and is caused to vibrate and you hear the words. When you mix helium with air the resulting mix is less dense so as you breathe out the timbre of your voice is altered. The spped of sound in a less dense helium/air mix is higher than in just air. You are increasing the speed of sound of your voice when breathing out this less dense mixture and this increase in speed will affect the frequencies that make up your 'voice'.  If the frequencies are affected the timbre is affected too. A more dense gas may have a very wierd affect.  Strictly speaking although most people say it is the pitch that changes, it is the actually the 'timbre' which is changed, as your vocal chords produce the same shapes and therefore the same pitch.|`|AA11665732	This question was asked and resolved earlier:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1...|`|AA10975309	it replaces the air in your lungs so the gas which the vocal cord operate in is thinner and thus the sound is a higher frequency than usual when the high pitched vibrations hit the air to go to the ears. this air vibrates easier than thick air so your usual vocal action that you are trained to do, reacts differently to this changed atmosphere. the same thing would happen on the moon.

The two images are then replayed onto a screen using one of two approaches.    In the first, the images are projected alternately onto the screen, and special glasses black out one eye or the other so each eye only see the image that is meant for it.    In the second, the images are projected through polarising filters placed at 90 degrees to one another (the filters slant at _/- 45 degrees relative to your eyes - think about why this is). In this case the glasses you wear are simply crossed polarising filters, so that the right filter blocks images meant for the left eye and vice versa.    The polarising filters approach suffers from unpleasant artefactgs if the viewer moves his or her head out of the horizontal, but the glasses are cheaper and lighter.

Yes, the barge displaces water, and the weight of that displaced water does provide the buoyant force to the barge, which is Archimedes principle.      The very fact the water is supplying an upward buoyant force contributes to the extra load because of Newton's Third Law.  The water pushes up on the barge, the barge pushes back on the water with the same force.  So, the displaced water does not take away the weight of the barge.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	No, the barge does not add to the load.    The reason is that the water displaced by the barge - which must equal its weight - flows off the aquaduct and into the rest of the canal. So there is less water on the aquaduct, but the additional weight of a barge.    If the aquaduct were sealed at both ends (a fiarly pointless arrangement) then answer 2 would be correct because the displaced water could not escape.

59dc06dedd02db073204b8fe5c3ac69caa	It's to do with signal / wavelength strength. The more energy a signal has - the further it can travel. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths which loose their energy quicker than higher, shorter wavelength frequencies meaning they have a shorter range.    The directional ability is due to the same principal, as a signal looses strength it dissipates and looses direction.|`|AA10471747	the lower the frequency the the larger the wave length...     sound is made via wave passing through the air... if the waves are bigger they are going to disturb more air... thus they will have the tendency to spread out.      sound travels at 340 m/s (approx)  if the frequency is, say, 1000 hz then the wave length is about 30 cm or 1 foot.  So if it is a free area it will try to take up the space of atleast a cubic foot.  that is a lot of air vibrating around, so the energy will disipate out quickly.      On the other hand if it is 10,000 hz then it is only a couple of centimeters or about an inch^3 space that it will take up so the energy is very focused and can be directed more easily.     Think about it this way.  all sound has the tendency to double its area of influence.  So for every (just a estiment) 1/10 of a second it double the ammount of space that it is in.      So in one sec it will double 10 times... 1unit then 2 then 4 then 8 then ... up to about 500 at one sec    So the sound wave that is 1000 hz is now 500 cubic feet, but the 10,000 hz wave is only 500 cubic inches     so the long wave spreads out very quickly    (the numbers i used are just examples the actual action of sound waves is much more complex, but i think this a decent description)|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	They aren't.    The issue is that a detector (your ears, say) are limited in their ability to resolve the direction a sound is coming from, and that resolution gets worse the longer the wavelength of the sound.     To improve it you have to increase the size of the detector.

AA12121778	alpha-Crystallin is a major lens protein, comprising up to 40% of total lens proteins, where its structural function is to assist in maintaining the proper refractive index in the lens. In addition to its structural role, it has been shown to function in a chaperone-like manner. The chaperone-like function of alpha-crystallin will help prevent the formation of large light-scattering aggregates and possibly cataract. In the lens, alpha-crystallin is a polydisperse molecule consisting of a 3:1 ratio of alpha A to alpha B subunits. In this study, we expressed recombinant alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin in E. coli and compared the polydispersity, structure and aggregation state between each other and native bovine lens alpha-crystallin. Using gel permeation chromatography to assay for polydispersity, we found native alpha-crystallin to be significantly more polydisperse than either recombinant alpha A- or alpha B-crystallin, with alpha B-crystallin having the most homogeneous structure of the three. Reconstructed images of alpha B-crystallin obtained with cryo-electron microscopy support the concept that alpha B-crystallin is an extremely dynamic molecule and demonstrated that it has a hollow interior. Interestingly, we present evidence that native alpha-crystallin is significantly more thermally stable than either alpha A- or alpha B-crystallin alone. In fact, our experiments suggest that a 3:1 ratio of alpha A to alpha B subunit composition in an alpha-crystallin molecule is optimal in terms of thermal stability. This fascinating result explains the stoichiometric ratios of alpha A- and alpha B-crystallin subunits in the mammalian lens.
AA11293537	Concerted reactions  happen all at one, they have no intermediates.  Non-concerted reaction take more than one step and therefore have intermediates|`|1a129d8e3d3034d29ee91d3a86e5c101aa	In a concerted reaction, the reaction occurs in a single step. In non-concerted reactions, a reactive intermediate (ex: carbonium ion) is required for the reaction to be completed. Sn2 and E2 reactions are concerted while Sn1 and E1 reactions are non-concerted.      Here maybe this will help some.    SN1 and E1 Reactions   SN2 and E2 vs. SN1 and E1   The SN2 and E2 mechanisms require a good nucleophile or a strong base. In contrast, SN1 and E1 mechanisms need weak nucleophiles and bases.   The nucleophiles and bases in SN1 and E1 reactions aren't strong enough to eject the leaving group by themselves. Instead, both SN1 and E1 reactions are characterized by the formation of a common carbocation intermediate. Even weak bases and poor nucleophiles will react with the carbocation.   Consequences of the Carbocation Intermediate   The carbocation intermediate lends a number of unique features to SN1 and E1 reactions. First, both mechanisms require a stable carbocation intermediate. Thus SN1 and E1 will only work for secondary or tertiary -carbons**. Second, SN1 and E1 reactions involve a carbocation intermediate and are not concerted. Because of the geometry of the carbocation and their non- concerted nature, both reactions result in a loss of stereochemical configuration. Third, SN1 and E1 reactions are favored by polar, protic solvents. Polar, protic solvents stabilize the carbocation. Fourth, secondary carbocations may rearrange to form tertiary carbocations. This greatly increases the number of products.|`|258cb6363146c2d597b3b9db27d68f96aa	Concerted reactions occur in a single step, and thus do not require the production of  the intermediate carbocation.

You cannot use it for nuclear power if it ordinary hydrogen, but if it is deuterium (hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its nucleus) you can in theory fuse it to form helium - though this has not been achieved in a practical way yet (the Sun does it pretty well though).|`|AA11252393	Well, it must be nuclear fusion; 2 hydrogen nuclei forming 1 helium nucleus, with a little of the mass turning into energy.    When you burn hydrogen in air to make water, or consume it in a fuel cell, the hydrogen atoms are still there; they have not been converted into energy; the energy just changed its type, a bit; potential chemical energy --> heat, for example.|`|c1ec8bff1cf12f1a4eea3eb1ff436554aa	One way: Hydrogen is converted into energy in the sun by the process of nuclear fusion. Four Hydrogen nuclei combine to form one helium nucleus. The mass of helium nucleus is less than that of four hydrogen nuclei. This mass is converted into a large amount of energy and is given out in the form of heat and light. As a large amount of helium nuclei are continuously being formed, a very large amount of heat is given out by the sun. This process occurs in immense pressure and in a temperature of (2X10^7) degree Celsius. If we can do that on earth, we should get energy according to the calculations.    The other way is to burn it.

AA11301249	Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear "design" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.  Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This   "intelligent design" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.      (THE SCIENTIFIC COLLAPSE OF DARWINISM)    Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions.   Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:  1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth.   2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all.   3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.    The power evolutionists impute to the three force they believe to have produced lifetime, mud, and chanceis actually enough to elevate them into a trinity. They believe that the combination of these random forces gave shape to the human brain, intelligence, cognitive ability, judgment and memory.  In this section, I will examine these three basic points in general outlines:      The First Insurmountable Step:   (The Origin of Life)    The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell" originate?  Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology.     "LIFE COMES FROM LIFE"    On the other hand, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while.   Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.   Even when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science.   However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."30  For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.       The French biologist Louis Pasteur  The Russian|`|bbd5b84d59253c68f849198f3be5afdcaa	it is 50% true..because only 50% of the DNA we have will exist in our child . the other 50% comes form the other parent so we only get 1/2 of immortalilty and with each generation that percent is getting lower...so we actualy get only ONE life and it doesn't matter how many children we have..but what we do for the others will make us immortal|`|e70aa2c04deacb17ffcd65444b2b18e0aa	It's more like that we are immortal in a chemical fashion.   From a biological viewpoint, after a few generations only a very small part of your DNA is still remaining in your distant offspring.   From a chemical viewpoint, after dying and decomposing, your body is turned into matter and, on an even tinier scale, to atoms. As atoms are freely converted into other bodies, and as a human body consists of billions and billions of atoms (DNA for example, is a large protein and when you zoom in on proteins, at ground level these are also atoms), there's definitely the chance you have some atoms in your body that were part of a dinosaur...|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Yes, but if we keep screwing with birth control, and genetics, we might not live too much longer!|`|065c4ccb1266446bb12d60c809e0641daa	your exact DNA fades as generations go on    what about mutation???|`|370ef32f804c3ae7b6a9bfd3328ebddeaa	I agree, which has made me make the statement that people who choose not to have children are committing genetic suicide.|`|f1c31d76f4021feed6254d19a5e811e9aa	Technically, you can be put in suspended animation and live forever if revived with sufficient technology to keep you alive and well.

Vf2lnEH7aa	1. Air cools as it rises because of the environmental lapse rate in the atmosphere. Typically, cooler air is found aloft. If the air at the surface is the warmest, then the air parcel will cool as it rises.<br>  <br>  2. Precipitation forms when air parcels are raised past the lifting condensation level. Once the air is saturated, no more condensation can naturally occur. The water droplets in the air are forced to form larger droplets. With the help of cloud condensation nuclei, the droplets grow until they're too massive to be held in the clouds by upward forces. Gravity brings the precipitation to the Earth's surface.<br>  <br>  3. One reason is the presence of orographic features. Since air cannot move through a mountain, it is forced to ascend. A second reason is surface heating, primarily by sunlight. If air at the surface is heated enough to be warmer than the air aloft, it will rise. Warm air is less dense than cold air, which makes it buoyant. A third reason is a low pressure system. At the center, there is a lifting mechanism. Air converges at the surface, and then rises.<br>  <br>  4. Cloud condensation nuclei enter the air either by natural processes or human activities. One example is volcanoes putting a lot of dust, ash, etc. into the air. A second example is industrial emissions entering the air by some sort of lifting mechanism, such as a low pressure system.<br>  <br>  5. Rain fall is measured using a rain gauge or some other type of precipitation measurement device.<br>  <br>  6. Drizzle is made up of very small water droplets.

In meteorology, precipitation (also known as one of the classes of hydrometeors, which are atmospheric water phenomena) is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that is deposited on the earth's surface.[1] It occurs when the atmosphere, a large gaseous solution, becomes saturated with water vapour and the water condenses and falls out of solution (i.e., precipitates)<br>  <br>  3.ere are several mechanisms that cause dynamic rising motion. Warm air advection in the low levels of the troposphere causes rising air. This is because warm air expands, creating a higher thickness, which in turn causes the air to rise. Positive Vorticity Advection causes the air to rise. The three terms that make up positive vorticity  in the Northern Hemisphere include counterclockwise curvature, counterclockwise shear on a horizontal plane, and earth's counterclockwise Coriolis. Divergence and rising air occur in the right rear and left front quadrants of a jet streak. Any low level density boundary will lead to rising motion if convergence occurs along that low-level boundary. Low level boundaries include fronts, outflow boundaries, moisture gradients, and sea breeze fronts. Upslope flow forces the air to rise. Isentropic lifting, by way of warm air advection over a frontal boundary or a cold shallow dome of air, will cause the air to rise. Convergence in the low levels will cause the air to rise. The best examples are convergence along frontal boundaries and frictional convergence into low pressure.<br>  <br>  4. Cloud condensation nuclei or CCNs (also known as cloud seeds) are small particles (typically 0.0002 mm, or 1/100 th the size of a cloud droplet [1]) about which cloud droplets coalesce. Water requires a non-gaseous surface to make the transition from a vapour to a liquid. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled below 0 °C (32 °F) before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles). In above freezing temperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400% before the droplets could form. The concept of cloud condensation nuclei has led to the idea of cloud seeding, that tries to encourage rainfall by seeding the air with condensation nuclei.<br>  <br>  5.Rain gauge and cubic inches<br>  <br>  6.Drizzle is light precipitation that is made up of liquid water drops that are smaller than rain drops.

There is no reason to believe that you can travel through space faster than light.    Some observations suggest that some bodies are actually moving faster than light.... the trick is that as space expands so does the distance between some bodies.  That means that the expansion of space is working in conjunction with motion.    So if you can arbitrarily bend space to put two points close together, you would travel below the speed of light between them, but to an observer it could appear that you exceeded the speed of light.  (The observer's view of space/time > c).|`|AA11675704	v have derived the speed of light. so far v have come  across objects with lesser speed. there could be objects at far off distance which are travelling at higher speed of light which v may have to encounter in the days to come.

Below are some excerpts from Wikipedia that will explain things much better than I can.    Second Law of Thermodynamics:    The entropy of an isolated system not at equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value.    Self-organization vs. entropy:    The idea of self-organization challenges an earlier paradigm of ever-decreasing order which was based on a philosophical generalization from the second law of thermodynamics in statistical thermodynamics where entropy is envisioned as a measure of the statistical "disorder" at a microstate level. However, at the microscopic or local level, the two need not be in contradiction: it is possible for a system to reduce its entropy by transferring it to its environment.    In open systems, it is the flow of matter and energy through the system that allows the system to self-organize, and to exchange entropy with the environment. This is the basis of the theory of dissipative structures. Ilya Prigogine noted that self-organization can only occur far away from thermodynamic equilibrium.    It would appear that, since isolated systems cannot decrease their entropy, only open systems can exhibit self-organization. However, such a system can gain macroscopic order while increasing its overall entropy. Specifically, a few of the system's macroscopic degrees of freedom can become more ordered at the expense of microscopic disorder.    In many cases of biological self-assembly, for instance metabolism, the increasing organization of large molecules is more than compensated for by the increasing entropy of small molecules, especially water. At the level of a whole organism and over longer time scales, though, biological systems are open systems feeding from the environment and dumping waste into it.|`|551ef99691276b14677abc5110ab92cdaa	life is all about bringing order out of chaos. that's what we do, it's our jobs. a bigger question to ponder is when/where will/does this enthalpy stop occuring? does it ever stop? what will our universe look like when/if it does?

dc4da4c799521390e9a3c0efa27e213eaa	Aunque es difcil descifrar sus verdaderas races, se dice que la primera mujer  pez conocida se llamaba: Atargatis, la diosa de la luna, protectora de la fecundidad y del amor. Segn la leyenda Atargatis, perseguida por Mopsos, se sumergi en el lago Ascaln con su hijo, y se salv gracias a su cola de pez.    Lo cierto es que las sirenas son personajes mitolgicos cuyo canto guiaban a los marinos, en sus aventuras por el mar, de hecho su apariencia fsica fue evolucionando, en la poca griega eran representados como aquellos seres con la cara humana y cuerpo de ave, su transformacin en criaturas mitad mujer, mitad pez, con la parte inferior recubierta de escamas, se remonta al parecer a la Edad Media y a los mitos griegos.    OTRO MAS:    EL ORIGEN DE LAS SIRENAS    Difcil es dilucidar el verdadero origen de las sirenas. Dejando a un lado a las antiguas sirenas con forma de mujeres-ave, se dice que la primera mujer-pez conocida fue Atargatis, la diosa de la luna, protectora de la fecundidad y el amor. Atargatis, perseguida por Mopsos, se sumergi en el lago Ascaln con su hijo, y se salv gracias a su cola de pez. Esta leyenda se confunde con la de la diosa siria Derceto, que tambin se arroj a las aguas del mismo lago, despus de matar a uno de sus sacerdotes y abandonar a la hija de ambos en el desierto. Derceto recibi la cola de pez como smbolo de su pecado, y su hija, criada por las palomas, se convirti en Semramis, reina de Babilonia.     Tambin puede encontrarse una semejanza con las sirenas en la diosa Afrodita, hija del semen de Zeus convertido en espuma de mar, que fue diosa del amor y protectora de los marinos. Su espejo ha sido heredado por toda la estirpe de sirenas.    Para buena parte de los sabios griegos, sin embargo, las sirenas tienen por padre a Aqueloo, un ro personificado en figura de hombre con cola de pez. En cuanto a la madre, la confusin crece: puede ser la diosa de la memoria, o alguna de sus hijas, las musas. Quiz las sirenas sean hijas de la Elocuencia, de la Danza, de laTragedia o de la Msica. Hasta podran ser hijas de Ceto, la ballena.         OCEANIDAS Y NEREIDAS    El dios Ocano y su hermana Tetis tuvieron trescientas hijas, las Ocenidas, que luego se extendieron por todos los mares y los abismos marinos. Una de ellas, Dride, fu madre de otras cincuenta ninfas de agua, las Nereidas, llamadas as en honor a su padre Nereo, de la raza de los Viejos del Mar, creada tambin por Ocano y Tetis.    Las Nereidas habitan en el Mar Mediterrneo, y cada una de ellas representa una de las formas de este mar. Por ejemplo, Tala es la sirena verde, y Glaucea, la azul. Dinamenea simboliza el vaivn de las olas, y Cimodar, la calma. Una de las Nereidas, Anfitrite, fue amante de Poseidn y madre de los Tritones. Las Nereidas protegan a los barcos, y no cantaban para atraer a los marinos, sino para complacer a su padre. Los antiguos describieron a las Nereidas con el cuerpo cubierto de escamas y formas de pez. A partir de aqu, el mito de la Sirena fue creciendo por todo el mundo como las ondas en la superficie calma del agua...         SIRENAS HISTRICAS    Hasta en los mapas del Renacimiento poda leerse la frase Hic sunt sirenae(Aqu estn las sirenas) escrita en medio de las reas destinadas a los ocanos. El hombre que surc el Atlntico, Cristbal Coln, tambin asegura que l y sus hombres las vieron, aunque no tan bellas como cuentan las historias. Muchas crnicas de reyes refieren la existencia de sirenas capturadas, y an cercanos nuestros das navegantes y exploradores relatan encuentros con mujeres marinas, como una que apareci en la Antrtida en 1823 u otra en las Bahamas en 1869. La primera tena los cabellos verdes, la segunda, azules. Sin ir ms lejos, en Lirganes, municipio espa?ol, existi un hombre-pez, y circulan rumores de otro ser de estas caractersticas en el ro Ebro.         SIRENAS, CANCIONES Y LEYENDAS    "Encantan a los mortales que se les acercan. ?Pero es bien loco el que se detiene para escuchar sus cantos! Nunca volver a ver a su mujer ni a sus hijos, pues con sus voces de lirio las sirenas lo encantan, mientras que la ribera vecina est llena de osamentas blanqueadas y de restos humanos de carnes corrompidas..." Este texto escrito hace 2.800 a?os es probablemente el origen de la ms antigua y conocida de las leyendas: las sirenas que atraen a los marinos con sus voces mgicas, y hacen encallar los barcos y ahogarse los tripulantes.

AA10796854	The three types of molecules the body can use for energy production/storage are fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.    The amount of energy in kilocalories (Calories) of each molecule type per gram of material is approximately:    Fat: 9 Calories per gram  Carbohydrate: 4 calories per gram  Protein: 4 calories per gram  (see website)    Based on this information, fat appears to be the most compact form of energy storage, and thus the best option for a migratory bird.    I think that the reason for the differing energy concentration is the molecular structure.  Fat has very few oxygens relative to carbon and hydrogen, when compared to proteins and fats.  Oxygen bonded to carbon or hydrogen in a hydrocarbon molecular structure reduces the number of outside oxygens needed for combustion of the hydrocarbon, reducing the total amount of oxidation taking place and hence reducing the amount of energy that can be gotten from a reaction.    I think you can see this from heat of combustion data for the various compounds (undergraduate chemistry).|`|6b393313362ae67316b6f08fd0221335aa	http://kilby.sac.on.ca/faculty/dgalajda/...

d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	I think you have misunderstood what the paradox actually is.    There is no problem with the fact that we measure time running slower in a frame that is moving with respect to us. We can see this easily in any number of experiments.    The paradox is that as stated the problem seems symmetric because it describes two frames of reference moving with respect to each other, with no reason to choose one over the other, so it is not obvious which twin should age less.    But the wording of the problem belies the truth.     There are, in fact, three frames. There is the rest frame of the twin at home. There is the frame of the twin travelling away from Earth. And there is the frame of the twin returning to Earth.     The travelling twin spends time in two of these frames, and so the experiment was never symmetric. There is no need to account for acceleration to explain the result (though there would of course be lots to come home). You can do it all with a space time diagram looking at the times these three events occur in the THREE (not TWO) frames:    1. twin leaves  2. twin turns  3. twin gets home|`|AA10377727	Symmetry is not the only thing responsible.|`|a7a7d61d2304fa70769870fad1171da0aa	Time is a velocity "c".  Mass is composed of physical time.  The one moving has an increase of energy in direction of movement.  This is realized as hf = mk (kinetic energy).  As the energy in direction of movement increases, energy at right angles decrease proportionately.    The reason for the above is that, at rest a mass has the potential of energy moving any direction at the same speed.  When a mass moves at the speed of light, minus 2 mps, energy has the potential of movement at right angles to direction of travel of 2 mps.  At the speed of light, there would be no movement possible in any direction, for all energy would be in one direction only.    Being frozen in time due to linear movement means that all forms of energy transfer becomes less and less.  When this happens all systems, electrical, bio, etc. move toward zero.  The moving twin ceases to age, because he begins existing more and more in only a single dimension, and ceases to exist according to the three dimensions of time that his twin lives in.

What makes it strange is the conservation of strangeness principle (much like the conservation of mass and energy, electric charge, bottomness, topness, etc.) which was discovered before the quark model was put forth.      What researchers discovered was that certain particles always came together.  One noticeable set was the kaon and hyperon.  The humorless ones, noticing this "strange" behavior, assumed correctly that there must be a conservation law coming into play.  They guessed that there was a certain particle/anti-particle pair between the two (kaon and hyperon).  They then dubbed this conservation of strangeness.      When the quark model was introduced, they decided to give the strange quark a strangeness of -1 and the anti-strange a strangeness of 1 (there is a reason, though it's not really important at the moment) just to keep things consistent...and confusing.|`|AA10422995	Strange is just a name not a function of its properties per se.|`|44645d9b16052d930827c1164b3d1d32aa	Physicists tend to have an odd sense of humor to begin with.

They may not catch it, may detonate off target, would produce an unpredictable affect on momentum if they detonated other than directly between the asteroid and us, probably would not produce a large enough impact on its momentum and if they broke it up could just magnify the problem.    The best approach I have see suggested is to flood its path with dust. This could be delivered accurately and could move the trajectory of the asteroid by the small amounts required to make it miss in a far more controlled way. Its effect would also be more pronounced on the trajectory according to calculations.    But if it has our name on it, we are doomed.

But those who believe in this theory also give explanations to explain this stuff an overcome this hurdle.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	String theory is a theory of the fundamental particles and forces in physics.     The accepted theory at present is called the standard model. It explains very accurately how all of the matter we see every day is made up and beahves, and it unifies as a single force three of the four forces that we know act in the universe. It is the most accurate theory ever developed. The standard model actually models all fundamental particles in the universe as points in space with no size.    But it is not complete.It leaves out gravity.    Gravity is an astonishingly weak force compared to the other three, so it is only an important omission in two places really: the beginning of the unvierse and in a black hole.     String theory attempts to include gravity by modelling particles as 1 dimensional strings instead of points. Unfortunately this leads to some very unphysical characteristics in the mathematics - such as the emergence of extra dimensions that are not actually observed. This lack of correspondence with reality has not deterred theorists, who try to give reasons why most of their dimensions are not observed.    While string theory makes a sort of progress every day, not a single prediction it makes has been tested successfully to date. As a result many string theorists have lost interest in experimental results and pay scant regard to them. This makes string theory more of a philosophy than a science, because it is detached from observed reality. A single, simple observation could prove the whole thing a joke.    Unfortunately string theory has caught people's imagination and has led to all sort of idiotic claims in the media (and of course her) about what it says and what it means.|`|ebb7a67546c50e181c8b3d2196935bdfaa	Like many physics ideas, it grew out of an observation.  Many of the equations which occur in vibrations are also seen in quantum mechanics and astrophysics.  When Schroedinger was looking at Dirac's and Heisenberg's formulations, he thought, ha!  that's cool.  However, quantum mechanics at that time continued to think in terms of particles.    Relativistic theories explained the conversion between matter and energy and behaviors near light speed.  However, subatomic behavior with quarks required rethinking what was happening.    As researchers began studying quarks, the old vibrating-string equations--known from violin studies by classical physicists like Chaldini--once again appeared.  Michio Kaku and others threw out the idea, maybe what we need to do is rethink how we conceive matter.  You don't have packets flipping between matter and energy, but that these states are just modes in which a 'string' shifts by its natural resonance.    String frequency is determine by tension, mass, and other properties at the macroscopic level, i.e., for violins.  It did seem to help explain anomalies by avoiding mathematical solutions that would violate reality (like dividing by zero).  It does, however, not fully answer all the problems.    Undaunted, string theory was upgraded to superstring theory which tied in relativity and electrodynamics to become more encompassing.  However, it still falls short of being a UFT or universal field theory.    Like supergravity and superman, there is always some kryptonite lying around.  Translating from subatomic to cosmic has been easier than moving it to the reality in between.  Such is the caveat from taking mathematical models as being reality instead of just modeling reality.  Those topologists who treat 'strings' more literally look at how they twist about, get knotted, and the implications of these knots might have.    It does prove useful in thinking how there is a "harmonic nature" to both cosmic and subatomic phenomena that parallels our everyday reality.  Translating strings into 12 dimensional spaces poses the idea that what we perceive is just a small fraction of what reality may really be like.  However, that is not proven.  What started as an observation, became a model, then a theory.  Like all the previous physicists, the nature of uncertainty tempered with predictability builds a certain 'philosophical air'.  But strings are basically ways of understanding the 'fibers' (or fibres if you prefer) that weave together the universe.

Therefore, for a water solution... any ionic compound will be an electrolyte.  This is a little simplistic, but in 8 years of collegiate chemistry, I have only seen one exception... not bad for a rule of thumb.|`|AA12121778	Electrolytes commonly exist as acids, bases or salts. Furthermore, some gases may act as electrolytes under conditions of high temperature or low pressure. An electrolyte may be described as concentrated if it has a high concentration of ions; or dilute, a low concentration of ions. If a high proportion of the dissolved solute dissociates to form free ions, the solution is strong; if most of the dissolved solute does not dissociate, the solution is weak. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited via electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.

PBFtPdmbaa	For static indeterminate truss, I usually use unit load method from Castigliano's second theorem. First we must determine degree of structural indeterminacy which determine number of redundant. Remove all redundant force and/or redundant member until structural determinate condition. Second, analyze for determinate structure, and we get all value or redundant. Apply of structure boundary condition to determine the real value of redundant. Finally, we must check the value of redundant which appropriate with equilibrium principles. For example, you may give us an example of indeterminate truss structure.

8b3668d19e31088bc29e9f6289da8362aa	In chemistry, those reactions that create entropy are more likely to occur (there are some other factors but generally speaking it is true).  When considering that the human body requires complex reactions that create less entropy through highly ordered pre-existing processes and we "started" as nothing, then no, chance could not have created us.  A protein molecule is a highly ordered low entropy molecule.  It could not just spontaneously create itself without the right balance of elements each at the necessary temperature and pressure in the same area of the world.  The odds of creating just one protein molecule was calculated to be in the 1in 10 x 10^23 or something close to that number (near impossible odds).|`|AA11105711	For entropy to be lowered, energy is required.

d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Well, the different between air and helium on the weight of the balloon is marginal, so you would expect little or no observable distance.     But in principle its not as simple as is being made out here. Think for a moment about what keeps a ball up and what brings it down. Its hit into the air at first, and then a combination of gravity and air resistance bring it down.     In a vacuum the trajectory would depend only on initial velocity, because kinetic energy and potential energy both depend linearly on mass (so it cancels). In air the air resistance is proportional to square of the speed and size but not mass.    Now, about that kick. Does it give 1) constant energy independent of the mass of the ball, 2) constant speed to the ball independent of its mass     If 1) then the heavier ball will be slower when kicked, so will not go as far    If 2) then the distance will be the same in vacuum as above but the larger ball will have more energy and so will take longer to slow by drag - it will go further|`|AA10371519	no it won't as seen on the mythbusters' latest episode!!!!!!!   however having an air filled football is an advantage as it has greater weight and will have more inertia and should travel more distance according to newtonian physics!!|`|AA11206283	Mythbusters did this with a kicked football and found no appreciable difference between balls.|`|AA10223886	What is the mass of helium and air in the two cases? what about volume of foot ball?

You should change doors.  The door you originally chose still has a 33% chance, while the other door now has a 50% chance of being the "winning" door.

It's counterintuitive, but if our intuition were worth a nickel it would be a happier planet, wouldn't it?

If the door was opened randomly (in other words, there was a chance that there was something behind it) then it wouldn't matter, but the door was chosen smartly by whomever opened it.    If you don't believe it, here is an experiment.    Take three playing cards A, K, and Q.  Have someone mix them up.  Pick a card, and have the other person flip over a card that isn't a Q.  Then tally the number of times that you should have switched (you are trying to get the Q) to the number of times you shouldn't.  Try it, in the end you should see a 2:3 trend to switching.  It has been explained correctly mathematically, if you don't believe it, try it.|`|9ad094e891a7977f96627e12ae1b5fe2aa	With 3 doors you had a 33.3% chance of guessing the correct one (1 out of 3). Now you have 2 doors, so you have a 50% chance of guessing the correct one (1 out of 2). I would probably just stick with the door I originally guessed.|`|17dd780c9f1266ef129223b4f8025902aa	Some people would reason as follows:  When you choose a door, the chances of the prize being behind one of the other two doors is 2:3.  But once one of those other two doors are opened to not reveal the prize, then the remaining (unopened, unchosen) door maintains the 2:3 chance, and thus you have a greater chance of finding the prize if you switch your decision.    This is absolutely incorrect.    The revelation of one door alters the probability of the remaining two doors, because you now know that the revealed door is empty.  The probably then reverts to 1:2 chances for each of the remaining doors.    The fallicy can easily be shown by considering if there were only two doors to begin with.  Beforehand, the probability of choosing the correct door is 1:2.  But if the 2nd door were opened and shown to be empty, then the probability for the first door does NOT remain 1:2.  The revelation of the empty second door changes the probability of your original choice to be exactly 1:1.    (The infamous counterintuitive solution is achieved when the host who shows the empty door knows which of the two doors is empty.  Then the host's knowledge is also a part of the equation, not just your own.  If this were the case, then it is always beneficial to switch your choice.  Your original question, however, does not state if the empty door was opened randomly or by an intelligent selection from the host.)|`|fa92069a21cd9c63d8ae980fe52ca059aa	This very question was on an episode of NUMB3RS earlier this year.

Was the door opened by someone who knew what was behind all three doors?  If so, you should definitely switch doors to the remaining one that you didn't pick.    But if it was chosen randomly, and just happened to be empty, then switching neither helps nor hinders you.    Therefore, you should switch, because it might help and it can't hurt. :)|`|a84d8ab7306f51b9cb471b8cdcff7dccaa	Since there is 2 remaining doors which may or may not have the prize behind it each door has a 1in 2 chance of hiding the prize.  Changing doors does not change your odds in any way.  Choosing a door could essentially be compared to flipping a coin.  Each side of the coin has an equal opportunity to come up and each door has an equal opportunity of hiding the prize.

Usage Note: The question of when to use nominative forms of the personal pronouns (for example, I, she, they) and when to use objective forms (for example, me, her, them) has always created controversy among grammarians and uncertainty among speakers and writers. There is no problem when the pronoun stands alone with a single verb or preposition: every native speaker says I (not me) read the book; They told him (not he); The company bought a computer for us (not we); and so forth. But the decision is more problematic in other environments. When pronouns are joined with other nouns or pronouns by and or or, there is a widespread tendency to use the objective form even when the phrase is the subject of the sentence: Tom and her are not speaking to each other. This usage is natural in colloquial speech, but the nominative forms should be used in formal speech and writing: John and she (not her) will be giving the talk. When pronouns joined by a conjunction occur as the object of a preposition such as between, according to, or like, many people use the nominative form where the traditional grammatical rule would require the objective; they say between you and I rather than between you and me, and so forth. Many critics have seen this construction as originating in a hypercorrection, whereby speakers who have been taught to say It is I instead of It is me come further to assume that correctness also requires between you and I in place of between you and me. This explanation of the tendency cannot be the whole story, inasmuch as the phrase between you and I occurs in Shakespeare, centuries before the prescriptive rules requiring It is I and the like were formulated. But the between you and I construction is nonetheless widely regarded as a marker of grammatical ignorance and is best avoided. In other contexts the traditional insistence that the nominative form be used is more difficult to defend. The objective form sounds most natural when the pronoun is not grammatically related to an accompanying verb or preposition. Thus, in response to the question Who cut down the cherry tree? we more colloquially say Me, even though some grammarians have argued that I must be correct here by analogy to the form I did and few speakers would accept that the sentence What, me worry? is improved if it is changed to What, I worry? The prescriptive insistence that the nominative be used in such a construction is grammatically questionable and is apt to lead to almost comical pedantries. There is also a widespread tendency to use the objective form when a pronoun is used as a subject together with a noun in apposition, as in Us engineers were left without technical support. In formal speech or writing the nominative we would be preferable here. But when the pronoun itself appears in apposition to a subject noun phrase, the use of the nominative form may sound pedantic in a sentence such as The remaining members of the admissions committee, namely we, will have to meet next week. A writer who is uncomfortable about using the objective us here would be best advised to rewrite the sentence to avoid the difficulty.|`|AA11301210	Is is What ?|`|9e11fbe3aaa779006aba92d5140745a9aa	This is not a question, yet a statement.

Let's say that we somehow figure out a way to overcome the  second law of thermodynamics, we still need to find a way to travel at the speed of light. Einstein's equation E=mc^2 says that as we approach the speed of light everything slows down, and it also takes more energy to continue to move at the speed of light. Soon it takes an infinite amount of energy to move us. Let's say we overcome this, as well. We need to assume that time isn't linear (as in Past --> Present --> future). In order for us to be able to travel into the past, time would need to be in more of a pretzel shape.    Hope this helps!

A typical Virgo (without considering other rising, moon influences, ect.) is rather high strung and nervous. They are super analytical and critical, even if they try not to be ...they can spot a flaw from a mile away ...which makes them do good in fields of work that require attention to detail. Most are some of the most helpful people you'll ever meet -- they are the first to help a sick friend or do the dishes after a dinner party, ect. (typically, remember ...not always :)).  They live in their minds ... some with water signs for moons experience more emotional responses, ect., but generally Virgos think things out very rationally, ect.

When we got bigger tractors we had cabs but no AC and left the doors off and windows open and it was okay, but when we got tractors over 150 hp the noise and heat got really bad outside the cab.

AA11522841	Yes! This is one of the most frustrating realizations in the history of physics! All of our physical laws (expect a few special cases near the plank length in very special conditions) are fully reversible in space and time.    1) The second law says that entropy always increases, but that formulation is based on summing up the motions of billions of particles that make up a system under study. In theory, those particles are governed by classical and quantum physics, and so if we really wanted to, we could accurately predict their movement in time. HOWEVER, our laws are time-symmetric, and so if those laws imply that entropy increases towards the future, it must also increase towards the past!    3) Clearly, this means that either this exact moment that you are witnessing now is somehow the -least entropic- moment in ALL of history, OR that the conditions during the big bang created enough symmetry for entropy to be close to zero, so that entropy has simply continually increased with time since that moment. Finding out why and how that low entropy was achieved has been considered the crowning achievement of modern astrophysics. Essentially, it was discovered that the universe underwent massive, unimaginable expansion for a brief fraction of a second that spread everything out almost perfectly evenly, creating a very low entropy universe.    3) Tricky subject, and in my opinion, not one for scientists to debate, lets leave that for the philosophers, shall we?    Greenguy - get out of the math and science section, you hippy|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	Many laws of physics are invariant under time reversal.    The second law is not one of them.    This is because it is an inequality.    It has dramatic implications for the Big Bang. It means that the Big Bang was a uniquely special event, with an exceptionally low entropy. It is not fully understood how it came to be so special, and modern theories like M-theory fall down badly on this too.    Contrary to what some here say, the second law is a very fundamental law that applies equally in the quantum realm. Finding something that broke the second law would be more shattering to the laws of physics than finding something travelling faster than the speed of light or breaking the law of conservation of mass.    I can't see that it has any implications on free will.|`|5ac8006f929381dbb809076e27f32940aa	Time is actually an illusion, a man-made, thought driven phantom.  Time is what our minds use to create two points in a random, constantly changing universe. We think on something that did happen and compare it to something that is happening now, or something we think will happen later. It is also the source of all pain.    There is nothing that is constant and permanent in the universe anywhere, except for 'nothing' itself. Things are always in flux and in a vibratory state. For example, the desk or table that your computer is on, it is not still, the atoms in the object are actually moving at such a fast rate that you can not pass through it.    As for free will, what is it? All of your decisions are based upon thoughts. All of your thoughts are based upon events that 'have' happened, so in essence all any of us do is repeat things that have happened...unless your actions come from 'no-mind', the state of not thinking. The animals do this, but in a lesser form then humans are capable of.|`|AA10717163	time is not symmertrical. ever wonder why at some times, time passes by quickly and at other times, time goes slowly?|`|3ee76e563028e59e546153a60a20c4dbaa	Think of time like North and South on Earth.  Let's say that the North Pole is the Big Bang (zero time).  When we think "Well, what came before the Big Bang?" we should think "Well, what's more North than the North Pole?" The answer to both questions is 'nothing'.  So, really, the Big Bang is just another point on the map of time.  There's no boundary (just like there's no boundary to the surface of the Earth- no one has fallen of the Earth) but it is still finite.  As far as entropy is concerned, entropy increases when time increases (moves towards the positive).  If time decreases (moves in the negative direction), entropy would also decrease (giving us our symmetry).  We can only experience time going forward, so this doesn't have any real implication on free will.  Even if it is an 'illusion', it's one we can't overcome, so it doesn't seem to matter.  Not enough is really understood about the potential to manoeuvre through time, so until that happens, it would be tough to say how that would affect our perception.

Simply charge a plate of metal (for example) and slide it into the sole of a shoe made of a non-conducting material (such as rubber).  The charged plate will now be attracted to neutral and oppositely-charged (semi-/conducting) materials.  Assuming that the surface that you want to be able to walk on is made of such a material (and charged accordingly), the shoe will be attracted to the floor and it will feel like gravity is acting on the shoe.    This simply exploits the fact that positively-charged substances are attracted to neutral and negatively-charged substances (and vice-versa).  Make something in the shoes positively-charged and it will be attracted to a neutrally- or negatively charged floor.

fc0b719eb616ba86e30fd23f51659547aa	This is hard to do without showing, so first I would recommend searching for pedigrees online and finding some pictures to go along with.  You will probably find a better explanation that what I'm going to attempt.      If you do a pedigree and represent all of your family members, you will be able to see if a trait is dominant pretty easily (most of the time).  For example, let's say your grandpa has 6 fingers on one hand.  He marries grandma with the normal 5.  They have five children, only one of which with the 6 fingered trait.  This really doesn't tell you anything since a Punnett square will only show the probability (chances of having a boy over a girl are only 50/50, yet there are some families with 5 boys).  But if you look at the next generation, you will be able to tell.  Say that an aunt of your did not have the 6 fingered condition, but your cousin (her son) did.  If neither of your cousin's parents had the trait but he did, that must be b/c it is recessive.      Of course, polydactility (having extra digits) is actually dominant, so if somebody in your family has the trait, chances are it will be passed down.    The exceptions to this pedigree thing are sex-linked traits or traits that exhibit non-mendelian inheritance.  You can still use a pedigree, but you need lots of people to make a good assumption.|`|3dfb201377614485b8a127a6fa44ab0aaa	With a pedigree diagram, look for instances where a the two traits are combined.  The recessive trait has a much lower probability of being the outcome.    Also, look for one trait that has been repeated throughout several generations.  You can be reasonable sure that the trait is pure, then merge it with the other trait, and if the other trait is dominant, it will occur instead of the first one.|`|4f55a0a97613b96963a9649a99af0975aa	get out a biology book and do your own homework.|`|50118a1e9395a0a87d87cdc786b17492aa	First of all - if this is homework, find out if it specifically states that non-related members of the family (in-laws) can also have the trait.  That is, if you are researching Disease X in a family, can members who marry into the family also have Disease X?    For homework, 80% of the time, I would assume that they cannot; that is, in-laws do not carry any disease-producing alleles.  They are wild-type.    Then look at the pedigree.  Traits that skip generations tend to be recessive traits (dominant traits are SEEN in every person that has them; only recessive traits "hide out".)  Look at the first Punnett square on the wikipedia article.    Traits that are more prevalent in men than in women are sex-linked (because the man only needs one recessive allele to get the trait; he is what we call hemizygous.)      If you determine that a trait is sex-linked, then you must decide if it is on the X or Y chromosome.  If it is on the Y chromosome, ONLY males will have the trait, but ALL males will have it (if their father has it).  If it is on the X chromosome, all males will have it (if their mother has Disease X or is a carrier) and some females will have it.

Very few reactions truelly occur without the addition of heat.  This heat is called the activation energy.  Now, this heat can come from anywhere.  This includes the warmth of the kitchen drawer.  If you remove as much energy/heat as possible, the reaction goes slower.  The slower the reaction, the longer the battery life.  You can significantly extend the battery life by cooling it.    Wow... overheating... I have to tell that one to my grad students!|`|991f48446cb90689611a35eb06c0219caa	phduh? chemical reactions give off heat, doc. batteries in use get hot. batteries in stasis do nothing, in a fridge: do less, ie. you reduce quantum electron activity, but in order to discharge a battery you have to complete a circuit. If it kept best cold , wal-mart would have the batteries next to the produce.

23a6d4fc1d0662b409519416579f1789aa	It would mean the galaxies were moving more slowly and would have taken longer to reach their present position. Meaning that more time had gone by since the Big Bang.|`|d0bda7c229a405e70f5cb289deec30aeaa	How can something that has been measured change to be smaller? Its a constant for goodness sake.|`|AA11953908	In response to the first person, the Hubble constant is not measured in the same way you measure the size of your living room. Instead, we measure both the distance to far away galaxies and their velocity. The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it moves away from us. So the Hubble constant is merely the relationship between the distance and the speed. For every thousand light years away you look, the speed has gone up a certain amount. And even now, it is not an exact figure, but a range, with different studies having some disagreement.    How could it change? Picturing what the Hubble constant is we can see that it requires accurate measurements of the distance. As our accuracy in measuring those distances has increased, the distance measurements have changed, which has changed our view of what the Hubble constant is.    So if we were to discover those galaxies are farther away than we thought, it would mean the constant is smaller, that for 1000 light years, the increase in speed is not as much as we thought. So we would have been right about the speed, but wrong in that the galaxies were farther away than we realized.    Since they would be farther away than we now think we would see (and still traveling the same speed) we would see that it took them longer to get there. And that would mean the universe has had to be around longer than we thought it did. Therefore the change would be that the universe is older than we had realized.

However, friction decreases with smoothness only to a degree; friction actually increases between two extremely smooth surfaces because of increased attractive electrostatic forces between their atoms. Friction does not depend on the amount of surface area in contact between the moving bodies or (within certain limits) on the relative speed of the bodies. It does, however, depend on the magnitude of the forces holding the bodies together. When a body is moving over a horizontal surface, it presses down against the surface with a force equal to its weight, i.e., to the pull of gravity upon it; an increase in the weight of the body causes an increase in the amount of resistance offered to the relative motion of the surfaces in contact.

Or do you mean are there substances which should be magnetic but for some unknown reason aren't?    Generally non-charged systems or non-polarized systems don't interact strongly with magnets, but I dunno if that answers your question... The more polarized the constituent atoms and molecules of a substance are the more strongly current flows and the more strongly it interacts with a magnetic field. Though heating of said objects increases kinetic motion and can destroy the polarization and the magnetic properties...

8626bc6b9ef763fc725fe1ad1f9ad2deaa	Cold Fusion is still a theory. It is almost the same as a normal Fusion Reaction (the same type of reaction as our Sun produces). Combine two Hydrogen Atoms to make a Heleium Atom and alot of heat and very little radiation. Normaly to get a Fusion Reaction requires a great amount of preasure and heat. The Cold Fussion theory states that if you can get the Hydrogen atoms closer to each other you would need only a fraction of the heat normaly needed to start the reaction. This is due to the Uncertainty Princible.     It could be a great source of energy and would be possible to turn on and off the reaction, almost like a switch. It would be much safer and less poluting Nuclear Reactors that we have today. All the current ones are Fission Based.|`|AA10836764	Combining Hydrogen atoms.

It's like saying you don't believe in the existence of water because we invented a measuring cup, so if we never invented the cup, the ocean must not be there.  Currently, the time machine is only a fictional device -- the technology required to move someone through the space-time continuum in any way other than the one we experience (forward, one second at a time) is way too far beyond our capability.  Plus, depending on what version of physics you subscribe to, the universe might ultimately not allow it, because of temporal paradoxes -- if you went back in time and shot yourself, then who came back in time to shoot you if you were already dead?    As for the future, who knows?  Einstein-Rosen bridges might allow it, or some funny quantum mechanical quirks might present a way to do it, but since those require either creating black holes or (probably) violating Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, I doubt it'll happen any time soon.

[This is important for the next step, which I will explain soon. :) ] Thus we have:    (3X + 10)^(1/2) -- 2 + 2 = X + 2    (The 2s on the left-side obviously cancel out!):    (3X + 10)^(1/2) = X + 2    Next, since working with square roots is so tedious, the easiest way to work around this is to square both sides.    [Note: By squaring the square root you're reversing the operation of taking the square root. In math, taking a square root means raising something to the power of 1/2 [like X^(1/2)].    Whereas squaring something means raising it to the power of 2 (like X^2).    When you raise something to one of these powers then the other, they cancel out, because the powers are multiplied, wherein you're multiplying a whole number (2) by a fraction (1/2). So the (2) cancels out with the denominator of the fraction (2). As a result, the X in this example ends up being raised only to the power of 1, which doesn't change it!    It looks like this: (X^2)^(1/2)  Or like this: [X^(1/2)]^2    [since I can't put them on top of each other, as I can on paper, this will have to do & you'll have to use your imagination. :) ]    I hope this doesn't come across as condescending. I was just trying to be helpful. :) ]    Back to the question at hand. So far we have:    (3X + 10)^(1/2) = X + 2    Squaring both sides yields:    3X + 10 = X^2 + 4X + 4    Next, we move everything on the right-side to the left side, so we can add or subtract like terms with/from each other. Thus we have:    3X -- 4X + 10 -- 4 -- X^2 = 0    This simplifies into:    -- X + 6 -- X^2 = 0    Next, out of convenience, I'll multiply both sides by -- 1 to make the coefficient of X^2 positive, as it is easier to work with! :) Thus we now have:    X^2 + X -- 6 = 0    Conveniently, this can be factored out. :)    [Note: We're looking for two numbers that multiply to give -- 6 and add up to 1. 3 -- 2 = 1, and 3 & -- 2 multiply to yield -- 6! So the numbers we're looking for are 3 & -- 2!    Once again, I don't mean to appear condescending. I'm just trying to clarify everything, just to be sure you easily understand the operations being applied to solve this equation! :) ]    So, last we got: X^2 + X -- 6 = 0    Factored out this yields:    (X + 3)(X -- 2) = 0    Either X + 3 = 0, thus X = -- 3  OR  X -- 2 = 0, thus X = + 2    Since the question doesn't specify how X is defined, it is not clear which, if either, of these numbers is disqualified. So, for now, either answer is an acceptable value for X and, when substituted it back into the equation, will reduce it to 0!      I hope this helps. :) If you ever need any other help, just drop me a line. :) I'll be glad to give you a hand. :)  Good luck and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

6pUzzsuhaa	i honestly don't believe that any organic farming is good (besides being somewhat good for the land, other than that, its useless in my opinion)     GM crops/seeds are healthier and withstand many different conditions found in many different environments. also GM (genetically modified) crops produce a higher yield so that means more profit for the farmer (but how much profit a farmer makes also depends on the acreage of the farm too)     organic farming wouldn't be able to supply enough yield for how many people consume what crops produce. like say if my boyfriend switched to organic, him and his family (he farms with his uncle and grandpa) would go broke because chemicals control the weed population and if the weeds over run the field, it will "choke" out the cotton, also, they use RoundUp Ready Cotton seed too, so they get the benefit of being able to use RoundUp on the weeds and the cotton won't be affected by it.     another thing that is big with cotton (besides boll weevils) is white-flies- they'll ruin a cotton crop quickly and with out any chemicals, then again, his crop would suffer greatly.     also, using chemicals for weed control is more beneficial than plowing for weed control- plowing breaks the soil and 'churns' it, so the moist soil is put where the dry soil was and the dry soil is 'put' where the moist soil was- near the roots, so thus, the crop won't be able to get as much water it needs    without chemicals- fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc..- farmers wouldn't be able to produce enough to supply the growing number of people around the world, not just in the USA      Jimmy V-- if you downing farmers so, get out of the Ag. section! simple-   a farmer has to be VERY smart to run his/her farm properly- you have to do a good bit of math also, like how much chemical do you need for a certian number of acres or how much disel fuel you'll need to make it that day or how much seed you need to plant.   and with out farming- you'd be naked and broke and starving!! Farming is the BACKBONE of our nation! [i could go on about what you've said and probably will keep saying, but i'm not, this isn't the place for it- with out farmers, you wouldn't be here!  you really need to go talk to a farmer and meet a farmer and get to know him/her very well before you go downing farmers by saying it's for people who 1 want to be away from the city or its for people with no education- farmers are (probably more than likely) smarter than you, like you could run a farm by your self, you couldn't]      * Got food and clothes? Thank a FARMER! *|`|Ippd6MuPaa	I think it depends on whether you are buying fertilizer or not. If you can keep enough manure and straw on the land and possibly second crop with buckwheat or clover to smother the weeds then it starts to make sense.  If you are paying for manure and taking all the straw off as well as the grain it ceases to make a lot of sense.  If you are just monocropping without putting anything back you are just depleting your soil.  If you are putting all the chemicals in then all your soil is doing is letting the roots hold the plant upright and soil depletion is not part of the equation anymore.  Also a lot of land is already so bad that it could take 50 or 100 years to make it good enough to farm without chemicals again, if it was ever that good to start with..    Organic farming can be competitive, but it really has to be thought of as a business decision.    It is still something that you have to sit down with a calculator yourself and work out the balance between inputs, opportunity cost and yields for your land.  You might find you don't want to grow wheat at all on a lot of the land and would be better growing pasture instead.    ----  Not a farmer, but some relatives are.|`|3H1xwgf9aa	i do... its just planting stuff then waiting for it to grow then taking it out the waiting for some company to hopefully buy it... i think it's for people who 1 want to be away from the city or its for people with no education

The rest you should then be able to do on your own. :)    1) 2X^2 + 17X -- 9    To factor it, you want to rewrite it into this format:    2X^2 + 17X -- 9 = (aX + b)(cX + d),    where a*c = 2, a*d + b*c = 17, & b*d = -- 9    Now, only 1*2 = 2 & both 1*9 = 9 & 3*3 = 9    So we have the following possiblities:    (X + 3)(2X -- 3), but 2*3 + 3*-- 1 = 6 -- 3 = 3, NOT 17.    (X -- 3)(2X + 3), but 1*3 + 2*-- 3 = 3 -- 6 = -- 3, NOT 17.    (X + 1)(2X -- 9), but 1*2 + 1*-- 9 = 2 -- 9 = -- 7, NOT 17.    (X -- 1)(2X + 9), but 1*9 + 2*-- 1 = 9 -- 2 = 7, NOT 17.

You solve it by using the following formula:  x1,2(because there can be at least 2 possible solutions)=(-b +/- b^2 - 4ac ("b^2 - 4ac" is squared)) / (2a)=?  You solve it and then you have two solutions(x1 and x2), because of the +/-(when the expression that is squared is equal to zerro, then there is only one solution)  And...Then( I hope that this is not to complicated:))) you use this equation: a(x-x1)(x-x2) you use what you have from the previous solving and...  THERE YOU GO!  You solved the trinomial! Cheers!  P.S. Please if I helped you with what I have written to you above, please write in the details for you question, so I could know if I had helped you somehow. Bye!

Las manecillas en cada uno de ellos, si se leen de  izquierda a derecha te da los miles-centenas-decenas y unidades de kilowatthora consumidos en un periodo determinado. El cobro se hace por cada kilowatthora consumido (algo as como un peso o dos, dependiendo el tipo de contrato que tengas). De modo que para saber tu consumo de energa en un periodo-X, debes leer las 4 cifras indicadas en las peque?as cartulas y restarlas de la lectura hecha en el periodo anterior. La operacin anterior  te dar una diferencia que a su vez tendrs que multiplicar por el costo unitario del kilowatthora (este costo viene en tu recibo). Fcil, no?

Though lots of rumour about UFO spread out, there is no 100% evidence for alien existence! All we see are from movie!  If you are Christian, then you should not believe in rumour about UFO and aliens. Because bible only state that earth and human beings is unique in universe....  In science, we can make such assumption:  1)for life to survive, the planet shall be not too hot or too cold.  2)There shall be water and atmosphere to keep life continue survive.  3)Our earth's location is appropriately distant from sun.  If our earth slightly far away from sun, then all the surfaces of earth will be covered wtih ice.  If our earth slightly close to sun, then all teh surface of earth will be vaporized.  4)If there is no atmosphere at earth, all oxygen will escape from earth...  5)From evolution theory, the lifes will take billion of years to evolve into high intelligent creartures.  So, the possiblitiy for life exists is very very very small in universe.  But, remember, even there is another planet have similar condition and appropriate location from star somewhere else in other galaxies, the planet will first be destroyed by the expanding star before lifes evolve into advanced creatures.  Furthermore, the ditance from one galaxy to another galaxy is very very far (measured in light year).  No other matter can travel faster than light.  So, it is impossible for lifes in other planet to communicate with us in earth!  So, one day, our sun will expand and burn out our earth....end of the world!

AA11468672	Howdy & I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question:    a) 16X^2 -- 8X -- 15    b) 5X^4 + 2X^2 -- 7    c) X^3 -- 13X^2 + 30X    For a generic quadratic expression aX^2 + bX + c, to factor, you need to rewrite it into a product of 2 brackets of expressions, such that they multiply into the expression:    aX^2 + bX + c = (dX + e)(fX + g),    wherein a = d*f, b = d*g + e*f, & c = e*g    For a cubic expression, the only difference is that the aim is to re-write it into 3 brackets of expressions. But, sometimes, it can only be rewritten into 2 expressions, one of them a quadratic expression that can't be factored!    So:    a) 16X^2 -- 8X -- 15    a = 16, b = -- 8, & c = -- 15    1*16 = 16, 2*8 = 16, & 4*4 = 16, & 1*15 = 15, & 3*5 = 15    But, 1*16 & 1*15 are too large. That narrows the possibilities to 2*8, & 4*4 for 16, & 3*5 for 15:    (2X -- 3)(8X + 5), but 2*5 -- 3*8 = 10 -- 24 = -- 14    (8X -- 3)(2X + 5), but 5*8 -- 2*3 = 40 -- 6 = 34    (2X + 3)(8X -- 5), but 3*8 -- 2*5 = 24 -- 10 = 14    (8X + 3)(2X -- 5), but 2*3 -- 5*8 = 6 -- 40 = -- 34    (4X -- 3)(4X + 5), but 4*5 -- 3*4 = 20 -- 12 = 8    (4X + 3)(4X -- 5), 3*4 -- 4*5 = 12 -- 20 = -- 8    Thus, a) 16X^2 -- 8X -- 15 factors into: (4X + 3)(4X -- 5).      Using the same principle,    b) 5X^4 + 2X^2 -- 7    a = 5, b = 2, & c = -- 7    Here we have 8 possibilities:    (X + 7)(5X -- 1) & (5X -- 1)(X + 7), but 5*7 -- 1*1 = 35 -- 1 = 34    (X -- 7)(5X + 1) & (5X + 1)(X -- 7), but 1*1 -- 35 = -- 34    (5X + 7)(X -- 1) & (5X -- 7)(X + 1), but 1*5 -- 1*7 = 5 -- 7 = -- 2    (X + 1)(5X -- 7), but 1*5 -- 1*7 = 5 -- 7 = -- 2    (X -- 1)(5X + 7) 1*7 -- 1*5 = 7 -- 5 = 2    Thus, b) 5X^4 + 2X^2 -- 7 factors into: (X -- 1)(5X + 7).      Using the same principle,    c) X^3 -- 13X^2 + 30X    First, we factor the X out, to yield a quadratic expression:    X^3 -- 13X^2 + 30X = X(X^2 -- 13X + 30),    wherein a = 1, b = -- 13, & c = 30    1*1 = 1, & 1*30 = 30, 2*15 = 30, 3*10 = 30, & 5*6 = 30    But, 1*30 & 2*15 can't be used, because the 15 & 30 are too large. Whereas 5*6 is too small to yield 13. That leaves 3*10 & the following possibility:    (X -- 3)(X -- 10), 1*-- 3 + 1*-- 10 = -- 3 -- 10 = -- 13    Thus, X^3 -- 13X^2 + 30X factors into: X(X -- 3)(X -- 10).

AA11468672	Howdy & I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question:    What you're looking for are theorems & proven formulas. The 2 most popular & most used are the concept of cross-multiplication & the distance, time & speed formula:    Distance = Time*Speed    Usually, they're used in tandem:    I want to drive from Toronto to City X & I'm allowed to drive 100Km/Hr, while the distance is Y Km. So how long is it going to take me to get there?    1 Hr------>100 Km  X Hr------>Y Km    You cross multiply & solve for either X or Y, depending on which of the 2 is given.    A word about problem solving: First, be clear what is being asked, for example volume. Then determine the appropriate formula(s) that you will need to solve that question. Then identify how many of the components of the formula are given.    This is critical, because, to improve a student's problem solving skills, math text authors usually put too much information, that you won't need to solve the question. That way you will improve at identifying the relevant and important facts and be able to identify the relationship(s) between them more quickly & more easily.    Once you know all the theorems & formulas that a person of your grade level should know, and know them well, the only thing that will be the difference between success & failure, doing them easily & quickly & doing them with difficulty is PRACTICE. Get your hands on as many problems as you can. Go to the library & borrow 10 books if you have to. Nothing else will make as much of a difference.    The same is true for such things as factoring, solving equations etc. But not as much as for problems, because the concepts of equations & factoring are often incorporated into solving problems anyway!    Another thing you can do is to pay attention in your daily life.  But you're not usually aware of that, like when you decide if you have enough time to do something or how much X number of items will cost. You actually apply the concepts of problem solving, forming equations, & solving said equations in the various situations of your daily life.    You don't usually notice because math problems are presented in a particular way in a math textbook. And because they are in said textbook, you immediately identify them as problems. But, in daily life, you're focused on other things (I want to go the movies with a couple of friends & I'm going to pick up the tickets for all of us before-hand. Since 1 ticket costs $X, I'll need to have $Y when I go to pay for them!)    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

Let the end painter be B.    We are given that A spent 12 weeks alone.    We are futher given that when B joined A, they spent another 8 weeks.    So we have:    A + B = 12 + 8    A + B = 20    Next, we are given that B alone needs 24 weeks. That is:    B = 24    We are asked to determine A.    To do that, we substitute B's value into the above equation. We get:    A + 24 = 20    To solve for A, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation (both sides so as to preserve its equality, of course, as I'm sure you well know. :) ).

She does so, holding him by his Achilles tendon.  So he grows up and starts fighting.  Low and behold, he is invincible- nothing is stopping this dude.

Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.    4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.    5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.    6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.    7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.    8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.    9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.    10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.    11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.    12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

I think Catal Huyuk, in Turkey, was near a lake.  But within the last few hundred years, I think that the railroad was the most important transportation link for the start of modern cities, so that they could trade.  Far earlier, the development of the stirrup enabled traders to open up trade routes, like the Silk Road, and that led to interior cities growing.  But then, it could be argued that textile development (weaving on a loom) was a trade stimulus, as was the development of copper smelting.  I think, however, the answer you are looking for is the railroad.
AA11468672	Howdy! :)    I sure hope you're doing well. :)  As for the exercise:    3 -- 22/(x+5)= (6x+1)/(2x+7)    First, simplify the left side by creating a common denominator:    3 -- 22/(x+5)= [3(x + 5) -- 22]/(x + 5)= (3x + 15 -- 22)/(x + 5)=  (3x -- 7)/(x + 5).    Now the original expression looks like this:    (3x -- 7)/(x + 5) = (6x+1)/(2x+7)    Now cross-multiply: multiply the numerator of the left side by the denominator of the right side. And multiply the numerator of the right side by the denominator of the left side. As follows:    (3x -- 7)(2x+7) = (6x+1)(x + 5)    Now simplify by multiplying the terms of the brackets for both sides:    6x^2 + 21x -- 14x -- 49 = 6x^2 + 30x + x + 5    Now bring all the x terms to the left side and the numbers to the right side and all the terms on both sides:    -- 24x = 54    (6x^2 -- 6x^2 + 21x -- 14x -- 30x -- x = 49 + 5)    Now divide both by -- 6. You get:    4x = -- 9    Finally, divide both sides by 4 and that's the answer:    x = -- 9/4      I sure hope this helps. :) Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)|`|4e764c9cdfd2c44c4157eb0e558808b6aa	cross multiply and you'll get the answer!|`|BIuW8mJmaa	1) Cross multiply the denominirators.  2) Equalize & then slove further.

[(3/2J) + 50] = 8/7 (J + 50)    simplify the equation, solve for  "J";    3/2J + 50 = 8/7J + 400/7  3/2J - 8/7J = 400/7 - 50  5/14J = 50/7  J = 20; jannette's age when they were married, so she will be 70 years old on their golden wedding anniversary.    then, substitute the value of "J" to any of the 2 equations to find for the value of "F"...    F = 3/2J  F = 3/2*(20)  F = 30; Fidel's age when they were married, therefore he will be 80 years old on their golden wedding anniversay...      Got it?!!!|`|AA11468672	Howdy! :)    I sure hope you're doing well. :)  As for the question, we need to assign variables (letters of the alphabet) to Fidel's & Janette's ages to simplify solving the problem.  So:    Let Fred's age be Y and let Janette's age be X.    Now, we know from the question that when they got married, Y = (3/2)X    We also know that on their Golden Wedding Anniversary (their 50th anniversary to be exact!), Y + 50 = (8/7)(X + 50)    (Note: We obviously have to add 50 to both sides of the equation since they both grew by 50 years and the 8/7 ratio of their ages is at that point in time!)    To solve, we now substitute Y's value, (3/2)X, into the latter equation:    3/2)X + 50 = (8/7)(X + 50)    (3/2)X + 50 = (8X + 400)/7    We now multiply both sides by 14. We get:    21X + 700 = 16X + 800    Now we subtract 16X & 700 from both sides. We get:    21X -- 16X + 700 -- 700 = 16X -- 16X + 800 -- 700    5X = 100    X = 100/5    X = 20    AND    Y = (3/2)(20)    Y = 60/2 or 3x10    Y= 30.      Therefore, on their Golden Wedding Anniversery, Fidel is 70 years old (20 + 50) and Janette is 80 years old (30 + 50).      I sure hope that helped and was as clear as possible for you to understand the solution as easily as possible. :)  Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

However, math, like string theory, is just a set of abstractions. I think that although it is a useful model, it will ultimately fail, as it is too abstract and too complex. Simplicity is the ultimate goal of science, and models that increase complexity, such as string theory, are mere placeholders. I do like the notion of more dimensions, but the manner in which string theory defines dimensions is not very useful or meaningful in anything other than a mathematical manner.|`|eafb0f39539e658ad56ffda449c59a70aa	It seems to me that if you invoke enough dimensions you can justify anything.  The final proof of a theory is experimental evidence.  I don't think evidence for string theory is possible because they are so small.

If you are not prompted for the current time and date when you start up your computer = this indicates it is not a battery issue either.

yCmzDneGaa	2x2 - x - 3 / 3x2 - 7x + 4 divided by 2x2 + x - 6 / 3x2 + 2x - 8  simplifies first to     (1-x)/(10-7x) multiplied by (-2 + x)/ (-2 + 2x) ----> you multiply because division of fractions is the same as multiplying by the inverse (called flip and switch).    After you FOIL this, you have -x^2 + 3x + 2/-14x^2 +24x - 20.      If you want to remove the negative sign before the x^2, you can factor out -1 from the equation and you get:    x^2 - 3x - 2 / 14x^2 - 24x + 20|`|AA11468672	Happy Belated New Year! :)  I sure hope all is well. :)  As for your question, the following is my attempt to break down the solution for you. :)    The laws of fractions in Math dictate that, when fraction a/b is divided by another fraction, c/d, the second fraction is inverted then multiplied by the first fraction.  Meaning:    a/b / c/d =    a/b * d/c    So, the solution to your question would be:    [2X^2 -- x -- 3]  ----------------------  /  [3X^2 -- 7X + 4]    [2X^2 + X -- 6]  -----------------------   =  [3X^2 + 2X -- 8]      [2X^2 -- x -- 3]  ----------------------  *  [3X^2 -- 7X + 4]    [3X^2 + 2X -- 8]  ---------------------- =  [2X^2 + X -- 6]      Next, we factor everything to simplify.  That results in:      [(2X + 3)(X -- 1)]  -----------------------  *  [(3X -- 4)(X -- 1)]    [(3X -- 4)(X + 2)]  ----------------------- =  [(2X -- 3)(X + 2)]    (2X + 3)  ------------  (2X -- 3)      I tried putting all the fractions on one line, but they kept coming out scrambled, and so it wasn't clear what was being divided by what and what was being multiplied by what.  Too bad about that.  I hope that was clear enough for you and that it helps, just the same. :)  I did my best anyway. :)  Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)|`|i1bbRdV0aa	That's actually really easy.

AA11468672	Happy Belated New Year! :) I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question,    First of all, you did NOT include all of the dimensions of the paper. So I can't calculate the paper's area!    In any case, just calculate the paper's area (using the formula for a rectangle's area: Area = Length*Width), then subtract from it the area of the parallelgoram.    For the parallelgoram, remember that it's like a rectangle, except that the two "lengths" are slanted. Now, pretend that the two slanted sides are slanting to the right. Using that image as the shape of the parallelogram, extend the top side until it lines up with the bottom left-hand corner. Now extend a perpindicular line running from the bottom left-hand corner to the newly extended top side. Then, extend the bottom side until it lines up with the top right-hand corner. Now extend a perpindicular line running from the top right-hand corner to the newly extended bottom side. Now you've got a triangle on the left, a parallelgoram in the middle, and a triangle on the right. Together, they form a Big Rectangle. So, to calculate the area of the parallelgoram, simply subtract the areas of the 2 triangles from the area of the Big Rectangle.    Now, let X represent the segment stretching from the top left corner of the Big Rectangle to the top left-hand corner of the parallelgoram, which is the same as and equals the segment stretching from the bottom right-hand corner of the parallelgoram to the bottom right-hand corner of the Big Rectangle.    Since the area of a triangle is calculated according to the formula: Area = (Base*Height)/2, and since the 2 triangles are equal, then you only need to calculate the area of one triangle, then multiply by 2. That is: Area = Base*Height. And you subtract that from the area of the Big Rectangle.    So, for this parallelogram    --------------------  |/OOOOOOO/|  |/OOOOOOO/|  /----------------/---    (Note: I had to insert the "O"s in there, or the system would've otherwise shifted everything to the left!)    Area of parallelogram = Area of Big Rectangle -- Areas of 2 Triangles    Area of parallelogram = 11 inches*(22 inches + X inches)  -- [2*(11 inches*X inches)/2]    Simplifying yields:    Area of parallelogram = 242 inches^2 + 11X inches^2 -- 11X inches^2      Area of parallelogram = 242 inches^2    Therefore, the parallelogram has an area of 242 square inches.    Let Y represent the other side of the paper.    Thus the area of the paper would be:     Area of Paper = Y inches*60 inches    Area of Paper = 60Y inches^2    Now, once you calculate the area of the paper, you subtract from it the area of the parallelogram.    Remaining Area of Paper = Area of Paper -- Area of parallelogram    Remaining Area of Paper = 60Y inches^2 -- 242 inches^2    Remaining Area of Paper = 60Y -- 242 inches^2    Because of the paper's unknown side, this is the best that I can do. I hope it is clear enough and helps enough, just the same. :) If not, at least I tried my best. :) Good luck, take care and have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)|`|yCEuhQkaaa	area of //ogram=  base*height  = 11 in * 22 in  =242 in^2  therefore area of paper left over  = area of paper - 242in^2    * means 'to multiply'     good luck!~ im not so sure if im right though..^^

AA11468672	Howdy & I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question:    Okay, I'm not sure what you or the book mean by type.     Also, you should write it (-- 1/4)X^2. Otherwise, a person might think you meant -- 1/(4X^2), which is a completely different thing!    Otherwise, to use the given example,    The degree is 4, because the highest power of any of the variables in the expression is 4 (X^4).    The leading coefficient is 1, because the coefficient of X^4 is 1.    & the constant is 3, since it is the only term not attached to any variable.    Now if I misunderstood & it's supposed to be -- 1/(4X^2), then if there is such a thing as type of polynomial, then that's all that would change, since the power, leading coefficient & constant would still be the same!    In general, for a polynomial    aX^n + bX^(n -- 1) + cX^(n -- 2) ... + c,    The degree is n, the leading coefficient is a & the constant is c.    I wish I could tell you about type.  But I've never heard of polynomials having types. So I apologize for my ignorance. Hopefully someone else will be able to fill in that gap for you. :)    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

You have 6 different pots of flowers to put out on the steps. But you will use three of these pots. How many different possible combinations can you create?    ???    2. What is the area of a desk top 2 1/4 feet by 3 1/3 feet? Answer in a mixed number, with a space in between the integer and the fraction.    9/4 x 10/3 = 90/12 = 30/4 = 15/2 =   Seven and a half (7?) square feet.      3. What is the area of a sign 9 3/4 feet by 2 2/3 feet? Answer in a mixed number, with a space in between the integer and the fraction.    39/4 x 8/3 = 312/12 = 52/2 = 26 sq ft.       4. So a circle with a radius of 5 ft has an area of 25pi.  A circle with a radius of 7 ft has an area of 49pi.    What is the area of a circle with a radius of 10 ft?

For the 2nd pot, you have 5 possibilities.    & for the 3rd pot, you have 4 possibilities.    Thus: 6*5*4 = 120    But, if the positions are NOT to have duplicates, (as in the pots arranged in the format ABC & CBA, thus only the order is different, but the pots themselves being the same), then you'd have to divide by 2 for each duplicate of each pot. That is:    6*5*4/(2*2*2),    since there are 3 pots, hence 2*2*2.    That yields:    120/8 = 15    Therefore, either 120 combinations can be created, or, if duplicates are not allowed, then 15 combinations can be created.    2) There are two ways to calculate this. But I'll use the simpler method.    (The other method is to simply multiply the sum of the 2 fractions. That is: (2 + 1/4)*(3 + 1/3), since a complex fraction is the sum of a whole number/an integer & a fraction!):    2 1/4 feet = (2*4 + 1)/4 = (8 + 1)/4 = 9/4 feet    & 3 1/3 feet = (3*3 + 1)/3 = (9 + 1)/3 = 10/3 feet    The area of a rectangle (in this case the desk) is measured by the product of the length & width. Thus we have:    Area of Desk = (9/4 feet)*(10/3 feet)    Simplifying yields:    Area of Desk = (3/2 feet)*(5 feet)    Simplifying further yields:    Area of Desk = 15/2 square feet (or feet^2)    Therefore, expressed as a mixed fraction, the desk has an area of 7 1/2 square feet.    3) I'll follow the same method I used in question 2.    The length is 9 3/4 feet = (4*9 + 3)/4 = (36 + 3)/4 = 39/4 feet.    & the width is 2 2/3 feet = (2*3 + 2)/3 = (6 + 2)/3 = 8/3 feet.    Area of Sign = (39/4 feet)*(8/3 feet)    Simplifying yields:    Area of Sign = (13 feet)*(2 feet)    Simplifying further yields:    Area of Sign = 26 square feet.    Therefore, the sign has an area of 26 square feet.    4) The area of a circle with radius X is determined by the formula:    Area = Pi*(X^2).    Thus, for a circle with a radius of 10 feet, the area is:    Area = Pi*(10 feet^2)    Simplifying yields:    Area = Pi*(100 square feet)    Simplifying further yields:    Area = 100Pi square feet    Therefore, the area of a circle, with a radius of 10 feet, is 100Pi square feet.    5) The measure of one angle in an equilateral triangle = 60.    Note: The sum of the angles in ANY triangle is 180. Since all angles in an equilateral triangle are equal, then to determine the measure of one/any of them, simply divide 180 by 3, to yield 60.    6) 1 meter = 100 centimeters.     1 centimeter = 10 millimeters.     ---> 1 meter = 1000 millimeters.    (To confirm that, cross-multiply. The centimeters measures will cancel out, leaving the given equality.)    So:    1 meter = 1000 millimeters  X = 4 millimeters    Cross-multiplying yields:    X*1000 millimeters = (4 millimeters*1 meter)    To determine the value of X, we need to isolate it. To that end, we divide both sides of the equation (both sides so as to preserve the equation's equality) by 1000 millimeters. That yields:    X*1000 millimeters/1000 millimeters = (4 millimeters*1 meter)/1000 millimeters    Simplifying yields:    X = 0.004 meters    Therefore, 4 millimeters is 4 thousandth of a meter, or 0.004 meters.    7) 100W = 25W + 150    To solve for W, we need to unite the W-terms on one side of the equation. To that end, we subtract 25W from both sides of the equation. We get    100W -- 25W = 25W -- 25W + 150    Simplifying yields:    75W = 150    Finally, to solve for W, we divide both sides of the equation by 75. We get:    75W/75 = 150/75    Simplifying yields:    W = 2    Therefore, W = 2.    8) As you indicated, a decagon is 10-sided polygon. For an n-sided polygon, if you want to calculate the measure of one of its angles, then remember that the polygon is composed of n triangles, has n equal sides & n equal angles, composed of 2 adjacent angles of 2 adjacent triangles. For example, in a hexagon, there are 6 triangles. & each triangle has 2 angles along its base. Thus each two angles of neighbourint triangle add up to form one of the anlges of the hexagon.    So for a decagon, there are 10 triangles, for a total of:    10*180 = 1800.    But, the heads of all 10 triangles (their pointy ends if you like) all meet up to compose the centre. Since the centre measures 360, we'd have to subtract that from the total. Thus we have:    The sum of the angles along the bases of the 10 triangles in a decagon is:    1800 -- 360 = 1440.    But, as pointed out earlier, each pair compose one of the decagon's 10 angles. Thus, 10 angles have a total of 1440. Which means that 1 angle measures:    1440/10 = 144    Therefore, each angle in a decadon measures 144.    9) Since I've already calculated this in question 8, so as to calculate the measure of one the decagon's angles, I won't repeat the solution.    Thus, the total number of degrees in a decagon is 1440.    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

So:    {[X^(1/2)]/[X^(1/3)]}^(1/2) =    [X^(1/2 -- 1/3)]^(1/2) =    [X^(1/6)]^(1/2) =    Finally, a based raised to a power, raised to another power, is said base raised to the product of those 2 powers. So:    X^(1/12)    Now we can differentiate. According to the power rule:    d/dx X^(1/12) =    (1/12)*[X^(1/12 -- 1)] =    (1/12)*[X^(-- 11/12)] =    1/12*[X^(11/12)]    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)

And each wire is at an angle. Thus the required is a trigonometric ratio of the weight.

F (Wire) = (0.422618)*(215.6 N)    F (Wire) (approximately) = 91.116497 N    At 0, the wires would be vertical.

This means that a is 4.|`|AA11468672	Howdy & I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question:    According to Wikipedia Encyclopaedia,    "In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers, such that the difference of any 2 successive numbers is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13... is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2.    If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is a1 [1 is subscript] and the common difference of successive members is d, then the nth term of the sequence is given by:    an = a1 + (n -- 1)*d"    [n is subscript!]    The given sequence is: a, b, c, d, e,    wherein a1 = a.    We are given that:    b = 5.5    e = 10    b is the second term. So we have:    a2 = a + (2 -- 1)d    Simplifying yields:    a2 = a + d    Since a2 = 5.5, we have:    (1) a + d = 5.5    Meanwhile, e is the 5th term. So we have:    a5 = a + (5 -- 1)d    Simplifying yields:    a5 = a + 4d    Since a5 = 10    (2) a + 4d = 10    Next, we subtract (1) from (2), so as to determine d. We get:    a -- a + 4d -- d = 10 -- 5.5    Simplifying yields:    3d = 4.5    To solve for d, we divide both sides of the equation (both sides so as to preserve its value, of course, as I'm sure you well know. :) ) by 3. We get:    3d/3 = 4.5/3    Simplifying yields:    (3) d = 1.5    To find a, we substitute d's value from (3) into (1). We get:    a + 1.5 = 5.5    To solve for a, we subtract 1.5 from both sides of the equation. We get:    a + 1.5 -- 1.5 = 5.5 -- 1.5    Simplifying yields:    a = 4    Therefore, a = 4.    I sure hope that was as clear & as helpful as you needed it to be. :) Good luck, take care & have a great day. :)    Cheers! :)
AA11468672	Howdy & I sure hope all is well. :) As for your question:    1) 7RT/13 -- 9RT/13 = -- 2RT/13 Correct. :)    2) A/4 + 3A/4 = A Correct.    3) (5M^2)/3N + (7M^2)/3N = (4M^2)/3N Incorrect. :(    (5M^2)/3N + (7M^2)/3N =    (12M^2)/3N =    (4M^2)/N    Note: ^2 obviously means squared. :)    4) 23PQ/6P -- 17PQ/6P = 5Q/6 Incorrect. :(    23PQ/6P -- 17PQ/6P =    6PQ/6P =    Q    5) Y^2 + 5/(Y + 2) + 6Y + 3/(Y + 2) = Y + 4    If I'm to assume that you're supposed to add the terms, then your answer is Incorrect. :(    Y^2 + 5/(Y + 2) + 6Y + 3/(Y + 2)    To create a common denominator, we multiply both Y^2 & 6Y by (Y + 2)/(Y + 2). We get:    (Y^2)(Y + 2)/(Y + 2) + 6Y(Y + 2)/(Y + 2) + 8/(Y + 2)    Simplifying yields:    (Y^3 + 2Y^2)/(Y + 2) + 6Y^2 + 12Y/(Y + 2) + 8/(Y + 2)    Simplifying further yields:    (Y^3 + 8Y^2 + 12Y + 8)/(Y + 2)    The numerator cannot be factored or simplified any further, nor can it be divided evenly by the denominator.    If I'm to assume that you're supposed to solve for Y, then you've provided no solution. :(    To solve for Y, we first remove the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (Y + 2) (both sides so as to preserve its equality, of course, as I'm sure you well know. :) ). So we have:    (Y^2)(Y + 2) + 5(Y + 2)/(Y + 2) + (6Y)(Y + 2) + 3(Y + 2)/(Y + 2) = (Y + 4)(Y + 2)    Simplifying yields:    Y^3 + 2Y^2 + 5 + 6Y^2 + 12Y + 3 = Y^2 + 4Y + 2Y + 8    Simplifying further yields:    Y^3 + 8Y^2 + 12Y + 8 = Y^2 + 6Y + 8    Now we unite all the terms on one side of the equation, so as to be able to solve for Y. To that end, we subtract Y^2 + 6Y + 8 from both sides of the equation. We get:    Y^3 + 8Y^2 -- Y^2 + 12Y -- 6Y + 8 -- 8 = Y^2 -- Y^2 + 6Y -- 6Y + 8 -- 8    Simplifying yields:    Y^3 + 7Y^2 + 6Y = 0    Next, we factor out Y. We get:    Y(Y^2 + 7Y + 6) = 0    So, either    Y = 0    OR    Y^2 + 7Y + 6 = 0    To solve for Y, we need to factor it into a product of two brackets of expressions.    Generally, a quadratic equation of the format    aY^2 + bY + c    is factored into:    aY^2 + bY + c = (dY + e)(fY + g),    such that a = d*f, b = d*g + e*f, & c = e*g    In this case, we have a = 1, b = 7 & c = 6    There are two possible pairs of numbers that multiply to yield 6:    1*6 = 6 & 2*3 = 6    But, 2 & 3 are too small to add up to 7.    So the only workable pair are 1 & 6.    We can confirm this by:    (Y + 1)(Y + 6) =    Y^2 + 6Y + Y + 6 =    Y^2 + 7Y + 6    Thus we have:    Y^2 + 7Y + 6 = 0    (Y + 1)(Y + 6) = 0    So, either    Y + 1 = 0    To solve for Y, we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation. We get:    Y + 1 -- 1 = 0 -- 1    Simplifying yields:    Y = -- 1    OR    Y + 6 = 0    To solve for Y, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. We get:    Y + 6 -- 6 = 0 -- 6    Simplifying yields:    Y = -- 6    Therefore, Y = 0, -- 1, or -- 6.    6) (3X -- 8)/(X -- 2) -- (X -- 4)/(X -- 2) = 2 Correct. :)    7) 1/(P + 4) + [-- 2/(3P + 12)] = 1/3(P + 4) Correct. :)    8) 3X/(2X -- 10) + 3X/(6X -- 30) = 2X/(X -- 5) Correct. :)    9) (3 + Y)/(Y^2 -- 9) -- (Y -- 3)/(9 -- Y^2) = 0    Again, you've provided no solution. :(    (Y + 3)/(Y^2 -- 9) -- (Y -- 3)/(-- 1)(Y^2 -- 9) = 0    (Y + 3)/(Y^2 -- 9) + (Y -- 3)/(Y^2 -- 9) = 0    2Y/(Y^2 -- 9) = 0    Multiplying both sides by (Y^2 -- 9)/2 yields:    [2Y/(Y^2 -- 9)][(Y^2 -- 9)/2] = 0[(Y^2 -- 9)/2]    Simplifying yields:    Y = 0    Therefore, Y = 0.    10) (4X -- 1)/(X^2 -- 4) -- 3(X -- 1)/(X -- 2) = -- 3(X -- 1)/(X -- 2) Incorrect. :(    Generally speaking, an algebraic expression in the form of    P^2 -- Q^2    is factored as follows:    (P + Q)(P -- Q)    So we have:    (4X -- 1)/(X^2 -- 4) -- 3(X -- 1)/(X -- 2) =    (4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) -- (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) =    Next we create a common denominator by multiplying (3X -- 3) by (X + 2). We get:    (4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) -- (3X -- 3)(X + 2)/(X -- 2) =    Simplifying yields:    [4X -- 1 -- (3X^2 + 6X -- 3X -- 6)]/(X + 2)(X -- 2) =    Simplifying further yields:    [4X -- 1 -- (3X^2 + 3X -- 6)]/(X + 2)(X -- 2) =    Simplifying further still yields:    (5 + X -- 3X^2)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) OR (5 + X -- 3X^2)/(X^2 -- 4)    The numerator cannot be factored or simplified any further.    But, if it is the case that:    (4X -- 1)/(X^2 -- 4) -- 3(X -- 1)/(X -- 2) = -- 3(X -- 1)/(X -- 2)    & we're supposed to solve for X, then we have:    (4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) -- (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) = -- (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2)    First, we add (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) to both sides of the equation. We get:    (4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) + (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) -- (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) = (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2) -- (3X -- 3)/(X -- 2)    Simplifying yields:    (4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2) = 0    Next, we remove the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by (X + 2)(X -- 2). We get:    [(4X -- 1)/(X + 2)(X -- 2)][(X + 2)(X -- 2)]  = 0[(X + 2)(X -- 2)]    Simplifying yields:    4X -- 1 = 0    Now, to determine X, we need to isolate it. To that end, we add 1 to both sides of the equation. We get:    4X + 1 -- 1 = 0 + 1    Simplifying yields:    4X = 1    Finally, to solve for X,

Las bacterias al consumir residuos organicos producen metano como subproducto de su metabolismo, ese es el origen del metano de los desperdicios y excrementos.|`|rBmMVhgNaa	jajajaja  Asi sueles escribir siempre??? o te estas durmiendo en el teclado ??? Es  curioso tu mensaje.    El gas metano (gas natural) es un producto derivado de la descomposicin de la basura orgnica (alimentos, animales, plantas, etc). Ocurre que este gas, en lugar de dejarlo escapar a la atmsfera, se almacenan  a travs de sistemas confinados (cmaras), para luego transportarlo y aprovecharlo como combustible. A este combustible se le denomina biogas. El biogas se puede usar para cocinar, calentar el agua del boiler o bien , hablando de un proceso mas complejo, para generar energia elctrica, a travs de la transformacin de energia trmica a energa mecnica y finalmente a energia elctrica.  Esto es... el biogas se quema y el calor producido por esta combustin calienta un recipiente con agua, la cual a su vez se transforma en vapor a presin que se canaliza a travs de un ducto para golpear los labes de una turbina lo cual hace que sta se mueva a gran velocidad. La turbina a su vez tiene acoplado un generador elctrico que con el movimiento, como su nombre lo indica, genera electricidad, la cual es aprovechada por los usuarios finales como tu o como yo en la comodidad del hogar.  El biogas es una alternativa de energa que sin duda se ver en proyectos futuros. De modo que cuando veas un montn de basura, piensa en la cantidad de energia que eso podria generar.    Saludos.

To that end, we subtract 16 from both sides of the equation (both sides so as to preserve the equality, of course, as you undoubtedly know. :) ). We get:    5Y' + 16 -- 16 = 0 -- 16    Simplifying yields:    5Y' = -- 16    Finally, to solve for Y', we divide both sides of the equation by 5.

Small variations of the initial condition of a dynamical system may produce large variations in the long term behavior of the system. So this is sometimes presented as esoteric behavior, but can be exhibited by very simple systems: for example, a ball placed at the crest of a hill might roll into any of several valleys depending on slight differences in initial position.|`|oq8F1qfUaa	i thought you meant the movie..sorry.i dont know|`|JJu5w2hQaa	The concept of the butterfly effect is frequently referred to in popular culture in terms of the novelty of a minor change in circumstances causing a large change in outcome  The term is sometimes used in popular media dealing with the idea of time travel, usually inaccurately. Most time travel depictions simply fail to address butterfly effects. According to the actual theory, if history could be "changed" at all (so that one is not invoking something like the Novikov self-consistency principle which would ensure a fixed self-consistent timeline), the mere presence of the time travelers in the past would be enough to change short-term events (such as the weather) and would also have an unpredictable impact on the distant future. Therefore, no one who travels into the past could ever return to the same version of reality he or she had come from and could have therefore not been able to travel back in time in the first place, which would create a phenomenon known as time paradox.    It also relates to mathematical functions that are extremely sensitive to initial conditions. This is part of chaos theory. Benoit Mandelbrot is a mathematician who researched fractals.

The northern area which included the original empire was inhabited by nomads whose herds wandered the grassy areas.  They were renowned as great horsemen and breeders of strong animals...living off grasses.    In the area that is now western Iran, agriculture took place in the valleys of the mountainous region.    Agriculture consisted of wheat, barley. Also dates, figs, apricots, and honey in areas around rivers.      Parts of Parthia included the Fertile Crescent where figs, dates, and nuts were native but the trade routes brought seeds for apricots, peaches, plums, and apples and   possibly bananas.  They were grown in orchards.  Rice was grown in irrigated fields.    Because of its location between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf,  trade was the biggest part of the economy.

The sky is clear and transparent - just like it is at night when the moon and stars shine through it without being altered in their color.  The blue sky color is an optical illusion - just like a rainbow.    A rainbow isn't a real object although the colors you see are real.  You can make a rainbow with a garden hose and a sprinkler head and the Sun.  The rainbow looks like it is real and really there but when you turn the water off the rainbow goes away.      The reason the rainbow has colors is because the light going into a rain drop is refracted and then is totally internally reflected and then is refracted as it exits the drop.  The angle of refraction of the light is color dependent.  That produces the rainbow's colors.  Notice that the rainbow always appears opposite the Sun.  The Sun has to be at your back.    In a similar way the blue color of the sky is created all over the sky and it looks like there is a real blue sky but it goes away when the sun goes down.  The object we call the blue sky is an optical illusion.    The blue sky color is created when sunlight shines through the Earth's atmosphere during the day.  The atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen, argon and nitrogen gasses.  As sunlight shines through the atmospheric gasses some of the light is scattered in all directions by the very molecules of the gasses.  This scattering process, called Raleigh Scattering is very wavelength dependent.  Blue light is scattered in all directions about 10 times as much as red light is scattered and so we see mostly blue light coming from the direction of the sky.    The blue sky is light scattered from the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere The rainbow is created by refraction of light within a rain drop.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.     However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.     As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes.    http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blu|`|MI0MIAfaaa	Shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more easily by small particles in the air.  This means violet and blue light reaches your eye most easily.  But, your eye is less sensitive to violet light so you see mostly the blue light.    When light is scattered through a cloud, the particles are much larger and scatter all light just as easily, so instead of only seeing blue, you see the cloud as white.    Finally, when you look at a sunset, you are looking through much more atmosphere than you would if the sun was directly overhead.  By this time most of the violet and blue light has been scattered away, and only the red and orange light makes it through to your eye.|`|M3KKhk3Laa	here is a short and simple answer. the sky is blue because of the gaseous composition of the air in the atmosphere. When the sun shines on the earth, the gases in the atmosphere bends the light so it appears blue. this is also true because if you were on mars, the sky will appear red, because the gases on mars is different from that of earth. if you were on the moon and you look up in the sky, the sky will be black because their is no atmosphere on the moon    No light from the sun and you can see the stars in the night sky.     In reality the sky is actually black as the night sky.
muOCujc2aa	pines are evergreen. deciduous tree leaves fall during winter. pine needles last 2-3 years and fall off gradually as new growth emerges in the spring.|`|AA12272885	Pine needles are modified leaves.  Pine needles are adapted for life in cold climates which are also very dry because water is trapped as snow.  Needles have a thick layer of wax to prevent water loss, and the stomata are in crypts (depressions) so wind doesn't evaporate water.      The needles stay on the tree basically so that the tree can carry out photosynthesis early in the spring without using energy to produce leaves and wait until they mature.  This is necessary in climates with short cool growing seasons.|`|GJ92bcFDaa	The pine needles are not leaves. They are like the spikes on a cactus.|`|Ippd6MuPaa	They would look naked without their needles.  There is a tree like pine called Tamarack (Larch) that does drop its needles in the fall. Farther to the south there are trees that keep their leaves all year.  What it has to do with is the sap more than anything I think.  Pines all have resin cased saps  that don't actually freeze while the broadleaved trees almost all have water based sap that freezes.  This means that the leaves would be ruined by freezing if they didn't fall off.   So broadleaved trees go through the process of extracting everything useful from their leaves and storing it in their roots then let the leaves drop off.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Rain forests are forests with high amounts of rainfall, which cause them to have very different characteristics than other forests, such as coniferous forests. Rain forests are variably defined as having an average annual rainfall greater than 1750 mm and 2000 mm (68 inches to 78 inches). There are two types of  rain forest: temperate rain forests, which are found in small amounts on the coasts of all continents except Africa and Antarctica, and tropical  rain forests, such as the Amazonian rain forest in South America    The majority of the world's rain forests are located within 20 degrees of the equator, where it is warmest, and often, wettest|`|P9oduCUgaa	a forest that rains 24/7|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It is a jungle out there.|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Main Entry: rain forest   Function: noun   Date: 1903   1 : a tropical woodland with an annual rainfall of at least 100 inches (254 centimeters) and marked by lofty broad-leaved evergreen trees forming a continuous canopy called also tropical rain forest   2 : temperate rain forest|`|YRHLMfzDaa	Rainforests are forests characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 17502000 mm (68-78 inches|`|ndjVs0ELaa	Rain Forest, woodland characterized by lush vegetation and comparatively high temperature and rainfall throughout the year. Rain forests are the worlds most biologically diverse ecosystems. Although they account for less than 7 percent of the land surface on Earth, they contain more than 50 percentsome scientists estimate as high as 90 percentof its plant and animal species. One hectare (about 2.5 acres) of tropical rain forest may contain more than 600 species of trees. By comparison, the forests of the United States and Canada combined contain only around 700 tree species. Even more impressive are the number and diversity of animal species that call rain forests their home. One study found more species of ants living on a single rain forest stump than exist in all of the British Isles.    Rain forests also play a critical role in global climate regulation by absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas believed to be principally responsible for global warming. Plants naturally absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen gas in the process of photosynthesis, and tropical rain forests absorb more carbon dioxide than any other terrestrial ecosystem on earth. Global emissions of carbon dioxide have increased nearly 30 percent in the last century. There is general agreement among the scientific community that by absorbing some of the gas, rain forests play a vital role in lessening its impacts.     Tropical rain forests are located near the equator where the temperature hovers around 27 C (80 F) year-round. Although they cover less than 10 percent of the Earths surface, tropical rain forests provide habitat for 50 to 90 percent of the worlds plant and animal species.     The Amazon River is a meandering system of channels for much of its course through the South American rain forest. The river drains a vast region that nearly spans the continent, from its source in the Andes Mountains to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean. The river and its tributaries help support the largest rain forest of the world, an area encompassing half of the total global rain forest cover.     To be classified as a rain forest, a forest must have a closed canopy, in which the treetops, or crowns, touch each other, creating a shaded forest interior. In addition, temperature and rainfall must be high and relatively even throughout the year. Forests that meet these criteria are found flanking the equator in South and Central America, Asia, Africa, and Australia. In South America, a vast, forested area of the Amazon River basin in Brazil and neighboring countries is by far the largest rain forest in the world. It encompasses more than 3.5 million sq km (about 1.4 million sq mi)about half of the total global rain forest cover. The larger of two large rain forests in Asia is centered along the Malay Archipelago, including the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and the Republic of the Philippines. The other main rain forest in Asia is found primarily on the island of New Guinea and in northern Australia. In Africa, most of the rain forest is concentrated along the Atlantic coast and the Congo River Basin.    High rainfall and moderate temperatures in temperate coastal regions of the northern and southern hemispheres support small areas of temperate rain forests. Temperate rain forests, such as the Olympic National Rain Forest in Washington State, are dominated by only a few species of trees. This distinguishes temperate rain forests from their tropical counterparts, some of which contain as many as 700 different species of trees in a 1.2 -hectare (3-acre) area.         In regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, small areas of temperate rain forest are found along the coasts where rainfall and humidity are high and winters are mild. Such temperate rain forests are found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and southwestern Canada, for example. They are dominated by only a few tree species, however, making them differ dramatically from highly diverse tropical rain forests. This article focuses on tropical rain forests.|`|tQa7wo1taa	Rain forests are very damp, humid jungles found along the equator. These jungles have a variety of life. Monkeys, toucans, and lots of plants live in this climate. Rain forests are found in north-east Africa, all around South America, and i believe some in Asia. Also rain forests are being cut down for wood and farming land. This process is called deforestation.
MI0MIAfaaa	If the polar ice caps melted, then the sea level rise would be about 80 m. (due to both the melting and thermal expansion of the oceans).  Any land with an elevation above sea level less than 80 m would be flooded.      But, this isn't likely to happen by 2012.

Edrzhbrkaa	The crustal plates of the earth rest upon the Asthenosphere (Upper mantle), which is a layer of hot weak rock that is capable of gradual movement. Because of this gradual movement, the crustal plates are capable of movement as well.   Also, we know that density increases with depth, and since the crust is the "outermost" section of the earth, it is not very dense so it is more capable of movement.   There is Oceanic crust and Continental crust.   Note:  Continental crust is 30 - 80 km thick and has lower density  Oceanic crust is about 5 km thick and has higher density.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The Earth's rocky outer crust solidified billions of years ago, soon after the Earth formed. This crust is not a solid shell; it is broken up into huge, thick plates that drift atop the soft, underlying mantle.   The plates are made of rock and drift all over the globe; they move both horizontally (sideways) and vertically (up and down). Over long periods of time, the plates also change in size as their margins are added to, crushed together, or pushed back into the Earth's mantle. These plates are from 50 to 250 miles (80 to 400 km) thick.    PLATE TECTONICS  Type of Crust Average Thickness Average Age Major Component   Continental Crust 20-80 kilometers 3 billion years Granite   Oceanic Crust 10 kilometers Generally 70 to 100 million years old Basalt   The theory of plate tectonics (meaning "plate structure") was developed in the 1960's. This theory explains the movement of the Earth's plates (which has since been documented scientifically) and also explains the cause of earthquakes, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, mountain range formation, and many other geologic phenomenon.   The plates are moving at a speed that has been estimated at 1 to 10 cm per year. Most of the Earth's seismic activity (volcanoes and earthquakes) occurs at the plate boundaries as they interact.

Tan of Angle is 5.5/100 or 0.055.  Angle is 3.1481 degrees.  Travel along the grade is 112 ft.  Height is tan angle x 112 ft or 0.055 x 112 or 6.16 ft|`|JwPu0XbIaa	The 'percentage' of a grade is simply the vertical distance traveled, divided by the horizontal distance traveled.  So to answer the second part of your question, you'd have to know if you traveled 112 feet horizontally, or 112 feet on the diagonal distance.    If it was 112 feet horizontally, then your change in altitude is simply:  (112 feet) * (5.5/100) = 6.16 feet  because "percent" just means "per hundred" or, in other words, "divide by 100".    If it was 112 feet diagonally, then you have to do some algebra.  The Pythagorean theorem tells us that  a^2 + b^2 = c^2  where a and b are the short sides of a right triangle, and c is the long side (the hypotenuse).  If we let a be the horizontal distance, and b be the vertical distance, and c be the total distance traveled along the diagonal, then we know:  a^2 + b^2 = (112 feet)^2  And we also know:  b / a = 5.5% = 5.5/100 = 0.055  Solving these two equations simultaneously (by either substitution or matrix methods), we arrive at  a = 111.831 feet  b = 6.1507 feet  So we traveled 111.831 feet horizontally, and 6.1507 feet vertically.    Now we look at the formula for converting a percentage grade into a slope.  If G is the grade, and S is the slope in radians, then:  S = arctan(G)  or, written another way:  G = tan(S)  Since 5.5% = 0.055, G = 0.055.  Solving for S:  S = arctan(0.055)  S = 0.0549446  So, a 5.5% grade is an angle of 0.0549446 radians, measured from horizontal.  Simply multiply by (180/) to convert to degrees, and we see that the slope is 3.1481 degrees.
