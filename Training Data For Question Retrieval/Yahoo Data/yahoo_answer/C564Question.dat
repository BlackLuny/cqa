20090227151903AAUv2ow	Health;Mental Health	Soemthing strange happened to me yesterday? what could cause this?	i went to a job interview in the morning and as i was explaining things about my self in the middle of me talking i would uncontrollably say the prhase "she said". it was awkward because i was talking about myself and i never intended to say she said, nor was that a part of my train of thought. it would randomly come out right in the middle of me talking about something else, and it ws awkward because it was noticeable and by the person intervewing me. before the day of the interview i have been thinking intensely about things, and in my thoughts i will think about things i have said , but in the 3rd person, so in my thoughts i do often recount things i have said in the 3rd person. but why did this come out while talking out loud in a conversation, uncontrollably, it happened 3 times, and i was shocked but couldnt stop it from happening. i am in a depresssion research study so i am on an investigational medicine, but however its is a blind study so there is a 1/4 chance that i could be taking a placebo and not the medication. however would medication cause this? i havent felt a difference with my depression since starting the study.

Anyways I'm not much of a smoker but we wanted to check out some dispenaries just for the experience and to see what there like. Anyways a few questions. #1 will they allow us in without a medical marijuana card. And also a saw a documentary on tv and it said there are actually some places that allow marijuana to be used for recreational use. Is there anyway to buy from a dispensary without a medical marijuana card. I will also possibly be in the San Francisco area to one day. Im actually planning to move to California within 2 years to go to Berkley. Anyways thanks for your help, and if your some strong anti drug person please just don't answer.

I have not been very well lately and have had quite a few operations :( But when i woke up last night (my 1st night back home) i found a few things that worried me! Firstly when i was getting out of bed i noticed a mixture of blood and a strange yellow puss which i then noticed was all over my torso and was coming out of the cuts/incisions. Once i had cleaned it off they all continued to bleed and give out a puss! Also one of the cuts looks a bit open, Could a stitch have fallen out? Is this normal? should i just clean them/cover them and hope it will get better? Should i seek some medical advice? Are they infected? Is there anything else that i can do because i don't like hospitals? Did they do it right in the first place? and i can't get hold of my normal doctor! what should i do?      I am quite worried about it because the operations were quite serious so please don't leave anything stupid       Thanks

(I have told him to talk to his DR about this but he refuses). I just found another prescription written to him for VISTARIL? I looked it up online and it says can be used for anxiety? Im upset he has not told me about this medicine as he did not tell me about Vyvanse originally either. ( He says he doesn't wantme to worry).....These 3 medicines together-Vistaril, Lamictal and Vyvanse, is there cause to worry? I sometimes feel like Docs are so quick to just prescribe, prescribe without truly looking at what is best for the patient and their future....What is your opinion on this?????

Class 1 mild/moderately crowded openbitish malocclusion with slightly undersized upper laterals, a palatially malposed upper left cuspid, resorbed upper left lateral root and potential TMD.  I have a Impacted upper left permanent cuspid, upper left primary cuspid and upper left lateral incisor that is loose. My options...   Option A: Utilize full braces..Extraction of the upper right first bicuspid, the upper left primary cuspid, the upper left permanent cuspid and both lower second bicuspids.      Option B: Utilize lower fixed braces only.  extraction of the upper left primary cuspid, the upper left permanent cuspid and also the lower right central incisor. I would have to go an get an implant for the missing upper left cuspid and left upper lateral incisor because it is a guarded prognosis.      I am not exactly for sure what to do in this situation.  If I go with option A then I chance my upper left lateral incisor to fall out because of the resorbed root.      With option B I get implants.      I would call my orthodontist but they are closed today and I have all weekend to think about my decisions. This is driving me nuts!         Thanks for the input.

No symptoms of anything, but, just to make sure,  last month (9 months after the encounter) I had a full STD test.  They took blood and urine.  Everything came out negative and non-reactive.      The syphilis test showed this:      RPR, Rfx Qn RPR/Confirm TP-PA   Non Reactive      Now, I heard a rumor (can't always believe rumors) that she has syphilis.  I am not sure if this is true or not.      Should I be concerned about my non reactive (negative) results?

20090227152310AAPlCxe	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Could I possibly have the chicken pox?	Hello.   I have a quick question.      The other day I woke up and it appeared that I got some zits on my collarbone. I'm a teenage girl, so I figured that it was perfectly normal with our screwed up hormones. Unfortunately, today I got out of the shower this morning and saw that I had more all over my stomach, shoulders, and back. They are slightly itchy, but it is not that bad.      Could it possibly be chicken pox? At what point should I go to the doctor? What should I look out for?         Also, I got the vaccine when I was younger, but I did not get it a second time.

20090309135935AAJmEAv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Question about cancer : My dad discovered a suprarenal tumor 8 years ago.?	It was a big tumor.He had it surgically removed but remnants of the tumor remained of course.He started taking the medication Lysodren (mitotane).He is still on it as we speak.He also started taking glucocorticoids in order to compensate for the hormones released from the adrenal cortex which is now inactive due to the use of mitotane.Up till now the tumor is suppressed.About a year ago he discovered cancerous leukoplakia on his tongue.He had them surgically removed but they keep appearing and he keeps removing them surgically.So my question is : Is there a relation between the oral administration of mitotane and glucocorticoids and the appearance of oral cancer ? And what other methods of treatment other than surgical excision are available for small cancerous leukoplakia? Please this is very important for me.Thanks a lot

20090309145512AA3yhKx	Health;Mental Health	How do I stop thinking about looks all the time ?	I don't know why I do this maybe it'sbecause I was bullied by way I look .  I even had an operation on my lips because kids in my street made up an name fo rme which stuck to my whole family until I moved away from area .       I ve had few random comments like you 've been hit by ugly stick and have you looked in the mirror. My family and friends say am pretty but I know am not because you hear people talk about how pretty girls are and no ones ever said that about me .       I was sexually abused as a child but don't think that effects the way I look at myself more so in my self esteem. I guess I am quite negative I even dread when we book our wedding because I won't look like a pretty bride and I feel people will look at photos and say 'shame about her face' .       I just get so jealous of pretty girls and feel people look down on me because am not attractive. I am competive and tend to think girls feel they have one over on me because I am ugly.       My boyfriend says I always think about looks even when I am wtaching tv I'll think about how the actors look.    I thought everyone does it I just don't know how to stop . I am my own worst enemy I don't like having pictures with certain girls because it'll show how much pretty they are than me .       I work myself up so much and I just want to stop when my friends have chosen others over me I think it's because of way I look.       I feel my family aren't good looking and it's awful I feel ashamed saying it I really want to fix this .    Where do I start ?    I don't want to constantly think about looks I know it's who a person is that counts why do I keep doing this ?

I have 32% bodyfat, that's the only problem. I calculated it, it's like 70 pounds of my body is fat! Blubber Blubber! LOL Anyway, do soup diets work? I'm thinking about varieting it up with oat and whole grain cereals with 2% milk, every now and then tuna fish sandwiches, and a small portion of TGIFriday's honey BBQ wings for a good source of protein. Sound like a great idea. I love their BBQ wings, there ain't no alternative on that one. Don't even try to talk me into something in place of it. I love those wings, and that's my protein source.

20090309140354AA5wxmF	Health;Diet & Fitness	Exercising and being sick...?	I am an otherwise healthy male, I have been aggressively exercising for 60 days straight.  I am on the fitness program called P90X.  Last week, immediately after my cardio session, I felt my body literally go numb and ache like I was getting a cold chill to the bone.  That night I had shakes and fever and was very ill.  I literally slept for 3 days straight and I found out that I had actually caught the flu.  I was afraid that my body was crashing from over exercising or maybe a combination of catching the flu and my weakened immune system.  So, if I am feeling at about 60% better today, would it hurt to get back to my exercise routine or would that hinder my progress and hurt my performance?  Would it be better to wait a few more days or should I just go with it?  I read that after rest, exercise can actually jump start my immune system back up and help fight off the infection.

SO do you guys think this is a fracture??? i couldnt run last month but now i can run a mile!! (even though it hurts like 2 out of a scale of 10)

20090309141358AAvoZWy	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Accidentally washed husbands prescriptions, he will not call to get refill, what to do?	I apologize ahead of time for the long post as I believe it necessary to provide a little background detail.      My husband is a disabled veteran suffering from severe chronic chest and back pain.  He has been through pain management for about 6 years for various therapy's, drugs, treatments, etc.. and eventually ended up on Oxycontin the last 2-3 years.      Twice a day every day, he has 'never' taken more than he is supposed to and even keeps a database of what medications he takes on what days to keep track/history.      He accidentally left his prescription bottle in his jeans and it ended up getting washed with the laundry (we still have the washed bottle with some of the residue inside as proof).  His next appointment is not until the end of next week and he only has a few left that he keeps in a pill fob on his key chain.      He is too proud to call his doctor to tell him what happened fearing that he will be labeled as some drug addict.        His personality is the type that he would unnecessarily suffer rather than what he would call inconveniencing someone else (ie.. if he works late and misses the last train coming home, he'll walk 8-10 miles home even through bad neighborhoods and crappy weather instead of calling and waking me up to come pick him up)      He told me it doesn't matter in that even if he were to get another prescription the pharmacy/insurance wouldn't give it too him because it's still too early for a refill.      Because of the amount of the dosage (80mg x2), when he runs out, I am very worried about both his pain and the withdrawal.      I tried to tell him to just call, in the 5-6 years that he has been with this doctor and on some form of narcotic he has never had a problem.  He has legitimate pain and a legitimate use for the drug.  He has also passed every random drug test to test the level of opiates in his system to ensure he was taking what he was prescribed.      I don't know what to do, is he right? will they not give him a prescription to carry him over until his next appointment? does he have to suffer it out until the end of next week?

Yesterday i caught my bf using a personals site to talk to another girl. About six months ago we also broke up for a week because he lied to me about talking to his ex-girlfriend.   This morning i woke up to him throwing his clothes on me and belittling me. He has always done that, but today i got really angry and raised my fist to hit him. I don't know how but i stopped myself. After that i stood in front of the bedroom door yelling at him and wouldn't let him leave. The thing is that i'm not happy with him, he treats me horribly! Why do i still love him and think he will change? And why do i act like an abusive idiot? I don.t want to hit him... but when he is around me and treating me like crap, all i can think about is how much i want him to change his behavior because he should care that he is hurting me.

We have a 5 month old and he has had a bulging soft-spot(fontanel) for a week as of March 8, 2009. We took him to the er when we first noticed it and they did a full blood work up, a urine test, a cat scan, and a chest Xray. That all came back fine so they said that they would do a lumbar puncture(spinal tap) to rule out meningitis. That to came back fine, and they said to watch him. That it was a viral infection. We also called the Dr. a few days later because it was still bulging and he to said to keep watching him because he was a happy baby. Well here it is a week and a day later and its still bulged and sometimes still has a low fever. The bulge rises and falls and so does the fever. Personally we don't think its normal. After 3 other kids we have never seen a viral infection show this way. Any advice is helpful!!!!

20090309143329AAZCeZY	Health;Mental Health	Any paths out of this Escapist maze that I call my life?	don't cringe at the thought of a challenge but honestly fail most of the time. What is a guy like me to do with failure that I can't learn or improve from? I know it builds character, but sadly it could be nothing more. I live in a world that to me is just as unattainable as a fairy tale. Which is why I live in a dream-like movie heavy state of life. I do not much more with my weekends than either read a good book, or watch a good movie. My only friend I can really hang out with which I painfully regret is a woman older than my mom who has as many problems than me. There's no dignity at all in spending you life with a grandma figure. I just don't know if it is worth it to fight the struggle anymore. Should I accept mediocrity? Is there anything else in store for me? Because you don't know my struggle it may be hard to understand this question but in a quick description here are the struggles I face. I am not good at nearly any subject at school. I am physically incapable of playing almost every sport. Everything that takes a good brain I am uneligible for almost, I have horrible orginization, social skills, work speed, the list could go on. I am not being negative, this is the truth of my life. For me to succeed in life would take the patience of a saint. And if I accomplish anything it would be at a tremendously slow pace, and it may never happen what the hell was I put on earth for? I think I have the worst memory ever recorded in history.

20090309143928AAUPaF9	Health;Mental Health	Is it okay for a psych-nurse mother to recommend medication to her adult son?	I'm a 22 year old male.  My parents both work in psych and life with them has not been easy.  My Mom is the biggest problem.  She is a psych nurse and is obsessed with psych drugs.  I had two pet gerbils die and she tried to get me on Prozac (at age 7).  She finally found a doctor who would do it.  I had a seizure in reaction to the Prozac.      I grew up literally hating my parents because I couldn't ever just have a bad day.  Anything I did would be reported to a psychiatrist.  My Mom would already have a drug picked out before we got to the the appointment.  I finally cut them out, quit going to a psychiatrist, and my grades/social life went through the roof.      The other part of the equation is that my Mom believes that God grants her miracles.  So if I do well on a test in college, she never says "good work."  It's either "all my prayers must be working" or "the Effexor you are taking must be working."  My psychiatrist and I actually took me off SSRIs years ago but we both lie to her when she INSISTS on sitting in on sessions.      It's upsetting to me because she sits in the living room with me and diagnoses me, looks up drugs in her drug handbook, and orchestrates all these big treatment schemes.  The last straw came last week.  In a few days, my dog died, my best friend was diagnosed with a terminal disease, and my girlfriend left me.  To most people, that would be a pretty bad week.  I was pretty shook up, but I held it together and went through work/school fine.  I told my Mom about the things that had happened and she, like clockwork, went "you should try Seroquel to keep your agitation around this stuff in check."  I told my psychiatrist (who I only see to keep her happy) and he just shook his head.      I'm fed up because 1) she's not a doctor, 2) she cannot prescribe, and 3) all I want is to be able to talk to my Mom without being diagnosed.      It's amazing.  If I don't tell her stuff, I'm "shutting" her out and she moans about it.  If I do tell her stuff, she tries to push me into taking this drug or that drug.      I tell her about losing my girlfriend and rethinking things I could have done differently and I get the "that's awfulizing and OCD-driven thinking."  Then a drug suggestion will come.  Disagree and I get, "oh, you could be on anafranil and not be worrying about these things.  Go ahead, try yourself off meds and see how terrible you'll feel."      I see a psychologist each week and we just talk about life.  He also knows that I only go to make her happy.  It's ridiculous that I have to put up this treatment facade but it's better than constantly hearing about how I need it.  Simply put, if I'm not in therapy and on some kind of drug, she's not happy.      I should note that my older brother cut her out completely when she started pushing him to marry his then-girlfriend.  She quoted all these studies about dating duration and divorce.  They did get married but she has been at an arm's length ever since.

My mom was driving to the emegereny room with my dad home wathcing my brother and i had to hold to chin together..which i didnt really mind getting my brothers blood on my hand when he was in extreme pain. but my brother was yelling at me and i felt really bad. he didnt want me and was trying to get away from but i had to hold the cut and keep ice on it gently. anyway when he was getting stiches i came into the room and he was screamingggg when they were injecting him with the numbing stuff. i didnt see any blood whatso ever i wasnt even looking at them , i was trying to focus on the t.v. - (spongebob lol) and then all of a sudden my hearing felt wierd like i stopped hearing right and heard a faint long beep. Then i felt like i was going to throw up -all of a sudden. then i got realllly lightheaded. i said to my mom i felt sick and wanted too leave. then i just couldnt move casue i thought i was going to throw up then all of a sudden black came from all the coners of my eyes and i statred to sway then the doctor wsa like. oh no shes going to faint. then he ran and caught me before i hit the ground. then almost instantky i felt better after they layed me down and they gave me orange juicew. My face also turned really pale before i fell down. i dont know why i fainted. i didnt see any blood. im kinda afarid of needles. but not really. i think it had something to do with emotional stress.. my brother was screaming and i was trying to keep in tears. and i had a big fight with my friend the day before

20090309150433AAv7dFS	Health;Women's Health	Why did I have a miscarriage?	I'm a little confused. I'm 27 years old and this "was" my first pregnancy. I was told saturday that i'm having a miscarriage. The doctor's estimated that i was about 8-10 weeks pregnant, according to my hormone levels. I had some spotting a few weeks ago but was told it was normal. The doctor's suggested i have an ultrasound done. but to my surprise there was nothing there. NOTHING!! i thought i was just really early in my pregnancy. but another ultrasound saturday determined this was not a viable pregnancy. all we saw on the screen was the gestational sac. i've never heard of this happening. a fetus never developed, not one bit. why? the doctor's are waiting to see if i just pass the sac on my own, but nothing yet. barely any cramping or blood. why or how did such a thing happen?

Hi,      I've had OCD-like symptoms for several years (i'm currently 18, people noticed them when i was around 13)... these including nothing major but simple things like turning on/off  light switches, repeating songs, doing certain stretches, counting, sitting/ stand rituals, and other daily tasks until i feel comfortable with them... usually at 12 or an even number divisible by four.      I know most if not all people have similar habits that resemble very minor OCD but it seems as though i'm spending much more time doing rituals in the past weeks... it's gotten up to 1 to 3 hours a day.

I wasn't very happy with it.   I was really pleased to get 79% the next time because that's a big leap up the scale.   76% is okay....but why am I not thrilled?   I tried as hard as I could: these aren't bad marks.   Yet still I feel I should have done better.      I am not a perfectionist in any area of my life...it's just that I want to achieve academically.   My father (who was never there for me growing up and who has run off with a young wife) always prided himself on his own education and how many clever books he read.   He was not interested in me or my achievements so much as me being amazed at his own.      So part of me suspects that by so strongly wanting to succeed academically I am only really looking for the acceptance that never was mine for simply being me.   Do you think this makes sense?   But I do think I am clever...and should get better marks than I do.   I am trying so hard.      I don't talk about these feelings with others because most people think I've got my life sorted.   It would seem mean for me to express my disatisfaction with getting marks I know some of them would really struggle for.   There is a sense of desperation and lonliness in me.      Well, it is kind of helpful to want to do well in my education - it means I will hopefully have a good career some day.   However, I would love to just be happy with the grades I earn and not to measure myself according to percentages.         Thanks for reading.

20090309161121AAUqKyj	Health;Dental	Abscess vs. Canker sore?	So, on Friday, I noticed a bump on the side of my jaw closest to my back tooth. When I pressed on it, it didn't hurt - however, when I pressed really hard it began to hurt (no surprise since I probably put too much pressure for any gum not to hurt). The only time the tooth hurts is when I get a slight pain when I chew or close my mouth hard-hard.       I've heard of people getting canker sores on their gums, and I think this might be the case. I've heard an abscessed tooth is very painful, but I've felt no pain whatsoever. The tooth that is closest to the swelling used to have a cavity; however, that tooth has been fully cleaned of any decay and taken care of.      Could this be a canker sore, or just the beginning of an abscess? Is there a way to tell a difference between a canker sore and a beginning abscess?      Thanks so much

It wore me down mentally - we broke up a few months ago and I feel like a grey cloud has been lifted. The only problem is I have paranoia that doesnt seem to go away. I have met a new guy who is great he is so nice to me and we are getting to know each other and taking things slow. I cant help but feel totally paranoid, I feel like he is too good for me (even though I am not a failure), that he finds any woman around me attractive, that he thinks I am boring, he thinks im ugly - the list of my delusions are endless. I hate feeling this way and it is a completely wrong! He is being so nice to me but I still feel things will go wrong and he will dump me or cheat and even like I dont deserve him as he is attractive and a nice person. Today was the icing on the cake when I met him with my best friend (who is good looking) and they were talking and generally just being friendly and I couldnt help but feel jealous and thoughts of "I bet he fancies her" were going through my head. This is driving me insane and I will drive him away if I dont stop it - I do not tell him how I feel as I dont want him thinking I am needy or attention seeking. I am 23 btw he is 28.

20090309160410AAMmiPq	Health;Women's Health	Was it implantation bleeding or just a light period, mirena?	My period was a week late(but thats not unusual for me). When it started, Feb 25, it was just light pink when I wiped and it stayed like this for 3 days. Really never needed a pantyliner, as it was just when I wiped and just light pink. About 5 days after it stopped, I started cramping, getting gas, and diarrhea. I've been slightly light-headed at times. Also having dreams about water. Tested today, negative. Okay, so I am using Mirena birth control... so the odds are really against me getting pregnant. And the claim is that mirena can make you have shorter, lighter periods or none at all. But I have had it for almost 2 years and always had medium flow periods for 5-7 days. So does this sound like implantation, or just a light period?

At times I slip into a state of mind where I don’t feel like myself. It’s not like I feel like another person, just that I don’t feel as though I’m fully connected. I’ve read forums, articles, etc. about this disorder and people say that it goes away. That part is kind of true. If I don’t concentrate on it, then it does. But I still feel slightly disconnected. I also have poor memory and have sensitivity to light. Also, the episodes don’t happen when I’m stressed and I didn’t suffer from a poor child hood. I miss the days when I was myself and not afraid that if I do something I might slip into another episode. Can someone help?

20090309160846AACeMFV	Health;Mental Health	Help?!?! What can I do to calm myself down?	I just stopped cutting about a week and a half ago. I was pretending like nothing was wrong. When it got to be too much to keep a secret, I told my closest friend, Holly, and made her promise not to tell anyone. She didn’t and I was glad at the time. Once I told her, it became easier to explain to my other close friends, Stacy, Kellie, and Taylor, what was going on. They all prayed for me and kept my secret.    Later, talking to them wasn’t helping the way it had before. I tried talking to other friends, one’s I didn’t normally tell these kinds of things, like Catherine and Megan, but, it still didn’t help me. I knew the only way to get out was to tell my parents. I don’t trust my parents that easily, so I refused. Just this past Wednesday, my youth pastor found out somehow and called my parents. I was upset, but at the same time relived that I didn’t have this secret weighing me down anymore. The next night, my parents sat me down and asked me, “What goes through your mind when you cut?” I hate word cut or cutting, so I buried my head in the couch and didn’t answer. My mom came over, sat behind me, and started to rub my back. I told her; “I don’t want to talk about it.” this happened over and over again. I finally realized that I had to open up or it was going to go nowhere. So I cried and cried and cried. And the whole reason I was upset was because we were talking about my sister. We don’t have the best relationship, and it hurts me a lot. I want a sister who is my best friend. So I cried, we talked, and they took me out to dinner.    My problem is, I have to meet with my youth pastor, I think tomorrow, to talk and I’m terrified. I really don’t want to talk about it. I’m not going to let it happen again, but no one believes me anymore. What can I do?
20090309160939AA8HkQK	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Should he go back to the doctor?	My 4 year old is coughing a deep chest cough once again. I feel like my child is sick 24/7. He had his adenoids taken out and tubes put in his ears right before christmas.He has very bad asthma, but I dont think my child should live on his breathing machine. Now he has been coughing for around two weeks now, and it seems like it getting worse. He is having coughing spells, where it seems like no matter how hard he coughs, he is not able to get it all up. He has off and on light fevers, nowhere near like I have seen him have. So if anyone has any advice on what to do, I would love that. I am going to make an appointment with the doctor tomorrow, because I dont know what else to do.

20090309165824AAcGxuO	Health;Mental Health	What conclusions would u make?	There's a young woman at work who is incredibly shy. Yet she's worked with you for a few years. She has a history of bad asthma and got sick yesterday, almost taking the day off. She emailed you her work plans just in case she wasn't in. But she came in anyway.  So you checked up on her and asked her what triggered her attacks. She mentioned the weather changes, her period, being near cigarette smoke and having a few glasses of wine the other day, which all set it off.  She was soft-spoken, but seemed pretty open.  However, a few other coworkers overheard, then asked her if she was talking about her asthma. She turned and kind of innocently nodded but said nothing else.  They all gave her a sympathetic look. Unsure of what to say, she just lowered her gaze and avoided eye contact with everyone.      What conclusions would you make about her reactions and behavior?

20090309134940AAugJlh	Health;Mental Health	I now understand why people take drugs, but should i too?	lately i've been feeling a bit low. my friends ignored me, my friends' friends began to carry them away from me, and now i'm left neglected amoung my friends and left alone for myself. all the while their friends are making fun of me.      just a few nights ago i've been thinking about magic mushrooms. i wanted to know what they were, and if they were really a mushroom. and i figured out a lot of things about the magic mushroom. that they have some chemcials in them that makes you hallucinate, that some of the hallucinating mushrooms are perfectly safe to eat, but the most important information i got of all was that they used it for testing. and whats more important than the testing was the result. apparently they've used these mushrooms on 40 voleenteers and watched them for a few hours after they've consumed the mushrooms. afterwards they asked what they've seen, and most of them, since nearly all of them were religious, said that they saw Christ and had a very religious experience which enlightened them thouroughly.       and afterwards, other people tried it and 90% of the time they've grown happier. they've grown happier. thats the most important piece of all. they've grown happier. its better than anti depressants they say and that it doesnt harm your body, except for the fact that you might start trippin a few years later or so, but usually the affects of the mushroom wears off in a few months.       i want these mushrooms. i know they arent drugs, they were considered illegal in the US only because they were not medically related and they were afraid that people might start to eat these mushrooms and then start driving around. infact, some hospitals pursuaded the US gov to allow magic mushrooms to be used on some cases of depressed beings. if its not unhealthy for my body, and it would make me happy, shouldnt i be able to eat some of these?      i now understand why people take drugs. they're sad, and then afterwards addicted. they've probably gone through a phase of suicidal, but were too whimpy to try it out. thats me. i was thinking of suicide, my parents were negletcting me, my siblings all torment me, my friends shouldnt even be considered friends anymore, and there isnt a caring soul on the planet that would do something to make me feel better. going off the face of the earth would defiantly release all of my problems here on the earth. i'd be elsewhere, not even caring about earth or problems. but then again, since i'm slightly religious i would do such a thing since i've been thinking of hell too. and i was too whimpy to even hang myself or jump off a building or cut out my windpipe. drugs, they shouldnt even be called drugs, is a road thats there. these are natural drugs, you dont light them on fire or sniff them up, which is unnatural to digest things with our noses. smoking is bad, i know that. but eating mushrooms? we do that with normal mushrooms. i would just eat the mushrooms like normally and soon i'd be happy, right? its a safer and better way out of my problems than suicide. i wonder, should i do it too?      and you ask, how would i get these mushrooms? well one simple answer is this: take a trip to the UK. apparently they grow freely there so i could just go out into the field when its dawn and mostly everyone is asleep, pluck a few, and take them home with me. i could even grow thses mushrooms at my house. perhaps thats a little too irresponsible, but i just want one taste of it, just a small nibble. i want to be happy, thats understandable right? everyone wants happieness. and this mushroom has been proven to enlighten people, make people feel better. its pretty rational, right? taking "drugs" aka edible mushrooms just like the ones bought in stores.

20090309173804AAb3lCh	Health;Diet & Fitness	Tomorrow I have to go to the doctor's and I'm scared?	I'm 16 yrs old and a female and my mom set up a doctors appt for me for...tomorrow! Needless to say, im dreading it like most people, but more than i usually do. It's because I might possibly have lost weight since my last visit (in December i think b/c i had to get shots...yuck!) and my mom is a little concerned because I havent gotten my period yet (I'm around 85 lbs and 5'1). The reason im worried is because I really really REALLY dont want to gain any weight, I think I'm fine how I am and im scared the doctor will put me on some kind of hormone thing to help me start my period and make me gain weight. I really dont think Im that skinny though others do. I DO want to start my period and have kids someday, but I know girls at my school who are around my size and they have gotten their periods (they talk about PMS and tampons and stuff lol) so I dont think Im too thin to have it. What can I do?
20090309164347AAMUPdK	Health;Mental Health	I feel like I am overwhelmed with emotion?	I'm a 23 year old girl and I was hoping for some useful advice for my situation. Over the past few years, I have been under alot of stress to get into medical school. I'm in graduate school at the moment. I try my best everyday to ignore feelings of anxiety and toughen-up, but I have alot of bottled up feelings inside and its becomes intolerable some days.   I feel emotionally worn as a person - I'm used to delayed gratification, but with increased awareness of romantic relationships around me and what guys are attracted to in terms of looks, somedays I honestly cannot help but cry. In high school, it wasn't an issue because I knew that I would have a better life if I worked hard. Now I feel extreamly conflicted because I am around many successful individuals who have boyfriends and look as though they are very satisfied with who they are. I'm 23 and I've never had a bf or a date.   I'm just concerned - am I terribly unattractive or is there something else that I am not aware of? I believe I have a good heart - I work at a hospital for sick children and I am very hopeful for the world. I want to make a difference in the world and I encourage my close friends and peers.   I feel like there is all this emotion boiling up inside me on a daily basis but I just pretend that it doesn't bother me...I wish I could just be a more carefree person but the truth is that I care so much about my studies that I am willing to put so much on hold in my life, most often including my happiness.      What is happening?

20090309164507AAoGiB4	Health;Mental Health	Social phobia and social anxiety.. are they different?	Well I am really, really shy and its because of my past experiences as a child. I was bullied everyday from the ages of 6 and up to about the age of 16. I am 23 now. And now I avoid people as much as I can. I don't go downstairs to meet relatives if I can avoid them. And in my late teens I would hide in my cupboard so my mum wouldn't make me meet them. I know thats strange.      I have to practically force myself to go to work. If it was up to me I would be at home 24/7 even though I don't want to be. I want to socialise but can't. I don't know if I suffer from panic attacks anymore but I am stuck with my way of thinking. I always worry what people think of me and I am afraid to try new things. I am shy and quiet as well.      Long periods of social interaction make me really uncomfortable, depressed and I just want to get out of there and go home because my mind gets really tired of being paranoid.

20090309174754AAqGiCc	Health;Women's Health	Birth control + period lateness?	I would prefer that women/teens who have used the birth control pill answer my question, as I'm interested in their experience. I've already done some research, so anything you come up with on google I'll likely have already read (:      I started taking birth control in November (I'm on Sprintec, a generic ortho cyclen) both because I was ready to start having sex with my boyfriend and to regulate my period. In the four years before starting on BC, I'd only had my period about 8 times. My first period while on the pill was alarmingly heavy and lasted 2 1/2 weeks. After that, my periods in December and January were normal and had predictable start dates.      In both Dec and Jan I started on Saturday after taking the last regular pill in the pack. Then in February it was two days late... I started on Monday afternoon.      Well, it's March and so far I'm 3 days late since I haven't seen it today. I've had cramps for the past four days and bloating, typical signs of my period... but no blood.      It is possible, but unlikely that I am pregnant. My boyfriend and I just recently started having sex. He has never finished inside of me, and most of the time we use condoms so that wouldn't matter anyway.       What I'm wondering is... could my period just be shortening? I've heard that happens with the pill, but I'm not sure. The first two "regular" periods I had on the pill were 7 days exactly. Last month was 5. So what gives? Any thoughts?       Thank you.

But at the same time I kind of knew it wasn't really there. But I couldn't control what I was thinking. Then I started to think, "She's dead... she's dead above me. Her blood is dripping on me... My God, she's dead.." but I still didn't move. I don't know who "she" is or anything. My mind kind of went from knowing it was a hallucination to thinking it's really there.

And it's impossible to truly connect with anyone with just words and actions.    I also sometimes feel like nothing else exists, and I don't exist, and it's just empty space, and I can't even explain why...    And then sometimes I feel like everything is in slow motion, and everything goes blurry and I just need to sit down, you know? I can't comprehend anything anyone is saying.    Then, last night, for some reason, I felt like something was dripping constantly on me... like I remember thinking clearly in my mind, "it's blood... blood that's dripping on me." but at the same time I just knew it wasn't real... ugh. I can't explain it. It was like my mind was thinking on it's own.      I will go see someone, but I just want to know what you guys think. Thanks..

For the past 3-4 months i have been having chest pains. they are always in the same spot, which is underneath/behind my left breast, towards the center of my chest. so i am assuming that the pains are coming from my heart.      i thought it could be pleurisy, but everything i found online says that pleurisy goes away on its own, and within a few weeks.       the pain randomly comes, no matter what i'm doing. i do not think it is associated with strenuous activity or exercise, or breathing, eating, etc. it just comes randomly.      it is almost like a sharp, piercing pain. my chest feels tight but only in that area. it sort of comes in pulses that last about 3-5 seconds each.      it happens virtually every day and can last anywhere from 1-30 minutes.       my friend told me it sounds like anxiety attacks that she used to have, but the pains come even when i have no reason to be anxious or nervous...      should i go to the doctor? what could this be?

Also, please do not tell me to shut up because I'm a normal weight,blahblah, honestly.   Because if you know anything about having children,you would know that your body is basically destroyed afterwards, muscle-wise,so even though I'm average weight, all the weight I want to lose is basically all flab.So if you are going to be destructive and not pleasantly CONstructive then please shut your face =)

20090309134538AAt5mFv	Health;Mental Health	My drinks been spiked?	I am pretty sure my drink was spiked on Saturday night around 2am. I was at a rave, and this really weird guy kept giving me stuff. He carried a water bottle on his head the ENTIRE night. During the night, he gave me 2 glow sticks. He was an asian male about 40, so already i was kind of suspicious as we were in the small room where no one over 25 was there. He didnt talk AT ALL, and he kept dancing into our group. Okay, to where my drink was spiked : He reached his hand over to my water bottle, and gave it to him, he then opened the bottle, smiled, and closed it. Like i didnt even think how suspicious that was until the night ended. He put the water bottle on his head, and danced with it for a while. And gave it back, i continued drinking.   Also, alot of other people kept asking for a drink of my water, and i was really suspicious about these 2 girls that kept asking for my water. They tried to sell the people beside me FAKE caps. You can't press pure MDMA, and they were caps and they kept urging the girls to take it. I think each time those 2 girls asked for my water, they opened the lid and slipped stuff in.      I know this question is long, and a bore to read, but i thought those details may help answer my question.      Note: Each time im assuming it got spiked, it was always a new batch of water, because i kept refilling it in the washroom lol. I was the main person drinking, but each of my friends probably had 2-4 sips each,      For the question :    (keep in mind i was also on 3 caps & blazed) I had the basic results of caps, but my heart was beating extremely fast.    I was getting EXTREMELY paranoid. I thought i could hear what people were saying when they were in the middle of the dance floor. I kept hearing my name,and everyone was talking about me. and i lost sense of where i was, like i knew i was at the rave, but the rooms in my mind were just totally messed up.        I was talking, and NOBODY could understand me and i swear i was making perfect sense to myself. I kept thinking everything was a joke, like the cops took out all the phone signals outside to not let us go home. there was a hallway that i thought they were trying to trap us all in, and i kept asking "Is this all a joke" and nobody knew what i was talking about. And I heard people talk about the weirdest things, that just couldnt be real. I dont remember what they were saying really, but it was crazy stuff , ex: " my pink elephant was eating my aligators food."      What was i spiked with ? And how long will it be in my system for ?   I want to go to the health clinic tomorrow and check.

Ok so I was in athletics and we were using these blue boxes and were stacking them on top of each other and jumping over them like hurdles and if you did not want to you could leap frog over them so I leap frogged over the last one and my hands went underneath my body and I totally face planted and banged up my knee. I cannot move it and I feel LOTS of liquidy stuff in my knee and I cannot even step on or off my bus and I'm so afraid to go to school because I don't want to be late, and I don't want to do anything in athletics and my mom said maybe TOMORROW AFTER my school I may go to the doc but that is to late. So what is the easiest way to heal my knee quickly and go on with my life. And how do I survive school tomorrow when I go as slow as a snail and it also takes me like 10 minutes to go across my kitchen floor.

Okay, so I have posted this question before, but i have to post it again for more answers and i will tell you details, that may better help you decide.      Alright, so HI, i am a girl 13 years old, but i am turning 14 in about 3 months. I got a cell phone in grade 6 and two days later i had a terrible migraine, i convinced my mom to take me to the doctor and they said i had a migraine(it lasted 7 whole days!) they said i would get them because my mom has migraines every 6 months that are so bad she cant get out of bed.      So i played with my new phone, talking while charging, texting talking a lot, until i found out that ou they can give you brain cancer, i stopped immediately using my home portable phone for hours. Till today even! So anyways about 6 months ago even longer i cannot remember i started seeing stars randomly, like one or 2 of them coming in bright colours not disrupting me but enough to make me scared. I also started getting weird pains in my head, like okay well, do this:      touch the back of your head in the centre, then move your fingers 2 inches to the right, 2 inches up and 1 inch to the left. there, well about there i get thiss pain like a vain or something going deep in there sort of attatched to me eye pull, or feelslike stuff is going there, its weird, throbs for 30 seconds goes away and sometimes comes back. This happened for weeks, then all of the symptoms stopped. Then some time later they started and stopped, all over again. Npw this pain comes rarely , comes like 3 times in a day hurts and stops, and again a few days or wekks, or months later! Its so weird! (sometimes i get ringing or high pitched squeals in my right ear as well but that goes away too, my friend says she gets is also .) i twitch a lot sometimes, in my veins or muscles but doesnt everybody now and again? I told my mo this i told her i might have brain cancer, she said i don't, she said if i did i would have bad headaches, seizures and stuff, and tumoors are rare in kids. I said wha if im different? and she said if i had this for months now and they didnt get worse( stopping actually or decreasing) i probably dont. I told my doctor this all my twitches and weird pains and he said that if i get this anf the pani lasts for only a few seconds and goes away coming casually we dont worry about it. i am a hypochondriac and my mom is sick of hearing such outbursts, so im scared.         You know what, today i faked a big headache, i think ill do this till she gets me an MRI ..She said if i dont have symptoms they wont take me in , they will but in tso long because ppl need MRI's..So what do you think?         ( did have an eating disorder and ate unhealhy as a lack of exersice, and stay on the computer for housr, but when i bettered myself they came, not often but still...i also drink very little water..)      and see, today it hapened like 5 times, mild to extreme, its lasts little its weird..i get a lot of headaches but im often on the computer they go after tha i mtrying to stay off:P      so people survive brain cancer?

Last week or so i have had a sharp stinging pain that originated just below my ribcage on my left side below the heart.  It has spread to effect my back in the same general area and traveled up to also cause pain in my left armpit and cause a pain sometimes near my right elbow.  Pain has also occurred just above where the femur attaches to my hip.  Sometimes pain is felt on right side in front and back parallel to the left hand side.  Its not pleurisy because i can take a full deep breath and let it out slowly without pain.  Sometimes the pain is felt when i sit up suddenly.  Any ideas what this could be.

20090309165026AAuqnRs	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Do you have any idea what these symptoms mean?	It's a sharp, stabbing anal pain that also occurs, often simultaneously, in the vaginal area. The 'attacks' last for several minutes and sometimes the area aches afterwards. I also have occasional pain in my hips, not the joint but the fleshy area just next to it. I already know I have a bladder infection. Is this just an advanced stage or is it something else entirely?
20090309144033AAaYEhL	Health;Diet & Fitness	How Can I Lose Weight? (Really Let Myself Go)?	Hi everyone.   Over the past 4/5 years I have gained around 10 kgs (20 lbs). I have let myself go over the years. I used to love going to the gym and maintained a healthy diet, whilst still enjoying the occasional treat. I just became lazy one day and lost all will and overindulged in food and stopped exercising. I carry a lot of wait on my stomach and have quite big love handles.      I know the way to lose weight is to eat less (and healthily) and move more, but I can't seem to find the motivation to get back into my own ways. I went to the gym about a week ago and was so discouraged by how low my fitness has become. Can someone please give me some guidelines on how to get back on track with healthy eating and exercising again? (I haven't exercised in a while, so please recommend something to ease getting back into a routine). Also, I am a university student and on a budget, so healthy cheap meal ideas would be great. It's such a pain having to go back to the supermarket to get fresh veggies!!      Thanks so much for your time and help everyone....I am determinded to lose these 10 kgs (20 lbs)!!

20090309114934AAVuZGQ	Health;Mental Health	I have a referral to a psychiatrist, but i'm not sure i need it?	i have been having severe and frequent panic attacks since about november (before christmas as many as 4/5 per week), and i have also been finding it almost impossible to regulate my mood. this has been mostly very low and depressive, with some suicidal thoughts, but i have also had some weird uncontrolled highs which have (afterwards) scared me a little. for these four months i have been really confused and unable to think properly, whether it be due to low mood, high mood, or panic.    my school work has completely suffered (i am in my a-level year) and my teachers made me go to a psychologist, but this didn't help, so i told her i was better and have stopped going. she just made me angry.    my teachers then suggested i went to the doctor, which i did - and i now have a referral to a psychiatrist.    however...   about two weeks ago all the mood problems and depression stopped really suddenly and my head has been fairly clear. i really don't think there is anything properly wrong with me that would justify going to my appointment, and i feel like i would be wasting their time.    i have had a couple of 'episodes' similar to this, but not as bad, a few times before, and they have always cleared up in a similar way.    i think everything has got out of hand and blown out of proportion, and now the only thing that is making me anxious is the appointment.    should i go? and what happens? my parents don't know at all   sorry if this is a stupid question.

In other words, I eat like a boy basketball player during basketball season! LOL! Prom is coming up and I need to lose weight in less than one month.        Most of my fat is in the stomach area, like where my belly is! I try to control my eating portions but like I said, I can't! I eat cereal everyday for breakfast. For lunch, I have half an individual package of ritz low fat crackers, and for dinner, it depends. I usually have ramen noodles with a salad with that 2 calorie spray ranch stuff, or baker spaghetti or something like that. And some times, I have snacks like, amish bread, apples, a very small cup of cocoa, or ice cream(if we have any)        I don't exercise everyday, but I have volleyball practice two times on tuesday, and one game on Saturdays.        What can I do to lose weight! My doctor says I have to lose 15 pounds. Yea, I am a girl, but I am NOT fat, in fact, everybody thinks I am a size small.          Thanks!

Is this an effective workout to gain good muscle mass by the summer?  Why or why not?  If not, can you direct me to a routine that will be able to build good muscle fairly fast.

Correlate with clinical findings.      ** IMPRESSION **:   Fracture vs bipartite lateral 1st MT head sesamoid. Correlate   Clinically

My cousin who is a personal trainer suggested that i do this "Detox Diet" prior to starting workout sessions with him. He says that i need to eat Tomato Soup for four days, so that my body will be cleansed and i will lose some weight prior to working out with him. How valid is this? Does anyone have any opinions?
20090309181312AA7XhOP	Health;Other - Health	I have a slanted nose, and possibly a deviated septum. Do I need septoplasty?	Slanted, crooked, whatever. I don't know what it is, something isn't right. I think I have a deviated septum. Ever since I was about 2, I thought I had really "bad allergies." But I've noticed that it's not seasonal. Yeah, it gets a little better when I go somewhere humid, but some of the same problems keep happening.      1. I can only breathe through one nostril at a time. No joke. I've lived all of my life this way. I can only breathe through one right now, as I am typing this.      2. I am a heavy breather. When I sleep, my breathing is LOUD! I don't snore, unless my nose is stuffed. <---- My friends told me about this one.      I know it's only going to get worse. People have always told me that I look a lot like my dad. He get a sinus infection every other month! As I get older, my face is only going to look more and more like his (and my mom's too, I guess), and I'll have the same problem! Basically, I think my dad has a deviated septum, too.      By the way, I'm only 14 (female), my mom would NEVER let me get surgery at my age (unless I somehow convince her, and she finds it a priority), and I DO know that it is not good to get a surgery like this at my age. If I did get septoplasty, I'd have to be at or over 18 years old... Only 4 more years...      Are there any other ways to (test/find out) if I will need sectoplasty without going to a doctor? My allergy doctor keeps trying to get me to take stuff like Nasonex, Ayr, Veramyst, and it never helped, and probably because it got stuck in my nose! I also take Zyrtec, but that takes care of all of my allergies, not just my nose.       They would never believe me without enough evidence that this is the problem.      Thanks, in advance, for your answers.      ------------------PS------------------   If you're wondering, yes, part of this is cosmetic. I never knew my nose was crooked until a few months ago, from looking at myself too much. You know that whole double mirror thing? I've tried using bronzer on my nose to make it appear straighter... And it only looks good under the lighting in my bathroom, not so much under the fluorescent lights at school. If you know anything about how I can survive in the meantime, help is appreciated! =)      For the record, I like the shape of my nose. It's me. My profile looks normal. No bump, no unwanted cartilage. The only thing that bothers me is that it's slanted. Would septoplasty STRAIGHTEN AND CENTER my nose? MY nose? I understand that it may not for most noses.  Thanks again. Tell me if pictures would help. I'd prefer to not put up pictures.

20090309181504AAE8XEv	Health;Dental	Should I get my wisdom teeth looked at/removed?	For the past two weeks I've had a horrible pain in my jaw just below my right ear, and now I'm noticing that my hearing seems to be fading a little in that ear too. My mum said it could just be a build up of wax or something, but my boyfriend said it could also possibly be my wisdom teeth causing problems. I'm almost 19 so there is a chance it could be wisdom teeth, but I really have no clue. Help?

The vet said he also had a heart murmur and I need a scan to decide if he can take the operation.  It all costs so much and I am living on SS.  What is the answer.  Are all vets this expensive?
20090309181738AAKEeQl	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can I use GNC Wheybolic Extrememe 60 for weight-loss?	I spoke to the guy at GNC and explained that I needed to lose weight (I was diagnosed with Celiac disease and I'm having a hard time losing weight with all of the gluten free food I have to eat).  The guy said to only use one scoop (as opposed to the 3 recommended serving) which would have 90 calories and 0.33 grams of fat, 2 carbs and 20 grams of protein.  Using this as breakfast and maybe after the gym, will this help me with weightloss or will I pack it on?  I'm not sure exactly what the rest of the stuff in there will do to me.  I've used a different whey product for weight loss and that helped.  If anyone has any info to help me, I'd really appreciate it!!

20090227095823AAEzg6n	Health;Dental	I had a root canal a year ago when a lower mollar was bothering me. After the procedure the intedontist and?	his staff tell me that I have to go find another kind of dental office to get a cap which will run me about $1000 and that my insurance coverage only had about $60 left to cover it. Now a year later and not working and no insurance my hollow mollar is causing severe migraines. My mom tells me yesterday that after her 6 root canals she know they were supposed to insert a metal post weather they were supposed to tell me about the cap or not there should be some metal post in my mouth not just a hollow tooth. I'm mad. What can I do, anything?
