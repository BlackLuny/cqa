It could just be those people are thinking of that.     It could also be those people would rather have potentially interesting company.  I've met a number of interesting people on transit.  If you're a young and/or cute girl and they're guys, that may well be it.     Try sitting on the "aisle" seat instead of the window seat, and that will help deter that, because people will sit elsewhere rather than go "pardon me" to get over you to get to the empty seat.  Of course, it will be viewed as selfish by those looking for a seat.|`|e4fUoOpmaa	I would sit by myself.  I don't like to be crowded up.

mR5ZtjqWaa	I know one friend currently employed as ATC (tower-not center) and works the night shift. It's usually slower and less stressful. He loves what he does.    Pay is not good until you get more experience, even then, it is nearly 100,000 a year lower than a senior 747 pilot.      You work in shifts, you cannot be late, there are monthly/bi-annual proficiency tests/performance reviews. If it lands on one of your bad days, you could be out of a job. Its highly stressful, and taxing on the brain and body. You need to be able to speak English fluently and enunciate properly. You need to have good memory, and must be able to concentrate for long periods of time. If you have A.D.D, you're out.    Hired employees enroll in a 12 week training program at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, where they are instructed in FAA regulations, aircraft performance characteristics, controller equipment, airway system fundamentals and more specific duties.      "In 2002, air traffic controllers earned a median of $91,600. $65,480 and $112,550 were the lower and upper boundaries for the middle 50 percent of all air traffic controller earnings. 10 percent of controllers made less than $46,410, and 10 percent made more than $131,610." - http://www.careeroverview.com/air-traffi...    visit here for official information and documentation (for US):  http://www.faa.gov/jobs/job_opportunitie...    http://www.thetracon.com/atcjobs.htm|`|AEqOczcCaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic...      The job entails insanely long shifts, high levels of stress and so-so pay.|`|77de9e37100af01d497ca5822d49d3e1aa	very demanding job Hannah - you need extremely good concentration and problem solving ability. A clear head is required at all times - and there are very strict rules on drinking alcohol (much stricter than for driving).    You could be employed either at an airport (in the tower or Radar App Room) controlling all the traffic in the local area - or you could work at an Area Control centre, controlling the aircraft flying along the airways, and taking them up and down to the various airports.    The pay levels are dependent on your experience and ATC Grade - which you can only improve with time.    Useful A - levels would be Geography, Maths or Physics, but its not that important.    Write to the CAA at Caa House, 44-48 Kingsway, London and they will send you a recruitment pack and give you all the info. You can also Control alongside NATS staff with the RAF, the UK ATC Services are jointly provided by NATS and the RAF.|`|77f1f0e6cc44c00b3516ecf96d3d9ae0aa	Try going to the National Air Traffic Services web site (www.nats.co.uk). They provide all the ATC coverage in this Country and you should be able to find what you want, or, ask questions.    Good hunting|`|23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	Please do not believe the bullshit that Hollywood and other media (and some of the people on Answers) spout about air traffic control. If they anywhere remotely accurate then I wouldn't go anywhere near an aeroplane.    The shifts are NOT insanely long. The stress is probably lower than that of a city bus driver (because of the training and support systems). There certainly is pressure, varying from very high to unbelievably low, but the training and support systems in place manage this very well.     You are always part of a team (not just Controllers, there are Engineers and Assistants. All professionals who's prime feature is not to 'loose their heads').    The pay is very good indeed (up to 80k typically, but you won't get that for a while) and you don't need a degree or any aeronautical related qualification. You DO need a good standard of English (which rules out most of the people who contribute to Answers).    There are minimum academic qualifications but the main thing that you need is Aptitude. This is  hard to describe (in this forum), but it's a  personal attribute that makes you suitable for the job. For example, it weeds out those who just want "glamour" or "interest". The application process includes Aptitude testing.    In the UK the main provider and trainer is NATS Ltd (formerly National Air Traffic Services). Visit their web site and everything you need to know will be there.     http://www.nats.co.uk/    Note that NATS income is solely from moving aeroplanes. At the moment there is a huge drop in the number of flights so the company revenue is lower than it should be. This may affect the number of trainees being recruited so don't be disappointed if you don't get a place first time.    Good luck.|`|ampkZtrXaa	One word, STRESS!

ISv5Y72waa	From all that I have seen it is still closed for the most part you could have seen 1 of 2 things.       1. You could have seen crews from Boh Bros. Construction Co. and TKM Joint Venture who are working on it. The are driving piles, placing pre-cast concrete bent caps and girders, and pouring bridge decks so that is a lot of traffic.      2. I know they were talking about alternating the flow of traffic. Like todays traffic update says "Alternating lane closures on the   Westbound bridge".     I really think it is still closed although they did cancel work today because of the weather.
Nr7e4jrYaa	There's just no way to know what they will take for the car without making an offer.  Too many factors come into play as to why a dealership might take less and why.  You're best bet would be to take your cash to the dealership and make them the offer.  They can either take it or watch your cash leave their store.  If they can take it, they will before letting you leave.  If they let you and your cash leave, it was an offer they weren't capable of doing.  But there's only one way to find out.|`|1SnI86BIaa	chances are that car has problems with it|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Either you finance with the dealer or Get a loan from the bank.

They are not real cheap, rather then just take a guess and replace it, I would suggest have it properly diagnosised by a trained technician.   That  sensor controls fuel mixture, so it can cause it to run better if disconnected "somewhat", we actuallly use the "disconnect" trick ourselves to diagnosis and narrow down bogging or lack of power issues
M7G3MZb5aa	the power to weight ratio of bikes is hard to match with a car, however it could be a close fight.    I would bet that the operator of the bike just wasn't skilled enough, or balsy enough to launch the bike to its full potential.    I sat down with a calculator and figured my bike is the equivalent power/weight of  coincidentally ~725hp in a 3k lb vehicle.  I have raced my friend on his r1 many times, and he USUALLY wins, however sometimes my skill at launching gets the best of him because the r1 is hard to launch than my bike.    The way i see it, the r1 should be faster, but its at the mercy of the operator.    Another fasctor is the condition of the race, some bikes use high gearing, with high redlines and cant reach speeds as  high as a car with similer power/weight could, for instance, my bike can do 0-60 in 2.7 seconds and probibly spank that mustang most likly , but it tops out at just under 160, in a race that takes place at higher speeds the car will probibly dominate.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	This calls for a YouTube video......|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	That's pretty much a 10 second bike.

v8TWvtQgaa	Don't listen to what most people tell you.  Timing on non stock and heck even stock non computer engines needs to be alot more advanced then listed.     Timing needs change based on compression, cam, head type, fuel octane.     In gen though most std small block chevys with bowl type head chamber will perform the best with 35-38* total timing..  Heart or kindy shaped chambers will do best with 30-34* total.     Now total timing is the intail timing plus the mech. advance and no vac advance.     To check an set total you need a dail back timing light, or a degreed damper.     Now you can go off a good guess though. Most HEI dizzy gives 18-22* mech advance. So lets go in the middle at 20*..     So 36* total =  20* mech + X  (in this case would be 16* btdc)     Set timing to 14 to 16 degrees before TDC.     Now your stumble probbly aint the timing though. Off idle stumbles are norm a carb tunning prob, and most of the times cause of the accel pump shot or float adjustment|`|Cpdyn1M3aa	I would set it by ear.

Two inches wider than a big block Chevy.  Two inches may not sound like much, but to put it into perspective a Hemi is one inch narrower than a V12 Allison aircraft engine!  They also use a center sump oil pan which no Chevrolet frame crossmember was ever designed for.  The starter is on the wrong side and the oil filter is on the front instead of the rear.  Mounts, headers, etc. would all have to be fabricated.  Actually an entire custom front subframe would probably be your only option.  How about a nice big block Chevy?

AA11404742	Are you talking about your '91 Lumina that you asked about in the question I linked to below?  I'd say probably not.  Assuming that the garage that did the work set the timing properly, and did the assembly correctly, it's probably not worth it.  The car is 18 years old, and probably has a ton of miles on it.  It may have other mechanical issues wrong, too.  Repairing/replacing valves and piston rods would mean a major teardown and rebuild of the engine, which would probably run a few thousand dollars.  The car's probably not worth that much, is it?  <br>  <br>  Unless the car has a lot of sentimental value to you, it's probably time to find another ride.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Not on a 15 year old Ford Escort - but perhaps on a Ferrari it would be worth it.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	It can be fixed. The big question is, do you want to pay the price. Back in the late 70's I had a 1600 cc Mitsubishi with bent valves which I took the head off and had a machine shop install new valves and valve guides for a few hundred bucks. Having the remove and replace done by the shop would have costed substantially much more. Today shop rates are higher, car replacement prices are higher and wages are higher, so proportionally you're in the same fix I was in, unless you have damaged pistons or piston rods. Let's say if only your valves are bent, you might be stuck for $1200-$2000.  I'm hoping your damage is only top end stuff and your pistons,rods and crank are OK. If there's lower end damage, look for a whole rebuilt  or used engine rather than rebuilding yours. There have been good deals on used iimported Japanese engines, but you'll have to install it- $100/hr for 8 hrs work. This answer is based on common run-of-the-mill transportation. If it's a Mercedes or Porsche, sell it.<br>  <br>  When they say replace the cam belt at 60k-90k miles, this is the consequence for not doing it.|`|1OH9Wdrwaa	Yes, I concur.<br>  <br>  Year/Make/Model would help immensely.

Plus wear all your safety gear. <br>  4. Get one with enough engine to ride at highway speeds but watch out and not get to much engine until you have enough experience to handle it. Trust me when I say that if your bike will go 150mph you'll try it sooner or later. Wait until you can control a bike at that speed. Everything goes really fast and if something goes wrong you need to react without thinking. <br>  5.

85mGXLYjaa	While some people may think a capacitor is pointless i personally think a capacitor or a Dry cell battery can provide less stress on your car's electrical system and car's alternator, it can also improve your bass response , also know that a capacitor needs to be charged with a proper bulb resistor before being put to work.    Sound setups vary in Bass Output     While sealed sub enclosure provide tight accurate bass  Ported or vented sub enclosures provide longer lasting bass  And last but not least expect a more aggressive bass sound from a Bandpass enclosure..    To the GUY above where does the amp get power from when the car is off and the radio is On  (from the alternator ? lmao)     The alternator charges the battery While a high output alternator only does a better job of charging a battery and providing power to power hungry amps.    Like a battery, a capacitor is an energy storage device. While a battery stores and releases energy through an electro-chemical reaction, a capacitor stores energy via an electrostatic charge and releases it when needed.    That's why they are called Power cap's or Stiffening Cap's    You can add a Cap or upgrade your car battery to a Dry cell battery yellow or red stinger battery they are both for car audio and upgrade your alternator to a High output Alternator that is if your lights are dimming and your amp needs more power .  Some people think that they can get more bass by adding more electrical upgrades the problem can also lie within the amp itself, power and ground gauge thickness,subs, sub enclosure etc    I never knew an amp gets power from an alternator i always thought the alternator charged the car's battery which is where power is stored than provided to whatever electric component needs it.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	replace the battery you have now with a yellow top battery(dont add it, it will cause too much strain on your alternator so replace it), the yellow top battery are specifically for if you are using it with an audio system, red tops arent for that. you could get a higher output alternator as well, because in my opinion the battery wont do much help unless you upgrade the alternator with it    or you could just upgrade the big three, which is VERY cheap compared to the battery and alternator, and it may solve any problems you ever may have.      edit:____    the guy below me is completly wrong.    A capacitor is only good so far as the audio system isn't trying to pull too much from the electrical system. A cap doesn't provide more power, it's designed to 'stiffen' the voltage to the amp, nothing else. If the current isn't there, a cap won't help. The alternator must have at least 20% more amperage power than the entire vehicle and sound system combined for a cap to be of benefit which is ironically the same requirements for an amp to be efficient. A cap does it's best to keep the voltage at a certain level, but if the voltage changes so will the cap voltage. The cap just makes the change smoother. The diming light syndrome isn't a voltage issue but rather a current (amperage) drop. The voltage simply follows what the current does. A cap does not help this situation at all. A cap doesn't provide more power nor does it try to correct it.A cap is perfect for a noisy voltage line or if the car has fast, erratic voltage spikes/drops. This is why caps are used in AC to DC power supplies as they are used to smooth out the DC ripple for a more smooth DC output.    a cap will not help increase bass response, considering it has nothing to do with adding more "power" to the subwoofers.    The REAL powerplant of the car is the alternator. The ONLY purpose of the battery is to start the car and run the accessories with the engine off, nothing else.    also, an amplifier does NOT take power from your battery, it takes power from your alternator, if it took power from your battery why would lights dim? no, light dimming is from an ALTERNATOR trying to put out more electrical current than it can possible, which causes electrical "blips" in the circuit. a battery is only used for STARTING a car, the alternator is what runs all accessories.. battery is only used for any electical accessories when the car is OFF, which you should not have a high power audio system running while the car is off.|`|VR0h4L32aa	get a yellow top battery thats it, if your light dim and such, then get a big alt.|`|Mqs2Y4hJaa	The battery acts (in some ways) as a capacitor, in that it stores extra energy generated by the Alt. until it's needed and not being generated by the Alt. (ie. when the car is turned off, or when consuming more energy than the Alt can provide).    A cap will be able to provide an extremely large amount of energy in less time than a battery can, but doesn't store as much energy for as long a time as a lead acid battery would.    Although caps aren't always needed, I generally use 1 Farad per 1000watts used for subwoofers, if anything to improve bass response, to reduce charge/drain cycles on your battery, and reduce rapid load fluctuations in the alternator's coils. - How Stuff Works    They aren't very big, and aren't very expensive, but in my opinion are good insurance for the long run (but I tend to keep my cars to around 200,000mi.).    watts = volts X amps

SEIgcfDjaa	The three reasonable-cost mods you can make to your car (almost all modern cars, for that matter) are:    Improve air intake system by fitting a Cold Air Intake (CAI) in place of the factory air cleaner and ducting;    Replace the rear part of the exhaust system with a "Cat-Back" exhaust system, and;    Replacing the Electronic Control Module or Engine Control Module's memory chip with a performance-orientated one.    Doing all three will get you approx. 10-15% higher engine horsepower.      KNOW THIS: Engine noise will be louder, perhaps unpleasant or "droning," esp. with the exhaust mod.  Your fuel economy may improve or get worse (but just a little, which ever way it goes).  Drivability may suffer.  Finally, if your car must pass emission testing every year, it may fail due to the memory chip replacement.  Keep the old one, and learn how to reinstall it.      Cost of all three will probably be around $1000.  Beware of cheap ($50) mods you see on ebay that proport to give you the same power increase as the much more expensive chip replacement- they do not work.  Beyond those mods, you will have to spend much more money, and several weekends installing, adjusting and fixing the things that break, in order to get more power.|`|qPz4Dem3aa	Depends on what the Altima has done to it.

Especially true if the replacement vehicle is expensive (registration and insurance costs will be higher) and if you have to finance it.    I drive older vehicles and put a lot of miles on them. Current driving a 1990 voyager mini-van with 335,000 miles on it. I realize that one of these days it is going to break and I will probably have it fixed. For the money I would have to spend just on insurance and registration for a new car (not including actually paying for the new car) I can do a lot of repairs to the old one!    As vehicles age, there is a greater chance that something is going to break and leave you stuck. Often times people use this as a justification to buy a new car. While I don't dismiss this, even a relatively new car can have problems (bought a brand-new vehicle many years ago, had less than 1,000 miles on it and the transmission had to be replaced).    Take good care of any car and it will last a long time. That means changing the oil, letting it warm up a little before driving and have small problems fixed right away (before they turn into big problems).|`|gNWTH50Aaa	You should go to www.kbb.com and input all the data about your car.

SEIgcfDjaa	Most likely it is the CV joints, if happens when going forward with the wheel turned.  Probably gets louder or more frequent when accelerating, right?      The other things you mention would make these kinds of sounds:    Rods (steering), struts (suspension) one or at most two pops when turning, even when car is standing still.    Wheel bearings:  howling or whinning noise, gets louder and/or higher in pitch as speed increase.    Chances are, only one CV joint is making the noise, although you will probably want to replace all 4 (2 per side of the car) at the same time.  Unfortunately, this is not an inexpensive repair- figure on about $600 or more, and you will probably have to replace the entire half-shaft.  The good news is the new CV joints will probably last the life of the car.  Frankly, the originals should have gone alot longer, unless you are driving the car VERY hard or the rubber boots that keep dust out of them are torn.  The repair MAY be covered under the manufacturer's warranty, even if you are not the original owner.  Check with a Mazda dealer, ask if they are covered BEFORE you leave it with anyone (INCLUDING the dealer) for repairs.|`|141e767cd7a7c8372579f0ff18e95891aa	Smart money is on the CV joints.|`|g6easyBFaa	Although steveboudreaux is probably correct in his answer, there is one more very simple possibility to look at before blowing money on repairs.

The factory had to specify an increased torque level for the nuts due to this.

The timing belt does not have to be changed yet as someone else has written; it has to be replaced at 105,000 miles.  At that time the water pump should be inspected at the very least, but probably a good idea to replace it at the same time.  It will cost between $500 and $700 to do that, but shop around.  Aside from that, the car should be faithful and trouble-free to 150,000 miles and beyond.

Then you set up some standards like it can't cost more than this, or it has to come in Automatic too, or just certain things that you think are important in a car.     After you've narrowed down the list of cars than look at consumer reviews and reliability on the cars and pick the one that will last the longest or has the best reviews.     Hondas Toyotas and Nissans are very reliable. German cars cost a lot to repair.

I don't want a car that is so expensive that I can't afford to drive it.  I also don't want some cheap piece of crap that I will hate.  Also, with a set price range I am not wasting my time looking at vehicles that I can not afford.    I then take a close look at my needs.  I pretty much know what size and type vehicle fits my personal needs.    I then consider my personal preference on the vehicle manufacturer.    I then look to see what vehicle(s) are available that fit the qualifications that I listed above.  I will use the Internet to research these vehicles.    I will then go the the dealer and take some test drives to narrow it down to which vehicle I like best.    I tend to keep my vehicles a very long time.  So I must really be satisfied with what I choose.|`|WHDQ068iaa	all about the car!  i would rather spend more on a car that i LOVE to drive than less on a car that i HATE!|`|9b8955c587bca8960062ebd22cce1e03aa	You first figure out what you want to use the car for:    Is it for hauling loads, not friends: a pickup truck  Is it for hauling friends, not loads: a minivan  Is it for both: a fullsize SUV or fullsize van  Is it for driving around the city: a hybrid or subcompact car  Is it for long distance driving on the highway: a fullsize car or luxury car  Is it for a combination of the two: a compact or midsize car  Is it for off-roading: an SUV or a pickup truck with 4-Wheel Drive  Is it for ice and snow: something with All-Wheel Drive or 4-Wheel Drive  Is it for fun: a sportscar or a convertible    Once you've decided what you want to use the vehicle for, the next step is to find out how much money you have.    Lots of money ($30,000+): look at luxury models  Moderate money ($20,0000): look at newer models and used luxury  Good money ($10,000): look at aged models and old luxury cars  Fair money ($5,000): look at decent models from the 1990s  My money ($2,000): look at basic 1990s models and good 1980s models.    Lastly, once you have a category, you narrow it down with a category, you ask another question on Yahoo Answers about which car you should get with the added data of price and preference, plus other things that may matter to you like performance, style, and reliability.    After you receive some answers, look them up at Wikipedia (new and used cars) or their respective manufacturer websites (new cars only).    Lastly, once you've narrowed it down to a couple choices, you search for them at this website:    http://www.autotrader.com    This site lets you put in your criteria and search in your area or nationwide.    That's how I pick my vehicles. I live in an area with snow one third of the year, so All-Wheel Drive or 4-Wheel Drive is a must. I like off-roading, so I eliminated All-Wheel Drive. I also like convertibles, and I don't mind driving older vehicles, so that left me with this small list of choices:    Chevrolet K-5 Blazer  Dodge Ramcharger  Ford Bronco  Geo Tracker  GMC Jimmy  Isuzu Amigo  Jeep CJ  Jeep Wrangler  Kia Sportage  International Scout II  Land Rover Defender  Land Rover Series III  Nissan Patrol  Plymouth Trailduster  Suzuki Samurai  Suzuki Sidekick  Toyota 4Runner  Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40    I only had a budget of about $5,000, so I eliminated the Jeep Wrangler, both Land Rovers, and the Toyota 4Runner, which are expensive. I wanted good ground clearance for off-roading, so the Geo, Kia, and Suzukis were gone. I also wanted decent gas mileage, so anything with a V-8 only was out. This got rid of the Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, GMC, International, and Plymouth.     This left only four models: the Isuzu, the Jeep CJ, the Nissan, and the Toyota Land Cruiser. I couldn't find a Nissan or a Toyota, so that left the Isuzu and the Jeep.    This is where the argument begins. Which do I like better. The Isuzu is more modern and has better performance. The Jeep has more style and a better engine. The Isuzu is cheaper to buy and more reliable. The Jeep is cheaper to modify and has removeable doors and windshield. Decisions, decisions.    In the end, I went with the Jeep, as it was the first one I found, and the seller offered me a great deal to make it a better deal than the Isuzu. I've been happy with it ever since.    I hope this has answered your question. If you have any more, please feel free to ask.|`|e0CED2EZaa	all three;  sexy, not that expensive, fast..        wrx.|`|CD9ZMxBTaa	when you see a car you like and there is a small tickle down low... then that is the one you want :)

zruhNGKbaa	A Carburetor is a mechanical device which mixes the fuel and air being drawn into an engine into the correct mixture to burn.  <br>  <br>  Carburetors utilize the venturi principal to draw the fuel from the reservoir or float bowl into the airstream at a rate proportional to the rate of the airflow entering the engine, the airflow rate is controlled by the throttle valve at the bottom of the carburetor. <br>  <br>  Carburetors were the primary means of creating the fuel air mixture on virtually all gasoline fueled engines before the middle to late 1980's. They are still common on small engines of the type used on lawnmowers and other small power equipment. <br>  <br>  There were a few available fuel injection systems prior to that time but they were mechanical in operation and very expensive - generally used only in professional race cars.   <br>  <br>  They have been replaced by electronic fuel injection systems on modern engines because the electronic systems provide better mixture control and faster response to changing conditions resulting in both better performance and economy in addition to reduced exhaust emissions, which were the driving force in the development of electronic fuel injection systems because carburetors are inherently sloppy and not consistent in the blending of the fuel air mixture which resulted in high levels of hydrocarbon emissions from the tailpipe.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It's spelled carburetor and it's a mechanical device used for mixing the air and fuel together just before it enters the intake plenum/manifold.  They still are around on some motorcycles and smaller engines but have been replaced by various forms of fuel injection systems on modern passenger cars.|`|bIJAGVjZaa	www.google.com|`|AA11242316	It's a fuel metering device. They were used on car engines up until electronic fuel injection became prevalent. A carburetor controls engine speed and output, based on throttle setting.<br>  Essentially, air passes through the throttle blades and into a venturi. A venturi is an hourglass shaped passage. At the narrow section, the air trades pressure for velocity. Fuel is contained in a reservoir called a fuel bowl at atmospheric or greater pressure. The pressure differential in the venturi draws fuel through a passage called a jet, where it mixes with the air and enters the intake manifold of the engine. There is a float in the fuel bowl attached to a valve that opens as the fuel level drops (to admit more fuel) and closes as the level rises (to cut off fuel flow into the bowl). The throttle blades control the amount of air that enters the venturi and are directly connected to the accelerator pedal. As the blades are opened, more air can enter the venturi. More air requires greater airspeed, which translates to lower air pressure at the narrow section of the venturi, so more fuel is drawn through the jet.<br>  Realistically, there are a lot more details involved, but that's the basic theory.
jYy6dDAZaa	Corn ethanol is a bad political idea to placate iowa farmers, a better source is sawgrass that grows wild in the turnrows of the field, more yield with less water and care plus a new crop.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Total lose.     - You're burning 0.8 gallons of fossil fuel to make 1 gallon of ethanol. http://www.mda.state.mn.us/renewable/ren...    - Granted you're using more "coal" fossil fuel which is American, so it helps with energy independence.     - It grabs up American corn production, which has its own set of problems - read "The Omnivore's Dilemma" part 1.     - Factory farm corn production is extremely dependent on mass quantities of fossil fuel.     - Corn monoculture.  Suicidally bad idea.  The year a superbug comes along and kills all our corn, millions will die of hunger.     - Its economics make no sense, except that it's driven by a graft-ridden boondoggle of government farm subsidy laws written by the agriculture industry.     - Fuel or food?  Duh.     - The MPG is terrible.  You get 20% less real fuel for your money.     - It's not very good for engines either.     - Run of the mill cars can't run it, they must be special flex-fuel cars.     - It requires a staggering amount of energy to distill. That's why they're building new coal plants in ethanol country, to power the distilleries.     - "Cellulosic ethanol" is a pipedream and still has many of these problems.     Biodiesel has none of these problems.  It takes little energy to make, it can be made from non-food crops that will grow where food won't, it can use waste oil (fryer oil), and it works in any diesel.  Heck, vegetable oil will work directly in anything made for bunker oil, and any large industrial diesel with minor changes.|`|g2yUDLygaa	It's not a very good answer for alleviating our dependency on foreign oil.  Some smart individual figured out that even if the U.S. bought all the corn grown everywhere on the planet and refined it into ethanol we still wouldn't produce enough annually to satisfy the demands of all U.S. consumers driving ethanol-powered vehicles (assuming 75% or more of the U.S. population HAD ethanol-powered vehicles).  Yes, we can also refine sugar into ethanol, but we still wouldn't produce enough corn and sugar to satisfy the demands of the entire world.  Ethanol-powered vehicles would be a Band-Aid fix at best.|`|AA10346371	Anything to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is good.    I am not a big fan of making ethanol from corn or any other item that could be used as food.    However, I am a big fan of cellulosic ethanol.  This ethanol is made from waste wood products, switch grass, corn stalks, and many waste products that are not considered food.  There are several of these type ethanol plants coming on line.  Also, this type of ethanol takes less energy to produce and produces a higher yield with the materials used.    As for the reduced fuel efficiency and performance with ethanol, this will improve as more ethanol is available.  Here's why.  Current vehicles are flex fuel designs made to primarily run on gasoline but can also use ethanol.  The problem with this design is that the engine has too low of compression ratio to take advantage of the 107+ octane of E85 fuel.  The low compression is required to prevent detonation while burning gasoline.  The Flex Fuel design is required because E85 is not yet available in all areas.    Once E85 is more available, we should start seeing E85 only vehicles.  The engine in this vehicle can have a compression ratio above 13:1 which would burn the ethanol much more efficiently.  You will have better fuel economy and more power than a low compression gasoline with this design.

When a dramatic vector change is caused by a force in the vehicle that the friction between the tires and road cannot handle, the car will slide.

I have seen it also. If they were driving too fast and stopped really quickly the cars momentum will flip it right over.|`|f9f27Cmhaa	At some point while sliding sideways, it encountered enough resistance to the sideways movement that the car flipping onto its top required less energy than the amount of energy required to allow the tires to slide along the ground.    In other words, they were in the process of doing a donut, and either hit something solid, or found a patch of non-slippery pavement.|`|MxRk2JM8aa	In order for a car to flip over.  The momentum that is usually in the forward direction gets turned 90 degrees.  Since the wheels don't turn that way, the top of the car will end up at a higher rate of speed than the wheels.  Flip.    The turn to 90 degrees is accomplished by speed + ice.    Another way is a tire blowing out.  That can cause a driver to over correct and end up sideways and flip.|`|5areDQzaaa	The reason a car flips is because it either hit a curb going sideways or the friction (resistance to move) from the road/tires causes the momentum from the center of gravity (it's the point in space where you can say is the average of its mass) to overcome the balance from the car. Sports cars have low centers of gravity making them incredibly hard to flip because the center of gravity is too low to be able to make the cars weight spin over on set of wheels. This is based on the physics of leverage. Is it harder to open a door from the farthest point of the handle from the spindle or the one closest to it? Friction is the cause that enables the car to act like it is pinned to the ground by on set of wheels in a flipping scenario.    Snow actually makes the car harder to flip, as do the bald tires, they cause lower friction between the road and the tires. So the car will slide if you try flipping it over, nothing is forcing the weight back toward you, like trying to run on ice with regular shoes.  My guess is one side of the tires had to hit something from the side.|`|JXWC0fxPaa	Any vehicle that makes a sudden change in direction is subject to rollover. This is especially true if a vehicle gets sideways on its path of travel. Moving air gets underneath the vehicle, which has changed its center of balance, and the air will lift the vehicle off the pavement. This is seen most commonly at NASCAR races. Loss of traction on wet or snow covered roads means that any vehicle is subject to loss of control and rollover, even at relatively low speeds of 30-40 mph.|`|K2o7xcstaa	Really drunk people.|`|0VSYYddPaa	your god was messing with **** again

Not having an accident, or any violation/citation for that matter, will rack up discounts like you wouldn't believe. <br>  For lowering it now, that can be a little more difficult. If you have homeowners insurance already, combine policies to one insurer in order to get their second biggest discount that they offer, a multy-line discount. This is like a thank you from your provider for giving them more business as well as cementing yourself, in their eyes, as a long term customer. <br>  There are also many reasons why your premium could have gone up as well. If you have had any citations of violations in the last three years, they stay on until they drop off of your record. Once they drop off, your premium will go down for sure.<br>  There's really just too many to list to be honest, auto insurance is simple, yet complicated at the same time.

This is Lake Superior we're talkin' about and thar be dragons.    Be advised that the Great Lakes are huge bodies of water and have the potential to take just about anything and anybody down.

The problem with buying new wheels for your car, is that if one gets jacked up, you are stuck putting the old ones back on.  Not to mention that your wheels that are probably 16s now are about 300 for tires where as the 17s will be close to 500.  I would find a different way of stimulating the economy.

d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	If you as a private individual or company went out to buy 1000 streeetcars (nobody ever buys ONE streetcar)... you would probably pay about 1 million bucks each.     However, if you are a government institution, and you plan to ask the Federal government to pitch in additional money to help, then... you need to painstakingly specify EXACTLY what you want (and that is exactly what you get, even if you make a mistake)... and this fills several huge binders.  Mind you, this is your custom spec, so you're not buying a standard "brand X model Y" streetcar, you're having something built totally new just for you.  As you would expect, this is crazy expensive.     Add in several hundred pages of additional "terms and conditions" like a fraction of the cars must be built in the USA with USA workers; a fraction of the subcontractors must by minority owned; etc. etc. until your eyes bleed from trying to read it all.      Then you put this out for bid.  Every company bidding spends several million dollars just READING all these specifications and terms, and millions more trying to figure out what they should quote to make a profit building it.  Low bidder wins!      Ain't that great? Your streetcar gets built by the LOW BIDDER!  That's the law.  You can't just go to a reputable builder and say "I'd like one of those" like you do when you buy your own automobile.     Then they start actually building them, and you find mistakes and things that need to be changed. Back to the specification.  If you wrote the spec wrong, you pay for "change orders".  Back and forth.  Lawyers involved. Blueprint reading lawyers.  Yikes.     So far, you have spent $2.5 million per streetcar, and it is a piece of JUNK, like it was designed by an army of monkeys and blueprint reading lawyers.  Now the lawsuits begin.  Between them and reworking the cars to be actually useful to you, you spend another $0.5 million per car.     Grats, you just paid $3 million for a $1 million streetcar.
d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Maybe he's just one of those random idiots who doesn't know how to make a left turn on that type of road.  There are plenty of those in all seasons, and they all break the law, and that should be readily apparent to them by the large number of people they have to honk at.  When in Rome...     Or maybe he was afraid of getting stuck in the snow in the center lane.  However, he was willing to CROSS that lane, so I'm not sure I buy that.  If he was really afraid of getting stuck, he should have proceeded straight past the turn, found a more clear place to do a U-turn, then come back and made a right.     For all you could determine, he was broken down.  A common thing in snowstorms.   It seems reasonable to have gone around him.  I don't think he'd have a case in court.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	The minivan driver is wrong.  He/she should at least make an effort to get into the turning lane regardless the condition of the turning lane.  A road hogger seems to do that, care less about people who follow him/her.  If the van just sitting there in the through lane I would assume it stalled or stuck or something.  I would find a way to get around it.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The idiot in the thru lane was impeding traffic flow - simple as that - that's why there's a turn lane.|`|0lBwS4QFaa	You should never pass on the left in this situation even though the van is in the wrong lane. You would be causing the accident if the van turns right when you are passing. The van is responsible for on coming traffic and is not looking at who is passing behind them. You should just wait until the van turns and be on your way.   If everyone kept passing on the left the van would never be able to turn. you would most likely get the ticket due to road conditions and you unsafe lane change.  You know he is the wrong lane but he does not, but this doe not give you the right to pass on the left.|`|wfqh2bARaa	I thought you were going to say "CRASH"!  Luckily you didn't.  Anyway, just my opinion and some time as a copper, but I'd have to say you were wrong.  You have to be lenient when snow covers the ground; it's just plain hard to see.|`|ISv5Y72waa	I would say the van was wrong for not using the middle lane to turn left. I agree with LeAnn who said that "that's what the turning lane is for". That is pretty obvious. However, You were also wrong for passing on the left. You should never pass on the left.    If I had to weigh a more and less wrong I would say that you were more wrong only because your (oh and the other car's) passing on the left could have done more damage then the van holding up traffic to turn.    Sorry.
43DHFQnKaa	-in terms of dependability/performance all of the top names (flowmaster, magnaflow, borla slp, bassani) all provide the same basic high levels,  so there is not a lot to compare between any of these fine systems.    -in terms of overall performance best installation is performance exhaust system-catbacks.    -ultimate decision will usually come down to the sound provided by the aftermarket - system and generally most truck owners go with magnaflow or flowmasters.....but there are lots of sound clips on you tube so that's a good starting point.    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=9niZM35xos...  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=qDsPrFpD53...  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=pyhcKBOfAQ...    if you want the loudest sound and deep - you can install electric exhaust cutouts  http://www.racereadyperformance.com/prod...    if you install the cutout before after the headers & the before the cats-seriously loud,  and if installed after the cats in order to dump the exhaust before the mufflers-still loud!  they operate from inside the truck, flick of the switch-loud,  flick again quieter and legal  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=z3PCHgKCe0...    had these on my last ride-great.

ZAPWDFKxaa	Most state laws will put the blame on the person backing up, as you have to make sure it is clear before you start backing up.  It might depend on if you live in a no fault state or not.  If you are in a no fault state, each person would file with their own carrier.  If not, then I would call the claim in and give them your version.  Even if you don't and she calls your carrier, they would still have to verify facts with you before they do anything.  You are probably right, a parking lot accident is too low of speed to make her alignment go off.  The deciding factors on chargeability will be if you are majority at fault for the accident and if the payment goes over a certian threshold that the insurance company has to make it a chargeable loss.|`|r50v64d2aa	For auto insurance the easiest method to get a free quote is do a policy comparison.

R4MoRylnaa	yes<br>  try to find all of the screws in the door(most are probably covered by plugs). then pop out the little plastic pins behind the panel. They will be located around the edge of the panels. If you can get your hands on a panel popper, that is the bast way to pop the pins out. if not, use two flat head screwdrivers. feel around the back of the panel with one of the screwdrivers and when you find one, put the other one on the other side of the pin and carefully pop them out individually. The door panel will not come completely off so don't force it. its all easy from there

And that Acura is scary fast and has amazing Super Handling All Wheel Drive. I've taken off ramps at 70 with no problem.|`|d5c72dc4adab680a19c78052d440383daa	First off, none will be "least expensive" to maintain if anything unforeseen breaks.  The most reliable historically would be the LS400, but not sure which model year you're looking into, but it's 2000 or earlier, so we're talking atleast an 9 year old car, with x-number of miles... it's hard to say right?<br>  <br>  Without having specifics like year or mileage, I would say rule out the ES and I, since they are 6-cylinder, front wheel drives and basically luxurious Camry and Maximas respectively.  <br>  <br>  Thus leaving the LS and RL.  Acura RL also front wheel drive and not particularly luxurious to me.  So, with all things being equal, the LS is the way to go.|`|fvN18yvGaa	the Es 300 is a reliable but over priced camry...for another 20 grand ull be in 400 territory with all the benefits of a car that's been voted most reliable, cost effective and great resale value ...Infinity's are troublesome..75% of luxury cars are leased.... so you can find plenty of 2 and 4yr old ones if you wanna go that route..|`|H66RHumIaa	I have an Acura (MDX) and a Lexus... they are reliable... but sometimes the navigation of the Acura is off a little, but all cars have small problems like that...|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	Lexus or Acura.

Honda Civics are really good on fuel economy and their maintenance costs are generally low.
JXWC0fxPaa	A teen should have a vehicle with the most protection features that a parent can afford. There is nothing on any vehicle that will prevent a crash from happening. I believe that all the advertising about the so-called safety features on vehicles today present us with a false sense of security leading us to believe that nothing will happen to us.    All this means is that if the teen is thoroughly trained and aware of the risks and responsibilities of driving, then there should be little use of ABS, crumple zones and airbags.    All the best.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yes. It is far better for the computer to try and stop the car than for some inexperienced kid to try and do it. ABS will allow him/her to steer while braking if he slams on the brakes. Otherwise he/she's just going to slide off into the ditch, or the car in front of them.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  ABS was a system that was designed with the express purposed of increasing traction and it would lessen the stop time if the brakes were applied with greater force.  This system has saved countless lives, and it has decreased the amount of accidents on the road.  I think the system itself would increase the safety measures on a vehicle, especially if a teen were to drive it.  In my mind, teens need as much protection as possible.  ABS offers that extra security in case the brakes would need to be applied quickly.  So yes, it should be a system incorporated in a teen's first car.  The only thing is in addition to adding ABS, the teen must make sure they are driving safely.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Yes..........because it will help them a lot more in stopping and controlling the vehicle if the situation arises..|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Never hurts to have ABS if your in a climate that is prone to cold icy weather. The ABS lets the tires roll slightly during a skid. This in turn allows the driver to keep pressure on the brakes and still maintain control of the car. If a car is skidding, the drive can not manouver the car out of danger. Also you stop faster if you keep your tires rolling a little than you would if you were in a skid. Because teens don't have the same awarness of bad driving conditions I think it's really good to make sure a teen's first car has ABS. Usually if teen's get into a bad spot they won't be calm enough to remember to let off the brake and pump. It's best to let the car do it for them.|`|AA10725587	There is a good chance that any teenager now adays is getting a car with abs brakes.  If most people drove a car without abs brakes there would proabably be more wrecks.  People are idiots and bad drivers.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Yes, as a class they don't have a lot of experience and a lot of bad judgment.

They have repair manuals for nearly every anticipated problem imagined. You need to figure out what caused the plug to rust in the first place. Did it rust from the outside in or the inside out?? You may only need to install a screw with adhesive to stop the problem. If the plug rusted from the inside out, you have been using the WRONG coolant. It got toxic, overly acidic, and WHAM!!! Get smart!!! After you repair the problem, flush out your cooling system and use only GENUINE FORD COOLANT. The updated version is YELLOW, not green. It prevents rust, scale, and premature part failure. IT HAS a DIFFERENT chemical com-position than other coolants!! There is a good chance that if one of your plugs has rusted out, they ALL are weakened. Most auto stores have a tool that is used to remove bad plugs. New ones are cemented in place as well as tapped into place. Good Luck!!!|`|pJThuVtzaa	Take a hamer and chisel.

1YS1hFQFaa	engine wears off and also the transmition you can not really tell just by looking at it because peple can add stuff to make it run good for few days then it goes bad<br>  <br>  bes advice is get a mechanic check it out before you buy it they test for comprssion and emmissions<br>  <br>  also look for rust and the health of the tires  <br>  <br>  some cars are well kept and miles mean nothing but you really need a mecanich to check it out if you dont know the car owners|`|ygimTNzoaa	Think of what might happen to a car the more you drive it. The more you drive it, the more miles are on it, which means if certain parts haven't gone bad/broke/wore on it yet then chances are, soon they will and you'd be stuck with the repair bill. Intrepids are monsters though, my older sister ws addicted, she bought 2 of them, though I don't know how many miles were on them, but gives me an impression her dedication to the car means it's reliable.<br>  <br>  So, though there's so many miles on it, it also depends on how much you're paying. Then there's other little things like, how many people have owned this car before, the more owners probably the more likely chance the car was abused or mistreated, which means more likely the car may soon fail on you. I like to stick to newer cars mainly because I get extended warranty's which usually extend up to 100,000. Or more but mine is 100,000 warranty I have a 2006 VW Passat with 86,000 miles on it. Let me tell ya, these warranty's are worth every penny, for me anyway. <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's your decision, Unless you're paying less then $5k, I say get a newer car with an extended warranty. I've never regreted a warranty.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Well you have to start replacing more things, like engine, transmission, all that expensive stuff.

That dosnt mean it will break on you, but it has a very high probability of doing so.  In rare cases, owners take meticulous care of their cars, regular oil changes and regular maintenance at the perfect intervals, and their cars can go for a couple hundred thousand miles.  Also, some companies are more known for reliability than others, like Toyota, Honda, Volvo, BMW. But since this is not the case most of the time, and its a dodge, you may end up paying more than the car is worth to keep it running.  If you buy it, make sure you ask the owner questions about major repairs like the timing chain and watter pump.|`|IWSZp6Glaa	Everything starts to wear out, lots of expensive things to replace. Also, if it has the 2.7 V6, you should know that it is a sludge prone engine. So with high miles, its not worth it.

In the long run, the Subaru Boxer design is worth it.|`|PmaB839Naa	First it is ten years old and that is alot of miles. See if you can get a record of what has been replaced.

If this is all good, then check the brake lines and make sure they're not broken. If they aren't, then the problem might lie in the Hydraulic brake booster, with out this, the braking distance is increased drastically and pedal travel will too.

If so then you have power, therefore it's the motor or it is off track.

There is a fuse diagram on this cover. If you step on the brake you should hear a click noise with the key on. If you don't hear the click, then either your BTSI solenoid is malfunctioning or there is a problem in that specific circuit. If all else fails you can remove that tiny rectangular piece of plastic to the left of the shifter assembly near the P (park) position on the shifter.

If you want to avoid any issues about that, ask him. Another option is to pay him back to avoid confusion. However, since the car is in your name and you are driving it and got the loan, it is actually yours. The best thing is to talk it out with him. What would you do in a business deal? Your answer to that question will be the same no matter who paid off your car (relative or non-relative).|`|tJ0WNq9eaa	The loan company should send YOU and statement that the lien has been removed.

Cpdyn1M3aa	These intake crack all too often, that is why they have it in stock at the parts store.  Someone said to get the service manual, always a good decision.  A few other suggestions would be:    1) Get a big cardboard box, like the one the intake comes in, a ball point pen, and a phillips screwdriver.  2) Look at the new intake and see where the bolts go.  3) Stab the box with the screwdriver in the same pattern as the bolt holes on the intake, and mark one end with an arrow and "Front"  4) Every bolt you take out of anything stab the box and write down what it is for, then stick the bolt in the hole in the box.    You will also want to put in new coolant, 50% coolant 50% water and a new thermostat.  You can purchase 50/50 premix, or just mix it yourself with tap water.  I personally take an extra jug and make my own premix before I put it in the engine.    Also bungee cords are nice for holding wire harnesses out of the way.

You should have pulled over somewhere (safe) and see what he wanted.  I mean, obviously it's important, if he's following you around instead of taking his food home to whoever's waiting for it.     Right now it's your word that you and he talked and agreed there was no damage.  It's a reasonable precaution to swap information in case there turns out to be damage.     I know, I know, you wanted to avoid contact with him at all costs, because you were afraid of having to pay a repair bill or have your insurance go up or something.  That's a normal reaction.  But, that's also what the law forbids, and it harshly punishes those who do it.    Now, if an insurer calls you, don't play games to avoid them, just take the call and give them your insurance info.  Once they have your info, they can't say you hit-n-run.   Don't negotiate with them, though; that's your agent's job.

If you happen to owe more in the loan then what they payout (if it's a brand new loan it's possible) then you'll have to make up the difference.  If you owe less, then you'll be paid whatever's left over after the loan's paid off.|`|ZAPWDFKxaa	The insurance company will figure out the actual cash value on the car.

With a lender, they will get the payoff and if it is higher than the value on your car they will send all of the money to them and you will be left to refinance the balance. If the payoff is less than your value, they will send the check to your lender to close the account and the balance will go to you.  Of course, they will back off your deductible. Make sure you do some research in your area on what the average of cars like yours.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	If you have collision coverage then your insurance company will send an appraiser to estimate the damage done to your vehicle.    If the damage exceeds a certain amount of the value of the car, then they will consider it to be a total loss. Most states the total loss threshold is about 70-75%.    Then will then run an evaluation to determine the actual cash value. The settlement will be sent to your lender for the loan.  If the loan is more than the car is worth, you are responsible for paying the difference.    If the loan is less than the value, the loan will be paid off and the remainder will be sent to you.    If the vehicle is repairable, the insurance will send a check for the repair cost (minus your deductible) to the body shop
VEIkVDtIaa	there are two separate problems.  the P0845 is for an electrical problem with the third gear pressure switch.  In almost all cases with that code the problem is that the switch isn't working.  you'll have to replace the switch to fix it.  if there were an internal problem you would get a code for the transmission slipping or the torque converter not engaging.  you don't have those codes so in all likelyhood it is a thrid gear pressure switch failure.    that switch will only be available through a honda dealer.  its a relatively inexpensive repair.    the P0420 is for a deteriorated catalytic converter.  the onboard diagnostic system measures the efficiency of the convertor to take harmful exhaust gasses and turn them into harmless tailpipe emissions through a chemical reaction of the bad gasses with the catalytic elements.  Over time the catalytic elements become depleted as they give up a few molecules of their being in every chemical reaction.  when the converter is judged to have less than 50% of its original capacity to convert exhaust gasses then the light comes on to alert you to the need to replace the converter.    if the car is in the US and you have under 80,000 miles then the converter is covered under the Federal Emissions Warranty and will be replaced at no charge.  If you have over 80,000 miles its a very pricy replacement.    you can drive the car forever witht he bad converter as it won't cause your car to stall out or anything.  (some domestics will stall with a deteriorated conveter but hondas won't as they are of a different design)  it just won't pass an emissions test.  so if your state tests for emissions you'll have to replace the converter to pass the emissions test.    Hope that helps|`|DapNp1Kxaa	I dunno. My 2005 CR-V keeps telling me that maintenance is required, but no one can find anything wrong. I will be watching your question closely.

bvCkplELaa	Sounds like motor mounts to me. Here is a very basic test that any "do it yourselfer" can do. Drive the car, pull up to a stop light, see if you have the problem with the shaking, while holding the brake on obviously, shift into neutral and see if the shake goes away, if it does, it's 100 percent the mounts causing this.|`|JoeeBzXraa	It could be your coil packs, because they don't have to provide as much power, when your not on the gas.   If they cant deliver enough spark, then the engine will vibrate.  The more load the car is under, the rougher the vibration will get.  No it can't be your half shafts, they would produce vibrate only in motion and constantly.   Start with the coil packs.   I had bad ones once and the car bucked and vibrated so violently, that I had the transmission worked on, and that was not the problem,  I changed the coil packs on a whim and bada bing bada boom, the car was back to normal 100%.   Never underestimate the coil packs...  THEY CAN FAIL|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	motor mounts

NupfhDzXaa	350 watts might be enough for a scooter. If you use chain & sprockets to reduce it to a slow enough forward speed, it will stand pushing a go cart but probably only at 5mph.    By comparison, my golf-cart motor is rated about 1800 watts.    Anyway, the motor DOES control how many amps will go thru it. The greater the load on the motor, the more amps it will draw. The nameplate rating of 22 amps is telling you not to exceed this amount of current or the motor will overheat. If you are drawing more than 22 amps (disregarding the brief overload while you get up to speed) you will either need to lighten the load or gear it down more. The amperage draw is in proportion to the torque load on the motor. As a means to protect the motor, you could put a fuse in the line that is a little over the motor rating. 25a is probably cutting it too close and will blow when you try to take off. 30a would probably be reasonable if the starting load is not too great.    A very heavy duty switch could be used to turn the motor on and off but it would be better to use a solenoid type contactor (typically a metal can with two 1/4" threaded studs on the sides plus one or two smaller ones that connect to the coil) so that you can run smaller wires to the switch or button that makes it go. This is the simplest means of control but will be on or off only. With such a small motor you probably wont get whiplash when you hit the switch.    Most small electrically driven vehicles use either a large multi-position switch (or contactors) and resistors (very inefficient), or, an electronic motor speed control (very expensive). In your case, if full power is too much, you could use a large switch or contactors to change the wiring of the batteries, parallel for 12v for a gentle take-off, then switch to series for 24v to get more speed.    My gut feeling is that after you add the weight of the motor, batteries and go-cart, the motor will have enough to do before you put a person on it. If slow is ok with you, you might be satisfied.    Trolling motor batteries should stand a 22a load fine.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	24V is the starting point, you will need a rheostat or variable resistor for throttle control.  Test the motor in both directions, DC motors have an advanced degree,  1 way it hums the other way it sings.  Spend some of that battery power for flashing lights because go carts are hard to see, and no adult wants to drag killing some kid around for life, even if acquitted.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	no, the motor doesn't control the amps.      first, you need a pennonometer. i think that's what its called. anyways, its like a throttle, and its connected to a "controller". the controller controls how much power goes to the motor.        basically, if you set up your motor without a controller and a throttle, you would only be spinning it at full rpm.|`|q8vILEpfaa	I'm going to just leave this one alone!    Some body is  gonna get hurt!|`|AA11726095	I assume 22 amps is the "Full Load Amps".  If there is no load, the amperage will be less so if you're just wiring it up on the bench to test it, I expect no damage.  The motor will just spin up to 2600rpm.      I do think you may have other problems:  1)  350W is less than 1/2hp so I think you will smoke the motor once you try to move.  2)  Trolling motor batteries typically found on a boat are more of the deep cycle variety.  They are designed for long-life and low-output.  The 22 FLA of this motor may overload the batteries which may cause them to rupture or possibly explode.  That would be bad.  3) You need a DC motor speed control (i.e. Throttle) otherwise it's only two speeds-Go and stop.  I looked online and one for that little motor is about $300.  4)  If you go for it anyway, know that electric motors have torque at zero rpm so they are inherently dangerous.  If your throttle gets stuck, your brakes may not stop you.  Again, that would be bad.    There is a lot of danger here so you may not want to do this without more info.    Anyway, good Luck and be safe.
tO7Rpjmqaa	check for vacum leaks or you could have a dirty or a bad idle air control valve|`|c48nm70gaa	crz, Very good advice above. You can find CRC Mass Airflow Cleaner in just about any auto-parts store as well as Wallyworld (Walmart's) automotive section.    Please examine small metric screws that fasten the mass air flow sensor into the transfer housing. If you're somewhat baffled how to remove them they-may- resemble a Torx screw with a little center nub in the middle. Carquest has a small set of: Tamper Proof Torx Bits for around $12.00 for this dinky little job. Also please be aware! GM "the dirty SOB's they are" put a drop of blue loctite on the end of these little pain in the a*s screws, What you do is this: Get out a propane torch and heat the head of the screw slightly to melt the freaking Locktite. Myself, being a gung ho bonehead stripped one of these little buggers off one day. You don't need the agrivation of re-drilling the broken one out, re-tapping and replacing with a 10-14 round head Allan head screw.    The CRC cleaner works like a filthy charm.

You know the gas mileage you need, and who is going to ride in it with you. you should explore the legroom in the back seat as well. one may feel sluggish, or not handle very well compared to the other. If I were you, I would buy a used low mileage civic. They have reliable eco-friendly 4 cylinder engines, get great gas mileage, and if you buy it used it will be much less expensive, but you can still finance it if you need to build credit.   I am slightly biased towards the Honda, but in my area there are crummy corollas everywhere! most of the civics seem to have held up nicely.|`|i38Ev1Zaaa	Mid 90's honda's were the most stolen cars.

That's a serious question;  there is a difference.  I'll assume you're okay with planes, it's the flying you don't like.

If you don't look out the window, you might be able to convince the fear centers of your brain that you're on a bus or something.  It'll be easier to accomplish this at night.    Does it help to know that there hasn't been a passenger fatality on a major US carrier in over seven years?    If that doesn't help, I can almost guarantee that a Xanax or two will.  Ask your doctor.

What tranny do you have, the 700R4?     Find a donor motor from a truck or another fullsize SUV. Any 90's model with the 6.5L will work, but the year will technically need to be '92 or newer for emissions purposes.     You will need the motor mounts for the diesel motor, it will bolt right to the frame. The 6.5L will also mate directly to the 700R4 (if that IS what you have) and you will only need the diesel torque-converter and adjust the TV cable on the trans. The radiator that you have will most likely be adequate, but the IDI (in-direct injection) causes the motors to run a little hotter than the direct-injection.    The diesel is heavier that the SB that you have now. You could get by with your factory springs, but it will ride lower and have a little more sway from the front end. I recommend replacing the coil springs (2wd) or the torsion bars (4wd). yes you could crank up the torsion bars to gain back your ride height, but you still have the same spring rate so get new bars while your at it. You could also steal the springs/bars from the donor vehicle if available.    The easiest way to do this swap would be to get ahold of a donor vehicle. That way you have everything necessary simply because it came from the factory and ran. You can piece it together fairly easily if you know what your doing.     The newer 6.5L diesels that were electronically controlled will require a little more work but it isn't that much more difficult, just more electrical involved.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Sell it and buy a vehicle with a diesel. You'll save thousands.|`|Cpdyn1M3aa	I agree with Mad Jack.  Too much of a hassle You would have to change the engine, trans, radiator, mounts, computer, harness, front springs etc.....    Then after all of that you would still have to meet emissions and safety for your particular area for the gas motor.    If you really want the diesel suburban, try to find one that came that way and buy it, you will likely come out cheaper in the long run.

VEIkVDtIaa	this is perfectly normal operation.  here's the text from the owner's manual.  Absolutely nothing to worry about    in cold weather the engine is started with the engine starter motor rather than with the integrated motor assist (hybrid).    If the IMA battery is too hot or too  cold, the IMA system limits the IMA  batterys output power to protect the  battery. This disables the IMA assist  and Auto Idle Stop, even though the  Battery Level Gauge may show that  the battery is well-charged.  Therefore, if the motor assist is  frequently used, the battery  becomes hot and starts to limit its  output power.  It takes the IMA system a few  minutes in cold weather to normalize  the IMA batterys output power, and  about 15 minutes in hot weather|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Batteries usually do lose power in cold weather, but this is not a common problem.    Hybrids like the Civic and Prius are tested in cold weather before put into production so I am sure it is not a common problem.

yBc0HJifaa	The correct answer would be that the two vehicles pass each other and make the turn. There would be no need for anyone to yield, flash lights, or anything else.   Do not turn in front of another vehicle. This may get you into an accident and take a court to straighten out. In order to turn in front of each other both would have to be on the wrong side of the lane and then have to make a correction to get back into their lanes.    Let's say the vehicle going South is  1 and the vehicle going North is  2. These vehicles would pass each other and commence a turn. Any vehicles following would have to yield stopping vehicles and legal turns.   As vehicle  1 and  2 pass each other and turn they would have to then yield any vehicles that was behind the other.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	It depends on who gets there first and where each car is turning. Sometimes on busy roads, that can cause congested in the turning lane or median and even a head on collision if nobody is paying attention. I've had a few conflicts with cars in the turning lane before. Like I'm about to get in the turning lane and am about half way in the turning lane (or sometimes fully in the turning lane), then a car from the other direction gets in the turning lane and in my way. If the turn is a little father and I'm not fully in the turning lane, I usually swing back out in the left lane, go passed the car, and then get back in the turning lane in front of where I'm turning. It's important to watch people's turn signals from the other direction before getting in the turning lane and don't get in the turning lane 1/2 mile before your turn.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Since no one will know what the other will do I would flash my lights and give the other one the right of way but if that does not work then they should pass each other making sure that they have cleared and then make their left turns....

What your asking for is a bit contradictory.  Long treadlife combined with high performance capability is hard to come by.    For example, if you want a tire that really sticks like glue around corners then you could do far worse than the Dunlop DZ101.  But whatever wear you get out of those is what you get - no mileage warranty - and don't even think about driving them in cold weather or snow.    The Bridgestone Potenza RE960AS Pole Position will get you all-season capability and a 45k mile treadwear warranty in a tire with good dry grip and steering response, but not as good as the aforementioned Dunlop.    The Kuhmo Ecsta LX Touring has the longest treadwear warranty you are going to find in this size - 60k miles - but isn't up to the same standard as the first two options in terms of handling capability.    Bridgestone's Potenza G019 provides a good balance of wear,  handling and multi-season ability with a good mileage warranty of 50k miles, and a reasonable price.  Perhaps something like that works best?

vqUVWPBAaa	I do not have an answer for you about where to go for refinancing, however, I would suggest that you try to add another twenty or forty dollars a month extra with your car note. I know someone that got nearly 16% financing on a car last year and decided to add $50 extra with each bi-weekly note and has already slashed 11 months off the life of her loan. By opting to pay every two weeks it is as she is making 13 payments each year instead of 12. The extra cash goes toward the principle, make sure your lender is aware of that. Sometimes these lenders will take the additional payment and take if off the next payment instead.  You pay more interest in the beginning of your loan, good luck.  Maybe you should see if Citi is willing to refinance for you.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Depends on how much your car is worth (check kbb.com). If you still owe more than the car is worth, you will have extreme difficulty finding a lender who be willing to give you a loan for more than the car is worthl. You might have been able to do it last year, but not now in these times of tight credit.    Is suggest contacting the loan company to see if they might be willing to lower your interest rate. It's a long shot but the only shot you have.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Why don't you try your personal bank. Load companies are a rip off. I will tell you something else that may help you. If you are making the monthly payments on time, you are still loosing out. Loan companies and banks set up a payment account with the interest running ahead of the principal. In other words, when you are paying on a loan the first 3 to 5 years of the loan is interest, or in your case the first 3 to 4 years or more. In order to beat this, what you can do is put back some money until you have enough to make an extra payment. Loan companies don't like this because it screws them out of interest. Another thing you can do is make your payments at least one week before the due date and it knocks some of the interest down. What most of the finance companies do is compound the interest on a monthly scale. Even though the payments are already on the books, if you are one day late the interest rate goes up and is tacked on to the running total of the loan. Example: If you owe $10,000.00 and the payments are $350.00 a month and the interest rate, in your case is 18%. Say you are 3 days late with your payment. The interest is not on the $350.00, it's on the $10,000.00, so by being late you end up adding $180.00 back to the $10,000.00, so your payment only covers $170.00 of the payment, not to mention the outstanding interest that has yet to be paid. What I'm trying to say is that after they add back on the $180.00, the regular interest still comes out of the remainder of the payment that you made, so you actually end up paying almost nothing towards the payoff.           Another note for you is refinancing the car will not help that much. I am telling you this from experience. I bought a 1985 Ford Ranger PU new in 1985. I refinanced the truck 5 times and had to pay it off 5 times, so by the time I finally paid it off the last time the truck was worn out and worth nothing. Getting the interest down will help lower the payment, but in the long run, you are going to end up paying more than the car is worth and when you decide to trade it later on, it is not going to even bring enough for a down payment. Keep the loan you presently have and make your payments early like I said before and save up and make extra payments towards paying it off and you can beat some of the interest. Believe me.|`|IscB3Ijzaa	credit unions are much better and more reasonable than banks    the only difference between a bank and a credit union is a bank you are a customer, they make money off of you a credit union you are a member who owns part of the CU, there is no CEO making so much off of you.

lRGfqnYAaa	One is supercharged and has .4 liters more displacement than the other. The LQ1 is a dual overhead cam (DOHC) motor.    Swapping them out? It depends. The 3.4 is .4L smaller in terms of displacement, but its actual physical dimensions might not work in what you're trying to swap it into.    What's the car you're trying to swap out?    At least they're similar.    There's a chance that it might swap directly in, but don't count on it. Most likely you're going to need to do some minor firewall and engine bay modifications, perhaps get a new transmission, and obtain some new engine mounts.    If you have money to spare, I don't see why you wouldn't go for it. Unfortunately, I can't give you a direct answer, since I've never worked on either model previously.    The supercharged six is rated at 225 HP and 265 ft/lbs or torque, while the LQ1 makes 210 HP and 215 ft/lbs of torque. I honestly think that your money would be better spent by having a supercharger kit fabricated for the LQ1 than by swapping in an L61.    edit: I see it can actually be done, and it has. However, I'm not sure on the amount of work it takes to perform.    Here are a few links to help you out:    http://www.clubgm.com/?name=l67swap  http://articles.motorswap.org/cms_articl...

So what you can do is look it up on the internet how fuel injection works   or you could try make one yourself. BUT be careful, this is petrol we are talking about here.|`|Mqs2Y4hJaa	Use an inductive pickup (latched to your ignition wire) for FI control, or (if you've got access to a machine shop) you could attach an add-on cam to the distributor, to control the FI.     In either case you'll still need to make a bypass for full throttle conditions (where you'd want to max out the fuel trim).    You'll need to tweak fuel pressure, injector timing, and injector duration. Having an EGT, and wideband O2 sensor would be good for fine tuning, but it should be possible to wing it (possibly with worse results than a carb).    It's a neat little project, perhaps you can check out some repair manuals from mfgrs that sell FI lawnmowers/leafblowers/etc.?

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	One person mentioned a CRF150, that is much too small for you. Another person suggested a CRF450 and that is just insane. No new rider should be on that bike, you gotta love YA!! I am 5'9" and I felt pretty cramped on my CRF230, but I only used it as a pit bike so that was cool. If you will be trail riding the CRF250X is a far better choice but twice the money so it may not be an option. If finances just don't allow purchasing a $6,000 bike the 230 will be fine. Here is what I did to help the cramped riding position. Get yourself some over sized Pro Taper CR High Bend bars. These are over sized 1 1/8" instead of the stock 7/8" bars. To make them work you can either change the bar clamps or add the adapters. What you want to do is use the adapters since that will raise the bars a bit higher. The combination of the higher bend on the bars and the added height from the adapters will make a big difference. The seat height of the bike really isn't the issue, it is the distance from the pegs to the bars that causes the cramped feeling and this will help a lot. Yes the CRF230F is slow and heavy compared to the CRF250, but it is also much cheaper and easier to maintain. It is a rock solid bike, just don't expect a power house or anything.

The valves are controlled by the cam shaft or shafts; depending on whether you have dual overhead cams or a single cam shaft.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	the lobes on the cam shaft open and close the valves. the pistons compress the air and fuel mixture in the cylinder and force out the  gasses, the pistons are driven by the crank shaft.|`|Fyffqh4Yaa	dunno|`|qOHLsWRkaa	No, the pistons are connected to the crankshaft. A seperate shaft called a camshaft operates the valves. The crankshaft and the camshaft are tied together in different ways, but the timing of this is critical.

Here's mine:<br>  <br>  A good all round blue water cruiser is a full-keeled, cutter-rigged ketch.  Full keel for stability,  Cutter rigged ketch for sail plan versatility in a variety of conditions.<br>  <br>  Size wise, for long distance cruising, you really do want to consider something in the "over 40 foot" size.  You can get away with less but there are comfort and stowage issues to consider.<br>  <br>  Steel makes for a strong boat; not really pretty sometimes but strong none the less.  There's an old adage: "You know why you don't hear any horror stories about steel boats?  That's because nothing ever happens to them."  Not that they can't sink or get dented, but they do stand up pretty good.<br>  <br>  In reality, This is only a vague answer to your question.  There's lots of other things to consider.<br>  <br>  Now everyone else can wade in here and tell you why I'm so wrong.|`|csmEH6qsaa	I believe Tom has a good answer and knows a lot about boating, boats and boaters.  <br>  <br>  If you want a type of boat as an answer - how about a sailboat, they have been working the Atlantic for many years and although not cheap are cheap to operate. Now as to what size and what models depends on how much you wish to  spend and how many people will be making this crossing.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck;<br>   and if you want good answers ask good questions with more info.|`|AA10255553	An ocean crossing is not for cheapskates.

AA11697737	I don't think so, I can remember flying from Aden up to Port Said, and then hops all the way to England in both Piston/prop and Turbo/prop aircraft in 1961.<br>  <br>  Still remember the noise and the fact I was puking most of the way as the aircraft flew right in the turbulence levels.<br>  <br>  Mind you, I was only four.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	It was VERY expensive to fly in the 1960s>  a coach ticket for a typical domestic flight was the equivalent of about a $1000 today.  Thus, only the rich and business travelers flew on a regular basis.  In fact, there was a term coined in the late 1950s the "jet set": people who could afford to fly everywhere they wished to go.  The airlines also helped with this aura: full course meals served on china (not just 1st class), free drinks-free snacks in the waiting lounges.  As others have mentioned the flight attendants were specifically selected for their appearance, and had designer uniforms.  <br>  By the 1970s, costs had come down with de-regulation, and average guys like us started flying-more flights, fewer perks<br>  The closest equivalent today was the experience of traveling on Concorde. (Which in itself was a catering to the affluent traveler-one of the things that killed the program eventually)|`|EooU3QGnaa	Agree with Sasa, my dad was a corp pilot for his whole life and the 60's were the bomb. He used to take the corp plane down to the Baja and set up air strips so when the boss went on vacation he had a place to land- also got to fly with all the movers of the day including Charles Lindbergh, Guy Lombardo, Kaiser, and did test pilot the C-119. <br>  <br>  Now a days, your a driver  and don't get to go camping with the Bechtel's|`|z3BxHrMpaa	the link  below is to a Pan Am promotional film on their new 707 service.<br>  <a href="http://www.alexisparkinn.com/photogallery/Videos/2007-10-1-PANAM707-1958.wmv" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexisparkinn.com/photogaller...</a><br>    <br>     Airline travel was out of the financial reach of most people, but the airlines pampered those that could afford it.  Check out the level of service they  offered.|`|de0bafb2871861cb5561ee67873a7109aa	Not sure about glamourous, but flying in Southeast Asia in '67-69 was definitely exciting.............|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	It was a lot more glamorous than it is today. Nowadays airport terminals remind me of greyhound stations.|`|FG248uVsaa	Yes. It was still quite a major event to go flying - in the 1950s and 1960s, holidays became more affordable and travel expenses were cheaper. Also, the idea of being able to travel to various exotic locations by aeroplane was very exciting, because before the war, only the very wealthy could afford to fly. It became more within the means of people, but was still expensive enough for a lot of people to feel that air travel was beyond their means.<br>  <br>  Also, being an air stewardess was one of the few "glamorous" jobs that was considered acceptable in those days for a girl to aspire to. The uniforms were by leading designers such as Pucci (for Braniff), and even 1960s Barbie had her own air stewardess uniform as one of her first professions.<br>  <br>  These days, when everyone and their next door neighbour has been on a plane, and has heard horror stories about lost luggage or hijackings, it seems a lot less glamorous because everyone can do it now. That's the point really - once everyone has access to something, it doesn't seem quite so glamorous any more.|`|9AliuxZcaa	well yes, I'm sure comfort levels have increased somewhat. But the glamour was in doing something that was a luxury, that not many people could afford to do.<br>  <br>  Like now, if people were to fly to the moon for space holidays, only a select few could afford it, and it would be the height of glamour, but in 100 years time, when you can get there in 2hrs, and wherever you go is over run by chavs (see Spain et al, now) then the glamour goes|`|jvBWgajuaa	very
cYMeZ5CBaa	First of all...how old are you?  The only reason I ask is because, in most states, if you're under 25 your insurance premiums are going to be out of control.  Now add a Mustang to your policy.  I just hope you can afford the insurance after the purchase.  I would look into the TC a little more.  That's a great little car.  It has a Camry engine and is very responsive and has a ton of neat options.  Toyota has great reliability.  Your premiums for that would probably be half of what they are if you went with the mustang.  Whatever you end up choosing, good luck and congratulations!!|`|znLzOCHlaa	Mustang|`|mTwn8p79aa	Without doubt, the scion.

3mo8vrpTaa	Open your hood and locate transmission.  Easy enough!  on top you will see(can't remember if you have to remove breather first or not)a leaver with a cable that should be attached to it. It is probably broken at that end or under your gear shifter.  using some pliers you can move that leaver all the way back. This will put the car in neutral and then the car will start. Move it two clicks up from park and you will have neutral, you can now push?tow the car if need be. Now the neutral safety switch is preventing the car from starting.  If the cable has become detached due to loosed nut, broken cotter pin etc maybe you can see this and fix it yourself! If everything is fine at the trans. remove the console between the seats and check out the cable connection at the shift lever.  A bit oversimplified but that is the gist of how to fix.|`|AA12181625	shift cable is broken or the shaft it connects too.hope its just the cable
jW8nfcA6aa	Tires are made of varying materials and are guaranteed for mileage that coincides. Like your first answers say, keep checking them on a regular basis. Also look at the indicator bars on the tread. There are random bars that connect the tread lines in the grooves. When these bars touch the road the tire is done. Your tires don't have very many years of exposure to the Sun, but that causes weather checking on the sidewalls which can get unsafe.|`|DV4xyeChaa	i hate saying it but depends...on brand,,,type,,,,hardness of tire... performance tires are softer to grip and a good set will wear out on 20K   touring tires can usually go 60K...at 74K u may as well be shopping for new before you get stuck and end up buying tire[s] you don't want...try Tirerack.com   or discount tire.com|`|nAK8bm91aa	Technically, depends on the tire, technically, see the numbers 300, 460 so on on the tire these numbers correspond with how long a tire should last.|`|evK3hMEbaa	check for blisters,wire showing,but should be changed soon|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Depends on the tire and how well you follow proper maintenance procedures like tire rotations, inflation checks, wheel alignments, etc.<br>  <br>  Tires depending on brand and model can have anything from a tail light warranty to a milege warranty of 100,000 miles and everything in between.<br>  <br>  In short, there is no such thing as average.
RbsRpcIyaa	"I don't need a car right this instant, and will continue my search." - Probably the wisest statement you typed here.<br>  <br>  CarMax is notorious for not budging on price. Their angle is "simplicity". You come in, you like the car, no need to haggle. You either buy it or you don't. Works for them, apparently. <br>  <br>  Keep researching, and keep up what you're doing. Keep going 'til you find the deal and dealer you're comfy with.|`|euXfb9aGaa	Apparently, you seem to completely fail at grasping something.<br>  <br>  Edumunds, Kelly, and Nada DO NOT MATTER.<br>  <br>  Carmax can ask 10,000$ more than the "book value" of a vehicle. That is their right to do. <br>  <br>  Just like private owners have a huge tendency of asking significantly more for their own vehicles, compared to book value.<br>  <br>  The book, since you somehow neglected to notice, are GUIDES. Not set in stone values; nor are they anything that is required to be followed.<br>  <br>  If I have a $500 heap, and I want to list it for $5,000, I can do so. You can look up whatever book you want, and I don't have to budge on my price at all.<br>  <br>  Don't like it? Don't buy it.<br>  <br>  Do you go into a grocery store, with a list of nationwide produce rates, and complain that the store is overpricing broccoli? No? Then get over it.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Gypsy hit it on the head.<br>  <br>  Who says they have to "deal"?<br>  <br>  It's a business. It's not a flea market. Just because car dealerships have a history of negotiating prices, does not make it a standard, or a requirement.<br>  <br>  If you don't like their prices, go elsewhere. It's not a difficult concept.<br>  <br>  Ultimately though, the books are guides. That's all. NADA says that a 1967 GT500 is only worth around $80,000 or so. Funny. I see them going for over $200,000 on Barret Jackson all the time.<br>  <br>  Consumer Guide Auto lists a Geo Metro at $0. Try to convince any owner of one that their car is worth $0, though. <br>  <br>  The car isn't "overpriced". The car is overpriced TO YOU.  To others, it's perfectly priced. To some, it might be a great bargain.<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to rethink whether you really want this car, or if you just want to whine that life isn't fair.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	No, If they sell a car for $15,000, you can't negotiate it. It's the price you see is the price you will pay kind of thing. And I do believe they are overpriced. They say  they inspect, buy and sell high quality cars, give you a history report and things like a 30 day warranty, but I think just a bunch of crap. I could buy a longer warranty and find decent mechanic to check the car much cheaper than what carmax does.|`|mTwn8p79aa	I've been told by friends who bought cars there that they won't deal at all, not even by a dollar, on the price.  But, the price is just one of three things to negotiate on a car purchase.  You've still got financing and trade-in.  If you're paying cash and don't have a trade, you'd be stuck paying their sticker price.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that their prices seem awfully high for an actual purchase price.  They're usually cheaper than the other guys sticker prices but that's not really saying a lot about what I'd pay for a car now is it?  I think it's a good place to go if you don't need the rock bottom price or don't want to handle negotiating.<br>  <br>  If you do have a trade in and you plan on financing, go ahead and give 'em a shot.  If you plan on purchasing their overpriced car you'll have to really beat them up on trade in and financing to make it up though.  Make sure you find out about any "dealer fees" or doc fees or prep fees etc before you buy.  Those are all just profit that should be considered part of the final price of the car.<br>  <br>  The gypsy further down the page apparently has no grasp of how purchasing things goes.  The "guides" are all based on national sales data, based on actual purchase price.  There's a little more science to it than putting a price in a book.  KBB private party is actually a pretty good estimate of what a vehicle is worth on the open market.  <br>  <br>  So, yes, you can price a vehicle at whatever price you want but what it's worth is what someone will pay for it.  It would be completely rational to say "that broccoli is outrageously overpriced.  I'm going to the store across the street."|`|cVuaHBWPaa	In this economy,here is what you do. Make an offer,then walk away. Tell them this is what you are going to pay,and that's all.(Don't forget the tax,title,and license.) My boss did that with a boat he found,around October,or November. They've still got the boat,today.|`|WHDQ068iaa	every car at carmax is overpriced!  they brainwash everyone with the no haggle no hassle prices!  everyone that has pruchased a car from there has been raped!!  hahahahahah..  IDIOTS!|`|ulxe0jPZaa	I understand that they do not deal........... I too believe that their prices are way too high.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Yes, their used cars are always overpriced and they have a reputation for it. <br>  Believe it or not, some people love CarMax because you don't have to negotiate.  The problem is that you can go anywhere and pay over retail without negotiating. <br>  <br>  CarMax is great at their marketing and will not negotiate.  <br>  If you are willing to do a little research, you can get a better deal at a traditional car dealer.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I think it is pretty clear in all of these answers that they will not negotiate.  Period.  They will not drop the price of their car and will not increase the price of your trade. <br>  In their own words, That would make them a "traditional car dealer".

AA10137828	Timing belts offer no warning before they fail. That is why regular replacement is necessary.<br>  <br>  <br>  The rest of your description leads me to suspect a vacuum leak, quite possibly at the intake manifold near #4 cylinder. It could also be a dirty throttle body plate and/or IAC motor or valve.<br>  <br>  While it is running rough, spray some carb cleaner around the intake manifold gasket at the head area, and around the throttle body. You can also clean the throttle body plate with it as well. There is a special cleaner for the throttle body that supposedly wont harm the coating on the plate. That coating is supposed to keep deposits from forming, but I wouldn't worry about that.
