Well my plan expires in Jan, so I have some time.... but what i really want is the duel slid phone.  ( I have atnt) I would like something like this  http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-s...  but I checked it out at one of their stores and it feels so cheap, If i where to drop it it feels like it would break in half! so i love that style but not that phone..... i also really like this one  http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-s...   but its a bit pricey and I'm not really looking for anything to technical.   The things i do most is text message, take pictures and videos.  I could care less about going online and all that.  so if anyone knows of a good phone particularly in that kinda of style ( duel slider) or if atnt will be coming out with something like that in the near future i would really appreciate it.

I've always heard it takes more electricity to re-start a TV than to just leave it on if you are going to restart in short time.

20081123133227AAwcVVB	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Tracfone won't charge--why?	I bought a new Tracfone at a cheap price about six months ago. I hadn't even opened the package until today. I put the thing together and tried to charge the battery, but the thing won't charge at all. The phone screen is blank. Dead. I took the battery and little card out of the back of the phone and put them back in numerous times, tried to charge over and over. Still nothing. The outlet I used does work. I just used it to charge my iPod Touch today.      The Tracfone site is of NO help. I don't want to call their customer service because I have never received useful help from calling a customer-service number at any company. It always ends up being a frustrating waste of time that makes me wish I hadn't bothered to call.       I'm at the point where I feel like just throwing the phone in the trash (I don't have the receipt, it was bought six months ago, and it cost only $10 anyway). Any suggestions on how to get it to work, aside from buying new parts? It is not worth putting actual money into, IMO. If there's a simple fix, then I'll try that. Otherwise, the trash can awaits.  And, since I will NEVER buy from Tracfone again, can anyone recommend a good prepaid phone that's easy to use? I don't make or receive many calls.       Unless I'm somehow doing something wrong, I assume the charger and/or phone must be defective. Like I said, on a $10 item that looks like a cheap piece of junk anyway, it isn't worth replacing the parts.

When I signed up for my cell phone service the sales person put in the wrong social security number as the account holders. So even though its my name on the account it has someone else's social security. I am not getting the benefits of paying the bill on time since the social is someone else, to top it off the phone company is refusing to change the social security mistake [I so tired of the run around]. So if cut of service will my credit report be punished or the other persons?

How does this work ?      You buy the phone , open it up , then what ?      1.Do you have to charge it for 8 hours first ?      2.Does it come with a card with the 300 minutes ?      3.Or are the minutes already on the phone ?      4.When adding minutes on the phone from a card , is it simply just adding the card number then the minutes are added automatically?      5.Or do you have to wait for the minutes to be added ? How Long ?      6. Or do you have to go thru a bunch of menu options and wait for an operator to add a card ?      I doubt I am going to be using these features listed below , but how do they charge you , when they do not have any of your information ?   ? 5￠ per text message   ? 10￠ per minute nationwide   ? 15￠ for International calls per minute   Do they just deduct it from your minutes somehow ?      Nationwide means just OUTSIDE of your state ,right ?      Seems like a good deal.      Thanks       http://walgreens.shoplocal.com/walgreens...
