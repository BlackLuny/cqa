20090202171708AAMnUV4	Computers & Internet;Security	When an item is scanned in a store, does it have an individual label?	I ask, because I recently saw a scam where a guy will buy an item, bring it out to his car and hold onto to the receipt. Then he has a friend go get the same item and put it in a place where he can easily access it. The first guys then goes back into the store with his receipt, picks up the identical item, and returns it. I saw the cashier scan the item, which leads me to believe that scanning only does some sort of counting for inventory, but isn't specialized to each individual item. Is this correct?

I've tried everything on the powerpoints and course documents given to us via blackboard but nothing is working so far.      Also the answer needs to be displayed in a listbox underneath it but I know how to do that...just have to get the solutions.

20090202144724AAg63o8	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How can I create a custom dialog box in Visual Basic that will return a string to a variable?	I'm writing a program in Visual Basic, and need to have a dialog box similar to the InputBox function, but with a few differences.  I started by creating a form with an OK button and a text box.  I have a public function in a module that looks like this:      Public Function InformationBox(strText as String, strFormCaption as String) as String      frmInfoBox.lblText.Text = strText   frmInfoBox.Caption = strFormCaption   frmInfoBox.Show      End Function      Anyway, I would call the InformationBox function like this in my code:      strFirstName = InformationBox("What Is Your First Name?", "Name")      When I do this, the dialog box shows up correctly.  However, I do not know how to pass on the string from the Text Box (txtTextBox) on the  dialog through to the InformationBox Function.   What I mean by this is when I call the InformationBox like mentioned above, how does strFirstName get the result from the InformationBox Function (like it would if I did this: strFirstName = Inputbox('What is your name?","Name").      The only thing I could think of was on the ok button on the dialog form, have this code:  InformationBox = txtTextBox.Text .  However, I got an error saying I didn't give any of the parameters for the InformationBox function (the Text or Caption).      I'm stumped!  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

20090202173749AAFSvkT	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Business information systems questions?	true and false questions      Object types correlate the real world to the conceptual world and serve as a foundation for the entity-relationship (ER) modeling grammar.      2. The source of integrity constraints are the business rules that emerge from the user requirements specification for a database application system.      3. The unique identifier of the entity type can be used to identify an entity distinctly from other entities in the entity set.      4. An entity type where the entities have independent existence is referred to as a weak entity type.      5. Some base entity types may have more than one unique identifier, called candidate key.         6. Unique identifiers are identified in ER-Modeling by an underline in Crow-feet model.         7. Conceptual modeling is a heuristic process, as opposed to a scientific process, and is therefore intuitive and iterative in nature.      8. A business rule states that a given employee MIGHT be supervised—but there may be only one supervisor per employee; this means there is a mandatory 1-to-many relationship in the ER diagram.      9. A business rule states that a plant must have three or more buildings, in addition to a plant name, number, and budget, so Building entity has one-to-one mandatory relationship.

20090202174316AALz9p5	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Please help out with wireless router WRT160-n(linksys)?	Hello everyone. I need a little help getting an internet conection with my new router. I share a house with 4 roomates. We have optimum online cable connection. There are 3 laptops and a PS3 upstairs on the 2nd floor. Now, in the basement we have a dell desktop computer where the connection is placed. I had an old wireless linksys router also but the wires burned out and it got messed up.    So, I bought a WRT160-N linksys wireless router. I am an invoice on these things and none of our computers nor ps3 have n compatibiality. But the guy told me that it also works with G connection too. Now, I installed the CD-Rom on the basement computer, and followed the setup instructions however it just says a connection cannot be established. But, when I turn on my laptops and connect to the network it connects but the internet does not work. The signal strength is excellent but no internet works. It says 802.11n. I am thinking that nothing works because it is an n-connection. But, don't these n-routers give out G signals too? Am I connecting everything wrong? Do I need an adapter? And lastly, would my PS3 work with an internet connection?    Thank you very much

20090202175904AAP74Cx	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	How does facebook benefit from this application? ?	On facebook i've recently been invited to the 'Opinion' application where friends can compare you to other friends and in turn you can do the same.    But I don't find it necessarily flattering that some of my friends seem to think that I'm more bed-worthy than their other friends.      So I was wondering if facebook benefitted by creating social drama between its users? Thus generating a greater amount of time spent on the site? (I say this because a user can also submit gossips about their other friends?) I was wondering if others thought this conclusion was accurate?      Different opinions would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.

Okay, when I first put my computer together, I installed windows XP on a 250GB partition of my hdd, leaving another 250GB for Vista. Now that I am used to vista and everything, I went ahead and used the Vista boot disc to delete the Windows XP partition and then I exited. Well now when I turn on my computer it gives me some message saying "restart or choose correct boot device" or something like that. I have all of my stuff on Vista and I cannot reformat. Is there a way that I can make it boot into Vista instead of that message?? It's extremely important that I have an answer please!?!?! Thanks in advance.       Oh and P.S., I have my boot priority as DVD ROM drive first, then my Hitachi 500GB Sata HDD next. So my boot priority is fine. I just need to know how to get it to boot into Vista now.       There is also now an empty 250GB space on my HDD which I am guessing the computer reads first and sees that it's empty and then does nothing about the other partition.

I plan on keeping the processor for the fact that it preforms a bit better than some dual core one. Am I right when I say this..? If not, please provide suggestions. My RAM is maxed. I can hold no more.    I want to do these things:      - Get a new case for a rather larger gfx card   --> I am looking at the Antec 900... That airflow is just remarkable. Suggestions wanted on regards to the case. Should I get it? Should I not? I value the opinion of the experienced.         - Get a new PSU (Please list both 500W and 600W ones or other suggestions you feel are applicable)   --> I want a good one that won't send my processor and computer straight to the grave. It also needs at least 4 SATA power units. I would prefer to avoid molex to sata adapters.       - A GPU (gfx) card.   --> Suggestions wanted.      Links are a nice touch. If not, I can look it up myself. If you actually have this motherboard you opinion is highly valued. I am really leaning towards that Antec 900 case. If it will fit my mobo all is appricated.      Here is a link to the manufacturers website and the mobo itself.:    http://www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWebSite/Product...       Opinions are extremely valued.

So if I can have the game and remain 16 then that's awesome!   But I don't have the game anymore... And I have to fake my age.   :{      This happen to any of you? What shall I doooo?
20090202180727AAJlCO5	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Connected to the internet, but can't acess anything?	Yeah.. Im connected to the internet but browser. msn and all that doesn't work.. It happened last night and still doesnt work, the only way my router and modem will work with the internet now is if i plug ethernet cable into my modem, and the other end into my PC. Then internet works fine, but not wirelessly to my laptop.. Ive tried EVERYTHING, i'm currently on the phone with HP. Ive called my ISP, router and modem manufacturer.. My ISP told me to connect ethernet into my PC to make it work, and for wireless I call my router manufacturer. after talking to them they said they couldn't help me because it's my laptop's problem that I cant get on the internet on there, on my laptop it also detects my network, shows im connected but STILL can't acess the internet.. I'm on hold because the tech support guy couldnt even help me!! He had to go find a solution so he put me on hold.. I have a feeling it won't work, WTF is going on it was fine last night.. I didn't touch anything, when i try to diagnose the problem on my laptop its a DNS error.. WTF, this is getting EXTREMELY annoying.

20090202182000AAuo1Dv	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Windows Explorer stops responding when I open folders in my music Folder?	There is something terribly wrong with my laptop. Sunday night It would either not boot and be stuck on the vista loading screen, or i could log in and whenever I tried to do or click anything on the desktop the system would just crash and become totally unresponsive.      Today I started it in safe mode and did a system restore, but before that it said i had corrupt files and needed to cure this first, so i ran the diskcheck program, and it said it had fixed some problems. It wouldn't let me do the system restore still because it still said I had corrupt files, but it seems to have solved the problem of me not being able to log on.       There are however, still some lingering problems. Firstly, I keep getting an error message about Windows search Protocol being disabled and stopping working over and over again. Secondly, when I go into individual artists folders within my music folder, it gives me the "windows explorer has stopped working and will restart" message. It does so, but this happens every time i try and get into my music. I keep on getting sluggisg responses and other weird messages as well. Does anyone know how to address these problems? Thanks and sorry for the long read.

I did a virus scan on my computer, and it showed that there was indeed a trojan virus. I tried to go into my rescue and recovery to restore my computer to previous settings, but that was somehow interrupted. Now it says my system32 is corrupted/missing files and I cannot even get to my desktop. When I try to get into my rescue and recovery again, it says i need a password. so I type in my password but it says it's wrong/not configured every time.      Can I just go buy windows xp and try installing it again? I'm assuming it's more complicated than that, but I wanted to check.      If i do reinstall windows, can i just put in the cd and let it go to work? just like that?

In libraries and schools they tend to just have screens instead of the actual computer there. Where you have your log-in and password that they supplied you with, and you sign in. Like, the monitor is connected to a server, and not a seperate machine.      How can I create on of those? I want to build a home server the same way, connected to 4-6 screens. Please tell me the software/OS/Hardware I will need!      (Q6600 @ 3.0ghz - 5GB DDR2 800Mhz - 1TB HDD is the machine I can build.)

What i want to know is, is there a function or a formula in excel that will allow me to change a cell colour (blue for example), and subtract any and all blue cells in a row from a total?      So if cell b2 had 2; c2 had 4; d2 had 2; e2 had 6 and f2 had 5 and I coloured cells b2 & e2 blue, they would be subtracted from the "total" cell in h2. In other words, ignoring all cells that are coloured blue. giving a total of 12 instead of 19. Any of the cells from b2 - f2 could be coloured blue.      This is my problem, can anybody help?!      Thanks in advance.

I went to format Vista (i formatted the partition, then deleted it and reallocated the space, i realise i didn't have to delete it..not sure why i did it) Anyway,  as i press Vista on the Boot Selector i get an error saying something about winload.exe, it also asks me if i have plugged in any new media devices (which i haven't)      If i have my Vista disc in it skips the boot selector and loads vista straight up (i am not booting from the disc but because i have a disc in there it skips the boot selector) i was thinking of going to the repair console and doing fixmbr and seeing if that did anything, unless anyone can suggest something i can do. Also i have tried repairing it with the vista disc and it does not find a problem      help would be much apprecieted thanks!

If the String’s length is already at least as long as the length parameter, your method should return the original string.

At first I thought it was a problem with my sound card, but I found that when I went to other websites the sound worked perfectly (even sites using flash, so I know it can't be a flash problem). It's also annoying because Pandora also works on all of my other computers except the one I NEED it to work on! I'm currently using Firefox, although I'm experiencing the same problems on this computer no matter what web browser I use (Opera, Chrome, etc...). Any advice?

20090202192208AAJ0EvK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	What laptop would be good for running design software?	Hi I am sitting NCEA Level 3 graphics this year (Last year of High School) and I have looked at what the years work is made up of and I think it would be a very good idea to get together a decent laptop and put design software on it. I want the sort of thing where you can make 3D objects and logos/labels. So, What brand or make of laptop would be best for this (Would like links) and what programs can you recommend that would help me.      Example our first project is designing the name, logo, uniforms etc for a airline company. I even have to do baggage labels and nametags.      Last project is to design an entire waterfront, eg. shops, piers, momuments, docks, paths. All 3D.      Thanks alot.
