qpkXD4RCaa	Well, I don't think there are any completely safe appetite suppressants. (I could be wrong but I don't recall anything that is "effective" and is completely safe.)  But from what your saying instead of using appetite suppressants I would eat something like peanut butter with celery. The celery has "negative calories" meaning it takes more calories to digest the celery then the actual calories the celery provides, and the peanut butter may be fatty (get low fat peanut butter) but it has a good amount of protein and is very filling. <br>  <br>   The best rule of thumb for losing weight is just to not keep any sweets in the house so you don't start eating them when you get bored. Another cure for your boredom would be to walk/run a mile instead of eating that piece of cake in the fridge. Do that for 3 days and it will get easier, do that for a month and it will be a routine.  Good luck i hope this has helped.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Not a product, but could be worth a try- hypnotherapy.

I was very happy with it!|`|VPlKbDplaa	Try the Ayurvedic herbal Guggul gum (Commiphora mukul) a sticky resin from the Mukul myrrh tree. Its a great herb for health all round.

Guggul has been used as part of Ayurvedic medicine in India for hundreds or thousands of years. <br>  <br>  Sea kelp because it is rich in iodine also supports thyroid function and sea kelp tablets are relatively cheap. You could also try 2 tsp of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water before meals (up to half an hour). Its reputed to help.

If you enjoy eating, as it sounds like you do, you could try replacing more and more food with whole, natural, perhaps raw alternatives, rather than trying to suppress your appetite.

The forcefuleness of air and the heavy vibration you create when speaking up will counteract the shaky voice and your nervouseness will dissipate as well. P.S. Dont stand too close to a mic when using this technique. Also dont yell, just speak up in a commanding tone like a general speaking to his troops.Your information is important.  <br>  Also ten minutes prior to speaking do this. Take a deep breath in and tense your abdomen up. As you let the air out slowly relax your abdomen. Repeat this over and over to help relax any shakiness in your body. Whatever body part feels shaky tense up and release while breathing in and out until that body part is totally relaxed. <br>  Combined these two techniques will help alot ok.|`|0344b14c2b9cf6ff627da4b38cfdcf39aa	These tips are for people who stutter all the time.

I have it and I have a pretty good diet, I do not snack and I eat good whole foods but I can pack on 10 pounds in a week.  I gain it and can lose it very fast. That is how my body is.  The condition makes you tired and feel sick alot too so trying to be active is a challenge.  Not a problem on good days but hard on bad days.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly.

This can be one of the fastest ways to lose weight and keep it off. Stopping and starting on diets and exercise can actually harm your chances. Many people who start with an eating plan and exercise regime and then quit only to start again in a few weeks often gain weight.<br>  <br>  So to have the fastest way to lose weight you must write out your commitment. This will make the idea a fact which is the best way to achieve success. You must give yourself a goal. Putting it in writing cements the idea and you can lose weight faster and keep it off.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join, exercises, workout programs, etc This site also has other people your age that are asking the same questions and facing the same challenges that you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  www.sparkteens.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  w8losschick|`|57Avg06Waa	Do some cardio... run in place, dance, etc. :) And remember, eat healthy.|`|4qzxzmW6aa	Fat Loss 4 idiots or the idiot proof diet details various reasons why most diets are not effective. The main point is that when you are on a diet, you are supposed burn more calories than what you take in. However, your metabolism adjusts to the amount of calories you consume. When this happens your metabolism slows down and that's when you stop losing weight. Fat Loss 4 Idiots asserts that the answer to this problem is calorie shifting.<br>  <br>  By rotating your protein and carbs intake everyday, your body's metabolism increases and this, according to Fat Loss for Idiots, will help you lose weight faster. With a combination of perfect carb and protein, you are allowed to eat four times a day with this diet. This process corrects and regulates your fat burning hormones, thereby helping you quickly and safely lose weight. This ingenious technique is known as the calorie shifting method.<br>  <br>  Weight loss for idiots is where I first started looking for an easy way to lose weight because I became a fat body. My search lead me to Fat loss 4 idiots, which as it turned out was perfect for me. Fat loss for idiots claims you can lose more weight by eating more often. It can also be done in a very simple step by step process.<br>  <br>  The results of weight loss 4 idiots is so tremendous that I lost 7 lbs in just 11 days, the promise was I would lose 9 lbs but the 7 in 11 days result is a huge start. After another 11 day cycle, I lost 6 lbs more. So in 22 days, I lost 13 pounds, which may not be the accurate amount of weight I should have lost in their advertisement, but that's 13 pounds!<br>  <br>  Where most diet plans fail is the fact they dont understand how the metabolism works. Fat Loss 4 Idiots uses basic metabolism facts to develop a solution to the diet problem. You see your metabolism has a memory, but it doesn't know how much food you'll eat tomorrow or the next day. Logically, your metabolism only burns calories based on the meals you've had in the past. Weight Loss for Idiots uses this mechanism to come up with the effective diet plan known as calorie shifting method.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss 4 Idiots shocks your metabolism by doing something you've never tried before. With Weight Loss 4 Idiots, you don't eat the same meals with the same calorie content for a couple of days. Through this, your metabolism no longer has a pattern to follow so it forced to burn more calories efficiently.<br>  <br>  Check out my source link, it might help. Good luck!

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	I had to read your question a few times because I think there is something important in there.  You say that you were off work for 2 weeks.  Was that a vacation/holiday and if so, what did you do?  I ask this because you may have herniated a disc in your neck since that's where the pain started.  This would most definitely give you a headache, change the status of your regular headache and give you a migraine.  <br>  <br>  Basically, there are three types of headaches:<br>  <br>  Regular - stress, tension, hormonal, sinus, etc.<br>  Migraine - dizzy, sick to stomach, sensitive to light and sound, etc.<br>  Cluster - that's when a headache goes on and on for days<br>  <br>  But, like I said, since you mentioned that the pain started in the back of your head, in your neck and then you got a migraine, I would be very tempted to say you may have injured your neck without even knowing it.<br>  <br>  Also, do you know if you grind your teeth at night?  This will also cause neck pain and migraine headache.<br>  <br>  So, I would recommend a trip to the doc to see if you hurt your neck while you were off of work - OR - if you are positive that you did not - I would make an appointment with the dentist to have your TMJ checked out.  If grinding is the problem, this can be very easily fixed with a "night guard."  If you know that you do grind, you can pick up a night guard at any store - Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Take Care!!|`|dr32Mtxdaa	--------- Drnik more water_---------|`|AjM9c5oZaa	Feeling sick and dizzy are common side effects of migraines. <br>  They can be random and come for no reason.<br>  They can be caused by watching to much TV or spending to much time on the computer.<br>  They can also be side effects of certain drugs and medication <br>  or it might be a problem with your eyes.|`|85vaWQebaa	step one: try meditation to confirm if it's stress<br>  step two: drink 2L of water a day and see if it clears<br>  Step 3: try some combo over the counter med that treats bad colds<br>  step 4: you may be addicted to sugar, try eating chocolate when you get them, and see if it clears.<br>  step 5: see a doctor, my 4 step process to IDing the cause has failed.|`|7ki9mfh6aa	the main thing i can think of if its out they are out the blue,<br>  is STRESS!<br>  i didnt think i was either...and i was nauseated, sore and, always tired.|`|hv2nmmrqaa	Could be any number of things, go see a doctor and dont follow any other advice you might get here.

There is no cure but its treatable.  When you have a gout attack, they are usually in the evenings or at night. The pain can get so bad that even something as light as a feather will hurt when it touches the part that's swollen. I ended up in urgent care last week, I thought I had an infection, when the PA said it may be gout I was really taken away. I am 28 year old female and only like 15lbs over my desired weight.  You should be ok, I am waiting on my test results as soon as they get back to me I am going to sit down with my doctor and discusss what needs to happen next. Things like changing my diet.  In the meantime if you do have that swellingagainn, mine was horrible!!  Take 2 aleves, I guess it has to be a NSAID, nonsteroidd antioinflammatory and ice packs.  Anything with heat sucks. I don't think that general rule with gout being in mostly older men is right.  I have been doing research on it too, and have found many women 40 and under with gout.  Best of luck, hope itturnss out well for you :)|`|b6YriDmoaa	i think you sould check what it is you ate....i left info from ask.com to help familiarize you with this condtion...GOOD LUCK..i hope this could help...
2cc75788c0a85d7434cad7a54afd37ecaa	If you're going through the Kressge Eye Institute, you're dealing with world class folk.<br>  <br>  But, a second opinion is always good advice, a third might be overkill...<br>  <br>  On a personal note, my bride had a similar operation back in the days of rusty saw blades. She doesn't have fond memories of the event due to having to stay for several days in the hospital by herself. I'm confident things have changed in that regard, but it is something to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  Now, having had a couple of little ones who spent some time in the hospital I can say that your vibe will go along way in how your little guy prepares for the event. If you are confident and strong and positive, he will be too. Make sure you take him on a tour of the hospital so he gets into the groove about what his digs are going to look like.<br>  <br>  It is natural to be skittish in situations like these, but it is vital that you NEVER EVER reveal to him that you have doubts. No hushed conversations with hubby in the kitchen, because kids will hear you, and do not express doubts to the doctor with your son around. Moreover, tell the Grandparents to keep their opinions out of your house.<br>  <br>  If you don't, bad mojo on the kiddy scene. Fear, second guessing, distrust in you and the doctor. Keep all Anti-Surgery conversation on the QT.<br>  <br>  Remember, this is not just a decision that ends in July, You are making a decision that will impact the next 80 years. How you deal with it will have the biggest influence.|`|p27jMTFuaa	I would take him to an optometrist who specializes in vision therapy.

The surgeries were a horrible experience for me and looking back on it were probably not necessary.<br>  <br>  Please seek a second opinion on the surgery and good luck
YXWmaOryaa	oh I hate going to the docs too but you really have go to go, this could be angina or you could even have had a heart attack. It could also have only been indigestion (I used to work in accident and emergency and you would be amazed at the amount of people coming in with indigestion who thought they were having a heart attack, it can be really painful) Indigestion can be eased with rennies or other over the counter remadies, but again its important not to confse the two as I also worked in a sheltered housing and found a woman who had died from a heart attack & she was clutching a box of rennies, so she had obviously thought that she was only having indigetion...any way the point is only the doc can tell you for sure and with any chest pains you really cant take any chances as undetected probs will just weaken your heart. If it is angina your GP will simply prescribe you with a wee spray and when you feel the pain you just spray a bit on your tounge and this will quickly ease the pain. If you really really dont want to go to the doc then why dont you phone NHS 24? You can describe your symptons (you can even do this on line, heres link below if you dont want to talk to anyone directly) and they will be able to give you a better diagnosis....if you dont want to do any of these then you can discuss your symptoms with your local pharmasist.

sJUhwxBxaa	It depends on what the chemical imbalance is. Some over-the-counter and herbal/supplemental medications claim to help balance things like serotonin, melatonin, and other brain chemicals. Your best bet would be to talk to an open-minded medical professional about your specific chemical imbalance and ask if there are any non-prescription therapies available for your particular condition. Heck, if chocolate can make you happy and turkey can make you sleepy, there has to be some credibility in the "natural" remedies.

AA11693263	It could be a condition called Tourette's Syndrome....Google it and see if this sounds like you. My 15 year old daughter has a mild form of it. But with some of you symptoms it sounds like you could have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It could be either one or even both. So, look them up, see what you think and then take any supporting evidence that you find to your parents and ask them to make a doctor's appointment for you as this is really affecting your life and you feel as if you really need some help to overcome it. <br>  And don't be embarrassed ot ashamed of anything you are going through. We taught our daughter at an early age that she is special and that there is nothing "wrong" with her. She has always been very positive and open about the Tourette's and since it doesn't bother her, it doesn't bother her peers. She has never been teased or made to feel bad for the tics she has. If she is having a bad day, her friends step in to help her out, or if there is a sub at school and she is doing one no one in any of her classes will let them give her a hard time about making her squeaking noises or "making faces" at them. They all are there for her and affectionately have nicknamed her "Twitch" or "Little Twitch". It has never been used as a "bad" name to her. It's just their way of being affectionate and understanding about her condition and she loves it :)|`|0hdAwwWOaa	Take hard showers with extra stuff or go to doc?

You only live once & get one shot why not make it the best you can? Hmm... my reactions to someone changing their appearance would be nothing but supportive! I think everyone has the right to be who ever they want to as long as you don't hurt anyone I say GO FOR IT!!! Make yourself feel good.! W all get bored with ourselves and need to make changes. If you feel strange just popping up on ppl a new version of yourself then try your new look out at the mall or other places that are fairly populated, with the attention you get from looks & second takes you should have the confidence to just do it... Best of luck to you!|`|id3bZ8Hlaa	I would say 'go on girl' enjoy the new you. Life's too short to worry about what other people think or say. Go out there and show you're-self off.

Believe me when I say that everybody is too preoccupied in their own lives to judge you. Besides, society has no control over you and the decisions you make. You have power over your life and why worry what they think if that's the case? They don't follow you home or determine your future. Have faith in yourself and what you stand for. After the first day with your new look, things will get in order. Visualize yourself a a confident human being and strive to attain that imagery. Do not let useless worries get the worst of you.
ksar3NWwaa	You gotta stand up for yourself kiddo.  Bullies don't like a challenge so they look for the "weak link".  If you become more work to bully then it's worth to them they will move on to someone who isn't fighting back. <br>  <br>  Don't get in a physical fight and don't tattle just stand up and give 'em some good attitude!  Be a lion not a lamb and you won't be stalked so much. The more you show them it upsets you the more they win, because upsetting you is what they want and it is their payoff for their work.  If you don't show them you are sad or hurt they will get bored because there is no gain for them to keep on with you.  <br>  <br>  Sarcasim works great or just make fun of them back ..  that will boost your spirit!|`|BXHfVkaJaa	Go to someone.

f8mLpPXlaa	Shortness of breath was once used to describe the way an asthmatic breathed. Because they couldn't take in much air. But now it covers any situation where a patient doesn't feel like they're getting enough air. They could be drawing in plenty of air and filling their lungs but not able to get enough oxygen. Any time a patient feels "air hunger" the doctor needs to track down the cause fast. It could be lungs, heart, diabetic acidosis, a whole plethora of reasons. But just the term "short of breath" is a symptom and not the disease.|`|GCjFPehGaa	yeah like when you're panting.<br>  i get it when my asthma is acting up.<br>  <br>  obese people get it when theyre going up stairs.<br>  <br>  smokers get it when they run.

1h7lAJ8Daa	You don't have serious issues. It seems to me that you have a problem appreciating yourself. In my experience of depression, it really messed up my thoughts, because of it I began to question everything and thought very deeply. It was strange for a 13 year old to consider everything with such thought - it made me feel even more depressed!<br>  <br>  Perhaps you ought to see a doctor who could reccommend a professional to help you overcome your difficulty in forming relationships.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, God Bless and Best Wishes xx|`|YjhlhUzVaa	There is nothing better than to start jogging/running outdoors 30 minutes a day, every day.

I'd talk to your doctor about this before it could get worse, especially since you've had suicidal thoughts. If you have trouble talking to your doctor, print what you just wrote and bring it with you. Also, maybe you could find some support groups in your area that might be helpful.

Do things you don't normally do, lead conversations with people you don't normally talk to, wear things you don't typically wear. Eliminate all repetition from your life and change up your routine.

Just because your major doesn't seem to work for you doesn't mean you can't try to be positive and look at it from a different angle.

723ae3923619bae2900e713f6d216e8eaa	Your main symptoms are; A sore throat, headache, fever and stomach ache after you drink something. A sore throat, fever, and headache are most associated with the common cold, allergies and the flu. Given that it is flu season I would say this is standard for the flu. How long have you had theses symptoms? Have you traveled to another country? Have you been around anyone that has been sick with the flu? The other symptom (stomach ache after drink) is most associated with an ulcer depending on your current age and the amount of carbonated drinks you intake on a daily basis. I would say you have two conditions; the flu and an ulcer based on the symptoms you provided. To make a better diagnosis you would have to provide the above questions and include any medications that you are currently taking. The fever does concern me a bit since I do not know how long you have had the fever. If it has been longer than 2 weeks you would need to consult you doctor. If it has been a few days I would recommend alternating between Ibuprofen and 1000mg-1500mg of Tylenol every four to six hours. Drink plenty of fluids other than carbonated beverages (based on your current stomach problem). I hope this helps..|`|bniWlQ9maa	These symptoms perfectly match those of simultaneous methadone and crack cocaine withdrawals.<br>  <br>  But you'd know what was wrong if that was the case, I'm guessing, so you probably have a combination of any of the following: pharyngitis, bronchitis, & sinus infection.

2sycPf8Daa	Low blood pressure, also called hypotension, would seem to be something to strive for. After all, high blood pressure (hypertension) is a well-known risk factor for heart disease and other problems. In fact, in recent years there has been an ongoing downward revision of what is considered a normal blood pressure reading. A blood pressure less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is now considered normal and optimal for good health.<br>  <br>  So, it's easy to understand why you might assume the lower the better when it comes to blood pressure. And it's true that for some people — those who exercise and are in top physical condition — low blood pressure is a sign of health and fitness. But that's not always the case.<br>  <br>  For many people, low blood pressure can cause dizziness and fainting or indicate serious heart, endocrine or neurological disorders. Severely low blood pressure can deprive the brain and other vital organs of oxygen and nutrients, leading to a life-threatening condition called shock.<br>  <br>  In many instances, low blood pressure isn't serious. If you have consistently low readings but feel fine, your doctor is likely to monitor you during routine exams. Even occasional dizziness or lightheadedness may be relatively minor — the result of mild dehydration, low blood sugar or too much time in the sun or a hot tub, for example. In these situations, it's not a matter so much of how far, but of how quickly, your blood pressure drops. Still, it's important to see your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of hypotension because they sometimes can point to more serious problems. It can be helpful to keep a record of your symptoms, when they occur and what you were doing at the time. If these occur at times that may endanger you or others, you should talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Take care as always!|`|q7JumPqjaa	I have low blood pressure, though my GP didnt mention much about it apart from it may be causing some headaches and making me feel faint. i am underweight m/8stone/5'9'' and that is often a cause.
EdhW394qaa	With every cigarette, you are adding one more day of addiction. With every cigarette, you are adding one more day of cancer causing agents, with every cigarette, you are increasing your fear of quitting!  How much time specifically is nonsense, since it would vary depending on how deep you inhale, how much nicotine is in each cigarette you are smoking...smoking any cigarette is killing yourself. If you don't smoke...please don't start, and if you do smoke...get started on quitting before you smoke another cigarette.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1YdeUn1Caa	That's an old wives tale.<br>  My grandparents are 87 and 83 and have been smoking for over 60 years, with no signs of quitting.<br>  They have smoked alot of cigarette during that 60+ years.

4ZE8RG7Waa	chlamydia is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. Although you may not have heard its name, chlamydia is one of the most common STDs. Because there often aren't any symptoms, though, lots of people can have chlamydia and not know it.<br>  <br>  The bacteria can move from one person to another through sexual intercourse, and possibly through oral-genital contact. If someone touches bodily fluids that contain the bacteria and then touches his or her eye, a chlamydial eye infection is possible. Chlamydia also can be passed from a mother to her baby while the baby is being delivered. This can cause pneumonia and conjuntivitis, which can become very serious for the baby if it's not treated. You can't catch chlamydia from a towel, doorknob, or toilet seat.<br>  You've been very lucky you have found out and can get treated..i would have a very long talk with your husband.|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	Maybe your husband had it before he married you or vice versa... chlamydia can lay dormant for years before you realise you have it as it has no symptons (especially for men).

You're killing me !|`|zAzZ3xcOaa	What is poop made of?<br>      About 3/4 of your average turd is made of water. Of course, this value is highly variable - the water content of diarrhea is much higher, and the amount of water in poop that has been retained (voluntarily or otherwise) is lower. Water is absorbed out of fecal material as it passes through the intestine, so the longer a turd resides inside before emerging, the drier it will be. <br>      Of the remaining portion of the turd, about 1/3 is composed of dead bacteria. These microcorpses come from the intestinal garden of microorganisms that assist us in the digestion of our food. Another 1/3 of the turd mass is made of stuff that we find indigestible, like cellulose, for instance. This indigestible material is called "fiber," and is useful in getting the turd to move along through the intestine, perhaps because it provides traction. The remaining portion of the turd is a mixture of fats such as cholesterol, inorganic salts like phosphates, live bacteria, dead cells and mucus from the lining of the intestine, and protein. <br>  Why does poop stink?<br>      Poop stinks as a result of the products of bacterial action. Bacteria produce smelly, sulfur- or nitrogen-rich organic compounds such as indole, skatole, and mercaptans, and the inorganic gas hydrogen sulfide. These are the same compounds that give farts their odor. <br>  Why is poop brown?<br>      The color comes mainly from bilirubin, a pigment that arises from the breakdown of red blood cells in the liver and bone marrow. The actual metabolic pathway of bilirubin and its byproducts in the body is very complicated, so we will simply say that a lot of it ends up in the intestine, where it is further modified by bacterial action. But the color itself comes from iron. Iron in hemoglobin in red blood cells gives blood its red color, and iron in the waste product bilirubin gives rise to its brown color. <br>  What other colors of poop are possible?<br>      Poop is mostly shades of brown or yellow, but other colors can arise under certain circumstances. For example, someone with a bleeding ulcer might have tarry black poop from the presence of partially digested blood. Bleeding in the intestine, from an anal fissure or split, for example, can stain the poop red. Bloody poop can also be a sign of colon cancer, so you should get it checked out by a doctor if you see blood in your stool. Some illnesses in babies gives them green or even blue-green poop. But another source of blue poop in children is more innocent: it can come from eating a concentrated source of blue food coloring such as ice cream. Intense red food coloring can produce bright red poop. Sometimes brightly colored foods pass through the gut almost unchanged, and the turd may be speckled with bright red fragments such as pimentos, or bright yellow kernels of corn. <br>      Poop can also be stained red if you eat beets, according to Ellen. <br>      One can experience white poop after consuming a barium milkshake for the purposes of getting an x-ray of the upper gastrointestinal tract. <br>  What is the cause of yellow poop?<br>      According to Michael F., one cause of this is Gilbert's Syndrome. "I have a benign condition known as Gilbert's Syndrome. It affects quite a few people, males mostly, in their teens+. It is a deficiency in the liver where red blood cells are broken down. I was informed when this was diagnosed that the broken down blood cells is what gives poop a lot of its color. People with Gilbert's Syndrome don't process as many blood cells - or not as fast - and their poop tends to be pale brown or yellow from the lower quantity of discarded red blood cell matter. This is especially true if there is less matter in your intestines (i.e., on a diet - as I have noticed) to remove the excess blood cells. Very frightening until you determine what is causing it. Gilbert's is a totally benign thing that doesn't harm anyone, although when a person is sick they can turn yellowish as if jaundiced, but it is not jaundice." <br>      Another cause of yellow poop is a giardia infection. Giardia are tiny Protozoan parasites that can invade the intestines and result in severe yellow diarrhea. It is a dangerous and contagious affliction that doctors are obligated to report to the Center for Disease Control. <br>  What is the cause of green poop?<br>      (Question submitted by ap, CrAzYMiC98 and several others) <br>      I have consulted with a doctor, a physiologist and a microbiologist on this question, and the following summarizes their answers: <br>      Healthy people can have green poop if they eat a diet rich in leafy green vegetables, or if they consume large quantities of food coloring (in ice cream, cake frosting etc.). <br>      Green poop can also be caused by excess iron in the diet, from dietary supplements, for example. If the body does not absorb all the iron consumed, the iron may stain the poop green, the color of iron (II) salts. Ordinarily, the green color may be masked by the normal brown poop color, but if digestion|`|mAO4nQXGaa	HAHAHAHA!!!! your kidding right?!? when you start to piss out your *** then you gotta worry.. not the colour!!! hint to you... dont eat bubble gum ice cream it turns your "poo poo" green :)|`|w7vv78Y8aa	baaahahahaa i get points for this.....dude its probably just something you ate.<br>  <br>  my **** has been green a couple of times lol|`|U0Xwvw2Naa	its probably something you ate? lol|`|SsWiDRueaa	Pig!|`|E64juLwJaa	Your brother checks your poo:how does he know it is lighter then usual? weird<br>  Colors.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	that ACTUALLY made me laugh.

aHPDAqw0aa	BREAK UP WITH BOTH OF THEM!! Quick girl before you get yourself into more trouble, then go straight to the police station and get what is called a No Tresspass Order...you don't have to have any reason to get it and it is immediately enforced. It sounds like your currant boyfriend is very violent so this will keep him in check. What it does is it won't allow him to come to any property you list (your home, your grandparents house etc...anywhere you are at a lot) and it is delivered by a police officer. It is the easy light version of a restraining order, those usually take a long time to get but this will give him the hint to stay the hell away and if he does step foot on your property to harass you then call the police and he will be taken immediately to jail if you have that ( I had a crazy ex so I know what its like ). No matter how much you like him, no guy should ever say that stuff to you and he sounds way too dangerous (might be abusive to you in the future). Definitely go with the sweet guy.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	god dam it those boys r just giving u confusion which means there they r not good bf's! so just **** it all up and leave boys away from ur life! ur better of without them!|`|VkC3NfMIaa	Wow, you guys are REALLY fuuuckkedd uppp.|`|wS0tZzFIaa	jesus christ superstar your life is a mess. <br>  really, my advice is to stay away from guys for a while. seriously. and your number 1 bf (can't believe you both have two people that you're with btw) seems like a douche.

Speak to your doctor, you'll probably be told of any possible conditions.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	They are looking to see what is causing your problems. You may have a deviated septum, nasal polyps or chronic swelling, which would cause your issues to become worse. If there is something blatantly wrong, they may go ahead and do surgery, but the goal is to cure you without surgery. The CT Scan just gives them an idea of what is wrong with you and how to treat it.<br>  <br>  Generally, what they do is do a Sinus CT when you first complain about symptoms, then give you a 4-6 week course of max treatment, then do another Sinus CT to check everything again, since the swelling should have gone down.<br>  <br>  The symptoms that you have indicate Chronic Sinusitis. My guess is that you already have bad allergies, which is common in people that suffer from Chronic Sinusitis. They will probably put you on some strong antibiotics, along with a nasal wash and allergy meds. <br>  <br>  Don't take any allergy meds the day you do the CT, because it could take away some of the symptoms that they need to see to diagnose you. <br>  <br>  I have terrible allergies myself, and am also in this process. My doctor has suggested sinus surgery, as my sinuses are so congested that I have Sinus Infections almost every month, and chronic undereye circles from it [note, undereye circles are common in people with the condition because congested sinuses prevent the blood vessels under the eyes from draining properly]<br>  <br>  No worries, it will go by very quickly, and as a result, your doctor will be able to help you get better.|`|rypsRNs0aa	Seems like it, me and you both, my appointment is not due for a couple of weeks to see a specialist. On top of your symptoms, I cant open my mouth properly, the cheekbone hurts as well. there might be fluid in the Sinuses but at this stage I don't want to know, what is going to happen. So good luck to you and me
3ea5199bfc214dd30a610b6a9a12f8e4aa	That's what your Dr is looking for.  The pressure/congestion/dizziness etc are all symptoms of a sinus condition.  With the CT, the boney compartments of your sinus' will be visualized as well to make sure they are intact as well as the mucousal membranes.  If there is fluid in your sinus' the CT will help your Doc help you feel better and get rid of all that crap in your head.  Good luck...|`|f8mLpPXlaa	That's what he's trying to find out whether it's an infection or an anatomic malformation. It could be your upper teeth infringing into the sinus. All this he can tell from the ct. <br>  God bless and help you feel better soon.
3ea5199bfc214dd30a610b6a9a12f8e4aa	Could be muscle spasms...have you changed any meds that you should be taking?  Have you started taking new meds?

Add a little more water to your diet and they will go away.  Not enough water can also cause muscle cramping.
CnSaGHqWaa	With out any lubrication the process is slightly more difficult but do-able. I start by inserting a moistened finger into my woman's anus, going in and out shallow for a few minutes, once she has loosened up I go a little deeper (keep in mind my urge is to always go in deep quickly), keeping the pace slow. Fact is; she will let me know by her gyrations whether or not I should go deeper or not. When she has motion that says she wants more I move to two fingers (this could take 10 to 20 minutes it really depends on her). And I repeat the insertion technique again and until, her motions tell me she is ready to have my penis inserted. By far and absolutely the best for a man, is to start the slow shallow process with the penis. And again the woman's motion will tell if it's right to go in all the way. I'm not sure what your problems are with lubrication, they do make specific lubes for anal penetration and if it's a germ issue there is actually disinfectant toy lubes that have flavors for those of us that enjoy analingus. What ever the case try to have fun always, if it hurts stop and enjoy the many other ways to orgasm.|`|df34764553e8d420f118831a85c7a11eaa	why are you embarrassed to use lube, just bring it out and ask him to use, it isn't that big of a deal.

Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|H2IqzG12aa	Lube shouldn't be out of the question.  Even ordinary petroleum jelly will work, since it liquefies at body temperature.  Probably the best thing to do is to push out during penetration, since that opens and relaxes your anus while stiffening the wall of your rectum. It's counter-intuitive, since your butt wants to clamp down and resist being entered. Other than that, just take your time and give your body time to adjust to being penetrated.|`|AA10350894	I am with Nonya, why is lube out of the question?<br>  Lube would make the act of anal sex all the more enjoyable for both you AND your partner! Especially if you use condoms, which you should be doing!<br>  As far as loosening up is concerned, you could always insert a comfortable but plug a half hour to forty five minutes before the actual sex, or insert it while still in the midst of for play.

Leave it on at night while you sleep and wash off immediately upon waking. Steam face for twenty more minutes in the morning after washing. When you finish steaming your face splash your face with cool water and dry it.<br>  <br>  If your skin starts to show any signs of a pimple forming. Take one night off from steaming and applying castor oil and apply<br>  Benzoyl Peroxide over face.<br>  <br>  Take the next night off also from the steaming, castor oil, and benzoyl peroxide. Continue facial regimen with steaming and<br>  castor oil the following night.<br>  <br>  This  will moisturize your face at the same time it will help clear up acne and pimples.

It shows more appreciation towards him (As strange as that sounds).<br>  Admittedly, I know it wouldnt taste too well, but then again, ive heard so many of my male mates say how much they dislike giving head to woman, knowing what has gone on down there.<br>  <br>  Its a "Give n Take" Thing!!!<br>  <br>  Remember, you dont have to suck all the way down his shaft!<br>  Some girls are just lucky to not have a gag reflex. The other 99% cant do what pornstars can.<br>  <br>  Tip: Take a Shower together, so you are both nice n clean (mental advantage knowing eachother smell good etc) that way it will trick your body to know it smells good, not bad n you wont gag.<br>   Use alot of tongue around the head of his dick.<br>  Lick everything, so much that you have lubed his entire ****, and then **** while sucking on his head.<br>  <br>  Big or Small dick, you man wont have the Head of a Melon, and any girl can fit a lollipop in her mouth. Thats all it is. Head in Mouth, flicking n trying new things with ya tongue...even consider getting your tongue pierced? He could do the same? I have mine done, n my girl NEVER complains.<br>  <br>  Remember, he will blow, and it may taste bad?

For unknown reasons, pregnancy decreases breast tissue susceptibility to somatic mutations; thus, the earlier the first pregnancy, the shorter the susceptibility period.<br>  <br>  Hereditary breast cancers have been thought to represent a small proportion (5-10%) of all breast cancers. However, based on new data derived from the comparison of identical and nonidentical twins, up to 27% of breast cancers may be attributed to inherited factors. The mutated genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for approximately 30-40% of inherited breast cancers.<br>  <br>  The prevalence of BRCA1 in the general population is 0.1%, compared with 20% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The gene is encountered in 3% of the unselected breast cancer population and in 70% of women with inherited early-onset breast cancer. Up to 50-87% of women carrying a mutated BRCA1 gene develop breast cancer during their lifetime.<br>  <br>  Risks for ovarian and prostate cancers are also increased in carriers of this mutation. BRCA2 mutations are identified in 10-20% of families at high risk for breast and ovarian cancers and in only 2.7% of women with early-onset breast cancer. The lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in female carriers is 25-30%. BRCA2 is also a risk factor for male breast cancer; carriers have a lifetime risk of 6% for developing the cancer. BRCA2 mutations are associated with other types of cancers, such as prostate, pancreatic, fallopian tube, bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and basal cell carcinoma.<br>  <br>  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by a mutation of TP53, is associated with multiple cancers, including the SBLLA syndrome (sarcoma, breast and brain tumors, leukemia, laryngeal and lung cancer). Cancer susceptibility is transmitted by an autosomal dominant pattern, with penetrance approximating 90% by age 70 years. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is identified in 1% of women with early-onset breast cancer. Bilateral breast cancer is noted in up to 25% of patients.<br>  <br>  Cowden disease is a rare genetic syndrome associated with papillomatosis of the lips and oral mucosa, multiple facial trichilemmomas, and acral keratosis. The prevalence rate of breast cancer in women with this disease is 29%. Benign mammary abnormalities (eg, fibroadenomas, fibrocystic lesions, ductal epithelial hyperplasia, nipple malformations) are also more common. Other rare genetic disorders, such as Peutz-Jeghers and Muir-Torre syndromes, are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.|`|Y67BsXXwaa	yes it cant but there is only a real risk if your wear it all the time. i do sometimes when sleeping over at a friends. wearing a bra to bed can damage the soft tissue in your brest. so you mustn't wear one all the time !  =] xx|`|NBmZl0mraa	No, of course not!|`|cYYZw5Mmaa	i heard it yes it does<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.all-natural.com/bras.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.all-natural.com/bras.html</a>|`|LRJmHA7vaa	No it absolutely does not.

How fast you lose depends on the amount you eat. Based on your exercise level and measurements, you need to eat about 2200 calories to stay stable. That means, if you watch your labels and eat about 1700 calories a day, you will lose a healthy amount of weight, 1-3 pounds a week. To lose weight, you should eat about 1400-1700 calories a day. Watch your food labels, and whenever yo feel like you really really have to eat, eat. But otherwise, this should be healthy. If you have more questions, you can contact me
MThzrBiWaa	I have really sensitive eyes, too.  There are many different kinds of contacts that are made out of different materials (not just different period between throwing them away).  If you are able to try a bunch out, you may find a kind that works for you.  It just really depends on your eyes.  Also, the cleaning solution can be irritating as well.  I was given this little thing that you put your contacts in, squirt the solution in, and let it sit overnight.  It's basically peroxide, so it cleans the lenses without leaving anything else on them, as it turns to water overnight.  (This type of solution should obviously never, ever be put into the eyes.)  When using this type, you can just use saline if you need to re-wet the lenses.<br>  <br>  As for me, I gave up on finding a comfortable pair after trying three or four different kinds.  I'll stick with my glasses!|`|z2d5YvOeaa	try some glasses....you can pick out some cool ones too...and no, glasses wont make you look like a dork. =]

Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Bone scan: To help your doctor detect spinal problems such as osteoarthritis, fractures, or infections, you may have a bone scan. You will have a very small amount of radioactive material injected into a blood vessel. That will travel through your blood stream and be absorbed by your bones. More radioactive material will be absorbed by an area where there is abnormal activity—such as an inflammation. A scanner can detect the amount of radiation in all your bones and show the "hot spots" (the areas with more radioactive material) to help your doctor figure out where the problem is.<br>  <br>  <br>  Discogram: This is a procedure that confirms or denies the disc(s) as the source of your pain. You will have a harmless dye injected into one of your discs. If there's a problem with your disc—like it's herniated—the dye will leak out of the disc. The doctor will be able to see that on an x-ray, and that will show him/her that there's something wrong with your disc. <br>  <br>  <br>  Myelogram: To see if you have a spinal canal or spinal cord disorder—perhaps nerve compression causing pain and weakness—you may have a myelogram. In this test, you'll have a special dye injected into the area around your spinal cord and nerves. (Before that happens, the area will be numbed.) Then you'll have an x-ray or a CT scan. The image will provide a detailed anatomic picture of your spine, especially of the bones, that will help your doctor to identify any abnormalities.
fc61a820c63d7c06677681d5406d7929aa	Right now, you need to do EXACTLY what the doctor told you to do.  A fracture near a growth plate can stunt the growth of the bone and for this to heal properly it must stay immobilized.  Don't try and do something he has not cleared you to do.  You may still have pain in the fracture site after you have been cleared to return to play.  This happens a lot.  Rehab ad time takes care of this.  The biggest problem with immobilizing injuries is that the muscles shrink up with disuse.  That is why we do rehab.  Ask for a referral to physical therapy from your doctor.  that will help you strengthen the area  and return to play faster.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	A good orthopaedic surgeon would repair your fractures so that it doesn't affect bone growth.  If you're not confident that he did a good job, ask your mom if she could take you to someone else for a second opinion.  But I'm sure if you were at risk, he would have said something.  He probably mentioned it was near the growth plate just as a matter of fact, not that it was going to pose a problem.|`|pn3xfWEZaa	i broke my whole wrist including my growth plate, and i went to childrens hospital  and got it rebroke when i was 14, i am now 18 and its still doing just fine as if i never broke it. straight as an arrow lol but serious!

The tummy tuck gets rid of extra skin and fat, making the stomach tighter and nicely shaped. In the process of this skin removal, stretch marks below your belly button are usually removed as well. <br>  <br>  Another option is laser surgery. This type of stretch marks surgery is generally only for people whose stretch marks are still colored red or brownish. If your stretch marks have faded to more of a flesh color the laser will not be able to detect them. This surgery is effectively able to remove damaged skin and stimulate collagen growth, but may not always completely eliminate stretch marks. <br>  <br>  Laser surgery can also become incredibly expensive. Each session can cost as much as $1000 or more, and depending on how quickly your skin reacts to the surgery, you may need multiple sessions of laser surgery before your stretch marks fade or go away.  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|wRi75pycaa	There are creams that would help fade them but to completely get rid of them your would have to see a dermatologist and have plastic surgery.|`|CrjozlCjaa	Try Bio Oils.

EeTs9DqUaa	Your blood glucose levels go up and down based on how much and what you eat and when you eat it during the day.  If the big meal was a dinner heavy in protein and good fats to counter balance the carbs you would not have gone as high.  Also what was your reading at 1 and 2 hours after eating both of these meals?  <br>  After that big meal you may have spiked really high and had already rebounded back down to 75.  Any exercise between that meal and the test wolud also lower the number.  <br>  <br>  The issue I worry about is the 136 3 hours after a bowl of cereal.  Cereal is a relatively fast acting carb so by three hours you are definitely coming back down from the spikes peak, so how high were you at one and two hours?  Has your doctor done a OGTT test?   This tests your tolerance to glucose and by reading your question I would strongly recommend you get one done.|`|pRF5LLloaa	cereals are known for having HUGE amounts of sugar added!  Surprisingly, one of the WORST offenders is Corn Flakes!  But one of the best cereals is Cheerios.  Even Honey Nut Cheerios is lower in sugar than most other cereals.<br>  <br>  The SIZE of the meal is only partially important.  It is more WHAT you eat that HOW MUCH.  A large meal of baked fish and steamed vegetables will do a lot less damage than a small bowl of cereal.<br>  <br>  The 134 reading is a LITTLE high.  Given the sugar content of cereals, I'd say you body is working just fine!  You are probably NOT diabetic.

It depends if you did it W/C or W/O Contrast. <br>  Now a MRI is a very different exam it gets very specefic, it is the best for the symptoms you described.

P544Sbmqaa	If you donate actual marrow, it will be done under general anesthesia, or at the very least with an epidural.  You will be sore for up to a couple weeks after, but you arent going to feel them taking the marrow.  <br>  <br>  If you could feel it, its horrible. Bone marrow biopsies are done the same way, just on a far smaller scale, and with local anesthesia only.  There really isnt anything I can compare it to.  Even though the marrow is fluid, its more like a tissue.  When you pull out the marrow, its kind of the equivalent of cutting off a peice of skin.  Its taken from the hip, and during the biopsies I can feel it pulling all the way from the tip of my toe through my leg and up through my hip.  <br>  <br>  However, most donations today are peripheral blood stem cells.  Hemaopoetic stem cells (the type of cell in the marrow that allows the transplant to work) are also found in the circulating blood.  PBSCs are taken using aphersis, which is no big deal.  The worst part there is gaining veinous access with a larger than normal needle.  If you have ever been to the plasma center or done like a double red cell donation, its the same process, except its a different type of cell being collected.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marrow.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.marrow.org</a> is the National Marrow Donors Program for the US and can give you info.  If you are in a different country, search for your country's marrow program or call the US registry for info for your country.  In the UK, its the Anthony Nolan Trust, but I dont have that website offhand.
RgEtKVaKaa	Why aren't you happy?  Happiness is fleeting if you base it on life's situations.  Find true, authentic joy.  You have a purpose greater than your self - find it.

I know I've dealt with depression since the age of 9 and I will be 54 this Aug. Yes there have been times when my life totally sucked and I wanted to kill my self. I made the first attempt when I was 8 years old, so that tells you how bad things can get.  But I also have 3 great daughters whom I wouldn't have if I had killed my self. I wouldn't have met several friends that have brought joy to my life I would have missed seeing my nieces and nephews grow up, I would have missed enjoying watching my girls become women and start their own lives.  I would have missed a thousand other  things that have made my life great and fun.  Yes there are days that I still want to curl up into a ball, but with therapy and medications I can live day to day knowing that there is a lot of joy and happiness if I'm willing to work for it and not give up.  How do you make others happy when you're not happy with whom you are?? You can't but you can make things better for yourself if you're willing to work and to get some help.

And even just going to a couseller. Yor school should provide couselling. But I reccomend seeking help from the doctor and the couseller. Your life is to precious to waste, Being put on this earth is a gift, and your problems today may not seem so bad tomorrow if you chose the right course! Please seek some help, you realise you need it. There is nothing to be ashamed of or worried about, depression is a common thing and it can be helped.

AA10450066	It's just so that the doctor can see more than what an ekg shows. With you having high bp he/she is just probably getting what is called a"baseline" echo so there will be one on record.An echo is more like a picture of the heart so the doctor can see any abnormal results of the different chambers of the heart along with all the arterial and venous vessels that go to and from to the rest of the body.Good luck and don't worry.I'm sure if the doctor thought there was anything wrong he/she would let you know.

Also, cut out entirely soda, concentrated, or super sugery drinks. Drink LOTS of water. I make sure I have a bottle of water with me everywhere I go. Even if you don't want to buy cases of it, what I do is reuse the bottles and just refill them whenever I'm at home. Try having 3 or 4 in the fridge and whenever you have a craving, grab that water and just chug it down. Trust me, it helps!!!

Diet wise I eat three healthy meals a day. For breakfast it's usually oatmeal with fruit. Start eating 1 serving of fruit or vegetables with every meal. I see you don't really have time to cook. So I suggest preparing meals the night before or buying HEALTHY instant meals. Like Fiber One cereal/poptarts, Quaker instant oatmeal, frosted falkes cereal with bannanas or min wheat cereal, etc. Remembre to try to get fruit in with every meal. TRY. If your not a big fruit person prepare it diffrently. For example,I eat golden apples with peanut butter, that's protein, fiber, and numerous vitamins. Theres are also apples with honey, you can mix strawberries with bannannas and fat free/lowfat milk and create a delicious breakfast smoothie.

I prefer what I have here- information that can help to make better choices. I don’t know how much you know, so I’ve listed pretty much everything I have read about weight loss over the years. Sorry it’s so long!<br>   <br>   They say losing weight is 75% diet and 25% exercise. I agree: diet is ESSENTIAL. You can run for an hour a day every day, but if you eat every meal at McDonalds, you will see no progress. <br>   <br>   Diet = what you eat. You are already (and always) “on a diet”<br>     Therefore:<br>   <br>   Don’t think of “going on a diet”. Think of making lifestyle changes, or simply eating healthier. <br>                      Permanent change = permanent results!<br>   <br>   calories = energy. We all need them. Our bodies retaliate when they do not get enough food: our metabolism slows down, we are exhausted, and everything we eat turns to fat.<br>   <br>          You should NEVER feel starved when eating healthier (for the reason listed above). You should listen to your body; this means eating when you are hungry (easy) and stopping when you are full (more difficult, but becomes easier with time).  Slow down when eating, and drink plenty of water. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to know you’ve eaten anything at all. <br>   <br>       Small, incremental changes work best. Slowly replace bad habits with good ones, and you are on your way to permanent weight loss.<br>   <br>   Now, onto the reason for all this: food. I have highlighted the foods that should comprise most of your diet. Notice I said most, not all!<br>   <br>   Your Dietary Friends: (melts away pounds)<br>   <br>   1) FIBER<br>  ? Found in: whole grain bread/rice/pasta, fruits, and vegetables<br>  ? Why: The body cannot digest fiber and it is calorie-free. Plus, it fills up space in your stomach. So, you feel satisfied with less calories. Also, foods that  have a lot of fiber tend to be very low-cal. <br>   2) PROTEIN<br>  ? Found in meat and dairy products<br>  ? Why: Protein is filling! <br>  ? Try to get your protein from lean sources: meat that is not fried, low fat cheese and yogurt, skim milk, tofu, lean beef.<br>   3) WATER<br>  ? We all know that water is good for you. It keeps you hydrated and helps clear your system of toxins. <br>  ? But it also prevents over-eating. Many people mistake hunger signals for thirst. If your stomach isn’t growling but you feel you should eat something, grab a nice tall glass of water first. And drink plenty during meals.<br>   4) FAT<br>  ? Yup. The idea that less fat in your food means less fat on your body just isn’t true. Fats are an essential part of a well-balanced diet. Focus instead on eating the kinds that are good for you (mono- and polyunsaturated fats). Found in fish, nuts (almonds are a particularly good choice), olive oil. The type to avoid (which is usually the type we eat) is below.<br>   <br>   Dietary Enemies: (packs on pounds)<br>   <br>   1) TRANS FAT<br>  ? Found in countless food items; crackers, cookies, donuts, fast food….<br>  ? Disguised as partially hydrogenated oil on food labels. <br>  ? ALWAYS check food labels for trans fat! Labels are allowed to lie- if a serving of a particular food has less than .5 grams, they can say it has none. Its not much, but it can quickly add up. So read the ingredients to be sure.<br>  ? Trans fat is foreign to your body- it doesn’t know how to digest it. It is a relatively new creation. Unlike fiber, however, it has a lot of calories. So, not knowing what to do with it, the body simply stores those calories as (you guessed it) fat.<br>  ? As for saturated fat, it is fine in moderation. (found in animal and dairy products.) But try to cut back as much as possible.<br>  <br>   2) HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP<br>  ? It’s cheaper to manufacture than sugar, which is why it is used in so many foods. <br>  ? True- too much sugar, even natural sugar, is bad for you. But HFCS messes with your body’s signals to your brain that tell it you are full. So you eat more than you normally would. <br>  ? I don’t agree with those new commercials that say it is ok. I have read too much information from more reliable sources that say the exact opposite.<br>  ? Look for it in the ingredients list on labels. It, like trans fat, is everywhere. Soda, cookies…the list goes on and on. Try to avoid it as much as possible. And again, check labels!<br>  ? If it is listed in the first 5 ingredients, consider an alternative (this goes for trans fat too). The higher it is on the ingredient list, the more of it there is in the food.<br>   <br>   Be smart and read food labels!!!!!<br>   <br>  So that’s what to eat, now here’s how:<br>  <br>    These are habits I have picked up over the years that prevent me from gaining weight like crazy. I may gain a few pounds here and there, but my weight stays relatively stable because of these tricks.<br>  <br>   1) Don’t cut your favorite foods completely! You’ll go crazy. Just try and eat healthy foods MOST of the time, and you will be successful. Allow treats every few days (or once a week). Just use portio|`|o0JZnHdXaa	Don't bother joining the gym, walking/running and cycling are all you need to lose weight, plus it's cheaper and you're not tied into one boring place.<br>  <br>  Buy plenty of fresh fruit, and leave it in the kitchen - then whenever you feel like snacking just grab a banana and go. It's also better to have 5 to 6 smaller meals than 3 big ones, to boost your metabolism. <br>  <br>  Remember to eat slower, and chew more - this increases te time for the "full" signals to reach the brain, and thus you are more likely to stop when you feel full, rather than carry on regardless.<br>  <br>  Find some recipes that you can do when you have spare time and then put in the fridge/freezer, so you have a healthy meal when you're in a rush. Things like soup are easy to prepare and are relatively healthy {e.g. Heinz chicken noodle soup has only 121 calories per tin}.<br>  <br>  Finally, keep a log of what you eat and when so you know when the problem times are. Once identified, give yourself a task to do at those times, so you forget about the hunger - which isn't really hunger usually, just your body wanting continuity. <br>  <br>  Oh, and of course, drink water, lots of it. Especially before and after a meal.<br>  <br>  If you want any more advice or such, send me a message!|`|bmoCpcdraa	the best way to shed pounds is to drink no soda ,no diet soda, do not fry any thing .bake fish ,tuna no mayo, bake or boil chicken or turkey, bake enough to last 3 or 4 meals,use extra meat to eat  cold or mix in salad, bake some veggies in same pan to get good flavor,bake extra veggies to re-heat later, make big pot of soup ,with veggies and some chicken and cabbage etc.,make lots of extra so you can re-heat one bowl at a time, drink 6 glasses of water a day ,it is a must,i would carry them small water bottles around with me ,cause you can put the lid on them if they get warm then re-refrigerate ,try not to eat to much bread, try not to eat to late before bed ,eat lots of fruit and veggies, if you have leftovers in frig. you may be  more willing to eat them then a fat snack,get some sliced fat free cheese,you can melt a slice on some veggies to make them taste better, make sure you eat well, it is a healthy choice not a diet,,, hope i helped|`|XYAaRG1Baa	I would take it slow, inch by inch life's a synch, yard by yard, life is hard.<br>  <br>  lol but you definitely have a good 20 mins in your day and if you somehow don't then wake up earlier and go walk or jog, whatever challenges yourself for 20 mins, don't be scared to up the intensity if it is getting easy, and also yea no more sugar, and only drink water. lol good luck, i know it will be really hard, but you said you have will power so good luck!

I hope everything works out fine with the lump, your daughter, and grandchild. =)|`|RgEtKVaKaa	Sometimes.  A needle biopsy would be safe for the baby however, if your daughter is not worried, it will be difficult for you to convince her to get a biopsy.  The biopsy is performed by a surgeon right in his/her office.  Keep in mind that breasts change a lot during pregnancy - especially the later months when they are preparing for lactation.  Lumps that are suspicious feel different from those that are not - an OB/GYN usually has a lot of experience feeling breast lumps.  Good luck.  Enjoy your grandchild.<br>  <br>  The response from Roakieshore is, with all due respect, ridiculous.  As a nurse, I have seen many physicians make many mistakes - some of them have been fatal.  We are responsible for the care we receive.  Marcus Welby never lived.  In a perfect world, we could abdicate to our healthcare provider but for now we must take control.  Doctor does NOT know best.|`|eNhVVmG7aa	Doctors can have an impression as to what a lump is, but it's kind of impossible to be completely sure.  Depending on whether it moves around, is hard or squishy, appears to have a liquid component, etc...  those sort of things all factor into what the doctor thinks.  But generally, the next step would be mammography and then perhaps a biopsy.  <br>  <br>  Your doctor's daughter probably believes this lump is a fibrous cyst, basically a walled-off little sac of fluid.  I've felt quite a few of them myself, and certain women's breasts tend to have these develop over their lives.   <br>  <br>  I know that you are worried sick, and I have to tell you - there is no way to be sure without some further investigation.  Her doc probably doesn't want to mess with mammography at this point if it's not necessary.  And of course, it's generally not the OBGYN who follows up on breast lumps.  A good middle ground might be a simple needle aspiration to see if it is indeed just fluid walled off.  A GP could easily take care of that.<br>  <br>  John Jones, M.D.|`|KK0uuU3Maa	Of course they can tell! If she trusts the Dr. (and to see the same OBGYN more than once, you must) I would take the Drs word for it. If it were serious, everyone would know and it would be a big deal. Two months with a fibroid in her boob isnt going to kill her. Relax.
IMPvzBk1aa	I would remove the makeup, of course, and just apply a cold damp cloth over them.  You can use sterile gauze and sterile saline if you have it, but if not, just the cold will be helpfull.  You may have an infection beginning, so handle the cloth with that in mind.  Also, if you have sterile saline, you can flush your eyes with it.|`|SxaZa13xaa	I have the same thing right now, u have an ingrown eyelash also known as a stye. Put a warm washcloth on your eye a couple times a day. It will loosen the skin. What ever u do don't try and pluck it. Mine was itchy for a while and then it stopes but in a few days it got itchy again and then I could see the ingrown eyelash cuz there was a little Bump Don't touch it a lot and if it sarts to irritate your actual eye or gets inflamed go see a doctor. It sholud goaway on it's own. <br>  <br>  Good luck! And I hoped this helped!

CMjSkDOMaa	You may or may not. It isn't a maturity issue. What is mature is that you are taking steps to try to better yourself. Personally for me, I am terrible at explaining things over the phone, a little better in person, much better if I can sit back and type it. It may be a pressure under time thing, or a self confidence issue. This is true for me because typing something allows me to take the pressure off and take as much time as I need to fully explain something. Perhaps it is simply an issue of being articulate or not. Some people simply are, and some are not. I wish you the best of luck and hope you are able to achieve what you are trying. It certainly isn't an issue of maturity though.|`|AA11404742	Maybe.<br>  <br>  But you'll get better with practice, too.  Think a bit about what you're trying to explain first, and try to get the facts and steps in a logical order.  You could practice by writing down an explanation, for example.  If I told you to explain how to make a ham sandwich, you could probably do that OK, right?  So start with something simple, and work your way up.  Maybe the next step is explaining how to do laundry, or solve an algebra homework problem.  Or pick things that have given you trouble before when you've tried to explain them.  <br>  <br>  The more you practice, the better you'll get.|`|vPAftdO7aa	I don't think it has much to do with maturity. I imagine your mind is still clinging to some basic French form of speaking. Maybe your brain is confused a bit, but I do think you'll get past that. Maybe practice explaining things in your free time to yourself? Use a thesaurus. :)
AA10350894	Sounds like nerve damage to me, but I am no doctor. You should redirect this question to your personal physician.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Only your doctor can advise you on this.|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	I'm no health care professional so don't do as I say until you check with your doctor or nurse practitioner or what have you.  If you can safely, and you think the problem is blood not returning, elevate your feet above your heart ( lay down with feet up).  If you think the problem is blood not getting to the feet and you don't have neuropathy issues try keeping your legs warm or even adding heat (hot water bottle, heating pad, hot bath...). Without a spinal injury I get my feet red itchy & swollen just by getting them wet and cold.  Perspiration or weather can be the source of wet and cold is climate.  Being sure to always have warm dry socks and foot wear helps.  There are medicines for circulation  as well as some natural circulatory stimulants.  Have you told you health care people about this & what did they suggest?|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Hi, try this homemade item<br>  When you don't have time for a separate foot-bath, rub the feet with a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water in equal amounts. Or you can massage 1 to 2 drops of rosemary essential oil diffused in a teaspoonful of vegetable oil into the feet for 5 minutes before you take your bath.<br>  Sorry, that's all I have on this, hope that helps, take care :)
8c97dcbb7a9885fb95ecc7b00dbef5b7aa	I had the same problem.  You have an eye infection.  My doctor prescribed Neosporin Ophthalmic Ointment.  This antibiotic works quickly and the problem soon went away. If you get this medicine, I suggest placing the tube in very warm water before applying.  This will make the ointment more liquid and easier to apply.  If you don't treat it soon, chances are you will infect the other eye and probably pass this infection on to others around you.  Good luck!|`|tUaRawDNaa	Start using warm compresses (hot warm washcloth)  for 15 mins on that eye. The puffiness should decrease within a few days. You could be getting a stye. It may be a little itchy too, so don't itch! Set an appointment with an ophthalmologist just to be safe.|`|tisqCuf6aa	Don't be using home solutions - go see a doctor!|`|vpF6UAvEaa	try using eye droplets and GO SEE YOUR EYE DOCTOR!!!|`|WVVoOU9baa	it may be pink eye, i would try eyedrops then if that doesnt work i would go ot my eye doctor :]|`|MDgVPwU3aa	go and see your eye doctor
1oBilGHuaa	It sounds like you have a level of maturity that the other students lack.<br>  They are not worth getting pissed off at.  Try not to waste you energy thinking about them.  Find other friends that are more mature like yourself.  When you participate in class, let your individuality and maturity show through.  Best Wishes to you.|`|b5JnSBstaa	Wow, hang in there. It sounds like a lot of the kids in your class are demented lunatics that will probably grow up to be serial killers. If they are laughing during that slavery video, then they are seriously mentally disabled.  Just hang in there. School sucks!!!  I'm now 23 years old and all the "popular" people from school are now fatso single parents and look like crap.  Some of the meanest bullies from my class are now super polite people.  Once you get out of highschool you can just live your life and ignore what people say.  Don't do anything nasty to your classmates just ingore them. There are more important things in life than being popular and being well liked. Just be yourself and when you graduate you can say screw all of you and I never have to see you again. LOL!!!  Life does get better and highschool isn't the end of the world.  Just be true to yourself and be a good person, it seems like you're doing good so far. And don't cave to peer pressure, some people are just idiots and will do anything they are told.|`|33d723ba120640009483dbe72ec4526baa	Wow.<br>  I know exactly how you feel.<br>  I go to an alternative school where the people that DO act up have known the teachers for quite some time, so the teachers ALWAYS take their sides, even when they are wrong.<br>  and the whole "IGNORE IT" thing is from people who have never been in your situation and have NO idea what to say.<br>  You have already stepped up and done something about it, which is good.<br>  If they continue to bother you, or your friends just stand up to one of them again, but not with like anger or anything, because thats what they WANT you to do they WANT you to make a scene out of it and get pissed off or sad. Just calmly ask them to stop and tell them to  grow up.|`|E07VAMNMaa	sounds like your in a class full of psychopaths  but alot of teenagers have very little empathy and you are one of the few caring ones.

Well wait a few years or more till they mature enough to understand its not a laughing matter. Or perhaps one of the girls experience the reality of it then they wont think its so funny|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	A lot of kids turn very obnoxious at that age, the kids who aren't very bright have to copy it because they haven't got a chance if they don't follow the trouble makers.  <br>  <br>  Some of them probably laughed at the slavery doc to look cool by making it seem that they didn't care.<br>  <br>  ps it'll probably end in a year or so and you'll wonder if some of the kids are really the same people.|`|zNGWFKXGaa	Sounds like your having quite a bad crowd around you. I guess the best is really to ignore their comments most of the time as long as they are not directed to you. Stick to your true friends and remember that once school ends  you will meet many other people. Be advised that you find unfortunately this kind of people everywhere... school, university, work... and you better start getting used to the idea.... Start some sports in your free time like rock climbing, yoga, martial arts etc.... As weird as it sounds besides keeping you fit these sports give balance in live and help dealing with any kind of issue....

FHQZz8dNaa	Yeah I had similar issues, you are due to get your period soon. Sice you are young, even if you have had your period, it takes a while to have a regular menstral cycle. Clean daily, and see a doctor to recheck.

If you are really concerned about this, tell a trusted adult so that you can consult a doctor about it.  Sounds normal to me, though.<br>  <br>  edit: You can go to your regular doctor.  Even once you start getting regular pelvic exams it is perfectly okay to go to your regular doctor for this sort of thing.

eLlZb0f9aa	Check with your doctor, I know that sometimes when you get a urinary tract infection it just drains you out so you just feel so tired and at times you dont even have symptoms like the burning sensation. Any back pain? If you stay busy the whole day you might just be tired from the busy schedule so give your body a break sleep in on the weekday drink a lot of water.|`|qpkXD4RCaa	Well, theres a few things that could be happening.<br>  <br>  1. Like most people your not sleeping enough and in result your not having very much energy.  If this is the case sleep more.<br>  <br>  2. Your having problem sleeping, either because you have problems sleeping or you have something on your mind.  Either way, talk to a doctor or take some medicine that helps you sleep.<br>  <br>  3. You have an uncomfortable matress or some condition in your house is stopping you from sleeping well.  Fix that problem, sleep upsidedown, get a new mattress, you know what i mean.<br>  <br>  4.  Your doing alot of physically demanding things in the day and your tired and you need to sleep more. (solution in number 1)<br>  <br>  You feel fully rested when you get enough rem sleep.  The recommended amount of rem sleep is 3 hours a day, sadly, on average your body only gets 1 hour of rem sleep for every 3 hours you actually sleep.  You can get more rem sleep by wearing yourself out in the day, or making yourself extremely tired which is the exact opposite of number 4.|`|Z71rcBk5aa	Maybe you're not getting enough sleep. Even though you are going to bed at your "normal time" it still might not be enough. Aim for 6-9 hours a night. This might have to do with the quality of your sleep. You might want to try to avoid distractions. Turn off your computer and cell phone. Also, sleeping in a dark area improves quality of sleep; so close all your curtains, turn your alarm clock away from you, close your bedroom door. Are you feeling tired through out the day? If so, you might possibly have mono..  hope this helps..|`|xtq6LdZTaa	stop being a pussy|`|GcnujfHhaa	maybe you have your sleeping patterns wrong maybe you should sleep in the afternoon. so you can go to sleep at 11 and wake up early.|`|zMj2ikmeaa	Depending on where you live (way up north in colder climes or further south in sunnier climes) it could be winter blahs....or like me, it could be hormones and PMS.<br>  <br>  Last May (2008) I was so exhausted beyond belief for a whole week but I couldn't sleep either. My breasts were so excruciatingly sore so I did an HPT (home pregnancy test) which turned up normal. I went to my doctor for a gblood test that came back negative...got the call days later, just an hour after starting my period.<br>  <br>  The doctor said it could just be my hormones being wild. He said "it's just liek being pregnant." So I asked "You mean I can feel this exhausted to the point I can't function and NOT be pregnant?"<br>  <br>  His answer "Yep."<br>  <br>  So, either it's your hormones (pregnant or not) or you need something like a vitamin supplement like Vitamin B or D.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't clear up in a week or so, I'd consider seeing a doctor for a regular check up.<br>  <br>  Could be serious, could be not.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

f8mLpPXlaa	Walking pneumonia and "standard" pneumonia are the same thing. They call it walking because it's a mild case and doesn't involve enough of the lungs to cause impairment in your daily activities.<br>  And you don't catch a cold or anything else by being in cold weather whether it's rainy and cold or dry and cold. You get viruses from coming in contact with them on doorknobs etc.  Pneumonia can be viral or bacterial or there are other types but basically those are the two. Sometimes when your immune system is weakened when fighting off a cold a bacteria which it could normally deal with gets a chance to develop into bronchitis and then pneumonia. But in general you have to be exposed to the virus or bacteria for it to form pneumonia.<br>  OK.. That said there is a type of pneumonia called hypostatic pneumonia. That's what horses and other large animals get when they can't get up and breath properly. It happens in humans too like a patient who can't do it themselves aren't rolled every few hours they can get it just from the fact that an area of the lungs is not being ventilated properly. You see this often in nursing homes where patients are neglected.|`|WkcPWmR9aa	infectious pneumonia can be acquired if you are in contact with the infected person, it is very contagious because most of its type is cause by virus.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|jQCy5x9Iaa	Hey dear,<br>  there's an article i read and it helped me very much, it was talking about meal plans and how to use the calorie shifting technique to achieve your ideal weight without starving, this web based program it's all about how to get you to lose 9 lbs. every 11 days in a healthy manner.<br>  anyway you can see for yourself here is the link to this article <a href="http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/fat-loss-for-idiots-online-diet-system-secret-tips/" rel="nofollow">http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/...</a> hope it helps|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

In high school I got on birth control and now periods are like clockwork and last between 2-4 days.|`|bunAXlrXaa	nothing's wong with you<br>  everyones' is irregular for the first few months<br>  don't worry, in afew years it will straighten out<br>  if you're worried, you might want to see a doctor<br>  good luck!!|`|ORUAtr0kaa	You just started it, so it's going to be irregular. Try to keep a pad/tampon handy with you at all times, in case you need it.|`|R6CuDunzaa	There is nothing wrong with you :) When I first got my period, I didn't have another one for 6 months! It is always irregular when it first comes. & yes it could take years for it to become normal. If it's really bothering you a lot, you could consider getting on the pill (birth control). Most doctors will prescribe it to younger girls if it's for their period. If you can't get on the pill, don't worry! It will eventually be normal. & even when it does become normal, you could always be irregular a couple of times. There's nothing wrong with you.|`|Zgdxavnmaa	Nothings wrong. Your periods will be irregular like this for a while as you only started it last year and so it hasn't settled down yet. This happens to everyone and nothings wrong.

FtEkredUaa	If your going to have sex don't put the cream on. For example say if you was going to have sex at night .. or you think you might then put the cream on morning - midday or around then to allow the cream to set properly. Don't put it on an hour or so before because it may cause an infection in your vagina. Put the cream on when your meant to, but just be careful so it doesn't go inside.|`|Zgdxavnmaa	Whether you can or not I don't recommend it, cos it won't do you any favours. Your vag will probably hurt more and if the cream gets on your boyfriend it might irritate his skin. This makes it less fun for both of you!|`|PgYWSUeEaa	put the cream on and becareful about sweat or anything else getting in there that could cause infection.|`|fif9ku6Aaa	Doctor should answer this, <br>  and well can you wait?!<br>  <br>  my real question is why did he scratch your vag, dosnt seem fun to me..|`|z7veoTrjaa	I am sorry you are going through this, it must be awful!

xZoTrrsnaa	Nope, it's fine! Don't worry about it!I won't scold you. If you feel you are going to pass out, have an apple or orange or even a few grapes! Fruit is the best for that because it has natural sugar in it to energize the body. Choose a nice sweet fruit if you feel faint.|`|A5XuZ3pIaa	OMG!!!!! you PROBABLY just gained 20 f***in'  Lbs!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Jk.... your okay.....relax.......i have tried not to eat at all before too, well I ended up eating a fruit saled.....the FIRST time.......try again tomorrow... don't do this longer then a month of not eating though.......|`|EeGlkABPaa	an apples okay but if this happens again you could try eatign only half an apple first and then if you still need to eat the rest of the apple.|`|W6wamWLLaa	you know the answwer!|`|483Kjwy0aa	Not eating is not good for your body. An apple provides like no calories and is not enough to eat in a day. Your body needs a certain amount of calories daily just to do everyday bodily functioning, not including any movement you might do (walking, talking, moving your arms/legs). Talk to your doctor about this, you might benefit from psychological help. I would not recommend to continue to eat like this; you will get very sick.|`|QMcuXXrlaa	An apple has less than 100 calories. People generally need about 2000 or so a day. Yes, I'm giving you crap about not eating- honey, your anorexic. I have the same problem. You can contact me if you want help, honestly, I understand how you feel. But if you don't take action now, you're going to die. Anorexics are in denial that they have an eating disorder, and you do to. When I say you can die, I mean it. People think it doesn't apply to them, but it does. Don't worry, contact me if you need anything|`|kaErLoARaa	You must have a very small appetite! Maybe because you might have a very hectic life or worried about something in particular? <br>  I sense you are very young too.

By eating very little if nothing at all you are slowing your metabolism down so drastically that in fact you will gain weight because your body will store every last calorie possible (read: fat).  Simply eating low calorie foods about 6 times a day from morning to bedtime will be enough to jack up your metabolism to the point that your body will burn massive calories just from sitting on your soon to be skinny ***!

I hope you stop this attention seeking before it has serious consequences for your health.|`|5qXyuvsAaa	One of the best things to eat is a cube of cheese<br>  <br>  Apples are very sugary but the cheese can last longer|`|cae6c8e25d6a61178ea135a0b7c41725aa	it's ok. I'm sure that the apple was ok. even if you eat something sweet you'll still loose weight. and be careful, you can really pass out. it happened to my friend. don't forget to exercise, it will make loosing weight faster. and also you might want to drink grean tea or take gingsheng extract or some caffein to prevent fainting and to give you more energy. you can do it instead of an apple. it will help.|`|Y3ghamr7aa	OK I'm going to yell at you anyways! <br>  No an apple was not a lot of food! It was not enough food!<br>  If you don't eat it will really screw you up! you could be looking at death here or other serious health risks<br>  and it won't make you look more attractive if that's what you want!<br>  <br>  You'll regret doing this when you get older<br>  I know you won't believe me now, but I was the same way, and I really regret ever doing that! it screwed up the best years of my life<br>  I was so alone and lost so many friends, I got no respect.

You're about that age. You should use a good cleansing soap and try to get a soap that makes your skin kind of dry. If it gets too bad then you should go to a doctor.

bmoCpcdraa	the best way to shed pounds is to drink no soda ,no diet soda, do not fry any thing .bake fish ,tuna no mayo, bake or boil chicken or turkey, bake enough to last 3 or 4 meals,use extra meat to eat  cold or mix in salad, bake some veggies in same pan to get good flavor,bake extra veggies to re-heat later, make big pot of soup ,with veggies and some chicken and cabbage etc.,make lots of extra so you can re-heat one bowl at a time, drink 6 glasses of water a day ,it is a must,i would carry them small water bottles around with me ,cause you can put the lid on them if they get warm then re-refrigerate ,try not to eat to much bread, try not to eat to late before bed ,eat lots of fruit and veggies, if you have leftovers in frig. you may be  more willing to eat them then a fat snack,get some sliced fat free cheese,you can melt a slice on some veggies to make them taste better, make sure you eat well, it is a healthy choice not a diet,,, hope i helped|`|FxAD44Moaa	easy, sheesh!     no more processed food!<br>  <br>  that, sorry to say, includes dairy!<br>  <br>  <br>  just fresh fruits and veggies for you!<br>  <br>  :D

AA12353364	Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary disease . The  disease involves that the body manufactures  misshaped red blood cells . The misshaped cells can form clots cutting off circulation to parts of the body including the heart. The victim must undergo frequent blood transfusions . The disease affects east african and central african  people of color and people of middle eastern origin such as arabs and ashkenazi israeli people . The disease is not infectuous it is only inherited similar to hemophelia , and cystic fibrosis . The ironic thing about sickle cell anemia is that people with this disease have a type of immunity to malaria and yellow fever .
h0ypk4Dtaa	The good news first, the body has a remarkable ability to heal, and by stopping cigarette smoking you have already enabled it to begin to heal. There is a lot of ambiguity as to how well the lung will heal after ceasing cigarette smoking, but you have two things going for you.<br>  1) The cumulative damage will stop now.<br>  2) You are young enough that the body's immune system will be able to make dramatic improvements.<br>  The bad news is that a lot of damage has already been done. Tar and other impurities have been deposited into the lung and will either cause scar tissue to develop or be lucky enough to have macrophages devour it. Vascular damage and tissue damage has already occurred, and your chances of developing lung cancer or other fibrotic lung disease have increased significantly.<br>  Stay off the cigarettes, as difficult as that is, it is well worth it for you. Keep working out and eating healthfully.
Bp2a8w8Taa	Every person's body is different. The most common period of time is anywhere from 3-30 days, depending on your metabolism and the amount of marijuana that you’ve smoked, but it's usually 10 days or less. Hope I helped you out man.|`|TFdoHYP4aa	Forever.<br>  <br>  It's illegal.
XawzWyyIaa	If the appointment is just for the x-rays, they probably won't come off that same day. It takes a while to take them off. But at least you have that to look forward to, having braces is really worth it when they come off and you have straight teeth. You could always call your dentist office and ask specifically what the appt is for, and when you go for your x-rays ask her when they can come off. You might want to make another appointment to get your teeth whitened if you want, sometimes you can have discoloration where the braces were attached, although some people don't have this happen.|`|1S0zHM8Kaa	If your orthodontist is getting the xrays done in your next appointment, then it is highly likely you will not get them off by then.  For just about everyone I know (including myself) the projected date for getting braces off has been pushed back.  In most cases, it was pushed back by a month or so.  So unfortunately my guess is that you will have to wait, but then again I can't see how straight your teeth are.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

To answer your question, you cannot get pregnant if he touches your clitoris, He can give you and STD . He is making contact with what is referred to as mucous membranes, the skin around your inner labia. Remember you get pregnant he'll walk away and then you're stuck with raising his bastard child for the next 18 years while he goes off to find another  clitoris to rub his penis on. Just think about if he "Accidentally" slides his penis into you.
adda9d42cc1b667af7107c9fe6361417aa	I do not know what it could be, but from my experience with skin fungus, it can last a day or months depending on how you treat it. If you go about your day without doing anything, it can last forever and have some consequences like burning, itching, and maybe eventually skin peeling.<br>  <br>  Try to keep your back dry for the next few days, and wash it regularly. Fungus likes warm, moist areas. <br>  <br>  When I had my foot fungus (athletes foot), I assumed it would go away on its own. After a month, the itchynes and burning was unbearable. My skin, in the moistest of places, like between the toes, started to break apart and peel. Which, of course, helped to create more moisture. So finally I gave in and bought Tinactin and it vanished within a couple days. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could try spraying some of that on your back. It's not expensive and it doesn't hurt to try.

2OO9U8o9aa	I can't spell either but I use the spell check function !!  Anyway the easiest thing to do that will make you last longer and the orgasm much better is edging .

The scaring this can be a side effect of surgery , what kind of "disfigurement " are we talking about ?

However the disfigurment may be just cause . You will want to retain a lawyer and contact a second doctor , for a second opinion ..<br>  NO2 is not used for major surgeries unless you get a spinal block and then it is usually accompanied with a hypnotic med  such as Versed not NO2 .

9YkkQbbPaa	Colors don't mean anything, it's just the dye the chemist decided to put in the pill. The colors might have meant something a long time ago, but today they really don't mean anything. You can get some really bomb red pills, and then some that are completely bunk. It all depends on the batch and the chemist.<br>  <br>  Stamps don't mean anything either. They're more branding, which means pills of a certain color and stamp could be good for a few weeks, but then copycats start making inferior pills with the same color and press.<br>  <br>  Just stay current on what pills are good and what pills aren't. Check pillreports.com every couple of days. And get a test kit. That's the most important thing. You never know what's actually in the pills unless you test them yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy rolling.
f8mLpPXlaa	it's called cough syncope. I do that frequently. I get a cough that won't let up and I can't stop but I know if I go on I'll pass out. I pass out because I'm on blood pressure medicine too.<br>  It happens because you trap blood in your head and don't let it get out.As soon as you take a breath everything goes back to normal except you see stars and I end up on the floor. That's why you see some people turn blue when they're coughing because the venous blood can't get out and it builds up pressure in your brain.|`|itAhPNcqaa	when you cough your heart is beating fast<br>  and i would guess that your heart beat is effecting your blood pressure thats why you feel dizzy|`|rec1SNQgaa	the blood pressure in your head rises and presses on your eyes causing you to see "stars"
HvyE4qpYaa	The healthiest way to eat tuna is by itself, without adding anything. LOL.... I doubt that's the answer you're looking for. <br>  <br>  My favorite way to prepare tuna is like this:  Add half an avocado per every 6 oz can... and add salsa.  Avocado has a lot of super healthy fats... fat that you need.  If you want, add less avocado.  Then I pour about 2-3 tbsps of salsa (homemade, storebought, doesn't matter)  <br>  <br>  It's super healthy. and it's very filling.  What I've also done lately is added Fat Free mozarella cheese... really makes it good.  You eat it with crackers, whole wheat bread or by itself if you're on the low carb kick.  Good luck! And Enjoy|`|BhFeii5Xaa	No way tuna is healthy in the first place. Pregnant women are warned not to eat much of it because of the mercury in it.

CdgF3NjFaa	MRI uses magnets and radiofrequency. For that matter it is claimed to be not dangerous. Unlike x-rays which can break the DNA, radiofrequency has very little energy to cause damage to DNA.<br>  <br>  The answer is no, you will not get cancer because of MRI|`|e2LX3c4Laa	Honest answer is that no one really knows for sure.  MRI does not use radiation like x-rays so it is safer to have done more often.  And from the research that has been done, MRI does not cause cancer.  However, MRI is a relatively new procedure.  We have only been doing them since the 80's.  So no one can tell you with 100% certainty that MRI does not have any bad side effects.

Getting all that out to someone who will listen can help. <br>  <br>  All you can do is pick yourself up and move on. You will never forget what has happened to you, it's foolish to try. But learn from it. If you just stay there and sulk about what has happened and how you feel from it, you will go nowhere but into more misery. <br>  <br>  I have depression, but I just put it aside and try my best to not let it interfere w/ my regular life.

AA11020187	About 1/3 of all lung cancers are diagnosed from 65-74 years of age. By the time a tumor is lage enough to be detected it has probably been there a couple of years.|`|JwzX38R5aa	Cancer is not based on age.  My father died at 58 from lung cancer; his sister was much older than that when she died of lung cancer 5 years before.|`|WPzaF2osaa	According to information from the American Cancer Society, the probabilities of developing lung cancer among males are as follows: from birth to 39 years, 0.04%; 40-59 years, 1.24%; 60-79 years, 6.29%; and from birth to death, 8.09%. Among females, the probabilities are as follows: from birth to 39 years, 0.03%; 40-59 years, 0.92%; 60-79 years, 4.04%; and birth to death, 5.78%. As with other histopathological cases of lung cancer, most cases of small cell lung cancer occur in individuals aged 35-75 years; incidence peaks in persons aged 55-65 years.
RgwJ1PNnaa	When I went for my first visit they gave me some trial lenses and asked me to come back a week later, then they gave me a proper supply after they were happy they were right for me. If you want them tomorrow you could ask if they have some you could take on trial.|`|LGidAYDwaa	They will likely have to order your contact lenses, so you may not get them tomorrow. (Of course, some places have a boat load of different prescriptions on hand, so it's possible, but not very likely, that you could get them tomorrow.)  When the contacts come in, then you go back to the eye doctor and that is when they show you how to take care of them and how to put them in/take them out. The only time you put in contacts is when they give you your very own contacts to keep.

najva92baa	I did exactly the same thing on monday....after gym i went to the school nurse and she said that they didn't look too bad but strapped them up for me. I had to take the bandages off the next day (tuesday) and they were bright purple, and really bruised... I didn't know if i should put some more bandages on...so we phoned up my mum's friend who's a nurse and said that it was probrably best to not have a bandage on as it would get me used to using my fingers and getting them back to normal. I also had ice on my fingers but it actually made it worse! So you may want to stop using that...Ohh yeahh and by the way my fingers do feel better today - without the bandages on so you may want to take them off..? If it gets worse though you should really go to the doctors :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|fc61a820c63d7c06677681d5406d7929aa	yes take an advil.  Keep the ice on it.  Quit typing on the computer.  If it is not better ina day or 2 go get an x ray.|`|sH4xX25xaa	u jammed ur finger. it will go away ice !|`|VsMtCrk7aa	Yes, taking Advil or Aleve, according to directions on the packaging, will relieve inflammation. Also apply ice pack 20 minutes at a time every hour. If not better in 3 days make doctor appointment to rule out broken bone.|`|9hpuBMuIaa	Since the nurse did not xray it, she couldn't know if it is broken or not. If it is just sprained, it will get better with ice and pain medication. Don't keep the ice on it all the time though.  Put in on for 20 minutes, off for 20 minutes. If it starts swelling, changing colors or hurts so bad it drives you nuts, then try to get your Mom to take you to a doctor.  It could be you jammed the finger too.  That should really be checked out too.  If you finger is wrapped in an Ace bandage(the tan colored wrap) then make sure it is not wrapped too tight. That isn't good for it as it will cut off circulation. Have it snug, but not tight.

rz6ePHPXaa	I am in the same situation. The surgery will be pretty painful for the first few days. They should give you some great pain killers though. You will probably be put in a tightly wrapped soft cast and your bandages will be changed in the first few days. You should start rehabilitation in about 2 weeks and total recovery should be no more than 10 to 12 weeks. If you have any more questions just ask me...Good Luck.

UlNU2Iydaa	If you try it alone, I don't think you will last. The withdrawals for cocaine are intense, and you will need strong, determined support to break the addiction.<br>  <br>  Some of the symptoms are: <br>  agitation <br>  depression <br>  intense craving for the drug <br>  extreme fatigue <br>  anxiety <br>  angry outbursts <br>  lack of motivation <br>  nausea/vomiting <br>  shaking <br>  irritability <br>  muscle pain <br>  disturbed sleep <br>  <br>  Your chances of success at home would be tough. You are going to want to get some cocaine no matter what the cost, and you are going to be suffering pain. Your emotions are going to drop much lower than normal levels, and you are going to need time, patience, and 4-5 friends that can watch you for 24 hours a day. You would need to remove all sharp objects or usable weapons from the house, and come up with plans for how to react to your symptoms. It can be done, but it will be a strain on your friends, will take extensive planning, and you will not have a single person that is actually trained to help you present.<br>  <br>  Remember you are going to basically lose your mind for a while in order to gain freedom, so it would be protective to your friends as well as yourself to let professionals help you. I would suggest going to a rehab center with the resources and staff you will need to get the highest chances for success.<br>  <br>  You should be proud of your courage to take the first steps towards breaking your addiction. I wish you the best.|`|TRrTunqvaa	go to rehab. have you seen how nice they are!?|`|6e0PG4YWaa	I wouldn't suggest that you try to detox yourself at home, especially from crack.  As the others mentioned, the withdrawals symptoms that you are going to experience are intense, and it would be very difficult even near impossible for you to do it on your own.<br>  <br>  You should get professional help, they know how to handle the withdrawals symptoms, and will be able to get you on the road to recovery a lot sooner than you would be able to alone.  <br>  <br>  There are many facilities to choose from, so you need to make sure that you choose the best one for you.  If you take a look at this site, <a href="http://www.recoveryconnection.org/drug-abuse-treatment-center.php?utm_source=ans&utm_medium=pv&utm_campaign=rcx," rel="nofollow">http://www.recoveryconnection.org/drug-a...</a> on there you will find information about drug addiction treatment programs, and about the road to recovery.

UgZq1pXjaa	For the bed wetting, I don't know how you feel about diapers but I have a 4 yr old that will be 5 later this year that wets the bed almost nightly and I put him in diapers and I'm keeping him in them until he stops.  I also was a bed wetter and my parents always had me in diapers until I stopped which is why I went the same path as my parents did me and use diapers.  Since I have been there I can truly say its much better waking in a wet diaper than wet bedding and wet pajamas.  I think the self esteem is lower waking up in wet nasty bedding.  I don't know much about the sleep walking as I do the bed wetting, the diapers have worked out great...lol...but just to throw this out there, can you not put a lock on the outside of the door so she cannot get out and walk around the house?  Or maybe a safety chain on the door so it will open a little bit and you would hear the door opening.  I don't know if your supposed to confine a sleep walker in their room.  I would definitely add another lock on your doors going to the outside that is higher so she cannot reach them.  I would be interested to know how you solve this one.  I have not known anyone to sleep walk and how you handle it.  Good luck!!|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	Hi, my eldest daughter was really bad, she would wet the bed, and wander around the house.

Ask them what you should do for her, and if her health is right, its common for wetting the bed but around 5 was she ever potty trained? if not the not then of course its normal. But if she was just take her to the doctor as a precaution.

Never touch your face unless you are washing it or applying an acne treatment cream. Also, certain types of make up will make you break out even more as they tend to clog your pores up and make your face even oilier.<br>  <br>  I had the same problem when I was your age. I asked my dermatologist why my acne just wouldn't go away after all the different washes, toners, and creams I used. He said it was because my acne was an internal problem as well as an external problem so I needed to take medication for it......You should talk to your doctor for more information or your dermatologist if you have one.|`|rkDt5iloaa	ok it is important to keep ur face clean but also spots can occur when u have a bad diet eating a lot of junk food. Also hairstyles that leave the hair on the face is bad i dunno the science behind it but its true|`|ux4rkJKdaa	The same is with me...For me, it is stress. I am stressed alot thus have alot of acne. Two other possible choices. First, if you put your hands on your face alot, I've learned that causes alot of acne. The second is hormones...Your hormones could be rushing, as in sexual hormones, and you need to...umm..."relieve" them.
Xp5lgKWOaa	The best way to tone your body is to lose body fat. To lose body fat you need to eat right, do cardio on a regular basis, and lift weights. <br>  <br>  Eating right. <br>  Start out by eating 5 to 6 small meals each day. This is a quick way to speed up your metabolism. You need to speed up your metabolism and let your body know that you do not need to store calories. This is why people that often skip breakfast don't lose weight! Imagine the days when we used to hunt for our food. We would go days without eating. Our bodies are designed to store energy (as body fat) for these periods of time. This is part of survival. When you eat several small meals a day you are telling your body that you do not need to store anything because the food will keep coming. Do not skip meals! Skipping meals will tell your body that it needs to hang on to your fat because you're not eating. Eat lean meats only. Top Sirloin, Fish, chicken and turkey are all great sources of low fat meat. Eat plenty of vegetables. but stay away from corn, carrots and peas. These are high in sugar. Do not eat breads, rice, sugar, or potatoes. It may take a few days to get use to, but when you get into a routine you won't crave these things anymore and they will become easy to avoid. <br>  <br>  Cardio. <br>  Cardiovascular exercises include running, biking, swiming, hiking, walking, dancing, and more. Do cardio often and keep your heart rate up. If you live in a two story house, you can use your stairs as an exercise routine. Start out by walking up and down the stairs and count that as 1 repetition and do as many repetitions as confortable. <br>    <br>  Lift Weights. <br>  Putting on muscle increases your metabolism. If fact it can be more effective than just cardio for burning fat. If you are trying to put on muscle you need to be sure that you're getting enough protein in your diet to build your muscles.|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Work out with weights|`|TKO5mOGUaa	Dance, dancing works lots of muscles and keeps my body toned. I do it in my spare time, here and there.
pRF5LLloaa	BOTH of these disease REQUIRE blood tests from a doctor for proper diagnosis.  NEITHER diabetes nor  anemia can be diagnosed from symptoms alone. But one VERY strong common "common cause" is childbirth!<br>  <br>  One of the major symptoms of BOTH diabetes and anemia is extreme tiredness -- which is ALSO a symptom of just having had a baby!<br>  <br>  BOTH blood tests are very simple.  Depending on the awareness your doctor, you may have had Gestational Diabetes, which will "hang on" for a few months after giving birth.  The good new is that it will usually go away as you return to your pre-birth weight.<br>  <br>  And depending on how difficult the birth was, you may be anemic due to loss of blood.  It takes 2-3 weeks to replace lost blood. In the mean time -- you might be anemic. Again, the good news is that this situation will rectify itself as you body replenishes.<br>  <br>  The doctor can make several recommendations to help ease your problems while you heal after childbirth.  Discuss these concerns at your next visit to your doctor.|`|LNnP3oAgaa	Your GP can give you a blood test for both.|`|ZcfZx60aaa	The only way to know for sure is to have your blood checked for both and get a urine sample.<br>  <br>  If you are anemic due to low iron levels you will be extremely tired, pale, might have shortness of breath, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, dizziness<br>  <br>  Diabetic: Generally you'll drink alot, pee a lot and be really hungry. If it's type I, you might have fruity smelling breath. You will generally feel unwell, weak, and shaky.<br>  <br>  You just had a baby, so a lot of these symptoms could be from all the stress your body is under.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|BhFeii5Xaa	check with your doctor for this problem you are having.<br>  <br>  However since you just had the baby it is very unlikely you are diabetic.

VSxZlktcaa	The severity of PMS differs from woman to woman, so yeah, that could be normal for you, as complicated and annoying as it can be.

XwVDlhsSaa	To prevent the risk of spreading infection to other people it is best to clean when possible. However, given that a desk is not an ideal environment for most bacteria that could cause a cold, they will die on their own sooner or later, either from air exposure, temperature or lack of nutrients.

GBG2hbQ4aa	In some ways, it is harder to be a kid these days.  There are far too many things to distract you, most of which are sedentary.  While the challenges are different, many of the skills a kid needs to learn are the same....to prioritize what has to be done, to apply himself/herself to the necessary tasks, to take care of  personal needs (food, baths, grooming, exercise), to become independent, and especially...to be accountable for your choices as you learn and grow.<br>  <br>  Computers and video games are amazing, but they can take up far too much time.  They also contribute to a too sedentary lifestyle, as well as can cause glitches in the brain (many games have warnings in fine print that the game can cause or contribute to seizures).<br>  <br>  I would certainly limit his time with his xbox.  Actually, I would put it off limits until he gets his grades back up.  I always held my children accountable for time management.  They knew what they needed to do in terms of homework and chores.  As long as they kept up their responsibilities, their time was their own to manage.  If they did not keep up with these things, then I would step in and structure their time.  They didn't like it when I did that, so they made sure they stayed on top of chores and schoolwork.  Course, talk is cheap.  A parent has to enforce any consequences in order for the child to actually respect the rules that are established.<br>  <br>  Most kids are going to prefer xbox, skateboarding, basketball....or whatever ...to doing school assignments.  It is the parents' role to teach the child to manage his time and to establish priorities.  Otherwise the child will grow into an ineffectual adult, unable to manage his own life.|`|lFgM4aFraa	I would say make him get all his homework done first, and tell him that once he is finished with it, he can be free to play the xbox as long as he wants, or do something else thats fun for the rest of the day.

EQAwlKZ5aa	1000-1500 is too little!  (a diet that consists of 1000 cals only  is considered a starvation diet, which will cause your muscles to waste away, and your body will hold on to fat) You should eat 2500 to maintain your weight. Given the fact that you are very active you need all the energy you can get. Remember, you are 16 so you are still growing up. Your brain won't actually stop developing until you are in your twenties! So you shouldn't lower your caloric intake, 2500 sounds good. I think you might even need to increase it a little bit since you are a runner, but if you feel more comfortable with 2500 calories then go for it. Just have plenty of proteins and complex carbohydrates to maximize your energy levels and feed your muscles.Stay hydrated!<br>  I hope this helped!|`|thXFB45Waa	1000- 2000 <br>  If you think you have a fast metabolism 2000.|`|KWSzx2ZLaa	yeah thats sounds good... maybe more...

AA11926520	Based off of your reported symptoms it sounds like it. Usually cold and exercise induced asthma is due to hyperactive airways. I suggest you set up an appointment with you primary care doctor for an examination. He may decided to treat you out of his clinic based on his clinical suspicion or may send you for referral to a pulmonologist (lung doctor) if he believes that a Lung Function test is in order. More than likely your primary care doctor will treat you with an inhaler and it will reduce your symptoms. Go schedule an appointment tomorrow. Don't worry, your condition is common and shared by many. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  ---edit---<br>  <br>  Ms Lamb may not "believe" in it, but it does exist.

Yes, I will tell you that water will keep you feeling full. A diet of ample amounts of protein will keep you feeling fuller longer at meal time. That's way too many snack foods for anyone, caloric wise. Eat more fresh fruit & drink a glass of water with it. It'll give you a feeling of fullness.|`|qeR967J7aa	Warm liquids, like soup with alot of low cal veggies.  Also go for high fiber.  Moderate exercise will decrease your appetite.  Like walking.

Or ask them general questions about themselves, its worth a try<br>  Hope i helped,<br>  Mikey|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	sounds like anxiety there.

muHctmaGaa	Pros: decreases your risk of uterine and endometrial cancers, regulates your cycle, manages many PMS symptoms, increases your breast size<br>  <br>  Cons: may cause PMS symptoms you didn't have (like moodiness, water retention, tenderness, loss of sex drive, etc.), can aggravate preexisting health problems, and doesn't protect against STDs which still makes condoms necessary<br>  <br>  You really have to try different formulas to find the one right for you.|`|VUEvviKzaa	i never really had a problem with them except i didn't always remember to take them so i had to set an alarm on my phone to remind me. The birth control never destroyed my sex drive it actually made it more active.|`|5TAQgcrpaa	Im 16 and i went on it when i was 15<br>  i take lessina the 28 pack<br>  and the first like month - 3 months you might be pmsing like crazy<br>  it didnt really change anything for me cos when i went on it my period was terrible it ranged from 8-14 dayss with horrible pains EVERYWHERE to the point where i couldnt stand up<br>  <br>  now its 7-8 days and i only get those pains for the 1st 2 days...<br>  idontknow honestly you should talk to yer doctor about it but its not a life changing thing really lol<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT : it did NOT kill my sex drive I still have a pretty great sex life.|`|qVgr5OBeaa	Birth control pills have made my periods SO much better! I went from very heavy 7 day periods and cramps that were so intense I literally would pass out if I was standing up, to much lighter periods that last only about 4 or 5 days with cramps that aren't bad at all. The worst day for cramps are the first day of my period and if i pop a couple of<br>   ibproufen the pain is completely gone. the rest of the days i have no cramps at all.<br>  <br>  I take ortho tri cyclen lo.|`|N1ay8hzFaa	I personally would not ever take birth control pills again. They completely destroyed my sex drive. It's been a year since I stopped taking them, and my sex drive still is not 100% back. But I know plenty of women who did not experience that side effect. Everyone is different.|`|MQaIP3Fzaa	well every birth control has its pros and cons. every one is different so the one that might work best for me will work differently for someone else. i suggest talking to a doctor to see which ones are your best options. especially if you only want to take it to ease cramps and have your periods be regular. which i understand, it'll be so much less of a hassle if you know when the period will be there so you can be ready for school.<br>  i wouldn't recommend stopping you period altogether just yet since you are so young, but you can start with one that will give you a specific date to be ready for. <br>  <br>  the patch<br>  pros: you wear it 3 weeks then take it off for a week to have your period. low dosage of hormones so you wont have to deal with excess body gain or anything extreme. <br>  <br>  cons: the patches leave gunk around the square much like if you have a sticker on your body that you can't take off. you have to worry about hiding it so people don't see it. there are a few good places to put it IE:shoulder blade, lower tummy, etc, i'm just saying you do have to be aware of these areas.<br>  <br>  the ring <br>  pros: you wear one ring for three weeks then take it out for a week to have your period then exchange it for a new ring. also low hormones.<br>  <br>  cons: if u were sexually active this would get in the way because although u can take it out for intercourse, if you leave it out for longer than 3 hours its inefective for (i think) either a couple days or a week. if you don't have it in the right area u can feel it. much like if you don't put in your tampon in all the way.<br>  <br>  the shot (this is the one i am on and btw i have been on all of these birth control methods)<br>  pros:you get a shot every 3 months and at first you spot for a little but after a bit you stop your period altogether. <br>  <br>  cons:weight gain, mood swings, high hormones (hence the mood swings) though in some people these hormones can effect them highly or very little.<br>  <br>  now here come the ones i have not been on but still know some things about.<br>  <br>  the pill<br>  pros:low hormones, you do have days where you have your period.<br>  cons:you have to remember to take it everyday.<br>  <br>  really, just schedule an appointment with your doctor or planned parenthood and they can give you more info and more details and find you the one that will work best for you.<br>  have you talked to your mom? i'm sure she'd be happy to help as long as you state very clearly and respectfully that it's not to have sex, just to control your period.<br>  good luck!|`|aGYsSPGoaa	pros: as soon as you are on it for three weeks no contriception<br>  <br>  cons: you can get moody, may cause breast cancer, having to remember taking it<br>  <br>  im 17 and i dont take it because i forget and i get really sad it messes up my hormones maybe talk to your doctor to make sure u get the right one
XwKKC891aa	The best thing I have used next to shaving cream is actually hair conditioner, it conditions your legs as you shave  the absolute best conditioner is the kind you get in the box after coloring your hair; I have heard that the Victoria's secret models use it on their legs.|`|8852ec0792479770e4973eab50a1fbfdaa	i started shaving my legs when i was 10 just about your age, shaving is something that you do not necessarily need to do every day. it does feel good on your legs but there are special shaving creams you can use. one of my first razors was intuition, it has a built in soap bar with the razor so you only need water to shave your legs.|`|Rrn6xRCjaa	i think i started shaving my legs when i was 12. sometimes when i don't have any shaving cream, i use conditioner. that makes my legs soo smooth. i've also used body wash and that also works really well. when you shave just take your time so you wont cut yourself. and also, when you go over your knees, keep your leg straight.. its harder to cut yourself like that.|`|AyStEeCfaa	OH MY GOD you are 11 and shaving? I have an 11 year old who is far from thinking about shaving well any way, once you start shaving hair comes back faster and faster but be careful, you dont want to use too much harsh things on your skin and permantlly scar your self|`|oWDLNOnCaa	well i was 11 also when i first stare shaving...with out shaving cream i use soap..or once in a while i use lotion.. i found out to help stop from missing shave really slow and go ova the same spot a few times|`|CdZK7XjOaa	You can use soap most likely it will work. I was 12 when i started shaving.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	I don't even shave mine - BUT don't worry. I hardly even have any hair at all. It's all really light and it's not noticable. Nair does sound pretty harmful. I wouldn't use it either. I think I am going to start shaving soon though. I'm going on vacation soon and I just think it's time I start. Haha.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	(Miku speaking!)<br>  I started shaving around 9.<br>  but that's only because I found a spare razor in the bathroom and got reallyyy bored.<br>  <br>  I usually shave in the shower though, but I take like...mad-hot showers. xD|`|KfBk9UMraa	I started when I was 12. I have used nair, but don't like the burning sensation. <br>  I shave about once a week, but because I am a cheerleader I shave before a game, usually. <br>  I have a venus, I think its called. Anyway, it has built in shaving gels and it works great. If I don't have my venus and just the throw-out ones then I shave without anything. Just use lotion afterward to soften your legs. If its too hard to shave in the shower then you could shave over the sink. (its easier sometimes)|`|VUEvviKzaa	i don't think you should of started shaving already. i was 12 when i started and i hate myself now that i did that early because its a pain to shave. but i usually use shampoo or conditioner instead of shaving creme.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	Near is horrible and it burns the skin<br>  is better to shave with Palmer's Cocoa Butter<br>  it will leave your legs real smooth and is not messy|`|YrqMrVfOaa	u can use a little soap to shave as well as it reduces friction... while you are showering, put some soap on ur legs and shave them.|`|DTiphZNKaa	I started when i was eleven aswell and its soo annoying, My theory if your not wearing anything showing your legs why bother, haha it might be gross but i only shave on weekends when i see my boyfriend.<br>  Shaving without shaving cream u can try soap or just hand lotion, u might have razor burn but it works handy when you cant get in the shower or just missed a small spot. I agree nair isnt that great of stuff|`|eINo6GPoaa	I started last year or the year b4 I think... I was 10 or 11. I am 12 now. I will be 13 in June so that kinda gives u an idea. I use a bar of soap because I don't have shaving cream either. the bar of soap usually helps. If not don't worry just shave every other day if you can :)|`|1aJjFrUCaa	if you dont have shaving cream. just use a bar of soap, or use shampoo if you dont have anything....<br>  i was 13 when i started shaving my legs.|`|5TAQgcrpaa	i was like 9 or 1O lol<br>  <br>  and nair is scaryy lol i do not want to mess with that.<br>  but dont EVERRR dry shave your legs will literally BURN for the next 2 days<br>  <br>  just use soap or anything even lotion lmao|`|T20lVPDkaa	never shave without anything. i started shaving when i was about 12.<br>  you dont have to shave EVERY day too.|`|UaOB9edEaa	13.  You should try rain shower bodywash/shaving gel, it works better than shaving cream.|`|aGYsSPGoaa	i started at 10<br>  i use soap so i can see my hair when i shave<br>  nair can be harmful it has chemicals and can burn your skin|`|0dSZ4yOTaa	i was about 11 or 12?

62f0f93f9e81c6452c048e86e6fb495baa	As for exactly what's wrong I'm not sure but here think about this ...  We all struggle in this life with things, you never know what's going to eat at you from time to time your hair don't look right your weight is too much or too little the bill's are piling up the girlfriend or boyfriend has dumped you or you just can't seem to get it right what ever it is.Look no matter what suicide is not an option your life has more meaning than just you it benefits others wether you realize it or not [more often not] those pills your taking you may want to look them up a lot of depression and anxiety pills are related to this type of thinking sometimes it helps me to remind myself that this life has a purpose that someday it will all end and a new more joyful life will come about but then I'm a strong believer in christianity but even if your not remember everything you go through in life only benefits you at the very least you gain knowledge about how better to solve an issue and again your importance for being here will reveal itself because you can share your info with others. Talk to your doctor about your problem he will probably put you on some new meds. God Bless|`|WEM5n41Oaa	You might have bipolar disorder if you are experiencing high and low moods.  Maybe your on the wrong meds and they need to be changed a little bit.  Talk to you psychiatrist.
OBT3C4zHaa	You can try Sudafed but get the one you need to ask at the counter for. The one on the shelves has been proven to be little more than placebo. The main ingredient in the one you want is Pseudoephedrine. Or you can try SudafedOM which contains OxyMetazoline but you're not supposed to take that for more than 3 or 4 days.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	A pot of boiling water with a drop of eucalyptus oil.

2JNqGODDaa	Its obvious that your boyfriend is depressed. And if he is getting suicidal, it mean he has gone through a very bad situation in recent past. So what I suggest you to do is just get him into a good conversation and try to understand what exactly is it. Make him feel that you are there with him no matter what. Don't ask him directly whats bothering him but try speaking to him about various things like office or any friend. And if he denies speaking on any of the topics that means thats where the problem is. I know you cant take him for a holiday but at least you can change his mood by taking him out for dinner or just going to a nearby place and spend time with him. Do things that he likes. Also, for his safety don't keep poisonous things around. If you have a gun or similar weapon in house then you better hide it. Also, knives and other sparp object should also be kept under locks when you know about the situation. Don't let him get up in the night. Ensure he is on the bed with you all the time. All the best sweety, I hope the bad phase burts away like water bubble.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	you have got to get him to the doctor right away get him on the right medication|`|WEM5n41Oaa	He sounds depressed but it may be because of something that happened recently in his life.  He may not have clinical depression.  Maybe he just needs some time to heal.  You might want to suggest that he starts working less.  Probably the best thing you can do is talk to him.  Find out what's bothering him so much.  Maybe he needs to see a psychiatrist.  Meds can help.|`|Uv6kV5rLaa	You could suggest a vacation or at least a weekend road trip. It sounds to me like there is more than just problems at work going on but either way, a change from the daily grind does anyone and everyone loads of good. Good luck to you.

SCD6Pdtnaa	I definitely recommend taking some classes. After you are familiar with the postures, you can practice at home, too, but having a live teacher is best so they can make corrections. <br>  <br>  Look for studios in your area online. A lot of studios have beginner packages so you can try out the different types of yoga they offer and different teachers. Often, these are punch cards - 5 classes for $30 or something, and you can go any time you want so you can find the classes you like.<br>  <br>  You can also check out your local rec. center. A lot of these also offer yoga classes, often drop-in, and also often cheaper than a yoga studio.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say how much it will cost. It varies pretty widely depending where you live, how many yoga studios there, and even the type of yoga. Even if it's pricey for you, you may only need to pay for 10-20 classes before you have enough of an understanding to practice at home, at which point it will be free!<br>  <br>  Tips for yoga - remember that every body is different, and not only are some ppl more flexible than others, but you'll also find this within your own body. For example, your hips might be flexible, but not your shoulders. Be patient with yourself and be open to trying new things.|`|5bjm3qesaa	i started at home 5 years ago, since i received a park of 'yoga cards' for christmas one year- they had the instructions on one side and a diagram/picture on the back, plus a short introduction to yoga. i found these to be extremely useful for describing how to do each pose and have been practising ever since!<br>  <br>  however it's been said that there are certain poses that are potentially harmful and cause injury if one does not have the instruction of a proper experienced teacher, such as the shoulderstand and headstand. apart from this though i would definitely recommend starting it at home if you are motivated enough! and if you don't know of any yoga classes. in england, they cost on average about 5 pounds but can be less or more. good luck!|`|A9WCbC8aaa	I have been doing a form of yoga called YRG for the last 6 months in my home.  It is a great workout and my back has never felt better.  I went to a class but as a newbie I was sensitve because I was not as flexible as everyone else and kept struggling to keep my balance.  Now I bet I could go into that class and do well but I like doing it at home.  There are DVD's but I do the online version I found at the site below.  Good Luck!|`|sDwNAKwsaa	You can learn at home or Online.. there are several websites offers Yoga information one of which i know is a2zofyoga.com|`|uyfTeiyraa	Doing it at home by yourself isn't as effective. I've done classes and done it by myself, and the classes are better because the instructor is constantly reminding you to breathe, and making sure you hold the postures, and you don't have to think too much about what you're doing next. Since you can't take a class, you should go to Wal-Mart or Target and buy a DVD.<br>  **EDIT**<br>  I don't know how much it costs, you could join a gym that offers yoga classes, I don't think it's too expensive. A DVD would be like, $10 or something though haha.|`|4QiVYcviaa	You can learn yoga at home and achieve many good results..

You defiantly have to workout your back cuz they're the second biggest muscle in your body to get stronger.. But for those that u plateau change the barbell bench to dumbell for a few weeks and for the bicep change it up to, ex preacher curls, cable curl concentration or hammer curls, for tricep change it up to, ex skull crusher close grip bench press tricep pushdown, tricep extension or tricep overhead when you plateau change up you workout.. So DO NOT FORGET TO WORK YOUR BACK AND SHOULDER ALSO|`|Gsqt4ODYaa	i had this same problem too, i recently just overcame the plateau by doing my workout in reverse.<br>  <br>  I used to do bench, 10 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2, moving up every time in weight, but then i started at my top, going down, and i'd do like 3 - 4 - 6 - 6 - 6, and after a week of that, my max went up 30 pounds, no joke.

That doesn't sound too big to me, especially since you are still developing. Talk to your doctor about weight or better yet don't worry about numbers, worry about your activity level and healthy eating. Starving yourself now or trying to diet too young can lead to health and weight issues later on in life. I know! I am 5'10" and used to model - got down to a size 3 and now I can't get below a 12 because I was obsessed with the scale.

dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Being that you only got your period a few months ago, perhaps your body is still going through puberty. I would wait a year and see if they develop on their own - they very well may "round-out" on their own. Hang in there. The more money you have the better the boob job. Spend at least $3500 on each boob for the best results.|`|N1ay8hzFaa	Just wait. If you just started getting your period, then you still have plenty of time to grow and for your breasts to change.

XUrgcOMDaa	All those things are normal... and explainable.<br>  <br>  Your sinuses run all over your face... they run by your ears, nose, throat, forehead, cheeks and eyes.  So, naturally a sinus infection can affect all of these areas.<br>  <br>  The dizziness is caused by the imbalance of pressure in your inner ears.  The sore throat is caused by your sinuses draining into your throat, and that is a bacteria culturing "hotspot".  The flu-like symptoms are also caused by your sinuses draining... into your stomach.  Yes, it's gross but true.<br>  <br>  Sometimes sinusitis is caused by bacteria, in which case an antibiotic will help... but sometimes it's caused by a virus... in which case you pretty much have to wait it out.  Only your doctor can tell for sure, by doing a culture sample.  Usually, though, you can get a pretty good idea if it's bacteria, because your phlegm will be yellow or green.  But this is not a 100% sure way to tell, as it can be inconsistent.<br>  <br>  I recommend chamomile tea to make you feel better.  And chicken soup.  Homemade chicken soup.  And rest, of course!|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	normal.  hope you feel better.|`|5kUxkun3aa	have you spoken to your doctor about your vision? i would get checked out.

Though not clearly understood this is in some way related to the hormone changes that occur during the menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  It used to be thought that Evening Primrose or its active ingredient Epogram or gamolenic acid helped with this, but like many other claims made for this substance evidence based studies failed to bare this out and it appears no better than placebo.<br>  <br>  Antispasmodics or anti inflammatory drugs can help the pain of cramps and there is evidence that Vitamin B6 , pyridoxine in quite high dose  can help with the mood problems.<br>  <br>  Some studies show progesterone to be useful, though others have failed to demostrate this, the combined pill has also been used and does seem to help some women.

F12ekJ7Saa	The brown discharge could be just old blood, which is very normal. The pill can cause spotting but that only happens when you start taking the pill or if you have stopped for a while and then started taking it again. Now I know this may not be the reason why you are spotting but have you thought maybe you are pregnant? Wait and see if you get your period by the end of the pack. If not I would think that it could most definitely be pregnancy. Even if you did use protection, remember its not 100% safe. Good luck and I wish you the best. Let me know what happens (if you want).

Nq4FWEIcaa	If you were not circumcised your entire penis would be more uniform in color.  Once the foreskin was removed it revealed a lighter shade of skin underneath.  The dark ring is where the circumcision was made.|`|hLOYwnsUaa	Yeah its because your circumcised, from where the doctor cut the foreskin is where you can see a the difference in the colors.  i|`|5Cqa6sJyaa	Me 3!

It's a normal side-effect of the procedure.<br>  <br>  I'm uncircumcised and fairly light-skinned, but even in my case, the "outer" part of my foreskin is darker than the "inner" pink part. But the transition between the two takes place over several inches of foreskin, rather than a single dividing line.

pRF5LLloaa	My information shows that Apidra, Novolog, and Humulog are all equivalent, chemically.<br>  <br>  There MAY be differences is dosages due to the concentration of insulin in the mixture, so there is NO REASON to believe that 1ml of Apidra is the same as 1ml of Humulog or 1ml of Novolog, though.  <br>  <br>  The three medications canNOT be directly interchanged without  adjustment of dosages!<br>  <br>  If YOU prefer one brand over another, ask you doctor to prescribe the brand YOU like.  Your doctor can make the appropriate dosage adjustments.

People who have suffered from anorexia are also at high risk for developing diabetes.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Hmm I don't know what it could be, but you should see a doctor.

u7rKcdtWaa	Well Congrats on wanting some help, that is an awesome first step. It is usually not a good thing to want to increase someones "will power" for all that does is increase the resistance to what ever it is you would like to accomplish. If you think about it what is will power but a internal force to overcome an internal resistance.... so if you increase one then you will increase the other most times or you will get tired because it is a battle within kinda stuff!<br>  How about increasing your motivation? Now there seems to be an effective way to get things accomplished! How does one go about increasing their motivation? Here are a few tips I give all my clients:<br>  1) Remember a time when you felt motivated, inspired and as you do that check on is the MEMORY in your minds eye black & white or colour? is it a still picture or is it like a movie? is there sound? these are all important in how YOU become motivated!2) As you relive that memory notice where you begin to "feel" motivated in your body... All emotions have a place where they live in us, so you might as well discover where this emotion lives so you can make it bigger, or more powerful when you need it. 3) as you have done these things now go and apply them to your list one at a time, making sure that they are in colour or that they are full view  or what ever it was that you discovered from before. <br>  <br>  Be Well <br>  <br>  Kevin|`|58e95a5bcb9b3b1cb28831601a8bb259aa	If you find a good answer email me because I  always get motivation but than run out of it like hummer runs out of gas.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	sallow up some ritalin and watch what happens ...u will be chinese japnese tokyo and all the asians in the world in few hours|`|T64zP6fgaa	Yep, there is free effective amazing help at www.emofree.com   it works, I use it....you are welcome!  try it! pass it forward|`|A6SsbESGaa	I don't think you can..i have tried everything too.

A90lbgZ7aa	Apparently the is no real reason not to drink while on this medication however people have experienced the mother of hangovers the following day. Its your decision|`|UFu0h8SKaa	hiya, i took them for about 12 months, and at first they made me feel very ill but after a week or so (as i remember) i was feeling great! I don't think you're supposed to drink on them, but i did and i didn't get a hangover at all, it was great! I'd be surprised if you feel like drinking that much so soon, but if you do i'm sure you'll be ok. Just take it easy and if you start feeling ill don't bother. I also found them very difficult to come off of. I felt very ill without them. I had to start taking them again and i had to hide it from my husband, cos he said i had to stop taking them. Good luck, have a good night!

KzmrWzOJaa	I dont know about slimshots. but I can tell you that you should drink Green Tea with every meal, and dont drink any soda or anything that has a lot of sugar, Also, for most people, it takes at least 60 min. of cardio exercise at a moderate to intese rate 5 times a week to actually loose weight. Looking for your ideal weight? try this:<br>  <a href="http://www.shape.com/fitness_tools/ideal_weight/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shape.com/fitness_tools/ideal...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shape.com/fitness_tools/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shape.com/fitness_tools/bmi/</a>|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Of course they do. Don't you see how quickly the cartoon character loses weight? Just before the fine print of "with diet and exercise". <br>  <br>  Also, your husband already thinks you look amazing. At least I'm assuming he does. If not, then there might be a problem. Since he probably does, then don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  I don't diet. I've never been one to do so. My whole, real, natural food choices are my life. It's part of who I am. I actually weigh less now than what I did when we married seven and a half years ago, because of lifestyle changes. When we married I wasn't conscious of my food choices.Now, I consider myself a conscious, ethical (as ethical as possible) eater. I became vegan for ethical reasons regarding the animals, factory farms and the care of the earth. I also became educated about what is and isn't in conventional food as well. I now do everything within my power to avoid enrichred flour (fancy wording for white), corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated oils, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, artificial flavors and anything that looks as though it was created in a lab by humans and not in nature by God. When we married I was six feet 175-180. Now, I'm down to about 155. (This morning the scale said 154.) Except for playing with my 17-month old daughter and chasing her around the house, I don't really exercise. In the old days I did yoga and walked seven miles and my body did look good from my taking care of it. Now, I'm just skinny and in not as good of shape. <br>  <br>  I think all of those weight loss supplements (diet pills, Slim Shots, the other diet product commercial with animation...) are mostly gimmicks.|`|80Zlwifsaa	For one Acai berry is a scam don't waste your money, and I have heard slim shots do not work either. Just watch what you eat, watch your sugar intake and do some exercise, I know it sucks but diets don't work and usually supplements don't either. Just do it the natural way because you can't be on a "diet" the rest of your life.

aDhZIhQcaa	My daughter had the same problem.  It depends on your bone frame.  If you have a large bone frame, watch out...you will have a tendency to gain and keep weight.  Medium bone frames also have a tendency to do the same thing but not on an obese level.  Small bone frames will gain some weight, but not very often.  To check to see which one you have....put your middle finger and thumb around your wrist on the opposite hand, if youir finger and thumb overlap...you have a small bone frane, if they just touch....you have a medium bone frame, if they are apart, at all, you have a large bone frame.  <br>  Also, yoiur metabolism has a lot to do with it.  Just stay active without overdoing it.  Cut your fat intake in half....Normal daily intake of fat is 30grams.  So cut down to 15grams daily.  And don't eat fast foods.  It is a proven fact that fast food is the major cause of obesity in America.  It is killing children.  And don't be so hard on yourself, once you get all the way through puberty, you will be fine.|`|WogL0UpOaa	You really need to listen to your mum.

It could be because you have a very high metabolism. I would suggest a really good multivitamin, a healthy diet of whole, unprocessed foods (fruits and veggies, lean meats, whole grains, nuts, legumes, eggs, probiotic yogurt). Make sure you eat every few hours if you feel an energy drop. I'd also suggest trying protein shakes, whey protein unless you are allergic, then I would go with a good soy or hemp one. Protein shakes are easy to make; just get some good quality protein powder and blend with soy milk or milk, fruit like frozen berries and maybe a fresh peach or banana(s), perhaps add in some good healthy omega-3 oils such as flax seed oil or Udo's oil blend...I also add cinnamon and fresh spinach to mine, but you don';t have to, you can keep it really simple.<br>  Along with a good healthy diet, no junk food, it's important to work out regularly to build muscle, and try and use your protein shakes right after the workout to speed the recovery and help with muscle repair.<br>  Drink lots of water. I'm not sure what your diet is like right now, but you might not be eating enough protein, although be sure to balance that out with some good healthy salads and lots of veggies as well.<br>  I hope I helped; it can be just as challenging for someone to try and gain weight as for a person trying to lose weight. <br>  Best of luck, I hope you do well :)<br>  Take care|`|oGbHyZR8aa	I am 18 and quite tall (for a girl) and very skinny as well.

Please talk to your doctor about it, even though she is a female. She will understand, I promise. I know it's not a comfortable discussion, but we're talking about your body and body image here. Once you become sexually active it could cause problems in terms of pain. I think if you can see a urologist (a specialized doc who works in with this area of the body) to take care of it (generally a surgical outpatient procedure), so much better for your life as an adult male.

The patient MUST develop a strong sens of self-discipline in order to maintain the diet, make the daily measurements, and take the injections, but that self-discipline  is ALSO necessary in the case of a transplant, and in the case of a transplant failure to meet the proper self-discipline goals is much more urgent and immediately fatal.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Make a commitment to train for three days a week. Alternate between longer and shorter runs. also do not forget to stretch and always drink water before and after your work out to prevent cramping. <br>  ALWAYS warm up before you stretch. If you don't warm up first stretching will be ineffective. Proper stretching is key to avoiding injury. <br>  After a minimum of one month of base work, averaging three hours per week running, start following this weekly schedule or finish it without rest days: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Day 1 - Tempo run. Warm up 10 minutes. Run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 2 - Rest day <br>  Day 3 - Easy 30 minute run <br>  Day 4 - 40/20s. Warm up 10 minutes, 12 cycles of Sprint 40 seconds, jog 20 seconds. Cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 5 - Rest day <br>  Day 6 - Long run. Start slowly and run conversational pace for 40-90 minutes. It is helpful to have a running buddy or friend/spouse/kid willing to toodle along on a bike. <br>  Day 7 - Rest day. <br>  Try challenging yourself once every two weeks or so with this technique: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a local track (1/4 mile) or flat surface (1/4 mile) to run on. <br>  Stretch and do a light warm up (e.g. 25 jumping jacks or a light jog). <br>  Do a 1/4 mile sprint followed by a 1/4 mile jog. Do the sprint & jog routine for at least 2 miles. <br>  if you do a 5k for instance, make sure you have a lot of speedwork, then long distance. you can increase your speedwork-outs by taking off time not distance, do not just start doing hard workouts, make sure you have about 1-2 months of running before you start speedwork. for the first month or so, do about 1-4 easy; walk it if you want. <br>  Beat your own time. Once you have your initial time, you do not want to go below it. At least maintain an average time. <br>  pace your self, if your doing a 5k workout you can pace your self according to your mile pace. <br>  Do a cool down. After every run, you do not want to just stop running. Walk the run off till your heart rate is moderate. Then stretch. Stretching is very important after running. If you don't stretch, you will start getting pains in your feet for the next few days and it will be a bit difficult to walk. Some good stretches are flamingos, and touching your feet while standing up. Also to alter this stretch, grab your toes and try to straighten out your knees. It really stretches your hamstrings. <br>  Increasing your upper body strength by lifting weights is a good way to build speed to run faster. The lower back and shoulder are also important. Exercises like pull ups, sit ups, and push ups to improve core strength are important to good running. Do not do heavy exercises like squats, leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, and calf raises, lunges every day, as they tend to overwork your legs. The added leg strength is not worth being injured frequently. Instead, do 2-3 one minute reps of wall-sits two times a week along with lunges with light weights or a medicine ball. <br>  Make a commitment. Do not quit your regimen, do not tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow, do not tell yourself you're too tired, and do not tell yourself you're too busy. Run in the morning to get it over with. <br>  but remember just have fun, running is fun!!!! <br>  Thirty years of competitive distance running and research on exercise physiology boil down to a few essentials. The key is to start slowly and work your way up gradually.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Video  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsAfter warming up, do about 40-50 crunches to get your abdominal muscles firm and stretched. This will help run faster. <br>  Purchase gear from a shop where the staff are knowledgeable (generally staff in large commercial stores are not as knowledgeable as those in smaller specialty stores). Invest in good training shoes that are both light and comfortable. Running shoes without sufficient cushioning can cause shin splints and other injuries. Replace shoes every 300 miles or if they're deformed in any way. <br>  When you are ready to race, pick a local race with a distance less than or equal to your standard long run. Cut back 50% the week before. Run no faster than your tempo pace the first half and see how many people you can pass in the second half of the race. <br>  Try "Pack Running" where you find someone you think is around you running level, and run along with them can be helpful to keeping a good pace. <br>  Stretching is the most important thing you can do. It will prevent you from getting sore and makes you more flexible. You should stretch before and after a race to reduce the risk of soreness. <br>  If you are not used to running, afterwards you will be painfully sore. Suggested is Sports cream, for aching muscles. It works without the awful smell. <br>  Recovering is also very important. If you do a hard workout one day, you get better by making sure that your next day is easy and you stretch a lot. Also after running make sure to cool down by jogging lightly for 2 to 6 minutes. This loosens muscles after a hard work out. <br>  Time sprinting and jogging by usi|`|8SRjELNBaa	get a dynamic warmup...|`|rP1WwvnVaa	all you can really do is practice.  Try doing some sprints everyday.  Once you build up your agility, it will probably be easier for you to loosen up faster.
SlPncQjcaa	Don't want to scare you love, but it sounds like you may be pregnant.  I am no doctor of course, and I know you're scared, and I'm not trying to be condescending and patronizing like some of the other answers, but you seriously could be pregnant. Take a pregnancy test (or a few) to either confirm that or rule it out.  No matter what the test says, go to the doctor.  Of course if the test is positive, you'll have to visit the doctor anyway.  If you are pregnant, congrats!!!! If not, I hope you find the source of the problem and get well.  Many women experience a few months without a period without the pregnancy factor.  It's quite normal from what I hear from others even though I haven't experienced it myself.  You may have some digestive or colon problems (assuming you're not pregnant) to address your other symptoms.  I wouldn't advise you to take any medications to solve the other problems because you very well could be pregnant and need to stay away from certain medications and chemicals.  Either way, get a professional opinion from a doctor and get well.  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|CcR9kvHhaa	You're pregnant...<br>  <br>  But the lump, it's not so much a lump it's just the fat beneath your skin.

There is also an E45 shower gel and bath oil, which will help you avoid drying the patches out when you wash.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't help, and the patches are annoying you, you can see your doctor.

hjDZmXAQaa	I think different people struggle more on different machines, but the key is to do something that feels hard (as opposed to what feels comfortable).<br>  <br>  I started jogging for the first time, and at first I could only jog a few blocks.  I tried to push it past the moment when I was dying to stop (make myself go on another minute or so), and when I got comfortable with the new time, I'd push it a minute further.  That way, I went from jogging 5 blocks to jogging 20 blocks in my neighbourhood. <br>  <br>  So my advice is to choose one or two machines that feel challenging to you, and push it past your comfort level a little more each time.|`|jgpESnd7aa	machines ? ..you don't need machines to increase your stamina.<br>  <br>  In short I'd love to introduce our US based company - 29 yrs history, present in 70 countries which makes nutrition based products which could help you attain.<br>  ? improved energy, <br>  ? weight control, <br>  ? general wellness <br>  If this strikes a chord of interest with you then we should talk more. <br>  I can forward to you more details and information.<br>  <br>  kevinrebello@live.it<br>  Milan, ITALY|`|kvog6ICCaa	Anything that involves a constant motion, especially at an increased speed.

xIlIbZJtaa	Maybe they mean that your lack of sleep is affecting your school work and therefore you are 'destroying your life' by not achieving so well as you would otherwise. I dont know without more details but I do know that although its not exactly life threatening, its not very good for your mind body or spirit to have that little sleep. <br>  Lack of sleep at any age is going to make any problem at least a hundred times worse (most people are emotional wrecks with lack of sleep) but the only way you're going to get a good nights sleep is to sort your issues out. <br>  I think its really hard growing up, but learning to deal with your stress now is going to help you so much in your life. So you need to deal with that stuff thats bothering you with school because its building up inside you and it won't just go away on its own. <br>  Talk! Sometimes problems are major but they can always always be sorted one way or another if you get the right help from a friend, parent or teacher.<br>  Take some form of exercise straight after school so that by night time your body is tired, even if your brain isn't.<br>  Get some music that you find relaxing, (not necessarily traditionally relaxing as you might find it annoying), but whats relaxing for you personally.<br>  Try writing things down your feelings and worries and throwing them away. <br>  Good luck. <br>  We all go through this but it always works out in the end, ok? xxx :-)|`|dkgTuPOQaa	staying up late will definetley give you issues at school, if grades and classes are the problem. just try to disrupt yor normal evening and get rid of all distractions, and just lie in your bed and read somthing really boring, sometimes I do that and it works|`|neUiCEB3aa	Haha you're not "destroying" your life. <br>  <br>  But you really should try to get more sleep. Lack of sleep weakens your immune system so that you're more likely to become sick.<br>  <br>  If you're stressed, figure out what's making you stressed, and try to make a plan to fix it somehow. Also, try taking a break and relax by listening to music or reading or watching a t.v. show.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better.|`|6EIhzsqoaa	Try to find things to do that will relax you & tire you out, rather than doing something that really interests you which won't help you sleep. Get comfortable & read a boring book?  You'll be asleep within minutes.  Do somethignthat doesnt take so much concentration though. Hope this helps =)  Whatever you do, NO MEDS.|`|i5H1CNgOaa	Sleep deprivation is very serious and it could hurt you. Teenagers should sleep at least eight hours each night. To relieve the stress, yoga, or another exercise, eating right, calm music, and or a good nights sleep should help. But you should talk to a doctor about it.
6P27whuGaa	I thought it was going to fall off.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Haha my worst experience,<br>  I was young, maybe 12, and hopping from thing to thing on the playground. Some how I slipped and ended up landing my vagina, right on top of the heel of my own foot (with the shoe still on) I can say to this date, It was the most painful thing I'vee ever experienced.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine was goofing around at school. (Dont ask me how she did it, but this is what she told me) She was wearing a skirt that day and somehow fell. She landed, somehow on top of a chair leg, and the leg went right up her vagina. She had to be rushed to the hospital, lots of blood.|`|kDvKc3npaa	YES.!<br>  My best friend did it cause she thought it would be funny.<br>  <br>  i was standing in front of her talking and she just kicked me. it hurt like a b*tch and i was on my period so that was even worse.|`|c8tyG5z3aa	It can hurt depending on how hard you're kicked and where around there you're kicked. It basically just hurts like being kicked or hurt on any other part of the body. And the vagina is an internal organ, so I'm sure if it was on the outside it would hurt a LOT more XD<br>  <br>  Now being kicked or punched in the BOOBS... THAT hurts haha. It's like the female version of the balls. <br>  I mean I'm sure it's not as painful but it still hurts more than being kicked in the vag.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Very painful physically,no real emotional experience except tears.|`|TC6Fmugcaa	i know someone who kicked my friend's vag and it made her start her period|`|hyY9Vw1Waa	Yeah, I forgot I had a penis.|`|9cLkF6wqaa	it hurts like getting kicked anywhere else on our body except our boobs, unless were on our period, then it hurts more, but ya, its not anything special, but its not like were numb down there :o well hopefully|`|pf2QP0BNaa	Emotional?! TEARS|`|6x99ue8maa	wtf lol hurt real bad|`|BLQKJOhkaa	yea by a soccer ball. doesnt hurt that bad....at least for a girl anyway.|`|2eALO9qzaa	my brother pushed me on the treadmill and i fell on my vigina and i bled alot...it hurt so bad and for months
IMPvzBk1aa	I assume you stopped giving the amoxicillin, so the symptoms should improve.  Often the first time an allergy to a drug manifests, it is a milder one.  Be sure he does not receive this drug again in the future, because his body will be ready to launch a major response if there is a second exposure to the drug.  I would still keep a watchful eye for the next 24 hours, and if the rash continues to worsen, if he develops a fever, or especially if he shows any breathing difficulty, get him to the doctor.|`|dksB1B0Laa	probably take the baby to the doctor<br>  before it gets any worse!|`|cf964f397f88b1d3fbbad5f9441599b0aa	Probably just a mild allergic reaction and it probably won't get any worse.  A lot of people are allergic to Penicillin derivatives (like Amoxicillin).  I'm allergic to Sulfa, another kind of antibiotic, and had a similar reaction the first time I took it, just a mild rash but it wasn't bothersome and I otherwise felt fine.  Just keep an eye on it and if he starts to scratch or acts fussy, then call the doctor and ask for advice.  You might ask if he can take an antihistamine, like Benadryl, to help if he's itchy.  Otherwise, it should clear up on its own in a few days.  Remember to report it any time you have to give his medical history.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|EP71VvGXaa	more than enough  you actually might want to slow it down an spread it out|`|6GJumHfgaa	Corn flakes are garbage. They will not help you lose weight. Substitute them for oatmeal...the REAL kind. Not instant. Corn flakes break down way too quickly, making you hungry again shortly after. Oatmeal keeps your metabolism working throughout the day, and keeps you full for much longer. Loosin too much weight at once is useless, because you cant last very long on such an extreme regime (haha, it rhymes)...and you will just end up gaining it all back. A slow weight loss program will be much more beneficial.|`|kjRmm28oaa	It really all depends on your body chemistry. Everybody's bodies lose weight at different rates and in different places. Your best bet would be to just do it and see what happens. You just need to make sure you don't consume too few of calories or else your body will turn it into fat instead of using it! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|U7SnmcxYaa	Do the math yourself, lazy bum hehe.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	maybe you should focus on your grammar first|`|eYiYCnb5aa	Okay well first off, you cannot just eat fruits, vegs, and cornflakes....<br>  <br>  The key to losing weight is eating in smaller proportions and only cutting out their intake of certain foods.<br>  <br>  Plus, if you want to burn fat a lot faster, Cardio is the best workout for burning fat.<br>  <br>  That includes, walking, jogging, running, biking, dancing, aerobics.<br>  Seriously everything i have read, and everyone who i have asked would tell you the same thing, that Cardio is the fastest way to lose weight.<br>  But, its not healthy to lose more than 3 to 5 lbs a week.|`|AA11168446	You have to eat to lose weight. You need to stay hydrated so drink water.  Depending on your current weight you will probably want about 2000 calories per day of food.  If you exercise 5 times in that week for about one hour each time you will burn about 600 claories per hour or about 3000 for the week.  1 pound = 3500 calories. .  So the exercise will keep drop about 1 pound.  If you are eating 3000 calories per day and cut back to the 2000 you will save 7000 calories or another two pounds.  Bottome line....2-3 pounds gone this week.  Now, if this is at the start of a diet and you are significantly overweight the wight loss could be more.  However, safe weight loss is about 2-3 pounds per week.  I suggest you consult a doctor before you significantly mdoify your behavior or if you have other health probelms to consider first.|`|EefwsHv8aa	First off that's not a very healthy way to lose weight....you still need to add protein and some carbs into your diet if you want to have enough energy to keep up with the workouts....this isn't a diet that you can stick to for more than 2-3 weeks im guessing.<br>  <br>  but you would probably lose about 2 lbs. because even though your going to be working out really hard, you'll be burning fat, but youll be adding muscle (which weighs more).<br>  so dont reference your scale, use how you fit into your pants and such as a referance point instead.|`|UZ0NBusaaa	Probably eight pounds at most, anything much higher would be unhealthy. <br>  <br>  Btw, why two bowls of cornflakes, just have one and eat fruits and vegetables. You can also eat normal meals, just don't eat too much.|`|2vBmRcv6aa	I think that about 3000 calories equals 1 pound but it depends on you.<br>  I use fatsecret.com, you can record what you eat and it tells you the total. Also can enter your activities and it tells you about what your burning.<br>  fitday.com does the same thing.|`|vAAGriFkaa	It's gonna take more than that...<br>  loosing weight needs persistency, even if you loose a couple of kilograms in that week, what good is it if you gain back 3 a week later?<br>  <br>  besides, it depends on your weight, metabolism, fat percent & if you are a man or a woman.|`|mlDCqCpgaa	ive counted and you will lose about 6 pound. Dont feel bad you might not be used to working out so ur body wont lose much but if u do this for 1 month ull see GREAT results|`|MSDlHrMTaa	maybe 10 pounds depends on how commited you are 13 pounds at most|`|JQcxBneGaa	visit a doctor and he see you diet<br>  <a href="http://www.bukisa.com/articles/39633_a-humble-brazilian-woman" rel="nofollow">http://www.bukisa.com/articles/39633_a-h...</a>|`|wxil7JB8aa	it depends on how fast your metabolism is|`|trrjxPxiaa	there's really no way for us to answer that by the information you gave.
kvWF1a2Yaa	Should tell them that you should charge THEM a fee for waiting so long. I would explain it to them that you couldnt wait that long. Then tell them to waive the fee or youll find another dentist,|`|MPX0f5jzaa	I would raise hell, that's just such a dirty practice to begin with!|`|YrD8AxmQaa	What time did you arrive?  If you were there at 10:50 then the other posters have good comments.  But if you were late for your appointment by even 5 minutes and the dentist moved onto the next patients and saw you as soon as he or she was free, then there isn't much you can do.  Also, did you tell the receptionist you were leaving?  If you just stormed out, then their records will show you as a no-show if there was no complaint made at the time.<br>  <br>  You can complain to your state's regulatory body, but make sure that your case is solid first because the first thing they'll do is pull the dentist's records|`|lz2hw676aa	Tell them you were at your appt at the time you were supposed to be and waited an hour thereafter.  You did not break your appt.  Unless you signed some sort of contract with tricky wording....I wouldn't pay them and I would dispute it. Ask to speak with the owner himself and explain nicely....Otherwise if it seems like you are not going to win this issue...you can either dispute the charges when it hits your credit report...you would have to call the credit reporting agencies and file your claim and they will have to see if it is false....or just pay the $35 and never go back to this dentist again.  I would say take it to court but the costs might be more than $35 and time consuming.  If you can't talk your way out of it with the owner, just pay the $35 dollars...whether in installments or all at once and CHANGE your DENTIST!!!!|`|UL3XOKJxaa	Don't pay it and gp to another dentist. That is one of the most ludicrous things I have ever heard of...I can guarantee they will not be able to collect it from you. Dentist like that give dentistry a bad name. Good Luck
FIWB7Dgtaa	feels like biting ur tongue. except for a longer period of time-a day or so. <br>  its a pretty big needle so if ur gonna get freaked out by just that then u shouldnt do it. the clamp that they use hurts worse tho.<br>  dont get it just to be cool-u will regret it and itll be a waste of money.<br>  they give u listerine to numb and disinfect it beforehand.|`|P6LJBVdtaa	i have never pierced my tongue sooo yeah i would say the tongue|`|MOOXskguaa	The tongue of course.|`|iphzNLB4aa	your tongue because it has more nerves
tIldpr7vaa	well sorry but diet is the KEY to losing fat. Lots of cardio will also help<br>  <br>  i would avoid working with weights, cause they wont burn off ur arm fat ( u CANT  target fat loss by working the muscle underneath, thats a myth) and u will build muscle and theyll look even bigger|`|g4l2VHYGaa	lots of push ups, use weights, buy a curl up bar do some curl ups.|`|W33gCtiVaa	if u have chubby arms like i do usually if you lift weights your arms can become skinnier and you could build up more muscle usually 5 -10 lbs. would do it|`|xzR3H2gYaa	Do strength training like weight lifting but dont lift heavy weights because you will bulk up but just enough that it will tone your arms.|`|D1UKyUeTaa	Then get fat. Eat stuff kids would eat.
928YGlFgaa	i would not recommend using table salt. i too, got my belly button pierced and have had it pierced for a little over a month now. mine is not infected, and for the first 2 weeks i had to clean it twice a day, and after two weeks i could clean it once.<br>  <br>  try using wound spray, it comes in a compressed can from CVS, (its a cvs brand) and it costs roughly around 10 dollars. it doesn't sting or hurt at all, and i think it really does work because i have not had an infection yet. buy q-tips too, and spray the solution on the q-tip and use the q-tip to clean it.<br>  <br>  i think table salt will hurt your piercing even more, so i would stick with sea salt and warm water, or the compressed can method from CVS, it really works.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	NO,  wash with soap and water and use bacitracin !<br>  <br>  why on earth are you using saline solution ?  that goes inyour eyes only|`|VUEvviKzaa	I did that before and it helped me.|`|5TAQgcrpaa	lmao yer supposed to use warm water & dial soap or something antibacterial sillyy.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	no sea salt only! You could always use warm soap and water.
DQoRqMUIaa	you should get it checked out right away! you should also educate yourself alot on anal because you could do alot of damage to your body.|`|iEBrqir2aa	You should get it checked out and take better precaution when taking it in the pooper.  Otherwise you could have some serious intestinal problems. Ask your dad to take you. It could be that nothing is wrong and your butt is just sore. Good Luck!|`|gLgt1UlKaa	straight to the doc and be more careful next time - lots of lube and take it slowly
AA10663432	My "guess" is that the sport bra (as most do) flatten you out that when you see yourself without it the Girls just look bigger.|`|muHctmaGaa	Certainly not.|`|1aJjFrUCaa	sports bra. has nothing to do with your boobs growing|`|v12UVWSNaa	uh no.. sports bras actually flatten ur breasts, has nothing to do with them getting bigger...|`|sfwfOG0caa	nope, maybe ur growing still, if ur too old to be still growin then ur gettin fatter. Uh  oh!|`|sfzZZolSaa	No way they flaten your boobs|`|bJsmOgRvaa	it has nothing to do with your breasts growing..<br>  they probably just grew by themselves<br>  but if your lookin to ake them LOOK bigger then wear a push up

It's a prescription but it works great.|`|sG6TocPeaa	If its ur first time using something like this I would say use concerta instead of adderall. Adderall is more likely for dependancy and it is not time released, so u will feeling kinda shitty afterwards, as opposed to concerta which will release over about a 4 hour period|`|0SAYzdFYaa	You should try adderall.

9vBqgoDfaa	If the bleeding in his eye is really intense, he should get his eye checked. The bleeding can be on the outside but the INSIDE of his eye can be seriously hurt, and without care, he could lose his eye. The problems he could have are all caused by his fight.|`|bOjO5qyKaa	Chances are fairly good that it's a harmless hemorrhage of some blood vessels in the thin outer layer of tissue covering the white part of the eye. As time passes, the blood covers a larger area and darkens, so it looks worse before it starts to look better.  But trauma can cause much more serious complications, so macho man really needs to see an eye doctor.  If the blood is behind the cornea (the clear part of the eye in front of the colored part), that's serious and requires medical attention.
LHzlvfRQaa	Phone your doctor and tell them that the pain is getting worse and you need attention immediately. When you phone back tell them you don't want to talk to a nurse you want to see the doctor immediately. If they won't get you in immediately go to a doctor who will. <br>  Phone the hospital that did the surgery and tell them what you have just told us.

When they are filling your tooth it might hurt a little too but as i said it iznt as bad as you think.<br>  Also if you close your eyes through the whole thing u dont have to see the shot-needle thing or anything, and it helps :]]

gXRpOzhGaa	bro.. that all depends on how you eat at the time you are growing. NOW! Age 12-19. So if you really want a natural growth all over your body, firstly you got to exercise more at this age and eat more proteins so your body will grow well, not just your penis but that will grow better. Stay AWAY from sugar and candy for awhile too.  I do want to warn you, making an importance of growing a huge penis can be alot of trouble in this day and age and that means STDs are running rampant like you're playing pac-man. I would consider with good health, safety and sticking with one woman so you do not regret later having such a thing. It may feel nice but when you are on your death bed you will wish you didnt.  <br>  <br>  But yes growing takes eating the right foods at the right times and if you want a larger size, then just be sure that everything grows well and eat herbs and veggies and exercise well and stay fit and you will see all your good parts grow well. Don't take pills pls.|`|WSUvYalNaa	every buddy is different 13-16 maybe|`|De2k2Aacaa	this just helped me so much cuz im 13.5 wondering the same exact thing|`|9FnawCaoaa	that's a little to young don't get ur hoped up but maybe by 15 or 16 4 sure|`|ZvW8dvt4aa	most likely 13.5 yrs+|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Most guys start to experience puberty between ages 13 and 15.

Then it was found to be even more addictive!
ICHzrALJaa	When you purchase your first box of tampons, it'll have an "instruction booklet" with diagrams. Read the instructions carefully and review the diagrams. <br>  <br>  Once you're ready to insert the tampon the most important key to remember is to relax. It's not painful to insert a tampon, but if you're tense it could make the process a little uncomfortable. Before inserting the tampon, wash your hands with soap and water. There are a few different positions you can use to insert the tampon. Two such positions are either placing one foot on top of the toilet or squatting over the toilet; again you'll have to figure out which technique is best for you. Holding the center of the tampon between your thumb and ring finger and using your index and middle finger to hold the string in place, gently insert the tampon into your vagina. If you feel pain or discomfort, slow down and relax. It may take a while your first time. Once you've inserted the tampon and the center (the part you're holding on to) is at the entrance of your vagina, using your other hand, gently start pushing the exposed end of the tampon. This releases the actual tampon into your body. You know it's fully inserted when the end of the part you're pushing meets the center part you were originally holding.|`|iPL269DLaa	kind of difficult to explain, but i'll try to help...but before i start explaining, usually in the box they will put in directions...<br>  <br>  okay here we go, sorry if it doesn't make sense...<br>  <br>  so i personally like i sit on the toilet and spread my legs apart...then i take the tampon (outta the wrapper obviously) and insert it pretty slow into my vagina at a particular angle...the directions says something like towards your lower back, but i don't think that accurate, it's more so the same angle you take if you insert a finger...then you just simply push it up until your fingers are like right against your skin then push the end where the string is hangin out all the way until it stops where the little ridges are then pull out and it should be in =]<br>  <br>  my first time felt really weird, and i think i had to try twice to get it right...and if you get it in and you start walkin around and you can feel it and it's uncomfortable, take it out and try again because you'll leak if it's not right... hope i helped and i made sense ;]|`|xIBYZzlCaa	It's not hard to learn how to do, just doing it might be a little hard.

Pads feel like diapers and you'll be so glad you learned the right way!<br>  <br>  At first, I think it's easier to do standing up.  The main thing is to relax even though it can seem scary.  With clean hands take the top of the applicator and push it as far into your vagina as you can while still holding the plastic grip part.  While holding the grip with your thumb and middle finger, push on the skinnier part of the applicator that is sticking out of the large part.  This pushes the actual tampon far enough in that it won't fall out and won't be uncomfortable.  When the skinny part is touches the other plastic part, you should be good to go! : )Afterwords, just pull out the other part.  Don't worry! The plastic/cardboard won't get stuck and you can just pull the tampon out by the string if you don't like it.<br>  <br>  You might have to try a couple of times before you get it in right.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  And p.s. it won't hurt and you're not going to damage anything, trust me.

th7D0qzqaa	How to heal pimples:<br>  <br>  1. Wash you skin thoroughly and pat it dry with clean towel.<br>  2. Wrap an ice cube in a washcloth and hold it over the spot for a minute or two; it'll help bring down the swelling.<br>  3. Dip the end of a cotton swab into some diluted tea tree oil (available at any pharmacy, and trust me, this oil was meant for the skin!) and dot a tiny amount directly into the pimple.<br>  4. Leave it alone to heal. Don't pop, pinch, or squeeze pimples, it will only make it worse.<br>  <br>  Also, you can dab a bit of alcohol, lemon juice, toothpaste, or vinegar to pimple before going to bed each night. When you wake up the pimple will be gone. This is because lemon juice, alcohol, toothpaste and vinegar will dry the oil out of pimples.Salt mixed with some water also works. Apply the mixture directly into the pimple. I've also heard that honey removes acne real well too, and it does make your skin totally soft!!!<br>  <br>  This works SOOOO well! I'm not kidding, and you got to try it!<br>  And, tomato juice works too... you cut the tomato into slices and use it like a cleansing pad; rub it around your face and on pimples and pat dry with towel. You can make it into a natural exfoliating pad by sprinkling some sugar on the surface of the tomato slice and rubbing it all on your face.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't have acne, you must do the following skincare routine daily, morning and night to ensure clear and clean skin:<br>  <br>  Make sure you cleanse with a face wash (a very good home cleanser is milk mixed with olive oil), exfoliate with a scrub (or with some sugar mixed with some water), tone with a toner (you can make one by mixing apple cider vinegar with water), and moisturize face with a lotion or cream everyday (you could use olive oil instead of a cream, it is very moisturizing). Steam the face using boiling hot water, apply a face mask (homemade mask: 3 tbsp. plain yogurt, 1 tsp. honey, and a few drops of lemon juice, and mix together), and do a face massage (using olive oil, but its optional) only once, or at most, two times a week. It may seem like a tedious skincare routine, but this facial will really help you avoid blemishes in the future!|`|2hjwUzl8aa	anything with salicylic acid works well
yjWwRMT0aa	When you ejaculate, you are finished.  If you can learn how to orgasm without ejaculating, then you can keep going. The book "Any Man Can" by William Hartman and Marilyn Fithian details the process. Essentially, being able to separate orgasm from ejaculation is necessary for a man to be multi-orgasmic. A male who can do that can have orgasm after orgasm and then only ejaculate when he is ready to stop. When a man ejaculates, he is done with that session of intercourse.<br>  <br>  Only a small fraction of men can be multi-orgasmic.|`|36Ps6EO7aa	A very small amount of men cant do it, some several times.  But it is rare.  YES, if you can stay stimulated, you can pretty much gain an erection and keep going with sexual contact or masturbation.  It may take a little longer the second time.  But to continue doing this again and again is difficult for most men.  I tried it a couple times and was able to come a few times.  But I felt drained and lost the desire for sex for a couple days.  I prefer to PROLONG sexual pleasure as long as possible and save the orgasm for the right moment.
3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Some common causes of memory problems for younger people:<br>  <br>  Not getting enough sleep (need 8 hours, Americans are SO bad at cutting this short!)<br>  <br>  Poor quality sleep - frequent waking (barking dog, planes flying overhead, partner moving around in bed more often because he hurt his shoulder playing football). Or if you are very overweight, or have very large tonsils or adenoids, or some other abnormality breathing, it could be sleep apnea. Maybe the asthma is screwing up your breathing, and you are waking up briefly many times in the night, gasping for air, and don't remember. Especially suspect sleep apnea if you snore, or if you are really tired in the day.<br>  <br>  Doing too much multitasking, and not paying enough attention & therefore, not making a memory to begin with.<br>  <br>  depression or bipolar disorder<br>  <br>  ambien, lunesta, and benzos like ativan, xanax, valium, klonopin<br>  <br>  stressed out (you addressed this)<br>  <br>  Past sexual abuse and you are starting to get therapy for it<br>  <br>  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) a year or two ago - can be awhile before the problems show up.  Could be you hit your head, or maybe lost a lot of blood, so your brain was oxygen deprived.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have memory problems from bipolar disorder and sexual abuse, and what I do is write up lists, and be more organized than other people - anything I have to take with me on a trip, goes right by the front door. Items in the car that need to be dropped off, go on the front passenger seat. I write a list of every place i have to stop, if I am running more than 3 errands. I write down things like "library books due" and TV shows I want to watch, on the calender.  It is still a problem, but the lists and organization really helps.<br>  <br>  There aren't any pills to help memory except Aricept, the alzheimer's drug. Ginkgo was shown not to help.  It doesn't sound like you need ADD drugs, because you used to do fine. I think maybe you have too many things going on at once, or aren't getting enough sleep.  Getting more exercise, at least 1/2 hour most days, can help, too.|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	well i would talk to your Dr , i was having adverse reaction to SOMA muscle relaxer, i was feeling like i had alzheimers i couldn't rememeber what year it was i din't know what happened too 2008?  i was only on muscle relaxer for 1 mo altn days for shoulder injury, my thryoid is goiter so i am on synthroid  you could have thryoid problem i have normal tsh levels but i have the hypothryoid symptoms fibromyalga chronic fatigue symptoms, my VIT d was dangerously low so medical check up is need  do you have high chholestrol?  blood pressure this can cause memeory issues?   i think asthma medication can contribute to memory issues , see a neurologist|`|yVmmDcwFaa	I think you should try Omega3, it really helps memory issues.<br>  <br>  <br>  Check this info:<br>  <br>   "No other natural supplement has been able to aid in concentration like fish oil has.

xnZi0i8saa	There is depersonalization, being detached from yourself, and there is derealization..... being detached from the world, or reality. The thing about psychosis is that you would not know there was a problem. Depersonalization can cause out of body experiences. A combination of derealization and depersonalization probably explains it. The thing about DP/DR is that you feel like you are going insane.... but if you were really going insane you would really not know it. I have struggled with DP/DR for 35 years...... not from smoking pot but from an abusive childhood.  I suggest you quit smoking pot for good, it sounds as though the DP/DR is getting worse the more you smoke. It can take weeks or months to go away... the best thing you can do is just not think about it..... one day you will realize it's gone. But quit smoking pot unless you want to live like this forever!!

8WbfmK5daa	The 'character' you talk about is a coping mechanism which is not a psychology problem and nothing to worry about. At one point most people put on a brave face or become someone they are not in order to get through difficult activities or even just a regular day.<br>  <br>  The anxiety you have mentioned could be generalized anxiety disorder, however.<br>  <br>  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) involves anxiety and worry that is excessive and unrelenting. This high-level anxiety makes normal life difficult and relaxation impossible.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of GAD include<br>  <br>  Your worrying significantly disrupts your job, activities, or social life.<br>  <br>  Your worrying is uncontrollable.<br>  <br>  Your worries are extremely upsetting and stressful.<br>  <br>  You worry about all sorts of things, and tend to expect the worst.<br>  <br>  You’ve been worrying almost every day for at least six months.<br>  <br>  GAD can also present itself through physical symptoms including:<br>  <br>  Muscle tension, aches, or soreness <br>  Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep <br>  Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea<br>  Jumpiness or unsteadiness <br>  Edginess or restlessness <br>  Tiring easily <br>  Irritability <br>  Feelings of dread <br>  Inability to control anxious thoughts<br>   Inability to relax <br>  Difficulty concentrating <br>  Fear of losing control or being rejected <br>  <br>  To Cope with Anxiety, Remember A-W-A-R-E<br>  The key to switching out of an anxiety state is to accept it fully. Remaining in the present and accepting your anxiety cause it to disappear.<br>  <br>  A: Accept the anxiety. Welcome it. Don’t fight it. Replace your rejection, anger, and hatred of it with acceptance. By resisting, you’re prolonging the unpleasantness of it. Instead, flow with it. Don’t make it responsible for how you think, feel, and act.<br>  <br>  W: Watch your anxiety. Look at it without judgment – not good, not bad. Rate it on a 0-to-10 scale and watch it go up and down. Be detached. Remember, you’re not your anxiety. The more you can separate yourself from the experience, the more you can just watch it.<br>  <br>  A: Act with the anxiety. Act as if you aren’t anxious. Function with it. Slow down if you have to, but keep going. Breathe slowly and normally. If you run from the situation your anxiety will go down, but your fear will go up. If you stay, both your anxiety and your fear will go down.<br>  <br>  R: Repeat the steps. Continue to accept your anxiety, watch it, and act with it until it goes down to a comfortable level. And it will. Just keep repeating these three steps: accept, watch, and act with it.<br>  <br>  E: Expect the best. What you fear the most rarely happens. Recognize that a certain amount of anxiety is normal. By expecting future anxiety you’re putting yourself in a good position to accept it when it comes again.<br>  <br>  If self managent does not help you should seek help for a doctor. They will refer you for Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for GAD it involves five components: Education, monitoring, Physical control strategies, Cognitive Control Strategies and behavioural strategies.<br>  <br>  Phobias, such as your one of the number 13 is linked too your aniexty.|`|K9SmiHX6aa	then what u want

5ZmwpI5Qaa	It depends on what you mean by "help".<br>  <br>  A chiropractor cannot "cure" any condition-- at best, they would just make your muscles feel better. It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment, as it will often do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.<br>  <br>  I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care.

Go get checked for breathing difficulties, COPD - from here if diagnosed you will get medicines that will help your breathe better.  You can also access pulmonary rehab where you can learn techniques for getting rid of the mucous.  It is important that the mucous is expelled and does not remain on your lungs as this can cause further lung damage.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid Bronchitis is the result of lung damage which usually cannot be reversed, however there are things you can do to help you cope better with any breathing difficulties you may have.<br>  <br>  My advice - see your doc asap and get tested, especially if you are already having breathing difficulties.  Drinking plenty of water can help keep mucous loose so you can cough it up.

(sounds corny.) Stand up for what you believe in.  If you like something, go for it. If you don't, drop it. It helps finding who you aren't just as well. If it isn't the style, who cares? No one will give a ****. You may find that a lot more people will want to be around you if you are interesting, rather than a wannabe.<br>  This worked for me.<br>  And don't bottle up too much.

I know that you want to give your child the best nutrition as possible but there are things that you can take that won't hurt your son.  You should talk to both of your doctors the Gyn and the psychiatrist who's prescribing the meds.  You should also check with his doctors to see what they think.  Taking care of yourself is paramount so that you can take care of your child. You might also want to ask your Doctor if there is a time when there are only small amounts of drugs in your breast milk if you still continue to breast feed and express your milk at those times to be given by bottle.  But check with your doctors to see if there are things to be given that won't pass through to the breast milk.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	Please be careful because sometimes even doctors disagree about meds you can take.

I have been informed by my trusted gynecologist that I need a hysterectomy and bladder suspension. I am concerned about leaving in my ovaries (he said I should leave them in). I would love someone else's input on this situation.<br>  Age 28 is usually felt to be too young to remove ovaries if there is no disease (there shouldn't be with just prolapse). If a woman didn't take estrogen replacement therapy after a hysterectomy at age 28, she would have an "extra" 23 years of menopausal change with premature aging, earlier heart disease and earlier bone thinning. Lack of estrogen replacement after the menopause at average age 51 reduces a woman's life span by about three years, it is estimated. If you started at age 28, I would suspect life span would be reduced by even more. The answer would seem to be to take estrogen replacement starting immediately after hysterectomy and ovary removal. The problem is that across the board, only about one third of women who intend to take estrogen replacement actually do. Some stop just because it is a pain in the neck to take a daily medicine while others stop because they may have side effects to the estrogen such as headaches, irritability, breast soreness etc. The net result is that there are many women who develop "aging" problems earlier than they need to. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, there are sometimes strong family histories of ovarian cancer, breast and colon cancer that might indicate an increased risk to leaving the ovaries in, which would outweigh the risks of earlier heart disease. Thus, sometimes the decision needs to take into account your family history of medical problems.|`|VXQFT341aa	Yes you can.

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods.

For your abs and obliques, do inclined sit ups w/ a medicine ball 3 sets of 20 a day will do you're abs good, but try to push yourself to do 3 sets of 30 or 40 even, after that lay on the ground and do leg lifts, basically put your hands palm down on your butt to support your back, lift you legs up until they're pointing to the ceiling then lower them, holding them for 5 seconds about 6 inches off the ground, do two sets of 20 of those at night and your abs will be ripped in no time, for your obliques they have a machine if you have access to it, if not try side planks...they're kinda hard to explain over this but if you google it...or yahoo it haha, you should be able to see how it's done.  Good luck man!|`|ZAqTOjs6aa	I used to be the same way. Honestly, just get over it. Thats what I did. No one called me fat, no one said "eww." You know why?

Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|fVhevXeraa	excersise.<br>  eat healthier.<br>  go on weight loss sites.<br>  xD

I guess it's a side effect. Try cardio or ab exercises! Also drinking a lot of water w/o exercising it off can cause a tummy. Just be active throughout the day and it should flatten out.

rR4PtPuUaa	Unfortunately every optometrist, optician, ophthalmologist will tell you that there is no way to get rid of myopia except surgery. Sadly, that isn't true.

I ate a LOT of carrots and many other vegetables.  My eye prescription had been the same for years (throughout my 20s) and then 6 months later it had improved - not significantly but to -2.50 and -2.25.  I asked how that could have just suddenly happened and the optometrist just kind of jokingly said that it could if I had eaten a lot of veggies.  I chuckled and said I had!  Of course this is not scientific but I certainly believe that it happened in my case.<br>  <br>  It won't relieve you from wearing glasses or contacts though.<br>  <br>  I've since had laser eye surgery and have had 20/20 vision or better consistently for 2+ years.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	try natural vision improvement, Bates method and undercorrection.|`|im0OsH78aa	There is no way.<br>  It won't go away.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	It's not too early per say, however you need to make sure you are educated enough to make a decision on whether or not to take the pill - don't base it on what people on Yahoo! Answers say. There are other birth control methods that would be better suited to you, of course condoms if used correctly are highly effective as well as protect you against most STI’s, which is important if having sex outside of a long-term monogamous relationship. The pill is common as it’s popular with doctors as a quick-fix to menstrual problems and as an easy way to prevent unwanted pregnancy without having to put any effort into care or explaining other options. It’s up to you to make an educated decision, however in an ideal world the pill should be a last option given its effects on your body and possible side-effects. <br>  <br>  In younger women like yourself one of the biggest issues against the pill is that the pill will suppress your natural menstrual and hormonal cycles. In preventing your normal cycles it limits how you care for your sexual health, without different natural changes throughout your menstrual cycle you will not be able to tell when you are fertile, which itself can cause problems in trying to avoid pregnancy. You’ll also not be able to tell as easily if you have a vaginal infection, and you could not tell if you were to have any fertility problems as the pill would cover up the symptoms. There are many side-effects to consider, as your hormonal cycles effect your whole body the use of synthetic hormones in the pill and suppressing your normal cycles can also affect your whole body, with a host of different side-effects ranging from weight-gain to strokes. Doctors will often give out the pill without discussing other options, how the pill works, or how to use it correctly, furthermore the pill given is often the cheapest or the most popular brand. If using the right pill for you then you shouldn’t get any side-effects but it can take many years to find the correct type or brand of pill for you, there is no exact science to this as the pill can affect you in any way and doctors are often unwilling to help you find what is best for you. Long and short of it is that you need to do a hell of a lot of research so you know if the pill is right for you, how it works, how to use it, to be able to demand appropriate care from your doctor, know what your other options are, etc.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-pill-4228.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Pills aren't the only option =) the site I gave you is extremely helpful and informative.|`|HHyny0JSaa	No its not too early. As soon as you decide to become sexually active then you should be taking precautions. Not only will being on the pill give you the added protection you will need, but it will also have other benefits like regulating your period. But don't let the pill sway you from using other forms of protection (condoms). You still have to watch out for STD's

Keep in mind that sizing varies from company to company so maybe you might have to play around with the sizes to find the best fit.<br>  <br>  This used to happen to me all the time. I used to think I was a 36 band size but I'm actually a 30 band.|`|ORUAtr0kaa	Try a bigger one on next time, and see if it fits better. That's about the only advice I can give you. Also try adjusting the straps maybe.|`|VQfDXVl5aa	As a Bra Specialist at Victoria's Secret. it sounds to me that the band is too big and bra cup is too small. So let's say you have a 36C on, you want to go up a cup and down a band which would make it a 34D. I do, however, highly recommend you go to a store that offer bra fittings so that you can see if you're wearing the bra size because it might just be a different style you need. At victoriasecret.com, there's a step by step guideline on how to measure your own bust if you don't feel like making a trip to a bra specialist.
ARSnCRLbaa	1) Floss holders.  You wrap the floss around the tip of the prongs.  This way you dont have to wrap floss around your fingers.  They're also re-usable.

8PqsT1l6aa	ok, first of all my greetings begins with Hello.<br>  <br>  yes, eating before going to bed effects on quality of sleep.<br>  <br>  I'll be more specific......... eating before sleeping effects the stomach as well. When you eat it takes at least 4 hours for the stomach (small intestine) to perfectly digest the food and absorb the chemicals, hence this effects on the stomach because it is not easy for it to digest the food and it might cause injuries. <br>  <br>  As for the quality of sleep, it might cause bad dreams. In addition you might not be able to concentrate the next day if you have test.<br>  <br>  Minimum time is 2 hours and 1/2 before sleeping. If you do this, eat and enjoy healthy life! (*_*) <br>  <br>  my greetings end with Bye.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	it does affect how you sleep because if you eat something that gives you gas or gives you heartburn then youre not going to have a very peaceful sleep. but hey just try to eat about 2 to 3 hours before going to bed. snacks should be fine though right before sleeping.<br>  and fyi if you eat and then sleep you gain weight if you dont exercise|`|CAQAmZbjaa	It is a known fact that if you eat spicy foods before you sleep, there is a big chance of getting nightmares.|`|saJoelMwaa	Well i dont no if it affects how u sleep, but i do no its bad for u and u gain alot more weight.|`|nDLTXhugaa	Its actually bad for your body to be processing food while at rest. For one i researched that it causes acne. Also since your at rest the energy (carbohydrates, protein etc) will not be used since your not active, and will be stored as fat!<br>  <br>  Does it affect the quality of sleep? if you dont over-eat then probably not, but if you eat a bit too much before sleeping it causes uneasiness in your digestive tracts. In some cases it may also cause heart-burn and when that happens, say good-bye to deep sleep.|`|Ldra6te8aa	Eating a lot before bed causes un-easy sleep and often nightmares.<br>  You shouldn't have a large meal after a few hours before you go to bed.<br>  Eating junk food like chips and pop aren't the best before bed too.<br>  Your body burns about 60 caleries per hour sleeping, so it also isn't the greatest idea to eat before you go to bed if you're trying to lose weight.|`|UepUqU5daa	Well, they say you are sleepier when you're full...<br>  <br>  <br>  But I find it rather uncomfortable, actually :\<br>  Unless it's Peeps!!! Y A Y!<br>  :]|`|NJFYVNj4aa	it doesnt but u will gain weight like that faster<br>  because u eat then lay down with no exercise as to lunch or dinner<br>  u will still be active after ur meal<br>  <br>  so if u want to avoid gaining any weight<br>  <br>  id stay away from it|`|LXJCQ3SAaa	yes eating less than two hours before bed will give you more energy and you will have a restless sleep|`|K4FVyJuXaa	they say that gives you nightmares b/c of the uneasiness of your stomach|`|qtcAh2rlaa	not really just makes you fatter.|`|tapEUslKaa	I doubt it.|`|DWgyWFNyaa	IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES|`|vpeZTL9Laa	Yeah, I think it makes it worst.  One time I ate like three slices of really good pizza and then tried to go to sleep and I HAD to take a dump before my head hit the pillow!|`|rypsRNs0aa	It really depends, a full meal is not good before going to bed at any age, a little light snack is o.k. As one gets older this gets more important so if you are a young en just be sensible and have a light snack, it's still better than going to bed with an empty stomach, that might wake you up and you wont be able to go back to sleep until you've racked the larder
a085260e18048091431aa093b935186faa	Step 1: Find out what your basal metabolic rate is. Go to: <a href="http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off-permanently.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nowloss.com/how-to-lose-weigh...</a> <br>  Ignore the advertisements there. This is the amount of calories you need to eat to maintain your current weight.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Do you exercise? Do you exercise right? Exercising right means that you monitor your heart rate and make sure that you reach your target heart rate and maintain it for the longest period of time while exercising. You have two targets a fat burn zone and an cardiovascular zone. The fat burn is usually 60% of your maximum and is easier to achieve and maintain and if your goal is weight loss this is where you want to be. Just walking/excising is a good start but if you want to get the most out of your work out find out what your target range is. If you don't belong to a gym then I recommend the Polar Fitness F11 Heart Monitor Watch.<br>  <br>  Step 3: You need to decrease your caloric intake or increase the amount of calories your body uses in a day by 500 calories a day for a week to lose 1 pound. So you can decrease that basal number you got in step 1 by 500 calories and exercise very little(yes you still need to exercise). Or you can decrease it by 250 and exercise off 250 calories or any other combination. Remember that your basal number is the amount of calories you body needs to live. If your number were 2400 then your body burn 100 calories per hour. So if you walk for half an hour and burn 300, 50 of that is your basal.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Count your calories, it's not hard and you'll find out that you eat a lot of the same things on a daily basis so you won't have to research everything over and over again. Balance what you eat (equal parts carbs and protien whenever possible) . One of the best websites out there is one from the FDA. <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/se...</a><br>  This database has almost every food on the planet counted and weighed. (Hint: they do a lot of their weights based on 100grams. If you put 0.28 in the serving size this equals 1 ounce). Get a reliable food scale, preferably digital. Weigh everything that you put in your mouth that is not prepackaged. You need to know what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. The number one mistake is "eating healthy". Everyone thinks because it's "healthy" the portion isn't that important. A handful of peanuts is "healthy" and has nearly 250 calories! Eat enough calories and it won’t matter how "healthy" it is your going to gain weight. Great ideas for people on the go are: South Beach Cinnamon Raisin Cereal Bar(awesome snack, 150 calories, 10g of protein! 3g fiber you can not do better, also comes in Peanut Butter and Chocolate), Snickers Marathon Multi-Grain Crunch(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle), Snickers Marathon Protein Caramel Nut Rush(Wal-Mart diet aid aisle).<br>  <br>  Step 5: Balance! In what you eat. Make sure that you are eating Protein, Carbs, and Fiber in every meal. A great way to make sure you get the protein and fiber is Kelloggs Protein Water. It has only 30 calories but gives you 5g protein and 5g fiber for 20z. Go to Wal-mart they sell a 10 pack of the powder for ~$5.50. That way when you are eating a high carb food for a snack or meal you can still get the balance. <br>  <br>  Step 6: Smaller but more. Each smaller snacks more often instead of big meals. This really does work and will definately increase your metabolism. I eat a South Beach Cereal Bar every 2 hours all day then a good dinner. They keep me full and they taste pretty good. Caffiene is your friend. It is a natural appetite suppressant so have that cup of coffee!<br>  <br>  Step 7: Adjustments and Variety. If you are doing your best and losing weight but your starving, increase the amount of calories your giving yourself by 100-200 calories a day. Losing weight and starving are not good bedfellows. If you starve eventually you will crack and lose the battle. The more types of exercises you do the more weight you will lose. You will work more muscles and keep your body guessing.<br>  <br>  Step 8(optional): If you belong to a gym or have some free weights at home. Use them! Muscle takes up less space in your body than fat (pound for pound). A pound of fat sits around and does nothing all day, while a pound of muscle, even at rest burns calories(increasing your basal metabolic rate).<br>  <br>  Step 9: Sleep, Never underestimate the power of a goodnight sleep. Will power can crumble in a second if your going through your day tired. You end up with a diminished sense of self control and tend to “give in” to temptation.<br>  <br>  Step 10: Find a distraction. Read a book, Ride a bike, Play a game. Whatever takes your mind off of food, do it. You will need something that you can turn to in a moment of weakness. Something that will distract you for a half an hour so that your will can reassert itself and help you to make a rational decision.|`|qYdRH4TXaa	It could be better by adding more vegetables.|`|kAs5o8XDaa	Unless your doctor says you overweight, you don't need to be worrying about loosing weight. It's not healthy, your only 14. Just focus on eating healthy and don't worry about calorie intake too much. Eating 6 small meals a day helps keep your metabolism going and exercising daily too, but make sure your eating enough or it will slow down. <br>  Look up a food pyramid guide to see how much you should be eating of each food group. Your still young and need enough food to grow and be healthy.|`|BYop0QxFaa	Can you eat 100% wheat bread?  The rolls have a lot of calories. You need some C in your diet.  An orange would be great and loaded with potassium, good for the muscles.  As long as you eat some green leafy veggies, you are doing good.    After thought- the rolls are ok as long as you exercise a lot.|`|jPBJmGyRaa	No, it doesn't.  You aren't eating near enough fruits and vegetables.  Aim for five a day.  Chicken casserole is usually very fatty, and contains few nutrients.
ArVCMN3faa	Depends how much you weight now, but its a really really bad idea, because you will gain it all back plus more when you start eating again.

Oz9Uwcuaaa	If you are really anxious about the extraction, then Xanax will help that. It won't do anything for pain. And it might make it really hard to stay awake.<br>  <br>  Unless you have experience taking that high of a dosage, maybe you should break it in half and just take 1 mg. You'll still be tired, but you won't fall asleep with the dentists hands in your mouth.|`|lqnMTAziaa	It depends how your pill tolerance is. basically, having your mouth numbed is enough to get you through. You wont feel a thing. I was given valium before my appt. and is made no difference whatsoever. I guess it might calm you down a little, but the real thing that will make you okay is being numbed. If you are still worried, some nitrous will help you along the way alot more than any xanax will.
zEy0uuAFaa	I'm assuming you're a boy, though your avatar and your screen name could be open to either interpretation.<br>  The opening of your urethra at the end of your penis is called the meatus.  The line your describing could be the raphe line, it runs from the meatus down along the underside of your penis, then across the scrotum between the testicles, then across the perineum to end at the anus.  It marks the point where the two halves of your pubic area grew together and fused when you were still an embryo.  The raphe line is somewhat sensitive, speaking from personal experience.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't match the feature you're describing, you might have an unusual wrinkle or a scar, the latter especially likely if you were circumcised as an infant.  Generally the meatus is supposed to be smooth.  You could show it to a doctor to get an educated opinion, better than anyone here could give you not having seen your penis.  If it is a scar it will probably become less noticeable over time, as you penis grows larger and as skin migrates about over time.|`|dWTcdnPvaa	Lindsay,<br>  <br>  I'm not sure of your gender, but i will assume you are talking about a penis here.....this sounds most like the frenulum. This is a tissue band that stretches from the lower end of the meatus (pee-hole) to the bottom surface of the glans (head) of the penis. It is an incredibly sensitive place. Most circumcised males do not have frenula, so if you are not circumcised, this is natural anatomy. <br>  <br>  It will not grow "normal" or change. Enjoy the sensitivity and don't worry about this.|`|312818be7ceec3a2ffd5edfa19beb2eaaa	Well,Lindsay,you're posting this in 'Men's Health' but ,well,everyone has a urethra.Uh,your avatar looks like a girl so I'm not sure here.I would be concerned in knowing where the 'weird scar' came from.It seems like an unlikely place for a birthmark.Scar tissue could be connected to your clitoris and pulled in a certain way,could be causing the sensitivty.But scar tissue is senitive anyway,so...I would just stay the course for now and later,when you get your next checkup,mention it to the doctor.That's about the best I can do except to say I hope it all works out for you.BK

sHdsIUyWaa	Ive had 3 surgeries to remove cysts from my ovaries. The surgery isnt bad at all. The one I had in Dec, I had surgery @ 8 and was out of the hospital @ 10. Sore afterwards but not too bad, I actually went shopping after I was done. The downside is... The cysts might grow back. With every cycle you will get cysts but they usually go away. I went back to the Dr in Jan and he said I have 2 very large cysts on each ovary now ( the size of grapefruit) but Im not willing to go through another surgery yet.  I know they are painful though. Hopefully they will be gone and you wont have to go through it.
bmoCpcdraa	the best way to shed pounds is to drink no soda ,no diet soda, do not fry any thing .bake fish ,tuna no mayo, bake or boil chicken or turkey, bake enough to last 3 or 4 meals,use extra meat to eat  cold or mix in salad, bake some veggies in same pan to get good flavor,bake extra veggies to re-heat later, make big pot of soup ,with veggies and some chicken and cabbage etc.,make lots of extra so you can re-heat one bowl at a time, drink 6 glasses of water a day ,it is a must,i would carry them small water bottles around with me ,cause you can put the lid on them if they get warm then re-refrigerate ,try not to eat to much bread, try not to eat to late before bed ,eat lots of fruit and veggies, if you have leftovers in frig. you may be  more willing to eat them then a fat snack,get some sliced fat free cheese,you can melt a slice on some veggies to make them taste better, make sure you eat well, it is a healthy choice not a diet,,, hope i helped|`|g4l2VHYGaa	im 16 and in same postion.<br>  <br>  <br>  i tried the weight loss pill slimquick, and they really didnt do much, just made you go to the bathroom more then usual, didnt lose any weight..<br>  <br>  crash diets wont work tried it! just got really hungary and body went in starvation mode and whatever i ate even tho it was only fruit and healthy salads it held on it and stored that way never worked.<br>  <br>  and never heard of contour abs

EpMi1OgLaa	well a good start will be a gym membership and a very good training plan which includes weight training and lots of cardio, also it must have recovery days.  start off by doing about 30 - 45 minutes cardio i.e. aerobic fitness (this can also act as a warm up for the weights), then go into weight training targeting different muscle groups. you should eat about 5 meals a day having the correct amounts of carbs and protein. a good supplement to take would be whey protein straight after the workout when your muscles need the protein the most, also try go for an amino acid called L Glutamine, this helps with muscle recovery

xRQAsGRAaa	NO. Calories come from different parts of foods. Beer is empty calories. They're calories with no nutritional value. Calories come from protein, carbs, fats, and other parts of foods.<br>  The ideal balance of calories for an ACTIVE PERSON is: 40% calories from carbs, 40% calories from protein, and 20% calories from fats. <br>  If you're not very active, cut calories by reducing the calories from carbs.<br>  <br>  Here's, on average, how many calories are in 1 gram of carbs, 1 gram of protein, and 1 gram of fat. It should say it on the bottom of the label of whatever you're eating, but if it doesn't just use this since it will be pretty close.<br>  <br>  4 calories are in 1 gram of protein<br>  4 calories are in 1 gram of carbs<br>  9 calories are in 1 gram of fat<br>  So if you're on a 1300 calorie diet, that means 520 calories should come from carbs, 520 calories should come from protein, and 260 calories should come from fats.|`|oiDwss3kaa	Welllll technically if your recommended intake is 2,000 calories/day and you take in 1,500 cal/day in pizza and burgers, then yes, you would actually lose weight over time. You would not be leading a healthy life though...you wouldnt have any energy, feel bloated all the time and be crabby. If you switch to 1,500 cal of healthy eating, youll lose weight faster and adding exercise on top obviously speeds up the weight loss even faster. <br>  <br>  I would HIGHLY recommend not eating whatever is in front of you and being smart about your food choices.|`|BKbjK19Oaa	Calories or kilo calories (Kcal) as it is really called is just a measurment of how much energy a nutrient is containing. <br>  This means if you eat a total of 1500 kcal by eating pizza and burgers you will recieve the same amount of energy as if you would eat 1500 kcal through chicken and sallad. <br>  Though your body will probally become very low and out of balance if you only eat pizza and burgers.<br>  There are so many better alternatives. Bake your own pizza, although there are better options its way better than going and buying one. tastes better too.|`|NOUL05wUaa	Yes a calorie is a calorie where it comes from a candy bar or an orange. What matters is the Total sum at the end of the day.<br>  that's why there are watermelon, meat, fish, jelly bean you name it.<br>  it's just that total that matters. However, certain foods contain vitamins and minerals your body needs to feel and function well. So I wouldn't recommend going on a candy bar diet.  :)|`|MwvA8v17aa	yuppp! burn more than you eat<br>  as long as you dont feel like you are starving, because then youre metabolism will slow down since its hanging on to the calories you have left.

You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple.

At times there will be a vague, nagging ache in the upper abdomen but usually the pain is not sharp or crampy as might occur with ulcers or a gallbladder attack. There may be vomiting, heartburn, or regurgitation of stomach fluid into the mouth. Medications that reduce or eliminate stomach acid usually don't help much.<br>   <a href="http://gicare.com/Diseases/Gastroparesis.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://gicare.com/Diseases/Gastroparesis...</a>
0Jbkqqrraa	i would do this:<br>  1. take down ever single carb count from the above<br>  2. prepare a healthy food diet for the child and do some research about the carb count.<br>  3. make her see the comparison between the above foods and make her aware of the deficiencies of any single nutrition that she is not taking (which is practically everything except carbs and fats) and what they will eventually lead to. i think it is best to tell her that if she does not take for example vitamin C, her gums would bleed then her teeth would become distorted. try finding out pictures in textbook if you must.<br>  if it is anything else that will make a teenage girl horrified, it is to see herself become ugly. tell her that if she does not eat the body will start to store up the fats and sugars that she ate to become the fats of her body, which is true enough.

They cause the muscles in your uterus to contract...really hard.   <br>  They are produced in your body BEFORE your period.  Once the pain has started, all attempts you make to ease it will be pretty lame.  <br>  <br>  Prevention is the name of the game<br>  You have to reduce prostaglandin production during the month before your period.  I had success with this by taking in more Omega 3 Fatty acids.  I took it in the form of Krill Oil capsules.  I took 3 a day! and I saw results after doing it for one month.  Not everyone does though.  Our diets are very low in omega 3s.  Also, you need to take magnesium.  There are clinical studies backing up both omega 3s and magnesium for period pain.  <br>  <br>  Don't buy krill from cvs or walgreens; they charge 30 bucks for 60 pills.  Costco has 90 pills for $18.  I buy MegaRed brand.  I gave up other stuff to be able to afford it because it works so well on my debilitating pain..as prevention!  <br>  <br>  If you can't get your hands on krill oil, take fish oil!  And ibueprofen also stops prostaglandin production. Take one a day the week before your period.  <br>  <br>  Also, don't go on "the pill" just to help your period.  It's horrible for your body.  <br>  <br>  My doctor has prescribed vicodin for my pain, but it doesn't do anything besides make me loopy and it still hurts.|`|Hwlzaulpaa	1. Sex.

Well first off I think that kids hold parents to a Higher standard than they hold most people to. I have never met your mom or you and I wasn't there when all of this happened so I can't give a very good opinion. I haven't heard anything from her point of View. But I can give you one very valuable piece of advice. Think about this do you love your mom? Imagine she died tomorrow? Would you miss her and all the stupid things she did? Of course she has her flaws and so do you but you have to accept her flaws and all. I used to fight with my mom a lot. I am so opinionated. But deep down I loved her no matter what and I figured one day I could apologize for the stupid fights. She died and its been almost a year now and I would love a time machine. Seriously consider this. You think your depressed now imagine your life without her. I know there are bad parents that just don't care. I know how it feels to be ignored by your parents. But maybe we over react when we are depressed. Maybe you should get professional help because at least then you won't have to worry about trusting someone that could turn around and stab you in the back or make you feel misunderstood. Good luck.|`|qpkXD4RCaa	Hmmm... What a dilemma, i'm guessing you were pretty upset when wrote this.  I "could" say you should talk to a guidance councilor at school or you should talk to your mom about alcohol and how you feel but here's the thing:  I'm guessing you come from a lower middle class household, your mom works alot of hours and your mom's somewhat depressed. So to rid herself of that depression she covers it up with alcohol, and now shes getting mad at you for not giving her enough pity.  What I would do is live through it, try your best to get good grades, go to college, get a good job and live your life.  Just because your mom is depressed doesn't mean you have to be.  Your other option is to as I originally said, talk to your guidance councilor or get her off alcohol.  Then again, you can also talk to child services and be put in a foster home but...  I wouldn't do that. Don't distance yourself from other people, thats never a good idea.  Friends are a good thing to have when your going through tough times.  I hope this helps

Oa3jZFLIaa	Don't starve yourself or throw up. These are two of the worst things you can do to your body. Calm down. There are many things you can do to lose weight. First of all, eat smaller portions. Eat healthy foods. A diet rich in fruit and vegetables as well as vitamins, minerals, and nutrients is needed. Also, exercising for 10 minutes at a time is a good idea. Go for a walk in your neighborhood after dinner, do yard work, or join a gym. On Discovery Health, I saw a 16 year old boy who was 4 hundred something pounds. He lost his weight by having a type of surgery that cuts the stomach off and joins the small intestine to where the stomach would normally be joined. The smaller space for food to be stored helped the boy lose over 2 hundred pounds, but this surgery is only considered as a last resort. Another good idea is to think of the health risks of being overweight. Diabetes, high cholesterol, varicose veins, and other health risks can be associated with being overweight. As you slowly start to lose weight, these health risks will go away. I lost weight by eating at home. I didn't go to restaurants and ate healthy meals. I also stayed away  from soda and junk food, and once the taste was out of my mouth, I didn't crave it so much.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and good luck! :)|`|AA10010715	Visit your doctor and ask him/her to recommend a dietician.

I also started eating at home more.  Sure I want that pizza and big Mac but if I eat something at home first then I'm not so tempted! But I go with my friends and at about 1/2 of one rther than the whole thing.  I eat ice cream but I buy it in serving sizes like drumsticks.  One is really all you need.  I didn't really like to eat my veggies but I started slowly.  I also eat alot more fruit that way too.  When I go to a restarunt we ysyally hare a dinner but order a side salad or patotoe, whatever would come with it.  Jus eating smaller portions and aving money!

cilYUWgtaa	Not sleeping enough and not sleeping well is not OK. As a matter of fact, there is quite a price to pay. It may surprise you to learn that chronic sleep deprivation, for whatever reason, significantly affects your health, performance, safety, and pocketbook.<br>  <br>  There are many causes of sleep deprivation. The stresses of daily life may intrude upon our ability to sleep well, or perhaps we trade sleep for more work or play. We may have medical or mental-health conditions that disrupt our sleep, and be well aware that we are sleep-deprived.<br>  <br>  However, it is critically important to realize that sleep deprivation is very often due to unrecognized sleep disorders. After a typical night's sleep, you may not feel restored and refreshed and be sleepy during the day, but be totally unaware that you are sleep-deprived or have a sleep disorder. You might think, "It's just the stress of work or the kids," or you might have "always felt this way" and had no idea that you should feel differently. This lack of awareness compounds the consequences, because so many people remain undiagnosed for years.<br>  <br>  That said, let's look at the consequences of sleep deprivation.<br>  <br>  In the short term:<br>  <br>      * Decreased Performance and Alertness: Sleep deprivation induces significant reductions in performance and alertness. Reducing your nighttime sleep by as little as one and a half hours for just one night could result in a reduction of daytime alertness by as much as 32%.<br>      * Memory and Cognitive Impairment: Decreased alertness and excessive daytime sleepiness impair your memory and your cognitive ability -- your ability to think and process information.<br>      * Stress Relationships: Disruption of a bed partner's sleep due to a sleep disorder may cause significant problems for the relationship (for example, separate bedrooms, conflicts, moodiness, etc.).<br>      * Poor Quality of Life: You might, for example, be unable to participate in certain activities that require sustained attention, like going to the movies, seeing your child in a school play, or watching a favorite TV show.<br>      * Occupational Injury: Excessive sleepiness also contributes to a greater than twofold higher risk of sustaining an occupational injury.<br>      * Automobile Injury: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates conservatively that each year drowsy driving is responsible for at least 100,000 automobile crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities.<br>  <br>  The good news for many of the disorders that cause sleep deprivation is that after risk assessment, education, and treatment, memory and cognitive deficits improve and the number of injuries decreases.<br>  <br>  In the long term, the clinical consequences of untreated sleep disorders are large indeed. They are associated with numerous, serious medical illnesses, including:<br>  <br>      * High blood pressure<br>      * Heart attack<br>      * Heart failure<br>      * Stroke<br>      * Obesity<br>      * Psychiatric problems, including depression and other mood disorders<br>      * Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)<br>      * Mental impairment<br>      * Fetal and childhood growth retardation<br>      * Injury from accidents<br>      * Disruption of bed partner's sleep quality<br>      * Poor quality of life<br>  <br>  Studies show an increased mortality risk for those reporting less than either six or seven hours per night. One study found that reduced sleep time is a greater mortality risk than smoking, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Sleep disturbance is also one of the leading predictors of institutionalization in the elderly, and severe insomnia triples the mortality risk in elderly men.<br>  <br>  Remarkably, sleep loss may also be a contributing factor to obesity. John Winkelman, MD, PhD, medical director of the Sleep Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School sums up this finding up nicely: "What most people do not realize is that better sleep habits may be instrumental to the success of any weight management plan." And Michael Thorpy, MD, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York adds, "Any American making a resolution to lose weight ... should probably consider a parallel commitment for getting more sleep."<br>  <br>  It is also important to realize the huge scope and prevalence of these disorders; more than 85 sleep disorders are recognized by the American Sleep Disorders Association, affecting more than 70 million Americans. Up to one-third of Americans have symptoms of insomnia; however, less than 10% of those are identified by primary-care doctors. Sleep-related breathing disorders represent a spectrum of abnormalities that range from simple snoring to sleep apnea (repeated episodes of cessation of breathing during sleep). As highly prevalent as they are, most cases remain undiagnosed and untreated.<br>  <br>      * Chronic snoring, for example, is associated with an increased incidence of heart and brain-related diseases. It is present in about

deYDbVDSaa	Most of these crash diets have extremely low calorie counts (under 1000 calories). Since people eat so little, their bodies reset the amount of calories they use. This is known as starvation mode, or low metabolism. For example: if someone normally burns 2200 calories a day, then the body will reset to only burn 1500 calories per day. So, when they stop the diet, all of a sudden the body has a ton of extra calories floating around, which it will store as fat.<br>  <br>  As an added bonus, when most people break these diets they tend to have a huge appetite and really overeat for the first few days. Thus, they are overeating with a low metabolism, what better way to put on fat?

The main point is that when you are on a diet, you are supposed burn more calories than what you take in. However, your metabolism adjusts to the amount of calories you consume. When this happens your metabolism slows down and that's when you stop losing weight. Fat Loss 4 Idiots asserts that the answer to this problem is calorie shifting.<br>  <br>  By rotating your protein and carbs intake everyday, your body's metabolism increases and this, according to Fat Loss for Idiots, will help you lose weight faster. With a combination of perfect carb and protein, you are allowed to eat four times a day with this diet. This process corrects and regulates your fat burning hormones, thereby helping you quickly and safely lose weight. This ingenious technique is known as the calorie shifting method.<br>  <br>  Weight loss for idiots is where I first started looking for an easy way to lose weight because I became a fat body. My search lead me to Fat loss 4 idiots, which as it turned out was perfect for me. Fat loss for idiots claims you can lose more weight by eating more often. It can also be done in a very simple step by step process.<br>  <br>  The results of weight loss 4 idiots is so tremendous that I lost 7 lbs in just 11 days, the promise was I would lose 9 lbs but the 7 in 11 days result is a huge start. After another 11 day cycle, I lost 6 lbs more. So in 22 days, I lost 13 pounds, which may not be the accurate amount of weight I should have lost in their advertisement, but that's 13 pounds!<br>  <br>  Where most diet plans fail is the fact they dont understand how the metabolism works. Fat Loss 4 Idiots uses basic metabolism facts to develop a solution to the diet problem. You see your metabolism has a memory, but it doesn't know how much food you'll eat tomorrow or the next day. Logically, your metabolism only burns calories based on the meals you've had in the past. Weight Loss for Idiots uses this mechanism to come up with the effective diet plan known as calorie shifting method.<br>  <br>  Weight Loss 4 Idiots shocks your metabolism by doing something you've never tried before. With Weight Loss 4 Idiots, you don't eat the same meals with the same calorie content for a couple of days. Through this, your metabolism no longer has a pattern to follow so it forced to burn more calories efficiently.<br>  <br>  Check out my source link, it might help. Good luck!|`|jQCy5x9Iaa	Hey dear,<br>  there's an article i read and it helped me very much, it was talking about meal plans and how to use the calorie shifting technique to achieve your ideal weight, this web based program it's all about how to get you to lose 9 lbs. every 11 days in a healthy matter.<br>  anyway you can see for yourself here is the link to this article <a href="http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/fat-loss-for-idiots-online-diet-system-secret-tips/" rel="nofollow">http://overweightdoc.wordpress.com/2009/...</a> hope it helps
OgJPjFHKaa	I have had the same problem off and on since I was about 14 or so (I'm 25 now), and about 4 years ago they finally diagnosed me as having PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome).<br>  <br>  What that means is that I do not ovulate every cycle, in fact it is very rare that I do ovulate - that is called an "anovular cycle", which causes me to sometimes go months without having a period at all (the longest was almost 10 months), followed by a very long shedding cycle (the longest was almost 5 months) due to the build up of menses. <br>  <br>  Sometimes I will have a perfectly normal, 28 - 32 days long cycle for a few months, and then all of a sudden will have abnormal bleeding for weeks, or sometimes I will have no bleeding at all for weeks.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that when the egg "ripens" in my ovaries, it does not always burst out into the fallopian tubes, sometimes it just forms a cyst instead. This throws my hormones all out of whack, causing a confusion of my endocrine system, which screws up my menstrual cycle. The cysts are diagnosed with an ultrasound. <br>  <br>  The only treatment that helped regulate me was hormonal Birth Control pills, but I am currently looking at another treatment using a drug called Metformin.<br>  <br>  Try Googling "PCOS" and see if you have any other symptoms, and then talk to your doctor about it...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Best of luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|8Bl8XQh8aa	And you're 18?<br>  <br>  You will have to see a gynecologist, a regular doctor will just send you to one.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I recommend going to a gynecologist.

Jtt6SaVIaa	Get an evaluation from the Gastroenterologist and have their people apply for a pre-cert for the surgery. That will give you a conclusive answer.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Which medical card?  Insurance companies usually issue an ID card to members to take to the doctor to prove they have insurance, and so the doctor's office can file the claims in the patient's stead.  <br>  <br>  I would advise you to look at your insurance policy to see if it is covered.  Generally, weight loss surgery is either not covered or requires you to be 100 lbs or more overweight (morbidly obese), and a doctor has to sign off that it is medically necessary.  They don't normally grant it unless you already have some other condition that can be helped or reversed by the procedure such as Type 2 diabetes.

dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|M6y69Y6gaa	Well discharge is normal, in every single woman.<br>  And an odour is normal too as long as its not strong.<br>  <br>  Your vagina has its own cleaning pattern which it does all the time.<br>  You shouldn't wash inside your vagina as you could dry up the natural oils and cause yourself to get an infection like thrush and so on.<br>  Wiping after you pee is enough cleaning inside so leave it alone when you go in the bath or the shower.<br>  Cleaning your groin is fine though.<br>  <br>  Also wearing tight underwear and tight pants can cause excess sweat to build up which could be causing the smell.<br>  If you just let your vagina clean itself then you should be fine :)|`|GTBl5IrYaa	The discharge is actually the bodys way of cleaning itself, so if theres a little its perfecty normal. But usually the main cause of accessive amounts is using certain soaps or sprays down below, or maybe washing too much, as it interferes with the body's natural cycle. I highly doub it is an infection after 3 yrs, dw|`|h3NJO9dWaa	It's totally normal and means you are healthy. It is gross, I hate it but it happens. You can get personal cleansing wipes next to the tampons and stuff, and some fresh sprays or scented pantyliners, but other than that there is not much you can do. <br>  If you feel it's not normal, it could be a yeast infection so call a doc. And don't douche to clean it because that puts bacteria in and will cause infections

RgEtKVaKaa	I am a psychiatric nurse - but, not knowing you, your medical history, your current symptoms, etc.,it would be very difficult to provide you with specific information.  I will address your question in general terms only.  Celexa is often the first drug of choice because there are (usually) fewer side effects.  Please keep in mind that side effects range from manageable to life threatening.  Often a side effect will subside with time.  I tell my patients to contact me if anything unpleasant occurs.  Frequently, I can tweak a few things such as when the med is taken; with food or on an empty stomach, etc.  It is very important that you maintain contact with your prescriber if you experience any unpleasant symptoms or serious events.  Celxa is generic so the cost is substantially less than Effexor.  Effexor was supposed to go generic some time ago however, the manufacturer is dragging it out as long as possible - using all legal means available.  As you may know, treating depression is difficult.  It may take anywhere from 1 to 4 weeks before you realize any benefit from a medication.  Short term counseling/psychotherapy may be a consideration for you.  Celexa may or may not relieve your anxiety.  Effexor does a better job (usually) of relieving anxiety & depression - for most people.  This is not to say that one will work better for you than the other.  Treating depression/anxiety can be frustrating.  An antidepressant is not like an antibiotic.  Sometimes it takes several attempts to find just the right medication.  Sometimes it doesn't.  I hope that is the case for you.  Good luck.<br>  ***I just read the response from others.  A good point - do not abruptly stop an antidepressant.  Weaning is necessary in most, but not all cases. If you do not get relief & your prescriber has tried many different meds & combinations,I strongly suggest you see a psychiatrist.  I use the anaology- if you break your leg, you don't go to an OB/GYN - if you are depressed & anxious, see a specialist.  Also, therapy is very helpful.  Exercise is a key component in treatment, too.  Help is available, unfortunately it sometimes takes a long time to find the right help.  Do not give up.  You can feel well again.|`|25YGiBhZaa	I have severe clinical depression and have never found relief with SSRIs. Years of different kinds and different dosages gave me nothing but awful side effects. It has been proven that SSRIs perform no better than a placebo and that exercise is more effective. Of course it is hard to exercise when you're in the midst of a terrible depression but it does work. Sometimes I have to force myself but it's worth it and I have to do everything I can to combat the awful illness of depression. I also take St. John's Wort. It really takes the edge off without the bad side effects. A good diet, supplementation with vitamin B and omega oils also helps. <br>  It would be wonderful if SSRIs were the miraculous happy pills we are led to believe they are. They are handed out like candy without regard to the problems they can cause. I would love it if they worked. <br>  Depression is a hard illness to fight and I wish you well whatever road you take.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	im on lexapro, which is supposed to be similar to celexa. for me i had dry mouth at first, and maybe slight wieght gain, but not enough that i can tell it was the meds, and not just my bad eating habits. for me it has greatly helped. alot of ppl say it makes you numb, but i think that if you are on the right med for you, you will start to feel normal again. i dont feel numb, i feel pretty good. and i wouldnt listen to ppl that say try this one, or dont try this one, because what works for someone might not work for someone else. you have to try them for yourself. they take time to work (usually about four weeks) and side affects usually dissappear after that so dont give up on a med too soon, and also never stop taking one with out talking to your doc, because you can make yourself sick if not weened off of them properly. good luck.

bNwSwcy0aa	i think you need to wear shoes!!! i dont think it hurts the environment in neway.. but if u dont wear shoes it might end up hurting you!!!|`|NRfs81Raaa	The only way it hurts the environment is in the production of the plastic/rubber that goes into shoes. It is a petroleum product that requires the extraction of oil and the burning of that oil to produce rubbers/plastics.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, actually wearing them does nothing to harm the environment.
duZeLslxaa	Exercise and eating healthy isn't as hard as everyone makes it out to be.<br>  It's not easy by no means, but most of it is just common sense.<br>  <br>  Eat when your hungry and stop when your full, <br>  and exercise daily.<br>  <br>  You have to burn the same number of calories you take in.<br>  Don't starve yourself.<br>  That's the biggest mistake people make..<br>  <br>  Eating wise, eat five well proportioned meals daily.<br>  <br>  For breakfast eat a something like a fruit, and a yogurt.<br>  <br>  or have some oatmeal.<br>  <br>  Both meals are good for you and will hold you over until lunch.<br>  <br>  If you get hungry inbetween breakfast and lunch drink a bottled water. Water is filling, and that's always a good way to break the hunger.<br>  <br>  Lunch time rolls around and you don't have to suffer by eating a salad.<br>  <br>  Eat some baked chicken on a whole grain bun. Make yourself a chicken sandwich. It's good with a light mayo and some tomatoes.<br>  With your sandwich have a fruit, and some baked chips.<br>  <br>  After lunch you can have a small snack.<br>  For example a piece of fruit, a yogurt, or a nutrigrain bar would be a good choice.<br>  <br>  Dinner time rolls around, and again don't suffer by making yourself eat a salad.<br>  <br>  Some good meats to have are chicken, salmon, tuna, and tilapia.<br>  Just make sure it's grilled or baked.<br>  Never friend or breaded.<br>  <br>  With one of those meats have some steamed vegetables, some brown rice, and a roll.<br>  <br>  If you don't like those sides try a corn on the cobb, some angel hair pasta. Get the whole grain pasta if you can..<br>  <br>  After dinner you can have a snack.<br>  <br>  Try and make it something light..<br>  Some veggies, fruit, baked chips, peanut butter toast, nutrigrain bar, yogurt, a small bowl of healthy cereal..<br>  <br>  For exercise just be sure to do at least thirty minutes a day.<br>  <br>  If you eat right and exercise you can lose the weight..|`|W5eCmzQlaa	For exercise, you should do at least 30 minutes 3 times a weeks. To lose weight, you may want to increase that to 5 or 6 days a week. And it needs to be somewhat intense cardio, such as biking, speed walking or running. As for eating healthy, sometimes that isn't enough. You need to make sure you are eating the right amounts at the right times. Breakfast really is an important meal, as it kick starts your metabolism for the day. Throughout the day, eat small meals whenever you are hungry, such as a granola bar, fruit, or veggies.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	This book can give you some pretty basic, yet good information: <a href="http://www.dietspy.com/simple-weight-loss-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietspy.com/simple-weight-los...</a>|`|Vi2CCYTRaa	Try drinking a small can of v8 when you get hungry, its packed with vegetables and even though its disgusting at first its really good for you. <br>  <br>  When it comes to exercising i make sure not to eat before and to drink lots of water whenever i can to avoid needing to have a little snack.

AA12335331	I am the same way and I am now 66.  THere are a lot of men that are born that way.  YOu may want to see a specialist now that you are 14 so that they can search for the location of that testicle that is still in your abdominal cavity.  If they find it they will either bring it down into the scrotum or if it can't be lowered they will remove it so that it does not become cancerous later in life.  No reason to feel weird.  You are still a man in every way with just one, you still have all the urges and feelings, and your penis will get erect and function, and you can get a girl pregnant.  Most girls do not see so many boys genitals that they take time to compare.  Go ahead and let her play with you if are getting into petting and presex stuff.  Take time to show her how you like to masturbate and teach her how to handle your penis gently.  She may comment about your one testicle but just say something like, "Yea all the other guys need two to keep up with me."  Also, take time to learn about how your girl likes to be handled so that you are not to rough on her vagina and clitoris.  Let her take time to instruct you.  Communication is the important thing in beginning sex.  Now for the undescended testicle situation.  You need to see your doctor and talk about that and inform him that when you mature around 18 or so you would like to have an artificial testicle inserted into your scrotum.  It will look and feel like your other one and no one can tell it is fake.  Also, when your girl friend begins to play with you be sure you can trust her and ask her not to go telling all the world about you having one ball.  You have had to take 14 years of guys trying to be funny and you do not want to put up with more smart alecs.  If you have other concerns about this you may communicate with me via the answer email line.  Good luck and enjoy  safe sex.|`|H2IqzG12aa	Of course, there is no reason why the girlfriend of someone your age would need to know how many testicles you have, is there?  If you insist on playing the game, then all the consequences go with it.  You can survive (and get her pregnant) with just one testicle.  So try doing less for the foreseeable future, OK?|`|SltEwVX7aa	sure it all works right.  you just have one testicle.  no big deal.
JwecpnBVaa	Its okay to give in to your cravings, and the fact the sodium (salt) is bad for you isn't really a fact anymore, it has benefits and faults, just like anything you eat.  Just be sure the rest of the things you are eating are really healthy and that you exercise.  Try putting sunflower seeds on a salad or something.  Cut back a little, but not all the way!|`|of049X1waa	are you getting enough water?  Salt helps you retain water, so people who are constantly dehydrated sometimes need more salt, so that they can retain the water longer.

I found that i firstly wasnt eating enough and also drinking too much water-( a large glass every 30mins to -1 hour). <br>  <br>  The thing about salt being unhealthy is that everyone needs a different amount so the guidline 6g(?) isnt always an accurate way to go- i have LOW blood pressure so it is not likely to cause problems for me...

Follow this advice and you will lose weight.<br>  <br>  1.Drink at least 16oz of cold water as soon as you wake up each morning, and try to drink a gallon of water each day.<br>  2. Do cardio in the morning before eating breakfast. Try to do at least 15-20 minutes of high intensity interval training (HIIT training) - look that one up on the net for details. Do cardio up to 5 times per week.<br>  3. Weight train - 30-40 minutes/ 3 days per week. Do total body workout with compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc. There are lots of good books out there on this<br>  4. Don't eat any carbs, sugar or alcohol for a month. Eat only protein, healthy fats and veggies (except carrots and corn because they have lots of sugar).<br>  5. Take CLA -conjugated linoleic acid<br>  <br>  All this stuff helps you boost your metabolism.<br>  <br>  I lost an inch in my gut in a month and I wasn't overweight at all. You may have a dramatic change if you are more overweight. Plus, going carb free will give u lots of energy because your body will be using fat as its fuel rather than incoming carbs. Fat is a very good fuel source.<br>  <br>  For the definitive source for the nutrition and exercise part, and a must read if you are serious about getting healthy and losing weight is The Men's Health TNT Diet<br>  <br>  Check w/ your doctor before doing any of this<br>  <br>  Get the book from the library or go buy it...it's worth every penny|`|gxiKIQIiaa	To tell you the truth everything works better for other people listen to everyones answer and see what works best cause everyone is diffrent!<br>  Bowflex is for me though!

g8pRhElsaa	that's why we have periods - to flush out unfertilized eggs.|`|Zgdxavnmaa	Its flushed out at some point during your period as the egg clamps onto the lining of the womb each month and that lining is what you lose in your blood. I'm not sure when though. The whole idea of losing the egg is so your body can produce a fresher one so it is more likely to be fertilised.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly.

IKakoOfyaa	I think your doctor is wise to send you for assessment as psychological counseling is a very important part of getting healthy.<br>  <br>  A psychologist studies and works with the mind and how it affects our behavior.  Your psychologist will probably have reviewed your medical records in advance of your appointment and during your visit will talk with you about what is going on in your life and how you're reacting to it.  He or she is trained in recognizing clues in your demeanor and in your answers and will use that information in an effort to work with your doctor in diagnosis.  <br>  <br>  It's not at all unusual to have some difficulty communicating at first, but the psychologist is also trained in therapeutic conversation and that will help put you at ease.  What is paramount in importance is that you are honest in your answers and statements.  That helps the psychologist help you in a more appropriate and timely manner.|`|fofzdoROaa	The work of psychology is in questioning and guiding you about what you should do. This expert does not prescribe medicine, which you might need later, but first your health apparently needs to be evaluated.|`|soJwuVdnaa	They will most likely begin the session by asking you why you are there. At that point, you'll be encouraged to talk about your issues with depression.  Depending on the type of psychologist you are seeing (what theories they tend to operate from) they may ask you questions about your childhood, family, job, relationships, among other things. It's important to seek a therapist that is a good match for you and makes you feel comfortable.  If you have a bad experience with the first psychologist you see, don't give up.  There are many counselors who are able to assess depression and treatment.  Including those in the areas of social work and counseling, not just psychologists or psychiatrists.|`|hWujg8zAaa	They work with people who have life adjustment problems, and also with those who have emotional disorders or mental illness. They provide treatment for people of all ages and to families and to groups. Psychologists provide treatment for depression, anxiety, phobias, panic disorders, eating disorders, stress related problems, relationship problems, and severe mental disorders. <br>  <br>  Just because they treat all these things doesn't mean that you have anything severe. I've been depressed before and communication problems. Don't worry it's nothing you can't fix with or without a psychologist.|`|Y0DugutZaa	hi its not something to fear, they will probably ask you various questions about how u sleep, eat, if you are able to concentrate, stay motivated, (often they will give u a questionaire for these questions which u can just tick those which apply to you, so very easy) also they mmight ask about background and lifestyle to be able to see if anything there is a possible cause. psychologists generally just ask questions , get you to talk and air your emotions, they will give tips and advice and usually they let u talk yourself into realizing what it is u need to do or what is a problem.<br>  <br>  but as its an assessment will probably just be very simple, to figure out if u really have dpression and whether it is just plain chemical or whether u will need counselling too. dont worry isnt something to get worreid about.|`|ZyQbfhYRaa	They will just ask you all kinds of questions about your depression and also your life in general.

If this occurs in the week before you are due to have your 7 day break, it is recommended that you skip your 7 day break and start the next pack of pills' immediately. <br>  <br>  If you skipped a pill and are worried about being at risk from pregnancy or you ever miss more than 2 pills, you need to use additional contraceptive for a full 7 days before contraceptive cover is resumed.<br>  <br>  If you want to defer a period, this is fine to do every now and again- do not make a habit of this. To defer a period, instead of having your 7 day break, you skip it and start the next pack of pills immediately. You then have your 7 day break at the end of your second pack of pills. So instead of taking 21 pills then having your 7 day break, you take 42 pills and then have your 7 day break.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	If you have been taking the pills on time every day, missing one will not leave you unprotected.  If you miss two you should use backup protection, throw the pack away and start over after your next period.  As to delaying it, follow the doctors advice or the instructions.  My best friend just takes hers all the time skipping the placebo week and letting herself have a period about every three months to clear things out.  It works well for her.  By the way, it's a common misconception that you're unprotected during the placebo week.  You are not.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	You need to stop using these products.  Clinique contains protein fragments and sugar compounds that "help skin regenerate."  You are having an allergy to the protein, or other, component of the products.  Continued use will make this worse and more wide-spread.<br>  <br>  Try another brand of products.  Sometimes, they use proteins from different sources so you may not have an allergy to a different brand.  Apply some Hydrocortizone cream to the area as indicated on the tube.  An antihistamine can help mellow symptoms in the short term.<br>  <br>  Go back to the store where you bought them (not the counter), talk to the manager, tell them you had a serious reaction to the products, you would like a refund good for purchase of a different brand of beauty products at their store.  Beauty consultants aren't generally educated in immunology.  So, they are not likely to be of any help.<br>  <br>  This concern is real.  You need to wait until your skin heals (with the steroid cream) and then try a different brand.  First apply a small amount on a non-conspicuous part of your skin... not your face.  If you don't have a reaction, then try it on your face.  That is not guarantee that the more sensitive and thin skin of the face won't react, but at least you can quickly weed out the ones that react badly.|`|Qay55Ge7aa	I'm having a similar experience!  I  bought the 3 step intro kit a few months ago, and I had also gotten a new job that involved calling ppl for surveys, so when my skin broke out in itchy little bumps, I thought it was the phone and the mics at work and starting take little wet wipes with me to work.  I then left my products at a friends house and, and skin cleared up, I just used drugstore facial cleanser, can't remember the names but it has these red beads that break open and "wakes you up" .  I used dollar store astringent for toner, the only thing i had in the house, and my skin cleared up...still though I thought it was work that had caused my rash.  When I  finally got my clinique products back and started using it again..I then learned itchfully that it is the clinque thats causing it.  My skin type is "3" as well.<br>  Funny, I thought clinique was a trusted brand and I assumed that I would get what I paid for...<br>  And the cheap cleanser worked much better...|`|e8vggLuFaa	Stop using the products, if you think they are the culprit.<br>  <br>  Before you return them, be sure to keep a diary of what happened and any other reactions you have.  Note down the ingredients so that you can compare with other products that give you problems.  Use products with fewer ingredients and go for natural replacements where possible - i.e. start with petroleum jelly or Aquaphor (if you can do lanolin) as a moisturizer.<br>  <br>  For eczema or very dry skin - after warm shower or warm face washing, use safe oil (i.e. baby oil, or any oil that doesn't give you trouble) while your body/face is still wet.  Towel dry after the oil goes on.  (yes, your towel will have to be washed sooner)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	return the products for a refund and see your dermatologist.

Do you think allergies are limited to certain body parts?  Absolutely not.  You are allerging to anything other than gold, so the only way your body will keep the belly button ring in is if you get a gold one.  You may have difficult though, because if you do it again it'll be the fourth time and the skin will be EXTREMELY thin, so it might just be pushed out anyway because the skin is no longer strong enough to hold it in.<br>  <br>  You should have been smarter about your piercing.|`|pFs71HsHaa	Do you mean your belly button?

R3Xh3NN7aa	This is basically what you do to calculate your proper calorie intake:<br>  <br>  Measure your height in cm. For example, 161 cm<br>  Measure your weight in kg. For example, 58.793 kg<br>  <br>  65+(10 x 58.793 kg)= 652.93<br>  <br>  652.93 + (1.8 x 161 cm)= 942.73<br>  <br>  942.73 - (4.7 x [your age])= 881.63<br>  <br>  881.63 is my BMR. BMR is the amount of calories minimum that I need to survive. Now you have to calculate the activity factor, or how much you excersise. <br>  <br>  If you are moderately inactive (normal, everyday activities) you do this: BMR x 1.3<br>  <br>  moderately active (exercise 3-4 times a week): BMR x 1.4<br>  <br>  very active (exercise 4-6 times a week): BMR x 1.6<br>  <br>  extremely active (exercise 6-7 times a week): BMR x 1.8<br>  <br>  I would multiply my BMR by 1.8 to get 1586.934 calories per day.<br>  <br>  In order to maintain a healthy weight, you have to do all of the multiplications and then the end product is how many calories you should eat.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|rtV052yxaa	i dont know|`|EN5AIqYeaa	Girls - 1500 calories<br>  Boys - 1800 calories<br>  if you don't get the calories you need in your body then you won't have much energy for the day!

AA11168446	There are plenty of fitness programs available on video.  You can find these on TV infomercials all the time.  Things like the Firm, or P90x or Turbo Jam come to mind.  They all give you ability to work out in provacy and comfort of your own home.

SZgOodf1aa	You don't necessarily have asthma based on your description, but whether you have it or not can only be determined by a physician.  You said in your question that you were "...new to running..."  It almost sounds like you tried to do too much too fast in terms of beginning your running program.  If you have been sedentary (that is, you have not been involved in a regular exercise program) and you suddenly try to push your body into strenuous physical exercise, your body will basically "protest" being placed under this stress all of a sudden.  The sorts of symptoms that you listed are certainly possible with such overexertion.  Now, having said that, I am not saying that you DON'T have asthma.  Asthma has to be diagnosed by a physician following a careful medical history and physical examination.  It is possible for a person to have asthma that is brought on or worsened by exercise.  The good news is that it is often very treatable with various medications.  So, first, if you are brand new to exercising I'd recommend slowing down and working into the program slowly.  Start out by walking, then work up to walking with some slow jogging, then up to slow running, etc.   This needs to be done over a period of weeks.  You can't go from sedentary to marathon running overnight.  Also, with the symptoms that you have it wouldn't hurt to contact your doctor and let him/her know about what happened.  They can further advise you on an acceptable exercise program, and they may decide to examine/test you for asthma.  Hope that made sense...|`|JEGArv0Gaa	You should visit the doctor and have a oxymetri test to see, is always ways to find out if your just OK and not running correctly.

It could be something serious.|`|SZgOodf1aa	Ok, I'm a paramedic and 2nd year nursing student.  There's a saying in my line of work, and that is that chest pain is of cardiac origin until proven otherwise.  I'm not saying that your mom is definitely having a heart attack, only that it is possible that she is, and you really shouldn't ignore it.  The only way to know for sure that it is a heart attack is to be evaluated by a physician in an emergency department.  The other issue is that, in women, heart attacks don't always present in the "classic" way that everyone has heard about.  This could be a condition called unstable angina...it would take too long to explain what that is right now.  The safest thing to do would be to talk your mom into going to an ER for evaluation of her chest pain.  If you wait, and it is a heart attack, more of her heart muscle is dying with each passing minute.  If you go to an ED and it turns out not to be a heart attack, oh well...no blood no foul.  So, call EMS and try to get her to go into an ED for evaluation PLEASE, and do it NOW!|`|lz2hw676aa	I would still have her make an appt to get a heart checkup.  Chest spasms are not normal, esp if it is not heartburn etc.  It could be a warning ---sign of something more serious...that may occur...at least make a appt. soon as possible to get it checked out!  Go in to ER if it happens again...or she doesn't feel right...before you can make it to your appt.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	if the pain doesnt go away in an hour after taking 2 advil <br>  for the 'spasm', call 911|`|wnxOXBuKaa	I dunno, I think instead of an advil she should take an asprin just incase it IS a heart attack. <br>  <br>  I agree tho with the other answer of if it doesn't go away in an hour or so, then MAKE her go to the hospital
eHmyeLqJaa	that's a good start but sooner or later your going to have to increase the intensity of your workout you also will have to include some cardio into your workout like running or swimming. sometimes it takes awhile to see results but you cant give up. since you are doing 50 after a little you will have to up the amount that you do. Good luck with it.
6P27whuGaa	I would ask a medical professional, such as a doctor or pharmacist instead on the internet, not a trusted place when it comes to your health.
XK0kZ8Iiaa	A cough with bronchitis can hang on for weeks especially if shes a smoker.  If so, she should not smoke no more than she has too.  Also, I assume the doc gave her antibiotics and she should finish them. Also water will help liquefy the mucus where it will come up easier.  Drink lots of water.  Robitussin cough syrup will help bring the mucus up too.  And you do want the mucus to come up to prevent pneumonia.  No smoking in the house if at all possible.  An inhaler from the doc might help as well as nebulizer treatments.  Just know though that bronchitis hangs on quite a while. And if her mucus gets greeen, more yellow or rust colored,, then she should go back to the doctor when her antibiotics are done. Hope she feels better soon!|`|4sosXykeaa	shoe should take mucinex, it really helps get rid of the phlegm and sudafed or nyquil/dayquil are practically miracle drugs. i have similar health problems when i get allergies and all that stuff helps, except the ony thing wrong with mucinex is once the mucus is gone it can give you a bit of a sore throat.|`|FJpPCVTCaa	vitamin A and C to boost her immune system. lemons, oranges, dark leafy greens, green tea. really it's on her to supply her body with nutrients to fight off the viral infection and expel acidic waste from her system, most medications won't cure diseases. ginger can help with the sore throat, sinuses and headaches. even playing ambient crickets can help with headaches.<br>  also cucumbers can help with the nose bleeds by reducing blood pressure|`|IclOtcP9aa	i would try another doctor.....not all doctors know what their doing!!

Solitude, Seclusion, and Isolation. Lack of contact with people or love. It may stem from bad relationships, deliberate choice, contagious disease, disfiguring features, repulse of personal habits, mental illness, circumstances of employment, or situation ( or feeling as a castaway ). <br>     Short-term solitude is often valued as a time when one may work, think or rest without being disturbed. it may be desired for the sake of privacy. <br>     Health effects include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions of time and Perception. however this is the case when there is no stimulation of the sensory systems at all, and not only contact with people. Thus, by having other things to keep ones mind busy, this is avoided.<br>     Long term solitude is often seen as undesirable, causing loneliness or reclusion from the inability to establish relationships. it may even lead to clinical depression.<br>      I would get it checked out by the Doctor or this e-mail address.<br>  <br>    ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude</a> )   I hope you feel better soon.|`|MXduE0Zlaa	do you think you love her|`|6Ss31wyBaa	This sounds anxiety or depression.

1EBn5A6daa	it's probably just your body retaining water (bloating). There is really not much you can do but birth control does really help for me, if you can go to your doctor and explain these symptoms and see what they say, ask them about birth control, even if you aren't sexual active, it helps with loads of things, mine is YAZ it does wonders for my acne, bloating, emotions, and all the bad stuff associated with your period. One other thing that will definitely help is to stay away from foods/drinks that contain too much sodium, this will almost certainly make you retain water.

pvYy6iTSaa	Hi gossipgirl - "Gastritis" is an inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach.  One cause might be drinking too much strong alcohol at one time, like vodka or whiskey.  Some very strong household chemicals could also do the same such as strong cleaning acids or lye.  It could so damage the lining as to cause bleeding into the entire stomach.  An "ulcer" may be found in the lower part of the stomach, or more often, a short distance further down in the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum).  It looks like a small eaten-out cave or carved out area of inner lining. Most such ulcers are caused by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori which can be successfully treated with an antibiotic.  If not treated it can lead to fatal hemorrhage and shock.<br>  I hope this helps.
RP2QQXbjaa	Fluocinonide: used to treat inflammation/itching due to a variety of skin conditions<br>  SilvaSorb: can be used as an antimicrobial product<br>  Proshield Plus: a skin protectant containing Dimethicone<br>  Iodosorb: used for cleaning wounds <br>  <br>  These would make sense if he hand any sort of open sores or wounds.

Can't work with anyone I don't like as a person.  I like a good sense of humor and someone who finds it easy to smile. <br>   I look for intelligence. I'm well educated and intelligent.  I  don't want to work with someone who isn't my intellectual equal. <br>   I look at the titles of the books in the room. That gives me an impression.  I check out the artwork.  <br>   I ask them about their lifestyle.  I ask if they are married.  I am and I think I'd rather talk about my marriage with someone who is, or who was married. I'd rather talk to someone who has children since I have two.   I ask them to tell me their interests and hobbies.  That gives me a better picture. <br>  Was the therapist pushy?  Did the therapist assure me that they could assist me in attaining my goals.  <br>  I get the general impression during or after the interview that there is a chance that I could "connect" with this person and, after building a therapeutic relationship, (6-8 sessions) will the sessions be helpful or not.|`|4WwDTGspaa	well not real sure but I just get that feeling that this is right|`|1oBilGHuaa	I have been in therapy for a very long time as well.  <br>  For me it is important how the person responds to me.

Do you have any negative first impressions?

PevA05Ayaa	basically, if a Type 1 diabetic doesn't take their insulin they will starve to death.....<br>  <br>  Food is like the gas in a car.  The insulin (which is a hormone your pancreas makes) helps you use the food for fuel.  Without it, the food goes in one end, and out the other without giving your body any energy.  it is like pouring the gasoline on the hood of a car instead of putting it in the gas tank.<br>  <br>  When there is something wrong with the pancreas and it doesn't make insulin, then the body can't use any of the food it eats. To keep your brain going, the body will start living off of whatever fuel it can find, like your own fat.<br>  <br>  Problem is, that is really dangerous.  Body fat isn't the best fuel, so the body isn't gonna run so great, plus if you burn too much fat all at once, it builds up toxic acids in the body (called ketones).  <br>  Too much of those acids, and basically the body starts to shut down, and will go into a coma.<br>  <br>  so people with Type 1 diabetes supply themselves with insulin using shots or an insulin pump, so that their bodies can use the food they eat, and they wont starve.|`|AA12242211	Insulin is a hormone.

nZpSM7ngaa	scoliosis is how the back is being formed into an S like formation.  that doesn't sound like it at all.  you're probably just sore or something,  walk it off =P.<br>  <br>  im just kidding, put ben-gay on your back and make sure youre not freezing to death in your house.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	go see a good chiropractor it might mean you need to have an adjustment & you might be good as new.|`|c68nVKIYaa	What you describe is not inconsistent with a bad case of scoliosis. The worse the curves get, the more the twisted rib cage will restrict your breathing. A rotated spine could also affect nerves in your legs.<br>  <br>  This is definitely a condition you cannot ignore -- the symptoms are sending you a clear message. Several types of health care practitioners could help, with different methods. If the curves are fairly advanced (45+ degrees) and getting worse, an orthopedic surgeon will probably recommend what he has been trained to do -- spinal fusion. <br>  <br>  I think I answered another of your posts and recommended that you look into the Schroth method of physical therapy, which is very good at correcting breathing problems and usually effective at mitigating or eliminating pain. The pain can normally be reduced or eliminated within a few visits to the Schroth therapist. Many others (chiropractors, doctors, conventional physical therapists) often do not help for pain, or do so only short-term. I speak from personal experience, and from knowing many other scoliosis patients.|`|jRydQQNLaa	You can consult an orthopedic specialist to check your back pain and he will endorse you to a physical therapist. They will teach you some exercises how to strengthen your back. you must drink more water , numbness happens if you are dehydrated . take some exercise in the morning and evening..stretching and be healthy, drink lots of water and eat well..you might also be having an electrolyte imbalance...<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|z4LQxaA2aa	it actually sounds like a pinched nerve or a slipped disc.

When I see my flab it makes me want to exercise more and tone up!<br>  <br>  I look at pictures of my ideal figure and keep it in mind when I'm thinking about chocolate or crisps.<br>  <br>  I get my boyfriend to motivate me. When I'm being lazy he knows to encourage me to exercise, and I ALWAYS feel better afterwards.<br>  <br>  Get a training partner? Running in pairs means you can give each other encouragement and you're less likely to cancel because you won't want to let your partner down.<br>  <br>  Eating well makes me want to exercise.

These insanely overweight people (700 pounds) scare us so bad that we go out and exercise. I am in no way making fun of overweight people. I am using them as an example and as a motivation so that I don't end up like them. Also, I think of the health risks of being overweight. Diabetes, varicose veins, high cholesterol, and so on. When I exercise, I feel like I am fighting those health problems. Finally, I can be motivated to exercise more when I am with my friends. If we all jog around the neighborhood, I certainly don't want to be left behind, so I am going to push myself to keep up.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|Ddfff5psaa	To be honest I think of the pussycatdolls and their perfect bodies haha.|`|PK498w0Saa	I stand looking at my tummy sideways on in a mirror.

It is totally natural, safe and effective.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	You still take pills, and "natural" does NOT always mean better. In many cases the opposite is true. And stay away from these fad cleanses.

rDl9XR76aa	:-/ Well, honestly.. With the measurements you just gave and the fact that your probably going to have another growth spurt either pretty soon or in the next 5-6 years.. I personally don't think you need to lose that fat.<br>  <br>  And I really don't know what to tell you to help you lose it. ALTHOUGH I do know how you can tone the muscle underneath it in that area to disguise what your seeing as fat.<br>  <br>  Get on a bench, lying down on your back. (like the kind u use to lift weights or whatever..) and have your feet braced by something. Make sure that only your feet, legs, and pelvic area are on the bench. So basically from the small of your back on up, is just dangling off the end of the bench. Now do sit ups. You can scoot your butt further down on the bench and you will feel it more in the area I think your describing. <br>  <br>  If you want to strengthen your back, flip over on your belly.. And do backwards sit ups. <br>  <br>  I dunno.. They are just part of some good core exercises..

u5GQjpdAaa	First time I smoke was when I was 18. I told everyone around me that I would not fall into smoking week. Well I did and loved it. I do not smoke it now, because of my wife and my work.<br>  <br>  Weed is one of the best drugs there is, from the fact that it don't kill you from overdosing. This world would be a better place if it was legal to do. Look at Amsterdam, their crime rate is nothing. <br>  <br>  I would give up drinking and smoking cigs all together if I could smoke pot like I drink beer or something. Weed is "bad", but no one in this world will ever convince me that weed is more dangerous than Cigs or Alcohol. <br>  <br>  The only thing that I would recommend to someone is make sure you know where and whom your getting your weed from, because sometimes it can be lased with coke, or some other bad stuff.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is bad and never smoke it|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	First time I smoked weed was when I was 13 with my cousins....

I didn't get off the first time and couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  After a few more times, I "learned" how to get high.  I've used it MODERATELY for many years and don't think there is anything at all wrong with using as an ingredient in cooking.  The only caution about smoking it is that smoking anything is not good for your bronchial system.  If you use a bong with cold water and cool the smoke, it minimizes the harmful effect of the hot smoke.  I can't drink anymore due to high blood sugar, so I have 2 - 3 puffs after work in the evening.  I love to get baked!  Cigarettes are far more harmful than pot.  I quit smoking cigs a month after I tried pot.  IMO, pot should be legal.|`|t21hqvoNaa	12-13 <br>  <br>  found some guy at a skatepark followed him for hours to his house, got there there was him his brother some random girl passed out on a bed an some of my mates. quite funny really we then walked 4 even longer to find the guys house. his brother went in and came out with like an ounce. i bought some off him sat off in the woods got baked, awsome day!|`|TMYLjKnSaa	I was 11 with my best mate.<br>  I had to help her wash up but my head felt so heavy i couldnt get up lol.<br>  But 8 yrs on im a true pothead :)
kvWF1a2Yaa	Well it all depends, if he is an avid smoker, it would stay in his system for awhile, round a month or so. If he just takes a puff now and then it prolly wont show up at all.|`|OBT3C4zHaa	Depends on how often he uses. If he's a daily user it can be months. If he just smoked one time, only a couple of days.|`|lle4SvwIaa	you know you could always just give him the benefit of the doubt for the time-being, if you come across it again i be more suspicious. i really doubt that smoking it once would drastically alter the way he is acting, its kind of silly to say so...unless he's being doing it more often than that.<br>  <br>  the best way to test for marijuana would to be to have a blood test, but because it was two weeks ago, odds are he'll come up clean anyway.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|FExrXqsKaa	How much a person smokes and how often a person smokes will dictate how long marijuana stays in their system.  Being "around" it will NOT give a person a positive result.  <br>  What will you do if it's positive.  You may want to think about what you hope to accomplish by this test and what you're willing to do to address the issue if there is one.|`|Jteqao3zaa	lol, yeah, i'm sure that if he smoked once he's "acting differently"  , lol lol he's a teen, they all act "differenly"  .    some more loling, you believe him? everyone else smoked and he didn't?  lol lol lol, the answer is 6 weeks.
v3O3ae31aa	I have the Polar RS400sd heart rate monitor and I LOVE IT!  Looks like it's a bit more pricey...er  than the one you mentioned.  But mine comes with a foot pod that you can hook on your shoe and it will tell you distances on things.  It also comes with a computer program so you can transfer your data onto it and it will tell you ALL SORTS of stuff.  I like it because you can see your workout in lots of different ways like on charts and everything.  I don't know if the F6 comes with the computer program, but I think it would definitely be worth it to get one that does.  I find that I get motivated even more when I am able to see and compare my workouts that way.  You should go to the Polar website and check out all the different ones|`|8SRjELNBaa	I just got the omron hr-100c since this sunday, used it every day, so far so good.<br>  <br>  It' doesn't have the "calories burned" function, how accurate do you think those actually are for determining that???

F4DhYjlnaa	Honey - I am 32 years old and I have had my period since I was 13. I, too have not had a period since 12/2/08. Sometimes it just is that way for some women. For me, my weight, stress level, illnes, etc., can affect my period being on time. Go to the clinic and talk about your issues, but until then, don't worry too much. Irregular periods are pretty common among women.|`|VUEvviKzaa	its probably just stress, a lot of factors in your life can throw off the regular times your period comes. when i was 15 (4yrs ago) i only got my period twice in 1 year.

I don't know if they use the DSM-IV-TR in the UK, but I bet they do use it or something like it.  Here are the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Episode:<br>  <br>  A. Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same two week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.<br>  <br>  (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly everyday, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g. feels sad or empty) or observation by others (e.g. appears tearful).  Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.<br>  (2) markedly diminished interest of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly everyday (as indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others)<br>  (3) significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g. a change of more than 5% body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly everyday.<br>  (4) insomnia or hypersomnia (sleeping too much) nearly everyday<br>  (5) psychomotor agitation (speeding up of movements) or retardation (slowing of movements) -observable by others<br>  (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day<br>  (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)<br>  (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day<br>  (9) recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide) without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.<br>  <br>  Symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  Symptoms must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g. drug abuse or meds) or a general medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism).  <br>  <br>  The symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement (loss of a loved one), must last for longer than 2 months OR are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You can use these criteria as a screener.

ch4rssvlaa	No because when we dreams our brain uses objects we have seen with our eyes as symbols so people who are blind, use other things to trigger their imagination such as tastes, smells, feels.<br>  <br>  They might be a little lucky in that aspect so then they cant have dreams as scary as ours haha|`|aiBOMU9kaa	I imagine they would see things whatever way their brain interprets things to look like all the time.<br>  <br>  Whatever image they normally have of what a tree looks like, would look the same way in their dreams.|`|Lh4S3q53aa	Best question I've seen yet!  In my opinion, they do.   Blind people use there hands and touch to see. In their head they piece together the image of what is around them.  They no doubt have a mental picture of objects and thus see what cannot be seen by their eyes.  Once you capture the image of an object it would be stored of course in your memory.   <br>  <br>  So, when they dream these memories of objects pop up as if they could truly see no doubt.   I would assume their dreams aren't as vivid as someone who could see.   Maybe even blurred surroundings and unknown or imagined objects.  Then again, who knows, they could see even more then we do. <br>  <br>  For the best answer, ask a blind man!   <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. this is only my thoughts.

Unfortunately, most years we get the one that they didn't pick meaning we were given a shot that did nothing to protect us at all.Sounds like your doctor is a bit of a comedian.

I dont think you need to be worrying so much. Camp is for your enjoyment. The worst thing that could happen is that you won't be able to swim (unless you use a tampon of course). Bring pantyliners along and pads if you realyl need it. Pantyliners are good for the daytime (not swimming though!) and IF you got your period, it would hold enough until you find a pad or a tampon. I'm 13 too, and I only had my period twice. I've found it very difficult to convince my mom to let me use tampons, but good luck with yours :] Tell your counselor if you are uncomfortable with swimming with a tampon. If you really feel you need it, you can bring along back up pads. Good luck, and have fun.<br>  Your period tells you that you are now a women, and can join the club ;D<br>  ?|`|MTKC2lpxaa	lol this is so cute. wen i get my period, it stops in the water, so does some of my friends. but if you gt your while ur there, bring pads and tampons! use pads all the time around ur first time. using tampons right away aren't the best choice. but if it happens, tampon boxes come with directions on how to insert a tampon (gross! but helpful :]) if you get scared putting in a tampon, tell the counselor and they'll understand..<br>  <br>  you're not the only one! :] good luck!|`|ORUAtr0kaa	Ask her to get you pads or tampons in case. <br>  I was in the same situation, where the make you go in the pool, but I told the counselor I was on my period and couldn't use tampons because it hurt to get them in, and she let me stay out.|`|5kUxkun3aa	speak to your mum. you can take pads just in case and maybe tampons for if you have to swim. don't worry i was 16 before i got mine!|`|oLXJTK0Iaa	don't worry... i'm 13 too and it's really not that big of a deal  :)<br>  <br>  just ask your mom for tampons or pads, because if you get your period while you're there and you don't have tampons, you will have to ask someone you barely even know and that might be embarassing. the reason i say tampons and not pads, is because you said you were going to have to go in the pool and you can't go swimming while on your period if you have pads. also, in my opinion, tampons are more comfortable and you can move more freely with them, and you will need that if you're being active and camping and stuff. you should try them both out and see which one's more comfortable for you. of you like pads better, bring mostly pads and a few tampons for the pool. try to keep a little purse with tampons in it with you just in case you get your period. it's good to make sure you're prepared by having tampons or pads with you, so you don't feel like "OMG OMG OMG, what if i get my period in the middle of the woods?!?!" if you feel unusually cranky and/or start to get stomach cramps, that's a good sign that you might be getting your period. i know how embarassing it can be to talk to the councelers about these things, so you should be prepared so you won't have to be like "I NEED A TAMPON!!" to someone you barely even know.<br>  <br>  just relax, have fun!! having your period is no biggie, i promise!! as long as you have tampons with you, just in case, it will all be fine. so relax and enjoy yourself at camp!!<br>  <br>  well... sorry that answer was long, but i hope i could help!!   :)<br>  <br>  <3|`|RDL1kBtZaa	Im 13 too and dont worry about your period, its not that bad.  Id ask for some pads and stuff just in case and maybe get your mom to show you how to use tampons if you need.  Good Luck :D|`|LlEr2OdBaa	ok you will need tampons for the pool. you can't go swimming with a pad. people at these camps know what to do in those situations. there will be a camp nurse that can help you understand things too. no worries just have fun.
1lewFV8oaa	I can try to answer a few of these questions for you.  I wear eyeglasses to correct my distance vision as well in my case it is due to astigmatism.  <br>  <br>  I usually remove mine when doing close work such as reading, using the computer, or sewing since they are not needed for those tasks.  I can use them without any problems for near tasks, I just prefer not to.  If you do not need eyeglasses for computer use, then you do not have to wear them.  You have a mild prescription and probably see the computer better without eyeglasses.<br>  <br>  I usually wear mine for activities that require good distance vision such as driving, watching TV, or in a class.  <br>  <br>  As for the dark, each person is different when it comes to that.  I have better than average night vision.  I can read a book with just the light from my alarm clock.  People in general tend to see better in daylight.<br>  <br>  This link may explain night and day vision better than I can.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aoa.org/x5352.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.aoa.org/x5352.xml</a>

uY8yP8EPaa	There is nothing wrong with having OCD. <br>  I can't diagnose you (only a professional really can) but if you do have it I'd say it's just a mild case. <br>  I also do strange things, like having to step on the same number of cracks on the ground for each foot.<br>  So just don't worry too much about it! :)|`|xwz6yZYlaa	i'm not sure this is ocd.. the first part about touching things to make sure nothing bad happens sounds a bit like ocd.<br>  but the part about checking your room to see if anyone is in there sounds more like paranoia, to me. <br>  sometimes, i go back and hit my alarm clock button a bunch of times just to make sure that my alarm clock will get me up in the morning, kinda weird, yes, but it is somewhat of ocd. & everything has to be neat & tidy in my life. thats pretty much ocd.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	The touching things sounds like OCD and counting. With the checking your room, A LOT of people do that. I always think there's someone under the bed or in the closet and I'm a grown woman.|`|ypGzS34aaa	Here is a link to the test professionals use to diagnose OCD.<br>  <a href="http://www.brainphysics.com/ybocs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.brainphysics.com/ybocs.php</a>|`|m389Isf0aa	I do that, but I don't think it is out of control.  I check my alarm like 20 times to make sure its on...  A few other things, I think its pretty normal..|`|5XfwXFbjaa	You should consult a doctor, but to me it sounds like you do have compulsions.|`|80Dyljhdaa	Yes...I have it, that those are pretty much the symptoms....you need to go see a shrink.|`|c7lxlcEbaa	could be...I have OCD, I have to return to my apt door 5 times before im convinced i cloised it|`|gDFPCdboaa	If it doesn't hurt your quality of life any, I wouldn't worry about it.  I used to have lots of OCDs, and they never caused me much trouble.  For example: I went through a phase where I had to touch all four legs of a chair I sat in several times before I could feel relaxed.  And do you know what's really weird?  I came to enjoy the OCD!  Yes, I actually derived pleasure from performing the chair leg-touching ritual!  But the need to touch chair legs has now passed.<br>  <br>  For me, OCDs come and go, and they're not really much of a problem.  I don't have any right now.  I imagine that I might in the future.<br>  <br>  For crying out loud, don't consume some lousy chemical to deal with your OCD as some of these goofs are suggesting!  Side effects are almost always worse.|`|GxBDYocGaa	You could have and you might not no one can tell you for sure except a doctor.<br>  <br>  You can try seeing about consulting a therapist or doctor who may suggest certain prescriptions.  Relaxing by yoga or exercise may help you too by making you not over think things too much.|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	It sounds like you do have OCD, but I am not a professional.<br>  <br>  I suggest you make an appointment to see your doctor and explain why you think you have it and ask the doc.  <br>  <br>  Your doctor will probably refer you to a psychiatrist who can correctly diagnose you.<br>  <br>  There are medications.  There is also therapy that can help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|JQcxBneGaa	go see a dr. house<br>  jajajaja<br>  <a href="http://www.bukisa.com/articles/39633_a-humble-brazilian-woman" rel="nofollow">http://www.bukisa.com/articles/39633_a-h...</a>|`|i5H1CNgOaa	I have OCD as well and I touch things a certain number of times too. But I think checking to see if someone is in your room is an entirely different thing.|`|vCQXfFv8aa	I might have OCD also go to a doctor I'm going to a neurologist.|`|eYiYCnb5aa	Nobody online can answer that.<br>  You shouldnt be asking that question here, you should go see a therapist.  Only they can tell you if you do or not.|`|onxVq6OVaa	You do show some signs of mild ocd. Go see a psycologist sweetheart and good luck they are expensive|`|trw2Kuygaa	Try Meditating.  Just sounds to me like you are a bit nervous about things.|`|sFcemJkGaa	maybe your just spirtiual haha i dunno the word im looking for but like you believe in ghosts and things like that|`|ZPTf22ihaa	it can be OCD .. consult a psychiatrist to exclude or confirm it|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Go see a therapist.|`|vCTo2ZkOaa	OMG when I read your question I flipped out I have the SAME prob!!! I am ocd but there is nothing to fix it really.|`|pEccQrcTaa	hmm maybe<br>  go see your doc to make sure|`|7c4a5e9Caa	See a doctor. They can diagnose you.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	I think I have it and I am seeing a counsellor. First time on monday ahhhh|`|iybezfi6aa	I can't say for sure, but a friend of mine has it and she describes similar thoughts. Especially about thinking something bad will happen if she doesn't do certain things.<br>  Rather than a therapist, I would recommend a psychiatrist who will be able to diagnose you and prescribe meds that work for this disorder.|`|OFGE01tRaa	accept the condition you are in at this point. work hard to reduce your stress and take good care of yourself and let a lot of time pass.<br>  <br>  never listen to all the quacks and do gooders. your mind has been overstressed by something. it doesn't matter what or why. smile, stay out of the fast lane and allow plenty of time for mother nature to work. you might be amazed at the things that can be stressfu. even  the even news is stressing me out. just concentrate on taking good care of your body while the mind heals. <br>  <br>  is is kind of like post traumatic disorder, i think. keep away from stress and loud, lively situations. it is rest time, every day. just glide low and below the radar.|`|ilrSUcMvaa	if it is disrupting your life go get it fixed before it gets worse. i have ocd not too bad but not too good either and i hate it. i am always trying to make myself do things i dont want to to get over it. like not wash my hands 2 much or not check everything 50 million times before i leave. talk to your doc they will help u with options if u need it.|`|85f5b4fcd39d295459a2a6ee7d6d0b87aa	ask your doctor to test you
WXExyAlWaa	Stress is one of the major growing problems in youth these days, particularly in high school and university. We place so much focus on performing well that it's like a vice. You should try to divide up your time.... schedule specific blocks of the day for things that will relax you. Try not to procrastinate on tasks that will stress you if you have to do them at the last minute.<br>  <br>  It might help to talk to your teachers about this as well. They might be able to help somehow, or give you some pointers on dealing with everything.<br>  <br>  Try to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, too. This sounds silly but it does boost your mood and energy, and every little bit helps.|`|neUiCEB3aa	For your stress, make a schedule (making sure to give yourself some free time).<br>  <br>  For every negative thought you have, tell yourself to think of something positive. =)|`|YS4752geaa	go out with ur friends do some u love to do have fun
lIpjuMTHaa	Woman on top or doggy style are the best.|`|8j7FCEOraa	My husband and I do it missionary, but then he picks up both of my legs with his arms. I use my arms to help him hold them up if he gets tired. But. It's. AWESOME. He hits the perfect spot. He really likes doing it too lol.|`|GorLnhiCaa	Some women like to be on top as it gives control more conducive to getting an orgasm than being pinned under a man. '69' is also a good position. but everyone is different so you wii have to find out what does the most for her.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	isnt every woman different? <br>  you make it sound like all women like the same position|`|MXRXG62oaa	make sure you rub the clits. also 69 is awwwwwesome!|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Go down and do it very well. Confidence is key.|`|5jZdHPMwaa	My boyfriend loves doggy<br>  me on the other hand- not too fond of it..<br>  what i love is one called the Drill.<br>  DEEP penetration. she'll love it. i know i do. <br>  Also another one called Pirate's Bounty.<br>  Girl laying down, legs outward around him, him kneeling, thrusting inside her, while lifting one of her legs up onto his shoulder.<br>  Very nice. She'll like that one too.<br>  <br>  Here are more ideas. Once you get comfortable enough with her, show her this site and you two can try out all these awesome positions. Worked for me and my guy ;)|`|A5WI3ctPaa	get lotion and give her a massage and just talk to her.<br>  <br>  maybe girls do not want sex all the time. <br>  <br>  girls like guys who communicate.<br>  <br>  it justs depends on the girl<br>  <br>  <br>  or...........<br>  <br>  <br>  lay on your stomach naked<br>  <br>  and talk dirty to her<br>  <br>  that will turn her on|`|pvjZEIDRaa	I've never had sex before, but I know when I do I want his hands all over my body! So any position where your hands are free will be great. Maybe you sitting/lying down and her on top? Simple, but I'm sure it would work.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	I like any position that feels good, so pretty much, all of them!

eYiYCnb5aa	Its not just guys who have sex dreams, girls have sex dreams too.<br>  <br>  Don't stress about it.  Fantasies and dreams are 2 different things anyway.  A human mind is a very powerful thing.  Half the things many people dream about, were never thought about by them.  Your mind takes memories of what happened in their day, or throughout their life and just twists it around.<br>  <br>  Seriously, there is nothing to worry about.  People cannot control their dreams.|`|RIDwzLfaaa	Its weird but dreams usually come from what u have on your mind. So obviously he thought about it but wont confess to it. I dont think he's interested in her because he would of never told you about the dream. But maybe it just crossed his mind one day, guys are guys.|`|zaprmHVxaa	Well a lot of the time sex dreams are purely to make you ejaculate and prevent testicular damage rather than a manifestation of feelings. I wouldn't worry about it. I've had totally random sex dreams with people I hadn't ever thought about like that.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	Dreams take on many forms this whole idea of <br>  <br>  ((O I don't think about third that & the 3rd so why am I dreaming it)) is nothing but hog wash no ones exactly why dreams occur the way they do but what we do know is the mind & subconscious level is complex|`|9EVcTnUWaa	It's perfectly normal for both men and women to have dreams that are sexual in nature.  Men have more of these dreams than women because men think about sex more than women and sex in general means more to them.  But as a woman who had her first orgasm at the age of 9 I know that women also have dreams that revolve around sex.|`|KwjVZOseaa	Having a dream isn't necessarily representative of a true fantasy. You could have a dream that your aunt was riding around on a tricycle naked before you had intercourse with her. This does not meen that you do actually want this to happen, nor do is meen you find this an erotically pleasing fantasy.<br>  I wouldn't worry about it at all.|`|htD82ij1aa	not all dreams "mean something" if it was reoccurring it might ( if u believe that kind of thing.)  Dreams are just kind of a mush up of random things our brains have stored up.  Activities, people, and places.  It's nothing to worry about; he told you about the dream cause it seemed weird to him right, so he doesn't have a thing for your friend or he would've kept the dream to himself.|`|y2XKYhsyaa	dreams cant really be explained. ive had sex dreams about random people that i wouldnt have thought about if i wasnt dreaming.|`|MTJs95Emaa	Girls have them too. It just happens everyonce in a while. I had one about my brother once...ugh. It was disgusting! I don't even know where it came from. I couldn't even look at him the next day.
muHctmaGaa	I second the person who mentioned an iron deficiency. My periods don't affect me beyond having to take a scalding bath the first night to soothe thigh cramps.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	why dont you talk with your dr if you get real dizzy. that is not right.<br>  <br>  I do everything i usually do|`|9cLkF6wqaa	i feel really lazy and can't concentrate, plus it seems like everything is going wrong, but i dont feel dizzy, hmm, thats weird, ya i just carry on with my normal life. but ya that sucks that you get dizzy, is that normal?|`|N1ay8hzFaa	You probably have pretty low iron. Try to eat foods that have more iron in them. If that doesn't help, go to a doctor and get a blood test. You might need to take iron supplements.|`|550eVd5Baa	Yeah.. I lay down sometimes. Try doing what you normally do... You'll get use to it?

L9BvnAXSaa	You sound like you have Tourettes Syndrome.  A doctor called a neurologist can confirm this diagnosis.  If you have it there are some meds and also support groups you can join.  I would talk to your parents or guardian and start to explore this.  You are not crazy.|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	I agree with the previous poster - Tourette's is the first thing I thought of, too. But have you seen a doctor about this?|`|DBUmR8FTaa	you need to see a doctor before these symptoms get worse|`|neUiCEB3aa	i'm probably not right, but the first thing that came to mind was tourrettes. (idk about the spelling of that lol)
hjHBcpiPaa	I haves pimples too and there so annoying. What I usually do is wash my face with St. Ives apricot scrub or the nutrogena wave thing. My skin has gotten clearer also.

UL3XOKJxaa	Unfortunately your crown will not change with time...the good news is that if it is too white you could try bleaching to blend the colors. The crown will not change but the other teeth should. If that doesn't work you may have to see the dentist and have them re-do the crown. Good Luck|`|NmqMKHvWaa	One of the hardest treatments in dentistry is to match a crowned  anterior tooth with the adjacent ones.  That being said however, your doc should make a determined effort to make this match.  In our office, we place the crown on with a weak cement for a day and have the patient approve of the shade before we cement it on permanently. You need to call the office and go back in to see what they will do. As suggested, it may be possible to bleach your other teeth to match but you should not have to bear this cost.
FfixEIbVaa	What you're having sounds like a series of PVC's. (Premature Ventricular Contractions.) <br>  These happen when a chamber in your heart just beats to early. It feels like a strong thump, or a missed beat? Maybe a deep or heavy fluttering?<br>  Don't worry,<br>  these can happen from having too much caffeine, anxiety, not having enough sleep.. anything along the lines of that. <br>  <br>  PVC's are harmless, <br>  but if they occur more than 4 times a minute then you should seek some help from a doctor.<br>  <br>  I'm 15 and i've had PVC's for almost two years now.<br>  (:<br>  <br>  Don't stress about them,<br>  they can go away on there own.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	I have had a heart murmur all of my life and have never had spasms.  <br>  Click below and see if this website helps answer your questions.<br>  You really did not give us enough information.

Why would you TRY to get sick?<br>  <br>  Or if you really just need to vomit something that was somewhat poisonous, then maybe that's not actually getting SICK. It's just induced vomiting to get rid of a poison.

wgtjMcjEaa	The clear ones are more expensive, and they are ceramic. I personally don't like them because although they are clear, certain foods stain them, and they just make your teeth look gross. I guess it doesn't really matter because they are temporary, but you might as well go with the cheapest option, because in the end you are going to get the same result--a beautiful smile :)|`|DI3u9gMSaa	Ali, normal ones are always best.  I have a combination of both - clear on uppers and metal on lowers.  Because your lower teeth are smaller, go with metal ones on those because metal ones are most effective for smaller teeth.  <br>  <br>  Clear braces cost several hundred dollars more.  They look better but it depends on you if the extra hundred is worth aesthetics.<br>  <br>  I put up pictures of the clear and metal braces on my teeth on my site (below).  Hope this helps!|`|Fue5b9wmaa	They are clear. easily put. It depends on what kind. there are some that are a series of retainers that are very hard to see. my mother just had normal clear braces and thy were less noticeable but if you see them once you see them everytime.

If you don't like the way you feel on the nuva ring then go back to your doctor and have them change your script or dose. If you were on the ring because you don't like trying to remember to take the pill every day then you may want to look into another option like the depo shot, the patch, or even an IUD.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|ZARozVAHaa	YAZ it amazing i take it and it really does work

qL8cLuRwaa	Well i have Aortic Stenosis(im 15) and when ever i do physical type of activities, such as sports i get very out of breath. My aortic valve doesn't work very well, so i get very out of breath, and have trouble breathing when im running, or doing physical activity, and it just completely drains me. Also my Aortic Regurgiation, makes me out of breath during physical activity, since my blood flow is leaking back into my heart, and so my heart has to make up for that loss of blood and oxygen. So those are a couple you can look up if you want.|`|AA10301974	What is more likely is that if your characters goes above a certain physical limit he will start having breathing problems, and circulation problems that go away soon after the characters gets back under the physical limit. <br>  <br>  For instance I have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The flesh on the lower portion of my heart is thickening, changing the shape of the chambers and creating problems for the valves. My physical limit walking on a flat surface is around 3 to 4 mph. If I go above that for a little bit, my legs turn heavy and then the feeling slowly moves from my legs to everywhere else. Until my chest turns heavy, I'm fine and can keep going. <br>  <br>  Once my chest turns heavy I'm in huge amount of trouble. If I had stopped when my legs tire and let the feeling pass, a little dizzyness that might last a minute is the only cost. If I push as long as I'm able the cost is I get to find a spot on the floor quickly, either by choice or lack of strength. For the next 5 to 20 minutes, I've never pushed hard enough to blacked out, is pure misery. No matter how I lay I can't get comfortable. No matter how much I breath my entire body feels as if I'm suffocating, just without the actual suffocating part. In the worst cases my limbs might start tingling painfully, but that is rare. <br>  <br>  The moment the feeling goes away I'm only slightly more tired than I was before the episode happened. I can and have gotten right back up and continued to finish another half hour workout on a treadmill. <br>  <br>  I find flat surfaces easy. I have extreme trouble with stairs and steep hills. On times that I'm tired going two floors up my stairs will cause enough dizziness to make it difficult to walk in a straight line. Working with my arms is not a problem. Heavy work with my legs requires much more blood movement, and forces me to slow down or suffer the consequences. Just walking up a hill means planning to stop every one or two blocks to let the feelings of dizziness and the extra weight pass before continuing. <br>  <br>  Obviously it is worse or better depending on how advanced the condition is and how physically fit the person is. If I was 50 pounds lighter I could run short distances with how advanced my condition is without a problem. My sister was physically fit when this same condition was advanced enough to stop her every 20 feet to rest at the age of 26 before she had surgery to correct the condition.

But sugar free or not, it doesn't have enough calories that you have to worry about it.|`|uTSOYVJSaa	yeah, most have about five. Most of the time they aren't fat calories though. Even if they were, 5 fat calories is a little more than half a gram of fat, so don't worry.|`|rkePX77Xaa	look on the ingredients and it will tell you how many calories that are in each piece|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	what does the package say ?|`|3gBJfGNjaa	Most gum does. But, on average, you would burn 11 calories just by chewing it for an hour.

tIldpr7vaa	good diet ( low calorie and limit carbs ) and lots of intense cardio ( running, jogging..)and u WILL lose weight. As long as u keep it up and dont cheat on ur diet.<br>  <br>  diet pills r worthless anyway, it takes hard work to lose fat. Diet pills will do VERY little to help, and theyll do nothing alone.|`|FxWppY7Baa	There is not such thing as organic weight loss pills. Simply because the USDA organic program does not regulate pills of any kind. this means a diet pill manufacturer can put the word organic on their label without having a single organic ingredient in the pill. No diet pill is safe.<br>  <br>  The only way to lose weight is to cut calorie intake and increase exercise. Not that is not easy or even fun but over time if you really do this you will lose weight.<br>  <br>  Learn to cook and eat whole organically grown foods. Do not drink soda (even diet), stay a way from all processed foods, especially those with high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils and start reading labels. Walk a couple of miles a day, start riding a bike, get on an athletic team-something that will get your heart rate up for at least 30 minutes 4 to 6 times a week.|`|xzR3H2gYaa	I would say no, I think taking any pill in general for weight loss is a bad idea.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend you try a low glycemic diet google (low glycemic), it is really not that difficult once you get used to it, I am doing this myself.  Trust me if you stick to it you "will" lose weight and if you are starting to get frusterated because for some reason you stop losing after you a while...don't worry it is completly normal, it is called a plateau but it will pass and you start to lose again...just dont give up and get plenty of excersise.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!  =)
urWEFRciaa	Hello<br>  I am so sorry to hear about your mother's cancer. I do not agree with the previous answer that magnets have no effect on pain. I do not know about the pain from cancer but there is evidence that magnotherapy can help the pain of arthritis. There was a study done on the effectiveness of magnets on pain and the article was published in the BMJ (British Medical Journal). You can read more about this study via the arthritis page on the website Natural Ways For Women.|`|dpgXzMenaa	Old wive's tales, both of those ideas.  Myths.<br>  <br>  Magnets and copper do nothing at all for pain.|`|AA11539543	My fella has osteoporosis and osteoarthritis and he swears the copper bracelets he wears do more good than any medication he has ever been given . His theory is that it is the green oxidisation or corrosion that the copper leaves on the skin that helps as the magnets usually fall out in a short while and it makes no difference .<br>  <br>  Regardless of this his surgeon is one of the best in the UK and guess what he wears exactly the same bracelet a cheap ￡2.50 band of copper . When asked about this the surgeon shrugged and with a rueful smile admitted we don't know everything about medicine yet .<br>  <br>  Get your mum one for each wrist and the cheaper it is the better it will work that's my fellas advise

YendeHbraa	Hi,<br>  It sounds like you are doing the right amount of exercise a week. Exercise is a really important way to keep healthy! Make sure that you are eating right too. Lots of lean protiens (fish and chicken) and not too much snack foods. After a long practice try to eat a healthy dinner. You might find that you are hungrier not that you are working out more so keep and apple on hand so if u need energy or have the urge to snack you always have something healthy! <br>  <br>  good luck|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Make you taller?

eO6GqpOqaa	yes they are contagious and can spread if touched on another part of your body. The best thing to do is go to your doctor and get it freezed off. They can do it in 5 minutes and all it just turns to a scab and never comes back. It doesn't really even hurt, just stings a little. Its nothing to worry about and won't spread overnight, maybe a month or a year. No rush to go to the doctor unless you really find it ugly and unbearable to look at.

That's how long I stayed in America until I came back to Jamaica. When I had my checkup before school I had lost over 20 odd pounds|`|kvog6ICCaa	Any excersise involving your lower body will help. For an at-home excersise, get on your hands and knees then lift one leg up with your thigh parallel to the ground and your calf at a right angle to your thigh. Lift your leg up and down about fifty times then switch legs. You can also lay on your back with your hands under your butt and keeping your legs straight lift them straight up in the air. Bring them down to about half a foot above the ground, then repeat. This will work the front of your thighs and your lower abs.

3UlGbeDBaa	It could be one of two things:  If you eat too much at one sitting, then this will happen.  Just too much food in your stomach at once at it has to be digested so can't go any faster than the body works.  Or it could be a food allergic reaction.<br>  From your age and weight, I will guess you are consuming too much food at one sitting.<br>  Can you give an example of what you would consume at one sitting & post it here, please.  That would help me consider which is more likely a reason.<br>  Thanks.

lEX3CjWlaa	It's called 'rebound'. Sometimes the sudden cessation of an anti-depressant causes symptoms to be worse then they were before you started the medication. Usually when you go off an anti-depressant you need to wean yourself slowly from it. You might take 3/4 of the usual dosage for a week, then 1/2 etc. until you're off and hopefully symptom free.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to speak to your doctor and refill your prescription ASAP unless another one is recommended.<br>  <br>  You might want to check: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal.</a><br>  <br>  Good luck and Hope this Helps|`|EFN07cfxaa	becuase you were on the pills when you didn't classify yourself as depressed but now that you are off of them you are, because you got used to them

It can cause you to have hypertension, headaches and migranes, and the list really goes on and on.  <br>  <br>  One thing i've tried lately is that when i get stressed out about some silly little thing, i try to look at the 'bigger picture,' as in "Will I even care about this in 2 weeks or 1 month or 2 years?"  etc.  It just helps put things in perspective; a way of asking your self if something is worth stressing about

ytGaDM7Haa	First off ditch all the trans fats, just make it a rule that you will not eat anything with hydrogenated oil in it. Also cut out high fructose corn syrup. If you don't eat those two things (which are both very bad for you) it really limits the options (in a good way). As long as you aren't eating those two things, let yourself indulge every once in a while. <br>  I am also too thin (or was before I was pregnant), and I allow myself to eat as much fat as I want so long as it isn't trans fats. The fats I take though are probably about 70% olive oil, 15% butter, 10% other vegetable oils, 5% omega fatty acids (supplement that I put on my food). This is an estimate, but yeah, I cook mainly with olive oil and allow myself to put as much as I want on my food (same with butter).|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Eat fruit? :D<br>  I eat less sugary stuff now 'cause I want fruit.<br>  <br>  Or you could try veggies too.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  Every time you want a sweet snack, go for a fruit and try to drink 1 gallon of water per day.|`|FGfl9tqdaa	instead of eating the sugar foods, try to eat white meat that will fill up your cravings.|`|66CBNVtGaa	Well when u want an unhealthy food go and grab some gum.If u still r hungry then drink some juice or water.I hope this helps BI :)|`|Xg9tvcOJaa	you should eat a fruit or more veg. and drink at least in one day 8 bottles of water

It has a lot of sugar!|`|2A6ik87iaa	Yes you will definitely lose 10 pounds but in a very unhealthy way. You'll just gain back ALL the weight and even more. Your meals aren't even that healthy. Caesar salad dressing is packed with calories and sugar, if you want to have salad try an oil based dressing. I used renee's fig balsamic vinaigrette. Grilled cheese isn't the healthiest food to eat everyday. Try having cereal in the morning that isn't loaded with sugar. I highly recommend Kashi products they're organic and tastey. For snacks have some fruit(apple with peanut butter is great or even celery with peanut butter). Make salads but fill them will different, colourful vegetables.<br>  I have a wii fit at home and it's great for beginner's who want to lose weight. But once it starts to get too easy, go for a jog around your neighborhood or join a gym.<br>  I really hope my advice helps and sorry it's so long.|`|xuO7wXNSaa	yeah i think u might even lose more than 10 pounds.

ezWowoBxaa	Walking is exercising, don't underestimate yourself! How much do you walk each day? Any type of cardio is great (running, jogging, biking, walking) - especially if someone does it around 5x a week. That's awesome you eat healthy, that's the hardest part for some people when they want to loose weight. No one really likes to exercise, but as long as your keeping that blood flowing it will help you get a little more fit, as well as help you trim down! If you have the time to walk a few miles around the block, track, treadmill, etc. - it should help you out!

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Most blame the prostaglandins that are released to stimulate uterine muscles to contract and help shed the endometrium.  Prostaglandins are responsible for your cramps.  The hormone also irritates joints, which is why women sometimes complain of flu like symptoms, joint pain, and fatigue.  The same pain relievers that help with cramps will work for the associated joint pains.  You want something like Motrin or Naproxen Sodium (Aleve), which have anti-inflammatory properties, rather than Tylenol which doesn't.  Fortunately as the level of prostaglandin drops, the aches in the joints should also go away.

dpgXzMenaa	It's surprising to see how many people really don't know what viagra does at *all*.<br>  <br>  1) it *lowers* your blood pressure.  (that's actually what it was intended for before its developers discovered it had a "sexual side effect" that they could sell)<br>  <br>  2) it doesn't make you horny, but it *does* increase your sensitivity to stimulation by allowing the genital tissues to engorge more fully with blood.<br>  <br>  3) it will make you wetter, because that's part of the result of more full engorgement of the tissues inside your vagina.<br>  <br>  4) if you're not one of those women who's too sensitive for touch right after an orgasm, it can make it *much* easier for you to have multiples by keeping you engorged and sensitive after orgasm.<br>  <br>  5) it's often prescribed "off-label" for women who're having difficulties with arousal and orgasm due to antidepressant meds.<br>  .|`|9ntoGPFyaa	That's like having a guy take Vagasil|`|CBgDc1Auaa	sure.. you take half he takes half.. supposed to increase a womans labido!<br>  <br>  go for it..<br>  <br>  have fun you two!|`|PImvmP1paa	Viagra should only be taken by men with erectile dysfunction. <br>  <br>  You don't have a penis.|`|EDCW5t9Vaa	viagra was not made for women and given the fact that you have high blood pressure is a definite NO!|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Try vibrell or whatever that thing is for women|`|CNZn1qhJaa	This question; it fails.|`|ANsznbWsaa	There are much better ways for you to get aroused.... and I've never heard of it working for a woman... it's not supposed to.

When a male says he's "Rock Hard", it means that he's as hard as possible. This usually occurs when the male is close to orgasm or at as high an arousal point as possible. As for the "How did you do it so fast?" part, he could mean that in a good way or bad way. He could mean that you went quickly and isn't used to girls doing so. You'll have to talk to him about that. Hope this helps.|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Rock hard means he feels his penis can't get any harder and that is a good thing.

YendeHbraa	Hi,<br>  yes, you can still drink diet soda. Diet is better than regular. Diet soda, however, has a lot of bad ingredients including sweetners. When I want something carbonated I try to drink soda water with lemon or lime. Its actually pretty good and has zero calories!!|`|Ahx8k7Baaa	Diet Soda is one of the worst things for you. I don't drink soda but when  I do I drink regular soda. The artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are like poison to humans. Visit the website I provided and I garuntee you never use artificial sweeteners again.|`|xzR3H2gYaa	Yes you can but it may also cause more surgar cravings and yes it may also lead to cancer but I think you only have to worry about this if you drink it everyday for years.|`|3INX48lgaa	I suppose you can because it doesn't have sugar,carbs etc. Although it does have a huge amount of sodium so I would drink it occasionally.|`|2Utx6skNaa	you can but i wouldn't suggest pop at all<br>  even diet has bad things for your body<br>  and dont think of it as a diet its a life change unless you think youll gain it all again once your done with your "diet"|`|M9tH99gfaa	its 0 calories and sugar so it wont make u gain weight or anything...but its not exactly healthy =p water is always better<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah5y5W.8aiE4ayWR3rDKmpvsxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304150647AAiMpnQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  answer please!|`|gwindStOaa	no... diet soda is really bad for you...because it has aspartame in it which is really bad for you!|`|XTfr3uKQaa	Well you can, but I wouldn't recommend it.<br>  The bad thing about soda is it has lots of chemicals that are hard on your body, and anything that is hard on your body makes it harder for you to lose weight.<br>  <br>  What's even worse about diet soda is that almost all of it has Aspartame, which is like the devils. It took years and years for this chemical to even be approved to be in foods, and there is still so much controversy over it cause its so bad for you. Now i know you're thinking "who cares, i just wanna lose weight" but the thing is is that aspartame actually causes the toxins to build up in your body, and prevents fat cells from dissolving and leaving your body cause it preserves them. This causes CELLULITE. Aspartame actually stores fat in your body, and makes it harder for you to lose weight.<br>  <br>  So i mean, I'm not a fanatic, if you're at the movies and want some diet soda with your popcorn to save you some calories then sure, go ahead, but dont make this a regular habit, it will only hurt you in the end. Read "skinny *****" the book to find out more about what aspartame does.|`|bFnIipyxaa	The problem with diet soda is that, yes, it's better for you than regular-but it contains artificial sugar that, when consumed, will trick your body, making it think it's real-and when you don't get the real sugar, you will get extra hungry, your body will expect sugar but isntead gets fake sugar. Watch out, because it can make you over eat. I would suggest that you drink diet soda maybe twice a week or less...treat yourself once in a while!|`|DBUmR8FTaa	no it is diet soda water would be better however|`|Awo7g1K4aa	Well yea.|`|BFYQ7lPTaa	Diet Soda isn't good because it's sweetened with "Splenda", or artificial sweetener. If you're trying to lose weight in the abdomen/stomach area, don't drink it because your body automatically stores the fat from Splenda there, since it's not a natural sweetener. However, remember during a diet, everything in moderation...|`|6etaFOnhaa	you CAN but soda is really unhealthy. <br>  if you thumbs down, youre ignorant. <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304151821AAjGB9I&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|66CBNVtGaa	Well it depends if u want to seriously loose some weight then lay off the soda.If u just want to loose a couple of pounds then just drink it just make sure that its DIET soda.I hope this helped BI :)|`|3RbkVPViaa	No, but I would only drink one a day.

0a28adb3d53d2d2bd9b33d21c897e227aa	You get UTIs from not drinking water, drinking sodas or caffeine (teas) and of it also depends on what bacteria is causing the UTI.  So holding your pee will not be the only factor to get you sick with a UTI.  If you get it, it is most likely the e-coli bacteria (most commom) or others like proteus mirabilis and others.  <br>  <br>  If you are starting to get a UTI, your pee will start to get cloudy and you may have some pain.  Most UTIs are painful when you pee, you also can get cramps and not urination pain or both.  <br>  <br>  I hope  you don't have a UTI.  To prevent it.. drink Cranberry juice lots of water and hopefully you can avoid it.  Take care.|`|AA10450066	You won't get one from holding it.You are young and have a very strong bladder.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	According to healthatoz.com, you are within your healthy weight range.(It says between 92-123lbs is within a healthy weight range) If you want a toned body, it is not necessarily that you want to lose weight, however that usually occurs. You can try lifting weights to build up lean muscle. Eating a lot of protein helps build muscle as well. <br>  <br>  Weight is not as important as much as body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI) and your goal should be to maintain a healthy BMI and body fat %. Typically, girls have about 22% body fat. (I think that might be for athletes) <br>  <br>  Once again healthatoz.com says you have a normal BMI of 20 (the normal range is 18.5-24.9)<br>  <br>  You can also do cardio such as jogging/running, get on a bicycle or anything like that. Hope this helps.|`|rjfft8WZaa	How old are you?  If you are still growing (and at 4'11" and 99 lbs I assume you are) then don't try to make changes, as there is a possibility that they will occur naturally.  I had a friend who was overweight until around 7th grade, and then he grew a few inches, trimmed down naturally, and was happy with his weight.

sBZN0GWRaa	Herpes is a virus, it is not affected by antibiotics.  It can only be transferred by direct contact with an open sore, not through saliva or other body fluids.  If the person had an open sore on their mouth, it is possible that you could have contracted the virus, otherwise there is no way.|`|4OKE5zAlaa	What kind of herpes do they have- genital or oral? Oral herpes are the same thing as cold sores, if you've ever had one then you have oral herpes. About 50-80 percent of the population has them, but many people show no symptoms. <br>  <br>  The herpes virus dies quickly when exposed to air if it's not on someone's skin. If you drank out of their cup/glass, there is only a significant chance that you could get it if they had a cold sore at the time. If they did, the virus will die within seconds of being exposed to the air. If you drank out of their glass within about 10 seconds, I'd say you're at risk, but only a very small one.<br>  <br>  If they have genital herpes, there is no chance because herpes is only spread through skin contact. So if your mouth didn't touch their genitals, you are fine.<br>  <br>  Still, there's a chance you already have the virus but show no symptoms. There's also a chance that if you do catch the virus from them, you will never show the symptoms. It all depends. Either way, I don't think it's much to worry about.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: The antibiotics have nothing to do with it. Antibiotics treat bacteria. Herpes is a virus.|`|0HYG8PlNaa	Antibiotics are only good for Bacterial infections not viral infections. I am sorry call your doctor. Also What kind of herpes?|`|D8SpQAgLaa	There are 2 kinds of diseases - Viruses and Bacteria. Viruses inject DNA into your cells, reprogramming your cells to make copies of the same virus, whereas bacterial infections just live in between your cells. Because Bacteria are alive, they can be killed with antibiotics, however Viruses are just chunks of DNA enclosed in a protective layer of proteins, they are not alive, so they cannot be killed with antibiotics. Herpes is a Virus, not a bacteria, so antibiotics will do absolutely nothing to protect you against it.|`|AA11657356	Yes. Herpes is not a bacterial disease which can be cured with antibiotics, it is viral. You should avoid making skin on skin contact with anyone who has a visible sore and sharing any sort of drink.|`|0231d2843faa4847a6c7ee14ea2b73f5aa	Yes you can.  Antibiotics only fight off bacteria not virus infections.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	If they had herpes on their mouth then yes. The chances are small if they weren't having a flare up and even smaller if you cleaned your face and mouth soon after. It is transmitted by contact.

WxV9P9NQaa	bikini wax (it hurts like hell)|`|YIlP4yNaaa	Pubic hair is very erotic. It adds a lot of mystery and intrigue. A lot of guys love to play with a woman's pubic hair - run their fingers through it... rub their nose on it... <br>  <br>  Fully shaven looks very unnatural..... it exposes things and make a woman look like a little girl...<br>  <br>  A lot of marketing pressure has made it a trend for women to use a lot of different ways to get rid of pubic hair... Some of these are actually very unhealthy... You could absorb a lot of chemicals in the process...<br>  <br>  At some point, the trend is going to reverse and women will return to leaving their pubic hair natural or just trimming it lightly... I think that trend has already started... Compared to about 5 years ago, fewer women are concerned about keeping it fully shaved now.|`|pvjZEIDRaa	I find shaving hurts a lot...and I break out when I do. Trimming it can be a good solution, just do it with scissors. Also, for the areas further down, and closer to your butt, I find shaving there doesn't hurt at all, but you have to be VERY CAREFUL!!
XtDEUKVsaa	Yes, talk to your doctor tomorrow about it. I was diagnosed with "acute situational anxiety"... which was taken very seriously. All it meant was that I was going through a very stressful time in my life (helping run the family business, my younger brother's behavior, problems with my boyfriend)... anyways one day I got super stressed out and started having panic attacks and I was prescribed a generic zanax. They only prescribed me 5 of the pills but the point of my story is that if you are having any problems, you definitely need to speak with your doctor. The sooner the better... you don't want things to get too far along to where there might not be any help for you.<br>  <br>  I really hope the best for you sweetheart.

fDGesUPJaa	Pads for sure.  For starters, they're much easier.  All you do is unwrap it, pull the plastic thing off it, put it in your underwear and pull up your underwear.  Then once you're wearing it, its easy to know when you need a change.  With tampons, first of all, they will hurt a lot.  Second of all, you might have trouble inserting it -- its not easy.  And last, even if you insert it right, you can't really tell when you need a change like you can when you're wearing a pad.|`|9vCLgQHIaa	Try pads at first but if they're uncomfortable and you don't like them then try tampons.

SZgOodf1aa	Well, the short answer is that you MIGHT have asthma based on what you described, but there are several respiratory conditions that could cause a person to feel short of breath at rest or with exertion.  Was it difficult to inhale?  exhale?  Did you have any other symptoms (like coughing, a fever, etc)?  The bottom line is this....it could be asthma, or it could also be another respiratory problem.  You need to be evaluated by your physician.  Tell him/her exactly how you felt and what you were doing at the time.  They will likely order a series of tests that will help determine what the issue might be.  If, by chance, it turns out to be asthma it is very treatable, but it requires daily use of various medications.  Which medications are used depends on a lot of things, and your doc will determine which ones will work best for YOU.  So, make arrangements to see your doctor, and tell them that you are concerned about asthma and would like to be evaluated for it.  Hope that helped....good luck.|`|kTDobubBaa	You might have a chest cold.<br>  <br>  That happened to me one time during a basketball one of my basketball games, but go to the doctor and tell them your symptoms and they will take you to the hospital to have some breathing test.

These fats control your good and bad cholesterol levels and are heart healthy.  I've read that three tablespoons a day should be the limit.<br>  <br>  There's a Peanut Butter that's actually pretty good called BETTER THAN PEANUT BUTTER, which you can get at any Walgreens Store.  It's somewhat pricey ($4.29) here in Nashville, but you get the following per tablespoon:  50 calories, 1 g fat.  <br>  <br>  If you don't like the taste of Better Than Peanut Butter,  You can mix a little of it with regular or reduced fat peanut butter to cut calories and fat.

If you are talking actual body fat, you can really only lose 1 to 2 pounds in one week. <br>  What I would do is focus on reducing bloating and just eat healthy and exercise every day during this one week, and keep going after that. <br>  To make your stomach and the glands on your face smaller, dont eat any salt, don't eat much bread or bad carbs. Salt causes waster retention and make your stomach bloated and you wont digest as easily. Eat mainly vegetables, some fruit, proteins, no sugar and low fats obviously. <br>  Exercise every day, do some sit ups, drink ALOT of water. and i mean ALOT. this will flush out food, toxins, salt, and waste from your body. oh and FIBER. Eat tons and tons of fiber. Eat tons of vegetable, some cooked, some raw, eat some whole grains. I know this sounds gross, but you know when you have a big poo and your stomach looks thinner afterwards? well thats cause of fiber. <br>  So to summarzie:<br>  <br>  DO's:<br>  Vegetables<br>  Water<br>  Fiber<br>  Protein<br>  Exercise - cardio and situps<br>  <br>  Don'ts:<br>  Salt<br>  Sugar<br>  Fat<br>  Bad carbs: white bread, white flour, too much of any kind of bread or yeast|`|baAWBgXVaa	eat nothing excersize like crazy

Io0ItVDPaa	This seems like a good calorie line up, but there are many factors affecting how many calories you need. These factors include height, weight and activity level. So with just this information, it's hard to assess this diet.<br>  <br>  Remember, there's more to pay attention to then calories. Make sure that what you eat doesn't have too much fat, but also when you are eating fat try eat good fats instead of saturated fat and trans fat. <br>  <br>  Exercise is also very important. I would recommend weight lifting and cardiovascular exercise. Weight lifting speeds up your metabolism.

IKakoOfyaa	Try eating a banana or peach every day.  Both contain potassium (lack of potassium often causes charley horses).  If the problem persists in spite of that, see your doctor.  You'll need to have an exam and some blood work done to figure out why this is happening.<br>  <br>  For the pain, try a heating pad or warm compress and gently massaging the cramped area.|`|AA10450066	A "charley horse" is just an old name for muscle cramp. Cramps are usually caused by trying to use a muscle that isn't stretched out enough  to do what you want it to.They can also be caused by certain vitamin deficiency's.Since these 2 came in the morning then your major muscles might not have been fully "awake".When you first wake up try sitting on the bed putting your legs straight out with the heels on the floor and point your toes towards the walls of your room and then up toward the ceiling,so it stretches the muscles that run from your thigh all the way down the back of your legs a couple of times.This should "wake" the muscles up so they don't cramp.Hope this helps,good luck.|`|ca2539c525ddc6c1e54324614f643771aa	I used to get them when I was pregnant and I started rubbing my legs with Rubbing Alcohol before I went to bed and I didn't get them anymore.

63PY6dy4aa	We had this discussion in surgery the other day.  The surgeon indicated he "would be out of a job if healthcare is nationalized".  I don't believe we'll be out of jobs BUT I do believe that we will have salary caps just like every other government job.  I'm against it being nationalized also, mainly because I don't want the government to decide what treatment I or anyone I love can receive.  We hear alot about Canada's healthcare system but I have 2 online friends that live in Canada (one with cancer, the other needed a hip replacement).  The Canadian government would not "allow" either of them to be treated because #1 would not have a good chance of survival even with treatment & #2 would not live long enough, according to mortality tables, to receive benefit of a hip replacement long enough to pay for it.  In both cases, these women managed to raise the money to come to the USA for treatment.

enV0kWJxaa	You want exercises that create long muscles. Look at swimmers, gymnists, walkers, runners, bike riders.<br>  <br>  If by "plie" you mean pilates - that's a very good kind of exercise, low impact (means you won't injure yourself), stretches (prevents injury, increases flexibility, and keeps you from getting sore) and creates long muscles. It's a little tricky to learn, but once you got it, its a real fast, good all over exercise. Personally, pilates toned me up all over better than any exercise I've done. I do 20 minutes every other day.<br>  <br>  Weight lifting, for example, creates short, thick muscles. Just look at body builders. It also increases your appetite.<br>  <br>  Wouldn't recommend a diet - best way to control your appetite and weight is to walk 30-45 minutes 5 or 6 days a week. If you don't like walking, look for a "low" aerobic activity, maybe swimming, bike riding. Low aerobic means you are a little winded during the activity, but can still carry on a conversation. If you are grasping for air, you've gone beyond low aerobic, which increases your appetite.<br>  <br>  What ever exercise you do, get good instruction. Most of us don't have athletic training. I've hurt myself bad doing random exercises I've seen on tv.<br>  <br>  Also, it doesn't matter what you do if you don't enjoy it - because you will eventually quit doing it. So find something you really like, then it's easy!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Who's body looks better, a long distance runner or a sprinter? A sprinter in my opinion.

(FAT!!!!!!!!!!!!) is about 70% dieting & 30% exercise. So, what i recommend is filling up on fruits, vegetables, lean meats and nuts. Count your calories, keep it in the 1200-1500 range for best results.<br>  <br>  Since your interested in not bulking up, don't eat so much meat, but rather vegetables because it's mostly fiber & water, with lots of vitamins.

That way you can be assured that you are focusing on the endurance part of the muscle fibers and you will not get bulky.  Other than that, focus on your cardiovascular training.

I suggest a breakfast of granola, egg whites and fruits. Try to keep light with vegetables thorought the day and some lean protein (lean cuts of chicken and fish with fat taken off) at dinner with vegetables<br>  Eat every few hours to keep your metabolism revved up!<br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise is important as well. I am imagining you go to the gym, so try instead of heavy weights to use lighter weights. Try walking for 10-20 minutes, and running for a few minutes, making your heart rate go up in spurts, great at toning and burning fat. <br>  Running is great however! <br>  Rather than one long workout, try several smaller intervals during the day to keep your metabolism revved up!|`|jgwRBCLvaa	Unfortunately we can not choose where we gain or lose weight.  I am very big in my mid-area but not in the lower legs or upper body.  Diet and exercise is all we can do. At lest that what my personal trainer tells me :)There is not one exercise you should or shouldn't do to help in your thighs.  They only thing I can recommend is not working out the outter thigh, only the inner.

Anesthetics depress cardiac function, and it's easy for things to go horribly wrong.

The other thing you can buy is vaseline gauze which can be applied after the soaks, and between the two, you should be looking good soon enough.|`|B2w5MwjXaa	you cannot really stop it!  but there is stuff to take it off.  u can use scrubs like appricot scrubs but that will probably kill your face.  most malls have a kiosk(the little stand) with this company that sells sea salts and nail files and stuff.  well they ahve this AMAZING stuff that will make ur face peel and it does not hurt at all, its like rubbing lotion on your face.  you should get some and use it the day of or the day before the dance, it does not leave marks.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Long distance running, cross country skiing, and a healthy diet. Very cliché but it is the best and ONLY permanent solution for losing weight and achieving better health.|`|fwpu4jL3aa	You can lose a lot of weight just by changing the way that you eat. <br>  One of the easiest ways to lose weight is to eat less food but more often. The way I do this is to divide my daily calorie maximum by six. Here’s an example.<br>  <br>  Let’s say that I want to lose weight by eating only 1200 calories per day.

51jR2Lmlaa	If you are seriously addicted you need to get clean NOW! You are a kid so your body can handle cold turkey. Addictions developed as a kid are the worst, your body and mind literally develop around the drug and the addiction quite literally becomes embedded into yourself. I hate to say this but if you are unable to get clean, a healthiER alternative is marijuana. Eating marijuana produces effects like hydrocodone (and other opiates). I sedates you, and gives you that "warm" feeling. Because most of the harm from marijuana comes from inhaling the hot, dirty smoke, eating it greatly reduces this harm. The proper way is to extract the THC in butter, and consume the butter. This eliminates many harmful chemicals and your lungs are unaffected.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, marijuana is illegal and still unhealthy, however is is "less illegal" and "healthier" than hydro. Less illegal means it is decriminalized in a lot of states and having a little bit is a misdemeanour and often you can be nice to the cops and be let off with a warning.<br>  <br>  So health wise, cold turkey is the best and its 100% legal. If you need help, marijuana is the best alternative drug although it is still unhealthy and illegal.
AA11785060	Normal. Dudes get turned on by other dudes, just the nature of the beast. Of course females turn us on too, but that attraction is usually more when they are around you and you can smell and feel and touch and talk to them.  With other guys, it is a visual thing, and most guys will get erections seeing porn, and just seeing a guy aroused will arouse most guys.

JEXiKUmGaa	I personally have used Dermatend, and have had great results with it. It has removed 6 moles from my body, without any complications or pain. The first mole I tried it on was gone after 5 days of using the product, the other moles I removed took no longer than 10 days total time.<br>  <br>  Natural mole removal was a better option for me than surgery, especially since I was quoted several hundred dollars to remove my moles. Not only that the dermatologist said they couldn't guarantee my moles won't grow back, so they wanted me to spend hundreds but with no guarantees.<br>  <br>  Dermatend comes with a 100% guarantee, so if it doesn't work all you do is send it back. That was a big factor in me buying it, plus it contains only natural ingredients so that helped too.<br>  <br>  I ended up buying Dermatend from <a href="http://www.mole-wartremoval.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mole-wartremoval.com</a> which is a web store powered by amazon.com, making my purchase from such a well known website made me feel more secure personally.
T7gf3v5kaa	A cold sore and HSV-1 are the same thing. 90% of american have herpes simplex virus 1. HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus 2) and HSV-1 are the same virus.

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	There could be several explanations for your dizzy spell.  Did you eat breakfast and lunch?  Did you take medicine for the cramps?  What position did you fall asleep in and did you jump up quickly after you woke up?  Not eating could have caused a drop in your blood sugar, that left you drowsy and without fuel to meet body demands.  Some medications can make you drowsy as well.  Standing up and moving too quickly can cause a drop in blood pressure as well.  Fortunately, those things are all temporary situations, and you don't sound as if there is anything more sinister going on.  For right now, there isn't much for a doctor to do for you except wait and watch- which you can do just as well yourself.  If you aren't eating decently, it's a good time to start.  Brains and growing bodies need adequate nutrition, especially if you expect them to work properly.  Get adequate amounts of sleep, so you aren't dropping off during school hours.  Don't go hopping up out of the seat and rushing off with quite as much gusto, take your time to allow the body to adjust from going from the seated position to a standing and moving one.  And meantime relax and don't worry about one off episode of dizziness.  Weird things do just happen and you never do figure out exactly what the reason was.  It still doesn't mean it's anything serious.  Most of what goes wrong with us is actually pretty simple and the body is well equipped to handle it all.  If it continues to happen, then it's time to see the doctor.  Meantime, eat well and sleep enough.  Drink plenty, and slow down your pace.

And if you still feel hungry, have some fruit or more veggies.|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Sounds like your eating foods that are the wrong colour. If you change your whites to browns you won't be so gassy and eating foods with a low GI index will mean they burn off slower and make you feel fuller for longer. Try eating brown breads with lots of grains (like 9 grains) and having brown rice instead of white, also brown pasta. All of these foods are healthy and good for you and you won't gain weight.

RP2QQXbjaa	My questions is first: where did you find that research?  <br>  <br>  Fasting can sometimes be beneficial but I don't know if every other day is good for you... <br>  I'm not sure what kind of digestive problems you have, so I don't really have suggestions for you. You should probably talk to your doctor about what would be best for you.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes caffeine can be disruptive for the GI system (increase motility as well as irritation) so I'm not sure if that's the best strategy.|`|tIFXgawmaa	This diet will make you fatter. I used to be fat too and tried all kinds of diet to lose weight, but once you quit your diet, you gain double the fat before you started your diet, within 1 week. Most likely you will quit your diet.|`|0q4quk8raa	Settings yourself this goal is not realistic, you will get very very hungry, and possibly unwell. This may cause you to binge eat on your good days and because you dont have the energy to work it off the next day, it will just turn to fat. Dont bother.<br>  So answering this question is pointless.|`|6ANShrAWaa	i know you dont want to hear this but eating everyother day= storing everything as fat everytime you do eat and not using fat as an energy source= increase in body fat. are you asking if coffee is bad for you? just dont have too many cups in any day.|`|1wwkc5W5aa	Yeah, caffeine speeds up your metabolism.

But how you skip meals, and the amount you eat at your next meal, can affect your overall health.<br>  <br>  The scientific data on skipping meals has been confusing. In some studies, fasting has resulted in measurable metabolic benefits for obese people, and in animal studies, intermittent feeding and fasting reduces the incidence of diabetes and improves certain indicators of cardiovascular health. Even so, several observational studies and short-term experiments have suggested an association between meal skipping and poor health.<br>  <br>  In recent months, two new studies may help explain how skipping meals affects health.<br>  <br>  The most recent study, published this month in the medical journal Metabolism, looked at what happens when people skip meals but end up eating just as much as they would in a normal day when they finally do sit down to a meal. The study, conducted by diabetes researchers at the National Institute on Aging, involved healthy, normal-weight men and women in their 40s. For two months, the study subjects ate three meals a day. For another eight-week period, they skipped two meals but ate the same number of calories in one evening meal, consumed between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. <br>  <br>  The researchers found that skipping meals during the day and eating one large meal in the evening resulted in potentially risky metabolic changes. The meal skippers had elevated fasting glucose levels and a delayed insulin response — conditions that, if they persisted long term, could lead to diabetes.<br>  <br>  The study was notable because it followed another study earlier this year that found that skipping meals every other day could actually improve a patient’s health. In that study, published in March in Free Radical Biology & Medicine, overweight adults with mild asthma ate normal meals one day. This was followed by a day of severely restricted eating, when they ate less than 20 percent of their normal caloric intake, or about 400 or 500 calories a day — the equivalent of about one meal. Nine out of 10 study participants were able to stick to the eating plan. <br>  <br>  After following the alternate-day dieting pattern for two months, the dieters lost an average of 8 percent of their body weight, and their asthma-related symptoms also improved. They had lower cholesterol and triglycerides, “striking” reductions in markers of oxidative stress and increased levels of the antioxidant uric acid. Markers of inflammation were also significantly lower.<br>  <br>  The conclusion, say the authors of the more recent meal-skipping study, is that skipping meals as part of a controlled eating plan that results in lower calorie intake can result in better health. However, skipping meals during the day and then overeating at the evening meal results in harmful metabolic changes in the body.

IMPvzBk1aa	You have accumulated fluid in the middle ear.  Sometimes when you blow your nose too hard, the eustachian tube opens and allows masal discharge to pass through it into the middle ear, which is a cavity behind your eardrum.  <br>  You can try Valsalva maneuver to help it drain back through the eustachian tube and out of your middle ear.  Pinch your nose, close your mouth and throat, and try to "pop" your ears.  This opens the tubes and helps the fluid drain.  You can also use decongestants if it is bothering you quite a bit, although using them sometimes prolongs the cold symptoms so I wouldn't use them unless you need them in order to function.|`|dksB1B0Laa	Oh that is common in some people<br>  There is this one type of oil stuff that you put in your ear and it's supposed to help|`|g4L0RML5aa	u probably have a sinus infection. either go to a doctor to get medicine or let it go away by itself in a couple days. feel better|`|j04gpOKOaa	ear infection. you need an antibiotic like amoxicillin or something.

qKdj99OUaa	A good thing to start with is vegetables and fruits if you don't know how to cook. Taking pills may not always work as scientists are finding out, because your body may not accept them and just excrete them (so you are lucky in this case). If you don't know how to cook and you are trying to boost your immune system, don't go to fast food restaurants or anything like that. When my immune system was down, I usually ate a lot of lemons for the natural Vitamin C. Green vegetables are always good. Eggs are good, if you don't know how to boil them, you can look it up.

At about the level of the elbow, the brachial artery divides into two terminal branches, the radial and ulnar arteries, the radial passing downward on the distal (thumb) side of the forearm, the ulnar on the medial side.<br>  <br>  The radial artery seems to be the continuation of the brachial, but it is smaller in caliber than the ulnar. It commences at the bifurcation of the brachial, just below the bend of the elbow, and passes along the radial side of the forearm to the wrist. It then winds backward, around the lateral side of the carpus, beneath the tendons of the Abductor pollicis longus and Extensores pollicis longus and brevis to the upper end of the space between the metacarpal bones of the thumb and index finger. Finally it passes forward between the two heads of the first Interosseous dorsalis, into the palm of the hand, where it crosses the metacarpal bones and at the ulnar side of the hand unites with the deep volar branch of the ulnar artery to form the deep volar arch. <br>  <br>  The radial artery therefore consists of three portions, one in the forearm, a second at the back of the wrist, and a third in the hand.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take care as always!

FJpPCVTCaa	over-sleeping maybe. maybe you need to get a hobby that excites you, something that's worth waking up to in the morning. also drinking water before you go to sleep, having fruit and water next to your bed stand for when you wake up so you'll have some wake up food close by to jump start your morning.|`|icbRyY6Jaa	uqh...<br>  idk!|`|jsUE73TXaa	Because you were asleep, perhaps?  I mean, just a guess.  Some people take longer to wake up and hence feel tired for up to even 2 hours after waking up.

1kbxpK4caa	Not immediately. Think of it like alcoholics, the first drink doesn't make you addicted. It's a quicker addiction in comparison to alcohol but what makes someone addicted is the mental and physical stimulus that is irresistible. <br>  To answer your second question.<br>  Bulimics don't loose weight long term. In the very beginning weight will come off pretty fast. BUT a common misconception is that you will lose weight. You don't. When your body misses the actual weight of food, or the nutrients. But when someone is bulimic all the calories of the food they ingest is instantly absorbed. So bulimics rarely look super thin, that makes the disease even harder to detect in individuals.|`|b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	Immediately. You start thinking "well, it's okay to do it now. it's not like i'm gunna do it everyday".<br>  <br>  There are MANY risks with bulimia, I don't reccommend it at all. The stomach acid will start to burn your throat causing all kinds of problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bulimics are often normal sized people. If you don't puke immediately, a lot is already being absorbed.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to lose weight then cut what you eat. If you'd normally have 2 pieces of bread, have 1. Instead of a full bowl of cereal, eat half a bowl.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck :)

You will want to go through a bulking phase before a cutting phase. Heavy weights with minimal cardio, plenty of carbs and protein followed by the cutting phase which is moderate weights followed by moderate cardio, moderate carbs and protein.|`|KzbZH4T5aa	it happens at the same time|`|46a6b68c5f412fe8745faef1771ea9d8aa	Adding muscle is easier when you are heavier because of the natural weight you have available to use when doing body weight exercise (including just walking around in day to day life) and losing fat is easier because heavier people use more calories to move. In addition, muscle consumes calories.<br>  <br>  Trying to lose fat first can make you lose muscle, but adding muscle first may help you lose fat.<br>  <br>  BMI can be misleading, especially if one loses fat and gains muscle.<br>  <br>  You need cardio for health, fairly intense to be as beneficial as possible, and weights. If you are new, weight machines are easier and safer. You can have a trainer suggest a weight routine and a cardio routine. Just make sure the intensity is there. Work up to at least 70%  max heart rate for 20-30 minutes 3X day for cardio health, and try to increase intensity, duration (for cardio) and reps (for weights) each week when possible. If you start having trouble sleeping, catch a cold, get unusually sore, etc, you might be overtraining and need to take it down a notch.<br>  <br>  It might be a good idea to have a checkup first. Just be aware, many doctors are clueless when it comes to exercise. They can give you the all clear, but might not be able to give advice beyond that. If you are given restrictions, get a 2nd opinion.|`|EVs8bXEtaa	With every pound of muscle on your body you burn an extra amount of calories a day. I'm unsure how many but I've heard anywhere from 6 but most sources claim between 30-50!<br>  <br>  Don't expect to see instant results on the scale if you're trying to build muscle and lose weight. You really need to change your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  You will build muscle much faster having extra fat on your body. Skinny people have a much more difficult time(even with proper diet) because their body will actually burn their muscle rather than their fat.<br>  <br>  Before starting anykind of workout, I must recommend going to your local healthfood store or GNC (if you mind spending the extra money on name brand products) and buy at there very minimum Protien, Creatine and a Multivitamin. <br>  <br>  I would work out your upper body every other day and your lower body between those days.<br>  <br>  On my upper body days I do bicep curls/tricep curls, wrist curls, military press, butterflies, flat bench press and bent rows. <br>  <br>  On my lower body days I run on the beach or treadmill for 30 minutes, do 5 sets of 100 jump ropes, Squat Jumps(idk the exact name for these but you start in a squat-like stance and then jump as high as you can, then repeat). Then I do crunches.<br>  <br>  About an 30 minutes to an hour before your workout eat something with carbs, will give you a lot of energy, then spend atleast 3 minutes stretching/warming up. About an hour after working out drink a protien shake. <br>  <br>  I do this every day and I'm in great physical shape. I also try to have fun by playing football or basketball with buddies or just play racquetball by myself. You must try to find some *fun* activities or you're destined to fail. You want to change your body? You gotta change your lifestyle first.<br>  <br>  Anyways, this is just what I would recommend because it works for me!
zKM9P2kYaa	as you gain more muscle you will lose fat|`|Tm9kA5umaa	u should be gaining mucsle while u burn fat|`|7YmBMJRuaa	well u shud burn fat as u gain muscle right?|`|ENwX0vtJaa	Im 24 and been working out for about a year now.. I have a tall slim build and was always very thin. I weighed 120 at 5'11 for a long time now I weigh 150 and have more fullness and muscle. It was explained to me since I was very thin that I should eat 3000+ healthy calories a day. Here's my routine.. 15-25 mins of cardio (on days I work out) this is to boost my heart rate and everything you do afterwords will both burn excess fat and build muscle faster. I do 3 sets of 10 or 12 on each bench (incline, decline, and flat) 3 times in one work out (90 reps total) I use free wights rather than bars so that it works the muscles in all direction of the arm and chest. I also take supplements. I suggest No-Explode from BSN (www.bodybuilding.com) and Nitrix. These together will show you satisfying results very quickly. Although No-Explode alone will give you endurance, and strength you wouldn't imagine you have.|`|LklBuVAXaa	So really you want to lose about 10 lbs right.  25-30 (healthy BMI) minus 15-20 (muscle gain) equals about 10 lbs of total weight loss.<br>  <br>  Muscle burns fat....fat does not grow muscle.  Gaining muscle will increase your metabolism and burn fat more effectively.  So your focus should be on gaining muscle first and using cardio to sculpt.<br>  <br>  I would use a four day split as follows: <br>  <br>  Monday:  Back and Bi's<br>  Tuesday:  Chest and Tri's<br>  Thursday:  Legs<br>  Friday:  Shoulders and Abs.<br>  <br>  *12-15 sets per body part each week.  Adjust as needed...may need to go up to 15-20 sets a week per body part.<br>  <br>  20 minutes of cardio each workout day.  Anything more than 20 you start to burn more muscle than fat.  The goal is to burn more calories than you take in.  So if you eat 2500 calories a day then you need to burn 2501 or more to lose weight.|`|fPoDxJL9aa	First off if you weigh 6'3 and weigh 215 you do not need to weigh 190 to be healthy.  The BMI chart is known to be a joke.  If you are 6'3 and 180 you are quite skinny.  For the working out, if your not on steroids than you will want to put on the muscle first.  Anyone who has put on 20 pounds of muscle(without roids) in a few months knows that a little fat will come with it.  Losing the fat then putting on the muscle will make so you have to lose fat when your done putting on the muscle so it will take way longer.  You should bulk up and actually put on more fat with the muscle to speed up the muscle building.<br>  When searching the internet for workouts look at mass workouts and for diets look at bulking diets.  They will gains you muscle the fastest.<br>  I can suggest some supplements for you<br>  when you start your heavy lifting take these<br>  -a mutli vitamin for general health<br>  -a glucosamine supplement for joints b/c heavy lifting will cause joint stress<br>  -fish oil for joint and heart health<br>  -a good whey protein, i suggest ON whey gold standard (take it 15 mins after workout w/ water)<br>  those are the basic supplements every lifter should take<br>  Thats a good start for you|`|pvjZEIDRaa	I'm pretty sure you need fat to gain muscle. Fat turns to muscle, just like muscle turns to fat if you don't keep up what you're doing. So don't lose the fat first...work on muscles then move on to fat if you're not happy with the changes.|`|SwdLT0yvaa	yes you should do that first as well and exersize too.

8H9JHVZeaa	ok, first of all will you be getting insurance by yourself or through your employer?  Someone said Aetna....well let me tell you, each insurance may be as good as Aetna or better, or as crapy depending on premiums you pay.  Lower premiums you pay, worse benefits you receive.  There might be 100 people with Aetna but each of them will have different benefits.<br>    If you decide to get insurance by yourself and you pay low premium your insurance will barely pay anything.<br>  Now as it comes to dental insurances their yearly maximums range between 1000-1500 on average, unless you pay good premiums your annual max. may be higher-but not likely.  Ortho is paid at 50% up to your allowable amount.  but before you sign up with any of the insurances ask what is age limit for ortho and is there any waiting period, b/c if there is waiting period of 12 months on ortho it means they wont pay for next 12 months.......so...ask questions....make sure it;s PPO b/c most denstist take PPO, HMO almost noone accepts.<br>  <br>  now one more thing...I dont know where you live but $3800 is good for braces, in IL in my area braces range between 4700-6000.....so also dont settle for cheapest, schedule many consultations, they are free and you get to see what do they offer; are they professional, how does the treatment look like, and most offer payment plans!

A psychiatrist is necessary to ensure that you're not).<br>  If the psychiatrist is in agreement, he will refer you to a Gender Specialist, who will then (assuming he agrees that you are transsexual)  co-ordinate your treatment; after a period of time, you may be prescribed hormone therapy, and after that, you can start thinking about surgery; Your Gender Specialist will be able to advise you which surgeons are available to you. <br>  It's a long, painful and expensive process; you will need to be very sure, and mentally very strong, to complete it, and you will face a lot of prejudice, ignorance and plain ol' hate along the way.<br>  <br>  If you are considering this route, it's usually best to tell your family as soon as is practical; having family and friends to support you makes the process a lot easier (although many transpeople have to, and do, manage without).<br>  <br>  No, it's not possible to get a uterus transplant; medical science is not able to do that yet, and almost certainly won't be for some time.

If you have a 24.5 inch waist you're lucky and you should be happy with that.<br>  I guess if i saw a picture I might think you have a couple pounds to lose but that's it at the most. <br>  <br>  Don't do this crazy calorie counting thing!! and also if you're rounding up 250 to 300 thats a bit extreme dont you think? I can understand rounding up to like 270 or something to be safe but 50 whole calories thats alot to round up to. <br>  Focus on eating about 1700-2000 calories a day, but don't go crazy counting! Just write down everything you eat and think of what the estimate is before you eat it. Focus on trying to eat three balanced meals a day with lots of fruits and veggies. Drink lots of water, keep doing your exercising, you already seem to have that down. ANd you'll be fine. You must already be thin, but if you have a couple pounds to lose just eat healthy and keep exercising. You are not fat, and this whole calorie counting thing will eventually drive you insane. <br>  Eat three small meals a day, and have healthy snakcs when you're hungry like : apple slices, cucumber slices, snow peas, nuts, berries.<br>  Seriously, you dont need to lose much weight, and stop calorie counting so exact. just be aware of what you're eating.

68Q2WzC1aa	My second MS symptom (10 yrs ago) was Optic Neuritis...I went completely blind in my left eye for two weeks but my sight started to recover on the third week and came back to 95% normal again...I've never had ON again but used to get blurred vision every week for about two hours maybe twice a week....Then I transformed my diet....never had blurred vision again.<br>  <br>  So no it shouldn't cause permanent blindness but every case is different.|`|1dcfd1cbe002b5b4354aea9bd5db367eaa	Multiple Sclerosis is a very individual disease; one person's MS is completely different from anyone else's MS.  That said, MS rarely causes someone to go completely blind.<br>  <br>  The most common vision issue associated with MS is optic neuritis.  This is a condition caused by the swelling of the optic nerve behind the eyeball (it is also called retrobulbar optic neuritis; retrobulbar meaning "behind the eyeball").  Symptoms of ON include pain when moving the eye, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, or temporary blindness in one eye.  Most folks who develop ON recover nearly completely within weeks, sometimes months.  Some doctors administer steroids because it may speed up the recovery process.<br>  <br>  Other vision symptoms include diplopia (double vision) and nystagmus (jumping vision), but both are usually mild and usually correct themselves.

Go to a drug store and buy some AZO (its usually near the pads and tampons) and take as directed.  Don't freak out, it will turn your urine bright orange or red.  This is normal!!  AZO is a urinary antiseptic, so it will numb your bladder and urethra, which will make going to the bathroom much less painful, and you shouldn't always feel like you have to go.  Then as soon as you can, make an appt with your doctor.  They will have you give a urine sample and will test it for infection.  Then, if you do have a UTI, they will give you antibiotics and you will be better soon.

You can't solely rely on your diet to make you happy, though, you have to combine it with other coping methods. It sounds like you're getting plenty of fibre and protein and the like, but try adding apples and pears and the link, and maybe some uncooked vegetables as well. Drink juice, milk and water instead of those sugary drinks (juice is sugary too, I will admit, but it makes me feel far better than soda does) and get exercise outside when you can.|`|ParFJxnSaa	You may well be suffering from depression, or Seasonal Affective Disorder***. Eat cold water fish; salmon, mackeral, or tuna, 3 times weekly; alternate, & see www.radiantrecovery.com & www.mercola.com SEARCHBAR: "nutritional type". Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes of exercise, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly in daytime, outside. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, (a free E course in it is at: <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a> ) or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).
OPgXRcVvaa	You should ask a doctor, they will no just what to do.<br>  but yeah you should do the aroma therapy oil.<br>  But dont let it get to serious, do something soon.:)<br>  -Nicole<br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	yeah that's what you should get aroma therapy oil|`|8dd7cbab7afa25c36b4fc14aa85bcec3aa	If none of the things that you have tried worked, you may have a sinus infection.  You have two options if that is the case.  Go to the doctor and get some antibiotics or wait it out and it may go away.  Or waiting may just make it much worse and you would need to see the doctor anyway.  In my opinion (I'm a nurse) it sounds like an infection.  If you can, go to the doctor.  Hope you feel better.

JGOeJOFDaa	You're supposed to eat all of your daily allotted points.  If you eat less, your body goes into starvation mode and you have a lot more trouble losing weight.  <br>  <br>  Also, your weight fluctuates day to day, even hour to hour.  This is why it's a good idea to only weigh yourself once a week and generally around the same time.  For example, if you try weighing yourself as soon as you wake up, again in the middle of the afternoon, and then once again at night. You will get a different number each time, though it will be around the same range.|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	As jen said above, you need to consume all of your daily points. The 35 weekly points are an option but the daily points all need to be used. Since you are just starting off, I would refrain from weighing yourself other than at the weekly meetings so that you can see your whole weeks worth of progress. If you are sticking to the program, there is no need to keep weighing yourself.|`|Ztp4BMI4aa	Well weight watchers can be confusing.  But that is great that you lost 4 pounds.  Anyways some food tends to have more carbs than others<br>  Example:<br>  one can of soup could have 0 points in it but could have more carbs than a strawberry short cake which has 4 points.  So don't just think about the points, read the labels too

pNmCYpnqaa	Exercise about 3 times a week.  Tone overall body muscle not just your abs.  Try to run at least two times a week on days you don't workout.  Also drink about 16 ounces of water right when you wake up to stimulate your metabolism and eat healthy.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|gwindStOaa	none... your body will go into starvation mode and keep everything that goes in.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	I agree with what the girl above me said. Try another thousand calories a day. And to be healthy, use up all your calories with fruits, meats, and vegetables. NOT junk food. And hun, you're already skinny. How much are you expecting to lose...|`|pVJkHsvKaa	well, at that height and weight, u shudnt try to lose weight. u will go into a mode that makes u only eat 500 cal per day for a week, or less! its dangerous. come on, ur 18, you should watch what u eat, like not more than 4 fast food meals a week (common sense), but u shudnt stop yourself from eating to lose weight. you can get into trouble for eating less. just eat right, and work out about 3 times a week. u will lose weight, and be healthy.
I8lFqyyFaa	Yes.  You don't actually have a real period on birth control, since on the birth control hormones, your uterine lining doesn't thicken.  What you have during the 7 days you are taking the non-hormone pills is withdrawal bleeding.  A substitute period, as it were.  Your hormones drop that week so the uterus lining weakens and bleeds in response.  Because you don't have that thickened lining in your uterus, the bleeding will be substantially less then an actual period you have while not taking birth control pills.  You might bleed 1/3 of what your regular period looks like.  Obviously, on the pill this comes at a precise time of hormonal withdraw every month.  And because there's less bleeding and no thickened lining, there's also a lot less cramping for most women too.  You may experience some effects from the hormonal withdraw in relation to your mood - like PMS - but because it isn't your normal cycle of hormones, any other PMS types of things you might usually have your cycle would be lessened, if not gone too.|`|VUEvviKzaa	it effected my period. my pain and discomfort went away but my period didn't lessen in days.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	yes maam.|`|dVUcAD6zaa	I don't know in what way you are asking in which it affects.<br>  But, it made mine lighter and shorter.<br>  <br>  It's better for me because now I know when I'm gonna have it, when before it would literally come at random each month.|`|AA11283573	I've always heard that it makes your periods lighter and that it helps make cramping less severe or something.<br>  These are just things I heard about from some people.
muHctmaGaa	No, it's not necessarily a sign of pregnancy, as cravings often have to do with poor nutrition.

SZgOodf1aa	Well, constipation isn't normally associated with antibiotic use..usually it's exactly the opposite (i.e. diarrhea).  Anyway, the first thing to do is to increase your fluid intake (lots of water), and start eating high fiber foods (apples, etc). Doing some light exercise can often help too, believe it or not.  Also, you can buy Dulcolax tablets over the counter, and it usually does a pretty good job at relieving constipation.  Just follow the directions given on the bottle.The other thing that you could do is to buy what is known as a Fleet's enema over the counter and administer it according to the instructions given by the manufacturer.  I'll tell you that, if you choose to use that method, you will probably have a bit of an upset stomach after you have your bowel movement. DON'T use the enema and the Dulcolax at the same time, either.  I'd start off with the Dulcolax and see how that works for you.  If you haven't had a bowel movement by tomorrow, then try the Fleet's (but only use one of those please!).  If you still have trouble, then it is time to see your doctor.    Hope that helps.
354ee70c2c4423a17f2d4f038d00cafbaa	OK. I'm going to assume that you have a viral infection which is causing your throat to be sore, but upon reading more about the coughing and the blood in the mucus (I'm sure it's probably yellow) may suggest that you have both a viral sinus infection and sore throat. <br>  <br>  Traces of blood in the mucus isn't as serious as people make it out to be. It just means that your sinus' are dry. I would recommend the use of a humidifier for the sinus' it'll help you breathe and keep the sinus' moist. It will also help you expel any matter in your lungs by causing it to become loose.<br>  <br>  If you want to take something:<br>  <br>  Mucinex. T<br>  Tylenol for the pain.<br>  Vitamin-C<br>  <br>  This is purely advice. I would recommend seeing a trained professional in matters such as this just in case it turns out to be something worse than what's been mentioned above.|`|yNEkgQaFaa	Rule of Thumb: You feel really sick and it lasts more then 2 weeks, you should probably go to the Doctor.

AA11168446	A variety of workouts is best.

Good luck|`|4b8MLoJNaa	Whenever you are concerned about athletic performance you need to focus both your diet and your workouts. I agree with the others who have answered saying that you need  variation in your workouts. Doing only push-ups and sit-ups are not going to help you perform at your best, although they are both excellent components in any workout. I would suggest checking out www.crossfit.com. They offer free daily workouts that often require minimal equipment (mostly just your body and a place to do pull-ups.) If you stick to workouts like these and eat properly, you will see increased performance, especailly in a sport like football, and all of the aesthetic improvements that go along with that. Plus you won't have to worry about your balls getting messed up.|`|ab9d0d9ad5f495e6629d6147a4ea8894aa	As far as a six pack, it will only show through if you lose your overall body fat (allowing your muscle to show through).  Since you cannot spot reduce fat, this is the only way to lose fat in your abs.  Crunches, sit ups, etc build muscle but they do not burn much fat at all and you need total body routines to do this.<br>  <br>  Pushups are a great exercise to build muscle but if you need to get stronger (especially for football and other sports) do not neglect your leg strength.  Mix in squats and lunges at least with your pushups.  That is a good start.<br>  <br>  For more information visit the blog below...Good luck :)|`|YQ13Mdq4aa	two weeks tops, if you got steroids.<br>  steroids can be your best friend.

If you need to lose maybe 5 or 10lbs it can happen. You won't get slim or tone abs by simply doing crunches you need to lose overall body fat. There is no such thing as spot reduction you can't lose fat only in your abdomen, thighs, arms etc. you have to burn overall fat and those areas will slim down at the same time. Running is one of the best ways to lose weight as well as swimming because they incorporate total body movement. Crunches will only increase the muscle size under the fat already in that area making your abs actually appear larger. Another good thing would be to try keeping a food journal and cutting out very fatty foods such as chips, white bread, white rice, etc. this will help drop pounds as well.
oD3DBOBfaa	Did your bites look like the picture on the site below? If so, you have bed bugs on the mattress......<br>  <br>  First of all, you have to wash all the bedding items with HOT water.

Mxq1NQJdaa	Yikes, that is a loaded question.  Can you be depressed but not feel depressed?  Doubtful.  Depression makes a person feel absolutely hopeless....nothing has any emotional value, you feel like 'why get up today, it's just going to be a messed up day', not caring if your teeth are brushed or your hair is combed.  My depression manifested in profound anger and impatience with others.<br>  <br>  I have overcome a lot of it by knowing it will pass.  I know it is worse in winter and look so forward to sunshine and warm days.  I have to practice looking for little events during the day that make me smile.  They don't necessarily make me happy, but they do make me smile if I let them.  I smile a lot when I watch animal behavior.....I don't think they get depressed.....they don't have the propensity.  It isn't within their realm of thought.  I get a kick out of watching people at the grocery cussing because they can't get the grocery carts separated.  I get a kick out of watching little babies throwing fits and their parents falling for it.  Oh my......so much to observe to make youself feel better.  Don't get me wrong.......I do not enjoy watching others fail, but do try to find humor in just about every situation rather than being too critical.  Try it......takes the focus off you......and maybe even provides you with a laugh throughout the day!!<br>  <br>  Today's thought:  Don't take yourself too seriuosly.........:)|`|UlNU2Iydaa	Sounds like you have low energy.<br>  <br>  Try purchasing a therapy light, replacing your yellow bulbs for natural light bulbs, and start excising regularly/watching how much junk, preservatives, and sugar you eat. <br>  <br>  If you hav seasonal effective disorder, then the bright lights should help a lot as the days get darker. The exercise will confront the other hypothesised cause of seasonal effective disorder by increasing your energy output to what it is in the summer, increasing your feel good chemicals, and lifting your mood. <br>  <br>  Watching what you eat is very important, because you are only as good as your ingredients. If you are eating tons of sugar, your energy levels will peak and fall frequently leading to mood swings. If you are filling your body with junk, you will not have energy and it will depress your mood. If you are eating foods with lots of preservatives, artificial sweeteners or otherwise unnatural toxins, you will feel like crap, and you will probably act the part as well. <br>  <br>  If you want this to improve you are going to need to make changes to maximise your chances for something to work. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best, and good luck!|`|W3dcQPvzaa	You can be depressed but not feel it. But wait a minute surely that must be wrong ! No ! <br>  I think you are confused as to what depression is my friend. Just because you're not ready for commiting suicide doesn't mean you aren't depressed. The symptoms very widely. Some people eat when they're depressed, some don't. Some eat lots, lots more (comfort eating). Some people go out , some don't. Some go out and get high.<br>  <br>  Depression can interfere with bodily functions - you may pee a lot more or pee a lot less. You might be able to read a book or may not be able to think straight.

The last time that I switched from a brand to a generic (opposite of what you are doing) was over 10 years ago from Desogen to Ortho-Cept (the generic of Desogen).<br>  <br>  However, it is true that some do find that generics don't work as well as brand name medications like with birth control pills.<br>  <br>  I am also including the link to a site that may help you find more information and experiences.

aRMsI01jaa	Everyone is different. I am 13 and got mine January this year. Most girls are around 9-15. You sound like it will be pretty soon. :D <br>  Your becoming a woman. Lol|`|y8HyP1bzaa	It sounds like you should be starting soon.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who is 18, and she's had her period for years, but she still doesn't have armpit hair either!  I'm not saying she is normal, because she is extraordinarily thin, but I guess that can happen for some people.|`|YMKAgH4Paa	No one can tell you exactly when. But you have the symptoms, so you could start anytime. :)|`|mtAqANKfaa	no one can tell you that, especially no one on here. Generally you don't expect your period to come, so not many people can remember the symptoms. All i remember is i was about twelve when i started mine, and then my best friend started a whole year later, and then my other friend didnt start until she was 15.|`|VUEvviKzaa	nobody knows when they will get there first period, my one aunt didn't get her first period until she was 25yrs old, so it just depends on your body, when it feels ready.|`|ED78Bre5aa	Depends on your body we all get it at different ages, I was only 10 when I got mine! =]

It can be a painful, embarrasing experience for anyone who contracts the virus.? Unfortunately, there is no medical cure and the medical treatments can be quite costly, even with good insurance.? While most people repsond well to antiviral medicines such as Zovirax and Valtrex, some of us need a little extra boost to prevent those awful outbreaks.? There are vitamins and minerals that occur in foods and natural topical solutions that can help.<br>   ?<br>   Vitamin C is found in high quantities is foods such as sweet red peppers, strawberries and oranges.? Vitamin C in important for the production of collagen, a fiber that makes skin cells stronger, more able to resist the blisters caused by the herpes virus.? It also aids in white blood cell activity, helping the immune system fight the virus.<br>   ?<br>   Zinc can be found in lean meats such as beef, pork, crab and turkey.? Zinc has been found to inhibit reproduction of the herpes virus.? It can also help the immune system identify and fight the virus.<br>   ?<br>   Foods that are high in arginine like nuts, tuna, salmon, shrimp and egg yolks should be avoided.? Arginine is necessary for the production of the HSV virus, so a diet high in arginine may actually trigger activation of the virus.? Arginine's natural enemy is Lysine.? Lysine has long been thought of as a great way to combat the production of the herpes virus because it blocks the production of Arginine.? Some foods that have a high Lysine/low Arginine ratio are yogurts and cheeses and lean white meats.<br>   ?<br>   Licorice is a natural antiviral and can help reduce the inflammation caused by an outbreak.? It can be dissolved in a hot tea for quick release in the body.<br>   ?<br>   Natural topical solutions include lemon balm and aloe vera.? Both can be placed directly on the herpes lesions and promote faster healing of and help reduce the pain of the outbreak.<br>   ?<br>   If you have frequent herpes outbreaks and antiviral medications don't seem to be helping, try incorporating some of the above foods into your diet for more natural relief.

aGYsSPGoaa	dont worry about tss change it ever 4 hours if your scared or if u pee within the four hours do it there it is easy and i know how teachers are just tell a women teacher that you are on it and they cant tell you no legally i find them easier and more discreet. tss doesnt happen very often it happends in 1 and ever like 1000 people dont sleep in them though unless you are willing to wake up every 6 hrs to change it|`|YMKAgH4Paa	Tampons are more reliable and even though they can be a little weird to put in at first, you will get used to it. The They are better &; its normal to be scared to use them your first time.  Try this article &; video -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperiod_inserttampon.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperio...</a>|`|VUEvviKzaa	yes they are easier. and don't really worry about TSS, you have ever 4 hours to change them.|`|HjuWG5sXaa	YES they are and dont even worry about the TSS thing you can really only get that if you leave it in there for like 2 days. The whole classs thing isnt a problem cause its alot faster to put a tampon in then use a pad. plus pads are gross and your basically sitting in your own blood. Dont worry you dont even feel it in there. i didnt even use pads once i started off as tampons cause im a germ freak and couldnt stand the thought.|`|1aJjFrUCaa	yeah tampons are a whole lot easier and not as NASTY AND YUCKY as pads. bc it's not just sitting in your pants lol.<br>  Tampons you dont have to change them as much as ppl say. I change mine like every 4-5 hours. if you have to change it like right before you go to school,during lunch, and once you get home! but if your on a heavy period you may have to change it more than that! but if it's a light period then wat i said is fine. you dont get TSS that easily! tamons are really easy! i love them. thank god for tampons lol. =]|`|UaOB9edEaa	Yes they are as easy as everyone is telling you. Just try them on the weekend when you have time. And see if you like them. I think I would hate my period if I didn't have tampons. They make life so much easier.|`|u8pdRkcZaa	Yes they are as easy as everyone is telling you.  You will love them once you start using them.  There is no need to worry about TSS, I have used them for a long time and have never even had symptoms of TSS.|`|5TAQgcrpaa	I hate tampons but theres nothing wrong with them<br>  im just like you the idea of it makes my stomach hurt<br>  <br>  Dont worry about changing it .. every 4 hours is fine and if yer teacher doesnt let you just let them know what the deal is and if they still dont let then just leave the class im sure yer mom will have a lot to say to yer school if theyre not letting you go to the bathroom esp. with an emergency.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Well, they are certainly more convenient and less noticable to carry around with you, and if you don't like feeling that "leaking" feeling you get with pads, they are easier in that sense. I, too, had issues with them when I was a teen & before I lost my virginity. My friend Claire used to freak out when she first tried using them too, so don't feel weird. I couldn't use them until after I lost my virginity because my opening was so small. But, below is a great article to soothe your fears about TSS.
ArFFUPTBaa	It's totally normal for healthy girls and women to have a kind of vaginal discharge that is known as leukorrhea. Usually, it is either thick and whitish or slippery and clear. Typical vaginal discharge may have a particular odor — and that's normal, too.<br>  <br>  Girls may notice a different kind of wetness when they become sexually aroused. When a woman is sexually excited, blood flows to the genitals and the vagina lubricates itself, causing wetness. This lubrication reduces unpleasant friction and makes penetration more comfortable.|`|T20lVPDkaa	its just natural discharge.. its happened to me too and i've read other womens opinions about and they said its normal. i wouldnt worry.|`|NhfPh215aa	well it could of been p****y  or it could of been discharge or somthing but you should see a doctor about this  hope i helped|`|yqjYafb9aa	discharge : D|`|17f8386a7ad448503bdc20feca29c092aa	..it's just discharge.<br>  i get that too sometimes.|`|ve21pKHgaa	it was discharge dont worry
QxIhMHwAaa	It is rarely a problem due unto itself....meaning that there's usually an underlying psychosocial issue such as anxiety, depression, or a body image disorder that leads the person to pulling their hair. <br>  <br>  Your friend really needs to talk to someone. If she told you about it, she's likely willing to talk to you more about it if you approach it in a way that you want to help her, not judge her. She seems to be receptive to getting some help since she's told you about it. Tell her that you are willing to help and support her. Suggest that she talk to an adult she's comfortable with or counselor at school about it. If she is open with you, ask if she wants you there for moral support since you seem to want to help her. Sometimes its easier if a person has moral support before opening up to someone else.<br>  <br>  It's difficult for people to open up about these things, and you seem like you are a good friend for wanting to help her.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	Trichotillomania is a type of compulsive behavior. Its causes are not clearly understood.<br>  <br>  It may affect as much as 4% of the population. Women are four times more likely to be affected than men.<br>  <br>  People with this disorder often will first seek the help of a doctor who treats skin problems (dermatologist).<br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Symptoms usually begin before the age of 17. The hair may come out in round patches or across the scalp. The effect is an uneven appearance. The person may pluck other hairy areas, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, or body hair.<br>  <br>  These symptoms are usually seen in children:<br>  <br>      * An uneven appearance to the hair<br>      * Bare patches or all around (diffuse) loss of hair<br>      * Bowel blockage (obstruction) if people eat the hair they pull out<br>      * Constant tugging, pulling, or twisting of hair<br>      * Denying the hair pulling<br>      * Hair regrowth that feels like stubble in the bare spots<br>      * Increasing sense of tension before the hair pulling<br>      * Other self-injury behaviors<br>      * Sense of relief, pleasure, or gratification after the hair pulling<br>  <br>  <br>  also...there is no difference between this and cutting..this one if just less common both are compulsive behaviors|`|AA12055335	Trichotillomania is considered to be a self injurious behavior like cutting. But you have to ask your friend what it is she wants you to do if you see her start to pull her hair. You also have to realize that alot of the times she doesn't realize she is doing it. The urge to "pull" at times can be extremely overwhelming and unavoidable. There are some medications out there that may help relieve the intensity of the desire to "pull", but there is no cure all. Helping your friend think of other things she can do with her hands when she gets anxious or the urge to  pull might help her.  Let her know that you are worried about her and just want to do what is best for her.|`|W3dcQPvzaa	I had it. I would spend hours feeling for a hair of particular thickness, roughness (I'm blonde - the hairs I could feel that were 'different' were dark brown) and length. Then I would slide it along my fingers and then twist it at the root and pull it.<br>  <br>  It was a sign of depression in me. I ended up with seriously large bald patches. I eventually stopped after years after my doctor gave me anti-depressants and I started exercising. And now my hair is growing back thick again. <br>  <br>  I could never have cut myself. I don't think it's as bad as cutting though.
WXExyAlWaa	I would agree that the one psychologist probably shouldn't be dealing with your entire family, it can easily be a conflict of interest. You should try and find someone new, someone who doesn't know your family and who will be unbiased.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Forget about her; concentrate on finding and employing effective treatment for that depression, then begin to look for work, so you can get out of that situation. Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes of exercise, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly in daytime, outside. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, (a free E course in it is at: <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a> ) or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.|`|354ee70c2c4423a17f2d4f038d00cafbaa	Sir. I believe your family is completely ridiculous to start off, and they're only trying to stress you out in your current situation. You need to relax.<br>  <br>  Your psychologist CANNOT give that kind of information about you or anyone else in the family away without your personal consent. There's some forms to be signed for that, if you've signed no forms other than consent for treatment then your information should be completely confidential. <br>  <br>  If she is doing this and you know it for certain then you need to report her to the states health services hub. File the complaint and see where it goes from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	You don't say what state you live in but each state has a department of professional conduct. Go on your states official web site and you should find the information there or  put the information into the search engine. Something like filing a complaint against a medical professional and I don't know about your state but in NY what she's doing would be illegal to have that many patients in the same family unless it was a family situation. I mean where it's the children and the parents family counseling. Since you're an adult you should have a therapist seperate from the rest of your family. So contact your state's department of professional conduct and they would be able to tell you how to file a formal complaint.
