4096b6aafa9c4143516fbac36f327826aa	Crche : le montant que tu verse  la crche varie en fonction du salaire. Si tu ne gagnes pas super bien ta vie, tu ne verseras pas beaucoup et inversement. Cependant, il ne faut pas oublier qu'une crche qui dpend bien souvent  de la mairie, ferme ses portes au moins 2 semaines dans l'anne et que ds que l'enfant est malade (bien souvent parce qu'il y a beaucoup d'enfants), elle ne l'accepte pas.  Nounou : le salaire est en fonction de ce qu'elle te demande par jour, garde + nourriture + entretien. En rgion parisienne, la journe est entre 30 et 40 .  Bien sur, la CAF te reverse une bonne partie par trimestre.  La nounou garde grand max 3 enfants, elle peut le garder si tu lui demandes quand il est malade, elle prend en gnral 4-5 semaines de vacances et peut s'aligner sur les tiennes.  Franchement, ma mre est assistante maternelle et le contact est vraiment diffrent. Les enfants ne sont pas speeds, elles prend le temps. Et pour le contact avec les auters enfants, elles va au parc ou se runit avec d'autres assistantes et les enfants jouent tous ensemble.|`|66045888836280923764aca92926c69caa	je ne sais pas.  Mais a la creche, ton bb est au contact d'autres enfants.  Ce qui n'est pas plus mal, pour l'inserer a etre avec des personnes qu'il ne connait pas.

Mon fils a fait un enfant  18 ans, mais il ne l'a su que quand la fille tait enceinte de 6 mois, et c'tait pour ne pas tre marie de force en Tunisie...  Sa soeur a fait la mme chose et s'est retrouve seule enceinte de 6 mois, le petit ami ayant dcid qu'il ne pouvait pas assumer cette grossesse (alors que c'est lui qui l'a harcele pour faire un bb).

En plus ta fille habite encore avec son pre ( ce qui n'a rien d'anormal pour son age) et en vas s'installer avec son petit ami que parce qu'elle est enceinte.

Intra-Uterine Insemination (also known as artificial insemination) is the process of preparing and delivering sperm so that a highly concentrated amount of active motile sperm is placed directly through the cervix into the uterus. The current IUI pregnancy rate per treatment at UCSF is 14-15%. IUI can be performed with or without fertility drugs for the female patient. Compared to timed intercourse, it is generally accepted that there is a 2-fold higher pregnancy rate with IUI. Thus, for infertility patients, IUI is commonly performed as a low-tech, cost-effective approach to enhancing fertility in patients. Prior to initiating IUI treatment, women must have at least one documented open fallopian tube as demonstrated by hysterosalpingogram (the tubal dye study).     Most women consider IUI to be fairly painless -- along the same lines as having a pap smear. There can be some cramping afterward, but often what is felt is ovulation-related rather than from the IUI. The catheter usually doesn't feel like much since the cervix is already slightly open for ovulation -- a poorly timed IUI might cause more discomfort at the cervix.|`|1e5562d67124e0cd53f3abd1cb430305aa	Intrauterine insemination.

a8827cec5593fc740abeae9be88f6400aa	IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.    My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|e56f4af0392a97bead7ec4a8be859bbaaa	watch the movies, very helpful to you       Original Article:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inferti...      Infertility  Introduction  You and your partner have tried for months, perhaps for even more than a year. But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.  Read the whole article with the link.

P0Fjh59Eaa	my daughter (11 months) does this too. it's probably nightmares. mine cries real tears, pouty lip...the whole bit.   we just rock her back to sleep and she's fine.  children go through changes in their sleep pattern all the time. this could be a change in her sleep pattern, her needing a shorter nap later in the day, nightmares, or she's just having an off week (we all have bad weeks).    i can't let my child scream her head off without checking on her...i mean if it is a nightmare, poor thing!   but, if she is going back to sleep on her own...i wouldn't worry to much.|`|JdmEIDXHaa	My little boy is the same age and is doing something similar - although he's not screaming, he is crying.  I am waiting it out a little. It's only been a week and they do go through a growth spurt every now and then. The molar teeth are also coming though at this age, there's a whole bunch of things that could be happening. Their imagination is also starting to kick in. They might have been having a dream and it woke them up - they woke up and momentarily didn't know what was going on (am I blind??!) weird, but you never know. If they're falling asleep again, I wouldn't be too concerned, but if it continues for much longer (ie around 3 weeks), perhaps take her to a pediatrician.  Good luck!|`|AA11179459	There is a possibility that she is having a bad dream. Different children cope in different ways when having a nightmare. It could also just be a phase for her.|`|AA10537619	i would suggest u give her baby Cirilo then she might sleep all night my babies do.|`|051f5fd4c6e03a0348b4ec3354d2c27baa	She is only 13 months old.  Sleeping patterns change, unfortunately.  The joys of parenthood and freedom all in a nutshell...  You cannot control her sleep, but you can comfort her by singing to her during this time to calm her down.   She is communicating with you.  Is it possible that she is thirsty?  Is her diaper wet and does it need to be changed?  I know my daughter used to wake up when she'd soil her diaper at that age, and she'd cry, but then go back to sleep once I changed her.    Since it's at the same time, it could very well be what's bothering her.  I would definitely check in on her once she calms down tonight, and see if her diaper feels warm...     Also, you could try putting a radio on in her room... this may change her atmosphere in her sleep.  Something soothing, though - nothing heavy or too loud.    Best of luck...|`|9m4gJgIhaa	this is the phase of childhood where toddlers/babies get night fright.  It's a perfectly normal part of growing up-yet its probably more frightening to the parent who believes at the time that something is drastically wrong.

Maybe get her to motion to things that bother her.|`|r7uxjIW5aa	if someone can tell me what cirilo is i would love it! my 13month old is going through the same thing but she has never slept through the night. so when you get your answer please email me!
8b70b962257dfa387c69707168e221d4aa	put him in underwear, non of these pull ups nonsense. Take him to the bathroom every time he wakes up, before and after meals and anytime you or dad have to go. Ask him every 15 to 20 minutes if he needs to go. Praise him highly when he does, say nothing when he has accidents. Just help him get clean and dry again. I guarantee that in two weeks, he'll be potty trained. It only took my first one 3 days to go accident free! My second was stubborn, grrrr, and would pull down his pants and underwear and poop in the floor, pull them back up and keep going. He was tough to get through to, but it only took him about 2 1/2 weeks, and he wasn't showing signs of being ready, at all. (It was time though. I had 6 month old twins, and it was 3 months before his 3rd birthday as well.) I always potty train the Christmas before their third birthday. Which means I'll be potty training twins this time next year. Santa gets them the toys and mom and dad get potty chairs, underwear (you'll need lots and lots of underwear) and anything else. Books to read on the potty an such.    When you go anywhere, be sure to pack two extra pair of underwear, pants, and socks, just in case. Gerber underwear are really nice when he's first learning. They have an absorbent panel in the front. You can also buy those plastic pants, to contain the mess. Just be sure to check often to make sure he's dry. Visit the potty before you leave the house, when you get where you're going, and again before you leave. When you leave him with someone else, make sure they understand that you're potty training. Get rid of his diapers, don't put another one on him, starting tomorrow. I'm telling you, he'll feel it run down his leg a couple times, and not want that to happen anymore. Be sure that they're willing to clean up after him if, and when, he has accidents. (For poopy messes, it's easiest to rinse the underwear in the toliet, and then wash them ASAP. If you have a sitter, you could have the washing machine full of cold soapy water, and she could just though them in. When you get home you can turn in on and wah-lah clean pants!    Good luck, if he's showing signs he's ready it'll be a breeze!    and to comment on your first answer: I don't think three is too late! People let their kids suck on pacifers at four, go get on to THEM. They're ruining their kids teeth for Christ sake! It's a proven fact that starting TOO early actually sets the process BACK. Johnson and Johnson makes a little book, for about 5 bucks, full of potty training tips!|`|AA10339370	Try putting a cheerio in the toilet for  1, make an "aim" game for him. For  2, try giving him some fun potty books, but them on the back of the toilet and let him choose which one he wants to look at. Just give him time. I had the same problem for my little girl. Going  1 was easy, however  2 was hard, until I did the books. Good luck.|`|50bb3ecef11343e6526528c4bf2683b1aa	Place jrs favorite candy in a container out of reach in the bathroom and every time he goes in the potty give him a peice.|`|79bc93e39af5aac7a7a2488c3d47d132aa	Do not reward him with food this is not a good thing to do but definetly reward him with something I got my son a sticker album and every time he used the potty he got to pick a sticker to put in it he was trained in a week  Do not use pull ups  they do not help at all.|`|AA10665012	too early - too late we mommies just can't win!All the advice here sounds pretty standard, so it must work. (eventually) Just remember to keep your cool - set down the new routine - and stick to it (I use a timer to remind ME to check if ds needs to go. ) Everyone promises that if I relax and let it happen it will. GO FIGURE!      Do go and check out dr. phils toilet training ideas - they were helpful. Then by a commercial size bottle of carpet cleaner and a lot of paper towels.     Good luck!    ps - if it takes a week or 2, you may only have 4 or 5 weeks to reinforce the new habit before baby. Be sure to praise praise praise after baby and don't feel mad if he regresses. You may be too tired to deal with it all right now, and after baby2. ??|`|9460b16302dd6ae86ca061778eddce24aa	Wow, three.  Sounds like you're starting a little late.  Make him wear just a t-shirt around the house.  Give him lots of fluids.  Make him sit on the potty atleast 2 times an hour.  Pay really close attention to him and any signs he gives that he has to go.  If you think he does put him on the potty.  Make a really big deal out of it if he goes.  Candy, music, dancing etc. Soon he will relate the sensation with sitting on the potty.  GOOD LUCK|`|a1ad64f94188f3282194600ecfbedb67aa	This is great!  My sister just put my 2.5 year old nephew in "big boy pants" today!  She  grabbed him and held him so he was looking at her.  She said "You cannot pee in these.  If you have to go potty, tell Mom or Dad."  Then, we played wtih him for a while.  Before I left, I said I had to pee.  Nephew got excited because he had to as well.  Sis took him into the bathroom and showed him how to pull down the undies and go.  They usually keep him in a t-shirt when they are around the house, and ask him frequently if he needs to go.  He tends to go by himself if he has no diaper on.  They said that even when he naps without a diaper he tends to hold it, so push for him to go without as much as possible.  I have also heard that the book "Everybody Poops" can help with  2-ing.|`|b59ed866e33babf8595cf5315b43f2bdaa	I understand where you are coming from.  I felt like a bad parent because my son just wouldn't get it.  We started by using no diapers in the day at all and having him wear only a shirt around the house.  If we went out we had back up clothes just in case.  We tried the aim game where you put cheerios in the toilet to help them aim at.  At night we put him in pull ups, just so we didn't have to change his sheets every day.  Once he was used to that we would limit is intake before bed and put him in underwear.  We only had two night accidents.  For the rest of the accidents, we explained to him that if he continued to pee in his pants that he would have to go back into the crib and he wouldn't be able to play with his big boy toys anymore.  He finally got the hang of it and now we have no problems.  I started potty training when he was 2 and he was not completely potty trained until he was about 3 1/2 years old.  He is almost 4 now!  Oh and we also used a reward system in the latter part.  We made a potty chart and if he went a whole week with out an accident we gave him something little like tattoos, pencils, or crayons.  After two weeks we went to the store and he got a toy the he wanted!  That seemed to work really well.  Good luck and congrats on the new baby!|`|8a85c623fe7f4396c35635a2afa17fd5aa	First you'll need lots of patience. Then I used to put my daughter in underwear. I let her pick them out at the store. Then I let her wear them at home and if she had any accidents, Which she did LOTS. I would remove her underwear and she would watch me place them in the washing machine. After about a week, she began to realize that she loved her underwear she picked out and would run to the bathroom and pee in the toilet. Then we would show her how excited we were and of course she loved the attention and that was how it all started. Besides Patience you will need a carpet cleaner, a good one in a spray bottle and lots of bounty paper towel. I trained her in less then 7 days while I was off of work. Good Luck with whatever you choose. :)|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Just because YOU would like to have him out of diapers by the time a new baby arrives doesn't mean he is ready to be potty trained.  As to "all of the signs"...what would they be?  Taking off a diaper, once kids figure out how to do it ALL of them do it not because they're ready to sit on the toilet but because they LIKE being naked.  Ever try putting shoes on a little one?  They don't like it...they prefer being barefooted.  They also prefer their butts being uncovered.  If he is requesting to sit on the toilet then by all means start putting him up there.  Don't expect him to automatically know what to do when he's there though, because he probably doesn't have a clue as to WHY he is there, he just saw someone sit there so he figured he should try it.  If he continues to request, then continue to put him there, then when the one time its timed just right you can praise him and let him know that that is what that seat is for.  But don't figure the job is over.  A child isn't FULLY potty trained until they are dry day and night and until they are don't go putting underwear on him or you'll be washing four or five pairs of underwear a day on top of doing diapers.  And by all means don't do the "pullups" thing.  They're too much like diapers in the way they feel and the child will not get the same sensation when going in underwear as he will with pullups.  Pullups hold in the wetness...undewear doesn't.

The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.    My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|AA10001742	IVF is safe...don't worry. Though its a little painful with lots of hormonal medicines and injections .If you have PCOD then chances of hyper ovulating are high. Buta  good doctor should be able to take care of it.

It drains you emotionally and financially. be ready for all the pain, ups and downs. all the best!    To answer your question- it is NOt harmful
b38441aabeebeda3b0c22493a7037887aa	Nakul and Sahadev   In the Mahabharat, King Pandu had two wives, Kunti and Madri but becaue of a curse from a sage, he was never allowed to make love to his wives thus was unable to have any children.  However, Kunti was given a mantra from another sage when she was young that enabled her to call on any gods to come to her to give her a child.  Kunti used the mantra 3 times and had 3 children.  Madri who was still childless begged Kunti to share the mantra with her.  Once Kunti did, Madri used it to envoke the twin gods, Aswins and she became pregnant with twin boys whom she named Nakul and Sahadev.    Or you could name them Lav and Kush.  Lav and Kush were Sita's sons with Lord Ram in the Ramayan.  After being kidnapped by Ravan, Sita was rescued by her husband Ram.  But after going back to Ayodhya, the citizens didn't believe that Sita had remained faithful to Ram and forced Ram to send Sita into exhile.  She sought refuge in the hermitage of the sage Valmiki, where she was delivered of twin sons, Lav and Kush.  Sita raised her sons single-handedly in the hermitage of the sage Valmiki. Her sons grew up to be valiant and intelligent; they were eventually united with their father some years later.    Or if you don't want any old fashioned names, you could try Rana and Raja - both mean King.    Rohit and Rohan    Rajeev and Sanjeev    Amit and Sumit|`|0d90898fb21fd89941940f0d44b4063caa	Better would be if you look for the name in web, you can find lot of name and can chose from there|`|64240a0bd528a5855d73563bd0fdd732aa	Ike & Mike|`|AA10287238	Daiwik & Debashish
e24d33c25863df1ebee83a512ee14af1aa	My oldest daughter's name is Emma Elizabeth Alicia(Spanish pronunciation, Ah-lee-cee-ah) and my youngest daughter is Anna(which is short for her Aunt's name, Annaliza), Eleanor. I think your friend should do what she wants, sometimes people just need to learn to adapt to things. And her spouse's family will just have to try harder to pronounce the names. I wanted my daughter's, to not just have my culture but my hubby's as well. And my MIL tends to pronounce my youngest daughter's name Ana which is not the way we pronounce it b/c of my family, though now I kinda wish we did.|`|29def52ac159fbd3d1d0ef706db268a9aa	My best friends sister in law is this way.

Some of my family has trouble pronouncing Javier so they either call him Javi or Aden.    My suggestions:    1.  Go with a name that is common and easy to say in both families (Juan, Julio, Roberto, Veronica, Victoria, Eva)    2.  Go with a Spanish first name with an easier middle name or vise versa.    3.  Go with a Spanish name that has an easy nickname (Javier=Javi, and I can't think of a girl off the top of my head but you get the idea)    Good luck with the names|`|64cf4032323590ed1f92ff2209074919aa	i named my daughter daniela, she has a very mexican middle name, but the name daniela isnt bad, just people keep calling her danielle or spelling it that way.

If we have another boy his name will be Andres--which is the Hispanic form of Andrew.  I like it.  They aren't "too" Hispanic and hard to pronounce but they do have their back ground in the culture.  As for your friend--I think there's a way to name children where everyone can pronounce it.  If not, who cares?  I think nicknames are great when it comes to aunts, uncles, and grandparents.  It's up to your friend.  I hope this helps!|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	My sister's friend had a baby recently and named him Ramiro.

OLfcpnGbaa	I wouldnt wait until next week to ask to get paid. I would call her todayand just say you were reviewing your payments from last week and looks like you missed theirs and wanted to see if they could drop it off or if you could come get it this afternoon once the children are gone. After you got your check I would just tell her and it hasnt been working out and you would prefer if they found another babysitter starting next week. If she is off all week she can spend a little time to find another babysitter.     If they wont pay you dont allow their child back. If they dont try to bring him back and dont pay you, you can turn them over to the police for theft of services. Check with them to see what you have to do, I know with the company I work for we have to send them a certified letter and give them 10 days to pay, if they dont pay after that the police will take the case and put a warrant out until they pay you.     Good luck getting your money!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I suggest when they show up next week that you tell the parents you need paid for the week they didn't and the new week as well upfront. Let the parents know as well on Friday of the last week that you are not going to be available any longer to watch their child due to the out of control behavior he displays.    If they refuse to pay you and you can prove it with records of your own that they didn't you can take the parents to small clains court and sue for what they owe you and the court fees you would otherwise need to pay.  They sound like jerks.|`|7HEZhx46aa	You're sort of over a barrel here. If you call them up NOW and say you do not want to watch this child any longer because he's not controllable, they probably won't pay you. If you wait until they bring him to you again, THEN tell them, you'll end up watching him anyway.    You have to decide which is more important -- getting paid or not having to deal with this brat any more. I'd opt for the latter.|`|lFenXNCzaa	Immediately, tell her to pay you.|`|RocDozwvaa	don't take the child back if they did not pay you for that week it's possible it will happen again, get yourself another job that you know you'll get paid for sure, you don't have to thru that bullsh*t again|`|ovzUvTifaa	Contact them and let them know that you would like to discuss your pay for last week.  Let them know that you expected to be paid like every other week and would like to know what's going on with their situation and why they felt it was okay not to pay you.  (I'm assuming they didn't let you know ahead of time that they couldn't or wouldn't be.)  Let them know kindly that you know they're going to bring their child back on xx date and would like payment then - or before then.  (If you plan on continuing to watch him.  Tip:  YOU could be the role model this child needs.  Try to get creative with him.  I understand that some children are 'worse' to begin with but I was a nanny for awhile and know that children can be turned around.  Have you ever watched Supernanny? lol)    If you truly don't plan on ever babysitting for them again, contact them just the same let them know that you're expecting to be paid for last week and would like to set up a time and date to meet with them for your pay.  Let them know that you will not be able (or do not wish to) supervise their child anymore and let them know that they will need to find someone else to care for him.  If you DON'T tell them in advance and wait until they show up the next time to see if they pay you, that is BAD business and bad karma.  You need to always be the professional and take the high road in all situations - including this one.  It is not easy to find a childcare provider at the last minute - and if they don't have one it means no going to work, no making pay for that day to provide for their family, and possibly a bad confrontation with their boss for calling in.    IF however, you contact them and they agree to pay you when they bring him next time to drop him off and they show up with him and no money, politely let them know that you both agreed to a certain scenario and that you will not be available for them until you have been paid what you are past due.  In this case, they understood fully the consequences of their decision and they are responsible for having to take the day off to find another means of child care.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Call and let her know she forgot to pay you and that if you don't receive payment by a certain date, you will be taking her to court. Then, explain that with her son's behavior problems, and her lack of interest in his care (i.e. not paying you), you will be finding another child to fill her child's spot.|`|1Kyc0tZQaa	tell them they cannot bring him back until they pay u and when they pay u say sorry this just isn't working out. Its mean but u did work those hours........................so u deserve to be paid for them.good luck|`|3SRGUv1maa	as soon as they are paid up, tell them. Make sure if they ask you what they owe you include everything up to that day.|`|UAZv1AfPaa	Tell them they need to pay you for last week and this coming week now in advance, then just watch him one more week and tell them you can't watch any longer and why|`|I5bLrtTLaa	I am a experienced babysitter. I have had lots of problem parents to deal with. This is a strange situation because the parents bring the kid over to your place. As long as you made a proper agreement at the beginning, that they will pay you for your work, you should not be afraid to say, ''Hey, I would like to get paid! I thought we had an agreement!''  Once you get paid, and only ONCE YOU GET PAID, can you say you would not like to babysit that child anymore. You have every right to just sever the deal right there. You don't work, they don't pay. If worst comes to worst, and they keep  bringing the child over to your place, just don't answer the door.   Hope that helps.|`|TX2JTQj3aa	Insist they have to pay up front or don't take the child.  There is no other option tell them.  If they don't pay up front, then they can go do what they did to you to someone else.  I'm a mom of 4 and a prior lisenced day care.
c691dde2b8d05cf6b1522ab67f8f5568aa	I worked in a women's prison. They send the mother out to a contracted hospital (where they send their prisoners in need of medical attention that the infirmary can't provide). They have a female CO in the room with her. The inmate is hand cuffed to the bed railing. Most hospitals will give her something other than an epidural because of the sharps (needle). It depends on the hospital and the prison.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	People in prison, don't usually give birth in prison.  They have their children in hospitals like most people do.  The only reason I can see them not being offered an epidural is if they have some type of drug dependency.|`|f95b43e2dba7d365a145f0e538775518aa	I don't agree with the first answer-lots of women who are in prison are actually innocent and don't belong there in the first place, so you can't label them all.    Now, to answer your question-to me, not to have it atleast offered is cruel and I don't think just because you are in prison you should be treated cruel. I bet if she wants it, she gets it.     Very interesting question!!|`|jYPeis3Saa	sorry, but who cares? shes in prison!! she commited a crime.  criminals already get to many things while in there.    i do not feel sorry for any criminal|`|e298a5f6160975d21c9e41ccf16aade3aa	Prisoners are entitled to adequate medical care during incarceration.  Some are transferred to hospitals to deliver and I'm sure others deliver in the prison if it has proper facilities for birth and it's possible complications.  I doubt very seriously you would find a woman giving birth inside her jail cell.|`|002a41735c3888a42ae6853a1d35f919aa	I would have thought she'd be moved to a hospital (a secure one???) for the actual birth. She should have access to the same medical care and pain relief as everyone else, the only difference being that the babby will go straight into care and she'll go back to prison!    I'm just guessing though...|`|6c0eba6e0ed93d63bbc3c4e08176fb74aa	I think it depends on the prision.  Some prisions have programs where mom can keep baby until they are one or two years old to nurse them and such.  It really depends on where she is and what she did to get there.|`|2TlFtlXmaa	Ok i think they would just have her have her baby at the jail hospital so that way it would be better for her when she done having the baby she would not have to back to jail she would already be there

XpBP417taa	Secondo me aiuta a crescere il buon senso. In una giornata possono venir fuori 40 "no" e 3 "s" ( se  una giornata particolarmente sfigata!) ma questo non significa che il giorno dopo debba andare peggio. L'importante  argomentarlo.  Non si pu certo dire di no a tutto, come fanno quelle madri iperprotettive che dicono di no anche se il figlioletto raccoglie un sassetto! Finirebbero per tirar su un frustrato! Per se quello mette la mano nel fuoco bisogna dirgli "NOOOOOOOOOOOO"!!  :-D|`|abb7391b2774843f7af6545b70105668aa	aiutano solo se abbianti ad una spiegazione adatta alla loro et per cui fare una determinata cosa non  possibile.  io lo vedo con la mia bimba.

Quindi dire no  necessario se non doveroso, ovviamente a ragion veduta.  Non a caso si dice che i nonni viziano i bimbi, appunto perch sono quelli che generalmente sono pi permissivi nei loro confronti anche su cose apparentemente futili come ad esempio congere la cioccolata o la patatina prima del pranzo. ( non mi piace generalizzare, non me ne vogliano i nonni)  Dietro ad ogni NO  opportuno che ci sia anche una spiegazione, che sicuramente non verr recipita la prima volta ma con l'andare del tempo questa forma di educazione porter i sui frutti.

Desde luego hay que buscar la causa, porque es arriesgado y no es normal que te suceda de manera tan recurrente.    Que te hagan pruebas, lo del calcio no creo yo que sea un buen tratamiento. Tal vez tienes un problema de odo o cervicales y pierdes el equilibrio o es por la anemia (?te han dado suplemento de hierro?) o por una bajada de glucosa.    Prate a pensar qu es lo que sucede 5 segundos antes de acerte: sensacin de desvanecimiento (flojera de piernas, visin borrosa) o fallo fsico de las extremidades inferiores (piernas o pie).    Aprovecho a comentarte que las principales autoridades sanitarias recomiendan que las mujeres embarazadas y lactantes tomen un suplemento diario de Yoduro Potsico (las embarazadas aparte deben tomar otro de cido Flico) para evitar serios problemas.    Un abrazo y que TE MEJORES.    PDA: mira las fuentes que te doy sobre lo del yodo|`|qXInYPwaaa	No estes triste amiga, disfruta esta etapa que es maravillosa y todo lo que te sucede tiene solucin. Mira de seguro el medico te receto algo para la anemia que dentro de todo es como bien comun dentro del embarazo y puedes ayudarte comiendo cosas con hierro como la batarraga, lentejas, alcachofas... todo eso ayudara a mejorar tu anemia. En cuanto al peso tambien lo puedes controlar con una dieta saludable, comiendo cosas llenas de vitaminas y en medidas justas, evitando mucha sal y azucar y golosinas, te aseguro que puedes lograrlo. Mi hermana sufrio de diabetes gestacional y la pusieron a regimen embaraza de mi sobrinito y le fue super bien, casi no subio de peso y quedo regia... as que tu tambien puedes. Referente a las caidas anda con cuidado, el peso sobre tus rodillas puede probocar que caigas y eso es peligroso, pero no te desanimes, solo ten un poco mas de cuidado por donde pisas, camina reposado y no te preocupes en exceso... ANIMO de seguro todo saldra bien.

Ma parlo da persona amareggiata da due genitori che non hanno saputo dare amore, forse perch loro stessi non conosco amore, non amando neppure se stessi...    Essere genitori significa essere vicini ai propri figli in ogni momento, pur sapendo tenere le giuste distanze... Perch i propri figli devono imparare a camminare da soli.  Essere genitori significa consolare i figli nei momenti peggiori, aiutarli a rincominciare, consigliarli.... Sapendo per che tante volte  giusto lasciarli sbagliare, anche se la cosa in fondo al cuore brucia... Perch si vuole sempre il meglio per i propri figli, si vorrebbe la loro felicit eterna...  Essere genitori significa rimboccare tutte le sere le coperte ai propri figli che si addormentano sicuri e sereni nei propri lettini sognando giochi e magie.... Ed essere l quando si sveglieranno terrorizzati dalla visione di un brutto mostro...  Essere genitori...

Infatti non occorre saper baciare, se sei innamorata viene spontaneo, non fare come la ragazzina delle mozzarelle perch  una violenza a se stesse. Vogliamo metterci in testa che l'erotismo  un istinto e non ha bisogno di andare a scuola? Mi fanno sorridere ragazzi e ragazze che temono di non sapere come si fa. Se sei innamorata non devi sapere nulla, lo fai e basta, il problema sorge quando dell'altro non ti frega un tubo. Per cui aspetta di innamorarti, allora vedrai che viene tutto spontaneo. Molte ragazzine e ragazzini lo fanno per sentirsi grandi ma per l'anima  una violenza. La libert sessuale significa anche questo: non forzarsi mai.|`|b2e9dd5215054ba5c4aba3f41470fe40aa	io l'ho dato 3 mesi fa...cmq  stato molto bello,ma cmq  normale che a 15 anni nn hai ancora baciato...vedrai che arrivar il momento e la persona giusta...|`|58799107a2d1503168cf0f1eb3e16908aa	Ma figurati....non c' un'et stabilita x baciare......

Quindi bacia chi consideri importante,cos ti rester un bel ricordo.....|`|t01VfPb0aa	ciao ...io ero grandicella.. avevo 18 anni...|`|df661924c5aed67d22252e412d58e245aa	 normale, tranquilla, c' chi a 18-20 anni non ha ancora baciato nessuno (non vale per me)...  io l'ho dato a 14 anni...    baciotti|`|4Cl0fsOIaa	t consiglio d aspettare ke arrivi il tuo momento...io avevo 11 anni e nn  stato gran ke...nn era la xsn adatta e fin qnd nn trovi una xsn ke t piace veramente nn riesci a star bn mentre la baci...nn andare di fretta e nn farlo sl xk t senti in ritardo... il tuo momento arriver...ciao baci|`|38f409835d0f7b2fa89793cd7331020aaa	Non preoccuparti, io tra poco compiro' 25 anni e non ho ancora dato il mio primo bacio. Trova il ragazzo giusto (non so se sei femmina, ma leggendo le altre risposte pare di si', forse ti conoscono per via di altre domande)!    P.S.: daro' il mio primo bacio alla donna della mia vita!|`|ZBEl8HlUaa	Forse sono stata un po' ritardataria...l'ho dato a 20anni ed  stato bellissimo!!! Probabilmente se l'avessi dato prima non mi sarebbe piaciuto cos tanto!   Sei normalissima, vai tranquilla|`|w9NhkNPTaa	il mio primo baccio e stato 14 ann. e stato bello.non avere tanta fretta che arrivera' anche x te.  un baccio da sailor|`|bJStiZaUaa	Be io a 11 anni ma ero una ragazzina piuttosto vivace... cmq nn c' niente di male evidentemente non sei ancora sbocciato... ti consiglio solo di aspettare la ragazza che ti piace e non provare a darlo tanto cos perch ti perderesti una bellissima esperienza!! Vedrai che presto arrivera una bella tua coetania con cui passerai bellissimi momenti!|`|PlV5mWh7aa	io avevo quasi 17 anni, non ti preoccupare, non  mica una gara e se qualcuno te lo fa pesare come una "mancanza"  un salame! io ho dato il primo bacio quando avevo voglia di farlo e non me ne sono pentita, anche se le mie amiche gi dalle scuole medie mi trattavano come un ufo perch a loro interessava e a me no.Ho dato il primo bacio alla persona che amavo ed  stato bello solo per quello.Darlo a una persona qualunque tanto per dare un bacio l'avrebbe reso squallido|`|8vP5Azucaa	io ne avevo 13 e ricordo che prima di darlo feci allenamento per 2 settimane slinguazzando una mozzarelle.|`|tX2OdFaFaa	 normale stai tranquilla,non preoccuparti x queste cose,arriver anche il tuo bel momento!!  io avevo 12 anni,ed  stato bellissimo!!  baci da stella  ciao|`|tFStHS8aaa	Beh.... si potrebbe essere normale, d'altro canto  ben difficile spiegare almeno a parole le sensazioni o cosa ci si prova a dare o ricevere il primo bacio, anche e perch spesso gioca molto il fattore dall'emotivit e di conseguenza ogni individuo reagisce sempre in un modo diverso l'uno dall'altro.  C' una cosa instintiva che ci accomuna spesso e soprattutto nei primi momenti, la pi chiara o particolarmente evidenziata e questa cosa viene chiamata timore di commettere errori con conseguenze di disagio nei confronti del partner ma tutto sommato non  poi cos tanto preoccupante perch e come ho gi detto siamo appena all'inizio magari di una lunga e felice storia di due persone che si vogliono bene.|`|42UWZ6hkaa	certo... normale...io l'ho dato a 13 anni ed  stato emozionante ma nn il massimo....ciao e un bacio|`|VZmfaYmUaa	no...x arriver anche x te il tuo momento cmq perora goditi la vita....ke  molto,molto meglio...fidati!!!!!!|`|Dy4CJ9Usaa	Bell'argomento...!!!Pensa,io avevo 17 anni quando ho dato il mio primo bacio...Non perch ero considerata una sfigata,ma perch la vedevo come una cosa importante!!!E'stato,inizialmente traumatico.Pensavo di fare brutta figura,pensavo di nn saperlo fare bene,avevo paura di non sapere "usare bene la lingua"...MAMMA MIA quanti pensieri!!!Dopo,invece, stato bellissimo...Ti lasci trascinare,vivi mille emozioni in un solo istante e te ne freghi dei pensieri che avevi l'attimo prima...Non ti preoccupare,vedrai che arriver anche per te!!!Fammi sapere...Baci.|`|KvNiQ8H1aa	beh un semplice bacio ^o) cmq a 13 anni...|`|67ac5a06c3a2d8c4c99ee8134bcfb6caaa	Certo ke  normale!!! Nn c' un'et in cui bisogna per forza averlo dato!!!! Non c' mica una scadenza oltre la quale subentra l'anormalit!!!!!! Te lo dice UNA KE HA DATO IL PRIMO BACIO A 22 anni appena compiuti! Ovvio, mi  mancato durante tutta l'adolescenza, ma i tempi li decide il destino e se c' una cosa sbagliatissima,  quella d forzare i tempi! nn solo si rischiano delusioni, ma nn c si guadagna niente! Quindi per te e per chiunque, abbiate pazienza! Con la fretta non si combina nulla!|`|0dsxDW5Baa	io ne avevo circa 15 o 16 supergiu....credo sia normale non avere ansie...tanto arriva...|`|wjulTN3qaa	Non dvi vedere l'et che hai per dare il primo bacio, ma devi solo aspettare, arriver il momento giusto e capiter, ogni cosa ha i suoi tempi!|`|3BAaIw8yaa	Lo dato a 15 anni..!!qualke mese fa....esattamente il 2 gennaio..cn il ragazzo ke star cn me x sempre.. bellissimo..avevo una paura tremenda...per poi  tutto spontaneo e tremendamente bello...arriver anke il tuo momento tranquilla...e goditelo al massimo xk  una cosa meravigliosa!!!!|`|8IlW2S7Laa	io ti dico che  normale e non sei unica...io il mio primo bacio,l'ho dato quando avevo 15 anni e mmhh 5 mesi...quindi tranquilla:)|`|YsMVfPOaaa	io l'ho dat a 18anni..pensa un p!!ero timidissima qndo si trattava di dare un bacio a un ragazzo..e sono contenta di aver aspettato,perch alla fine l'ho dato al mio amore,con cui sto da 2 anni..e cmq c' d peggio!una mia amica ha 23 anni e ancora deve dare 1 bacio!qndi..vai tranquilla! ^_^|`|4VtRiyRMaa	il bacio, un'apostrofo rosa tra le parole ti amo.....frase scontatissima lo so, ma mi serviva semplicemnte per dirti di non avere fretta, il primo bacio  molto importante e se devi darlo, allora anche chi lo ricever deve essere altrettanto importante. io facevo la terza media, lui aveva due anni pi di me ed ero innamoratissima di lui fin dalle elementari.  stato l'more della mia adolescenza e ora dopo tanti anni (lui sposato con figli) ripenso con gioia a quella volta. Le esperienze che si fanno da adolescenti, sono quelle che ti restano dentro e che ti accompagnano anche quando si diventa grandi. Fa in modo che fra qualche anno il ricordo del tuo primo bacio sia per te un dolce pensiero. Il primo bacio deve essere dato col cuore, non sprecarlo solo perch hai fretta di darlo.|`|9faxM7Odaa	ciao...anche io ho 14 anni..compiuti la sett. scorsa.. cmq io ho avuto la possibilt di baciare 4 raga. k me l'avevano chiesto ma siceramente  io ho SCHIFO  a baciare 1 raga. piuttosto bacio una ragazza.( non pensate male...). ciao  e stai trnquilla...|`|InAj6kcuaa	Ciao anke io avevo quasi 18 anni e l'ho dato dietre le quinte prima di fare una sfilata ad un ragazzo ke mi piaceva tantissimo...x dopo poco venni a scoprire ke era fidanzato e ci rimasi male xk dieti il mio primo bacio a uno stronzoo...x nn mi pento xk in quel momento era quello ke mi sentivo di fare!!!in bocca al lupo e prima di fare un passo rifletti e cerca di capire se  la xsona giusta!!!xk il primo bacio nn si scorda mai|`|npVnHGQsaa	No...tranquilla...troverai il raga giusto a cui darlo...nn fare lo sbaglio di darlo al primo ke incontri...io l'ho dato in 1media il my primo kiss...ad un raga ke m  diventato un cesso...ma proprio cesso...mamma mia...cerco sempre di negarlo quel bacio... :P! kmq...x me,il my primo vero bacio,l'ho dato alla persona di cui mi ero (e sono) veramente innamorata e ke poi finalmente sn riuscita a tenere stretta a me...tuttora...e spero xs.  baci...e buona fortuna...|`|lYVBUbfUaa	anche io ho 15 anni e il mio primo bacio l' ho dato a 14... ma adesso me ne pento perch l' ho dato al ragazzo sbagliato. sai, il primo bacio  una cosa importante che ricorderai per sempre e perci non devi darlo solo perch hai paura che c' un limite di tempo...

3EhoJ42zaa	I've heard it too.  When I had my first I was no longer sore after 3-4 days, I was still bleeding, but not sore.  I didn't tear and I had a very smooth delivery so that could be why.  I probably could have had intercourse at 2 weeks pp, but I didnt want to because I wanted to heal and because I was still bleeding.  I waited until 4 1/2 weeks to have intercourse again (I strongly recomend waiting the 6 weeks ladies! and lots of lube!).  Some women feel ready earlier.|`|rURYaq45aa	honestly to me it seems very painful cause you are still kinda bleeding after two weeks and you are not fully healed yet. plus they tell you to wait at least 6 weeks to start having sex again. it doesn't even sound realistic. it sounds very painful so i would say no|`|BKr3y30maa	Some women do.  But it's strongly not recommended. You need time to recover.|`|iNBLWIFKaa	Yes, I did after my second pregnancy. It was a really easy delivery. The first time it was not until about 4 weeks and it still was uncomfortable. But with my second pregnancy, 2 weeks was all I needed and I felt great. Both pregnancies were vaginal. My first pregnancy the babies were 4 pounds 4 oz (both, they were twins) and the next pregnancy I had a 6 pound 9 oz baby.|`|H7MSxgZ7aa	its there strong need|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	oh god i know!!  i no a women who has 2 sons born in the same year! so basically she gave birth on monday had sex on tuesday!   i crossed my legs at the very thought!!|`|SBJNJEBBaa	lol i know i dont see it, i waited 8 weeks and still then it hurt, but i also had 4th degree rip but i guess its possible! lol but i bet it hurt|`|DPegPYRPaa	EEEEK! I didn't want to even after 6 weeks!    That is crazy!
DPegPYRPaa	I thought this would happen with my daughter too but when I made it into a toddler bed she was so excited and she actually stayed there and went to sleep. Maybe try sleeping in there with her the first few nights until she gets the hang of it. Kids are kids, and she will most likely get up and try to play. You will just have to go in there and tell her no and put her back in bed.|`|hiD30bDraa	Wow you pregnant again already! Just joking my son has a toddler bed hes 2 and yea its time to get her her own bed for her own independance. Trust she will like it and they come with gards|`|sw2R5A9iaa	save your money -put a twin bed in the room near the crib.  lower the crib rails & let the child choose where she wants to sleep.  put a night light & sound soother in the room, always have a fresh cup of water, and let the child play quietly or read while she learns to self soothe herself to sleep.|`|NSBL9bDFaa	my daughter turned two in January too! we have been making the transition by only using the bed for naps and enforcing the rules of the big girl bed....i clean her room really well and try to get as many toys as i can..out of sight...this sounds so horrible as a parent but she has a little princess TV and DVD player, and somtimes ill pop in Dora or Backyardigans and put on the sleep timer, it keeps her in bed, and she falls right to sleep! baby number 2 is due anyday so i really need her out of that crib!|`|bc5jGZ0uaa	I'm in the same predicament too!  My daughter is exactly the same except she turned 2 in October and I'm due June 1st.  I plan on having the new baby in a bassinet for 2-4 months depending on how big he is, but start switching her to a toddler bed sometime after this one is born.  Maybe she can take naps in the bed while I'm home on maternity leave and just slowly switch her to it full time.  I am scared though that she will just run wild in her room though- but she's gotta do it sooner or later.  good luck!!
HXfHkoSHaa	It really sounds to me like your blood pressure is up.  If it's not better soon, go get checked by the dr.|`|OT1VzqyYaa	Try calling your OB and talk to the nurse. They can tell you if you need get checked out.|`|DPegPYRPaa	I would go in and have it checked out. You can never be too safe.
WbJPQM1naa	Every child deserves a stable home life.  If she is stable and thriving with her father in Germany, I wouldn't want to disrupt that stability to try to win and argument about her custody.  Unfortunately, in these types of cases, there is no winner, and the children become innocent casualties of the war.      I had a custody dispute with my older children and they lived with their father for the two and half years we were in and out of court.  When the final order was made, giving him full custody, many said I should have appealed that and continued to fight for them.  But, I felt that it wasn't fair to them to continue to have the wrangling between their father and myself.  So, I chose to not pursue it any further.  My children have done ok, raised by their father and his wife.  I have missed my time with them and our relationship has now been completely severed.  I didn't want to become the "bad guy", though, by constantly bringing issues and fights to the court.    Channel your energy into something which is more satisfying for you, as a non custodial parent.  Communicate in letters, cards and gifts often and work to save up so you can travel there to visit once or twice a year.  Keep communications open to let your child know how much you love and care for them.  I have had to do that, even with a parent who refused to allow them to speak to me or call me.  I still call and leave messages every holiday and b-day.  Your love can go on for your child and eventually, when you are asked why you didn't fight harder, you can say it was your love and concern for their welfare.      Good luck.  R
bmoCpcdraa	use lice shampoo send her to school and tell them that you keep cleaning her head for a week now and when she comes home she has it again they will check the other kids by the way they wont tell you what other kids have it but the law is not one egg allowed or they will send them back home you can clean her head with conditioner and small comb wash everthing put stuff animals in trash bag for 30 days put pillow in dryer buy spray for your furniture check yourself and all in home|`|AA10186411	First off, calm down.  Lice is not what people make it out to be.  Lice clings moreso to CLEAN hair than dirty. (Its easier to move around) So people assuming its because someone is dirty is completely false.  Most kids get lice as children.  They so quickly can jump to other heads.  Just get her some NIT from a drug store and get rid of it.  Alert her teacher, who will probably keep it anonymous anyway.  I know my child's daycare keeps it anonymous.  Just so she can tell the other parents to check their children.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Just call the school and tell them. They can keep it confidently. And lice is not a dirty thing. Lice tend to be drawn to clean hair, its easy to move around in. After you get this problem taken care of i would start putting hair spray or gel in her hair before she leaves in the morning.|`|nfzQkvqraa	More than likely she's had lice for a while.  If it's easily visible and there's a bunch of eggs.....there's no way to tell who got it from whom.  I would definitely call the school nurse and ask what there rules are for lice.  Don't be embarrassed.  Lice doesn't discriminate.  They don't care if your rich or poor, clean or dirty etc.      Good luck getting rid of them.  You'll get tons of different answers about how to do that.  I'm telling you that the over the counter stuff doesn't work effectively enough and your child will end up with it all over again.  You have to go to the doctor and get a prescription or painstakingly go through your child's hair several times pulling everything out.  But other people will tell you differently.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	Clean her hair ASAP with special lice shampoo. Disinfect her bed, sheets, blankets, pillows, EVERYTHING in her room! You must call her school and alert the school's nurse so other children can be checked.

I would show a staff member at the school when you bring your daughter back, that, you treated her, and she`s not the cause of any further outbreak. You`re right, it could be one child causing the issue, not being treated properly.  PS, When she goes back to school braid her hair and put hair spray in it..

Yes, you can be pregnant if you have unprotected sex.  Once, I thought I was, and my husband asked the pharmisist which at home test is best?  He said that the cheapest one is the best, because all of them test for the same horomone.  Go to the dollar store and pick one up, or a really cheap one anyway.|`|d65b967e4ec0af6e66ade5e74cacccecaa	No, It's almost impossible.  Even if the M-A-P didn't work, it takes around 6 days for the egg to implant itself on the uterus, you can possibly get some bleeding at this time "implantation bleeding".  With the M-A-P it should be taken up to 72 after unprotected sex, though the earlier it is taken, the more chance it has of working properly.  IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO GET PREGNANT AFTER TAKING THE M-A-P IF YOU WAIT TO LONG TO TAKE IT.  Most of the symptoms seem to be headache, nausea, painful breasts and irregular vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Though you don't mention abdominal pain, what you have could be related.    If you happen to be pregnant, you will begin to feel the baby around 17-22 weeks, so it's a while off yet.    Good Luck

AA12381247	Just about every guy wonders how he measures up in the down-there department at one time or another. Heres the lowdown for any guy whos ever worried about whether his penis is a normal size.   Theres a fairly wide range of normal penis sizes - just as there is for every other body part. And just like other parts of the body, how a penis appears at different stages of a guys life varies quite a bit. You wouldnt expect someone who is 11 years old to look the same as someone whos 19.  Guys normally develop at different times. Some may start developing as early as 9. Others may not start developing until 15 or even later. The age at which a guy starts to grow varies from person to person. It all depends on when he enters puberty and his hormones start doing their thing.   Growth in penis size is just one part of puberty, which also includes such changes as pubic hair development, testicular growth, muscle development, and a growth spurt. Late starters almost always catch up fine - they just reach full maturity a little later.   Penises come in different sizes, shapes, and colors. These traits are hereditary, like eye color or foot size, and theres nothing you can do to change them. Despite what you may hear or read, no special exercises, supplements, or diets will speed up the development process or change a guys size. Also, like his feet, a guys penis may appear smaller to him just because the perspective is different when hes looking down. And theres a lot less difference in penis size between guys when they get an erection (a ***** or hard on) than when their penises are relaxed.  In addition to size, guys also wonder about other aspects of how their penises look, such as whether the skin covering the penis is normal or if its OK for a guys penis to hang to the left or right (it is!). If youre concerned about how your penis looks, ask your doctor. Guys who are reaching puberty should have regular testicular exams, so thats a good time to ask your doctor any questions.   Taking a ride on the hormonal roller-coaster means lots of changes - and a lot of common worries - for both guys and girls. Just as guys may wonder about how their penises develop, lots of girls ask the same thing about their breasts.   If youre wondering about your development, dont try to compare yourself to your older brother or your best friend - theyre probably at a different stage of development than you are anyway. The important thing to remember is that its OK to not be a mirror image of the guy at the next urinal.   Get out the tweezers and the microscope :)    You probably have a good sense of where you fit in the distribution of size for  more commonly visible measurements of body size: height, size of hands, feet,  weight and so on. However, unless you spend a lot of time in a nudist  environment, there are, understandably other measurements for which you dont  have a good sense of where you fit. Penis size is an obvious example. Its also  one that can make a lot of people uncomfortable. They worry about whether they  are abnormal, too small, too large, and so on. As with most characteristics  of human anatomy, there is a lot of individual variation. You can differ  substantially from average without being unusual or freakish and without any  need for concern or medical intervention. If you have concerns, by all means  consult a doctor, but chances are good that you have nothing to worry about.    On the other hand, there is always a fascination with people who are  significantly different for the normal range. This applies to height and  weight, size of hands and feet, and, yes, also to penis size. So what  is normal? Surprisingly, perhaps, given how common concerns about penis size  seem to be, there are very little good data based on large samples. There are  data, though, and the numbers seem to agree well enough to suggest that the  sample size must be large enough to give reasonably accurate measures of  averages and distributions.      There are additional links there to other studies as well.    The average length of an erect penis (measured along the top) is 16.1 cm (6.34  in).  90% of measurements fall between 10 and 21 cm (4 and 8.25 in).  The average girth of an erect penis is 12.3 cm (4.84 in).  The average length of the flaccid penis is about 9 cm (3.5 in) with most  measurements falling between 5 cm (2 in) and 12.5 cm (5 in).    These numbers appear to be approximately independent of such parameters as age  (post-puberty) and nationality despite any anecdotal information you may have  heard to the contrary, though reliable data on such variations is quite limited.    You can decide what big is, but just as you probably wouldnt particularly  label someone as tall unless they were in the top few percent, you probably  wouldnt want to label someones penis as big unless it was larger than the  normal ranges quoted above (greater than 21 cm erect length, 12.5 cm flaccid  length). There also appears to be a large variability in the ratio of the erect  length to flaccid length. Average is about 1.8, but ratios from about 1 to 4  are not uncommon.    You can turn up a lot of additional reading material on this subject with a Google search :    Average penis size    I hope this information helps you to better understand what is normal  and big. Again, if you have concerns, consult your doctor. You may also see  many advertisements for companies that claim to help you increase penis size. I  would caution you against considering their services because of questionable  efficacy in many cases, and because it is unlikely that there is any real  reason why you should need to c|`|AA11038398	No clue, as i have never seen a 15 year old penis nor do i care too ask your dad|`|1985b4ac9aca0730376d0ed82b0ab101aa	About 10 inches, which means you are about 8 too short, LOL|`|16dbaacecc042f0cb7f200ffda7d2c96aa	At 15 you should not be worried about the size of your penis.

With my 2nd baby I tried walking, sex, spicy food, pineapple, red raspberry leaf tea, evening primrose oil (which I started too late at 40 weeks, but it did help some), and black cohosh tea and still ended up being induced at 41 weeks. So I was in the hospital when my labor started that time as well. The evening primrose oil actually helped ripen my cervix in just a few days though with my 2nd baby, but I had started it too late for it to really do much good. I started it this time at 36 weeks (I'm 36w4d now) and I go to the doctor tomorrow so I'm hoping for some good news from it!

When he doesn't clean up his room when I ask, I walk in with a garbage bag and start cleaning it myself - he usually gets the idea quick enough and starts cleaning.   Sometimes I will clean up his room and I make him pay me $1.00  - my cleaning service fee, and he doesn't like to give up money either.  Good Luck|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I'm familiar with that behaviour, I work in an elementary school in after school programs and we have fifth graders telling us "We're teenagers now and, like, we've done all the stuff on the playground, already." Complete with eye rolling, hand on hip, full blown attitude. I'll tell you what the secret is: sometimes you just have to walk away and have a laugh at the absurdity of girls. Being physically abusive isn't going to get you anywhere with a sassy kid and will probably only escalate the situation, I'm sure you'd rather your daughter know she can come to you when she's in trouble or worrying over something than be resentful. I always call the girls out on their attitudes by telling I don't appreciate the eye-rolling and back talking and they will talk to me with respect or they will be sitting in time out like a little kid until they can talk like they are nine or eleven. To eliminate the "forgetting" tell her you want her room clean in twenty minutes and set the timer, make sure she knows there will be an inspection. As she is able to "remember" in the short term you can try telling her, "I'd like you room clean (or whatever else) within the next two hours." The most important thing I've discovered is not to let the attitude get you riled up so you are reacting to her, stay calm and respectful with your voice and repeat your request. Nine times out of ten, just that will stop the 'tude.|`|nrQijvMuaa	My son is 6 and he is in that stage of "attitude" at school he is a saint but once he is home he acts up.

My daughter is 7 and always has a stomach ache when its time to clean her room lol. So if she doesnt have it clean by dinner time, no tv at bedtime. Since she is kind of young, I help her out a bit, tell her where to start; put blankets and stuffed animals on your bed, put dirty clothes in the hamper, etc. And when she is almost finished, I go in and help out a little. Also, when she tells me it is done, I say "ok so anything on the floor is garbage right?" She always runs right back in to finish up. Other punishments are going to bed early, taking away her Wii or Ipod, etc. If its really bad like blatantly being rude I will make her sit at the kitchen table all afternoon. She cannot do anything, no writing, reading, nothing and I make her sit up because she will ball up and fall asleep lol. I wouldn't get physical at her age. I was in on the spanking until my daughter hit about 5 years old. I don't want that to be part of her teen years (us being physical) and there are better punishments now that she gets what it is to have things taken away. Since rolling her eyes might not be a big enough crime to give a punishment for I would give her 3 strikes. Each time she is rude or disrespectful, she gets one strike. After that, punishment time. Good luck!|`|dzyJw0cvaa	i really liked that answer: having your child pay YOu to do the cleaning!  bravo!!I cant wait to try that one!!      I was going to say take away the privelages because that is the BEST way to make them really understand that what they are doing is wrong.    My daughter is 6 and we use the time outs fairly regularly.  i do think it is possible to use time outs with a nine year old too.  Just tell them to go to their room for a moment and then talk to them about what just happened.  My daughter already does all the same stuff yours is doing...its amazing how soon the attitude begins!!|`|0dqfwKk7aa	I think you should sit down with her and set rules/expectations.... have her set her own rules/expectations.. Like---- I must clean my room on such days.  But, also set consequences if she doesn't follow through. Like- If I don't clean my room such days I can't watch tv in my room.  So, you would just unplug her tv and remove it from her room.     The key point here is that you MUST follow through with the consequences or else it'll be a waste of time. It might be a little tough to begin with, but if you are consistent she'll learn.  Also, it is important to praise and reward your daughter.  I'm not saying buy her an expensive cell phone... but little things like, you can have a friend over for a sleep over at the end of the month if you've kept your room clean all month.  Be creative, ask her input, so that she feels like she has a say in setting boundaries.      Pick your battles.  If it really  REALLY... really... bothers you that she rolls her eyes, then, make a big deal out of it. But, if it doesn't then ignore it, or do it back to her.  Sometimes kids will do things because they know they can get a response out of you.    Good luck and I'm glad you are trying to find ways to discipline her without getting physical.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Pick your battles. In our house, swearing is not acceptable, saying rude things and calling people names is not acceptable. She's most likely rolling her eyes, ect. for attention and you should simply ignore it. I believe the punishment should fit the crime. Give her a specific time a day, everday, that her room needs to be clean by, and if it isn't clean, she loses a privlege. Dirty looks,eye rolling, and tone(if the words are okay), can be ignored. She may be upset about the fact that you're giving her orders, and you need to let her know that the rude gestures don't change anything.|`|jkgl9WMgaa	responding to the others advice for time-out:  Time-out is a good idea, but when you are disciplining a child, sending them to their room doesn't necessarily work.  How is it punishment if I get to go to my own room, with all my own favorite things and hang out for awhile?  I would try another less comfortable/fun place in the home.  For one of my children, I would make her sit on the stairs on the third step.  She could not see the tv or anything going on in the house but she could hear it.  She had to sit quietly until I came to get her.|`|FAv1RYe6aa	NIP IT NOW! No, you don't want to get physical. Its the wonderful age were they know everything and trust me, it doesn't stop there.  Be  consistent, When she gets out of line, simply tell her to go to her room, because you don't like the ugly talk. She can come out when her mood is calmer. Do the same with the eye rolling...URG! I hate that.  In a stern voice, tell her that you will not tolerate that and tell her to go to her room for 10 min. and she best be in a better mood and if she's not she can stay in her room until she is.  With the forgetting, make out a chore chart for her to follow everyday. there will be no excuse then when she has it right there.  Good Luck|`|Ddw87Jg0aa	If you worked for a company and did something bad you would get suspended or they would take your pay,what the company is saying to the employee is ,we`re not going to tolerate your behavior. With your 9 year old you need to sit and discuss the actions with them and make sure they understand explain to them that the next time it acures that things will be taken from them for an indefinite time or probation confinement to your room,be firm,you are the parent.|`|7ygicWvzaa	Get in her face eye to eye, speak straight and stern and let her know you will not tolerate it (do this everything she pulls this stunt).  She does it because you have allowed her to get away with it from day 1 or you speak to "nice" to her so she doesn't take you seriously.  Watch a few episodes of Nanny 911 and you'll see what you are in for if you don't rectify the problem now.    At 13 this type of problem magnifies 100 times.    My 9 year old tried that mess one time...I got in her face (about scared her) and let her no that I would not tolerate it.  I haven't had a problem since and quite frankly she appreciates it because she respects me for taking a stand.    The other key is consistency.  They will continue to test you to see if you are STILL serious.  All it takes is one time to drop your rules and they got you.|`|qAV9nediaa	woop her Whoooop herr then tell her u love her
OrKpKxkHaa	Maybe you could tell her to choose 4 or 5 close friends and take them out for the day. Go get pedicures (about $7 each for kids), go to the movies, go bowling, go out to lunch or dinner....just the girls. Or you can go to the mall and buy some cool accesories (sunglasses, big bracelets, scarves, hats, etc), grab some disposable cameras and run around a park taking "glamour shots" of eachother and then have a picnic. I love doing special things with my 7 year old. It makes her feel included like the grownups and helps us bond as mother and daughter but we get to act like friends. Good luck!|`|Mgncbxg7aa	maybe like a sleepover or a makeover party   maybe go to a adventure park|`|gT80ocBwaa	My 10 year-old stepdaughter loves Club Libby Lu,  where girls can get makeovers,  dress up, and pretend to be Hannah Montana or anyone from High School Musical.  They sponsor parties and there are 6 locations in Georgia:  2 in Kennesaw,  2 in Alpharetta, and 2 in Douglasville (depending on where you live).  You can bring in a cake and refreshments and the store will do the rest.  The girls will have a blast,  and you will save on decorations.  Most locations are in shopping malls, so check around for a location, or look them up and give them a call.  Where I live (Missouri),  party prices depend on the number of kids and types of perks.  They have special prices for birthday party packages.|`|4CMQuJgOaa	Ok we have all girls in our family so let me throw some ideas out there      Maybe let her pick 2 or 3 close friends and take them for manicures/pedicures and then lunch or dinner.

1STWV53Aaa	Perhaps your child is overwhelmed by the number of kids around him and is seeking attention, but in a negative way. It is important for the teacher to give him positive attention in the classroom, to call him out when he is being good or quiet and listening.    It is also very important to let your child know that there are consequences for his behavior--both good consequences and bad ones. Verbally praise him when it is obvious he is trying to be a good boy. But also let him know that in addition to positive consequences there can be negative ones as well. At age 6, these consequences should be very clear and should stay the same while he is young. An example of a negative consequence may be some alone time. Be creative.    When you discuss today's events with him, speak to him at eye level--get on your knees or have him on the couch with you and be very straightforward with him.Ask him how school was, was he a good boy and if he says no, bravo! He is being honest. Thank him for being honest. If he says yes, tell him that you spoke with the teacher and she said that he did some things that weren't very nice to the other students. Even though he is six, he knows when he has done something bad. Explain to him that you will be checking in with the teacher and will be receiving reports about his behavior, and if he is a good boy all day and listens to the teacher, there will be a positive consequence, how about more time with mom at the park? Well, its a start...|`|IUgkylWqaa	If he started a new school in the middle of the year, then he's probably misbehaving because you took him out of his comfort zone from the old school. Talk with him and find out what his feelings are. Maybe you can find other ways to ease this transition, or put him back in the old school.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Of course punishing him is the answer, what kind of statement is that? You punish them so they WON'T do it again, it's when they don't get punished that they repeat the behavior. Take away something important to him until he improves his behavior at school. A different environment is no excuse for inappropriate behavior. Every time he acts out, take something away whether it's the weekly Pizza night or his TV time or his favorite toy, nothing is off limits to be taken away and stick to it. Don't give it back later on tonight just because he promises he'll do better, call the teacher tomorrow and ask if his behavior was any better for the day, only then should you even think of letting him off the hook.|`|bmoCpcdraa	ok  dont punish him take him to therapy and the social worker will come to your house for a visit if he gets real bad they will pull him out of school and he will have to go to alternitive school or maybe a foster home down the road  if you cant teach him right from wrong than someone else will dont have to be a friend grow up be a parent|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Talk to him about his behavior.  He might be feeling lonely or miss his old friends/school.  Tell him if he doesn't act right you will come to school and monitor him.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	yeah don't punish him now leave that to the proper authorities when he grows up to commit crimes because he doesn't know right from wrong because his mother didn't understand what a parents role in a child's life is and while your at it why don't you just encourage his bad behavior let him watch whatever he wants on television(cause you wouldn't want to censor his ability to learn from adult programming) and what if he starts to smoke?you would let him?and of course bullying other kids would be ok with you,cause you wouldn't want to hinder his social development.Well be prepared to be embarrassed when child services comes to your house because he is out of control   so if he brought a gun home you would just let him?with no consequences?well when he grows up to be a monster you can just blame everyone else.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I would try and find out what is bothering him. He is probably upset that he had to leave his friends and is trying to find his place in this new environment. You should talk to him gently and ask him about the kids in his class, his teacher, the activities. Act really excited when he tells you little things like that they let him get pizza for lunch or he got picked as line leader. Get him excited about his new school. Do it every day for at least a week. After the first talk, let him know that doing those things (be specific)  are not nice and it will be really hard to make friends if he continues. Tell him that you do not approve of spitting in any sense and you will find out if he continues. Good luck!
jTHA0GEdaa	My husband and I adopted a baby boy on Sept. 1, 2008. He was only two days old when he went home from the hospital with us. He's now five months old and he's fantastic!! Here are some things to think about:    1. Do you want to adopt internationally or domestically (or from USA which may be more like a domestic adoption)?    2. If you adopt domestically or from the USA, what kind of adoption would you be more comfortable with: closed, semi-open, or open? Most adoptions these days are semi-open, which means no personal information is exchanged with the birth parents, but the agency facilitates pictures/letters sent between the two parties. Closed adoptions are rare and open adoptions are rare too, but are becoming more common.     3. Do you want a newborn or are you open to having an older infant or toddler? If you choose to go internationally then the baby will most likely be at least 4 months old, probably more like 6 months.     4. You have to be honest about what you and your husband are comfortable with related to different birth parent situations or issues related to the baby. For instance, are you willing to consider a baby whose mother used some amount of drugs or alcohol? Are you willing to consider a baby with developmental issues that are already known during pregnancy? It is o.k. if you are not, you just have to be honest about these things.    5. Ask the agency what their policies are regarding the birth plan for a domestic birth. Will there be a social worker from the agency at the hospital? Is the family allowed to be present at the hospital if the birth mother requests your presence?    6. Ask the agency if they only serve women who come to their agency or if they are connected to a more national search for women?    I'm sure there are many more things I could write, but this might help a little.|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	Hello,  I adopted in Ottawa. We went thru CAS. I would suggest keeping that option open. There are many children in Ontario that need homes and are in foster care as I type this. These kids really need loving families.   We were placed with a sibling group, ages 3 and 18 months. They are now 4 and 6. I cannot express to you how much I love them.   Also start doing your research about adoption, open adoptions, issues that adopted children go through, etc. I also suggest taking a bit of time before you adopt, to really look deep with in yourself, and make sure that you have grieved the fact that you could not get pregnant. Adoption is not an answer to infertility. It is a method in which children should be able to have a family, who would otherwise have none. If you have questions, please feel free to email me.|`|e5zOkZqIaa	What they are going to do is interview both of you, check your house to make sure it is safe, and then decide if there is a need to go forward.    I think what you need to ask is if the agency is going to try to set you up to adopt, and not for foster care.  If you have your heart set up on adopting, don't let them persuade you to become foster parents.  Being a foster parents means that you will most likely have your heart broken at least once.  They tell you they just want to try different kids with you to see if you may be able to adopt them one day...  Bull ****.  They only are trying to deceive you because it is harder to find foster parents than it is for adoptive parents, and it only takes some relative to show up to get the child taken from you even if it has been living with you for a couple years, and you may never get to see them again.    Expect there to be a cost for them to do the homestudy if they haven't told you about it yet.  It is usually 1000-2000 dollars.    Depending on what child you're looking for... boy/girl, infant, toddler, school aged child, etc., ask them approximately how many other people are seeking the same child you are.    Expect several rejections before getting to even meet a potential child.  When our family was considering adoption, we had our homestudy sent in for several children, and another family was picked.  They will usually update you after you send it in and tell you how many other families are being considered.    For example, one time we sent in a homestudy for a toddler.  They called and said they received it but were reviewing about 50 families, they narrowed it down to like 5-10 and told us we were still in, then narrowed it down to 2 and said they would be having a final meeting.  The other family was selected.    If you are adopting a baby don't count on it being a short process, you'll have plenty of competition.      Expect them to do a background check, fingerprint check, and credit check.  A bad credit score indicates irresponsibility and not enough means to support a child.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	I would do some online research about the adoption agency that you plan to work with.  In the USA, there is the better business bureau...  bbb.com.  Just do a general search on them online and see what comes up.  Best wishes.|`|4ilM2hCwaa	There are online adoption sites you can check out for an idea on what such agencies ask prospective parents.  One such  http://www.allforchildren.org/guide.html  provides a FAQ, qualifications, as well as  adoption stories.  Maybe it'll help.|`|pQNB5h8Taa	hi there,im from the uk,so obviously things are different here.i just wanted to tell you that im adopted and so is my big sister.  my mum and dad tried for many years to fall with no luck.  adoption rules are very strict here,they analyize everything,but as long as you and your husband are good honest people it will happen for you:)  after my mum and dad adopted me and my sister,unbelievably my mum fell pregnant!  i just wanted to say you are doing a great thing,any adopted child has a great feeling that they are truly wanted and i feel special and lucky to have been adopted.  just hang in there:-)  good luck to you both and im sure you will have a child of your own soon.

We're just thankful he is not a slob,  and is willing to pick up after himself and others!  I believe it's a phase,  especially if he is still practicing his walking and is more comfortable crawling.  Don't take it personally,  he'll grow out of it.  He thinks of it as a game and the vacuum cleaner is a toy.  Just enjoy it while it lasts as your "little helper" before he learns that it is more fun to MAKE the messes and not so much fun to clean-up.|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Well how old is he? My grandma has a very small hand broom and dust pan it was a decoration really and when my youngest was about 3-5 she would spend our whole visit loading the dust pan with bits of things off the carpet just like that. She also finds things and saves them and remakes them into something else it is amazing the things she sees on the ground everywhere we go that no one else would notice. I say it is just her mind always working and thinking, she is very smart as well.|`|WsUbST6maa	My 2nd son loved the hoover when he was around a year until around 2 and half.

My son waddled over and sat with it hugging it.  He had been without a hoover for over ten days.    He has grown out of it now.    Like someone said, they mimic adults' behaviour.

I know its a classic symptom, fear of contamination...but he might just like playing with lint.  It does sound terribly cute.  When I was little-tiny, I picked up rocks and one time tried to eat fall leaves. I wouldn't worry about this behavior unless he does it all the time  instead of playing or even looking at other people.  If he doesn't make eye contact or look at you when you say his name, its a sign he could be autistic.  Autistic kids are prone to obsessions...his could theoretically be lint...?

The Hank Zipzer series by Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver are also great. They're about a dyslexic boy named Hank Zipzer and his friends, Frankie and Ashley. They're funny and interesting. The first five books in the series are "Niagara Falls, or Does It?" "I Got a 'D' in Salami," "Day of the Iguana," "Zippity Zinger," "The Night I Flunked My Field Trip."

OwEZCpenaa	Children are very sensitive beings. When they refuse to do homework and start lying to teachers and parents red flags go up.  Is he Dyslexic, is he ADD, is he emotionally stressed by what's going on at home. Negative attention is better than no attention at all. Children by nature want to please us but they need constant affirmation that they are special, wonderful and loved. They need to be taught how to study and how important it is to do well in school. Try structuring one hour after school to do homework together. Taking away privileges removes the distractions and increases respect for those pleasures.    Try turning off the T.V. and read to him or have him read to you.  Make it your special time together. Parents are the greatest teachers our children have. Investing time with them is investing in their future. Best of luck.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Ask the teacher when homework is going to be set. Get her to give you a set of really boring worksheets. Every time he comes home and says he has no homework when you know it's been set (you can always confirm this by ringing another parent) he can do a boring worksheet or two instead. Be sure this involves more work than his actual homework would have been.|`|bmoCpcdraa	1 hour a day at table if no homework than they must read still 1 hour a day no tv in background works for mine no radio|`|C0GeEv7kaa	You need to get with the teacher to come up with a fail-safe way to guarantee your child gets his homework done. You could get some type of planner for your son and have his teacher write his assignments in it and when they're due and when he doesn't have any homework she could simply write a note in the planner saying so.|`|eya1WDS4aa	First i would say calm down. before you start taking things away you should see  if he is just being lazy or if there is a problem. What i mean by problem is , is he understand the work, is there any problems going on in school like bullying, him not being well liked. Has there been a big change in the home recently? When i was 9 my parents go a divorce and i started slipping on my home work then kids started making fun of me and that got me or uninvolved. You should see first if there is an issue behind why he isnt. If there is no issue and he is just being lazy then start taking things away, tv games ect. and make him read or have the teacher print you off a bunch of worksheets for him to do.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	My son has an agenda, ( a day planner), he puts his homework duties for the day in there.

Let him come home, have a snack and a play. Then sit with him and go through the homework and make sure he understands it. Give help when asked for it. Homework should just be a revision of work done at school and go for no longer than 15-20 minutes.   Find out why he lied, it may be he just doesn't understand the work and figures it is worth the punishment to just not try it.

Aidan is too common; I would avoid that one as a first name, even though your last name is extremely rare. Since your last name is extremely rare, don't use Ishaq for a first name, because it will make your child's name too unique. Zachary is a great choice for the first name because it's familiar in the US, it gives your child a familiar but not hugely common first name.

5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not myself, but because of my PCOS, it's something I am continually checked for. If the uterine lining thickens, a D&C is the most common thing to do. However, when I had the vaginal ultrasound, my uterine lining was fine so I didn't need to go through with one.  I started doing lots of reading here, but there's tons of info, so I'll just give you the link to my search -  http://www.google.ca/search?q=causes+of+...    It may also depend upon what type of birth control you were on -  "This thickening can be due to hormonal imbalance or to taking estrogen without a progesterone medication as well; estrogen causes the uterine lining to proliferate and become thick and lush, while progesterone thins out the lining; a balance between these two hormones is necessary to ensure regular, moderate periods."  http://www.wellsphere.com/wellpage/uteri...    If you are not sure of the diagnosis, please go see another doctor for another opinion.|`|6JHyLgsAaa	Basically what happens is they go in and scrape down your uterine walls, this is why you're getting it, because your walls are built up.    Don't be scared, they will put you on a drug that actually helps you forget the pain (what its supposed to do) and its over in no-time.  good luck!|`|Brqd1YcDaa	my first d&c was becouse of problems not becouse of m/c|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I almost had to have this when I was in my teens because I had such bad periods. Thank God they tried birthcontrol first but it isnt un-heard of. A lot of people just think of it when they think of a woman miscarrying.
TSQxwlbraa	What state|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	www.early-advantage.com  The Muzzy Language programs, there are all sorts of foreign languages to choose from. It's a little expensive but if you think of the pay off it could have when she's older it's worth it. You could even learn along with her.
kv8ZFPP1aa	your dr should've told you a estimated date of when you conceived according to your due date.|`|Xlb8QPj9aa	From your birth date, count back approximately 9.2 months.    Oops, I thought that you meant you. Lol. ; )|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	and 14 days from your period date.. Then the doctors do measure for the size of the baby, But its a guess.|`|hX7wGgjjaa	your ob/gynecologist should had you brief on that that a long time ago.i just wonder if you go to your monthly check-up?. we (my wife and i)know the exact date she conceive a little more than two mos.and when the ob told us the day,i remember that day well.so there's no denying that her baby wasn't mine.don't get fooled by your menstruation period.|`|s8SnVmXvaa	Well, if you can remember what days you had sex before that date, then there's a chance you can pinpoint the exact day.  What you should have done is the day you found out you were pregnant you should have sat down and tried to figure out what days you had sex.  It'll be a lot harder now.
ZdeJCdCbaa	It does sound like a tough time. The most important thing I would do is emphasize on how bad and rude it is to say things of that nature. Maybe make him write an apology letter to the girls/parents and the school. Other then that you've done everything I would probably do if my child said something like that. Maybe get him to do some community service around your neighborhood. My parents had my pick up the neighbors dog dung for a month because I got into a fight. I had a lot of time to think. And keep him away from that boy and maybe talk to the kids parents? I hope it helps a little. good luck|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	How about turning all this negativity into something more positive? Kids are more likely to utilize the values and morals taught to them at home when they see them in action and see their parents living those values, too. You might consider finding a once weekly volunteering opportunity for you and your son (and rest of the family if applicable) to engage in. Since he seems to think it's funny to say inappropriate things to girls, maybe a domestic violence shelter. There are all sorts of things that non profit agencies need volunteers for; prepping mailings, creating posters for community education, sorting through donations, gathering donations. He's probably even old enough to help out at a soup kitchen. It would be a good experience for him to learn how to interact and help people and a good time for the two of you to talk about what's important for you as a family and what you see is important for him as he becomes a man and having respect for all people.|`|AA10475412	Have you tried time-outs, such as standing in the corner? That might work if you haven't done so.|`|Nx4mJZVxaa	sing him a song to calm him down|`|NIEt2CEZaa	Well you could ask him what he would do if somebody talked to you that way. And make sure you listen to his answer. Try to let him do most of the talking and try to find out where his head is at. Also if there is a video about sexual harrasment online that is appropriate for his age have him watch it. Let him know you still love him but that you are concerned about that kind of behavior and that you want to help him how to learn how to talk and treat a lady because your a lady too.
kv8ZFPP1aa	very low. so don't stress about it.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Very low, assuming that was the only time you took your pill late.|`|ODZeyNYMaa	Very slim. Two methods of birth control and he pulled out is pretty fool proof. Are you in the habit of taking your pill not on time? If you do not take it the way you are supposed to your chances of getting pregnant go up, but other than that, you should be fine.   Good Luck!|`|jM3rk7aQaa	100%, trick.|`|s8SnVmXvaa	I don't think you're pregnant.  If you've been taking the pill for a while, missing a day or two shouldn't get you pregnant.  Though if you quit for a week or two, your chances are excellent.

01Mu3wUeaa	I'm sorry but how do you "accidentally" or "not mean" to sleep with somebody? lol    Anyways, If Ryan signs the birth certificate at birth, that is considered fraud.    Ryan isn't the biological father.Nate is.    Does Nate even want to be the dad? if not, he can sign over his rights to Ryan if he doesn't want to be the father.    Nevertheless, the baby deserves to know his/her father and paternal family.    Good luck with the story.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think you misunderstand how naming works.    The baby isn't born yet, right? He/she doesn't have a last name. Nessa can give baby whatever last name she likes - hers, Nate's, Ryan's, her mum's maiden name, Higginbotham-Smythe... it's entirely up to her. There is nothing to solve. She just puts Ryan's name as the baby's last name on the certificate. It's irrelevant who's listed as the father - or who is the father.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Nessa will be married to Ryan (and probably have Ryan's last name) when the baby is born.  Therefore, the baby is legally Ryan's and will carry his last name, unless they are already divorcing.  No one has to change anything.  Ryan would also be listed on the birth certificate as the father.  Now, as to whether they'd want to tell the baby someday . . . .|`|2FUjIpZKaa	Won't they be married before the baby is born?  If the mom changes her name before the baby is born the baby could have the mom's name.|`|ubf26k2Oaa	I live in uk and recently registered my baby's birth. The registrar told me that i could call my baby whatever i liked, the fathers name didn't matter and I didn't even have to use my last name if i didn't want.  (My query came about because, although married, I never took my husbands name and i was worried that legally the baby would have to have my husbands surname.)|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	You can call the baby what you want but the Ryan must not be the father on the birth certificate.  It can be Nate as long as he goes to the register office with Nessa.    By the way, how did they sleep together by accident?
ubf26k2Oaa	I'm sure it would speed things up, but I think its a bit risky...why not let nature take its course or try something less harsh.  Eating fresh pineapple, eating a curry or drinking raspberry leaf tea.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Castro oil will do nothing but give you a case of the runs.  If you want to assist things in coming along, try cohosh, orgasms etc.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Iv heard really bad things about castor oil. I was over due and did some Research and decided against it. all the best|`|VEi3R0craa	this is a very dangerous option be careful doing this it can dehydrate you cause stomach pains not related to labor and cause sever diarrhea.  I would not do it.  I know how it is in the end but please let nature take its course.  it will be over soon|`|vVfMcrooaa	I heard if you eat a big piece of pizza it will work, the saying suggests that you have a beer with it.  I would never suggest that, so maybe a coke and a slice of pizza.|`|XCrze4x8aa	Don't use Castor Oil. Really. Its dangerous and unnecessary. If the OB says you can start taking measures to speed things along, then you can try walking, cleaning the house, intercourse, etc. FYI: as soon as my dr. gave me the all-clear I did all of these things and my water broke within 36 hrs...and safely, too.
2xS1Jro7aa	She is not to younge! I started to have sleep overs with friends (parents were friends with their parents) when I was 5!|`|zQB0kEmcaa	10 is not too young.  Kids love to sleep over.  If you know the girl and the parents and trust them, then let her go.  She will have fun and you will  get a break...|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	I don't think so, for a single overnighter...this is the best time for them.  Even better if you know the parents.    Only don't let her go if you think the parent are not very good at parenting their own.  Even if you don't know them go and meet with them a couple days before, you will get a vibe if good or bad.|`|U12kQCD4aa	If there's going to be as adult there then surely it is fine and safe.  If they are trusted to hang out by day then really there shouldn't be a problem for the night,especially since you're friends with the girls mom.  He probably just doesn't like seeing his little girl growing up fast but we need "arms to cradle them,and wings to let them fly"|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Definitely NOT too young.  Girls this age are always having sleepovers.  If you know the parents and trust that the girls will be safe, there's nothing to worry about!  Enjoy your evening sans child!  :)|`|C4ibOR7Laa	omg no!!! shes not young, shes 10!!!! i had my first sleep over when it was my friends 6th birthday party|`|3URupc7caa	I dont think she is my sister is 10 and she stays at her friends all the time and her friends stay here, i never really thought about it until now, seems normal to me :D|`|zHRWklEWaa	Not really, many people start sleep overs in kindergarten or first grade.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	No, I don't think she is too young. At lot of girls start having slumber parties at like 5 years old. Just remember, kids that are too sheltered are often the ones who rebel. I'm one of those kids, so I know all about it. Let her go!|`|AA11097657	I used to stay at my friends house when I was 5.    He is wrapping her up in cotton wool.  What does he think is going to happen to her?    She needs to be able to do these things or she will grow up to be clingy and not independent.    He is one with the problem.|`|mxtWuadraa	I remember my first ever sleepover at the grand old age of 4 at my best friends house!! We had good parental supervision, had a set bed time and really enjoyed ourselves!! I remember her dad read us the first ever Harry Potter book, before any of the others came out. And we were only 4! (very intellectual 4 year olds.. it must be said!)    but I don't think she's too young at all. I agree, you must maintain a decent level of discipline, (and that's coming from a 16year old!) but not so much that you smother her! They'll be under parental supervision, you know the mum, you know the friend (well, I assume  you do!) so trust her and let her have a great time!     =D|`|J6vPhmmLaa	Nope, I don't think it is to young. I started sleeping at my friends houses when I was 10. Eventhough I would sleep at my cousin's and my parents friends house's way before that!!!  I think FORESURE she should be able to sleep there, and no she is not to young:)|`|UMRdHuuVaa	It all depends i guess, if you know the family etc - and know they are responsible people etc i probably wouldnt mind.  But i dont think i started doing sleep overs til i was about 12 - but that was because i lived so far out of town etc.|`|2N4j1ficaa	no sleep overs as long as parents are there are fine|`|JmD0oq2Naa	no she is not too young to have a sleep over at her friends. i was about 8 when i had my first sleep over|`|DNygQdmVaa	I don think so. Ten is not very young, an its a girl.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	Oh I think that's perfectly fine! I certainly did at that age, and so did all my girly friends!    I'll let my daughter in a few years too. She's 5 right now.    If she's local, and you're friends with her mum, then she can call you if there's a problem.    10 really isn't that young.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no way:) if you know the mum and feel shell be safe there i dont see the harm at all:)|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Heck no, she is NOT too young.  My kids were doing sleepovers from 5 yrs old when they started kindergarten.  It is good for them for you to let go a little and let them do this kind of thing.  They need to learn some independance from you.|`|96ndKQncaa	Not young at all!|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	There is nothing wrong with it at all.|`|AA11738376	angels have to spread their wings.  think 10 is just the right age. xxxx|`|0WstfAmzaa	I was never allowed to go to sleepovers, and while I resented it a bit when I was younger, I thank my parents now.  I was always allowed to have people stay over at my house tho.      I don't think it's an age thing, but whether or not you feel comfortable with what is going on and that you can trust your child will be in safe hands.    Talk it over again with your husband and ask him to explain why he doesn't want her to go, other than her being too young.  If he has valid points don't dismiss it.  When you've made the final decision, talk to your daughter about it, explaining why she is or isn't allowed to go.  If she is allowed to go, tell her what is expected of her, and what she should do if she feels uncomfortable or in any danger.      Not to be a cynic, but the world is full of crazy people - and most of them seem really normal.|`|10mOwk0Taa	No, she's not too young.  Too young to go to the mall alone maybe, but for a sleepover, no.  I was 6 or 7 when I had my first sleepover!|`|DPegPYRPaa	I was having sleepovers and going to sleepovers at 6-7 too. It isn't too young as long as parents supervise!|`|SAVkfNs4aa	if the other girls parents are there then its completely fine|`|FiUprYsvaa	I take it you are talking about a sleepover.  She more than old enough.  Sleepovers start at 7 or 8ish years of age.|`|R5ILa4Imaa	No she is not to young. My girls all went on sleep overs at primary school and now all mt grandsons  go on them. their ages are 9,10,12. They have been sleeping over for years and their friends sleep in their houses.|`|XtudJ1dXaa	Er no.  Why would she be too young whats wrong with it? I slept over at my friends house about then. It's not as if theyre gonna like have sex or whatever is it so|`|n7uoE9wmaa	She is well old enough for a sleepover|`|lFVbACCwaa	I went on my first sleepover when I was about 6-7!|`|BcrYBSJmaa	I remember having my first sleepover when I was about 6 or 7, I think she's definitely ready, especially seeing as you trust the friend's mother.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	if you trust the friends family, yes, youve got to let her go at some time or the other, her dads just worried about her safety, talk it through with the other kids parents and then decide|`|o8ROmRbAaa	no. let her go have fun!!!|`|kw80YHMLaa	not at all, she is def old enough my 7 year old and 4 year nieces stay at friends houses and vice versa.|`|2c4c1ed4956562c692dc58b8de0f77d8aa	Is your step-dtr's mother still "in the picture"?  What does she say?  My own daughter (now 33 yrs old and a mother herself) was about 8 or 9 years old when she started spending the night at her friends' houses.  It helped that her friends all lived within a few blocks of our home and the families all knew each other through school functions.    Daddies always think their daughters are too young ... for anything!  Would it help him feel more comfortable if the friend stayed at your house one night, then your step-dtr could stay at the friend's house the next night?  When does he think she would be old enough for "sleep-overs"?|`|iHkbrJF1aa	10 is not too young, my son went on his first sleepover when he was 7 and enjoyed it, since then we have had his friends round for sleepovers at the weekends in the holidays. Girls is different, they are more mentally mature than boys at that age and like to socialise amongst themselves more, this is normal and she'll really love it.|`|eji2mBAlaa	no way. it is very good for children to spend a night away from home every now n again.  It helps them develop in many areas such as trust and the beginning of independence.    It would be a different story if you didnt know the parents but since you do, it would be a really good experience for your daughter.    Just the one night should be fine.  :)  x|`|1coVkX3qaa	10 isnt 2 young!
YlLdIPRvaa	Clearly your child was crying to avoid taking the nap.  Kids will try to test the limits to see if they can get what they want.  I would have let the child cry it out in bed.  You don't want to get into a power struggle or give into the tantrum by cuddling them.  Sometimes kids get so tired that they seem wide awake.  I think you did the right thing.  Keep up the good parenting work.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	time to get rid of the nap -problem solved!  start calling the hour or 2 after lunch "quiet time" and enforce it for all family members.  dim the lights, close the curtains, and play quietly -read- or listen to music.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I am also one of the Moms that didn't have nap time at 3.   But I would let him cry it out if I did.  He was such a good sleeper at night a nap would ruin that.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I probably would - just for a little bit, because they are just being difficult and trying to get their own way.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	At age 3 yes i would. that is just a tactic to delay nap time. let him scream and shout his way to sleep just make sure he doesn't hurt his self. And once he starts to lay there and behave like he should reward him after the nap for being a big boy.|`|GIqACtxvaa	At that age,  oh heck yeah!   The more you go and do the little "task" the more they ll ask and the longer your problem will go on.  Say its nap time and that's it.  I would tell my daughter "I'm not going to come back in after I tuck you in".  One day of her crying it out taught her.  Di dint take long at all.  Be tough for a few days maybe and you'll be set.      On the other hand your little one may be ready to drop the nap altogether.  You could first try moving it to later in the day.  Perhaps he or she is just not tired anymore at the time they currently go down.|`|caA35sD5aa	Try eliminating everything they can cry about before putting them to sleep, offer a drink, ask if they want the fan on, get a pillow and a toy they want, door open or closed, etc so that when you put them to bed they have nothing to complain about. Put them to bed and then don't make any conversation with them after. If they come out of the room just take them back in without speaking to them. They are just crying for your attention so if you don't give them any they will stop. If they are doing this everyday though it may take a while so just be strong and stick with it.|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Cry it out.  This is so common at nap time for kids. lol   As long as they are not in danger, let them cry.    They need to come to the realization that you are not going to come and bail them out of nap time.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Yeap i would just let them cry untill they fall asleep. And i would keep sticking with naps untill they are in school. :D|`|DPegPYRPaa	I do. My 2 1/2 year old will throw major fits sometimes and throw all the blankets and pillow off her bed etc. I just let her cry it out. I go back in after a while and tuck her in.|`|mppKv11Eaa	Yes! Because, if you allow them to behave that way and THEN give them what they want, they will think that's the way to do things. Let them cry it out because otherwise you will have a spoiled rotten little brat that no one likes. This will probably make it to the point to where they don't care what you say and will do it anyways.|`|9s9Baglyaa	I would try to comfort him or her by giving them a little snack or reading them a book (Dr. Suess is always good). Letting them "cry it out" won't solve anything because he or she will keep doing it over and over.|`|PeMwOrooaa	I would let them cry it out.  At that age children will often cry to get their own way.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I would start the nap time off by taking a few minutes to make CERTAIN everything is acceptable - lighting, fan, drink, potty, pillow etc.... than you calmly tell them it is NAP TIME if they choose to rest and not nap that is ok too but MOMMY Needs a nap time too and this is quiet time.  If they choose to throw a fit and scream & cry mommy will NOT be coming in to help or check on them.  Give them a few books or some quiet toy if that helps.  BY age 3 some kids start NOT NAPPING, but I still made mine go in and try to nap or at least REST because I NEEDED IT TOO!!! LOL    If they choose to cry at age 3 then they are just wanting their own way and you would be allowing them to manipulate you if you didn't let them CRY.

It won't be digested if your baby licks it off; which causes no harm in adults.    The one thing is, that licking chapstick off leads to ones lips being MORE chapped.    If you apply it to the baby's lips several times a day, and he/she licks it off, there may be digestive difficulties.|`|Mx2hzWgTaa	Yes my 2 year old loves it!

z37VN3Qoaa	Cayleigh Leighton Brooks :)|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think the names are beautiful either way, but I would prefer Leighton Caylee Brooks.  Leighton is more original and Caylee is pretty popular right now.  I would also change the spelling of Caylee becuase you have "leigh" in both the first and the middle name and it looks a tad strange.  But again the name is gorgeous either way, its just my opinion|`|bIaywrBCaa	Cayleigh Leighton Brooks|`|SxlJDkDXaa	the second one, is it more original and unique, and pretty.

bd1889c9c1dd0d6cffa6304b6df18023aa	First I'd do what works best for my child. (one of my children responds well to shame and guilt. He has a lot of empathy and a good conscience. the other one has a more self-centered philosophy to things and her punishment is usually more strict because she doesn't weigh others feelings as a priority in deciding to do something.)    So if it were my son, it would involve a small "lecture" about what made his actions wrong and how it affects things along with encouragement that he is a better person than that and needs to fix whatever wrong he did (make amends) and not do it again.    If it were my daughter I would have a similar lecture but it would have physical consequences like groundings or paying back whatever she broke or messed up.|`|AA11210211	Depends on the crime!! lol Normally it's time out first then I start taking toys away.|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	We have a chastisement sequence.  The goal is to teach the child that behaviors have consequences and that they will have to make restitution.  When my DD hit a baseball through the neighbor's window, I paid for it immediately so the neighbor could replace it.  I then required my DD to work off the debt in a reasonable time frame.  If an offense is one of the few that merits a spanking, we send the child to his room so we will be cool and calm when we get there in a few minutes.  We explain why his action was wrong, and that he will be spanked as a result.  The spanking is given with a switch, on average 1 lick per year of age.  After all has calmed down the child apologizes to the person he wronged (hit baby sister without adequate provocation).  If restitution is required, he does so.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	i would go through with the punishment i guess.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	i don't -i use discipline.  "the punishment must fit the crime".
BAyW22qjaa	Hey babe, Im sorry about your lost. When i miscarried Dec 08, 2008 I was 6weeks 5days. I bleed for a week (mostly spotting) and then my period returned Jan 15. Right now im having mild cramping (2weeks before next expected period) and I have my fingers crossed. I have reason to believe this not my month, but im still trying to be positive.  Hopefully this is a Good month for us both.   ~Baby Dust~|`|6bc1daa67c2e712a9d1fdf83a2a7f067aa	I had 2 miss carriages in a row  after my first D&C I got pregers exactly 3- months later  and also miss carried thats the waiting time my OB gave me so your uterus can recover properly then I had another one with the second one I wanted to wait so we waited 6 months  then we got pregnate with our daughter. So good luck take lots of Vitamins and relax|`|tWOQ8Upeaa	I had my d&c 2nd july got my period 6 weeks later then got another 1 2 weeks after that.

Lots of baby dust hun and i hope we get our BFPs soon xx|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	I miscarred  at 5 1/2 weeks preg around December 25th.   I got my regular period on Jan 28th.  This was VERY EARLY for me.  Since my cycles are normally longer (35 to 40 in legnth), I would have not expected my period to start until at least Feb 2nd (almost a week difference), but I knew that is when my period should come because I BBT chart, and I knew I'd ovulated 14 days prior to the 28th.   I was hoping to conceive again right away, but I didn't.   My husband had a cold though, when I was at my most fertile and didn't want to give me his cold.  I got it anyway.   We'll be trying again this month.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It took 3 months for me to get pregnant again after a miscarriage. I wasn't having a regular period.

x2OY83fPaa	my son will be 3 in may. he stopped drinking a bottle when he was about 1 1/2. it wasnt easy. still now he wont drink out of a sippy cup unless the stopper thing is of so it can just come out and he doesnt have to suck it. i just took it away a little bit at a time. first he could only have it at meals and bedtime. then only bedtime. eventually he didnt want it anymore. now i just need to tackle potty training...LOL.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Yes, he needs to be off the bottle. My daughter was off before 13 months. Just make it a game and throw them in the garbage and then tell him he is a big boy now. He will use the sippy cup if he is thirsty. And if he asks, remind him you throw them away. Try making it up and pack them all up in a box and tell him Santa needs bottles to pass around for babies! Maybe he will like that idea more!|`|O2fXBvB2aa	3 yrs old is way to old for a bottle and children are not even supposed to drink a bottle to fall a sleep.  You need to just take the bottle away cold turkey.  Trying to ween your child off it will just make it worse.  The first day will be the worst but once your child see you wont give in it will get better.  I suggest doing it on a friday night since your child only goes to bed with the bottle.  It will take allot longer  for him to go to sleep and that way you will have the weekend for him to get used to it|`|0ayP21R9aa	that is not very good....next time he asks for his bottle give him a sippy cup instead...if he starts to cry and scream just let him...it may take awhile for him 2 stop  and it will be painful for you 2 watch as he looks like hes in pain..but he will eventually notice that yur not watchin and will stop.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Your son is WAY too old for bottles. I see this on Super Nanny and Nanny911 all the time where the parents don't fully take the bottle away, they find it easier to give in than to deal with the child wanting the bottle. If you give it a few days, I'm sure he'll take the sippy cup, he won't let himself go without milk for too long. He just knows if he throws a fit he gets his way.|`|hiD30bDraa	A 3 year old only do what you allow if you get rid of the bottle he will cry then get over it. And he can really mess up his teeth if you continue to give it to him. Let him cry he will get over it.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Just take the bottle away cold turkey. It will be difficult for both you and your son for a few days atleast, but thats really the only way.  I saw this once on supernanny and this is what she recommended. What you can do, is take the bottle and put it in a large envelope and put a pretend address on it. Tell your son that you are mailing it to a little baby who really needs it, as bottles are for babies only, not big boys. If you don't get him off the bottle soon his teeth are going to become crooked and if you are giving him anything other than water, you have tooth decay to worry about.   Best of luck!|`|TiS89hj1aa	Throw all the bottles and bottle accessories out.  Buy sippy cups only.  trust me i did this with my son he cried for the first couple of days but then realized their were no more bottles and gave into the sippy cups.  It also helps if you buy cups with your son's favorite character|`|sw2R5A9iaa	if the child has an oral or mental disability, a bottle may be fine.  if your child is normal, toss the bottles in the trash.|`|ojEkgJoqaa	try to take the bottle away and maybe put his favorite character from a cartoon on it or something he likes. they should be weened off at one because it is not good for their teeth all the sucking.|`|DKqsFGymaa	Kids are usually weened from a bottle at the age of one year, so you need to get your son off the bottle.  At 3 years old, he's old enough for you to sit down with him and tell him he's too old for a bottle and you have to throw them all away.      It might be hard for a day or two because you've let a bad habit go on way too long, but hang tough and don't give it back to him.  Literally throw them all away so that it's not even an option.    As far as the aunt and her daughter, it's your problem because it's your relative.  I can see her point since both children should not have a bottle anymore.    Good luck.  Tough Love!|`|AA11553531	i would suggest a talk with the boy and steer it to the point where HE will toss the bottle in the garbage himself....then lots of praise for the act and praise when he uses the 'grown up' way to drink from cup/sippy bottle.  it also works for blankets and the like...|`|c5186eac9c2b70e449f12d24a1aaec90aa	Ok I'm not gonna judge or anything but he really needs to be off the bottle, it's so bad for the teeth-decay and can cause them to be crooked. So how to get it away-well there are these sippy cups called nubys that have the silicon tops that may work since they are still soft like the nipple on the bottle, but they are the same shape as a sippy lid. Also there are some with silicon straws. I would trash ALL of the bottles and get him to help explaining he's a big boy and bottles are for little babies. Also get him to come with you to buy the new sippys and make a huge big deal out if it. Make it so fun and so cool. Kids take their cues from parents so if you're excited he'll join in too. Let him pick out some and STICK TO IT. That is the key. It'll probably be harder on you than him. So good luck!!! :)

Get 2 cakes or she if the cake place can do one theme on each side of the cake.  Play games and give out prizes.  Goody bags  are a must.  With my invitations I usually give something that goes with the theme.  For my daughters Tinkerbell party I made bottles of pixie dust and passed those out with the invitations.  Also what ever theme she picks (ie tinkerbell, princess) I buy dolls to use as table center pieces and then after we open presents I have a raffle and raffle them off to the girls.|`|FkPP6NVeaa	For boys I would strongly recommend a small kids gym. It has to be small, so there are no more than two parties simultaneously, otherwise it's too messy, noisy, and even not safe with all the older kids running around. Most girls this age would also enjoy a gym party. For the older girls I would look for a costume party place.  I suggest you to check this website: http://www.toddler-net.com There are many birthday party ideas there.
X6lTuSCyaa	I completely agree that the only way to know for sure is to take a test, and this will also help ease your mind, however, judging by what you have said, I think in very unlikely that you are pregnant.  You mentioned the fact that you used a condom, which still isn't a 100% guaranteed method of birth control...  But also take into consideration the fact that if you had sex on the 30th, and your period was due on the 1st...  it is impossible, you ovulate between days 14-16 or your cycle, day one being the first day of your period....  try a home test, if it comes back negative and your period still hasn't started, go see a doctor, it could just be because of stress, but it could also be something more serious such as a hormone imbalance, or a few other things, I had a very good friend that this happened to, she was three months late before the doctors finally decided that she should have blood tests done to check her hormones, and she had sever imbalances....  I hope this helps a little....|`|84b26tbzaa	well there is a possipility but before you panic you should wait a little longer. you soul make an appointmennt with your doctor for a blood pregnaancy test because its really early to tell wait another week or so.|`|AA11315360	Well calm down and go to a pharmacy and buy a pregnancy test kit. Any kit. Follow the directions. If it is positive see a doctor asap. If it is negative wait about 3 more days for your period and if it still doesnt come call a doctor and buy another pregnancy test kit.    Stop having sex until you are ready to be a mother OR start taking birth control pills and using condoms!|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I thought I was getting my period when I found out I was pregnant. I would do a HPT just to be safe!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If you used a condom and it didn't break or anything I wouldn't think you are preg. Sounds like it's irregular since you had sex for the first time. That sometimes throws it off. It did for me.     But when I first got pregnant I got cramps really bad, but no period. I took a test and it was positive. (We were planning for it)|`|caA35sD5aa	Being so stressed about thinking you are pregnant is enough to make your period late.  I had a scare when I was 17 and I was soo stressed about it my period was 1 week late, the day I bought a hpt I got my period. Just relax and take a test to be sure.|`|YFPMcHCbaa	I'm really getting sick of seeing this type of question on here. No one here will be able to tell you if you are pregnant.

ddCU9KTWaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IUI. Went through the IUI injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IUI and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.    http://www.indianmedguru.com  You can get much information in this website.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Sounds like this was a good cycle for you, 3 mature follicles & good sperm count.  You triggered on Sunday and had an IUI on Monday?  My doctor always triggers 36 hours before the IUI but you'll probably be fine since sperm can survive for a while inside you.    Good luck to you.
44fde7161b03d265135a97896632d0d6aa	Yes. Make sure you stay on a feeding schedule so he never gets too hungry. I kept a journal of when my kids ate, slept and pooped, so I could recognize a pattern. If you son is gassy, put him on his back, bicycle his legs really fast for about 10 seconds, then bring his knees to his chest and hold for another 5 seconds. This really helps to release gas. Good Luck|`|AA11568652	My mom said I used to do this and scare her and when she told my doctor about it he said not to worry about it, because the worst (but unlikely) thing that would happen would be that I would pass out and start breathing again then.|`|AA12169845	My baby doesnt do that a whole lot but whenever she cries so much that it looks like she needs to take a breath I just blow in her face and that makes her stop and take a breath.|`|68c62dec281a0769fd6743edaa8db815aa	My daughter will be 2 in Sept and still does this when she gets mad.  She was diagnosed with having "Breathe Holding Spells" where she starts to cry, stops making any noise, colapses (passes out), sometimes her whole body stiffens up...but then she'll take a breathe and just like that she is fine.  I freaked out the first couple of times she did this, but it is nothing to worry about.  It is not gonna hurt them or make them less smart or anything of that nature.  It is something that they will grow out of and be a thing of the past.    PS-If he continues to do this when he gets older(like my daughter) and he does it with a temper tantrum say b/c you would not let him have something....do not let him have that something when he comes to b/c he will do it everytime he does not get his way.   Best Wishes.|`|2234003f6af3ff64e02e1133d81f2cb0aa	My daughter did that too sometimes.  Blow in his mouth to startle him into breathing again.|`|AA11974583	One of my twins has a bad temper too.. he does the same thing when he is really pissed off!!  I gently blow in his face and he takes a breath.  Dont worry unless he passes out.|`|537b867276be6a2be9f4aceb55fa0c19aa	it does happen because they get so worked up and they only have tiny lungs try not to let him get worked up|`|AA11760433	Sounds like you baby has gas.  Ensure that he has burped properly after feeding before putting him down.  Put him on your shoulder and gently rub his back, this should help.  My son had the same problem as a newborn, I got scared quite a few times as I could hear the gas in his little chest and sometimes it was a struggle for him to breathe.
53dd34bab3ee7b11c33bc726c289702faa	El ni?opa es la imagen ms venerada de los xochimilcas, su nombre quiere decir ni?o del lugar (pa o pan) y desde hace ms de doscientos a?os innumerables milagros se le atribuyen, de cari?o se le dice el ni?opita o ni?opan.            Desde principios de la evangelizacin a los indios se les inculco el amor a cristo. En Xochimilco particularmente, por cristo ni?o, por lo que existe especial devocin al Ni?o Jess.      En el siglo XVI, Martn Cortes de Alvarado apodado el "viejo", indio muy principal y cacique que haba asimilado la cultura cristiana, funda una capellana cerca de Xochimilco con un ni?o Dios de Colorin el cual fue hecho por manos indgenas Xochimilcas en uno de los talleres artesanales Franciscanos, dentro del Convento de San Bernardino de Siena y otras imgenes, se dice que parte de fervor destinado al Ni?opan se deba a que era "Un se?or de indios". A lo que se debe tambin el cambio de nombre y se sustituye Ni?o Dios por Ni?opa. A la muerte de Corts de Alvarado, ste hereda las imgenes religiosas que estaban a su cargo a un familiar, y a la muerte del familiar ste hereda a otro y as sucesivamente quedando como albaceas de dicha imagen los herederos. Los herederos con el tiempo se convierten en Mayordomos y mozos mayores de las imgenes. Como las comunidades indgenas estaban acostumbradas a obedecer a los mayordomos, mandaban decir misas al Ni?opan y al fundador de la capellana para conseguir milagros.      Se cree que estos son los primeros antecedentes del Ni?opan, la manera de cuidarlo y el origen de sus fiestas.      Revolucin Cristera  (1926)      Durante la revolucin cristera los Xochimilcas escondieron al Ni?opan en tapancos para que los soldados estuvieran frente a la imagen y que esta desapreci de su vista. Con ese poder de desaparecer y aparecer, dicen que por las noches va a la milpa a ver como esta la siembra y que a la ma?ana siguiente la imagen tiene los zapatitos con lodo.      Tambin cuentan que durante la noche visita a los enfermos y se aparece en sue?os y emite mensajes importantes.      La fe con que se venera la imagen los 265 das del a?o, descontando das domingos y otros das muy se?alados es impresinate.      A partir del 2 de febrero hasta el 14 de diciembre visita a los hogares de la comunidad que lo requiere para un milagro; a?o con a?o del 2 de febrero al 2 de febrero del a?o siguiente, un mayordomo previamente designado se hace cargo de l.      Al cambio de mayordoma celebrado en el atrio de la Parroquia de San Bernardino de Siena, asisten ms de 6 mil feligreses.  Jos Reyes Chaparro, sacerdote que tuvo a su cargo la Parroquia de Xochimilco y desconocedor de las tradiciones de Xochimilco, quiso recoger la imagen de la casa del mayordomo responsable y llevarla a la iglesia con los dems santos; ante la negacin del mayordomo, el prroco levant un acta de averiguacin previa en la Procuradura General de la Repblica por la tenencia ilegal del Ni?opa. Durante el tiempo que duro el proceso judicial, el Ni?opan tuvo prohibida la entrada a la Parroquia, los feligreses se vieron obligados a acompa?ar con el culto en parroquias vecinas. El fallo que emitieron las autoridades fu favorable a las costumbres de Xochimilco, bajo la condicin de que en el momento en que la tradicin sea interrumpida, la imagen ser entregada a la Secretara de Patrimonio Nacional por el apoderado de la misma, Fernando Arenas Rosas.  Actualmente hay mayordomos en lista hasta el a?o 2035 y la gente ha tenido que esperar la mayordoma  hasta 50 a?os.     Ser mayordomo, adems delos beneficios espirituales que genera, es honor y prestigio frente al pueblo. Est en lista de espera una pareja casada de 19 a?os y cuando sean mayordomos tendrn casi 60.      La ilusin de tener al Ni?opan durante un a?o implica en 30 o 40 a?os. La vida de la familia que lo cuida se trastoca en todos los sentidos. El mayordomo sede el espacio de su casa durante un a?o al Ni?opan, generalmente la sala y el comedor que adornan con flores y velas; en su defecto le ofrecen una recamara.      Los gastos que hace el mayordomo son incalculables pues varia de la generosidad del mismo.      Sin embargo, se cree que no es menos de 60 mil pesos anuales divididos en flores, telas, ropa, fiestas, volantes, etc. El mayordomo durante su gestin suspende sus labores econmicas normales, pues se dedica a venerar la imagen. El mayordomo cambia de ropa diariamente a la imagen y lo acompa?a a las visitas que haga a casas, hospitales u otras parroquias.      El interesado en tenerlo un da de 7 a 19:30 hrs. debe rendirle homenaje con una misa parroquial, cuetes, msica, comida e invitados, as como obsequiarle un vestido nuevo y llevarle en procesin hasta su casa o residencia del mayordomo.      A veces hay que esperar hasta 3 o 4 meses que el Ni?opan vaya a donde se le requiere.      Para las fiestas decembrinas los preparativos comienzan desde 5 a?os antes. El mayordomo escoge sus nueve posadas a donde llevar la imagen del 16 al 24 de diciembre. Desde entonces el mayordomo y los posaderos planean la manera de celebrar as como la comida y los obsequios que ofrecern. Las posadas representan simblicamente la bsqueda de Mara para conseguir alojamiento y dar a luz. La posada comienza a las siete de la ma?ana y termina en la madrugada del otro da. Durante la jornada la gente va a saludar al Ni?opan y el posadero ofrece comida (desayuno, comida y cena, adems de colaciones, cacahuates, bebida, baile entre otros, de manera gratuita a todo el que asista, ya que nadie menosprecia al Ni?opa. Se calcula que cada posadero gasta alrededor de 20 mil peso en su celebracin, cosa que para ellos es un honor.

Please go back to either or both and get some professional help. You already paid for it!     Listening to advice from strangers who know nothing, have no particular information about what or why you're taking anything, and may be providing bad advice isn't very wise. DO NOT listen to those folks who tell you to insert them rectally 10 times a day.

If you are quite confused about when you are suppose to start taking it and how long you are suppose to be taking it...you need to speak to your gyno. asap.      Dosage (how many times a day) is usually on your prescription bottle.  I took it for infertility reasons.  It was used to increase the size of the follicles on the ovary.  I went in on a scheduled appointment where I had an ultrasound done to ascertain the size that they had or had not become.  I did receive an increase in dosage.  Now.  I had been seeing a group practice where I had more than one doctor see me throughout my infertility treatment.  I had one doctor express concern over the dosage I was increased to.    Also, my daughter, who I conceived through the use of Clomid, has the condition of hydrocephalus.  Later, I bumped into another woman who had used Clomid for infertility treatment, as well.  Her daughter had a heart condition.  Now, this is just a theory...epilepsy (which is tied to hydrocephalus) is a genetic condition in my family.  My theory is that the heart condition that the other little girl had was also a genetic condition and I think that the Clomid had the potential to enhance or bring out a genetic condition more.  Again, it is just a theory...and a theory of mine.  It is not a studied theory.      Talk to your doctor.|`|41eb1c7cd656169b509f23467450eb53aa	Clomid is a powerful prescription drug, you should not be confused as to the dosage of the length of therapy.

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Oh, I could write a thesis on this great question (I actually chose to become a math teacher, but only stuck out a year in the junior high before I decided elementary better suited me.)   I will try to control myself...    First, we've had great controversy in the past years over whether to ability group children or not.  You had "experts" coming in insisting it would damage self esteem...while now we are realizing ability grouping is essential.  So some schools may still not even be on board with the reading groups, much less the math groups.    Second, the curriculum is set up in a way that makes ability grouping in math very difficult.  In cases where the math curriculum does spiraling (basically touching briefly on a concept, moving on, only to come back to that concept more indepth at a later time,) you can see how this is not conducive to dividing children up.  Many places have also become unreasonable in age/grade related goals...for example, you have abstract concepts being an "appropriate" education goal in 2nd grade.  Hello...that age is incapable of thinking abstractly.  So in these instances, we are finding the majority of students are "behind" in math concepts...no need to even attempt ability grouping in this type of setting.    All that being said, if you have a GOOD teacher, they WILL recognize that children are on different levels in EVERY subject and will plan accordingly.  It may not be apparent that the educator is ability grouping (as in reading...it is very easy to tell that the "blue group" is reading at a higher level than the others.)  What you will see is a teacher that sets up centers and has students visiting those centers in groups on basically the same level.  This provides the teacher the opportunity to focus on specifics.  I might be able to hover over the group of students struggling with geometric shapes to provide more...while I could give the group that excels at that concept an additional activity for their table (G&T in disguise.)    Mini novel, better stop.  The point was, no, officially most schools have difficulty arranging ability based math groups (although SOME schools do.)  However, most competent teachers will take it upon themselves to make sure half the class isn't frustrated beyond belief from feeling left behind while the other half is bored to tears from already knowing the material.  (Hope I didn't bore you to tears...lol!)|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My oldest sons class does not have different math groups like they do reading.  It is frustrating to me, because my son, although he makes excellent grades, is the type of student who must be kept busy, or boredom sets in and he gets himself into trouble.  During the math lesson, whomever is finished first is supposed to sit there quietly and read a book or draw and wait for the others to finish.  My son is usually done fairly quickly according to his teacher, and with a somewhat hyper child such as him, drawing can only work for so long...    But, my step daughters class does have a seperate group for both math and reading.  They took some tests and the teacher assessed whether they were "in need of practice", "on target", or "mastered the skill" and put them into groups accordingly.    Personally, I think all schools should have their entire school system set up this way.  I think that every student should take some standardized test that will help determine how well they are understanding the material.  Then, children in the same percentile should be put in classes together.  That way, kids that need more practice can get it, and be with peers that also need practice....this will help avoid kids feeling bad about asking questions.  We all know that if a child feels like he is the only one asking, he might be embarassed and stop asking all together.  Also, the kids who don't need extra practice could start working on the material coming up, and don't feel like they are stuck waiting all the time.|`|j2mRop0laa	Yes, in a way. The teacher has told us on occasion, at conferences, that the children will not all have the same math and reading homework. Both of my girls have tested very high on reading and math (even though my oldest detests math). My oldest daughters teacher does have reading groups by level but nothing in place for math. My youngest daughters teacher has her hands full this year. The students are all over the place with academics and they are equally split in math. While some kids are still working on *timed addition and subtraction* others are moving on to word problems and carrying/ borrowing. So obviously they all don't get the same homework, but during *class* she tries to keep the lessons steady, while giving the children that finish quickly or early, additional problems to solve.|`|AkFag8tNaa	No and I have no idea why. Reading is obviously crucial for every single subject one will take but math is universal and such a crux in so many students' school career. Now, there is college track math for the middle schoolers and high schoolers but not at elementary level when the foundation is being set.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	My son's school doesn't have "math groups" per se', but it does have special classes for students who have tested below the level they are expected to be at.  It is called Individual Education Plan (IEP) and the children who need a little more help in any subject are given smaller classrooms with a more self paced learning style.    My own son has this for reading and math and I  believe it is also available for other subjects as well.  In my opinion, math groups would be an awesome idea.  Math is a subject that is so vary "precept upon precept', when a child falls behind, it's almost impossible to catch back up without some individualized teaching.    EDIT*******I really think you need to get that second career thing going...............|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	this is a sore subject w/me.  its heterogeneous and homogeneous grouping.  the schools where i am stopped doing that completely a few years ago.  i don't agree with the change at all.  in fact it makes me pretty mad.    here everyone is randomly selected to be in which class.  no rhyme nor reason.  random.  that is useless in my opinion.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	Nope...all one group.  I don't know if I think the same system would work for math actually, but it's an interesting thought.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Our school doesn't have different groups for math. However, in my sons class 3 of the kids do go to the 5th grade room for their math lesson. I think the main reason many schools don't have different math groups is because of the amount of time needed for actual instruction versus independent study. If you need 35 mins of instruction during a 50 min class it would be impossible to have different instruction for 2 or more groups.
EtCRnDJMaa	I really do think a 10 year old child could do something like this.  My mom just called me right when I pulled this up to read about it.  She has a co-worker who has a boy who has a lot of problems and she said he tried to hang himself at school yesterday.  This boy just turned 9 yesterday.  He writes down names of classmates who he wants to kill.  He brought a butcher knife to school.  He brought the rope to school.  They do have many counselors for him and are "watching" him.  The parents have a guard dog by their 2 yr old daughters room so he wont kill her.  This has been going on for as long as they can remember.  When this boy was 2 years old he beat up his day care teacher with a stick.  They can't put him in a home until he's a certain age.  There is clearly something going on in his brain that he cannot control.  He says the voices tell him to do these things.      So it possible for a 10 year old to do this.  Being that this happened in Chicago I would also wonder if another student did this to the boy.  Maybe they aren't saying so they can find out more.      Sometimes we don't want to think our children could do this, because then it would mean that we have failed as parents.  I wouldn't take that for an answer and would look further into it than what they gave me.|`|j2mRop0laa	I have never seen a depressed 10 year old, but I guess that doesn't mean they aren't out there.   I'm just thinking of my daughters classmates (10 through 11 year olds) and although I think some don't have the best home life, I don't think it's so terrible they could ever hang themselves.   I was very suspicious of this story from the get go.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I wanted to kill myself when I was 10 I think that it's definitely possible that he could have been even more depressed than I was and could hang himself. It's not that difficult to hang oneself.|`|TQW5E6olaa	That's a fishy situation, I would fight for answers, I wouldn't be quick to accept it as suicide    Poor family, what a tragedy.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I haven't read the article yet but I did read a headline about it.     I honestly don't know ... anymore the pressures, burdens and influences on even very young children might introduce these ideas into their heads much sooner than they should or than we think. But usually kids either don't have that concept of death and dying, or don't want to die. I think it would depend on my child and his situation - if I knew he was unhappy, *maybe,* and that's a stretch. But I would definitely want answers, since it happened on school property. Didn't this happen once before at a school not that long ago? They were trying to determine if it was suicide but I think they ended up ruling that out. *shudder*    I also know that even very young kids can be cruel - you never know if there might have been some foul play involved. I remember when that 4 year old in England was lured by two older boys about 10 or 12 and they killed him. It was probably one of the saddest, most disturbing and disgusting things I've read in a long time.     I better go back and read the article. : /|`|nBMVi9t8aa	im 10 years old idk i will ask my momma|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	YES. I'm not saying that's what definitely happened in this case. And you would think that somebody would have seen some kind of warning bell that would be mentioned after the fact. But children can have serious mental health problems just like adults can. Kids can and do commit suicide, although we don't hear of it very often. Often they are ignored or they can't get help because of the ridiculous shortage of child psychologists/psychiatrists. I know a fourteen year old who hung himself. He was a friend of the family. It wasn't the parents' fault. They also have other children who are fine.    Kids can have major depression, manic depressive disorder, severe OCD, Asberger's, schizophrenia, brain tumors, you name it.     I am very very sorry for this little boy.|`|DHzwr1braa	Was this is chicago. I don't believe a ten year old would hang hisself. This is truly sad.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	down here in georgia we had a 7 year old hang himself with a belt from his top bunk and yeah i can believe that a 10 year old killed himself|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I would want proof that it wasn't an accident or foul play. As a mother it would be terribly hard to grasp why a child would want to kill himself. The self questioning and self doubt alone would drive me insane.     That said it is entirely possible the medical examiner is right and it was a suicide. We simply don't know enough information to be able to state the ME is wrong.|`|wCDAYGd0aa	he is just a baby really and shouldnt even be thinking about that so i say it was setup|`|ULgGWDnWaa	A child of any age can be depressed, children as young as 2 have been known to purposely self harm! and yes it is possible that this is what happened the child! do you not think that the coroner would of looked into every avenue in this case! who wants to believe a 10 year old can do this! no one! but it can happen! if a 10yr old can kill someone else why not them selves! i know it can be hard to believe that children this age can think this way, but they can, my brother had suspected depression last year at 5, he was asking why he was alive, why can't I be dead, it was heart breaking!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	That is so sad.But I have the feeling it was no accident.There must of been signs if he was feeling like that.There usually is.|`|AA12151072	I think its very possible but on this particular story i really doubt it, the boy would have some sort of behavior problems or at least some sign that something was wrong, he went to school happy, i think a child put him up there as a joke and got scared and left after seeing he couldnt get him off|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I read that story this morning and the whole time I thinking, there has to be something more here.     If I was told my child committed suicide I would want 100% proof. Suicide has such a bad stigma. I think society faults the parents when they here this.     What a terrible story.|`|aBzRV8EXaa	somebody kill him or he been bully|`|AA10730513	I think it is possible. But not very likely that the boy really committed suicide. I am leaning toward the theory that he just got bored or curious and was goofing off and something went wrong. ... Perhaps he read something about people being hanged and wondered what it felt like. He may have thought he could just do it for a few seconds then pull himself to safety before he died. Or he could have seen someone picked up by their head and wondered what that felt like. (like a circus performer or a classmate) Maybe he was just trying to pick himself up and the thing holding him slipped back to his neck.     There are so many possibilities that could be based on a 10 year old's curiosity and lack of good judgment. ... I hope that nobody did this to him. That it was all an accident and will not happen again.     I hope nothing like this ever happens to my child or any other child I have grown fond of. But if it did - I would demand a thorough investigation. If they found that it was suicide, I would think hard about her recent behavior and decide if I think she could have really been depressed, or if it was just a lapse in judgment of her own physical abilities.     My heart and prayers go out for this family and all families in similar situations. It's really sad and hard to believe.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I can not comment about this situation but yes a child that age can kill themselves. I agree with Nanook of the North-Canadian Gal answer. I am from canada's north too and  have personally known kids to commit suicide.  The youngest was 11,  and he killed himself because he found the body of his 13 year old brother who killed himself.    I agree with you tho.....it should always be investigated to rule out foul play.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Any thing is possible these days.  Its sad, but completely possible.  I did also hear a story about kids who were playing some stupid game where they strangle themselves just long enough to pass out, supposedly it gives them some sort of high.  There was a little boy who was like 11, who hanged himself with his karate belt.  Come to find out it wasn't a suicide at all.  He had been playing that stupid game, and was alone, and accidentally fell with the belt around his neck and killed himself.  This world is just a sad, sad place.

I moved cross country.  From Philly to Cali, San Diego.  BUT i didnt have my son then so it's alot different.      only advice i can offer up is that it will be the hardest thing you ever did.  once the excitement of moving goes away all your left with is this strange city.      it's also one of the most rewarding feelings once you become comfortable and a little more familarized with the area.    one thing my ex said to me when i moved out with him (thats who i went with, my ex husband was in the miltary so i finished school then moved) he said, it's one thing to "think" your an independant person when your at home but you have know idea what or how independance feels like til your in a strange place.  it's the truth man.. i'm from a very close neighborhod where i know EVERYONE.. you take for granted the "perks" you have in your home town... i walk around like i own this city.. hahaha... out there i was no one... well eventually i was someone once i coped.  it's one of my favorite times in my life and i'd do it again in a hear beat...    another piece of info though.  i knew i wasnt out there forever... so that helped when the lonliness kicked in.  what else is cool is that no one knows you.. you get to build brand new relationships with new people who dont know your whole life story and can judge.. it can be a good or bad thing..   another good thing that you'll have is your child.. she'll keep you busy. i was alone and my ex was always out to Sea.      oh, i also wished i had the money or the closiness to come home when i wanted.. it was too far for me to do that..     good luck in whatever you decide|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I'm not in your situation, but i just wanted to tell you that it gets H-O-T HOT! in Arizona which would not be good for Bella's asthma either.

The reason I say this is because it may take a few months for you to conceive. It really depends on your body and cycle, I mean hey, you may just get pregnant on the first try, but for most women, it takes a few tries. So I would still plan on trying in March and getting your body ready ( taking prenatal vitamins, eating right etc...).

It is also possible that in all the Christmas rush, they birthday may not be treated as well as if it were around another time.  However, we all have to be born at some point, Christmas periods included, and what better present could you ask for?  My second child was born on New Years Eve. For him, he will have a fantastic pasrty every year (and hopefully a public holiday the following day). I do admit though that with all the busy periods, I did not organise his 1st birthday as well as I should have, but I will just ahve to be more aware and make sure I do better next year.  Good luck!|`|DZCFD0p2aa	The biggest pro is that you can give one gift and say it's both the birthday and christmas gift....saves money.    To Happy...yes, you can conceive in 1 month.

I'm not a fan of Christmastime for a new baby. Holidays are stressful as it is, and you would be tossing more upon the heap. And you have to be very diligent to keep birthday and Christmas celebrations separate.    Riaz: Yes, I know it is possible, but it is statistically unlikely. It takes 6 months of half of TTC couples to get pregnant, and 12 months for 95% of them to get pregnant. Even if your timing is right, you still only have about a 20% chance of success on any given month.    Soxy: Yes, we are/were all hopeful!

Good luck x|`|Ndw34J0daa	I was diagnosed with PCOS (gained weight on birth control, normal hormone levels, no cysts). I dieted (still very hard to lose the weight), took Metformin for five months, and started having regular periods after 4 weeks.

I spotted one month and thought I'd messed everything up but got pregnant the next month (fifth month). I never took anything in addition. And prior to being on Depo Provera for a year, my periods were regular. Before trying the Metformin, we had been trying for over a year and a half.

0xiHNsmVaa	I know what you mean. Some are trolls, but most are real. My question is why don't you ask it in the PREGNANCY section, wouldn't you get more information and help there? Most people here are teenagers.    And I have nothing against teen parents either, my grandma gave birth to my dad at 15.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	they probably have no one who will help them so they turn to strangers who want 2 points. i'm 15 too and am a virgin. my parents would KILL me if i got pregnant as a teen and i'm not ready to die yet.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i agree ,,,, they had no moral codes what so ever ,,, think it great ,,, but it the poor kids that don't have a life ,, they usually end up in the welfare system ,, that make me very angry about these girls   ,  they don't think or have not had a education in life, all they worry about in sex ,,,,|`|BeIX5pH1aa	I definatly agree, I'm fiftenn too, and im still a virgin  its kinda unbelievable how irresponsible some people are|`|cCsN3tcZaa	that's because they think they can even though they knoe they couldn't.. but  thats them|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Because this is the adolescent section. They come here for help.    All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:    EDIT:    I was 14 when I lost my virginity. If I just told you that part of the story you would immediately judge me. Lets hear to rest, see how your opinion changes... I was with him 2 years before. He had already lost his virginity, he waited for me. 7 years later we are marrying on 25/06/09. Changes doesn't it? Teens CAN be in love.    xx|`|44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	I dont think that's related to having morals or not, at least not in my perspective. It's not immoral to have sex.     I think it's a personal choice and a matter of being responsible and knowing the consequences of your actions, in fact, life is all about that, you cannot go through life doing things and expecting that those wont have outcomes.     And yes, 15 is a very early age in MY opinion, and so is 16, but, again, what is the "good" age, who decides that???     Everyone's different, people decide when to do it and they do it, period, you cant expect everyone to see life as you do, so dont judge them.     They decided something, they did it, and it brought their good or bad consequences.|`|NAvaa1Araa	Uh cause they're not careful, and rush into things, doing it when they're not ready. I completely agree! I too have morals and frankly don't make any sense of it either, but I don't think we ever will. I know part of it is our society, peer pressure, T.V., and all that happy crap. I suggest you just focus on yourself and don't let it bother you. That's what I do and it helps!|`|fzZudEBqaa	dont know ask them|`|kri8u2bPaa	actually im 15 && i am pregnant the reason maybe for us talking bout it so much is because this is the ******* pregnancy section duhhhh:)|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Most are trolling. They like the attention. Real pregnant teens would be grounded, or out looking for jobs to support their child. ??|`|r39EDGhPaa	Well, you're under the pregnancy&parenting forum.  What do you expect?    Just because they are pregnant doesn't mean they have no morals.  You could have sex one time, completely protected, and get pregnant.  I've had sex before.. does that mean I'm lacking morals?  No, it just means my morals are different than yours.  And who says everyone is going to get married? I've never wanted to get married, and I never will.  Who says everyone will go to college?|`|2QvIM81Haa	Just a coincidence that they happen to be on here.
94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	It's more likely to be told it's a boy and actually have a girl - the umbilical cord can look AWFULLY similar to little boy parts!    This happened to my roommate - her mom was told she was going to be a boy and didn't find out differently until my friend was born!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	The tech told me at 19weeks we were having a boy(which we thought it was anyway)......i had to have an ultrasound at 22weeks and the tech said a girl - i was shocked and made her triple check, and sure enough she still said girl. I didn't believe it still, so when i had my 27week ultrasound (ive had alot of problems so alot of ultrasounds) they once again said girl, and showed me - yep its a girl. Biggest shock i have ever had!!|`|VUss5AfAaa	no, i found out when i was 20 weeks pregnant.  and as soon as i saw that lil penis i was sure it was a boy!    then again i had a nother ultrasound and it was a boy again.  so no i never question the tech.    but from what iv herd sometimes they could be wrong.  make sure you ask again when you get another ultrasound!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey   not me. I was more than certain Than they were its a boy, the parts were very clear. And different to girls parts.    god bless x
veO1RXrCaa	Yup I would put bumpers on the crib.  I took them off Alexanders when he got a blanket stuck between them and his face.  Thank god I had the angel care monitor or he may have smothered.  But I put them back on when he was older and got his foot or arm ( I can't remember which) stuck in the bars.  Of course the little bugger learned to climb out his crib when he was 16 or 17 months old.  :)  The bumper gave him grip for his feet.|`|q4ppgGe1aa	Do you already have crib bumpers? If not then try those. :)    My daughter was doing this even with bumpers, so I gave in and bought a Pack n' Play instead. It has mesh sides instead of bars so she won't hurt herself.     Hope that helps! :)|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i got a mesh like  bumpers which goes around the crib/cot, it is designed for this thing not to happen and as they get bigger and start to stand, it just pushes down. i got it in big W (australia)
85V6cHe4aa	Yes my husband had that from a very young age too,he had the sperm analysis which came back on the lower end of average but i am pleased to tell you that we went on to have 6 lovely healthy children with no problems concieving at all.    Best of luck to you xx
84b26tbzaa	WOW! sounds like a relationship like mine. maybe he is just having fun but you should talk to him and tell how you feel or he may never stop. If you know that hes a playful person explain to him that there is a time and a place for every thing. If you love him give him the benifit of the doubt but dont wait too long before you know it 7 years will be gone pass and you  two will still be in the same situation. i wish you the best sweetie because i understand that relationships are not perfect but us women need to get some backbone especially me.|`|d0sztRa9aa	Stop enabling him. If he always has to depend on you and money, and if he can't get his financial situation in better shape then he's not going to learn unless you cut him off at some point. He needs to understand everything he has and is able to do in his life is a luxury, and he shouldn't take you for granted. He needs some tough love, or he'll never grow out of it.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	This is hard to say. Some man still have a chance and other well others not. Some man grow up when their first child is born and others just run. About the money thing why don't you see if he will let you take care of his money and have you give him a set amount each week. If that goes will than I would say there is still hope.|`|WbJPQM1naa	Well easy does it!  Don't rush stuff.  If you really love him and he loves you, carefully wait until you are both ready to be married and further WAIT until you are BOTH ready to have a child.  Children will only bring a LOT of challenges to you both and you need to be prepared for that.    I would talk with him now about your goals and see if he has the same goals regarding marriage and children.  If he doesn't want to have the same future with you, I would make the decision to move on.  You are young and I believe that there is a "right" someone for everyone that wants one.  I have made some very faulty choices when it comes to relationships and reaped harsh consequences from those choices.  Like being left to raise my children on my own.  I accept that I decided to ignore some serious signs that these relationships were not going to work out.    Many women tend to get caught up in their ideals and dreams and lose sight of the realities they see in their partners.  Or we like to be optimistic, to a fault, always believing the best about them or that, given enough time or enough of our love, they will somehow change.  Sometime, this happens,  but more often, it doesn't and you find yourself really stuck in a loveless and unhappy marriage with kids after years of your devotion to your partner.      There are some deeper signs in your "funny" story about walking the dog.  His behavior, in addition to being very juvenile, was rather disrespectful of you and what you specifically requested of him.  This behavior, while quickly excused and apologized for, can become a dangerous habit.  I once asked a marriage counselor what one issue he thought was the cause of marriage breakups.  I expected him to answer, "money problems" or something like that.  But, instead he surprised me by simply stating, "Lack of respect for one another".  I realized later that he was totally right!  If you don't have concern and respect for one another, you really cannot build intimacy in a healthy way.    As it is right now, you are seeing some serious behaviors.  If he's using drugs, that is a definate "RED flag" to consider.  If he is not handling his finances in a healthy way, even for himself, this is a "RED flag" for you both.  If he treats you with disrespect, or puts you down in front of others, even if he acts like it's only a joke, he is being abusive and ANY abuse: physical, emotional, verbal or financial is a definate "RED flag", and through my experience of being in an abusive relationship, I would say a definate DEAL BREAKER!      I would open lines of communication with him and talk to him seriously about your concerns in everything.  Especially with regard to his handling of his money.  Some people are simply not taught healthy ways of taking care of their finances.  So, finding a class about financial matters and budgeting might be helpful for you both.  One good rule, which I regret not learning as a young person, is never live beyond your means.  Always take your take home pay, give away the first 10%, SAVE the next 10% and learn to live on the 80% you have left.  You will ALWAYS be blessed because of your giving and you will ALWAYS have something saved for emergencies when you need it.      Think, write, talk and pray about your future with this man.  And above all ... please use protection now and DON'T have a child with him until you are both settled down and ready to be parents!     Many Blessings to you both and much love,  R|`|SToOdHj1aa	Are you sure that is what you want?  You are at that age where you may think that marriage is the next step, or maybe you think that you might as well marry him since you invested so much time with him.  But, you have to be sure that it is what you want.  You can't marry someone hoping that they will change.  Some guys never grow up.  There is no reason to rush these things.  If he is worth it, then wait it out and see.  If you decide that he isn't then move on.  But remember, you'll waste more of your life marrying the wrong person and having to start over later, than you would starting over now.
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	the blond that i married gives off more headaches that the medicine that i have to take that has side effects of severe migraine headaches.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Oh come now..... one vs 4....easy call - the KIDS for sure!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Neither, really.  But, the kids certainly give me challenges & things to worry about.    I can't imagine sharing my life with an adult who I had no respect for, who I thought behaved like a child.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	my kids... my husband is amazing and is my partner.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	The hubby, hands down.  Not only do I have to pick up after him more than I pick up after the kids, but I have to balance his checkbook, remind him when bills are due, and be his friend as well as his wife....he wears me out!  But, I love him, so I guess that's why I do it.  ;-)|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Without a doubt my husband.  When people ask how many kids I have I always say "Including my hubby?"  Dont get me started on how he acts when he is sick or has a slight injury :)|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Hubby.   I expect these things from the kids, not a grown man.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Hubby. Seriously its like I have 2 babys sometimes.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Hubby. He is the baby, not my 4 month old!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	husband. i can expect tantrums, drama, and cleaning up after and taking care of every need that a child has... that's why children depend on their parents. HOWEVER my husband is SUPPOSED to be a grown man and acts just like (if not worse) then the kids. oh and he complains more|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Hubby definitely. It feels like I have 2 babies to take care of instead of one.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I'm a stay at home mom and still my husband who works 12 hour days 5 days a week manages to make a bigger mess than my 1,3 and 5 year olds... I actually assigned him a corner in our room where he can go and dump his stuff so at least it wont be all over the house anymore :)    And yes, oh lord if he happens to be sick... it really is worse taking care of him than my 3 year old those days.. And when I'm sick he'll tell me to go to sleep , he'll watch the kids and every single time he has just fallen asleep on the couch an hour later.. so now we are both sleeping while the kids are emptying the fridge on the floor and playing in the toilet....   But I still rather live with him than be single... I guess I do love him...|`|JnLoHaoAaa	It's always one of the two|`|ewQDWKp0aa	I would say BOTH|`|BRBPDBvIaa	My husband is the same way and I hate it. He always leaves his clothes in the living room and I keep telling him over and over to pick them up and he'll say ok, but he wont for days.  However, as far as the headaches go, I'd say my kids give me the headaches.  I have a 5 and 2 year old.|`|qv2CtINuaa	Hubby. Kids put their clothes away & keep things off of the floor, he doesn't.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I'd have to say neither. I long ago cultivated the ability to block them all out. Want to know how?    Anytime one of them starts to get loud or annoying, I nod and go about my business all the time imagining the hot UPS guy that just dropped off whatever it was I randomly ordered so that I had something to fantasize about while my family was going crazy.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Haha Hubby. I expect my child to behave immature!|`|AA11851101	Both in different ways
Ybo6HS8Caa	LOL that is cute.  My kids like Mythbusters, How It's Made, and my oldest who is 8 sometimes likes to watch surgery shows with me.  My little one, who is also 5, is so funny, because he can tell you all about the election, as well as many other news stories, and if he hears a grown up talking about a news story he will say "oh, yeah. i heard that too.  Matt Lauer told me all about it."  LMAO    Edit - Brewer...that is sooo cute!  Those progressive commercials are pretty funny.  Flo is a nut!    Edit - Oh yeah, I forgot about Dirty Jobs!  That is one that we actually like to watch as a family.    Edit - Sadie, that's so true!  My youngest does that with fast food restaurants too.  His favorite is "Spangles, it just tastes better!"|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	My 5-year-old son likes Paula Deen. LOL I always say how she looks like such a grandma and somehow I think that appeals to him. Although the other day, she had on another very SOuthern speaking woman and they were cooking together, and my son asked, "Are they arguing?" LOL I said, "No honey, that's just how they talk!" LMAO    We also like to watch Lawrence Welk occasionally. On Sundays there are usually no cartoons on, so if the TV is on and we're flipping through we'll watch sometimes. We like to take bets on what color suits they'll have on LOL. One time they had people dressed in 18th century garb while singing, and he said, "Mom, those people look *ridiculous!*" My husband and I just busted up laughing.    ETA: Oh yes, I forgot "How It's Made." My son particularly enjoyed how they made marbles and LP records. LOL And how they made cheese on Dirty Jobs with Steve Rowe. LOL|`|q0JTN9QAaa	My two year old loves the progressive comercials with FLO on them.  He either loves her voice or thinks she is very pretty because he will drop what he is doing to watch her and his face lights up.  We DVR then incase he is sick or sad or something.    He also loves music videos.|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	when i was little my fave shows were always not kid shows  like game shows i loved who wants to be a millionaire and will of fortune and shows like that  i also used to like friends and everybody loves raymond    edit - i use to like those house buying shows too and home decorating and 20/20 lol|`|oP504BtFaa	My daughters are 13, and although I allow them to watch shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost and Grey's Anatomy, there are definitely pieces of the shows that I cringe at and think to myself "Should they be watching these?"    One of my daughters likes the history channel, someone else mentioned that. Gah! I'd be bored to tears. They also like TLC shows about parenting and stuff - that's a little precocious if you ask me!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I'm obsessed with watching the re-runs of the original 90210 on sat. mornings. ( I grew up watching the show) My 18 mos old daughter loves the theme song and comes running when it comes on. She doesnt care for the show though.  My son used to love wheel of fortune at around 3 when he was learning his alphabet and also deal or no deal and millionare- show. He likes the gameshows in general and absolutely loves wipe out. ( hes almost 6)|`|a6beQD7Qaa	Cute! Looks like you might have a little chef on your hands :) My 4 year old likes to watch the Military history channel (boring I know!) but I think it's only because his daddy watches it & he idolizes his father. Kids aye?|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Once my son screamed that he wanted to watch the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, he was 3. It was a passing thing.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	My daughter loves anything on the Discovery Channel. She was really into that Meer cat Manor show for the longest time. My son loves all kinds of shows that are not for kids. He also has favorite commercials. For the longest time all he wanted to watch was the Chips Ahoy! commercial where they are driving in the car and singing "Don't you want me baby"  He also associates businesses with their slogans. Subway is not Subway. He points and says he wants to Eat Fresh. And McDonald's was forever "Ba, Ba, Ba-ba-ba..I'm lovin' it" It's amazing how easily these things can grab a little one's attention.|`|K24QQ2mlaa	for some reasons, my 17 months old daughter like to watch commercials about career colleges and attorneys/lawyers commercial. she'll stop what she's doing or if she hear it from a distance then she'll come running to the TV and just watch it.|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Discovery Channel and TLC shows like "What Not to Wear", "Baby Story" or any medical special on either channel.    And here is the weirdest my kids (and hubby he is who got them hooked) absolutely LOVE Monty Pythons Flying Circus, of course at times we have to flip it but 95% of the time it is fine, and they laugh hysterically especially my oldest. They are 8 and 10, both girls.|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	My 8 yr old will watch desperate housewives because one of the little girls on the show was in her gymnastics class 2 yrs ago. My 3 yr old loves to watch "hells Kitchen"
bZWbwyn4aa	Wow, my hubby and I discussed this after Christmas.  We have 3 children who are the result of split relationships (my son and his daughter and son) but we also have one of our own.  And this Christmas just gone we realised that our daughter is actually the one who gets less because she only has one Christmas, as opposed to the other kids getting 2 or 3 Christmases!!    These kids are 16, 11,9 and 4 (the 4 year old is the one who is confused about why she only gets one "Christmas").    We are still trying to resolve this, but we do recognise we can't control what happens with the kids' other parents, so we need to deal with it in some way on our end.  However, the older 2 understand the Santa deal these days, so that does make it easier to explain if we decide to cut back on theirs or buy her extra.    However, I do understand, there can be an imbalance and it is difficult to decide how to handle it - we are in the same place.|`|AA12322129	I am in this particular situation.  I have found that it does not hurt them.  Ex spouses can not always stand each other nor even the stepparents.  Which is better, having the birthday or holiday with quibbling parents and stepparents or have two seperate things?  They get the benefit of having time with both parents and sides of family while getting gifts....as long as it is not making them unhappy why not do it?|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	My kids get 2 of everything, and sometimes 3 since my ex's parents live 3 hours away from us.  The only downfall I see is that I feel my kids are very spoiled.  I honestly don't even think that my kids think about it.  It's just life as they know it.  I don't think it hurts them, becuase I make a point to be sure that they leave anything they got at their dads house with him.  He is not good about making sure they have their own things there, so I leave as much there as I can so they can at least have a few of their own things while they are visiting him on the weekends.
IFDfpbFJaa	It doesn't bother me when teens answer in here. It annoys me more that there is the adolecent section in this main section so when I'm here asking or giving advice about being pregnant I have to read "omg, I'm pregnant by one of the johna brothers *tee hee*" or "my mom took my cell phone away because I'm failing 3 classes....can you  believe it !?"   That's more annoying to me than teens answering.|`|jdRKZe18aa	No I think we might learn something from kids of any age as well as experienced adults or parents.... I look for someone with some sense, logic and genuine WISDOM in their answers & thoughts regardless of their age.|`|BJERgbM5aa	A person's age doesn't annoy me.  If their advise is constructive and helpful, what's the difference about the age?  Only thing about the age question is when a teen asks for 'help' with their homework.  the word 'help' is the key operational word.  they don't mean help.  They want someone to actually do the homework or the research or whatever.  They're just too lazy to even use their own computer, and time, to use the internet!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It does kind of annoy me when teens answer, mostly when a teen answers with an offensive answer or a put down, that is just uncalled for.  If it's a helpful answer it doesn't matter, sometimes someone elses viewpoint is all that is needed.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Not at all,actually its great to see answers from teens because im a mum to 6 children and one is a teen and my twins are almost teens so i like to see opinions from young people who have an idea where my kids are coming from!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I believe in freedom of speech and non dictatorship.  This is a public forum.  i have a brain.  I use it.  It matters not to me whether someone is providing an opinion to one of my questions whether they have no kids or 20.  Its still an opinion no matter what their child situation is.  I would prefer all people to be kind and courteous however, once again, this is a public forum with free speech.|`|cCsN3tcZaa	NO!!!! because it your personaly opinion!!!! and at least your mature to answer them so chill|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If  you can help I don't care how old you are. I think having a different perspective can help sometimes also. I have never asked questions in this section.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	No, I want to hear from all age groups when I ask questions - hearing from a teen actually gives me more insight to how my kids are thinking.
GK00Rz5caa	Parents don't think things through.  If you don't clean your room, you have to deal with a dirty room anyway, so what does it matter?|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Then deal with it but if you can't find something or if your clothing begins to smell like mold from not getting washed it's on your head.|`|aiYPHUEWaa	'Cause parents feel like they have a responsibility to make the punishment so miserable you'll remember it FOREVER.  Then when you are thirty years old and wondering whether you should clean your house, you'll remember the punishment and GRATEFULLY clean the house.  I think it's a form of brain-washing...|`|xGRh8k2Baa	Basically they're just trying to teach you good habits by having a punishment to make you do something.  Cleaning a room sucks, we all know that, but when you're living on your own nobody will want to come over if your entire house is a mess.  If you got in the habit of living in a pigsty you'd never change it.  Basically they just want to teach you the "right" way, so if you ever slack a little later in life from super clean or whatever it's not as bad as a messy person slacking and living in a house that smells like feet and has jeans for a carpet.|`|1E7gqGBGaa	Uhh...A double standard would be them telling you not to smoke when they do. What you have is not a double standard unless your parents room is nasty. You should clean your room if for nothing else for health reasons....though most parents assign chores to teach their kids discipline which is about doing the things that have to be done...that's the best I can do for you.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Because, with any luck, long after the kids move out, our home will still be our home, and a room kept unkempt ends up in STANK and likely irreversible damage that the homeowners have to foot the bill for to correct.  Plus, it just makes sense to stay organized and clean. These habits come in handy later on.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Their house their rules. Not fair but such is life sorry.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would not call this a double standard. It is your moms responsibility to teach you how to take care of yourself. To respect your things and to take care of them. How to be organized and how to take care of your responsibilities. I make my children keep their rooms clean just like the rest of the house.|`|5CnFXw4Zaa	its the cycle of life.     it was either that or boarding school so be grateful|`|RSbn5STjaa	That's only a double standard if your mother keeps the rest of the house dirty.|`|AlEGoAMgaa	It's not that complicated. It's called "classical conditioning"... if you do or don't do something that your senior considers "bad", then you get punished. If you do or don't do something "good" then you get rewarded. Works the same with pets.|`|XI7JLX6gaa	their house their rules.|`|pLt3DzOgaa	haha they can go back on themselves sometimes, mmy parents used to tell me to tidy my room even though their room was worse.    I pointed this out once. got grounded for longer.|`|AIUZYCHyaa	I am not a parent but a student. I would think its like a punishment so that you learn your lesson. So you won't do it next time.|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	was the rest of the house a complete mess or was the rest of the house clean and your room was the mess.  I keep a clean house and my kids room is clean period. A lot of double standards is because we know, we have been there and want better for our kids.  (this doesnt exactly pertain to a clean room though)  but one day you will have to clean up after your child and i bet you will want your kid to clean up his/her own mess.  Its part of learning responsibilities.|`|yxgoG4wqaa	Because they want you to make the "right" choices when you become an adult.  Even though as an adult you do have the choice whether to clean your house or not, they want you to be the type of person that cleans it.  And they do that by trying to teach you "good" habits when they still can.|`|eyQBvbzraa	BEEN THERE DONE THAT THREE CHILDREN. OKAY, IF I ASK THE CHILDREN TO CLEAN THEIR ROOM AND THEY DO NOT...THAT IS DISOBEDIENCE.NOT ONLY THAT, BUT A PARENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SAY THINGS MORE THAN ONCE.THAT IS DISOBEDIENCE. WHICH YOU SHOULD GET PUNISHED FOR.ALL PARENTS USUALLY GOT PUNISHED FOR IT TOO. CLEANING YOUR ROOM TEACHES YOU THINGS WHICH YOU DO NOT REALIZE AS A CHILD. IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO DO THINGS YOU DO NOT NECESSARILY FEEL LIKE DOING. YOU WILL ENCOUNTER THIS IN ANY JOB YOU APPLY FOR LATER ON IN LIFE.AND TRUST ME YOUR BOSS WILL NOT JUST WAIT FOR YOU TO DO IT. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT. HE WILL FIRE YOU.WHICH WILL BE YOUR PUNISHMENT. IT ALSO HELPS FOSTER RESPONSIBILITYAND IF YOU SHIRK YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A KID IT WILL LEAD TO DOING THE SAME AS AN ADULT WHICH MAKES YOU A LESS DESIRABLE PERSON TO EMPLOY.IT ALSO LETS YOU LEARN HOW TO CLEAN SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE OLDER AND HAVE A PLACE OF YOUR OWN, YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO CLEAN AND WILL HAVE A MORE ORGANIZED LIFE WHICH DOES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, LEAD TO A HAPPIER LIFE. SORRY ABOUT THE CAPS,MY EYES HURT TODAY.SO, IN CLEANING YOUR ROOM WHEN YOU ARE TOLD OR ASKED TO DO SO, YOUR PARENTS ARE TEACHING YOU OBEDIENCE,SKILLS,HOW TO TAKE PRIDE IN WHAT YOU ARE BLESSED WITH AND HOW TO CARE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR BELONGINGS DOWN THE ROAD AS WELL AS HOW TO BE RESPONSIBLE AS WELL AS THERE WILL BE CONSEUENCES FOR THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IN YOUR LIFE. THOSE ARE LIFE LESSONS, NOT DOUBLE STANDARDS.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	there is always something else behind what i teach my kids. it might not be what they think it is (example, your clean bedroom)  i have my kids to clean their bedroom for the simple fact that it teaches them to be tidy, and how to organize. if i don't teach them, no one else will. you aren't born with the reasoning to clean . people are taught that. they are taught by how they grew up. if someone grew up amoung constant clutter and disorganization, then more than likely their house would be the same when they get older becuase they see it as being normal to them. its the same with taking your kids to church, making them go to school everyday, not letting them wear skimpy clothing, or cussing out your parents. its all to set a foundation later in life of how that particular parent would like to see their child living at 20-30 years old.  i do all these things becuase i  DON'T want to go to my kids house when they are 25 and see a dirty mess, or my grandkids cussing them out and talking nasty & smart alec, or missing school constantly becuase she was brought up to believe it wasn't important.    parents bring their kids up according to what they feel is important. those same kids can listen and grow off of that, and make more important choices with their own kids, or they can learn from the mistakes their parents made, and not do it to their own children. it is all for the sake of creation-|`|AFwMkAGlaa	If that's the worst thing you ever had to endure as a child,  consider yourself lucky.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Why should she have to deal with your dirty room?  WHen you get your own house, your "deal with it or clean it" theory is your decision.  In the meantime, your mum has a rule in her house, so she has a right to ask you to keep it clean.      And what do you mean by dirty?  For instance, my kids leave food wrappers, wet towels, dirty clothes, you name it.  That annoys the heck out of me because they attract bacteria, we end up with mouldy and ruined towels, ants, no clean clothes in their closets, you name it.  So I crack down on them like a ton of bricks on the tidiness of their rooms.  WHy should I do the washing when they feel like putting their clothes in the laundry because suddenly they realise they have no clean ones left?  I should be able to do the washing as I have the time to do it, not when they think it should be done.    There are a whole horde of reasons why your mother may have insisted on you keeping your room clean, but basically, it comes down to respecting property.  It is a lesson in life too - respecting the rules in the home, sets you up for respecting the rules outside the home as you get older.|`|RarSAK4Haa	your point is not a good point for your argument. its their house not yours if they want you to keep your room clean, so they don't have to see it, do it.|`|047IPSovaa	Because I said so.  End of lesson|`|T9vf2uU7aa	Because they're attempting to instill some good qualities (cleanliness, for example) in you at a young age.  No more reason than that.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	this is not double standard, it is home education.  Think this way, if your mother never show/tell you you need to clean your hands after you go to bathroom when you are a child, how will you get that idea?  Sure she can lets you figure out when you get older and care less whether you follow thru or not ... but we mothers never do that, because we love you and want you to do the right things from start.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Children aren't treated as equals because they aren't.  They don't go to work 40 hours a week, they aren't responsible for providing food, shelter, health care, education, discipline etc. etc.  They basically just hang around until they grow up.

Do you have friends who are going? Dance with them, you don't have to be good at it.

Just act calm and no one will notice. Have fun, good luck!|`|vja4ddNmaa	Tip  1: make sure that your head will not be under an axe because you lost a dance contest.    Tip  2: pretend that everything you hate about the world is under your feet and stomp the hell out of it.    Tip  3: do not take any notice of how you will be perceived while doing so, because it's not like your head is under an axe or something.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	just sway...thats what i do..|`|c4RT0sFOaa	feel the sound of the music.... :) don't stress about it or think too much ! have fun :)|`|UE3smuAJaa	im 13 also, there is grinding, i havent done it, but just be yourself, usually there are crowds, be in the middle, grinding is there. you do not have to do anything really in a grind if you are a girl. just dont stress over me...email me if u got any questions! ; )|`|zgDxpqRsaa	hey im 13 2 n dancing is my passion well try 2 make some moves of ur own or try watchin some vidoes n practice the steps or jus practice in front of ur mirror trust me u will improve|`|9JQiIQvfaa	welcome to my club|`|WwdR7PVdaa	Dont worry just move your hips to the music and watch how other people dance.

This is a big help, though:|`|RFK9sG6zaa	1st - you have to "feel" the music.  2nd - wait for a song that sounds so good it makes you just want to get up and move something (feet-arm's-head etc) to the beat.  3rd - don't give two hoot's how you 'think' you look to other people (if you took a survey most of them would say they were just looking in your direction to be looking)   They really did not see you at all.  4th - you came out to have a good time so go for it.  enjoy yourself !!!  5th - if you spot someone across the room you would like to dance with "get up", walk over ASK THEM TO DANCE.  You are not asking for a proposal of marriage.  You just want to share a moment in time with them.  (PLUS) if you don't make the move real quick somebody else might take your parking place.

Lillian Annabelle Brown ~ It's just got a cuteness about it. Plus, Lilly-Belle is a sweet nickname.    Lillian Alaina Brown ~ A close second. I like this one too. And, as you know, both names are on my list also.    Lillian Tatum Brown ~ I don't love it, but I have warmed up to Tatum a bit since I first heard it. I'd never heard it before you mentioned it. It flwos well and I think it'd be a nice compromise since your husband loves it.    Lillian Stevie Brown ~ The flow is ok. It doesn't sound bad. It's not my taste, but I love that it's a familt name.     Lillian Kate Brown ~ I'm not a big fan of Kate, but it's ok.    Lillian Chloe Brown ~ I don't really care for the flow on this one.    Lillian Taylor Brown ~ The flow isn't bad, but I don't like Taylor.    I'm glad you asked this question! I like seeing all of your middle name options for Lillian together.

rdGQMSyjaa	QUESTION : What do you think of my favorite names?     ANSWER : I'll rate them on a scale of 1-10 (1=hate,10=love) and comment....    Tristan Riley Brown ~ 9.5 (Very nice.)    Sebastian Jacob Brown ~ 2 (I don't like Sebastian at all. Jacob is ok.)    Austin Conley Brown ~ 7 (Conley has grown on me a lot lately.)    Lillian Alaina Brown ~ 9.5 (I love both names. Nice combo.)    Lillian Annabelle Brown ~ 9.5 (It's really sweet.)    Stevie Jean Brown ~ 4 (I'm not a fan of it, but love that it's a family name. I thought you were spelling Jean like "Jeanne"? I personally like the spelling Jean better, just wondering why you changed it.)    Stevie Alaina Brown ~ 6 (I think I like this better than Stevie Jean. It has a better flow and it's more feminine sounding.)    Lillian Stevie Brown ~ 4 (I don't care for it. Stevie just doesn't seem like it works too well as a middle name imo.)    Alaina Lillian Brown ~ 3 (While I love both names, the flow is way off for me. Lillian Alaina flows MUCH better.)    Alaina Taylor Brown ~ 5 (I don't care for Taylor, but it does flow ok.)    Alaina Tatum Brown ~ 7 (This has grown on me. I'm starting to like it.)    Bailey Alaina Brown ~ 3 (Ehh..I'm not big on Bailey. I don't really like the flow.)    Lillian Taylor Brown ~ 5 (I don't like Taylor very much.)    Alaina Bailey ~ 3 (I don't like Bailey, and the flow is off.)      QUESTION : Which boy and girl name is your favorite?    ANSWER : Tristan Riley & Lillian Alaina + Lillian Annabelle at a tie.    QUESTION : Are there any names that you would change, if so, how?     ANSWER: Hmm...this is a tough one.

I think they're interesting, I really appreciate how you're using family names, I think thats really great and will give your son/daughter a really great bond to his/her family.    2. My favorite boy's would be Sam Jacob. My favorite girl's is Lillian Annabelle.     3. I don't really understand how you got Sam as a nickname for Sebastian. It doesn't work. But Samuel Jacob Brown is a GREAT name. Also, I don't love Lilly with two ls, I like Lily much more. So my only change would be that I would spell "Lilly" "Lily" or "Lily-Belle"    4. Sam and Lily Belle (Sebastian Jacob and Lily Annabelle)    5. Stevie and Alaina    6. Trace and Sam|`|r782jijgaa	Boy-Love Tristan Riley and call him Trace.

Are there any names that you would change, if so, how?   I think I'd change the Jacob to Jakob, but that's just me.  The 'k' is more visually appealing to me.

Good luck!|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I was under the impression you couldn't take the act till you are a junior in high school.|`|d5K8wORqaa	i heard the test is soo easy compared to the SAT    the person who told me that is also a junior tho|`|jcVJM8FNaa	Hey, I'm 13 too and I took the ACT test last year in 7th grade for the Johns Hopkins University Talent Search, and I got accepted.    It's not about learning the material in preparation for the test. The administration does NOT, and i repeat, NOT care if you've learnt 12th grade math by now. They just want to see if you know anything BEYOND 7th grade, and that determines if you are eligible for the Talent Search. Remember, this test only helps others to see what NEW things you are capable of, NOT what things you already know.    I actually did well on this test, and I did not study because in fact, they do not expect us to study.

If you have to say it a second time you will have to say it a third and so on and pretty soon they will learn they can get away with it a few times before you punish them.    So if you only say it once then it happens again and you punish they will know that they can only do it once as oposed to multiple times and will think before they act because of that.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	No, that's half-azzed. They need to take responsibility for what they did. Raising kids isn't an experiment in making up clever sayings. They need guidance, they need absolute boundaries and of course, to be shown forgiveness. Children won't develop courage if they think they can get away with not being honest. And what if they didn't really do it? Then they think, rightly, that you're unfair. While your intentions might be good, you are showing your children that you are relenting in the pursuit of the truth, what does that tell them?|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Nope|`|xWqKKp0Naa	ha ha ,   that ,  and  do as i say , not as i did .

snDAuu27aa	This is Ryas schedule    Days with no school:  Gets up around 7:45, eats, sits in her bouncer while I get ready for the day, and then I get her dressed and ready for the day. By this time its about 9:00.  I play with her for a little bit (about 30 minutes) My mom takes her for about an hour to spend some time with her.  At about 10:30 she has a bottle and falls asleep.  I usually do homework while she naps. She wakes up around 12:00 or 1:00, depending on how she slept throughout the night. I eat while she is napping, too.  When she wakes up she has a bottle, then plays and coos on her playmat.  At about 2:00, I run errands.  It usually takes about an hour for me to do my errands, so were back by 3:00 or 3:30.  When we get home, she has some tummy time, then a bottle.  After her bottle, I play with her for a little bit.  At about 5:00, I hand her off to my mom, until about 8:00.(Between 5:00 and 8:00 I work)  When I come home, I play with her, bathe her, give her a bottle, and lay her down.  She does to bed around 9:00    School days:  I get up at 6:50 to shower and get ready for school.  Rya wakes up at 7:45 and I get her ready for daycare.  We leave the house by 8:10, so I can drop her off at daycare before school.  I pick her up from daycare around 3:30.  We then run some errands since we're already out and about.  We get home around 5:00 and she has a bottle.  After her bottle we have some mommy and me time.  We play for about an hour before I put her in her bouncer or swing so I can eat.  At about 7:30 I let my mom have her for about 30 minutes so I can start homework.  At 8:00, she gets fed, has a bathe, a story and is down for bed by 9:00.    I work Tuesdays, Thursdays, and every other Saturday.
Ybo6HS8Caa	I agree with you 100000%!  Kids these days do have too much power, and they know it.  In my opinion, that's why our jails are so full and there are so many unwanted babies.  In my house, I have the power, and my kids know it.  My middle one decided last week that she didn't like the color of the paint on her walls, so she proceeded to pick off the paint and wall paper.  As a result, her walls have been completely stripped, down to the wood, and she will have nothing for quite some time; until I feel that she can be trusted not to tear up MY house.  My kids either eat what I made for dinner, or they can go without.  It's up to them.  I am not a short order cook and will not have my children barking orders at me.  But at the same time, I do things with my kids.  I am a cub scout leader.  I take them to and attend all their practices and games, etc.  There has to be a balance of discipline and support for parenting to be effective.  Just my opinion.|`|FvhCUHjxaa	The government doesn't give children power; some parents just don't know how to raise or discipline and are too soft with their children. No offense but I would never want to be your child. Kids need to learn to form opinions and I'll be damned as an adult if my parents went through my purse/ personal belongings because I live at home.|`|QveBSjFSaa	On the off chance that there may actually be abused kids in need, the government has put regulations on what is and is not appropriate for children.  And, as with any good thing, you have your dregs looking, and finding loopholes.  It contributes towards this generation's stigma that they are filled with a sense of entitlement.|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I blame the Democrats, The Great Ronald Reagan would never have stood for the things that go on today and he knew how to keep the crazy liberals in their place..  He is greatly missed.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Maury is a bunch of CRAP. It's a talk show that needs to keep its ratings up and does so by over-dramatizing one solitary event.     Parents can spank, ground, yell at, deduct allowance, or otherwise punish their kids any way they want. There's an old saying, "My house, my rules." Parents can monitor ANYTHING and EVERYTHING their kids do. Any lawyer who would side with the kid is a moron who wants money and notoriety, not justice.     On the other hand, YOU cannot "take away their beds and make them sleep on the floor, make them hand-wash their own clothes, starve them" and everything else you said. That's not discipline, that's abuse. The parent must provide for (NOT SPOIL) the child.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	are you blind?  kids have zero power these days  why do you think they are rebelling so much  they are denied basic human rights     your going to be a hated parent   with miserable kids who will grow up bitter and angry|`|2jMFurDoaa	when i was a teenager my dad blatantly when thru my stuff, flipped my matress,went thru my closet, read note, checked IMs, my mom was more secretive i guess she'd read stuff i wrote and all but she didnt tell me until i was older i never did anything seriously bad like the kids on Maury, but it still got on my nerves it felt like they didnt trust me.     now im kind of glad because it deterred me from doing bad things. if my dad yells at me for say F*** in a note i dont want him to catch me drinking at a party. Lol    I always threatened to call the cops, my dad would tell me to tell them to bring an ambulance because id be dead when they got here. i mean at the time it seemed really psychotic but now i just laugh at it and my parents and i have a great relationship.    whenever i talked back i got hot pepper in my mouth.     it actually scares me a little, when i have kids, am i not allowed to punish them for doing bad things? am i supposed to let them run wild and have sex and drink at the age of 12 and not do anything about it except go on Maury?     Lol it seriously has gotten ridiculous.|`|DPegPYRPaa	I think that is is the parents fault and nobody else. Unless they are 18, the parent should have a say in everything that child does and how they are punished, unless it is threatning their well being.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	its not the goverment its the parents and everything you say u would do to ur kids is illegal|`|ghz5D5iLaa	The parents that refuse to be a parent are the ones that give those kids the power. If my kids want to call  Children services they are free to do so but when they show up they can leave with them. The need to face the consequences for their actions. My children do not talk back and their stuff is monitored. I do not go through there stuff and their bedrooms, I have never had a reason but I would if I did. The government has protective services there for the hundreds of kids that do need it, not for brats that the parents made.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	What is it with the police these days, I can't even hit old women with out them freaking out jeez. I can't even hit my wife in my house which I pay for, the government have gone to far. These days children actually have rights you can't beat them with a stick then lock them in the basement, there there my heart bleeds.    What if you were a stay at home Dad and your wife worked would you still agree to the "I pay the bills" logic? Or when you're old and live with your adult children, can they beat and starve you if they wish?    Why do people like you even have children? You obviously care more about your ego than them turning out mentally retarded.
q5MGxuyaaa	You probably just skipped a month and haven't ovulated yet.  That means you could still be fertile, so get busy!!  Blood tests are usually pretty accurate.  Goodluck!!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	I'm sorry but the blood test would be able to detect even the slightest level of HCG hormone. Keep positive, and Goodluck.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	The Blood test is the end of all...if it comes back negative then you are not pregnant. Maybe you have stressed yourself out and caused a missed period? I have done that before..we are trying so desperately..Good Luck to you!|`|9ALwHYZaaa	hope this helps:   On the 7th January i had one light pink spot of blood and when i was due on my period on the 11th January it never arrived. On the 3rd February I started to bleed with the flow of a normal period but now Ive had literally a spot of blood all day.    I expected that I missed the period on the 11th due to stress but I was expecting my next one to arrive by the 15th February, so either this period (if thats what it is) has arrived early or very late.    Me and my partner have had unprotected sex about 7 times whilst my period was missing/uptil the bleeding.    I had a blood test for HCG on the 17th Jan and was negative and all urine tests negative last week.    I dont understand whats going on, do you?    am i pregnant, do i have mixed up hormones? I am not under any stress or on any b/c pills    I have had a history of low HCG with my last pregnancy but I honestly do not feel pregnant.
Cg4fWi3Baa	For me this is hard to answer because many people do the exact things you are talking about however not all people who are on welfare are like this and some of them genuinely need the assistance.   On the other hand it does upset me that we pay taxes, pay $60 to see a doctor, more for medication, full price groceries, no discount on bills, full daycare/kinder/school fees..etc.  I know a woman who has 6 children and has had 2 miscarriages and 3 abortions who claims welfare for all 6 of her kids. She owns her own home, hotted up car, and she has not worked a day in 17yrs. (This is how old her eldest child is.) She really is a downright troll and cases like this disgust me. She doesn't even look after her kids. The oldest 2 babysit the rest everyday, she feeds them junk all the time, they don't bathe regularly and it doesn't bother her that their are mice crawling throughout her kitchen. On top of this, her ex husband is exempt from paying child support for violence issues (which means here is aust, she gets a bit more cash from taxpayers) and yet she still sleeps with him regularly. I think people like her continue to do this beause the government don't review these cases enough, and when they do perform follow ups, it's over the phone.   The only thing people can do to stop bludging parents like this is to complain to authorities and hope they take action.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Apparently they can't afford birth control either??|`|7AYnWg3paa	u think people on welfare get back thousands of dollars back?? HA.....YES,honestly there are some people who suck up and are just lazy people and never work...seen many ppl on the projects like that but there are others that are just in a bad position and use it TEMPORARILY until they can get back on there feet in which i see no problem with...they wouldnt be given it if they didnt need it...i personally do not judge people simply because they have government assistance because it is not my place too...and really its not ures either|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	health care should be a right of every citizen of this country.  not just people who have money or it is offered in their work.    i believe you are talking about the minority not the majority.|`|r07BwhO1aa	It does make me kinda upset when people abuse the system, but there are those out there who need it badly, you can't punish the good because of the bad.    What upsets me is when people just assume that they do not have to work, these are help outs not hand outs. These systems are made to help get people on their feet not become the main and often only source of income.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I'm pretty sure you would receive some different answers if you worded this nicely. Basically you can't always control what you're handed in life. Condom break. Birth control fails. Partners pass away. People lose jobs. There are many different reasons why people are on welfare and not all of them are bad    EDIT: As for people keep on having children, I honestly don't know. Maybe they feel entitled to welfare? Maybe they don't believe in birth control. Some people don't believe in abortion or even adoption. I think welfare is a good thing for people that really need it, but not for people that abuse it to no end|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think a lot of people have children just so they can get welfare.  It's disgusting.      I used to work at a sub shop, and I saw a family with 8 children come in(no more than a year apart in age.) The parents had nice clothes on, like babyphat and abercrombie stuff...while their kids were wearing raggedy clothes that looked like they were 4 sizes too big.  I think a lot of parents do it for their benefit, and I feel bad for the children.    My mom is on welfare.. but for the first time in 16 years.  She lost her job because she's sick, and my dad and her are divorced.  Things are hard.  Don't be so quick to judge.  Once, I was with my mom at Wal mart, cashing her check, and some asshole behind us said some crap about how he has to wait in line while all these white trash people cash their welfare checks.  I turned around and snapped on his a$$ soo bad.  I just wanted to share that :p    Oh, and btw, my mom got 300 dollars back.. not thousands.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	so the parents whose birthcontrol fails and then the husband loses his job should just go and abort the baby, you are saying? nice  I know there is some people who abuse the system but you cant always control what happens and thats why its important that there is systems to help people who need it.    We got back thousands of dollars from taxes and my kids have free health care. I would much rather be making so much money that I wouldnt qualify for the child income credit because with the money we do make, we barely survive, and we cant afford to go back to school so we could get better jobs.   Since you know it all why dont you tell me what to do?Should I just leave my kids home alone all day to go back to school to make more money?    edit. And by the way, that is all we receive. ( medicaid and WIC)|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	actually since the welfare reforms of the 1990s, you do not get paid on a per-child basis, and as a result out-of-wedlock births have gone down substantially
AA11315360	They can have a baby until they reach age of menopause (where they no longer get periods). I think the oldest woman or women to have a baby is age 60 or late 50s.   Most women go through menopause ages 45-60.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	not to old if she hasnt gone throught the change all together|`|aaZ0cTdCaa	Any age before menopause (appx 50 yrs)   There are more complications the older you get tho, like higher risk for miscarriage|`|CG5L6Fm6aa	maybe 45 before menopause of course|`|ttT7W77gaa	93
wiAVa1H5aa	How about names that are red neck or trailer trash?   Like Bobby Jo, Carol Ann, Dolly, Lorrie, Dewayne, Buddy, Bud...    BTW there is no such thing as race, there is only economic strata and tribes, we are genetically not unique to even qualify as having subspecies in humans so I do not feel there is any good way to qualify folks as being of a different race.   Well, that's coming from my biological/evolutionary/geneticist/anthr... thinking, at most we come from familial moieties.   The real difference you are illustrating here with those names is not ghetto or African American, it's economic stratas - same with trailer trash vs. middle class names.   Your "ethnic" names were likely researched and meanings decided on (think educated parents) while the "ghetto" names were names that the parents liked the sound of and often combined names to make a name they liked to hear instead of ones that had meanings that were important to the parents.   Same deal with "Bobby Jo", perhaps my least favorite name of all time.|`|odEAUvHDaa	I would just have to say that ethnic names have meanings, and are special to the name-ees. But, "ghetto" names just seem to be thrown out there to be different, and frankly sometimes hard to pronounce! I have no problem with either, but I think the 'ethnic' way is a much more repsectable route! =)|`|pV1vhEvAaa	I agree with you. It seems like most ghetto names are just random letters with a La- or De- or Ja- in front. Ethnic names are unusual, but when you see them, or hear them, they don't evoke images of the girl in your 7th grade history class named Shaniqua. (B/c everyone's been in class with that girl) Ethnic names seem to have an air of class, even though I may have never heard the name.
qsPyi6Mhaa	oh man...    That's a hard one. How old is your kid? you know what they say. A lie is a lie is alie.    But communication is the key. Just let your child now that the truth always comes out in the end, and that he/she is effecting everyone in the house by telling lies. I caught my son in a lie once and I sat him down an explained exactly that. He cried like a baby. i tried not to get angry at him, but naturally that is a reaction. Just sit him or her down, and talk. That is what worked for me. Sorry is this isn't the best advice. Good luck with that.|`|zpSjcCo3aa	Trust him|`|3Psi4kBxaa	It depends on the age of your child.   I have no idea how old your is ?  Sorry I can't say as I don't know.|`|AA11828439	Be the parent. Refuse to stand for it. Punish it every time.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Lying is a huge deal in our house - they get the whooping of a lifetime - needless to say it something we rarely need to deal with - they've learned to tell the truth.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Give him a reason to tell the truth. If my kids started telling me lies I would think that they are doing so because they don't trust me.|`|nrQijvMuaa	So far my son hasn't lied to me yet. But if he does Ill prob tell him that his nose will grow like Pinocchio.! =)|`|jkgl9WMgaa	If my child admits the truth when they have done something wrong, they will be disciplined according to the severity of the "crime".  If my child lies when confronted, they will receive a much harsher punishment. They have the consequence of the original action and then added on for the lie.  If your child knows for a fact that lying only gets him in more trouble, not less, then he may stop.  I have let my children know that I see that as a sign of disrespect and I don't tolerate it.
66cb1b024847c91f73947f8666fdf56daa	There shouldn't be any visible cuts. With adenoids, they will go up your nose to get them out and there are no cuts with tubes. I had my adenoids an tonsils out when i was five and i had tubes when i was three and again when i was five. Just tell her that they are going to fix her ears so that they wont hurt anymore. Tell her its not going to hurt her and that when she wakes up after a nap she'll be all better.|`|HEvSVMeVaa	One thing to remember is that this will probably be more of a scarier experience for you than for her. When I was her age I had a tympanoplasty, a patch put over my ear drum. Before that I also had tubes. I don't remember the tubes going in or anything about that. But I do still remember going to the hospital with my teddy bear, mom, and grandma. I can also remember the night before when my mom was really nervous. What I'm getting to is, my mom and doctor were really honest with me and told me what was going to happen. After that I was excited to never have to where ear plugs again when I even went near water.    Good luck with the surgery! I'm sure everything will be fine!

mIky7uoQaa	Well that sounds just like Norway. The government pays child support, even married couples who are living together get 200 dollars a month for every child. Medical and Dental is free for all children, and about 5 dollars a visit for adults. All hospitals and surgeries, travel costs etc are free. Its a good life here. I am an American, my ex owes me over 20 grand in child support, nothing has been done about it. So from my stand point, the American government is a piece of ****, and I sure as hell love my life in Norway! It feels good to be taken care of!    Children don't base their love on the amount of money the parents make or give to each other. Anyone who tries to instill that money is more important than a parent's love is selfish and morally wrong.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	First I have to say that "in America" it is ILLEGAL to withhold children from their parents because he/she isn't paying child support. Second, do you think it's fair that this man gets all the fun of being a father without any of the responsibilities. Instead the responsibilities of that go to the taxpayers of your country. Just because her dad pays taxes it doesn't mean that he is paying enough in taxes to support his child, not to mention that the rest of us support our children AND pay taxes. Yeah I'm sure she will like him because he is her daddy, that doesn't make it right for her mother to have to live off welfare so that her dad can buy her something as stupid and trivial as earrings.|`|EYYNtf3Gaa	Not sure if this is a real post or not. Seems like there is a little too much la la and sarcasm. Yes it is good to have a relationship with both parents. But, as we all know, it takes M-O-N-E-Y to raise children, And BOTH parents should be responsible for raising the children.    Sure there are Government subsidies to help us in a time of need. But the ultimate responsibility is with the Parents.  May you find Strength in Your Higher Power,  GranPa Chuck,  Visit our Site: http://nfpcar.org|`|AA11537580	doesn't matter where you live or what the law is you should still give the mother money to help raise the child.

Some country's are on par with the US but no country exceeds it.  The American health care system is better than the ones in the wel fare country's because people have to pay, except the lazy bums who have government health care, so people only go when they are sick.  We may have to wait in line if we are sick but surgery wait times are in days or weeks even for elective surgery's not years.    Also when you pay for things you have more room to complain so that gets you better treatment.|`|Ew2wC9piaa	well just because she sees him all the time does not mean that she will like him before my mom moved us to texas we saw our dad all the time but i now know that when he was with us it was just an act he put on. he did pay child support and thank god my mom had my step father because what my dad paid was not enough to pay for 2 kids and after the move he hardly called or anything of the sort. now that i am grown i can see how foolish i was to think that my dad was the best. he helped me get a truck and i ran into some bad times my fiance and i both lost our jobs and so i lost the truck and since than i have had a baby who will soon be 1year old and he has not sent anything to him not even a card. i have not got anything as far as christmas or my birthday for 2 years now and he tells me that when he gets some extra money he will send some but he can afford to but 3 plane tickets for my brother there and back once just my brother and the other 2 were for him and his girlfriend just this thanksgiving so just because he buys her stuff does not mean she will like him. he has to be there for her in other ways as well or its a lost relationship. sorry for the rant but my dad was really lazy during the time we did not see him and when we did he was all about being with us.  and now that he acts like he does not have a grandson hurts me more than him not talking to me i even sent him a card with tons of pics of the baby to him for christmas but he keeps forgetting them at his moms. if he really cared he would not forget them and they would be hanging up at his house for all to see.

I worked for a sub shop, and the dishes were the nastiest I'd ever seen in my life.. and I only got 100 bucks every other week for that crap.    snagajob.com is helpful, by the way :}|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	Age is relative to the state you live in, and subject to the individual employer. There are some federal guidelines on the books but since you requested, I'll skip those.     Generally speaking, the youngest a state will allow someone to work for a wage is 13. However, you will rarely find an employer that will hire anyone under the age of 16. An electronics store I used to work for refused to hire anyone under 18 (for security reasons). The exception tends to be in more rural areas where people work on farms. I met a 14 year old who spend 6 hours a day driving a tractor once.|`|lPzoVwjXaa	12|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	How about three day old(as newborn for movie, tv, commercial etc.)  Okay, a lttle too young for that, I would guess.

When graduating, my middle school split up our 8th graders between two different high schools. I wound up going to the new school, and couldn't have been happier to get the hell out of there.     The problem is that kids your age unconsciously exclude others as a way to make themselves feel better. Its nothing that you did, its just you were unlucky enough to be the one they all piled on. Or piled away from I guess.     Don't take it personally. Find things that make you happy (gym, music, singing, acting, sports etc.) and do them. Alot. Not only will you pass the time with something that makes you happy, but eventually you meet up with tons of people who have similar interests to you.     Stick with it.

gMoDyoJvaa	stick a m60 in it and lite it|`|BjQcwGSLaa	insert your thumb into the nasal cavity. With your index finger pressing the thumb from the outside, wiggle the thumb in search of gooey stuff.

If you should hit a small squishy substance it is probably your brain and you have gone in too far. Remove finger and choose next nostril.

Just remember you can pick your nose and you can pick your friends, but you can't wipe your friends on the couch.|`|SC91Uwrhaa	with your finger or a tissue|`|6PaGQaqKaa	EPIC FAIL!!! loser|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, okay.

And good luck.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	The Thumb-Finger Method       1. Position the index finger of the opposite-side hand alongside the exterior of the obstructed channel.     2. Nonchalantly slip the thumb as deep as necessary into the nostril.     3. Using the thumbnail, delicately clamp onto the dried mucous mass.     4. Slowly withdraw the thumb and it's payload from the nostril. At this step in the process be particularly vigilant for any trailing mucous which might be attached to the payload. These un-noticed "stringers" can jeopardize the entire operation.     5. Return the hand to a more natural position and discreetly execute a flicking motion with the thumb. This should launch the material sufficiently far away from you that it becomes someone else's problem.     6. Remember...never wipe it on your shirt or trousers - its always a dead giveaway.     7. Always beware of flicking too hard. If the offending article sticks to the ceiling, it'll be there forever.      The Advanced Hand-Guard Method       1. Slightly cup the left hand and position it so that your forefinger is below your right eye and your thumb is below your left eye. The palm will be hiding the nostrils from onlookers who will be convinced that you are rubbing your cheeks as one does when trying to ease the symptoms of a headache, or of weariness, (simultaneously closing one's eyes makes the tactic even more effective).     2. In a natural, confident motion bring the right hand up and under the left hand. Use the right index finger to probe, acquire and extract the residual material. After returning the right hand to a secure location execute a flicking maneuver to eject the material.      The Athletic Nose-blow       1. If you find your mineshaft quite often gets cave-ins you may find this a useful technique to clear blocked passages. This does require a bit of exercise, so if you have a condition which makes exerting yourself dangerous then you might want to steer clear of this method.     2. First, work yourself up to a nice sweat. This will get the blood circulating in all parts of the body including your head. Once this has been accomplished while you're running, or performing whatever exercise, have a quick glance around to make sure no one is looking, casually turn you're head out of line-of-sight, take a deep breath, close your mouth and push all the air from your lungs as well as the offending road-block in one explosive breath. You may be saying to yourself, "How is this inconspicuous". This can be done both effectively and inconspicuously even if people are around under the guise of a feigned sneeze. Voila! Enjoy a nice deep breath through your newly cleared olfactory mines.      The Fake Cough       1. Fake a cough slightly while bringing your hand up to your mouth (as if to cover the cough).     2. Raise your index finger up to the nostril that's bothering you.    The Turnaround       1. Slowly excuse yourself and slowly turn around. Extract material from nose quickly and keep your hand down on your lap. Then, when you are talking to somebody and they have their full attention to your face, flick material into the world.    The Hair Wipe       1. After a nosepick has been executed and there is a sign that it has occurred (mucus) casualy rub nose with palm and follow through, act like you are combing hair out of your eyes with your fingers then return hand to side. After this, to remove nasal waste from hand, wipe on the back knee of pants or the cuff of your pants.|`|60UGQvMSaa	Grab your favorite pizza cutting knife out of the cabinet, and ram it up your nose as fast and as hard as you can.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Grow just a little bit of nail.

7cvoxQitaa	I have had a very high miscarriage rate. I lost 7. I am blessed with one!   I have learned that before a miscarriage starts, you feel extreme abdominal cramping, kinda like a period from HELL!! If you think you may be pregnant, the best thing to do is to STOP everything, and rest!! Lie down with your legs propped up. Do nothing and stay that way until the pain goes away.   Not sure about happening after going to the restroom, because I always got them in the morning while I was doing nothing.   During the first trimester is the worst time, especially for those of us who have high miscarriage rates. Just take things easy and very slow!!!   Don't lift things AT ALL. Don't streatch over your head, don't get hit in the tummy. DO NOT get stressed out at all!!! High miscarriage risk pregnancys are hard, very hard. But, with good prenatal care, it is possible!     OH!!!!! Go to Wal-Mart.. get the prenatal listening thing. It's a thing you strap to your belly and listen with headphones, you can hear your baby's heartbeat! It was only like $20. It was priceless when ever I would get worried about me losing my daughter. A wonderful piece of equipment!!  Good luck! *hugs*|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It isn't contractions.

I drove 200 miles every few weeks to be with her and care for her.  She died last May and it is very hard to understand why this had to happen.  The only thing that helps is to know she is better off where she is now because she was so sick but I know that doesn't help you since your friend had an accident that took her suddenly.  I just try to remember all the great times we had together and we have mutual friends that I talk with about her which helps.  It somewhat has gotten to the point where I am at ease with it but she is always on my mind.  I wish the best for you.  You must have been a very good friend to her.  Good Luck!|`|15f6b966548342c93376b6b04d89a61caa	First of all, i can totally feel your pain, even though the death of a friend has never happened to me and i hope it never does but i feel so bad for you. my life is very hard emotionally and the pressure is hard to take but when things are so hard for me, i listen to sad songs and do as many things that make me sader and sader and sader untill i am so misrible i cant take it, so then, i relize...(say this out loud)     "why am i making my self so misrible. i cant be doing this. i cant let this one tragic moment or event take over my whole life. im a strong, beautiful, nice, inteligant girl and im not going to let this one thing no matter if it is life changing or not tare me down and take over my life, im going to pick my self up raise my head high and stand tall, because for every minute of hert and sorrow and every second of pain, their is just as many, probably a lot more of the happy and good time that im feeling. i will not let my self go, and i will not waste one more second of my life. Today i am free at last!!!!!"    and you will pick your self up and feel like a brick is lifted up of your sholder you can breath again.    im really sorry this happened to you, but dont let this one incident ruin your life. take a deep breath and smile and keep on walking. That is what your friend would have wanted you to do.|`|AA11542772	i did when my aunt died|`|AA10545025	My husband was murdered 5 1/2 years ago. I always feel him around. I also do see people who look like him. It just means that she is still in your heart. But do look for other ways of closure. That way, you can don't feel like your having an anxiety attack when you think of her.|`|AA11847420	My husband went through this.  With the loss of his father and sister in such a close amount of time.  Well, it's been 5 years in now since they have passed away.  My husband went through many stages.  He would have bad dreams and good dreams about them both.  Things got pretty bad with my husband.  He went to counseling a lot and without it I don't think he would be where he is today.  He also went on an anti-depressant.  He was so sad all the time, he wanted to feel better.  He got a lot better.  I think since you are a mom urself you have to think of ur precious daughter having a sad mommy.  If you are really sad a lot go to the doctor and tell them this.  You might need something to help you get better.  I don't think the pain of losing loved ones ever goes away.  What I remind my husband is how much I knew his Dad and sister loved him. That his dad would be so proud of him now with what he has done with his life.  Last of all I remind him that his dad wouldn't want him to be sad over him all of the time.  We talk about all the happy memories with his Dad & Sister.  Those memories can never be taken away.  We keep those thought forever in our hearts.  Maybe god bless you and give you the strength to get through this.  Turn all ur sadness into love of ur child.  I think ur friend would be all for that!|`|90e60fec07151b5e72164350572b006aaa	...|`|AA11881970	Oh, my, well, just know that my prayers are with you. When I start thinking a bout a lost loved one, I like to talk about it with another friend, but that's just me.
qr8mlDqXaa	It depends on HOW you do it. I wouldn't just straight up ask her, I'd talk to her and sort of lead the conversation in that direction, then ask her. I think if you ask her out of no where it might scare her a bit.     It also depends on your relationship with her.     Good luck!|`|c4RT0sFOaa	ask her on a date... if she says yes then she likes you.. if she's avoiding it then maybe no...    good luck ! :)|`|HnCUC1YIaa	well...us girls do like guys saying things to us in person. i think you should go up to her and say..."listen, i really like you and its ok if you don't like me back i just wanted you to know." and if you say that than she will understand you just want her respect. then she might considor you|`|zgDxpqRsaa	well da worste dat could happen is her sayin no but u know jus flirt a lil n make things less awkward|`|VS8mactUaa	Well coming right out may make you nervous but it shows maturity, and girls do tend to like guys, not little boys :) So I say Go for it!!! Good Luck!|`|CpCBxiIOaa	talk to her. if she knows and she's not ignoring you or giving you a weird vibe, then talk to her. take her out to lunch or something. express how you feel..without creeping her out! lol|`|jNwkgcTCaa	Well it depends. . . does she like you back?  Do you talk to her enough and established a "friend" relationship?  If so, maybe.  I need more information. . . sorry.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I don't think it would creep her out. However, I think if she was into you she probably would have told your friend "Oh, I really like him too!"|`|Rj3epU5yaa	you never know unless you try.  so i say go up to her real smooth like and say something like, "my genius of a friend spilled the beans, so you know how i feel, would you like to go out with me sometime?"|`|w1pbRmazaa	yes, if you do it sweetly it will be impressive|`|DI8m0wXPaa	It doesn't hurt to try, since your friend already told her.|`|noUZuLV8aa	creep her out ??    of course not ..    she didnt give any bad impression when she heard u like her..    go for her and ask her out ..    way to go hunk  ;)|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	tell her. she knows already, so i think she would be flattered. you would probably already know if it creeped her out. Valentines day is coming maybe you could ask her to do something on that day. She would think  that is sweet|`|6OAED55paa	this happened to me too! i let it circulate for a little while, trying to see if maybe id get a reaction out of her...    long story short I couldnt take it anymore and ended up going to her in private and just telling her. i said "i think you deserve to hear something from me, and thats that i like you...and I heard its going around and thats messed up you should hear it from me...etc"    she really appreciated the honesty and respect in that, and even though it wasnt mutual i had peace of mind and knew to move on. hope this helps...|`|f105f8c5b433047713f238437a820d45aa	Does she like you? If you KNOW she likes you for sure, I think you should straight up and tell her. She will be flattered.  I dont think you would creep her out.     And ask her out on a date! :] Maybe ask her to be your date for Val's day ;]|`|UE3smuAJaa	YES TELL HER!! its the best thing you can do when you are sure she knows you like her! try to act if you diddnt already know, girls like the bravery and honesty.|`|Nn63rf9Eaa	It depends really. Everyone is different. For me I wouldn't be creeped out at all, it's normal and nothing to be creeped out about. She might be impressed, everyone is different. It really all depends on how she is so it's hard to tell. Good luck though.|`|Hp1rNHduaa	You should just tell her.    Say something like:  Hey, I think you're really pretty and nice and great or whatever    That wouldn't creep me out
AA10624857	I've been a mom for 29 years to 4 kids.  I guess I can't agree that children's clothing is a controversial subject.  I might have some issues with what my kids want to wear (such as the same jeans every day of the week), but I certainly am not at odds with other parents over what their kids are wearing.  I do think the subject of stay-at-home mom versus "working" mom is a subject that often causes people to choose sides.  Another issue that can be divisive is whether to vaccinate or not vaccinate your children.  That subject can be controversial.  There's also the breast feeding vs. formula feeding issue that's good for some interesting discussion.  Since most of my kids are older now, one of the things often discussed in parenting circles was the idea of forbidding our kids to drink at home until they were 21 or the idea that since the are "going to do it anyway" to let underage kids drink in your home.  Now, that was a controversial topic depending on who you were with.  Of course, if you want to get things going, you can always bring up the subject of spanking, that's good for some interesting conversations as well.  I guess children's clothing is certainly small potatoes when it comes to most of these other subjects.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Vaccinations/no vaccinations  teaching your child about God/not teaching them   breastfeeding vs. bottle feeding  cloth vs. disposable diapers  spanking vs. no spanking  Let them cry it out/not cry it out    These are the ones I can think of off the top of my head that come up here on a regular basis.|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	stay at home mom/dad vs working parents  single parents vs. couples  daycare vs staying at home   to vaccinate vs not to  to breastfeed vs formula feed  to spank vs not to  to homeschool vs public or private school  to let them watch tv vs limit or ban it   regular diapers vs cloth   adoption vs abortion  pro life vs pro choice     theres a ton|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Children's clothing?

Here are the topics I think are the most controversial    Disposable vs cloth diapers  Spanking  Pro-life vs pro-choice  Co-sleeping  Breastfeeding vs formula  Daycare|`|VVQv9GX1aa	I'd say the biggest ones would be:    Breastfeeding Vs Formula  &  Whether to circumcise or not.    I've seen a lot of debates on here about those ones.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	spanking, circumcision, cellphones|`|JWmg6Ys8aa	You can check out this site it has lots of answers to all such questions on parenting...I just happened to bang into it in google.

33361f975202a28024124ac0b9d8b821aa	Hey we are due date twins!  Go March 24th babies!    I can't lie to you and say I am enjoying every moment of this stage of my pregnancy.  I'm fatigued, uncomfortable and having some joint pains.  Your doctor is either wacko or has never been pregnant.  Have you ever noticed how quickly some women forget how taxing pregnancy can be on your body and emotions?  Just try to enjoy it when you can and don't feel bad about it if you have off days.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	i am almost in my last trimester and i have hated being pregnant i hate the cramps, peeing all the time, fatigue, her kicking my bladder, being unable to fit anywhere, heartburn, and just not having control over my body and the 7 months of morning sickness i am just so ready to meet her i have no patients! I have never felt so old, and sick in my life like i said the months of morning sickness i have just felt like i have almost aged 50 yrs like i said i love my daughter and can't wait to meet her but i just can't wait to dye my hair, whiten my teeth, go get a tan, and just be a mommy! i can't wait either!|`|62vCoDPjaa	well im trying to live it up (to what extent is the question)  im in the early part of my third trimester so i havent gotten very uncomfortable yet.  i try to see all my friends as often as possible now- knowing that most of them are around my age and single and guys since thats mostly what i work with..and they just arent interested in hanging around when i have a crying baby to take care of.  plus im trying to do all my cleaning and arranging before i get too big to do so!|`|8PA7ndf8aa	This is my fourth pregnancy. I would go out and enjoy a nice sit down dinner. With my other three every time I had dinner made and sat down to eat the baby would start to cry. Then there the feeling you are forever connect to the baby and you can't leave it behind, so you never have time for yourself. You think you are tired now, wait until you are up every two hours feeding the baby. Getting up and peeing just gets you ready. I know it seems hard. It is hard to see the other side unless you been there. Everyone kept telling me the same thing. Do it now before the baby comes. They were right. I didn't have my mom around to help. I hope you ladies have some support to help you. I will tell you it is all worth it. To hold that baby is awesome. Until then go have a pedicure, get your hair done, go out to eat. Do something special for yourself. You are going to deserve it. Congrats on the baby.|`|LABC73E7aa	i feel the same!|`|tj0X2YaYaa	Yeah people always say "Oh just you wait until the baby comes..." but at least with the baby on the outside of your body you get at least some portion of a normal body back.  You can bend over, your ankles aren't swollen, your back doesn't hurt, you can breathe (that will be my personal favorite!) and you don't have to go to the bathroom every half hour or less.  All of the things that I can't do right now.  I'm not sleeping anyway, so I might as well just be able to do other things, right?  I think people just forget how uncomfortable the end of pregnancy is because now they have to plan around the baby as well as themselves when they go out, which I can understand can be a hassle, but at least you are able to feel physically capable of doing it!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'm  32 weeks now and would say I am more uncomfortable and anxious than I am enjoying it! I agree that it is good advice to try and enjoy it but I seriously think people forget how miserable pregnant women get in their third trimester...lol like pregnancy amnesia! I'm going uh, I can't sleep now and have chronic insomnia anyhow, at least if the baby was on the outside of me I could bend over again. :]    As far as what else you can do, you can always go out to dinner, do some prenatal yoga (which makes you feel awesome), get a massage, facial, or pedicure (something to pamper yourself), work on a baby book/scrapbook, etc.|`|ytE1q20taa	Yes I feel like that too. Apart from going in the car to pick my brother up from school and then popping in to Morrison's on the way back I never leave the house because I feel the same way. I have 10 weeks and 6 days to go and it's going so slow. Me and my fiance are so excited for our son to arrive for both reasons, being able to do more stuff and being able to hold him :)  Congratulations btw.
MtoIxY6Qaa	payton, averie sue is cute tho! :)|`|Ti476VHkaa	Paetyn, and her middle name should be Marie. That would be cute.|`|b4IK780Raa	Both are spelled wrong.   But I like Paeton.    Alternate Spelling-    Peyton  Avery|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Averie.....but Avery|`|MPc0kS1vaa	averie|`|ylgNuE3uaa	They're both great, but I like Averie best if you are going to spell them as shown. :)|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Averie :)|`|nz1DolZJaa	I like Peyton, but I like it spelt Peyton. I mean, I little variation is okay, but make it easy to read, because I look at your spelling and at first glance, you might has well have wrote: Pajhfd|`|nOzQUsToaa	Averie is way better|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	well im going to name my baby girl peatyn.  so im gonna tell you averie so that there isnt alot of paetyn's out there.   lol|`|jGhX7H5taa	Averie or avery....paetyn is spelled weird...|`|XbKbsSzfaa	I think it's spelled Payton. Anyways, it's adorable!|`|coVZ1uqCaa	Paetyn. But I kinda prefer the orignal version, which is Peyton. But this is nice, too. (:    -----|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Averie|`|4547eab5ec2a01595d1f92cd2bc3c40aaa	I like payton better- sorry I forgot how you had it spelled though- plus it can go both ways- boy or girl|`|XyKLc3xOaa	I like Averie the best!    Peyton, I don't know...it's also a guy's and and it reminds me of Peyton Manning who I don't like much at all.    Good luck!|`|z02wVf3laa	Payton not Paetyn but I think that it is a very cute name|`|glGVuKAEaa	How about just spelling them:  Payton/Peyton and Avery?    I don't really love either, but Avery is better.|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	I hate the name Paetyn. It reminds me of that ***** off of one tree hill...

jBnQiZVFaa	Although you can attempt to just keep it the regular name without nicknames, often they emerge anyway.  I have several cousins who were Robert and Matthew, until high school hit...then it all gets jumbled up.  Lots of kids are not confident enough to stop people from calling them nicknames and sometimes the kids just don't mind. Just because you don't like the nickname, doesn't mean she won't adopt it anyway (especially if she happens to be a an obstinate teenager). I would always choose a name that I liked most things about (the name, the nicknames, the flow between my last name).  That way, I wouldn't have to be so anal about the nickname.  And by the way, both of my cousins are Rob and Matt now.|`|NRMGJpwUaa	I don't think it would come out as"lyd" it would most likely come out as Lia. i think that not everyone needs to have a nickname because my name is Amelia and people just call me Amelia. You should do what you think is right. Pick a name you love not what nickname it has.|`|ot0TqzSvaa	just discourage your child from having a nickname, or give her an alternate nickname. for example, if her eyes are blue call her 'blu' as a nickname, or for Lydia, Dia or La or something. Nicknames dont always have to be associated with their first name. They can be from their surname, initials, middle name, something they did, or the way they look. for example, bcuz i have blonde hair, my brothers call me blondy. and one my brother's initials are BJ, so thats his nickname. Be creative.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I say if you like a name then go with the name there is nothing that says that you have to have a nickname (or that your nickname has to be a shortened version of your name)....There is a girl I was friends with in high school whos mother refused to have her name shortened, she said if I wanted to her Kim I would have named her Kim instead of Kimberly and by the time she got to high school she was used to telling people its kKimberly not Kim not Kimmy...etc    Hope I helped|`|FgVvTnyOaa	I had the same problem when naming my son, we loved the name Alexander but did not like "Alex" at all, too common. So we added a "z" so it would be Alexzander and "Zander" for short. Now he's two and people will call him Alex but he won't even respond to it, to him he's Zander :)   Lia is a good suggestion, if you want to shorten Lydia at all. I think it's a beautiful name!|`|QcGd8ktAaa	Nicknames are inevitable.  You can't account for her future preference or the habits of others she will eventually interact with.  I chose nickname-less names for my 4 children and they are always shortened to something.  You learn to appreciate the creativity of others.  Duncan- Dunc; Gretchen- Gret, Gretta, Grettie; Joslin- Jo, Jos; Kaydon- Kayd, KD.  Even people I told that I preferred their entire name still shortened them.|`|d6e11chxaa	It depends on just how much you hate it. I mean, my mother named my sister Amelia, but hates the nickname Amy for it. She just corrects people when they call her that, but my sister doesn't mind. My mom hates the nickname, but she knows that if Amelia wants to go by Amy occasionally, it's not a big deal because it makes her happy. I just named my son James. I hate the nicknames Jim and Jimmy. I'm correcting people now, but I can live with the possibility that he'll want to go by Jim or Jimmy when he's older.    Lydia is a beautiful name! If you can deal with her possibly wanting to go by Lyd or Lyddie when she's older, go for it!|`|qpt51YeAaa	yeah, i wanna name my kid Addison, but would puke all over myself if anyone called him "Addy" hahaha  My name is Ashly, and sometimes people call me ash.  yeah. ash like ash tray.  hahahaha  gross    lydia reminds me of beetle juice  aaaaaaand if i HAAD to shorten it (which probably wont happen) i'd call her "Dia"   like "dee uh"  but that sounds dumb too, and no one will call her "lid"  hahaha|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Then you call your daughter Lydia and encourage others to do so as well. If someone refers to her as Lyd or another nickname, all you have to do is say, "Actually, we prefer to call her Lydia" I knew a little girl named Lydia and honestly, I never heard anyone call her Lyd or another nicknames. My parents named me Melissa and I never had anyone call me by a nickname because they called Melissa.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I know a Lydia and nobody has ever called her Lyd. I can't imagine calling her anything but Lydia. And all she has to tell people if they shorten it is that she prefers Lydia.     My brother is Robert - not Rob, Bob, Bobby, Robby or anything else. He's never liked nicknames and if anyone shortens it, he just corrects them until they get it|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I know where your coming from because I love Benjamin but dislike Ben.    I would go with Lydia though because most names can be shortened down to something and some people have nicknames that are nothing to do with their names. For example I know a guy called Andrew and his nickname is Phil.    If people were to call her Lyd though you would get used to it in time and it wouldn't bother you as much. But if you don't like the name name just call her by her whole name and encourage others to do the same. If you encourage people when she's young then at least your family should get used to calling her by her whole name. The only real problem is when she goes to school and is playing with the other kids. But you either go for it or you don't. Its really depends what you think.    I would still use Benjamin even if he did get called Ben.|`|TffCSzHxaa	How about you use Lydia as a middle name?|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Lydia isn't a name that lends itself easily to shortening.  I have a cousin named Lydia and no one in our family calls her "Lyd."  In fact, I kind of think that's a hideous nickname.    If you love a name, go with it even if you don't like the nickname that is commonly associated with it.  My mother HATES the nickname "Gabby" but she chose to call me "Gabrielle" anyway knowing that most people would automatically think my nickname was "Gabby."  She has always called me "Gabe" and since that's how I introduce myself I am very rarely called by the nickname that my mom hates so much.|`|czHPPBMqaa	then dont use the nickname!|`|boqwvEvUaa	you can call her Lia, and people will follow you ;) it's cuter than Lyd, but still works for Lydia  um, i don't have a kid and i'm not planning to for a really long time, but i think cute nicknames can be made up for alot of names with at least two syllables  ;)|`|ylgNuE3uaa	It is a sure thing that people will call her Lyd at least once in a while... if you can't go for that happening  AT ALL. you would probably have to go with another name.    Lydia is pretty though... You could try to give her your own nickname like "Dia" or "Dee"  instead and maybe people will just go with that naturally when they hear you call her that.    Good luck hon'!|`|zhrGiQsKaa	i always like the names:    Scarlett (but not Scar)  Sienna (but not Sie)  etc ... i didn't use the names    my daughters name is Alexandra because i love the nicknames:Alex,Lexxa and Lexi|`|dKMpztcJaa	They could nickname her dia or Lydi.    I want to name my child estelle but i HATE Stella. So I will give her the nick name essy and she can use that when she meets other kids|`|n1mwxljzaa	my name is Alexis and my dad didnt want me to have the nickname Lexi or any nickname, he just wanted me to be called Alexis.  but a few people call me Lexi but my parents just call me Alexis, but they found nicknames for my name that they liked & i get called that.  but just tell people that you dont want her to have a nickname, & maybe as she gets older you'll find a nickname for Lydia that you do like, like my parents did with my name.  ~hope i helped :)|`|R2OMEjrhaa	My daughters name is Allyson. Her family and I call her Allyson, but at daycare they call her ally. Which is ok if her friends and other people call her ally. But thats not what I named her, and all our family, and close friends know that so that call her Allyson.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	That's ok.    My bro's name is Michael but we NEVER call him Mike.|`|tkQq5tR1aa	Make up a different nickname and let people know not to call her Lyd.
kEwLhaBwaa	I have had this for the last few days too. My AF is due on 10th feb and am hoping it is implantation. I have been pregnant twice before and lost both and never had IB with either of those pregnancies.   Then again it could just be pre AF spotting but I have never had that before either! Have been temp charting this month and had a dip yesterday and it rose up again today so fingers crossed.  Good luck honey xx|`|tE2ZHOd6aa	i have had this before i dont know what it is or why it is happening, all i no is it wont stay for long|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	How many days past ovulation are you? If you are between 7-10 you could be having implantation bleeding. I'm assuming you are trying to conceive? This could be your mth.|`|AA11112734	If you are nearing the end of your pregnancy, it could be whats called "the bloody show."  It can happen hours or days before the real contractions begin.|`|WcK800Ciaa	As uncommon as this is it may not be cause for great concern. Brown vaginal discharge is most often associated with old endometrial tissues. In other words, if your period is late you might get a brown, rather than red, discharge. It could also mean that for whatever reason during your last menses the entire uterine lining failed to make a timely exit. What you are seeing now is the fashionably late exit.     In some cases however there is cause for concern. Brown vaginal discharge can also be a symptom of a medical concern that is much more sinister than leftover endometrial cells. Some of these conditions include: cervical cancer, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), menopause or sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea, Chlamydia or genital warts.|`|2kAtqPhwaa	Hope this helps in TTC :  http://naabhi-shodha.blogspot.com/2009/0...|`|rcdTluUjaa	That could be implantation bleeding, however if it continues, you should see your doc. I had light brown spotting for 3 weeks before my period was due, it turned out I had a tubal pregnancy, and at first I didn't have any pain just the spotting. Wait a few days, and try a pregnancy test. Good luck and hopefully congratulations are in order.|`|b2TDw4VIaa	could mean your prego. It's called implantation discharge|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	could be the start of your period or if you are pregnant sometimes women get a settling period and some discharge comes away as the egg takes root in the womb is normal early on but if you are pregnant and experiencing stomach cramps it could be signs of a miscarriage|`|rRIN9RgLaa	you could be preg and u are releasing old blood...some women have this in early pregnancy from what i've heard!|`|MtjhmD8faa	That first person's comment was so rude. Good Luck figuring this out but your not the only one this has happened to. Hey it's probably happened to that rude persons Girlfriend or Mother for all he knows. He wouldn't know because this is a touchy subject that allot of women wouldn't admit. And I think your answer might be in the other comments? Also Call and Ask a Doctor !
1LjdY93Qaa	You do not have to have morning sickness to be pregnant.  I am 4 months along and haven't been sick.  Every person is different when it comes to pregnancy.  If she had a positive on a pregnancy test, then she is pregnant.  It is very rare you get a false positive, and even more to get one twice.  My advise, go to a doctor.  He can tell you for sure.  Good luck!|`|7w2kCTDJaa	No, not everyone has morning sickness. I never did at all. Being extremely tired is probably more common even than morning sickness. I would urge her to see a doctor to find out for sure.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	It isn't needed. It's a good sign, but not necessary. I was sick for the first 5 months. My sister was pregnant at the same time and hardly got sick at all, and my cousin, also pregnant at the same time felt completely fine. It varies. The best thing to do is go to the doc for blood work, and they can tell you for certain. I truly wish you the best of luck.|`|lhn1wNoeaa	Morning Sickness doesn't mean she is pregnant. You can take 1 more test after 2days. Try to take morning  urinate, so that she may have high hormone level. If she missed her period too and test is negative(if it's too late), you can make a appointment to doctor and see. Lots of baby dust on your way.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	No, some people never get it, I never got sick in the morning and so far, I'm 20 weeks and I have only gotten sick 7 times and all of them were after dinner.|`|GpR5MI5raa	no. im 6 months and havent been sick once. everybody is different when it comes to pregnancy.|`|6VZGYCZcaa	I am five weeks pregnant and I have not experienced any morning sickness. I have been extremely tired though. Congratulations, it sounds like you are going to be a dad!|`|N0rMaN3Waa	i am in the same boat, i am waiting to test so I havent had a negative yet but no positive yet either... i said the same thing about morning sicknesss as well... no morning sickness but alot of urination and sleeping... my tell taill thats convincing me is that Im waking up to urinate.. i NEVER do that.. hope you are pregos... good luck and baby dust.!|`|AA11920812	You know, with my first two I had bad morning sickness. With my last it was so bad I was on anti-nausea meds. This time around it hasn`t been bad kind of crazy that I am able to acually eat. I have a general feeling of just not wanting anything nothing looks really appetizing.    With all three of my pregnancies I never once threw up.    What kind of tests were the negs? I know not all tests are created equal. I used First Response the first two times, but this time they came out VERY light. The second one I took, took a few minutes before anything came on the screen. Very strange.    Check out this site about pg tests  www.peeonastick.com    She should get a blood test, that would tell for sure. I think the quality of the tests changes. Especially now with the economy everyone is trying to do things as cheaply as possible...meaning quality is suffering.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I never had morning sickness with either pregnancy|`|6igjX2cnaa	I want to wish you and your fiancee the best of luck and baby dust :)  Good luck with everything and I hope you get that BFP!  :) Best wishes*|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Morning sickness is not a tell-tale sign of pregnancy. While many women do have it, it is not something that she HAS to have in order to actually be pregnant. My "morning sickness" which was actually very late at night sickness.....didn't start until the second month. So perhaps she is pregnant, only not far enough along yet to actually feel sick. Maybe the two of you should go to the doctor and get a blood test to find out for sure. Best of Luck to you both!!!
LHojBfx5aa	Well tell your mom that he is YOUR child, NOT hers. Tell her you want to raise him the right way and even though your son may be very disrespectful you can't get to angry with him because he will just get angry back. Teach him that he's very lucky to have what he has and that their are other people out there who don't get everything he gets.     He might feel guilty, teach him to put others first. Though he may not do it all the time, it could help. Limit Granny's time with your son, and tell her NOT to spoil him, because he is your son. Lay down the law, tell her if she doesn't stop then he won't be spending as much time with her.     Oh and when your son does something right, reward him. If he does something wrong, take away that privilege, and if he tries to argue just ignore him. Like, keep a point chart and if he gets however many points he'll get a prize but if he does something wrong you'll take away points. That usually keeps them motivated.    Good Luck Hun! I know it must be difficult for you.|`|dhTjfUvkaa	it seems like your beautiful child is just suffering the consequences of your situation.  I commend you for working full time and not depending on the welfare system to support your child.  HOWEVER your child is spending most of his time without a PARENT FIGURE, because your mother SHOULD be the acting parental figure when u are gone but she isn't.  This is really hard on your child, and I think a very delicate situation.  I don't know more details like how much time do you spend with him when you are at home? I would hope that you spend your weekends with him as much as possible! Have you thought that maybe he needs a male figure in his life? Maybe an uncle ?      Your mother needs to realize that its more harmful to the child to spoil him.  She can't be his friend, but has to be like his mother.    Be strong and pray.  everything will work out for you, you sound very strong already.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Seeing Grandma is a privilege, not a right. If she cannot obey your wishes, then she should not have the right to see him, either. You're the parent, not her. He won't be able to stand still, he is five. The workplace is somewhere a child shouldn't be at. Find a sitter for him when you're at work.|`|rnNGTYo9aa	i was in the same situation years ago with my mom while i was living with her !  me = with a baby girl, it was like this for 5 years, my mom spoiled my daughter so much !!!  anyways it's only going to end when you move out!,, no that i'm not living with her i like seeing my mom spoiling my daughter,...  ;)
Ybo6HS8Caa	I started my son in basketball at 5, in kindergarten.  He played a couple of years and decided he didn't want to anymore.  Now he's 8 and is in cub scouts.  My other kids are 5 and 6, and I'm pretty sure everyone is leaning towards soccer this year.|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Dancing is better than ballett or any sport that requires a lot of discipline. I believe those kind of sports should be chosen when your child is older and wishes to join such a sport. You don't wanna sign her up somewhere just because you think its a great idea but your daughter hates it. She has to love it.  I found that dancing is the best since they have age oriented groups ( a four year old for example can not follow instructions as well as a six year old nor will she have the same attentions span)  It age appropiate and its fun! What kid doesnt love to dance plus its good exercise.  And when she gets older she can start choosing what kind of dancing she wants to do ( very popular is hip hop dancing and its awesome exercise and it teaches them about discipline since thats required..lol)    Also any activity thats kids that age see as fun would be good, like soccer.   You know your kid best and know whats better suited for her. Like if she's shy perhaps team sport wouldnt be so good right now ( til she gets more comfortable) because it requires her to be open.   Dancing is more like a group, she with kids but she doesnt have to interact with them unless she feels comfortable, u know what i mean.  Also you said she doesnt listen, so maybe you wanna try not acting like its required of her but to make her see it as an opportunitty.Take her to class ( every sport offers a free course for you to see how u like it) and have her see for herself. See if she likes it.   Hope this helps you  PS any age after three is fine if your child is okay with it! Your child makes the call.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	my daughter starts ballet at 3, however, i suggest you take advantage of the trial class most ballet studio offer, that way you can see how she likes it or is she mature enough to listen to the instructions.  If she is totally running around not listening, i suggest you might want to wait a little bit.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	My daughter is just going on 4 and I'm about to put her in a dance class once a week (she loves dancing).  I think between 3 and 4 is a good age, but don't make it too strenuous for her.  At their age, I think once a week as a hobby and something to look forward to is enough, especially if they have already in daycare or pre-school.  You don't want to over commit your kids.  But most places have special classes for toddlers where it is designed around their needs and abilities.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	They started as soon as they were able to, my sons were in soccersince they were barely 3, and they played instruements at 4 and my daughters were in dance and whatever sport they wanted to be in. They also play piano, and the guitar. And were in gymnastics, and my oldest was tumbling by 6.     Whenever, they can...is a good time. Its better to start early.|`|oP504BtFaa	All of my daughters took a ballet/tap combo class at three, but only two stuck with it. Kindergarten started peewee soccer for Allison and Celia, but only Allison stuck with it (plays to this day!) We started pretty early - before elementary school (age 3) but throughout elementary school they will pick interests up in school and come home one day saying "Mommy I like to bake!" (Kids Baking Classes, here you come!)|`|O2fXBvB2aa	I started my daughter in ballet and tap at age 4.  She did listen but not all the time because at that age kids have a short attention span.  I also started her in soccer at 4 it's really cute and really easy for the kids since they just have to run and chase the ball around.  Softball I waited till 5.  Most sports start at 4 or 5.|`|AA10730513	My daughter first wanted to try soccer when she was 4. ... That didn't work out. She wasn't ready. She tried again at 6 and loved it! But honestly, with her being so young - we spent our Tuesday and Thursday evenings in a rush to finish homework, stuff some food in our tummies, get a bath, and go to bed.     We will probably try soccer again when she is 7 or 8 and able to stay up later.     This is really something that's up to you. But in general, I'd say that 5 or 6 is a good age if you can be home by 4pm. (That way your evenings wouldn't be as rushed and stressful as ours were!) Otherwise, wait until you are at a point where you can have 2 hours of free time in an evening for practice and stuff.|`|2uDlTBuUaa	I started my daughter in soccer at three and dance at four.  She loves socializing with other kids her age and just doing something that is just for her.  I would also take advantage of the trial classes studios offer for dance.  Some kids just are not into it, and you really don't want to waste the money if you don't have to.|`|AA11537580	4 or 5

bcZSIphUaa	I've got PCOS.    You can rule out PCOS if your ultrasound is normal. With PCOS your ultrasound would have shown multiple tiny cysts on your ovaries.    Also, a blood test for hormone levels would show hormone irregularities as associated with PCOS.    I don't know much about endometriosis or adenomyosis  - but I think that symptoms of these conditions may include pain during sex and bleeding? I"m really not sure.    But, I'm certain that  it's not PCOS.    I have PCOS so I know a lot about it.    It;s really hard waiting for results and diagnoses - I've been there and done that. At least when you have a name for what you have you feel sense of relief because you know where you stand.    I wish you all the very best. I bet there a SO many women finding out that they have problems after they stop taking the Pill - the pill really masks everything and gives us fake periods which make us think that all is ok.

This is why, I refuse to get pregnant until my husband changes his mind or meets me somewhere in the middle.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	1) LOVE YOUR NAME!! my youngest daughter is Morgan too!    2) I get upset when stay at home mom's complain that working mothers are bad parents, but I dont hate them. I can not sit around all day at home, I am the type of person who goes stir crazy and that would make for a very stressful household    3) I went back to work after 7 weeks with the first (because I had to financially) and after 12 weeks with the second (I took the max leave of absence).    4) I like to be financially independent and feel like my own person, if that makes any sense. My kids are in school now so they really do not miss me. Their college is already paid for (even though they are young), we own a nice house, and the kids have money for their extra activities they like.     5) Another thing that drives me nuts is the moms that think they have to stay at home even when their children are in school. Why? I dont get that at all. A woman on here yesterday thought that going back to work with a 7 year old kid was too soon. ????? HUH??? She is in school all day and most likely has other little friends she plays with after school now too. What is it that they contribute all day while the kids are in school? Not being mean here, but geez.     6) I know many moms are very happy staying home and the kids can also benefit too. I like to see happy families. Daycare or latchkey after school is not the end of the world. Kids there get playtime with their peers and learn great communication and socialization skills that are needed for development of self esteem. I do think that day care around the clock is ridiculous, but for an hour a day, I really dont see the harm in it.     hope this helps!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I am kind of going to be a stay at home mom.

I think I would get bored and have to find at least a part time job that I would only work while they were in school.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I think there's a general perception that staying home all day--with or without kids--is simple, or lazy even.     I'm a stay-at-home mom who also puts in a 40 hour work week from home. I believe anyone who is or really knows just how busy stay-at-home moms/homemakers are wouldn't envy the schedules they keep! I occasionally find myself missing the easy days at the office.    In fact, many at-home moms these days aren't just homemakers. They are employed, too.|`|eya1WDS4aa	I think its better if you can afford it to stay at home with your children. Im staying home with mine and once my kids are in school then i might get a job working while they are in school but i think its important exspecialy in this day and age to have a stay at home parent. My honest opinion i didnt have kids just to put them in day care and have some one else raise them.|`|nrQijvMuaa	Nothing wrong with a stay at home mom. Stay at home moms work just as hard as people working out in the field.|`|DApXuaJyaa	my husband works i stay at home, i have a full time job my kids!!! once they are at school full time i will get a part time job, im looking into doing 2 nights a week night work soon just so i can help out with money   childcare is too expensive now days so mums have to stay at home!! just we dont get payed money for it we get love instead, its not easy being a full time mum it bloody hard work!!!lol|`|BKr3y30maa	I think some people "hate" stay at home moms because they think that person is just being lazy.  Now don't get me wrong, i'm a stay at home mom.  My son is 3.  But when he is old enough to go to school, i'm definetly getting a job, whether it be part-time or full-time. I couldn't imagine being at home all day long by myself.  Let's be honest, those that are in that situation, you can't tell me you clean the house and do laundry ALL DAY LONG!   Not to mention, you can never have too much money in the household when you have children.  There are medical expenses and their college tuition to always think about.  I have some friends that i can honestly say are stay at home moms and will probably be forever JUST because they want to be lazy and stay at home.  Yet, they whine all the time about how they are bored!!!!  This is just my opinion.|`|0WstfAmzaa	If and when I have children, I am hoping to stay at home until the are all in school full-time (so age 6).  I would go back to work for two days a week if we needed it financially and a family member such as my mother was willing to look after the child (not for free, obviously).  But, once the child was in school I would go back to work, maybe not full-time, but a couple days a week during the hours they are in school.      If a couple has no need for the second income, then fine, a woman can stay at home as long as wants.  It doesn't bother me at all to see women who stay at home and are homemakers all their life.|`|0nIFyDk9aa	i have been a stay at home mom for ten years now and can not dream of going back to work. it gets a little boring at time but my little guy  keeps me going.when he thinks i have been sitting long enough he raises hell. there's a lot of parents have to work to Support there family and do well at it and some father have to be stay at home dads and let there wife's work.what ever works for family to make a good home for there children is the right why to go.with my husband and i it will cost more for a baby sitter and both of use work then for me to stay home.|`|8GvVWgFPaa	Honestly, I use to work as a full time Accountant and it was so stressful. I quit my job due to being completely taken advantage of for the past 2 years.  I actually couldn't have been more happier as a stay at home mom. I do believe it is an individuals decision to become a home maker. Some people have different points of view on why they despise stay at home moms, some believe it should be an independent thing. My husband actually LOVES that I stay home, because he was brought up old fashion(traditonal) that the man works and brings home the money and takes care of his family. I was brought up in a broken family where my mom was independent to an extent but also was dependent on wealthy men. So I grew up seeing an independent woman. I didn't like her gold digging side, but I understood her independent side. I respect that my husband wants me to stay home and since this is my first child, I'm testing the traditonal waters right now. He said if I wasn't happy with it, then he said he wasn't going to keep me at home. He works two jobs, which is very hard to find these days, but you can also stay home and work as well. There are legit websites to go to about REAL stay at home moms WORKING from home.  I hope this helps. I just believe if things don't work out for me, I can always send my accounting resume out and find a job and find daycare services. OH YAY!!! Daycare is costing an arm and a leg now these days and babysitters are ridiculously high too just because the economy and they see everyone else raising their prices, they raise theirs too. I hope this helps. I've babbled on long enough. (ps. to other readers, this is just my OPINION, so don't hand out thumbs down to me or others just because you don't agree with my point of view on this subject. Thank you)  =]
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	I have never liked that Name,sorry..|`|R0sfdiNeaa	not at all and so cute|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I think its beautiful!    Great Spelling too|`|mZi7R0Enaa	NO it is a sweet and feminine name and classic!|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	i like Holly better|`|qpt51YeAaa	i used to know a big fat girl named holly  and i think it ruined my outlook on the name  :[    i dunno, it reminds me of 'helga'  hahaha|`|9EdUCTwjaa	not at all. my friend's name is hollie, but spelt holly    some others you might like are:  Hailey/Haillie (hay-lee)  Hallie/Haley (hal-Ee)|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Not at all, I think that it is cute.|`|dKMpztcJaa	Love it    Just stick with the christmas thing and name her Hollie Noelle|`|ylgNuE3uaa	I LOVE it.|`|meHJ5uPcaa	its a pretty nice name|`|ljFBfguRaa	Like the name, better spelled Holly.|`|3vWpUXsmaa	My name is Holly and my middle name is Joy. I do like my name and it suits me, and now a days it's a pretty uncommon name. But I can tell you from a personal stand point that no matter how you spell it your daughter will get plenty of Christmas songs sung to her and she will be asked repeatedly if she was born on Christmas (I was born in June). It didn't and still doesn't bother me too much. It's a nice name. Good luck!|`|7SgVzX4daa	I love that name. It is my favorite girl name and I want to name my future daughter it. I don't think that it is too Christmas related.|`|Hky3sGeZaa	Nice name and not too christmas orientated.|`|4cpOI5cOaa	it a Pretty name|`|qc7zP89jaa	That's a beautiful Nameh..  :)   Nope,Its not too christmas orientated  -Tina |`|upAYuSH9aa	it is a little christmasy. its a pretty name though. just saying, most of the people i know with the name Holly or Hollie have birthdays very close to christmas. but who cares? just go for it!|`|gQpKeJ5laa	Christmas?  Hollie is fine.  Any name is fine, really.  What is in a name?  Some names have built in meaning - other names take on the meaning of the person who gave it - Hollie.  Also - does it fit? the person, the last name, the middle name.|`|D2l4sND2aa	I like it I guess, but spell it with a Y
Irdj2KAFaa	The only other thing I can think of is for you to increase the consistency of your follow-through: (example: consequences for his/her actions).     Your toddler will have a better understanding of how mercy and grace work within your capacity to deliver discipline. For example, if your consistency is weak, then mercy grows on trees as far as your toddler is concerned.      If there is another parent in this picture, then the both of you need to support each other in every way possible. If the other parent is weak in follow-through or consistency, then (again) mercy is as free as the air he/she breaths.    [Edit]  One more thing, (although we love them to pieces) Grandparents are the (IMO) chief cause for disciplinary regression.    Cheers & good luck.|`|AA10700407	just be consistent.  if you act the same way every time and don't let up on the discipline, eventually the child will listen.  it's hard for a 3 year old to listen, so be patient.  count to 3, then time out, try to avoid spankings.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	your toddler is always listening!  stop using the word NO, sit on the floor more often, stop talking & start listening, encourage positive behaviors & ignore the negative ones, and model the behavior you want the child to emulate.|`|bc5jGZ0uaa	wait a few years?    I don't know, my daughter is 2 so I'm wondering the same thing!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Well my son is 14 months old and has impeccable listening skills and is very well behaved. He just knows how to listen really well.   There are many, many examples I could use but too many to list.    We have always been very involved with our son. And have taught him the word no since he's been getting around ( 5 months old roughly ). We have never had to baby proof our home. There is glass every where. We put our plates and cups underneath the bar we have in the kitchen. There are many little nick nacks laying around. He knows better because we taught him better.    You should of started telling your child no a lot longer ago. Good luck.|`|d1csiCLKaa	Try ignoringg your child, turn your back on the child and depending on his/her age you could explain that you will come back/ talk to the child when they have calmed down etc but remember to come down to the child eye level, as you look like a huge monster standing over your child.    Don't give your child a negative reaction like shouting or raising your voice to what ever he/she has done but always remember that if he/she does something that is asked or does something like cleaning up toys etc without being asked to, make a massive fuss, i used to dance round the room lol.        This has worked wonders for my 3 year old daughter, yes she still has her bad days but hey don't we all lol    Good Luck!!|`|4FvmJEx9aa	screw a spanking. Get a belt and BEAT THAT AZZ!|`|HB38sMkfaa	get down on the childs level speak calmly clearly and say what you need to.thats what i do with my daughter shes almost 2.when she freaks i get down and talk to her calmly telling her she has to stop crying/being crazy/freaking out...and listen to me.you have to keep your composure if you want your child to do the same thing|`|caA35sD5aa	Whatever you choose to do you have to stick with it! Children try to test the boundaries as much as possible so if you threaten with a time out you have to follow through with it every time.. be consistent with them so they can understand. It may take a while but just be consistent with it and they will begin to listen.  Good Luck|`|PCsW0gbPaa	You have to be consistent.  Don't reward the behavior.  Keep that in mind because that is the main thing.  Most behavior problems start and continue because the parent reinforces it in some way.      Punishment does not have to be anything major, but if you do it, it has to be immediate and definite.  Choose your battles and just work on the important stuff or else you won't have any relationship with your child except as a disciplinarian.      Remember that toddlers just don't have the same mental capability that adults do and might not be able to do what you are asking.  Your child can not be perfect.  Just try to support and positively shape him/her as best as you can, providing structure and boundaries as well as love and affection.|`|1881f384f0ce54be24309e52cd72d1beaa	Consistency.  Ask your child to do something, tell your child to do something, then get off your butt and help them do it.  I see a lot of parents barking out threats but not following up, and the kids know they don't have to listen till Mom is chasing after them screaming.  Also offer the child choices, both of which you like the answer to.  "Would you like to clean up your toys now or after your snack?"  If they feel a part of the process and are treated respectfully, you'll have better results.|`|BAJd8raoaa	Your child is definitely listening to you.  In fact, he or she is hanging on your every word.  Try counting to TEN for yourself before you let anger shape his or her discipline.  If he or she is throwing fits, don't acknowledge them.  They will eventually learn that throwing fits doesn't accomplish anything.
J3TRJPIwaa	Your age is young but your maturity level may be higher. I was always more mature for my age and more mature than my friends. I also dealt with things in my past and my sister was a teenage mom so I learned from her mistakes early on. However, not laughing at those words doesn't give us a sense of whether you are mature or not.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I think with the bad stuff you went thru, i won't be surprise if you are more mature than your real age.  Sometimes if a person is mature or not doesn't reflected by their age, i saw some very inmature 20 years old, as well as some very responsible 15 years old.  All depends.|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	Comparing a 17 year old and a 12 year old is like comparing a newborn (can't move, walk) to a 1 year old (walk, run, talk, eat solids). There are huge developmental differences that occur during the middle and end of the teenage years. Most adults call it puberty.     Being raped at such a young age has clearly forced a level of maturity and reality on you that most parents would wish never happened. Thus, you are in the awkward position of being perceived as being "young and dumb," when in reality you are now wiser beyond your years.     From now until you're an adult, you are going to have to walk a tightrope as to how you want to be perceived.  Do you want everyone to think of you as a little kid 12 year old, or someone who has grown up faster than they should have. I can't answer that question for you. Adults have been arguing about this for years. Many groups, such as the National Organization of Woman believe that anyone who is raped shouldn't be hidden away from the public, and instead should be brought into the public. Others feel that a rape is so vile that it shouldn't be discussed.     Either way, your question indicates a need for further counseling. I recommend looking online for rape support groups. There are other girls in the same position out there that have gone through the same things you went through, some even worse.|`|UdV0yLJaaa	Some people consider 12 years to be little... it really just depends on the person, of course a 6-year old would consider you to be a big kid.    You can be considered mature, however. I know plenty of people who are very young yet one of the more intelligent of my friends, given their age... and mature about things, like your situation.
XkWTsyJdaa	Radko or Fedor. DO NOT choose darko it sounds too weird/funny or borris.    balance out the VERY unique names with more common middle names. like radko channing or radko braden. or fedor wesley or fedor scott|`|ylgNuE3uaa	Flavio...  sounds great.|`|BZzarKRSaa	um if i had any one those names i would be imbaressed but i would pick darko|`|QAN5OxWIaa	stoyan or fedor|`|gJlxZdL5aa	What about Marko or Luka  (I love those two names both are Serbian names)    Out of that list I like Fedor|`|qXpxILnRaa	Boris|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I wouldn't go with Darko (b/c of the movie, just me)    Boris sounds old and Yakov is my least favorite.    Radko isn't bad, kids would probably call him Rad.    Stoyan and Fedor are good. Flavio is okay.    Good luck helping your friend!|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Flavio|`|zXcaTKqRaa	I think Darko is a really cool name. Tell her to go for it!  Some suggestions--  (these are Slavic):  Bo.  Niko.  Vladimir.  Dmitri.  (these are Russian):  Nikolai -- nick-uh-lie.  Yuri.  Alexei.  Ivan.  Sergei.    I think Darko Ivan or Darko Vladimir sounds way cool.  Good luck.(:|`|YU1C3FUhaa	My favourites out of them are Stoyan and Radko!|`|QrlfIZ5Iaa	Fedor is my favorite.  :]|`|4ME3vNTbaa	She can't go wrong with Boris or Stoyan. But my  1 vote is for Boris  Tell her congrats on the new addition to her family!|`|Jw5YnRFyaa	i like darko and boris|`|lTwH0lZGaa	Yakov|`|lbABfa2taa	i would name him bob.  or Flavio either one is cool.|`|1vJpyCSRaa	None i wood say vladimir|`|qc7zP89jaa	1.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Your prior history of stroke may make you a high risk for further stroke and should be discussed thoroughly with your OB/GYN.  Granted, you had a hemmorhagic stroke, and most women I've seen with stroke after delivery (happens more often than you think) had an embolitic stroke, but either way, I would seriously discuss your specific risk factors for having another stroke during delievery.|`|93c02e5b1d7a30f862c52f37ff112c4aaa	yes go for it but make sure to talk with your doctor so he can definitely tell you that your body can take this....good luck|`|MtjhmD8faa	I saw a paraplegic woman give birth on the Discovery or TLC Channel...She got pregnant with the turkey baster method she said. She did get very skinny and had other problems. Baby was not born full term but they both lived through it. Talk to your Doctor before trying to conceive.   They used natural contractions to bring the baby down & suction to get the baby out. Baby had a cone head but was fine.|`|2kAtqPhwaa	As answered by people here - yes it is possible.  But you gotta watch out for your over all health.  Hope this helps:  http://naabhi-shodha.blogspot.com/|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would speak with the doctors but Yes I have seen a women that was paralyzed from the wast down have a baby|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes, but ask your doctor first. i saw a documentary on a woman who did this. check out her story. it was very inspiring.    http://www.thescizone.com/news/articles/...|`|myEwHgI1aa	Yes. I have read about this. Your body will know what to do when in labor, and you are capable of pushing out a baby. My suggestion is to speak to an OB or midwife about this, especially if you are pregnant  or trying for pregnancy.|`|yCR6qg0baa	It's possible to get pregnant. In some cases, it's possible to have a vaginal delivery. It's typically done via c-section though since a paralyzed woman can't feel what's going on & can't push.    You are not paralyzed if you can walk (even with a limp). Yes, you should be able to give birth.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Yes You can I have seen many women who have had babies but I would go to the Doc just to make sure. Best of Luck to you!
bcZSIphUaa	Have they checked your partners sperm?    There is 50% chance that the infertility is male related.    Make sure you do this ASAP!|`|cl6r8cGBaa	i know it must be really frustrating to wait.. but you just have to wait---patience is a virtue..why don't you try it on your ovulation day?|`|2kAtqPhwaa	The fact that you already have a girl is very reasssuring and rules out any issues with your husband.   Have you tried alternate methods like Yoga and meditation - coz most of the time it is the mind.  Read on:   http://naabhi-shodha.blogspot.com/2009/0...  Hope that helps.  You may IM or email me if you have specific questions.|`|q5MGxuyaaa	I have also been trying for a year now.  It is so frustrating and sad, especially when the first time getting pregnant was so easy!!  If you are having sex every other day around your fertile period than I would suggest having your partner tested.  You might also try instead cups after having sex, since they hold the sperm up there longer.  Goodluck!!

You could see if the salvation army needs volunteers or the police station.  You could also go to your school counciler to find out if there are any local projects that need volunteers.|`|SC91Uwrhaa	Try an old folks home!
WbJPQM1naa	It is possible for them be either, but identical sets of multiples are very rare.  It is much more likely that they are fraternal and either were conceived naturally or by IVF.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	http://www.mathiasquads.org/    The Mathias quads are identical.    Most are fraternal.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	They can be either. One egg splits into four--identical; two eggs split into four--both identical and fraternal (identical to their egg-mate, but fraternal to the two produced by the other egg). And then there's probably some weird statistic about a woman being able to release four separate eggs, causing them all to be fraternal.  :)|`|0xGm3lrxaa	It's very,very,very rare for them to be identical. Most of the time they are fraternal.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	There is a show on Discovery Health about a set of identical quadruplets (don't recall the name of it at this second) so I guess it is possible.

2xS1Jro7aa	Does his mother agree with you? Does he live with his mother? The only way you can change it is if you take him to court and get full custody of her. And that will be really hard to do if he is paying child support and is not abusing her and so on. It really sucks though! He should not be doing that the only person he is going to hurt is the child :(. Maybe go about it like its not big deal act like you want him to take her that way if he is doing it just to get to you then he should do the opposite when you act like you want him to take her. Call him up and say hey do you want her this weekend because I want to go out and so on. Use reverse psychology on him. Good luck!|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Wow. So you don't wanna punish his mom but you are perfectly fine with punishing your daughter?!  Its his child too, and he is her father, sorry if you don't like that but hey it was fine when you had sex right.  You don't have to like him but you have to be responsible. For your child's sake.|`|flqAr30laa	unless you have proof he is an unfit father, you can't just take away his rights. He can fight you to see his child.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Exactly why teenagers shouldn't have sex... ugh. The child is his just as much as she is yours. Just because he doesn't love you does not mean he does not love her. I'm assuming you still want a free babysitter (his mom) but you don't even want her dad to see her? Life doesn't work that way. Unless there is a court order, he can see his child whenever he wants. It's not up to you.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	You should really file for support. Child support has nothing to do with visitation. They are two completely separate issues before the court.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Child support has nothing to do with visitation.    Your denying your daughter her father, and it's not right. This is a human being NOT A TOOL TO FIGHT WITH.    You haven't given one good reason why he can't see her. He takes her to see her...that's a good reason.     My daughters father tried to kill us and was a drunk abusive a**hole who couldn't be bothered to come around, and when he did, it was with a different bar slut, and they both were high or drunk.   That is a reason for a father not to be allowed in a child's life.     You don't want his money? Your daughter will. If you have bills to pay you will. Even if you don't need it, put it in an account for her.     So, let his mom see her, talk to her.   You have to be civil to her father, for her sake.   You have to look at how he is with her, not at stuff that has no impact on your daughter. Start thinking of her well being, so he's got a big mouth? Does that make a differance when it comes time to change a diaper?|`|AA10624857	Your little girl deserves to have both of her parents in her life even if the two of you aren't in each others lives anymore. He will always be her father just like you will always be her mom. Unless he has done something Even if you haven't file for child support from him, at some point in time he may be required to pay it anyway if you ever need to apply for any financial help from a government agency. It is hard work to be a parent even when you are an adult in a loving, committed marriage with financial stability. When you are a single, teen mom relying on help from family, friends, and possibly government assistance, the task of raising a child can be overwhelming. Even if you no longer like the boy who is now forever connected to you by the fact he is your daughter's father, you still need to be respectful for your daughter's sake. If he is willing to take his daughter some of the time he should be allowed to do so unless there are legitimate concerns such as drug or alcohol abuse or she is in danger of being abused or neglected. For your daughter's sake, you are going to have to put aside your anger at him and do what is best for her. When it comes to court appointed child support it does not automatically translate into a specific visitation rights, but it could if he files for them. Just as a helpful hint from a long time Yahoo!Answers user, you'll want to keep in mind that when you post questions on this type of forum, you are opening it up to many people with all types of opinions and ideas. Your best course of action is to use what you can from the good answers and ignore the ones you don't like. Posting a rant is just going to get the question deleted as it isn't appropriate or keeping with the guidelines of use.|`|AFwMkAGlaa	You are a prime example of why people should be properly educated and mature before having kids.    You type like a 5 year old and both you and your "baby daddy" need to grow up.|`|kbIkVS0raa	child support and visitation have nothing to do with one another and you do not get to decide if the father gets to see his own child. He is the father and if you didn't want to deal with this you should not have been having sex in the first place. If he is not harming the baby then no judge is going to deny him time with his daughter|`|6SNhg2iwaa	him taking her just to take her is much better than the dads that want nothing to do with their children      just deal with it and leave it be for now. the point is that he wants to see her not why he wants to see her   as long as she is safe and you trust him as a father just let it be    EDIT: as the people above me have said   visitation is determined by the court not by the parents unless it is agreed upon in legal papers turned into the courts  and at your age that would also involve the Child Services who will get involved and decide what is best for your daughter    just deal with it unless you want to see a judge deal with the issue
bcZSIphUaa	I'm guessing that they check hormone levels - your hormones (LH, FSH etc) change when you're ovulating - so they are testing you hormone levels to see whether you're ovulating.    Do you have PCOS?    If so are you on Metformin too? Met can really help : )    I'm on MEt and starting Clomid in few months.

On the 3rd February I started to bleed with the flow of a normal period but now Ive had literally a spot of blood all day.    I expected that I missed the period on the 11th due to stress but I was expecting my next one to arrive by the 15th February, so either this period (if thats what it is) has arrived early or very late.    Me and my partner have had unprotected sex about 7 times whilst my period was missing/uptil the bleeding.    I had a blood test for HCG on the 17th Jan and was negative and all urine tests negative last week.    I dont understand whats going on, do you?    am i pregnant, do i have mixed up hormones? I am not under any stress or on any b/c pills    I have had a history of low HCG with my last pregnancy but I honestly do not feel pregnant.|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	It could be that you are preganant. I've heard that you always spot once before being pregnant, but I must agree with everyone else, TAKE A TEST!!!! That will be the only way to find out and trust me you will finally feel peace... that happened to me.
MOsStEbqaa	I think the best thing for you to do is go get a blood test. This sounds like you could be. You could also just take another urine test it would higher by now if you were pregnant.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Sounds like a blood test is in order..maybe implantation bleeding..GOOD LUCK my thoughts are with you!
SzNmGV0Daa	Sounds like you might have a hormone imbalance. HCG is only present when you are pregnant. Have your doctor run a blood test to check your progesterone, sounds like that might be your problem. If you did get the pregnancy test at the office and it was negative than it is correct. Goodluck!|`|q5MGxuyaaa	It sounds like you are not ovulating, therefore, are not getting regular or normal periods, and that is why your flow and days aren't consistent.  Usually they can determine this through bloodwork, or you can determine this by charting your temps.  Check out www.fertilityfriend.com if you are interested, as it teaches you how to chart for free!  Goodluck!!
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	I think your parents may have legal recourse. She is abusing the system. It's not unlike making a phony police report or dialing 911 just to harrass someone. I think the dfacs has to respond at this point, although they will give your sister less and less credibility each time. If it is bothering them, they could go down to the police station and find out if they can file a report about it.     Keep in mind that at a federal courthouse, they cannot turn crazy people away who want to file lawsuits against public figures (like against the president, the CIA, often for things like alleged anal probes, spying, you know, really crazy paranoid stuff.) Obviously nothing comes of it, and the more your sister raises a false alarm, the less credibility she'll have.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think they should get a good lawyer. And probably, after awhile CPS might stop taking her seriously because so far, her allegations haven't amounted to anything. They might realize her position as the disgruntled mother and decide to tell her to stop or perhaps your parents, if they're willing, could get a restraining order against her.

bcZSIphUaa	I have PCOS too.    I'm sorry that clomid didn't work for you.    Are you on Metformin?    Please have a read through the links that I've included below. Metformin is having really positive effects on PCOS women - my apologies if you are already on MEt or know about it!    I've just started on Metformin - then I'll be trying Clomid in a few months.    May I also remind you not to forget about the NATURAL ways to increase your fertility.    Most PCOS women are overweight (I'm actually thin so I'm an exception). Losing weight and eating a really healthy diet does wonders for fertility! Make sure that you're looking after yourself and exercising and eating well!    Best of luck with your next treatment (injectibles).|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Have you had your day 21 progesterone levels checked to see if you are ovulating on the clomid?  Have you had an HSG to make sure your tubes aren't blocked?  Has your partner had his sperm checked?    It depends on your doctor but you will probably move onto some sort of injectable.  I did 6 rounds of clomid (ovulated 5 of the 6 cycles) and did not get pregnant.  Next my doctor put me on a combination of clomid and a low dose of an injectable called Repronex and I got pregnant my first cycle.    In general injectables are much more involved than clomid.  They are associated with far more side effects than clomid (multiples being 1 of the possible side effects) and therefore patients should be closely monitored by their doctors while taking injectables.  My doctor required that I take a class with the nurse to learn about the protocol, possible side effects as well as being trained on how to administer the injections.|`|tvBirM5Taa	There are different protocols that health care providers follow.  For me, my provider had me try 3 rounds of clomid.  If that didn't work, an HSG would follow.  If all is clear from the HSG, they would've followed up with IVF.     The HSG has been shown to help clear out tubes and some women get pregnant right away.  Fortunately, that happened to me and we didn't have to go through IVF!|`|SzNmGV0Daa	The next step would be clomid with IUI, or IVF. I would be weary of going somewhere for a shot?!? Research before you allow someone to inject you with medicine that you don't know the side affects. Just be careful! Goodluck sweetie and God bless.

Fkl6gV8Qaa	Many exclusively breastfed babies WON'T take formula when the time comes (have you tried the stuff).

When I was breastfeeding my son we would use nestle smart start when we needed to supplement.  That was his preference, I think it tasted a bit more like breast milk than the others.

T6nmD3X9aa	well, you can not change what has already happened so in the best interest of 'keeping the peace' you should probably not mention all the stuff you do not like about her, about how they met, and about the visit.   Tell your son that you want her parents to get in contact with you, maybe set up a meeting over the weekend where you can all discuss this. Really, your son is an adult now and responsible for his own actions. It is up to him to figure this out, hopefully with your help.   As much as this is not the ideal situation, it happened. I don't think that requesting a blood test is unrealistic (it may hurt the girls feelings, and her parents), but that is also something that can be brought up later on. Tell her you want to make sure she is taking vitamins, see her doctor, and being responsible. Let both kids know you are there for support if they need it. This will go along way with future requests and advice. Try to get along with everyone. Ask your son what his intentions are (with the girl, the baby, where he lives, his future, etc.) and try to be reasonable about things.     I wish you all good luck.|`|jNwkgcTCaa	Accept it.  What's done is done.  Tell them if they need help, "I'll always be there if you need my help."  And all you can do is hope for the best.  Good luck!|`|0xiHNsmVaa	Why the hell did they let her stay over in the first place?|`|4ThRaoBOaa	That is terrible! talking to her mom would be the best alternative.

jNwkgcTCaa	Have a house party? Though that'd be pretty messy after.  How about all of you go to the movies?  Or go to an amusement park.  It'd be so fun.  :]
ZbTeOwuTaa	In the short term, I would recommend just taking the hair away and telling him/her "No" or "Icky" or whatever "Stop Eating This" word you happen to use.    As a possible preventative measure, I would also try to  find out where he/she GOT the hair.  If it was from a pet shedding, maybe learn you have to be extra diligent about vacuuming those up.  If it was from a hair brush, maybe you should be placing those higher up where he/she can't reach them.    If it turns out he or she is pulling out the hair from a pet or sibling, it may be acting out for attention or a sign of jealousy that needs to be resolved.  If your child is pulling the hair out of his/her own body, this may be curiousity or acting out, but it is also a sign of a psychological disorder called Trichotillomania and/or a sign of OCD, so it would be a very good idea to mention it to your doctor and just keep your eyes open for warning signs.  I included a link in sources on this disorder so you can look it up for yourself.    That having been said, toddlers are curious and sometimes aggressive and I only mention those disorders to keep you, the parent, informed just in case.  It's not likely, and even if it ends up being the reason, it is VERY treatable with behavior therapy ESPECIALLY at such a young age.  Don't panic (I know, easy for me to say) until you've actually spoken to a doctor about it.|`|CpCBxiIOaa	tell her/ him NOO! then tie her/hair back!|`|hHQIUrNjaa	umm replace it with something thats edible|`|Ew2wC9piaa	take it from him that's nasty. and if it was his hair i would have it cut cause little boys do not need to have long hair. i did it a few times when i was little and i got in trouble every time so i stopped real quick|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Whose hair?

If they are older than two but less than four, then they just probably don't realize it's wrong. Any older than four and your kid has a psychosis called Trichophagia ("hair" and "to eat" in latin).    In any case, you should take them to a doctor because the eating of the hair may cause a hard clump of hair to plug up their bowels, which could result in the death of your child...
SzNmGV0Daa	You have an hour from ejaculation to insem, but he would need to bring the sample to the doctor for the sperm count, motility, and morphology to know anything about the donor sperm. The donor should also sustain from intercourse for three days prior to donation. Do you plan on doing this yourself? Do you have a physician? If not I would suggest finding one. Goodluck.|`|sk46uigvaa	"The quantity is good, the best way to say this is it resembles mucus".............."Its thick so does that mean its safe to guess its okay? "      how old are you??!?!?!?!?!??!?!      sorry but you need to go to a doctors lab to get the sperm count and motility and morphology done before you can say whether it's good enough to make a healthy baby.    Do you know this guys sexual history, has he been STD tested?  has he a history of drug usage or high alcohol consumption?    here are some examples of sperm samples http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iu1gSNvI... (observe the double tailed sperm, funny abnormal sperm etc)    this link will give you a better idea of male fertility http://fertilinet.com/male.htm (see pictures)  If the guy who is giving you a sperm sample takes drugs, drink etc then you may either have difficulty getting pregnant or you may fall pregnant and miscarry due to abnormal embryo development.      Also how are you testing for ovulation????      you need to inject the sperm sample within 10 minutes.      I think you need to do more research|`|77a6f94018eaab3cf1e42502c3817012aa	uh...yeah, I don't think the look and consistency can determine the quality of sperm.  The sperm needs to be in a lab for "counting."|`|0XCSQsf3aa	You should inseminate within 10 minutes, and keep it warm meanwhile.
d781eClkaa	Yes. You can be charged with assault, battery, attempted murder, having a concealed weapon, and a whole multitude of other bad things. It doesn't matter how old you are, the law is still the law.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Duh.      And it is "illegal".|`|5NKwUZpVaa	Normally, yes but it sort of depends. If the kid is using a weapon of some kind they can't be charged with assault, attempted murder, having a concealed weapon, etc. But if is just a small fist fight, they will probably be suspended, or expelled.
yZWhgvgHaa	well it shows bone... so i would think so    But they arent supposed to do any type of x rays when your pregnant because it can harm your baby.... so if youre pregnant tell your doc. before he/she performs one on you.        EDIT  *******  Well... then my answer would be yes... if the baby is big enough to be seen on an ultrasound i would think that the bone matter? would be able to be seen through an x-ray. It makes sense anyways lol.|`|pKr77Vqiaa	your not supposed to have x-rays when you are pregnant, what so ever no matter what!|`|780ByZVEaa	they don't do x'rays when your pregnant|`|6yy0jtzDaa	yes because it is bone it visible on ultrasounds but not later until pregnancy|`|uHPNOMvzaa	well your not suppose to be getting and x-ray because the radiation will harm or kill the baby but no because their bones aren't completely developed.
AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.    There is sperm in pre-ejaculation, therefore the pull out method does not work, I can attest to this, as I have 2 kids from this form of "birth control."    Stop stressing out, stress can delay a period.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Most women get pregnant two weeks before the start of their period.  Id say there is a very high chance.  Take a test.|`|NFt3h7dHaa	I was with my guy ONE time for ONE minute (and he wasn't even close to needing to) and we got pregnant--just to let you know people really aren't kidding about that.    You could have gotten pregnant from either experience--keep your eyes peeled for other symptoms (which unfortunately are also a LOT like PMS) like cramps, breast tenderness, headaches, etc.    The odds seem low as any number of things could be making you tired, nauseated and even late on your period, but a test wouldn't hurt.    Good luck.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Yes, depending on when you ovulate. If you have a 28 day cycle to can get pregnant 2 weeks before your cycle, if you are irregular it's a good chance since you can't really tell when you ovulate.|`|N48qV69daa	Its possible to get pregnant at any given time. If you didnt know this, why are you having sex?|`|0wZcKn8Zaa	congrats on your new baby
AA11763588	No, this is not a symptom of pregnancy.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	no it would have nothing to do with pregnancy.|`|zSABr7praa	You'd be 4 weeks pregnant.  At two weeks, you haven't even missed your period.  Go to babycenter.com and look up due date calculator, it'll tell you how far along you are, accurately, based on your last period.|`|gyoylefvaa	yes, you can ger hungry and eat a lot for a couple weeks.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	if it does, then i might finally be lucky!!!!|`|9Y9K7qDTaa	Uhm, at 2 weeks how the hell would you even know you're pregnant?  You don't usually know until like almost 4 weeks at the earliest ..  I think it's all in your head & your stomach is making that noise because it's telling you you're hungry & even if you were pregnant, that has nothing to do with pregnancy.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Not alot, but your taste will start changing.|`|HoJ1pLtraa	I guess i'm always hungry all the time I could be almost 4 weeks|`|6yy0jtzDaa	2 weeks? it too early to tell|`|bZBByJAAaa	I wasn't hungry at all at that stage. I lost weight because I didn't feel like eating. I could only stand salads, watery soups and stuff that wasn't too heavy.|`|NLjAPHx0aa	I didn't  get hungry at 2 weeks. I'm 16 weeks now and i still don't get hungry. Just same as always.|`|jiFXPCyUaa	your body does a lot of things in early pregnancy. some how i found out that i'm pregnant really early. found out on the 20th of january. i am only a few weeks along, and a "hormonal mess" as my husband puts it.
D2l4sND2aa	I really like Genevieve Lyra, but don't nickname her Jenny!  and I don't like Francesca or Matilda. Maybe Ivy and Genevieve, those sound pretty together.|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	Genevieve Lyra and Francesca Ivy    I chose this combo because i am not too fond of the nickname Tillie for Matilda, or I would have chosen that combo. I think a beautiful combo would be Genevieve Lyra *Jenny* and Matilda Blythe *Mattie, or something else*|`|ZsKGRuZvaa	none they are ugly|`|CSzDV3gEaa	i like genevieve lyra and francesca heidi.|`|EvgSMTjnaa	Jenny and Chessie would be so cute!|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Genevieve Lyra & Heidi Francesca  ?  It flows best!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Genevieve Lydia & Matilda Blythe|`|R2OMEjrhaa	Genevieve Lydia & Matilda Blythe  "Jenny & Tillie"    those are very beautiful names|`|0xGm3lrxaa	Genevieve Lydia and Matilda Blythe|`|7qAlZRHmaa	Those are not well i wouldnt want them to be my name and go to school but that is my oppinion if i was to though Heidi and Haylo or Heidi and Jenny   good luck|`|5vtVsqx6aa	Okay, I love Genevieve Lyra and Matilda Blythe the best.    A nickname for Genevieve could also be Evie, Eve, Genna/Jenna    Good luck|`|n1mwxljzaa	Genevieve Lyra & Francesca Heidi  Jenny & Chessie|`|P9k8qHP6aa	Genevieve Lyra and Francesca Ivy|`|d6e11chxaa	Oooh, they're both awesome! I tend to root for Francesca Ivy and Matilda Blythe, but if I have to pick one or the other, I guess Genevieve Lydia and Matilda Blythe, but just barely.|`|2aI0UmhWaa	GGGGGGUnit|`|HZjiNEMDaa	They are all old fashioned|`|mN0DnlYYaa	Jenny and Tillie is nice.|`|eiRQp7zmaa	Genevieve Lydia and Francesca Heidi  Jenny is overused, What about Ginny? And just call her Francesca. Frankieis cruel, though chessie is cute. I love the name Genevieve, it is beautiful and underused. Same with Francesca. Matilda is kind of old sounding, and is getting REALLY popular suddenly. She wouldn't be the only one in her class.I say use Lydia for Genevieve's middle name. It flows better.|`|EP0cAEo7aa	Probably Jenny and Tillie
soFpywFcaa	i think its just an early sign of your period hope you get what you want good luck|`|zsBViFcSaa	Maybe you should take a pregnancy test first...try clearblue, and to be sure, get another pregnancy test from a different brand. Spotting usually happens when you're pregnant, but you can't be too sure. If you're still unsure about the pregnancy tests, go to a doctor!     I hope I helped and good luck, girl! =)|`|S009L679aa	well i think you might be pregnant! you should take a pregnancy test at home! wish you the best!|`|2f4de3c4028381592f2c0f6fd84aff06aa	Just wait and see...    If you can't wait, then go to the nearest Dollar Store and believe it or not, they actually have pregnancy Pee Sticks for only a dollar!  With my third baby I went there and saved about 15 bucks!    I hope you get the result you want!|`|HZubplhvaa	Hm, I'm going through that right now.  I had sex about 2 months ago...so I'm sure I'm okay.  Just, a light period.    Rare for me, but yeah.|`|AA11763588	If you are due then you can take a test to help ease your mind, or wait a few days and see if it comes.    Don't stress, stress can delay your period.|`|8d87fe8a8d0a0fb67336e3e06085d424aa	pregnancy test to be sure.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	just spotting could mean that you are pregnant but i would give it a few more days to see if you start if you dont start by saturday i would go ahead and take a test|`|9Y9K7qDTaa	By spotting do you mean no actual blood?  If it's actual blood then it's most likely your period, might just be a little messed up due to well .. anything, even stress or worry or anything like that.  Spotting when you're pregnant is called implantation & it's brown/light pink discharge .. no actual blood. It usually occurs about a week before your period.  If it sounds like what I just described you may be pregnant.  If you don't get an actual period with a steady flow then definitely test, :]  Best of luck sweetie.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	Just early signs of a period unless you had unprotected sex 2 weeks ago.|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	Are you on birth control?|`|HoJ1pLtraa	unless you had unprotected sex that's the onli way you could be pregnant|`|irGE84Qdaa	hun u have to wait and see if ur spotting turns into bleeding then periods and implantation bleeding is v light spotting and last for a day only well it was for me but it could last up to 3 days just lite spotting no bleeding.|`|8RmNOuRwaa	your pregnant|`|5JbARGHraa	You might be pregnant or having abnormal menstrual cycles.|`|84b26tbzaa	i think you should wait a week or two and buy a pregnancy test or make an appointment at you clinic for a blood pregnancy test
fKwFCptJaa	that's what happens to me.. dont worry.probably it was too early? but a question to you.. do you want to get pregnant?? i have tried sex a week before ovulating and a day before ovulating. and and my ovulation thingy is on the 4th. and still i have no answer. but be patient. if u think its to early then i think u should wait a lil longer. dont think u cant have children. i used to think like that too. but after a little bit of research i found out that some women take like about three years or sometimes less than a year to get pregnant. dont worry! just be patient! u cant get pregnant every time you have sex.. me and my boyfriend have been trying for 4 months already and still nothing..sometimes it takes longer.sometimes not that long! :)    -hope i helped a little|`|AA11763588	You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you start your period.    It is best to wait and see if your period comes and take a test, or wait 5 days after your period was due to let hormones build up on your system.    Or just see your DR and get blood work.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	you took it too early you need to wait till you miss your period so you have a few days but dont stress out you will find out soon enough and if you cant wait you can see your doctor and get a blood test|`|gyoylefvaa	you're pregnant. good luck.
CxCigxZIaa	Have your husband contact this dentist. Really. There is NO way a dentist is going to condone this. Ever.|`|AA10943329	No a dentist would not. It obviously makes the mother happy. Very bad parenting. I love Dummies (as they are called in Australia) but for babies, not 8 year olds|`|K5TrkUhCaa	No, I find it hard to believe that a dentist would say that it's okay for an 8 year old to be using one. That seems strange.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	NO, there is no way he would say that. My daughter is 21 months old, and her dentist said that she needed to be broke as soon as possible.|`|0ayP21R9aa	I definitely find it hard 2 belive that the dentist would say it is fine....the child will ithout a doubt need major braces and may become 2 attached 2 tht thing and may never get off of it|`|OMyC0IJVaa	Is she special needs? And by soother do you mean a pacifier?|`|5NKwUZpVaa	I cannot believe the dentist said that. It definitely isn't okay for her to still be on a soother. Try getting her a better comfort item that doesn't involve using her mouth.|`|StJIt5dCaa	I dont think that a dentist would really say this. I think maybe you should take her to a dentist yourself.
1ezYfkX7aa	Everyone has diff cravings.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	chalk, paint and dirt would be a no no|`|K2jT1z5jaa	anything is not classified as non eatable or any foods that are a no no during pregnancy.    make sure to eat your cravings - makes you feel so much better  God Bless x Take care !|`|pKr77Vqiaa	okay, craves mean something you want really bad, there isnt any answer to your ? diffrent people diffrent cravings.|`|T48smu01aa	mmm we can't tell you what to crave or not to crave.....but if you crave weird things like chalk, paint chips ect you need to see a doc asap!|`|5urfAbazaa	Theres no definite answers for this, you can crave anything. Just that some things you can eat and some that you can't.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	anything and everything|`|jNqf8HtDaa	its whatever your body needs thats what you crave and sometimes you have what you need so you dont really crave anything|`|LABC73E7aa	ummm u shouldnt care about your cravings you should care about the fact your freaking 13 and pregnant. too young. oo and everyone craves something different.|`|irGE84Qdaa	why do u have to mention that u r 13 to get pplz attention if this question only abt ur craving?|`|uhF1kHSTaa	you will probably crave everything but remember do not eat things that are not edible|`|gyoylefvaa	Well!, craves mean something you want really bad, there isnt any answer to your ? diffrent people diffrent cravings.|`|dqjkfbiQaa	Yes i do. School and an education|`|OSSRoUs2aa	Why must you mention that you are 13?  You should not announce that to the world because I'm not trying to be rude or harsh but it kinda can make you look like a ****. I'm sure you don't want to be looked at like that  But to answer your question when my mom was pregnant with me she craved pickles and ice cream.  Hope that helps.
AA11763588	You would not get heartburn right now, that happens later on.    Cramps can be from your period coming, or pregnancy.    Without dates and what not I can't really help you out.    There is sperm in pre-ejaculation.    Anytime you have unprotected sex you are at risk to get pregnant.    Go to Planned Parenthood for a test, if they say you are not then I'd suggest talking to them about birth control.|`|gyoylefvaa	No, you're not.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	You can get pregnant from pre-semen, but more than likely you are not pregnant.|`|NLjAPHx0aa	could be, but not likely.|`|84b26tbzaa	take a pregentcy test , did you miss your period? if not you shouldnt worry|`|TGlWnFjxaa	I seriously doubt your pregnant.  Hearburn is a much later symptom in pregnancy.  Give it about a week. Dont panic cause if you do the stress can extend your period from comming... I think you'll get it in a week or less
Cg4fWi3Baa	I hate that it's so damn difficult to leave the house.     The part of the day I dread the most is around dinner time because I am the one who has to bath the childen who by this time are usually tired and grumpy, and cook dinner. My 4yr old gets very argumentative at this time of day which doesn't help.     The thing that annoys me most about being a stay at home mum is the fact that many people seem to assume that because I am home with the kids that I must have all this free time. That I must be lazy and it frustrates me when my husbands friends waltz in and ask stupid questions that make me feel belittled like 'when are you going to get a job'  EXCUSE ME!!!|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Amen! If the economy were better I would probably start looking for a part time job now because I am very close to pulling out all my hair.   Answering the questions.    1)I HATE folding laundry. I don't mind doing it, i don't even mind going up and down the basement stairs to do the laundry it's the folding that absolutely drives me CRAZY.    2) I think the most annoying part is people thinking that just because I'm home all the time that I have time to do all or their ods and ends. I mean I don't mind running an errand for a close friend or watching someones kids for a little while here and there but constantly doing things for others and watching their kids for free is annoying. The worst is that they ask you to do all the stuff that they don't have time for but then they act like you are less then them because you don't have an out of home career.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	The hardest part of my day is getting everyone up and around in the morning.  There are 5 of us in this house, with one bathroom.      The thing I hate doing most is mopping the kitchen floor.  I do not know why, but ever since I can remember I have hated doing it.    What annoys me the most?  People who assume that because I am home all day, I must be able to do their extra errands for them because I "obviously" have tons of time on my hands.  And people who assume that I don't work because I am lazy.  Quite the contrary, actually.      However, I am going back to work on 2/19.  I have been a SAHM for about a year now, and to be honest, it really just doens't suit my perosnality.  I went from working as a Dealer Rep for GMAC, wearing suits to work every day, having my morning meetings, etc to staying at home with my kids.  Talk about culture shock!  So, I am off to the office soon, not the same one, but an office anyway.  I can't wait!|`|RPszYGXkaa	You aren't alone.  We all love the fact that we can be home with our children, but it can also be taxing (but I wouldn't trade it for anything).  My hubby also works a lot too, so it is really all me... all day!    I thing I hate the most about my day is doing dishes.  We bought an older home with custom cabinetry, so one can't even be installed unless we get new cabinets (sigh).  I also hate cooking meals!  I can cook well, but never enjoyed it...now I have to prepare 3 squares (plus snacks) every day...before baby was born, if I was hungry I ate cereal!    What annoys me most about being a SAHM....aside from the isolation from adult conversation for a good part of the day, it is the fact that my daughter is so "used" to the way I do things (bedtime routines, baths, etc...) that hubby often doesn't do it the same way I do, and it doesn't work, so I have to re-do it anyway.    Thanks for the opportunity to vent!!    best wishes!|`|cqgWkdPtaa	1. I hate doing the washing up, i can't stand it, i can't explain why but argh!!  ( i want a dishwasher :( lol)    2. The most annoying thing about being a SAHM is when its assumed that i don't do anything!!!!!! Just because the house isn't spotless doesn't mean i sat on my **** all day!    Karolines mommy - that sounds EXACTLY like my life!!!   It sounds like EVERYONE needed to vent lol GOOD QUESTION!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Lol, I just told my husband last night at 1am that I am going on vacation to get a good night of sleep. I haven't slept more than 6hrs solid in a year and that has only been a few times. Most of the time I am up every 2hrs or more still. This would be  1 for me.    2.) diaper changes. It's so hard to keep my son still for a diaper change. It's like some kind of medieval torture for him. I dread it every time. We are so potty training at 18 months.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	1 dishes, absolutely.. cant stand them, I rather scrub the toilet than stand around doing dishes. Also right now I wish someone else would come in and potty train my 3 year old. Its only been two days but I am so done.. just go potty!!  :)     2 That I'm home all the time.. I would love to have a part time job just for a few hours a week just to get to do something else than change diapers, do puzzles or play doh...  And because I'm home all day I'm the one whose supposed to keep the house clean.. I mean he helps sometimes but really its mostly on me and I just get so tired of cleaning it day after day after a friking day|`|F6lZHRkVaa	What irks me most is being stuck in the house constantly. I definitely get my free time, but I don't get to travel. I used to be on the go a lot, I took overseas trips at least twice a year before the baby. Now I have to sit back and watch my husband take business trips to fun cities without me. That just kills me. Because he's going somewhere on business, no one bats an eye. But if I, as a SAHM, wanted to go somewhere fun for the weekend, everyone would think I'm crazy for leaving my kid. And that's what irks me most.|`|NpSVEC2naa	1) worst part of my day is definitly trying to get up in the morning afer a night of being woken up by crying every 3-4 hours. (every morning)     2) i hate being in debt or behind in payments (power ph etc) but my partner isn't fazed by it, i HATE not earning any money for myself! i HATE not being able to get retail therapy, and i would just LOVE to get a full nights sleep, just one would be nice... i also get pretty bugged about not being able to go out with friends, just me. as im still breastfeeding and my daughter refuses the bottle. i also hate how my partner comes home from work and expects the house to be clean, laundry done and dinner on the table. as if i have nothing else to do during the day!
dA9Tcp8Qaa	?? Extremely bad image! They show that you should have sex after knowing the person for all of 5 minutes. They show that if you say 'I love you' it will be happily ever after. It's all crap. Not real life. ??|`|r39EDGhPaa	I never understood why sex is thrown into absolutely everything nowadays.  And it's always meaningless.      But I watch this show called Degrassi.. and it is slightly more realistic, just a lot more dramatic. HAha.|`|V6vAvs0Yaa	As someone who majored in broadcasting, I feel somewhat compelled to answer:    The media does not show bad images of anything. The media shows us images that we want to see.     Media is driven by advertising dollars, and advertising dollars are determined by how many people are watching or consuming the particular media.     There have been a myriad of studies about how Romantic Comedies give such a warped impression on couples, that the more people watch them the more they tend to head towards separation.|`|AA12322129	Yes they do!|`|kgQK3bMlaa	Very true, much of what you see in TV don't reflect how real world is.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	yah i guess
kv8ZFPP1aa	have you had your period, you didn't say?? maybe you should go to the dr and have a blood test done just for reassurance.|`|lPzoVwjXaa	Yes you can trust them.|`|Njf3mot4aa	Trusts the tests!  We all have days like that, especially when we are approaching our period.  :)|`|oOIrXIt0aa	trust the test maybe ur eatting to much and dont notices lol|`|CvTKr3z7aa	go check with a doctor
bcZSIphUaa	The first time it is a weird sensation.    You can't actually feel it...but it's just strange to think that all that stuff is inside you!    You get used to it pretty quickly!    When you are TTC, sperm suddenly becomes precious and you stop getting annoyed at the wet feeling because you love the thought of conceiving.                      *** B A B Y D U S T ***|`|780ByZVEaa	you can't really  feel it until you stand up it can come down your leg, nothing to worry about.|`|cCsN3tcZaa	hmmm not reallyy.. but be careful... because it can get you pregnant|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Nope, Just messy if you stand up right away. After intercourse lay there for about thirty minutes then get up and use the washroom to clean up. You get use to it. Goodluck!|`|qN5iVvAFaa	I don't think so... i like the feeling, i know kinda strange, but we are TTC and i just get a burst of joy when he does|`|q5MGxuyaaa	You won't feel it at all inside of you.  You will feel it when it starts coming out, so I always have a towel ready and hold it there until I can get to a toilet to let it all fall out.  Otherwise, it gets all over your body, yuck!! Oh yeah, and if you are fertile, you should lay down for about 10 minutes afterwards, and if not much comes out, than alot swam up to the egg!  GOODLUCK!!!|`|oOIrXIt0aa	it really doesnt i had the same question till i try it lol    but you hardly feel like!!!     (you wont even know what it you)|`|S009L679aa	its just really wet. it comes right out when he does.|`|JMj8HSaVaa	no ,,you cant feel it.. but you should lay down and put a pillow under your hips .. good luck

This site will explain everything to you and says you have just turned 2 months.|`|62vCoDPjaa	month and a week|`|q2tT8ecraa	Pregnancy is 40 weeks long (10 months, can you believe it?!).  Depending on with whom I am speaking I would tell them "five weeks" or "a month and a week."  People who know will get the five weeks thing, others will do better with the one month and a week thing.|`|QJDbG1F1aa	It's really hard being there's 31 and 20 days in a month and only 7 days in a week. It's just best to go by weeks.

AA10709259	Yes, this is a female name. I was born and grew up in Europe and knew two women named Velina (pronounced Veh-lee-nah.) In my native country, the origin of the name comes from the word "will" and is considered lovely.|`|QYSsvqXyaa	My aunts name is Vienna and we call her aunt V (which I love)I think V names are Strong but cute.|`|LXLLY0kCaa	yes it sounds like a female name. its nice and different|`|0Id85yiYaa	yes, it's a girls' name|`|TffCSzHxaa	I've never heard of the name Velina.

The name is okay, definitely unique. Lina is a cute nickname!|`|tkQq5tR1aa	I wouldn't make it a boys' name. There's nothing masculine about it. As for the alternative spelling 'Velia' I knew someone named 'Velia'. That person was female.
IFDfpbFJaa	I think you should ask them if they have ever heard about it. Also, yes I think you should stay away from their house if you can. It's not good to breathe that in. If you're planning on staying away from their house then you might as well not bother trying to explain the kitty stuff. I'd have your husband do it though, not you.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Oh that's gross, I would stay away anyhow! I might even mention (or have your husband mention) the health risks especially for pregnant women and maybe they will clean it up so they can see you!    Anyhow, as far as the toxoplasmosis goes, chances are if you have been around these cats and that mess before that you were already previously infected by it and unlikely to get infected by them again. I asked my OB about it and he said the concern lies more with cats you are not around ever, like a new one or strays. Still though, I wouldn't take the risk. Plus, who could stand that smell while they have extra sensitive pregnancy nose...lol.    Good luck, hopefully they will just clean it up!|`|84b26tbzaa	STAY AWAY FROM THE IN LAWS HOUSE AND THE LITTER YOU WILL BE FINE|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	i think it would be better if you hubby did the talking for you.  They are his parents and if its coming from him they may take as much offense to it and do something about it yuck!!!|`|6yy0jtzDaa	tell them you need your rest your just not feeling well you can see them other times away from there house invite them to your or go to supper with them my in laws are nasty too they think that they are going to have my daughter all time when i have her too and they have got another thing coming!|`|7cvoxQitaa	Stay away from kitty litter!!! The fecal matter is what you get it from.     Tell the in-laws that your doc has warned you about toxoplasmosis and you are concerned and just want what is best for the unborn baby. See if you can get hubby to explain it to them if possible, I am sure he would be able to get the point across easier and with less stress about hurting their feelings.|`|jiFXPCyUaa	lie...lie like you mean it.  tell them it is not them, you are just worried for the baby, and would like to stay home, or outside for fresh air, so that you feel more comfortable.   no need to start a fight now, stress isn't going to help you. or you can have your husband offer is expert kitty clean up skills to your in laws and have him clean up before you guys go over there. they too should be concerned for your health as it directly relates t your new baby!   *congrats BTW!|`|TTaqeK49aa	I would stay away from the house for sanitary reasons, but not because of toxoplasmosis, its been proven that about one third of the worlds population has already came in contact with the parasite. And since you have cats, you probably already have it. And if it hasnt caused any problems so far, it probably wont. But if you are still concerned about it, talk to your doctor on you next visit.
6yy0jtzDaa	sounds like implatation of the fertilized egg you could be pregp|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.  it sounds like implantation bleeding. Big sign that pregnancy has occured.  Cramping is a sign aswel.

It takes about 48-72 hours for the sperm to make contact with your egg. However, your first time can have a change effect on your cycle. Give it a few days then take a test. Dont take it while your bleeding. If you are worried and cant wait that long then get a blood test done.. its 100% test. Also when you do take it when you first wake up. What the answer is is most likely your result. Also Just letting you know your boyfriend is right... If you panic and are stressed it has and effect on your cycle (delay it for extensive of time, change the flow of your cycle)  Hope this helps you out alittle|`|AA10218110	If you had sex just a week before your period and it starting bleeding, then you will not be pregnant. But its safe not to have sex very close to the days of periods.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	You're going to get your period soon. Nothing to worry about.
gxGsqNPPaa	Are you bleeding heavily with painful cramps? If you are,  how far along are you? If you are only a few weeks, the only thing a doctor will do right now is confirm that you are having one, and will probably tell you to go home and let it happen because that is all you can do. If you are farther than maybe 5 weeks or so, going to a doctor might be necessary to make sure everything is going to take it's course correctly.    Call a close friend or someone to talk to and help you feel better.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    Call up a close friend and get them to take you to the E.R darling.  you need to be seen and checked up on  its may be mis.c but it may be nothing darling.

c7Gv3N3Raa	Im sorry that some people have been rude to you on here^^.  It seems that they 'know' a lot about adoption but nothing about manners and respect.    I can understand why you want closed adoption. It's a lot easier on the child to grow up with one mom and one dad. It would be so confusing for them to have someone stopping by every week or two claiming they are their birth mom.    And so what if you want a kid to fulfill your dreams of being a mother? You have to want to be a mom before you can fulfill the children's needs. I would be worried if you hopped on here and said "I hate children but i kind of feel bad for the ones who don't have a mother and father so I'm going to adopt one to take care of it, but i don't really want one...."  The people above me went a overboard with criticizing you. Adoption requires you to want a child and a family, and to want to give that child a family. You're not being unreasonable with your question at all.    Here's a link for fees/costs varying by agencies: http://www.adopting.org/adoptions/learn-...    Also, explore the site for your other questions-there's an answer to all of your questions on that site.    Good luck and ignore the rude ones.|`|AScl8iyMaa	I am adopted via closed adoption.  I met my birth siblings. I have too much respect for my adoptive parents to do that to them i feel like it would make them uncomfortable.  If you do this, you need to make sure your child has no trace of their past.  the internet makes it very easy to find people i did 5 years ago, at 14. from a hospital bracelet and a picture that had my sisters name on it so i myspaced her.     Anyways, you have to go through social services and they have to come and inspect your house interview family and friends. They go through a lot. I know you need an attorney. i was adopted in in 1989 and it cost my parents $26,000. and in 1998 when my brother was born it was $29,000. Keep in mind you do get most of the money back  on your tax return if i am correct.     -- dont worry about the ignorant comment i saw about you not being ready to adopt.  I understand where you are coming from. Open adoption makes a lot of feelings come about.  From personal experience i am greatful i am adopted and i want to have a closed adoption with my children also.    good luck. and if you need any advice about telling your child or questions for me as an adopted child feel free to e-mail me =]|`|2wyDALHgaa	Simply contact an adoption agency in your area and speak to an intake worker.  They will answer any of your questions regarding the processes, wait times and the costs involved.      Also, contact social services in your area and enquire about adopting children already in their system.  While they are in "foster care" they are not foster children waiting to go back to their birth parents.  They are children permenantly removed from their birth families for any number of reasons and they are currently living in foster homes waiting to be adopted.  They are all sized, shapes, colours and ages and I'm sure that there would be someone perfect for your family just waiting.  Adoptions through foster care are also free in most areas or have very minimal costs (under $1000).|`|kf7XLE8kaa	If you adopt through foster care, it's free.  The requirements are that you need to be able to meet the child's needs, financially, emotionally (i.e. understand the tremendous loss inherent in separating families), mentally, etc.  You'll have a lot of paperwork to get through, and they'll explain any additional requirements as you go along.    If you'd like to adopt an infant, the requirements are lots of money to line the pockets of the agency's workers and management, and a belief that other women's children exist to fulfill your dreams...and that other women are only vessels to carry YOUR child for you.  (Often, when PAP's notice that the infant adoption process is inherently shady, and they attempt to speak to the mother about other options, they are cut off from contact with her, and the adoption agency will refuse to work with them again.)    I could be off base here, but the wording of your question suggests that you are interesting in adoption as a method of fulfilling yourself.  So that you know, adoption is supposed to be about meeting the needs of children, NOT fulfilling the wants of adults.  Children who have lost their entire family do not have the emotional resources to be the dream child you've always wanted.  Please learn about adoption from the point of view of the adoptees (and the first parents) before moving forward with your plans.|`|gEBBpvlFaa	Why do you want the adoption to be closed? Scared of the child's mother coming back and reclaiming him/her? You're pathetic. Adoption isn't about providing YOU with a kid! It's about finding homes for children who need them. You aren't ready, and by the looks of your post, you never will be.|`|q0olpfS1aa	I think this is a good link to get you started:    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ado...    It's not what you asked for; it's the link to the first results page when you type in "adoption search" on Google.  Each one of those results represents thousands - millions - of adoptees who are searching for any grain of information about themselves.  Ethnicity.  Medical History.  Do they have siblings?  Does anyone else in the world look like them?  Take a look.  Those are real people, who are hurting terribly.  I don't mean to be cruel, but please consider the fact that perhaps your child will be posting there someday.    I am the child of a closed adoption.  My life was a good one, and my adoption a positive experience.  But I grew up wondering all those things I just listed, and many more.  I wonder if you've thought about your child completing the "family tree" exercise in 4th grade?  Did you know that when it came time for me to complete that, my teacher said, in front of the whole class, that I could just go to the library while everyone else worked on that assignment?  Do you want that for your child?    I'm also, like you, a prospective adoptive parent.  I understand the desire to bond with a child and the questions around navigating the First Family/Adoptive Family relationship.  I'm an adult though, and I can navigate those waters.  Our (me, my husbands, and the First Mother/Father's) child's needs come before mine, plain and simple; I have lived the life of "history beginning with me" and having to put on the cloak of an identity that never quite fit.  It doesn't diminish the love I have for my parents in any way - that is enormous and can never be shaken - but I had the right to know who I was, just like everyone else.  And I don't.  I will never do that to a child, and I hope that something that I've said here will get you to consider not doing it to yours.

7G6Mzxy8aa	i am having the same problem at the moment with my 3 1/2 year old daughter ( not so much feeding herself ) but she seems to hate preschool i take her and when i say goodbye she goes nuts screaming grabbing onto me etc i just keep walking it's heart wrenching i know because as im walking away i can hear her screams for me how can a mother do that i hear you ask well i keep telling myself she HAS to go to school in september so i am hoping that she will settle down although this has been going on since she started preschool since last september but the staff there reassure me that when i am gone it only takes about 5 Min's for her to calm down so that's why i carry on taking her there and putting my self through the pain because i keep telling myself it will do her good in the long run good luck :)|`|7kJFmyxdaa	When my son was ready to go to preschool, he did not want to go either. He wanted to stay home with Mommy. I talked to the preschool teacher where he would be attending. She told me it would be all right for me to come to school with him for the first week or so. I did this and by the third day he was telling me I didn't have to stay with him anymore. He even started riding the bus.     Sometimes going to a new place which is not familiar to them is a scary experience for them. You have to gradually "ween" them away from you. Once they get use to the new surroundings and begin making friends, it is usually not long before they become all right with going to preschool.    I hope this helps.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	You take him.  You hand him over.  You say "cheerio, see you later".  Even if you are distressed yourelf at leaving him, you behave cheerfully. If you show distress, so will he.  You walk away.    Or,    You let HIM start running YOUR life from now until he decides he no longer wants to, which may not be until after you have died.|`|b8e002cc5b802e1aa15d64b7ce269beeaa	take him there... leave him there... he will see his friends eating and copy them... seems harsh but probably the quickest way he will learn|`|lBRud4y5aa	Big T is right. He will run your life if you let him. You need to give him a proper explanation that he can understand. even if you have to drag him to preschool it won't kill him and he will remember your explanation even though he doesn't like it. The longer lack of control goes on the harder it becomes to correct. With the eating. Again why should he bother if you do it for him? Explain the deal, then hand him a spoon. If he throws a wobbler, walk away and ignore him. Whatever you do don't give in. That will reinforce his belief that he can get you to do pretty much whatever takes his fancy. It's tough with a bawling kid I know, but it will improve rapidly if you have the resolve to deal with it.|`|GXFQAKeraa	as everyone has said, you pretty much make him go even if he cries and screams. the only other advice i have is to be sickeningly cheerful about it. the night before, have him help (even if he is just pouting) pick out his clothes or food for lunch etc. in the morning, sing a song or talk (in an overly excited voice) about all the fun stuff he's going to do. once at the school, if you are able to get him interested in a project, stay for an extra minute to get him into something but DON'T SNEAK AWAY! make sure you say bye or he'll freak. if he just clings to your leg and won't let go, have the teacher help you untangle him. unless the teachers or kids are mean (which they most likely aren't), he'll be loving it within a day or two. if he's extremely dependent on you, it may take longer but it will be the best thing for him to go and learn to be without you. as for training him to eat... there isn't any training involved. he is definitely old enough and capable enough to eat on his own. at school, he won't go hungry and the teachers won't let him go without eating. at home you can help but making him feed himself at home. start with cutting his food into bite size bites and small eating utensils. to get him to eat, you can do one of two things. you can make him sit at the table until he's finished his food or you can get pedisaure to make sure he gets the vitamins he needs while he only eats smaller portions. he'll get hungry enough to eat once he realizes you aren't feeding him anymore. also, tell him everything you're doing. i.e. son, i think it's time you start eating with your big boy fork/spoon. here they are. i'm going to eat my food at the same time. once he realizes you aren't kidding, he'll admit that he could do it.|`|64f66662454c0ed446e32154c55e475aaa	when i was working in a pre-school we had quite good sucess with the child leaving mum and not the other way round,     stand at the door  say goodbye  let the staff get your son to leave you at the door  get them to ring your mobile after half hour to let you know how he gets on    some it takes quite a while but you need to keep at it and he will get the idea that mummy is coming back    talk to the pre-school staff get them to help him settle in    as for feeding himself he will see the others doing it and will copy again chat to the staff    don't be put off i am sure he will be fine|`|ekAH05qWaa	well i dont think he needs to go to preschool yet if hes only 3 unless you have no other option.  i think u should wait till hes 4.  but if u do have to send him to preschool then u should take him one day to see whats its like but you would stay.  when i was 4 my mom took me to preschool for part of the day and we stayed to watch the kids play to see what preschool is like. hope this helps :)|`|TDVIb4SBaa	My youngest son did not take to preschool either,oh I tried however it was of no use.

However, if you're pregnant or suspect that you're pregnant, you should not take Plan B, since it's not effective after pregnancy has begun.     Although small amounts of progestin can pass into breast milk, no side effects have been identified.

And to be honest you just have to keep telling them that anyone who won't be your friend because you are friends with someone else is probably not your friend. And you can talk until you are blue in the face and it's not going to help her now, she is too young. But as she gets older she will understand and know not to waste her tears or time on these kind of people.     I told my daughter to name all of her other friends and when she did I told her, then that's all you need. I told her that most times when we get older we weed out the losers and we only truly have 1 or 2 good friends anyway.     I remember when I was little my mom use to tell me "you don't have any friends." I laugh now.    I tell my daughter that a friend is a very special title and that we don't give that title to anybody. I tell her that children use that term too loosely. Just because you go to school with someone that doesn't make them your friend.     I hope this helps

As long as you are responsible about it and letting your parents know when you won't be home I wouldn't have an issue with it.|`|jkgl9WMgaa	Wow, what a burden you put on your grandmother. If you are old enough to spend the night together, you are old enough to get married and get your own place.|`|jIF5FRUpaa	My boyfriend and I met while studying. I lived in a shared house and when my boyfriend and I got together we instantly moved into the same house. My parents knew from the beginning and were okay with it. They always treated me like an adult from an early age and I could make my own decisions. Of course it's depending, how conservative your parents are and how much you trust each other.
xue72D76aa	The three white lines are a clear indication of a girl.  They are the bones that structure the vulva.  Congrats!|`|hJoB7VR1aa	The 3 lines are the vulva and clitoris. Little boys look like a turtle sticking its head out.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	The three lines is the vulva.
2gegv4smaa	No,without having sex nor sperm donor can't become pregnet.    clinically a sperm must enter an ovulating female egg thru passage in the vagina. If there was partial pentration by the penis, then, yes, a sperm cell can swim the rest of the way and fertilize the egg. If there was no penetration or ejaculation near the beginning of the vagina, then , no ,pregnancy is virtually impossible.|`|1tLmTjBxaa	by keeping a pillow in her panty|`|prUTCU8raa	It's PREGNANT not pregnet.

z0Ynd4zRaa	Don't worry, they'll be fine :) I know it can be scary at first, but just know that they're safe. You can't spend your days thinking about it, you'll go insane. Besides, your little ones have a long time until they go to school, so just enjoy them and don't worry about that kind of stuff right now. I'm more worried that I'll miss the girls when they go. Schools are pretty safe, they'll be okay.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	people who worry as much as you do home school.|`|AA10700334	why are worrying about stuff that's like 3 yrs away?  you keeping at home with you is no answer ...who is to say some crazed maniac doesn't break into your home and hurts you and your kids all because you kept them at home and at least they would have been safe if they had been at daycare|`|cYsPx9sSaa	its not that bad, its life, you cant stop whats has to happen|`|nfzQkvqraa	I understand where you're coming from, but you CAN'T worry about things like that.  It will drive you crazy.  Those kinds of thing can happen any time anywhere.  I send my youngest to a preschool where the only way you can get in is if you have the card to swipe at the door.  Still, who's to say that a crazy parent who has that card to swipe wouldn't wind up going loopy and doing something.  Or an employee.  It's all over the place.  You can't think about it too much.|`|6FkMhCOnaa	I'm not a parent, but I know its perfectly normal for mothers to worry alot about their children, especially new mothers. My answer for you is this: there is ALWAYS going to be some danger out there that you are going to be afraid of, but you can't let all of the bad things that there is a slight possibility of happening keep you from being in the real world.   What if you were at home and a tsunmai hit you?  What if your house got broken into?  What if there was an earthquake and your children were napping upstairs and you were downstairs?  There are always things to be afraid of, but that is no reason to keep from living in the real world.   Send your children to a daycare you know and trust, and they should be just fine.  I wish you the best!|`|va4dh98baa	I understand being really worried about kids going to schools now a days.  However, you can never know what is going to happen in schools today.  The easiest solution would be to home school your kids.  However, I do not recommend this either because it shelters the children to much.  So even though you can never be completely satisfied with your children in schools that is the best thing for them.  I speak from personal knowledge that sending your kids to school is a better solution that keeping them home all the time.  Because they don't develop socially the way that they should. Good luck|`|DDFSITiYaa	I remember when my eldest was young, toddler age and I would get emotional and teary over thinking about putting her on a school bus.  Guess what - by the time she was 5 and had preschool under her belt there was no way I could NOT let her go.  She was so full of life and desire to LEARN!  She was so excited by doing new things and learning it made it easy.  You start to see how much they gain from education and how proud it makes them and how many new ideas are formed it is so exciting for them!     Anything can happen at any school but if you are uncomforable with public school, go private.  If not, then research your public schools find out their security and try to get involved with the PTO early and volunteer often.  You will make a difference not just with your own kids but with the community.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	are you worried about taking them with you to the grocery store? the park? the post office? are you going to let them out of your house at all? schools aren't any more dangerous than anywhere else.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You can't guarantee it won't happen.    You also can't guarantee that a drunk driver won't mount the pavement one day and hit you all as you walk home.  You can't guarantee that the next nutter will decide that the school is too well defended and decide to go shoot up the local supermarket while you are there with them.  You can't guarantee that a plane won't crash on your house, killing your kids when they would have been completely safe had they been at daycare.    No, I wasn't worried, not at the point that I'd chosen a good, safe school for them. There are some risks that are so small that they simply cannot be sensibly avoided. Wrapping your kids in cotton wool does not make them safe - it makes them more likely to have accidents when they have to deal with the big wide world without you.|`|vue9NOhYaa	This sort of thing makes the news specifically because it IS a vanishingly rare occurence.      You cannot possibly protect your children from every danger in life -- but it makes no sense to obsess about the the dangers that are one  in a million or less and, realistically, out of your control.  (You DO eventually have to let them out of your sight.  Bad things happen [rarely] everywhere in the world.)|`|u5F22mEbaa	There will be a string of things for you to worry about as they age, and statistically, your kids are safer at school than anywhere else, even home.  As a mom, you need to know that GENERALLY, what they get at school is better than you can provide at a certain age - you may have the opportunity to tour your local school or even make choices about where they go.  But mostly, what I'm learning now is that we take it one day at a time - there will be thinigs to worry about along the way, but as a whole, I am going to enjoy like slice of life I have with them TODAY.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Shootings happen more in high school and universities. I actually go to a mid-sized university which is about 10 minutes from Virginia Tech, the school that had that massive shooting in April 2007. Now that was scary!!    Ever since that happened, schools at all levels have increased security and come up with escape plans in case of a shooter. They are doing a lot to keep kids safe.    You just have to remember that there is ALWAYS risk anytime you leave your house. Or even in your house (burgulars, a fire, etc.).    I'm not saying that to freak you out more, I'm just saying that you have to live life and not be scared of the "what if's".. I mean, still take precautions when you can but in all honesty, its highly unlikely your kids would ever be in that situation of a school shooting.
OYYYNCyCaa	take you baby now to the hospital NOW    they will have some CT scans done to find out exactly what is going on    ask for a paediatrician to see your son    and they will send you to see neurosurgeon     your local doctor is not a specialist in this area thats why you need to see paediatrician and neurosurgeon|`|KpoR3MiQaa	It sounds like a typical epileptic seizure, if he does this after watching TV or is more prone to haviing them after watching tv it almost confirms it    Take him to your docotr who will put him on anti-seizure drugs, dont leave it too long as the seizures must be incredibly uncomfortable for his|`|AA12324370	The same sort of thing was happening to me when I was a baby.  Once I was about a year old, I stopped having them.  Then I started again when I was about 8.  I was later diagnosed with Epilepsy.  But either way, I'm perfectly normal otherwise and have really had no lasting effects.|`|01zxefjnaa	I'm sure you have are working with a neurologist and have had a battery of test for tumors etc with a mri.   I have heard of growing out of them . His threshold  will become stronger as he gets older I have read. hope everything turns out ok . w|`|AA12324049	I was born with epilepsy or it was caused by my delivery and I seizures regularly when I was a baby.  I was eventually put on medication when I was about 5 and the doctors began reducing the dosages prior to my 15th birthday and by my 16th birthday they ceased. I later had some as an adult but I always knew when I was going to have one ("aura") because mine are caused by pain.  As long as I avoid pain and take care of myself (reduce stress, get enough sleep, etc.) I'm fine.  I haven't had one in over 8 years now.  This is just my case and many others are different.  But I applaud you for keeping a close eye on your son and keep asking questions!  If you aren't satisfied with the answers, seek a 2'nd opinion, etc. until you feel satisfied with the diagnoses and advice you are given. It is also very important to do your own research.  I was once prescribed an anti-seizure medication in my early 30's when I was going through a bad spell and after being on it a month I looked it up on the internet and found that it could negate the effectiveness of my birth control bill.  I called the office in shock to confirm this and after doing so I was flabbergasted that my physician never mentioned that potentially life changing side effect.  So, since then, I have learned to become my own best advocate for me and my family for whatever issue comes about.|`|9a8Nfcbjaa	Febrile seizures are definitely scary (really any kind are when it's your child!).  If your son hasn't seen a neurologist, I would take him there.  If it's the specialist's opinion that they are febrile, I would trust that for now, unless symptoms change.
QB5D0rG4aa	I would wait until you miss your period to check because sometimes the hpt tests can't read the hormone in your body yet. good luck !|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	i hear it's 10-12 days after ovulation.i'm in the same boat...i'm wanting so bad to test now....but my period isn't due until the 20th. good luck and lots of baby dust!!!!1|`|lhn1wNoeaa	you can check 5 days before your period by HPT.|`|udbuXVl4aa	This is based solely on my current experience.  I ovulated on or around Monday, Dec. 29 and my last period started Dec. 15.  I was expecting to start again about Jan. 12.  I was surprised that my husband and I achieved it but we did :-)  On Wednesday, Jan. 7, I had a gut feeling and went to the dollar store to buy a cheap test just in case I was wrong or having wishful thinking.  After diluted urine and testing in the afternoon, I picked up such a faint line, that you had to manipulate the test just to see anything.  After about 3 days of getting the same line, I went and got a First Response Early Result test and it came out with 2 lines, indicating a positive!  I'm currently about 7.5 weeks pregnant, saw and heard a heartbeat on ultrasound and everything seems to be perfect.  To answer your question, I got my faint positive about 5 days before I missed my period.  It's probably not normal but at the same time, every woman's body is different and will experience different surges of hormones at different times - some sooner than others.  I would say the soonest would be 5 days away from your period but no more than that.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	5 days before your expected period. best of luck. my husband and i have to wait till next week to find out if we are. baby dust going your way.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Most test will only be accurate about 5 days before your period, that's assuming you make enough hCG to be detected.|`|N0rMaN3Waa	5 days before your MISSED period with and early detection test... 4 days before your expected period date...|`|8mchLCQhaa	I found out at 10 days past ovulation.
IoWoDxG8aa	I am in the same boat as you. Fertility calculators say about between 4 days late and 8 days late (I have a weird cycle this past month so I am not exaclty sure when I ovulated aside from the physical signs from my cm)   I took a pregnancy test last night and it turned out negative. If I were you, I would wait a few days and take another one in the morning. Also, stress could have affected your period causing a late period. that is the only other thing I can guess what is going on with me!   Hope u find out soon!|`|Qcu8cO4Yaa	go to your obgyn and they will make you take a blood test at a lab to confirm whether you are pregnant or not, and its only been 7 days, your period may just be changin cycles|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	yes...i know it's hard....but I would wait another week! good luck!!!!!|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	well your eather to  stress or your hormones aren't high enough to show in a test. go and get a blood test if need. baby dust to you.|`|SzNmGV0Daa	Blood test, urine tests are not 100% in testing HCG levels.

NZKiSfVOaa	say to her ' hey, im having my sweet sixteen soon, would you like to come? i mean no pressure you dont have to if its to far and to hard to get here, you can stay at my house for the night, and i just want you at a  mile stone in my life since we have been friends for ages'. and done, no pressure or anything (:|`|KwJDWvB3aa	just ask!...if she cant come the she cant come.. maybe have her stay with you for a couple of days!..your perents can drive you half way and her perents can drive her half way and then you can pick her up somewhere in the middle and take her back to your house! and do the same for her going home...thats what me and one of my frineds do.|`|hstwNjNaaa	Ask her if you want her to come, but like you said it's a long journey. Tell her as far in advance as you can, so she can plan the trip if she is coming.    But definitely invite her, she'd probably love to see you again!|`|VbUpMxrvaa	No of course not!  It'll be a good way to catch up & become better friends again.  :)  happy birthday|`|tu7aqUoxaa	it doesn't hurt to ask|`|i2SiEsU0aa	I dont think its too much, its not like she lives all the way across the world.|`|gyhVnBN9aa	No, its not much to ask her for. you guys are still friends and still keep in touch, so it would be really nice of you to invite her i bet she will go.|`|NzcQ1Skjaa	I think you should ask her to your sweet 16.
GLnVPp2Caa	He is probably hesitating to discipline her because he doesn't see her that often and doesn't want to be the bad guy.  It's no fun to discipline when you don't see your kids that often to begin with.    First, you and hubby need to come to an agreement to be on the same page and support each other and that not disciplining her is doing her a dis-service, not a favor.    My thought, is that you and hubby work together on a common solution that you can both live with.  He is going to have to take the ball on this one and support you.  If she can't use manners at the table, then dinner is over and her plate gets picked up?    Your step-daughter is going to try to play the "sides" card because she is old enough to know how to do it.    She needs to learn this habit.  It's going to affect her in school, dating, etc.     Good luck!  Remember, it has to be a team effort!|`|hVVALFAPaa	Perhaps video or audio tape a meal. Maybe she doesn't really see how bad/annoying/nasty/ill-mannered her slurping is. I don't know you should try to make this unobtrusive (tape her without her knowing about it) or if you should tell her straight up that you are taping her to show her how icky it is or if you should make up something to explain the camera, like you want to record 'family' meals so that your hubby has something to remember her by when she isn 't there.|`|cteyFJxhaa	You pick up your plate and say...ok guys I've got to go.  I know this pet peeve of mine with the chomping noises is a little intense but it really upsets me so rather than end up angry and causing everyone a nasty evening I'm going to the other room.    Like you said, she's not over often so it's not worth causing a big rift over and your husband can have 20 min. of one on one time with the kid.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Oh, believe me I'm a stepmom too with boys that use to eat the same way. It took a few times and others at the table to help. I would just tell them laughingly but meaning it "do you hear yourself? When you start dating the boys are going to look at you like what the heck and you'll be embaressed, so try not to make those noises for you sake."  I wouldn't want that happening to you.} plus ask others at the table to help out by saying whats that sound and giggle a little.Hope it helps|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I would just continue asking her nicely to stop. My 8 year old stepdaughter eats very loudly and it drives me crazy too! I ask/tell her several times a meal, and I think I must be the only one to do so. I was hoping she would grow out of it soon.     I do like the previous poster's idea about making a video or audio tape of it. maybe she really doesnt realize she is doing it|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I am not aware of how you can make smacking and sucking noises if you are chewing with your mouth closed?  I'd start there.|`|AA11206135	Honestly?? Give her one chance then move her meal into a different room. Tell her people with good manners get to eat together. I have 5 kids and I had to do this with one of them. He got the message quickly.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I guess you could simply ask her if she eats that noisily all the time or just at home.  That will help to identify (hopefully) whether she's doing it on purpose or not.  I would then remind her that it's rude and very distracting to others.  Not to mention that whether it's right or not, she will probably be made fun of by her peers if she chews like that.    I'm not being rude-but I have to share this with you- I used to be a very noisy eater as well.  I would often times chew with my mouth open.  Which I also find as very annoying as an adult.  I got in trouble so many times for it.  It turns out that I had a deviated septum.  And not like how famous people have a slightly deviated septum just so they can have an excuse to get plastic surgery.  I literally couldn't breathe out of my nose.  (between that and allergies that were later diagnosed)  So make sure you are positive this is intentional or bad manners and not something deeper.  (although I'll admit that would be rare)|`|2xS1Jro7aa	How old is she? If she is younger I would say 8/9 or younger you could A. try playing a game to "learn" table manners and when she does it right praise her saying how good of manners she has! And sound very happy about it. And tell her that she has the best manners of any child her age and so on. B. If she is older she should understand when you ask her not to and if she is claiming shes not doing it then it is most likely to annoy you and if she continues make a comment about how you wanted to go out to eat but that you cant take her out to eat untill she learns good manners. You could also try spending one on one girl time with her to help earn her respect then she will want to please you instead of annoy you. If she is not doing it on purpose you could still try to teach her good manners but do it in a fun way.  C. If she is 12 or under you could set up a rewards system and add stuff like when she does chores, cleans up after her self, dosnt talk back, and a few other things also add in there if she eats dinner with good manors. Let her choose some things she would like as a reward it could be a small object or maybe a big one if she has to work longer and get more stickers for it. Or it could be to go and do something that she enjoys. That way its not targeting her one thing but she will want to get the reward so she should change her behavior it might also help with a few other things. Children strive on praise and reward! Good luck and I hope that i helped some! Sorry if I had some words spelled wrong im in a hurry no time to spell check!

Not like getting drunk though :)  The only problem if you invite so many is that you will need a large venue because you can't go ice-skating or cinema with like 50 people and it could be very expensive!!    Think of all the people who would invite you to theirs cut off the people that you're friends with but don't really talk to much. Just keep cutting people off and remember if you cut off one girl from a group, then you've got to cut off the rest or she'll feel left out!!

You know what I mean? ;]|`|6tQZppzOaa	my crushs mom is bffs with my mom so he comes over my house sometimes. so i dont act shy or nervous with him because im loud with him. since im so loud with him i dont get nervous one tiny bit with him. just be yourself and act like u would if he was a girl. lol thats wut i do.|`|dPULl5hjaa	with time and as you get much older|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	take a deep breath  and just talk  take me as an example, i had a crush a couple of years back  and i used to think of a way of how i could talk to him  and then one day i was standing behind him on line  and he turned around and talked to me  and we became friends  eventually i found out he was taken but whatever i tried lol  but all you have to do is talk to him  and when you see him try not to giggle or smile  think of him as just another person  if you have a friend that is good friends with him  have them introduce him to you    good luck  =)|`|1ZGDnSX4aa	there's nothing you can do to stop Looking nervous, but take slow breaths in your nose and out of your mouth. chew gum, and try making a joke. good luck, sorry i don't have more|`|8NFLpbJAaa	I have the same thing (: x|`|fvqXiBEVaa	Being nervous around kids that teens like (crushes). Just remember and remind yourself that they might be nervous too and that they're just normal people and if they know you're nervous they might be able to relate.|`|QDAzw9zSaa	Hi!, been nervous is part of every day life, if you like a person and you become nervous, you can suppress it by, asking how was your day, you are looking awesomely great, have you got anything to do 2morrow?.    ask some few questions, and trust me you will feel comfortable with the person, and that will help your nervous :-), and the more you comfortable with the person, the more you will be less worried about been nervous.    Hope this helps :-)
H0JnT2Epaa	No he likes you|`|vXe4dehRaa	He just has a crush. With guys your age there is never a deeper meaning.|`|kYQ35kBZaa	i think he likes you and is probably too shy to approach you. maybe you should ask him out to a movie. i am sure he will say yes.
PQw92IGHaa	If you read further in the story of Sarah, having her maid sleep with her husband wasn't all it was cracked up to be.|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	are you serious...or do you just want to sleep with her maid??? Maybe you guys can get fertility tests first of all and than go from there. However, it sounds like you just really want to do s-c-r-e-w her maid, which if that is the case...than maybe you shouldnt be married.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	I really don't like to sound mean but here go. Why in the would you want to do that instead of going to the doctor and get yourselves checked to see if any thing is wrong? best of luck going your way.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	weirdo .....if u were my husband i would've cut ur d-i-c-k for mentioning anything like that :(. i feel sorry for ur wife. Idiot!!!! plus that was old testament.....not the new one when we have laws now....|`|PFjUjbOdaa	going to the doctor or trying with assistance is possible the best thing to do before sleeping with someone else.  Have you talked about this with your wife, what does she think??  That should be a SUPREME last resort if money is conflicting things.    Personally, i would get upset if my husband asked me that before we tried assistance or doctor.|`|KdqaGnlwaa	lol.... your silly.. try and convince your wife with that.|`|d3c30c997a493d45035b45c61e8d3827aa	maybe you're the problem, why don't you let her sleep with your best friend.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Oh, goodness.  And. . . who is getting the gratification at the end?  You or your wife?  I'd say you.
tWKZVDG2aa	The thing is, by wanting to be in a relationship with him this badly you are probably alienating him and being "annoying".  I know it's hard but you have to move on.  Why not try being friends, and you never know what might happen in the future.    You can't imagine loving anyone else perhaps because he was your first love.  You are still young and have a lot of life left yet.     Good Luck :)|`|2cstdEkIaa	let go before you turn into a stalker
KdCzS5Q4aa	Some women don't finish puberty til their late teens (eg 19) so be patient, it'll come.|`|JVPt99Hxaa	omg y do u complain that u don't have any hair girl you are Lucky i would love 2 be like that :D|`|z3Oed98laa	Well i would consider that a good thing, hair might come in later but dont worry about it too much. Many people shave to get rid of it so consider yourself lucky. Seeing as u have ur period and everything else i dont think its delayed period. You may still get hair later on or u might not...hope this helps ?|`|hJoB7VR1aa	Don't worry. Be elated that you don't have to shave. I have been thinking about paying good money to have my hair permanently removed on my legs so that I can quit shaving.   Do you have a strong Indian heritage? My Great -Grandmother was 1/2 Cherokee and never shaved a day in her life. Oh how I wish I would have received more of her genes.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	you wont finish puberty until about the age of 17-19. and also if you have a close blood relative who is native american (indian) the you wont have much hair.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You could still grow hair, however hair growth usually takes place just before your periods start. There's nothing wrong with you, you are probably just not a hairy person, I know you want to feel grown up and shave, but really most women would pay millions to have your "problem". At fifteen there's a very good chance you are still developing so just relax and worrying more about school work than hair. I know plenty of college students who aren't completely through puberty, sometimes it takes some time.|`|YGvKisOoaa	no shaving! wooooohoooo :D your lucky. but i don't think anythings wrong with you. my friend is like that, she never has legs or arm hair or anything. I don't think anythihngs wrong, but if you are seriously worried, talk to your mom and bring it up next doctors appointment.|`|fk8Lz10Aaa	your so lucky!!! lol  but i dunno alot of peoples bodies do thier own thing in their own time.  like every girls period doesnt start at the same time.  although you could talk to a doctor if you really want.  and your chest wouldnt be fully grown by now cuz im 15 and mine are still getting bigger and bigger (They wont stop growing and big bras are fricking exspensive!!!! and i mean big :( )  lol  x|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Don't worry! You're lucky to not have to worry about shaving! And if anybody makes any comments about you not having any hair just look disgusted and tell them you don't have hair because you can be bothered to shave! Lol..    I didn't even start my periods 'till I was nearly 17. I'm 20 now and very rarely have to shave as hair simply doesn't grow on my legs or underarms...I thinks it's because my head hair is blonde and pretty fine...people with darker, thicker hair probably have more of a problem with hair.     x|`|UVblLg4naa	can i just say i envy u like crazy?    im 15, have all the hair in all the right places, and my chest isnt fully grown! Ahhh! I hate it!    Cutting urself under the arms shavin is not pleasant (especially wen u hav 2 use deodorant afterwards, Ouch!)    and at least u dont hav 2 worry about bikini waxes for a while (again, im tryin 2 avoid it, but i fear it is inevitable as summer approaches)    Enjoy the smoothness of non hairy underarms while u can...|`|emkT1a6raa	It's alright, some people go at their different pace :]|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Genetics     Your family may not have all that arm pit hair.  consider yourself lucky.|`|KwJDWvB3aa	puberty dosent stop till your 18 -21...it lasts a long time...not just like a month.... so you will have it for a while. one of my frineds never got underarm hair..some people just dont get it..but you will...in timee..be happy you dont have it for now. its just a pain.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	just be glad you dont have hairy armpits.|`|pWA3gybAaa	maybe you are not genetically prone to get that much under arm hair|`|rmcEFak0aa	dddd|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	You wont finish puberty untill around 18/19 so don't worry aboutit.

It's hard to like shave every single day.|`|rjVALevtaa	Yes, you have finished puberty. The final stage of puberty for girls is getting your period. You won't get getting any more body hair and quite frankly I don't see why you'd want to!     Consider yourself lucky, having less hair means you'll have to shave less.|`|7RLZZNzXaa	My love you should not worry about these things. My twelve year old daughter is starting puberty, her chest is broadening ect ect.   We are all different and you will have it soon. Do not worry and let your mind concentrate on other things.    Good luck  Portia|`|AQ5JzkzZaa	think of it as a positive, i hate having to shave my underarms, and legs.  but i shave everywhere, i cant stand hair.  you mature at your own speed, if you feel like something may be wrong contact your doctor or ask your parents, they will help a lot.    goodluck. :)|`|t8HPCzrOaa	girl your luckyyyy that you dont have hair i wish i dont have hair at long on my legs cause its take forever something to come off and plus it grows back so fastt so be luckuuu|`|horefBCyaa	uhh yah i woulld definitely not complain that i didn't have armpit hair! haha that's how my sister was. she was 15-16 and had like 4 armpit hairs.

NKvUI4VAaa	both of those names are totally adorable  luvvv itttt|`|RI1brp91aa	Taiven Gauge - I think Taven sounds fine, a little different but fine, but Gauge sounds like a car gauge or last name.    Adriana Star- I like Adriana but Star seems a little superficial, like, think when the baby grows up and has the middle name star. You could name it Adriana Eclipse or Adriana Sun or Adriana Moon|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Adriana Star?|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that they are unique and that if that is what you have agreed on and that is what you love, and you can imagine yelling that name out, and singing that name, and always loving that name then use them, I wouldn't personally use them, but you aren't me!!!!!!!!!Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bfNDLbVqaa	the first names are both beautiful    personally I'm not into the last names though.|`|IOQshyGMaa	Taiven Gauge is unusual but quite nice.

J3TRJPIwaa	I was on the pill or nuva ring for a total of 4 years and it took us 4 months to get pregnant. We didn't really "try" we just took out the birth control and had a it will happen when it happens attitude. I will warn you though, my body was going through withdraws of the birth control and each of those 3 months that I wasn't pregnant I was testing because I thought I was. It could have been all in my head too but I think it had to deal with stopping the BC. My 4th month I just felt different. I know tow families that were on BC one took 6 months to conceive the other got pregnant their first month.

9087c63bf667d25bf1ebbecfe37cae22aa	SIMPLE?  What he needs is strict rules right now, because if their simple he may figure he can just bypass them.  Now an option if he seems like he is going to be violent against his father is to threaten to call the police, and if need be, do it.  Its better that you get help for him than a stranger that doesn't know him like you do.  He needs to understand that in the real world, ditching classes (metaphorically work) and failing is just going to lead his life downhill and end up possibly homeless.   He needs to set out his priorities, and you can help with that by taking away some of his privileges.   If he runs away from home, report him as a runaway.|`|zPAtHMKhaa	This is a combination of hormones, the wrong friends and maybe drugs.

People with Masters Degrees are having difficulty finding employment, so if he cannot obtain a High School Diploma he is really going to screw himself.  His behavior is unacceptable and he needs to get the message, fast.  Guess what, employers do not want immature problems on their payroll.  He will be lucky if he can get a job at McDonalds!|`|rid4brOnaa	It is obvious that you and your husband have been too lax in the discipline department.

Certainly, his dad shouldn't punch him back, but a hand or paddle should have been applied to his bottom years ago. I'm afraid that, at 17, he is about to become a "police matter" soon. Maybe jail will straighten him out. He will be begging for all those missed spankings by the time his fellow inmates are through with him.|`|3GmOHatIaa	He just needs an *** beating and a reality check. YOURE the adults here so show him that! Being soft and not being the authority figure is only enabling him to better himself. If you don;t do something now it will only be worse for him down the road.|`|gwUMipsUaa	This is why a butt smack from toddlerhood works wonders.  Those kids know the limits, and eventually respect the parents.    But for now, teenage boot camp is in order.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Hey that was me except no dad in the picture. By the time I had gotten to that point there wasn't anything anyone could say that would have affected me. I knew I was messed up and joined the service. It saved my life. I would see if you can sit down and talk. No name calling or threats. Open conversation with no repercussions for what is said. You might get him to open up who knows.|`|nbSp469Waa	That is what happened to my brother around 17, and he got into drugs.  No matter what my parents said or did, he would yell, scream and hit things.  One day my mom had a heart to heart with him, she was in tears talking to him.  His bad behavior lasted about a week more, then he changed his entire attitude.  Got rid of the friends, girlfriend and joined the Marines.
bzkSIJYnaa	I love Alina, Anya, and Nika.     Alina Ann is definitely my favorite. I also like Anya Valentina.  Also, I think Alina and Nika deserve nicer middle names than Ann, unless Ann is honoring someone.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I like Anna Velentina the best!   Check out mine     http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452|`|OHfZFR31aa	Anya Helene is my fave, followed by Anna Valentina    I don't really like when the first and middle names start with the same letters.

ZbnxGIsnaa	Give it a few more days and then re-test dear.  =)  You definitely sound pregnant.  I REALLY hope you are.|`|nqR7CQ4gaa	Hmmmmm....seems like it would be ok to test now. Maybe you just don't have enough hormone yet???? Good Luck and Lots of Baby Dust!!!
j9axB0YMaa	I also have PCOS. I took clomid for 4 months with no success. Clomid works in your brain attaching itself to the estrogen receptors causing your body to release 3 other hormones which cause your ovaries to produce more eggs and follicles.  Did you know that the PCOS may have caused your miscarriage? Women with PCOS have a 45% chance of miscarriage in the 1st trimester.  I am now 30 weeks pregnant after trying for a year in a half. I conceived without medication. We did however use Pre seed (a lubrication that doesn't damage sperm and helps them swim. www.preseed.com) Hang in there and good luck.

Mx2hzWgTaa	get down to her level, and look her in the eyes and tell her that what she is doing is absolutely NOT ok. With my kids i always carry the Naughty mat [its a little mat that my 2& 1/2 year old and 6 year old sit on when they're bad] [for every year old they are they get a half a minute] Also i take her hand put my hand on it and slap my hand [lightly.. oh and btw it only works with kids around 5& under]. This also gives them the message what they're doing is wrong. When they're done doing their "time" on the naughty mat i make them look me in the eyes and tell me they're sorry and give me a hug. Then i make them fix/clean up/ say sorry for what ever they did. As for school  i would say you need to set up a plan with them. Give the teacher a naughty mat to use too, consistency is very important, don't let her get away with ANYTHING. .. Also super nanny, and nanny 911.. they're gods with the kids!|`|grKtTRYtaa	This is the site for you.  You can ask this ? and get ans. from mothers from your area.  I love it and I'm a grandmother.    It will come to your in box daily:  mamasource.com    Good luck|`|eeaXYyCNaa	You get down to her level and look her in the eye with the most stern look on your face and say " No Mame, that is absolutely not ok."  Make her apologize if the child is still around.  Watch Nanny 911.  That lady is a god sent.  Learned everything from her.  Every where we go we are told our kids are very well behaved.|`|fpGroPpzaa	Whatever happened to discipline? Spank her gently (do not abuse). There have to be consequences besides forcing her to apologize. When she feels the pain she will know not to cause it on others.|`|AA11264399	You spank her, as a form of discipline, not in anger.
SpYS7VYoaa	I'm so sorry. What about his parents, have you told them. I'd think they would want to help you since this is all they have left of their son. If not, or they don't want to help, I think that it is your right either way to keep the baby and not listen to what anyone else says. Since you are so young, you will need help, but theres always places you can go like unwed/underage mothers shelters. My mom went to one of those places until finally her parents cooled off and saw that she was serious and they didn't want to lose their daughter forever, so they supported and helped her (her boyfriend was abusive so she left him before all of this). I know it doesnt sound like a nice thing (a shelter) but if you really want the baby, it is an option. My mom also went to college a year later when she graduated from highschool (all the the right time) she went to NYU (a top school) and went on to recieve her masters degree at Pace with the help of her parents.  She had a job and supported her child and while when she was in school or work, her parents and friends would watch the baby and her job offered child sitting. So theres no reason you have to throw your life away, if your really deternined, I'm sure you can do whatever you set your mind to.   I hope it turns out alright, you've been through alot, maybe your parents will get over their adversion and help you out|`|NZKiSfVOaa	That was the sweetest story I have ever read. I have a tear in my eye. :'(  I hope you keep the baby, no matter what your parents say, it is the only thing left of Keith (r.i.p) and you cant deny a dying man his last wish.   I would keep it no matter what anyone else said.  good luck in the future.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Be realistic - too young to raise a baby    Give the baby up for adoption....baby deserves a good life    Move on..........Keith will always be with you - you don't need a baby to prove that.|`|z3Oed98laa	I think you totally deserve to keep that baby and it was the right thing to do. You sound like you have your heart in the right place. I think you should try explaining this to your parents more...and if they dont accept i dont know wat to tell you. But its ur right to keep ur baby|`|J9fxTGwKaa	That is SOOOOOO sad!!! I feel SO bad for you!!! Because of keith(not your pregnant). Well, If you could find a family in your town or nearby that would take the baby but you could still visit him/her whenever you wanted to and still be a part of its life. If not, then you have to choose shat you wnat more. Do you want to satisfy Keith or do you want to grow up and have an education. No one on here can tell you what to do, you just have to look into your heart and decide which you value and need more.|`|AA12305061	Keith would have wanted you to keep it i'm sure. Even though he's dead, :'[ his family needs to continue on. I say have the baby. And when the baby is older (10-15) tell him this, and that he should be grateful he's alive. Maybe name the baby Keith Jr?|`|iZk9jEBpaa	Keep the baby, this is the last thing you have of your boyfriend. God that's so sad i'm like actually crying, all the best for you and your baby.     =]|`|2f7d753df622c9c42a37e136f0451cb6aa	Any good mother on here is going to tell you to keep the baby.  Once you have a baby you could never ever imagine your life without it.  You are the only one that is going to have to live with knowing the fact that you gave your child away.  Can you live with that?  Do you have any family that will help support you?  what about his family?  Having a child isnt throwing your life away.  Its going down a different path in your life then what was planned.  But life is full of change, new directions etc...  Be strong, not only for yourself but for that lil one you have inside you.   Best of luck.|`|gyhVnBN9aa	wow!  My heart goes out to you. I wouldn't be able to handle this. If you really loved him, then do what your heart and mind tell you to do. To be honest i would do the same and keep the baby, you will have to sacrifice some things but in my opinion keep the baby. keith, maybe wanted to leave you with something you will always remember him by. you got me crying this is so sad, Sorry for your loss and hopefully you will make the right decision. i will keep you and his family in my prayers.|`|7UIoQFKJaa	you should keep the baby
u0mZAPuDaa	This site is absolutely wonderful! You can find any kind of name you are looking for!  http://www.babyhold.com/    I am looking for the 'Ah' names for you.
