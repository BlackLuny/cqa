20090128183331AAKPQZm	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Question about donating blood vs platelets with anemia?	I have moderate anemia and have not been able to donate blood since 1994. I have not attempted to in the last decade or so because my anemia has not improved, its actually gotten progressively worse, so I assumed I would be turned away.      My question is, if I cannot donate blood, can I still donate platelets? I do have some sort of morphology problem (small and misshapen) with my red blood cells but I don't know if that affects my platelets. I'm really not familiar with how it all works.       Also...if the country is in such dire need of blood and the supply is so low, how come they haven't come up with a way to fortify donated blood with iron or other essential nutrients that are missing that keeps people like me from being unable to donate? Just curious since we have so many medical advances.      Thanks if you can help.      And donate if you can :)

20090128191200AAnlQMK	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics Problem. Two car fall off a cliff at different velocity?	Two cars drive off a cliff. The road was completely horizontal until it ended (launching the cars off the cliff with an initail velocity in the horizontal direction). Car A was driving at 80 m/s, and Car B was driving at 20 m/s when they left the cliff. Assume you can ignore wind resistance and friction in this problem.      a) Which car (if any) hits the water at the bottom of the cliff first? Why?      b) Which car (if any) travels further in the air before it hits the water? Why?       C. If the cliff is 12 m high, estimate (to the nearest order of magnitude) how long each car is in the air.       For part A. I think its because due to constant acceleration of gravity, they both hit the water at the same time.   However I'm unsure how to do B and C. Part B, I think the Car A travels faster and would be farther, but how do I explain why.

20090128193748AAZGxw3	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Formula for finding a specific gear ratio?	A friend and I have a project for school, we are racing a motorized car on a straight line that is 20 feet long.  The motor is a little 4v motor that if geared correctly can get down the strip extremely fast (1.36 seconds is the record) The problem is, our physics teacher doesn't know exactly what that gear ratio is.  He said there must be some kind of formula for figuring out the perfect gear ratio to race 20 feet.      He said the car that did the best last year was close to a 1 to 1 ratio geared a little more towards torque.         So i guess my question is, is there a formula for finding the perfect torque/top speed balance so that we can get the fastest time possible

Here is the story.   My friend got a cut on her arm and smelled it. I don't know why. And she said that it smells like rust. I, previously having smelled blood before, implied that it smells like tangerines and copper. We could not come to an agreement on which it smelled like more. So we went around school asking random people which they though was more accurate. Only one person said it smelled like tangerines. And five people said rust. But the other thirteen people we asked said " why are you smelling 'BLOOD' in the first place!? " and then refused to answer either A or B.     We are currently still asking random people and would like to know what the people on yahoo answers think.

20090128202123AAv9qkV	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does Mass Affect Oscillation Rate?	We tested this in science...but somehow it just didn't check out. This was the result of our pendulum lab....but I think it's screwed. xD The oscillation rate seems to drop the heavier the mass. Why is that? Are we doing something wrong? The stuff after parentheses is the time it took to complete five oscialltions. The first three are reaction time, the last the average. The rows represent the marked mass, the cloums the trial number.      Small (14.6 g.) 5.59 s. 5.62 s. 5.53 s. 5.58 s.   Medium (32.3 g.) 5.50 s. 5.60 s. 5.56 s. 5.55 s.   Large (57.3 g.) 5.47 s. 5.12 s. 5.43 s. 5.34 s.       I need an answer asap, please. I'm terribly confused. xD
20090128200059AAEPAnU	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Do we see because of absorbed and then spat out photons?	Is the reason we see certain things as a certain color because their molecules 'accept' photons of certain energies and then shoot them back out at us in every which direction?  Something to do with the object's spectra, rather than actually reflecting light back?   Second, do our eyes pick up colors and light intensity based on the energy of the photons they receive (like pixels?), or the wavelength, or what?  Similar to radio stations -- do they pick up a signal based on photon energy or by actual wavelength/frequency of the electromagnetic radiation?
20090128200559AApGT9r	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	What changes do I need to make to stabilize a crystal oscillator circuit built with a 74AHCU04?	I've built a crystal oscillator circuit according to someone else's design.  I have it running at 16.9344 MHz (or am trying to, anyway).  The circuit calls for a 10 Meg resistor in parallel with the crystal and one inverter on a 74HCU04 chip, with a 33pF capacitor tied from each side to ground.        All that I could get was an AHCU as opposed to the HCU, and I cannot for the life of me get a stable waveform out of the oscillator.  I'm getting pulses that are 42 and 83 nanoseconds long.        The circuit is laid out such that there is virtually no possibility of stray capacitance.  I've tried replacing the crystal, and I've also tried adding a third drive-limiting resistor, as suggested by a few other sources.  Additionally, one source mentioned that for high frequencies such as the one I'm working with, the drive resistor should be replaced with a 33 pF capacitor, which I tried.      I can't get a clean square wave and I'm pulling my hair out here!  Is there something I'm not accounting for with the AHCU?      Sure hope someone can shed some light on this for me.

20090128202635AAFL7Fh	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Why isn't my electric motor generating a charge when i manually turn the shaft?	I recently purchased a motor from BaneBots (MS-16574-050) for use in an upcoming science fair. The motor is to be used to generate electricity in my project. This specific motor was chosen because it had a gear box attachment with a ratio of 574:1, which is perfect for my project.      When I try to generate electricity with this motor and gear box, it doesn't work. With the gear box on, the digital multimeter reads an insignificant charge when i spin the shaft. Without the gear box, the multimeter reads the expected 6 volts. The motor functions fine when attached to a 6 volt battery, even with the gear box on. At first, it felt like the gears were slipping when i turned the shaft by hand, but that clicking noise and feeling gradually faded with more attempts to generate a charge. There is no obvious damage to the gears in the gear box.      This is a very confusing problem, any help is greatly appreciated.

20090128192312AAHTqYz	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Why won't the car make it?	A car is behind a truck going 25 m/s^2 on the highway. The car's driver looks for an opportunity to pass, guessing that his car can accelerate at 1.0 m/s^2. He gauges that he has to cover the 20-m length of the truck, plus 10 m clear room at the rear of the truck and 10 m more at the front of it. In the oncoming lane, he sees a car approaching, probably also traveling at 25 m/s^2. He estimates that the car is about 400 m away.    Q1. Should he attempt the pass?  A1. No    Q2. Give details, explain why not:  A2. ?

I've been having a pre-employment health screening. In addition to drug urine and tb test, I had two I did not understand. First one was a clear plastic "helmet" placed over my head, and an aerosol sprayed through a small hole by my mouth, at which time I was instructed to breathe through my mouth until I could taste the aerosol. THEN a special tight ventilating mask was placed over my nose and mouth, the plastic "helmet" put back on, and the tech again sprayed the aerosol, but of course I couldn't taste it.  What the heck was that all about?      He explained that the mask had something to do with the fact that I was going to be exposed to airborne viruses.      Then he made me read a paragraph about rainbows When I asked him what that was about, he said that the paragraph contained words that emcompassed all of the positions of the mouth.      What the heck were these tests?  I am utterly clueless about the helmet and spray thing. I am guessing the reading could have been some kind of neurological test.  But who knows.      If someone out there knows what these tests were for, I would love to know.

20090128185427AAhO4mS	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics help please........it would be very appreciated!?	A physics professor did daredevil stunts in his spare time. His last stunt was an attempt to jump across a river on a motorcycle. The takeoff ramp was inclined at 53 degrees the river was 40.0 meters wide, and the far bank was 15.0 meter lower than the top of the ramp. The river itself was 100 meters below the ramp. You can ignore air resistance.      1. What should his speed have been at the top of the ramp to have just made it to the edge of the far bank?      the answer is v=17.8 meters/second................i just dont know how to get to it      2. If his speed was only half the value found in A, where did he land?      the answer is L=28.4 meters................same thing i dont know which equation to use            thanks for the help, i really appreciate it :)

I love tree houses, so does my husband, and we plan to some day build a really nice one, not like one that you completely live in, but maybe a living or dinning area, We don't have the tree yet. The tree house plans will probably effect what house we eventually buy. I need to know what we are looking for so I need some answers to these questions.   1, Living in an area with moderate winds and yearly ice storms i'm worried about the weight on the tree. Is it acceptable to use posts and ground support to help hold up the structure? Should I forgo any bolting to the tree and use only ground support to allow for wind movement? (the structure would still be partially in the tree, but not rested on it)   2, in my area any building wired for electricity must be inspected by a county official, would this still be necessary if my tree house ran only on self generated solar power?   3, could i use mostly recycled materials to save on cost and be more environmentally conscious.   4, what trees are best for a tree house that I plan to be about 10-15 feet up.   5, what should I avoid in order to help the health of a tree, how much movement room. (wind)  if any bolting is safe, how to keep it minimal and safe for tree. cables?  can a bolt run through a tree (I"m guessing not)       I know that it's hair brained and away off considering current economic conditions, but any thoughts, knowledge and opinions would be appreciated, and if entertaining, enjoyed.   thanks!

20090128200252AAJ0QqI	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Athiesm 100% disproven?	The mathematical probability is what makes the imaginative ideas of metaphysics ("scientific" atheism) seem possible. no matter how untrue something is, as long an a philosophy is imagined that makes an event seem even .0000000001% possible, it is not true or untrue. So metaphysics and probability when used together are a dangerous combination that form the foundation of all atheistic beliefs which are for the sole intention of pointing away from truth. And there we have it. Any atheistic belief is unravelled by removing all statements based on metaphysics and probability. With these truths layed out, given that atheism is believed by many to be an absolute statement using the science to say "God is not real and here is why", it should be rephrased "God is not real, and here is why they believe why" which provides a much better way of saying " we scientists have no truth, just philosophies"

20090128202837AABfcYg	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Question about 2012 and The Galactic Plane?	I'm sure some of you know that 2012 has been prophesized by the Mayans to be the end of the world because that's the date their calendar ends (they have been right before, they guessed the day Cortez would arrive). I heard a bunch of apocalyptic theories that the world will end in 2012 but the one that really convinces me is the Galactic Plane, which is basically saying that in 2012, our solar system will cross through the center and we will probably hit something, thus destroying the Earth.       Can someone explain to me what the Galactic Plane is and how it's tied to the "end of the world" because I only know a tiny bit. Also, please nobody post anything useless like "dude the world wont end" or "idk lol." I'm not sure if I believe the world will end or not, but can somebody simply explain the Galactic Plane Collision theory in more detail to me?

Whenever i put on my mood ring after holding the rock, it turns pure black, and when i give it to someone who hasn't held the rock, it turns blue,purple, or any other color besides black. Even when i give it to someone else who held the rock it turns black too!   It makes everyone feel something different, like itchyness, numbness, and like their finger tips are frozen.   The thing is, is that i don't tell them that the rock does that to test it and see if it's actually true and not all in the head... and everyone who i didn't tell felt it!   The rock is really smooth, and is brown with streaks of black.   It is heavy, and has sharp edges.   Could this be worth a lot of money?   how much are rare meteorites worth?      how much do you think it would be if i happened to discover a new kind of chemical?   I'm being completely seriously and not exaggerating at ALL.   Please help! thanks!

A formal region is an area in which a certain characteristic is found throughout the area. A state or country is an example of a formal region (called political regions) because everyone living there follows the same laws and is under the same government.      A functional region is an area that has a focal point around which the area centralizes itself. For example, a large metropolitan area is a central hub that may influence people, goods, and services for hundreds of miles away. Another functional region is a school district around which the community bases its activities, like Friday night football games.
