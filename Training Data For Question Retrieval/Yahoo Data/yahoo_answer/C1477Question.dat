20090220073628AAePbUD	Society & Culture;Languages	Do lawyers need a standard accent such as the Oxford one?	Do accents really matter if a lawyer manages to express what is in his mind clearly in clear terms in their original accent?      I believe there have to be lawyers in every different part of the UK. The trouble is that Britons coming from different part of the UK should have different accents, among which some might be considered bad. Some might say Scottish accent is not a good one. Some other might say cockney accent sometimes is unintelligible even to native speakers. Do lawyers need a so-called standard accent? If they don't need any, will a standard accent such as the Oxford one do any good?

20090220074248AAtuNGy	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	A question for gay people?	This is something I've wondered for a long time.  If a man likes men, why would he go for the feminine type?  It seems to me that if a man likes men rather than women, the very thing that would compel him to choose the masculine gender would cause him to prefer a manly man rather than one that has feminine mannerisms and/or appearance.        And the same goes for lesbians.  I know there are many lesbians who are very feminine, but I'm referring to the butch types and the women who love them.  If you're attracted to a woman that is unusually masculine, why do you like women at all rather than men?

20090220074329AA4FubY	Society & Culture;Languages	I hate public speaking, can anyone give me some advice, PLEASE!?!!  D:?	I hate public speaking or any form of open discussion in large groups.  I've been out of school for 3 years and am about to start uni - there's only one thing that's holding me back: my fear of public speaking.      Whether it's a class discussion or an oral presentation, it makes me feel really anxious.  I will literally tremble in fear just having to answer a simple question when asked to in front of a class.  My palms go sweaty, my legs turn to jelly, my heart feels like it's beating out of my chest at 100/mph, my throat goes dry, my voice sounds different to me, my brain turns to mush and I find it really hard to string words together to form a sentence...so basically, I turn retarded.  D:   I'm really sick of being asked a question, which I know the answers to, but am in such a distressed/disorientated state that I can't answer it, thus making me look like a complete idiot.      I've dropped out of classes before to avoid doing speeches or class discussions, however, I know if I want to finish my degree it is inevitable that I will have to encounter these things.  I want some advice from people who have been through what I'm going through so I can make an effort to lessen my fear of public speaking!  Can anyone help me, please??!

20090220074812AAfrKWB	Society & Culture;Languages	Is it right in English this article?Thanksgiving Day?	The origin of the Thanksgiving holiday (Thanksgiving Day) dates back to the Pilgrim Fathers who, after a year of residence in the New World, celebrated this holiday, according to tradition, eating turkey together with Americans who had helped to survive and adapt. In fact, the first winter was for the group of people from Europe, particularly hard, hard and difficult. Only with the help of the Indians with what has come down to us through traditions, legends and historical records, appear to have shared with the new visitors' most of their stores and they have helped to shelter from the cold and to pass the winter. Only with the help and cooperation of the Indians, then, the Pilgrim Fathers, who fled from England to live in another state and full religious freedom, found that people of India who saved their lives.                    The exact date of when it was celebrated by the Pilgrim Fathers and the Indians to celebrate a year of residence, it is absolutely uncertain. Only in 1940 the then President Roosevelt fixed as the date for this national celebration on the last Thursday of November. Americans will not ever forget to celebrate this holiday, wherever they are. It is an opportunity to gather family and friends, to smooth controversy, to put aside grudges and enmities to spend a day together in joy. And the roast turkey is one of the inevitable in this celebration, along with other dishes from the kitchen.                    Thanksgiving for all meet and try to reconcile. E 'una festa predominantly families, but there also some meetings and lunches with groups of friends, who may not be seen for a long time. An invitation to eat turkey on Thanksgiving is also an excellent opportunity for someone to reciprocate is owed or to thank someone who has done us a favor ...      what is wrong? Can you correct me? thank you so much, 10 points sure !!! thank you again...:D

The barrage roars and lifts. Then, clumsily bowed   With bombs and guns and shovels and battle-gear,   Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.   Lines of grey, muttering faces, masked with fear,   They leave their trenches, going over the top,   While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists,   And hope, with furtive eyes and grappling fists,   Flounders in mud. O Jesu, make it stop!      Thanks a lot - any ideas appreciated

20090203130102AA9YGwA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Am I the only black person offended by black history month?	After everything we have been through, why are we still putting so much emphasis on color? Didn't Martin Luther King Jr have a dream that color would no longer be an issue? It seems to me that we are keeping his dream from coming true by focusing on skin color in every situation. Is it really necessary to mention each time someone is the first black person to fill a certain position or perform a certain task? How does them being black have anything to do with it? Unless it's the first black couple to have a completely white baby, I really don't see why their skin color should matter?      I have a dream that one day we can have a history month without the word black in there or anything else to indicate color of skin. I have a dream that we as humans will all be united and join hands as equals. I have a dream that one day a man will accomplish a great task and be known for his accomplishment alone and not his skin color having anything to do with it.

20090203130118AAWW0gb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists/Nonbelievers When it comes to God do you influence your childrens beliefs?	A.  If you do then you are doing the exact same thing you Accuse Christians for.  So what would be the difference?   B.  If you claim you don't then how do you react or answer when your child ask if there is a God?        On here many if not all when answering that question say God does not exist, he is a fairytale, myth, Christians are murderers, delusional, etc etc etc   So, do you tell your kids that when they ask?  And if not then why do you tell other kids that?        Second part:   I asked a question a few days ago, " Does atheists like anyone other then themselves"  Most all replied they love their spouse and kids.        Adults/spouses okay-we can accept each others differences.     But the kids-  Surely all kids who believe in God would have asked their father/mother why they are not going to church or don't believe as they know the consequences, right.    So naturally, this child would be in fear of what the outcome is for their father/mother.   So my question is this-I understand why you don't love God but don't you love your kids enough to do it for them?          I know many of you think I am trying to insult atheists all the time.  That is Not my intention.   I am just asking question from the answers that you all give.

20090203125401AALWyQq	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Sell-out for Interracial Dating?	I need help understanding this, if I happen to fall for a white or hispanic man I am a sellout? Despite the face that I fell in love with him not his ethnicity. I do not understand.....Why are people saying that when they see IR couples they know that there are doing it out of self hate? Do you speak to every IR couple and they plainly tell you "i hate my race that why I date outside my race". I have never been called a sellout because I was dating someone who wasn't black. Where does this sell out nonsense come from? Don't get me wrong some people do date outside their race because they believe horrible stereotypes or they had a bad experience with ONE person and decided to denounce the entire race thinking another would be "better" but that is a small percentage compared to the whole. Its 2009 and if i date someone who is not black why should you care?      Peace

Is clothing ALWAYS necessary, or just a habit?      Think about it: clothes trap a lot of oils, and continually hiding your body makes you much more self conscious whenever you get naked. Every nudist has said it makes them feel more comfortable about their bodies. Maybe we shouldn't be naked for everything, like buisness meetings and more serious events, but can't we be naked more in casual situations?

But it doesn't make me bad.      It's partially funny because of the irony related to the incident. Every girl I know loves Chris Brown... But I bet they wouldn't love fists flying at them from multiple directions.      I never really liked her. Her music p!!!!sssed me offfffff.

The New Book   Jeremias Chapter 36: 27-32      And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying: Take thee again another volume, and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of Juda hath burnt. And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou  written therein, and said: The king of Babylon shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night. And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they have not heard.   And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch the son of Nerias the scribe, who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt in the fire; and there were words added besides many more words than had been before.

20090220082031AADCsZm	Society & Culture;Languages	Why do English language writers say "body"?	I've noticed this all my life. Whenever someone falls from a great height, writers always treat the victim as dead even before he or she hits the ground.       Here's an example:      "Then to the horrified watchers below there appeared the figure of their hero in a headlong leap from the cockpit of the burning aircraft! Lufbery had preferred a leap to certain death rather than endure the slow torture of burning to a crisp. His body fell in the garden of a peasant woman's house in a little town just north of Nancy."    http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/luf.h...       Note that not Lufbery, but his "body" fell.      This strange usage isn't limited to journalists (the above example wasn't from a journalist), though they seem to be the main culprits. How did this usage originate? Is this somehow supposed to be a matter of respect for the deceased or his family? Do writers in other languages do the same?
20090220090131AAjScGB	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Ghost in my bedroom....?	Last night I was sat up in bed reading and I looked up for a second and I saw a pale, translucent woman. I just looked at her. She was staring behind my head (the wall over my bed) and then she just disappeared. She seemed pretty young too, quite flat shape.      My house is about 51 years old, so is it possible that it's haunted? Then again, me and my parents live in an old town (Going back to 1500's)      I was reading Pride and Prejudice at the time so I doubt that it was a figment of my imagination.      I think I've seen this ghost before when I was younger. She was sat on my chair and stared out of the window and looked like she was muttering to herself.      Creepy...

20090220083329AAFUFZK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question about Mormon tithing?	When I was a member, I found it odd that of all the churches, the LDS one was the main one that actually requires you to pay it.  If you look at it in a way, does it mean it costs you to have to go to the temple?  They won't let you go if you haven't paid a full tithe, even those that don't really have the means to.  I was a student, still am actually, but after rent and gas I had only enough money left to get food to live on.  My bishop called me in, telling me I needed to pay, it didn't matter to him that I had no way of doing it.  I told him I felt it was more important for me to actually have food to eat, not give the money to him to where I may not eat for the month.  The one month I actually tried and had to eat very little, I actually got very sick and ended up in the hospital, putting me further behind in the money department.  So I told him I would not pay it, that I needed the money I had for housing, gas so I could get to school and work, and food to live on.  Why is the church, who makes billions of dollars from tithing, why were they so worried about my little portion, especially when I couldn't pay it?  Why is it a requirement when to me it seems like a way to get money from the members and make you buy your way into heaven?

It's just a small country with a small population in the middle East. But the place is the focus of the worlds problems.      Why do so many Christians still think that the Jews are Gods people and Israel is the holy land?       Isn't that all a thing of the past since Jesus came and replaced the 10 commandment with the law of love.       I'm not anti-anyone, but I think the US's support for Israel is only bringing trouble.  Can't the Israelis take care of themselves, like everyone else? You can't tell me that the US isn't supporting the Israeli military machine.

People the world over believe in a supernatural world populated by gods who perform miracles, ghosts who act as intermediaries between the gods and man, and saints who have been revered as holy men.  Despite the lack of evidence to prove that theses beings exist, people still continue to worship these supernatural entities.  WHY???

I was raped about 6 years ago, I always thought i was attracted to woman but never dated a woman until after my attack. I don't think me being raped has anything to do with my sexual orientation, but yet whenever i tell someone my story they automatically think they've 'solved' my 'problem' of being gay...   Do you think that being raped has an impact on sexual orientation?

20090220090536AA7nTBs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	As a parent what are your expectations from your child?	Posting a parenting related question here...but read on...religion does come up.....      I was brought up in a very sheltered environment and have always been an obedient and studious child. I did good in school. college etc and now am successfully employed. So far I was the epitome if proper child to my parents ...as they kept telling me how proud they are of me.      I moved away from home...fell in love and got married to a guy I had know for 4 years. He is also educated, responsible caring loving...all!. he was raised in a different religion. The 4 years I knew him...I questioned my beliefs etc...to make sure what I felt and if I was ready to commit, and I was.      Ever since the day I told my parents I wanted to marry him...their attitude towards me changed completely. They told me that marrying him was the biggest mistake I could make...and how they never expected me to do so...and how difficult it would be for them to accept this.      We got married anyways and every time I talk to my Mom or Dad they will say something to put my husband down. Its so disheartening to see this. My husband thinks that they just need more time and when they see how happy we are they will come to terms with it.      Sometimes I feel that I was too harsh on them...that I was too selfish . I love them but I don't fell i did anything wrong.      So as a parent what are your expectations from your child...if you had been in my parents place would you feel the same way too?      Thanks for reading...

20090220093709AABwO1m	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Keeping a secret from everyone :(?	I am not going to say my exact situation because I'm too much of a coward to share it (even if you are all strangers) I will sort of say because this is the only opportunity I will get to say without anyone I know seeing it. For the past couple of years, I have been keeping a pretty big secret about myself which I can't get the strength inside to tell anyone. Not even my closest friends. Because I'd be scared I'd lose people, and they would probably be very surprised to find out. I know it is not bad. But some people would think so. Maybe one day I will get to the point where I have to tell people because it gets too much. But I'm only 15, so it's tricky at the moment. Many people would dislike me anyway, and I'd lose so many people probably. I just don't know what to do. I feel like there is constantly something inside me which I just can't let out. And for the time being, I feel separated from everyone. And I can't be myself. I just don't know what i can do. There probably isn't a solution to make this better, except for telling people. But telling people is my biggest fear. And I would for some reason feel embarrassed. I know somebody who would understand. But I barely know them. This is the person who made me realise, when we used to go to a club a couple of years ago we used to hang around with eachother. I get on with this person, but we are not close friends and we barely talk. I could if I wanted over msn, and this person has a truth box on myspace which I am tempted to put my feelings in. But I'm worried in case there is a way they can find out that I wrote it. I feel like a coward, and that I should share it. But I'd lose too much. To be honest I know know how this will help, but I just needed to share it. If somehow anyone can give me a little advice, thank you :/

They say things like quiet people are rude, lack self-confidence and/or have low self-esteem. It is so stupid for people to criticize others that are different from them.

20090220083728AA3kR6o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jesus said, you shall know the tree by its fruit.?	Science, including the Theory of Evolution enabled great strides in human development.      Evolutionary theory has been put to practical use in several areas (Futuyma 1995; Bull and Wichman 2001). For example:          * Bioinformatics, a multi-billion-dollar industry, consists largely of the comparison of genetic sequences. Descent with modification is one of its most basic assumptions.       * Diseases and pests evolve resistance to the drugs and pesticides we use against them. Evolutionary theory is used in the field of resistance management in both medicine and agriculture (Bull and Wichman 2001).       * Evolutionary theory is used to manage fisheries for greater yields (Conover and Munch 2002).       * Artificial selection has been used since prehistory, but it has become much more efficient with the addition of quantitative trait locus mapping.       * Knowledge of the evolution of parasite virulence in human populations can help guide public health policy (Galvani 2003).       * Sex allocation theory, based on evolution theory, was used to predict conditions under which the highly endangered kakapo bird would produce more female offspring, which retrieved it from the brink of extinction (Sutherland 2002).       Phylogenetic analysis, which uses the evolutionary principle of common descent, has proven its usefulness:          * Tracing genes of known function and comparing how they are related to unknown genes helps one to predict unknown gene function, which is foundational for drug discovery (Branca 2002; Eisen and Wu 2002; Searls 2003).       * Phylogenetic analysis is a standard part of epidemiology, since it allows the identification of disease reservoirs and sometimes the tracking of step-by-step transmission of disease. For example, phylogenetic analysis confirmed that a Florida dentist was infecting his patients with HIV, that HIV-1 and HIV-2 were transmitted to humans from chimpanzees and mangabey monkeys in the twentieth century, and, when polio was being eradicated from the Americas, that new cases were not coming from hidden reservoirs (Bull and Wichman 2001). It was used in 2002 to help convict a man of intentionally infecting someone with HIV (Vogel 1998). The same principle can be used to trace the source of bioweapons (Cummings and Relman 2002).       * Phylogenetic analysis to track the diversity of a pathogen can be used to select an appropriate vaccine for a particular region (Gaschen et al. 2002).       * Ribotyping is a technique for identifying an organism or at least finding its closest known relative by mapping its ribosomal RNA onto the tree of life. It can be used even when the organisms cannot be cultured or recognized by other methods. Ribotyping and other genotyping methods have been used to find previously unknown infectious agents of human disease (Bull and Wichman 2001; Relman 1999).       * Phylogenetic analysis helps in determining protein folds, since proteins diverging from a common ancestor tend to conserve their folds (Benner 2001).       Directed evolution allows the "breeding" of molecules or molecular pathways to create or enhance products, including:          * enzymes (Arnold 2001)       * pigments (Arnold 2001)       * antibiotics       * flavors       * biopolymers       * bacterial strains to decompose hazardous materials.       The evolutionary principles of natural selection, variation, and recombination are the basis for genetic algorithms, an engineering technique that has many practical applications, including aerospace engineering, architecture, astrophysics, data mining, drug discovery and design, electrical engineering, finance, geophysics, materials engineering, military strategy, pattern recognition, robotics, scheduling, and systems engineering (Marczyk 2004).       Clearly this shows that the Theory of Evolution yields good fruit, and therefore following Jesus' teachings, the Theory of Evolution itself is good.    Why do fundamentalists not obey Jesus and accept the Theory of Evolution?

20090220085157AA2O5Xy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Help me?! I think there's a spirit?!?	Ok, I didn't know where else to put this question. Amanda, Hannah, Danielle, Kris, and I were at my friend Christina's house. Christina wanted to play the ouija board. So we did. We asked if there was a spirit there, it pointed to yes. We asked if it was a boy, it pointed to yes. We asked what his name started with, it pointed to C. I asked if his name was Chris, and it pointed to yes. We asked when he died, he said, 1985, and we asked how old he was, he said 18. So then, someone calls Christina's cell phone, it was a restricted number. We heard breathing. Someone called Amanda's phone, and we heard, "I died in a car accident." We began to get freaked out, we knew it was Chris. Then he called my phone, and we heard a piano playing. He called Hannah, and he was playing piano. He called every one of us, except Kris, because he didn't have a cell phone. Then, he called Amanda's phone, she said to me, "Beth, he wants you." And then I took the phone, and Chris was like, "Where's Beth?!" and then he hung up. We thought Beth was his girlfriend. So I was like, "But I'm only 13!" Then we asked if Beth was his daughter. It pointed to Yes. We asked how old she is, he said 13. We started to get freaked out even more. He kept calling us saying, "Where's Beth?!". Then, I had to go home. He called me again in the car, and I was like, "I'm sorry, I have to go." My dad was like, "Who was that?" I was like, "I didn't know." And he was like, "Well, then don't answer it!" Then he called again. I had to press Ignore. I prayed that Chris's soul would be put to rest, and that he would stop contacting us. I signed on AIM on my phone. My friend Amanda IM'ed me saying, "were's beth!!!!!" (exact spelling). I thought she was trying to scare me, but she said she wasn't on that night, and my phone signed me off of AIM. Then, Christina tells me someone with the sn unknown1985 IM'ed her asking for me. Chris has stopped calling me, but I don't know if he will continue. He keeps calling Christina. What should we do? Should we see a priest?

20090220090800AAXVI2S	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My Girlfriend and a another woman?	Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over 6 months.  We are happy and having great sex.  We watch porn (lesbian and straight) and talk during sex about other woman.  First I need to give background...I am my gf first real male relationship.  She has dated guys but nothing serious.  She has had a relationships with another woman during high school.  She has not been with another woman since high school which is around 4 years ago.  She was in that one relationship with the female for about a year.  She tells me it was just a phase and that she is striaght and she wants to be with me.  So of course I asked if she would be into a threesome.  She told me that she was unsure.  So background on the another person, this would be the other girl I want to include.  She works with the both of us and is bi-sexual.  She has a boyfriend (she does not want him included in the act).  She also has had relationships with other woman.  So I thought it would be a good fit to ask her to join us.  My gf said she would have to see and the other girl said yes right away.  After a few days of talking to the both of them they both state they would feel more comfortable with just the two of them for the first time.  My gf said she is not looking for a relationship except with me and the other girl just wants sex with my gf not me.  Which is just fine with the two of us.  I just want to watch my gf and this girl and have sex with my gf.  I am fine with them doing things alone for the first time but my question is I am concerned that they will continue to do things either behind my back or without me all the time.  Should I just cancel the whole thing or let the first time happen without me and go from there.  We have shared pictures and videos and everyone is set.  I am just having reservations about them two alone.  I guess I shouldn't complain if this is kind of what I wanted from the start.  I just want to make sure I'm included.      Were do I go from here?

20090220100402AAne5ku	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	THe differences between homosexuality and every other sin...?	I was contemplating why homosexuality is such a huge issue compared with other sins, then I figured it out: Homosexuality is the only sin that has absolutely 0 impact on your life.      Fornication: say what you want, but there is something special about saving yourself for marriage. Whether you think this is positive or negative or not, you must admit, it has a huge impact on how you live your life.      Adultery: cheating on someone is bad.      Stealing, murdering, not honoring your parents, greed, etc. All speek for themselves.      Heck, even the OT laws made sense. Tribe size was important, so all the laws were to keep people fertile and healthy.         However, homosexuality is the only "sin" that does not negatively impact someone's life in the least. One can be a Homosexual Christian who goes to mass every week, saves himself for marriage (assuming he can get married), then has a loving, lifelong monogamous relationship. He is free to follow every single one of God's commandments.      So why is homosexuality so different? Well, when you read a little closer, you can see. Jesus fulfilled the OT laws, so you can reject those, but the ones in the New Testamtnt seem to be strange, too. Seems they are probably a mistranslation:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_a...    (Sorry about the Wikipedia reference, but this information is common knowledge for scholars, and it DOES sum it up rather nicely)         So, homosexuality is different from every other sin, and could be in the Bible as a mistranslation...Could it be that maybe it is not a sin after all?
20090220095642AABcIyP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why Should I Trust God, After What Happened To Lucifer?	Christians often cite Ezekiel 28 as a description of Lucifer before he fell.      In this description Lucifer was the “cherub” that covered God’s glory.  He had built-in musical instruments that expressed the very glory of God.      If God created Lucifer, and God created you and me and everybody else.      And when God created Lucifer, I’m sure that Lucifer trusted God to some extent.      Lucifer was created with free-will.      The Bible says that sin was “found” in him – and immediately Lucifer was cast down and every imaginable horror and indignity was brought upon him.      Not only this, but 1/3 of the angels in Heaven apparently thought this was such an injustice that they joined Lucifer.        Every Heavenly creature was close to God – with Lucifer being the closest.      They saw God in a way that humans do not see God.  It was not through a ‘glass darkly’ rather more like face to face.      If GOD is so wonderful, fulfilling, completing, secure, safe, trustworthy, loving, then why?      What did Lucifer and 1/3 of the angels in Heaven see that made them CHOOSE something else?      GOD obviously made them.  God knew what the challenges of free-will would present.      “POOF!” all these Heavenly creatures suddenly appeared in Heaven.  They had jobs, like, Lucifer did, making music, etc…  I’m sure every job had something to do with praising God.      So God created beings, with Lucifer as an example, for the express purpose of GLORIFYING HIMSELF.      But something went wrong, didn’t it?  Suddenly, it became rather ridiculous doing this 24/7.  Because GOD put into these creatures this thing called FREE-WILL – (AND most important, that even though they had free will, they HAD to use it to PRAISE and WORSHIP GOD).      And the same is true today.  We were created - by God - with free-will also.  BUT the catch is, that we MUST use it the way GOD wants us to use it.      If free-will is the hallmark of God’s exemplary love for His creation, why is it that it is the sole instrument for every imaginable evil?  When God created free-will, did He not know all of the evil that would be spawned as a result?      If GOD merely demands eternal PRAISE and WORSHIP, why did He not simply create robots?  That way, GOD’s exemplary LOVE would not have caused so much suffering?      Is is not true that if you love something, you set it free?  Was Lucifer ever truly loved?  Was Lucifer set free, when Lucifer decided to use his free-will for something other than ceaseless praise of God?      It is my Biblical opinion that Lucifer and all the angels who used their free-will were not loved, or set free, but merely enslaved. (according to the Biblical narrative).      A man who is set free is nothing but a freed man – a dog, dragging a piece of chain behind him.      Can you explain this?

20090220100922AA2U6Z3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	? In your opinion what attributes qualify or disqualify a writing as being "Divinely Inspired?"?	I am not asking for a sermon or your personal religious beliefs on the afterlife (though IF you kindly could state religious affiliation, or lack thereof that also would be helpful).       I simply desire your PERSONAL OPINION on the matter. There are no wrong answers.       Upon the presumption that there does exist such a thing what attributes/characteristics would qualify that writing as being "Divinely Inspired." How would you qualify a document as being authentic whereas it concerns Divine Inspiration?      Upon the presumption that such a thing does not exist, what attributes/characteristics would thus disqualify that writing as being "Divinely Inspired."    How would you disqualify a document as being authentic whereas it concerns Divine Inspiration?      This is not meant to be an argument for or against the existence of God or gods, (though i suppose personal spiritual beliefs would play a part in the qualification or disqualifications listed) this is simply a general inquiry as to the methods used by others when qualifying a document in such a fashion.       PLEASE be respectful of the beliefs of others even if you disagree. And, as previously stated there are no wrong answers.      Thanks. xoxo ?
20090220101414AAn0tuI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"Christians, if your son committed first degree murder, would you lock him in your basement and torture him...?	".....every single day for the rest of his life?"      I am a Christian and the following question was asked by an atheist (I do have a question at the end).       Here is my rebuttal to that argument:      I would NOT do that because it would be morally wrong.      If God decides to "torture" people by indirectly sending them to Hell, however, it would be morally justified though for a few reasons:      1) The "torture" is a PUNISHMENT for doing bad things. He recieves NO enjoyment from this and he honestly does not want to do it. This is why he gave us the free gift of Jesus. If someone refuses it they ONLY have themselves to blame.      2) God created us and he has a right to do what he wants because he has INFINITE wisdom and all the facts.      3) God does and should have a different set of morality then we do because his ways and understanding are HIGHER than ours. If I would to do the same exact thing it would NOT be right because it is NOT my place.       Would it be right if I personally sent you to prison if you did something bad?       OF COURSE NOT. I am NOT a JUDGE.       The only judge is God.      Anyway, what is your rebuttal to that atheist quote?      I think it completely ignores the fact that we have different standards of who can do what in our society. ONLY a cop can arrest someone. ONLY a judge can sentence someone. ONLY God can indirectly send someone to Hell.

If you like here is the link to it:::::: http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NJXg9X...    Or you can just read it from here, although the blog makes it look nicer...      A man was having a conversation with Allah one day and said,    ' O Allah , I would like to know what Jannah and Jahannam are like.'       Allah led the man to two doors.       He opened one of the doors and the man looked in.       In the middle of the room was a large round table. In the middle of the table was a large pot of stew, which smelled delicious and made the man's mouth water.       The people sitting around the table were thin and sickly. They appeared to be famished.       They were holding spoons with very long handles, that were strapped to their arms and each found it impossible to reach into the pot of stew and take a spoonful.       But because the handle was longer than their arms, they could not get the spoons back into their mouths.       The man shuddered at the sight of their misery and suffering.       Allah said, 'You have seen Jahannam.'       They went to the next room and opened the door. It was exactly the same as the first one.       There was the large round table with the large pot of stew which made the man's mouth water.       The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons, but here the people were well nourished and plump, laughing and talking. The man said, 'I don't understand..'       It is simple,' said Allah . 'It requires but one skill.       "You see, they have learned to feed each other, while the greedy think only of themselves.'       Subhan-Allah....there is a very important lesson to be learnt here!      ALHUMDUILLAH!      From the One and Only Abdul-Hasib

20090220101851AAL3iwa	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Ladies- If you came home early or unexpected and walked?	in only to find your husband or bf in the house walking around in pantyhose, bra, nightgown or just lingerie of some sort that pretty much would tell you he is a closet cross dresser, I am just wondering (still) about how many of you would be able to accept and be supportive even tho he kept it a secret ? Would you rather he told you when you first got together and if so would that have made a difference in you getting married or dating ? And last - would you stay and try to work it out or would you turn and walk away and leave him ? Keep in mind to that one of the hardest things for a crossdressing male to do is to be able to open up to someone and talk about it, In past situations we have trusted and we have been embarrassed in front of family and friends, struggled most of our life with various stages of depression, considered suicide more than once, (thank God I Never went thru with it) and pretty much struggled to maintain a relationship for fear of rejection again, Some say they want to know up front, then others don't want to know at all, and yet others can accept it but they never want to see it or anything about it, We get comments about being gay because we like the feel of woman's silk panties, or the feel good things women get to wear anytime they want, well I like the feel of them as well, but also for me the feelings of wearing lingerie stuff, bra, pantyhose or nightgown etc. it is a way for me to be able to really relax, and I keep it home and private, So I am just wondering where the ladies are that can accept a guy that also happens to be a cross dresser? and no, not gay either,,

20090220102930AAwe5mg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do prayers actually work?	I am Christo-curious - to coin a phrase - and just wondered how exactly prayers to God (including to Jesus) work. I know that one should say the prayer in one's own head as articulately as possible but what beats me is how the prayer goes from one's head to god. Can anyone explain this to me? Does the prayer need to physically travel between the human brain and heaven (where I believe god lives) or can god somehow tap into one's brain to hear the prayer without it needing to, so to speak, go anywhere? The physicists have been unable to discover a wavelength or whatever along which a prayer can travel. Without being overly facetious this is a legitimate question because - putting aside wild and fanciful notions such as telekinesis (which I think Christians would scoff at) there must be some scientific way prayers work! If not scientific, what?

We have had a roller coaster of a relationship, but we all have problems. I bought her an ring on Monday so that I could ask her to marry me. I was going to ask her on Wednesday night, but on Tuesday night I made the fatal mistake of accusing her of cheating. We have had problems in the past and she thinks I haven't let it go. She told me that she would never marry me and that she didn't want to be with me anymore. I recently lost my job and I have been really insecure about her having to take care of us and me not having anything to offer her anymore. I feel like any body with a job could offer her a better life than I can, so I read that night into something the wrong way and thats what lead to me loosing her. She isn't mad anymore, but maintains that she doesn't want to be with me anymore. We have two children and six years together, but she says that she is tired of the problems and going back and foward . Is there any way I can get her back or should I just take the ring back and let her go. I love her and I don't know if I can live without her.

First time asking a question in this section.        I find girl-on-girl very erotic, especially when there is a guy involved in the situation too.  Is that very common???  Or is it an indication that I'm bi-curious or whatever?        My bf LOVES it that I find that situation hot and he thinks I'm bi-curious and he suggests I have an encounter with another girl on my own, but . . . idk.  In my mind, I find it most hot when it's a 3-some.      What does this say about me???????

I live in New Jersey (Hudson County) and my landlord is selling the house I live in and the new owners will not let me have my dog.  I adopted my dog LuLu 3 years ago after she was abandoned.  She is a pitbull and she is sweet and loving.  I absolutely adore her.  I never imagined myself owning a pitbull but when I saw her at the shelter I knew right away this was the dog I would rescue.  I can not find an apartment that will let me bring her.   Everyone seems to hate pitbulls.  My pitbull is such a sweetheart and I will not abandon her.   People tell me "just bring her back to the shelter".  I can not do that.   Has anyone else experienced this problem???

20070309114702AAXFt1Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are you acting in God's will? (not what you think...)?	Jesus says in Matthew 7 (vs 15-22)       "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.       "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'      Matthew 25:31-40 implies there are those who don't realize they follow Jesus, and those who think they are.

Siempre se ha puesto de manifiesto el bajísimo nivel de lectura que tenemos en México comparado con otros países y explicándose así el pobre nivel de conciencia que tenemos en este país. Por ejemplo, mientras que en EUA el promedio de lectura anual es de 28 libros, el promedio de lectura en el mismo período de tiempo, un a?o, en México es de 0.37. ?No llegamos ni a un libro! En EUA, la lectura se asocia con placer e inteligencia, en México la lectura se asocia con castigo o aburrimiento. Luego queda extremadamente claro el porqué en México hay tanta falta de…, de…, de tantas cosas en nuestro país. Falta entendimiento y todo lo que ello conlleva. Falta capacidad de comprensión, falta apertura mental, falta salir de la oscuridad, falta educación. Si quieres hacer algo tremendamente valioso por ti y como consecuencia por nuestro país.   Para ser sincero, mi promedio es bajo comparado con el de Reino Unido (40 libros por a?o), el mío es sólo de 17.   ?Cuánto lees tú?

20061120125505AAkUYvx	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people always say that cheerleaders are stuck up snobby preps?	Everyone always says how preppy and snobby cheerleaders are. Well I'm a cheerleader and I AM NOT preppy or snobby. I think people think that, because maybe they are jealous that most cheerleaders are good looking, beautiful, and very educated.       I often notice that fat girls don't seem to like cheerleaders. I think because they look up to us, so they are sort of jealous of us too, and plus those type of people are usually from trailer parks, or apartment buildings so I could understand what type of environment they've been raised in to be hateful towards good citizens, also they make be jealous and want money because some cheerleaders have rich families. I'm not rich, but I'm like upper middle class, so almost rich, but not rich, but almost.       So when like people know that cheerleaders are good, why would they wannt keep hating us, even though most people do like cheerleaders, there is that group that hate us and they don't like us, so why?

Hemos sido capaces en estos tiempos y en tiempos pasados, de criticar, perseguir, esclavizar y hasta asesinar sociedades que sienten su religión de un modo distinto al nuestro. La más vil reacción contra miembros de otras religiones se da en estos momentos contra el mundo Islámico; estamos practicando la islamofovia.         Sin embargo cuando hay que utilizar el ejemplo de Jesús el virtuoso, amoroso y piadoso; nos es casi imposible acatar sus fundamentos y ense?anzas. Tantas vidas perdidas por nuestra cobardía.          Nosotros, los ciudadanos comunes en el mundo afines a las ense?anzas de Jesús, nos decimos cristianos sin la más mínima de reflexión, preferimos hacernos de la vista larga frente al atropeyo de diriguentes mundiales que utilizan la excusa de sus preceptos religiosos y su islamofovia para justificar nuestras atrocidades. La verdad es que hemos sido por generaciones milenarias, unos rarísimos cristianos, verguenza de Dios en los preceptos de la religión.      !Viva Jesus?
