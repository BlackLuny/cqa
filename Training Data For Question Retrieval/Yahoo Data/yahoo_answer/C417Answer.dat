It does a great job of pulling the liquid out of the fabric.  If needed apply more baking soda|`|gjs1GXdTaa	Yes it will.

Depending on what the stain is, you probably won't need to use either.  oxyclean and water mixed together works just as well and doesn't create the problem the perioxide does.  if it's a beverage stain, like wine, juice or soda, try wetting the carpet with water, pour regular salt over the stain and then wait until the salt changes color and is dry. VAcum up and repeat as the stain reappears.
fEBOzWeXaa	I hae seen a few ideas on those "do it yourself" shows that looked interesting.  One was to take a door that had unique features or designs and paint it to match what ever you want in your bedroom and nail it to the wall above where your bed would stand.  The other ideas were similar but different items were used. One had fabric blocks that matched the bedding, some were metal tiles mixed with mirror tiles and both looked rather rustic. these were not the kind of headboards attached, obviously but looked interesting anyway.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Some plywood, foam and batting wrap, a nice fabric and some detail work for push in buttons.

The apple is yours as it landed on your property. However,  a court may decide than in the event that you slipped over in your garden was because you lacked "due diligence" when in your garden ie: its your fault.  Also you are legally allowed to cut a branch off a tree belonging to a neighbour that overhangs[ boundry] in to your garden.A court may also decide why you did not do this.   Personally I'd keep overhanging branch - free apples!!
8b208c218ca607538d81a450c309c9bcaa	Use Bait!  I am a exterminator. Get yourself some Advion Roach bait. Place the bait in the corners of cabinets under, the refrigerator, behind the microwave,. Pull open the cabinet drawers and place a couple of dots of the bait on each side of the open drawer. Put a drop at the hinges of the cupboard doors. Place some bait under the kichen or dining room tables and coffe tables. Open your dresser drawers and nite stands and put a few drops of bait there. Treat all cracks and crevices. Pay particular attention to the Kitchen and bath and anywhere you have seen roaches. Do not use any sprays as the spray will make the bait repellent and it won't work. Baits take a few days to work, but after about a week or less you will see a dramatic drop in the roach population. retreat in about 10 -14 days. Once you get the problem under control. Get a bag of the Advion roach bait arena (These are round Plastic Bait Stations) and place one in the back of each cabinet in the kitchen and bath and under the refigerator. Replace the bait arena's every 3 months and you should stay roach free forever.

Ok, maybe you should just use a product that kills them when they try to get out of the walls and in your house, I think there is a kind of paste you can put along the walls.

wj8FNY7Vaa	I believe you answered your own question.  You are at the top of your price range.    What you have to consider is what would it cost you to make the conversion verses what your potential gain might be.  In today's "buyers" market you need to consider your ability to sell your home.   Now if you are going to do almost all of the labor yourself it might be worth it.  But not if you will need to sell the property in a hurry.  It might be worth it for your own enjoyment, but i highly doubt it would make for a good capital investment.|`|H2KLyDM0aa	ask george bush   u voited 4 him|`|2kuD6Domaa	Probably not the right time in the market to try to add lots of value that you can't recoup.  You are probably better off leaving well enough alone.  You might consider doing something low cost but unique with your extra room on top of the detached garage.  Game room or office for example.|`|ZknaSxX7aa	Considering the current economic climate, you would probably be better off leaving things as they are; house prices are falling like rain, and you may lose your investment plus scare away potential buyers.

aJGAXYUIaa	with paint|`|35973b1d85a1698fa71f2f18d6c99d7caa	I've been wondering the same thing myself.  I've been dying to try a suggestion I received, so I'll pass is on to you, hope it helps.    I'm assuming that they are already in the house, so to paint the inside, go to your local craft store and buy glass paint, comes in every color!    I wanted to paint the inside of the glass, so they told me to get a small ceramic drill bit and make a hole in the glass.  Then put the glass paint inside and swirl around to get the desired effect.
fvre0o9laa	You'll probably want a zigzag capable machine in order to retain the stretch of the knit, and at that price point, you're in the garage sale territory.      http://www.cet.com/~pennys/faq/smfaq.htm    What I want for beginners in sewing:    - a machine that doesn't scare you  - a machine that isn't balky (cheap new machines are often very    balky or need adjustments often and are rarely repairable --    just too frustrating to learn on!)  - very good straight stitch  - good zigzag (4-5 mm is fine, more than that is gravy)  - a method of making buttonholes that makes sense to you  - adjustable presser foot pressure (which helps some fabric    handling issues)  - accessory presser feet that don't cost an arm and a leg    (machines that use a "short shank foot" typically handle    generic presser feet pretty well.  Some brands of machines use    proprietary or very expensive presser feet)    If the budget stretches far enough:    - blindhem and stretch blindhem stitches  - triple zigzag (nice for elastic applications)  - a couple of decorative stitches (you won't use them nearly as    much as you think)  - electronic machine because of the needle position control and    because the stepper motors give you full "punching force" at    slow sewing speeds -- mechanical machines often will stall at    slow speeds.      Please go to the best sewing machine dealers around and ask them  to show you some machines in your price range, *especially* used  machines you can afford. You'll get a far better machine buying  used than new, and a good dealer is worth their weight in sewing  machine needles when you get a machine problem -- often they can  talk you through the problem over the phone. While you're trying  things out, try a couple of machines (sewing only, not combo  sewing-embroidery) over your price limit, just so you can see  what the difference in stitch quality and ease of use might be.  You may find you want to go for the used Cadillac. Or you might  want the new basic Chevy. Might as well try both out.    Suggested reading: John Giordano's The Sewing Machine Book  (especially for used machines), Carol Ahles' Fine Machine Sewing  (especially the first and last few chapters) and Gale Grigg  Hazen's Owner's Guide to Sewing Machines, Sergers and Knitting  Machines. All of these are likely to be available at your public  library.    Used brands I'd particularly look for: Elna, Bernina,  Viking/Husqvarna, Pfaff, Singer (pre 1970), Juki, Toyota    New "bargain brand" I'd probably pick, if new was my choice:  Janome (who also does Kenmore).|`|pPc2kZfwaa	ur hands|`|aa2131f0b0d93de418b8d02cace49bafaa	I have a Brother.

l1m0mDPaaa	Sunflower will start growing in 5 days. You will have a small, maybe very small, seedling. You could also try soybean or alfalfa seeds. They sprout fast.   For whatever seed you choose, soak the seed overnight in lukewarm water, in  a glass jar/or other container. Just about an inch of water over the seeds. Take a rubberband and secure a papertowel over the top of your container. b/c the lid should not be air tight. In the morning, drain off the water. Put the seeds in a wet (but not soaked) paper towel. Make a 'row' (or a few rows) with the seeds and roll the seeds up in the paper towel. Put a rubber band at each end of the papertowel to make sure the seeds dont roll out. Put the paper towel back into the glass jar/or other container with a lid (not air tight) and leave for another 10 - 24 hours. Dont let the paper towel dry out, cause the seeds will die. After that, put the seeds into some potting soil in a dixie cup (or any other small container). Bury the seeds at 1/2 inch, shallow. Put in a sunny warm spot. Keep the soil moist, but not soaked. and wait another 24-48 hours... You should have some happy seedlings. This process is called sprouting. You could google it and read more on it. Sprouting is a quick way to get seeds to germinate. I know this was a long answer but it really is easy. Good Luck!|`|AA11723575	i just planted a squash seed from an acorn squash we had for supper last week. it took four days and its an inch high on its 6th day. put in moist soil cover loosely with saran and place in sunny window. try it or cuke may do as well as their seeds germinate fast too. sunflower is harder seed and may take longer.good luck!|`|7royFhIgaa	Try radish seeds.

Sprouts (radish, alfalfa) See link  1  Green beans, Watermelon See link  2|`|V4jecXwjaa	Well its tough to cram plants in that time, but i would recommend that you ask one of your teachers to allow you to use the greenhouse, and plant in a few different small pots a few sunflower seeds, pepper seeds, and perhaps squash seed. Whichever grows first, use for your project.    The reason i recommend using a greenhouse is because greenhouses provide excellent place for plants to germinate and grow in, and it can for the most part only increase your chance of success, given only 5 days! I used my school greenhouse for my market pepper project test generation, and germinated 200 Dulce and Grande Jalapeno seeds within 6 days i believe, so its worth a shot!    1 last idea, if all else fails go and buy some small plants at a local nursery|`|OuHCeRwJaa	No, but  annual bluegrass will begin to grow in 3 days.You can probably find some at Lowe's or similar  lying on the floor under the stacks of seed bags.

t3Mq9Tooaa	Try cooking them in almost boiling water. Keep taking one out and sticking it in a pot until it sinks. You may have to poke a small hole. Since there is so much air in an apple and the skin is non-permeable heating them would force the air to expand and move out, as they cooled it would draw water in making them heavier. Give it a shot, but poke a hole to let the air and water transfer easily. Good luck.|`|b2686104ef2480397eb802150472c27aaa	Try packing the apples into the vase first, as many as you can and then pouring the water over them. the less space in the vase the less likley they are to float.   you could also try clear glass rods. pierce the apples with the rods , "stringing" them along the rod and then placing them in the vase. They wont move then.   Another suggestion would be to try water crystals. its a powder that expands to form jelly like crystals when placed in water.

JLayHNZCaa	To add to the other answers, check to make sure the outside vent cover isn't blocked, covered or otherwise restricted.|`|AA11554181	Is there any clothes behind the dryer? Mine takes 1 hour just to dry a load of clothes.|`|yvAyaiMdaa	Make sure the lint filter is not plugged and  the gas hose is not bent, if you can check and make sure that the hose is not plugged with lint.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	Be sure to clean out the filter. The lint may have clogged up something.  Also, check the washer since it may not be agitating properly to wring out the excess water.  As for how long it should take, that depends on how much clothes you put in the dryer, how wet it is, how heavy it is.|`|sR3gcvubaa	Sometimes the heating element goes out.  You can have it replaced for a reasonable amont of $, but it may be financially better to replace the whole thing if it's very old rather than invest in something that doesn't have much life left.|`|cTyeHg1maa	if it is old, its probably dying. we recently got a new set after ours did that for about a year and then died.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	check your hose to make sure it's not plugged. clean your lint trap. what setting do you have the temp at. turn it up and see what happens. dryers run on 220 current and suck up electricity pretty fast. the sooner you find out what the problem is, the smaller your electric bills will be.|`|AA12300575	Sounds like the heating element is going out.|`|gjs1GXdTaa	Your bill should get pretty high. You are basically wasting power.It sounds like the heating element is going out.|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	Have you cleaned out your lint trap or checked your vent pipe? Usually when your dryer needs that long, those are the culprits.    If that's not the problem, check the heating element in your dryer, or ask a repairman to do so.    If you have an old machine, it might be worth your while to get a new one, especially since those tend to be made to be energy efficient.    Good luck!|`|ee97f3c7ffcf7d47dc6882e63330d45aaa	clean the vent tube to the out side air its clogged, if you clean the entire unit, it will perform like new again, power bill will drop right away to almost nil, entire full load done in 30 min|`|xbR3yMKsaa	Hope your heating element is not done for.

If there's a lint buildup, not only can this effect the machine's ability to dry clothes properly, it can be a fire hazard.   Also, how old is your machine? If it's about 10 years, it could be wearing down and ready to retire.|`|AA10498232	Clean the lint trap.

lavd3UHmaa	Yes! Kilz stain killer is perfect - just remember to wear a mask because that stuff is killer on the lungs.  sorry to hear of your 'mess'|`|WgruZkHRaa	Clean with tsp or something, then oil based kills. I would probably replace the drywall where it's worst and paint all of the walls with the oil based to stop kerosene smell that has been absorbed buy all the walls.|`|Rh2th9zqaa	Kilz oil based would be good but you will need to get the walls somewhat clean first. Try TSP in warm water but wear gloves. If the walls are drywall try to minimize getting them wet. Use fans and dry well befrore primering.|`|3aa8ae2bb3859884c9e133f59e89617daa	You may want to spray white vinegar prior to painting. It will help eliminate the smell.  1/2 & 1/2 with water|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Try using a microfibre cloth before you use anything else. Cheap at Costco in the automotive section. Even with just water, it might remove a great deal of the soot, and if you get one of those flat microfibre floor mops, they're very useful for the ceilings. With TSP or something, they'll remove even more. You have little to lose by trying since I'm sure you could use both of those somewhere if the house is that dirty. After you've washed, if the paint is still dingy looking, then yes, use Kilz, the strongest stain killer one. Soot tends to re-appear. Check the label on the Kilz before you use TSP. I seem to remember the can label recommending not to use that on walls that Kilz is going on, last time I used it. Tenants can be such fun. Surprised they didn't asphyxiate themselves.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	This is going to have to be washed off as much as possible. Use a good Kilz after and see if it's going to cover. You may have to use two coats if it dries yellow. allow it to dry completely first.       File a judgment against the tenants and see if you can recoup your losses, a entire paint job, maybe $1500.00
iloSQ8lUaa	Depends on how many footings you need if its a 10x20 deck which makes 200 sqft, you need one footing every 6 feet. One side gets tied to the house thus, you dont need footing there. 200 sqft is not a small deck. The materials will cost more than $500. Expect to see around $3,500 if not more. Alot of contractors are hurting. Shop around, you might just get good deal.  http://www.surehandsusa.com|`|LLeQyWGcaa	if you can do it yourself you would save half of your cost. the materials will cost you around 500 for treated . if you don't have to dig footings it is pretty easy.|`|OaCXjflMaa	I just built one about that size with composite. Cost me a little over $1,500. Would think you can drop about 400 off that for pressure treated. Add in a contractor then i would double that. So with a contractor i would say 2100-2500.

sqvv3e5Eaa	The firmest mattress is not good for your body and back. You should choose a mattress that can give your body a maximum support. The mattress should conform to the curves of your body in order to provide correct anatomical support.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	I think you get more body aches from sleeping on the floor. Having said that, I think you should test out the mattress and select whatever feels comfortable to you.  I like a medium firm mattress.  The super firm ones make my back hurt, contrary to what I was led to believe, but the soft ones feel lumpy and irritating to me.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Well, even the firmest bed is still softer than the floor. *shrugs* I don't prefer a firm bed, I mean I like there to be some structure, but I like plushness.

Leave the door and the hatch were you put in the detergent both open (makes for air flow) when you're not using the machine.  At least once a month, run something in a load of hot water and bleach.  And if you have hard water, a dose of white vinegar about once a month certainly will help.

I have had great success using this stuff.<br>  Chemicals, meat and greasy foods disturb the bacterial growth that make your septic tank work.

V4jecXwjaa	Onions can grow in both, but will do best in sunlight. Remember, Cold weather encourages leafy growth and warmer weather encourages bulb growth. This is why i plant my onions in late fall and harvest in spring.|`|CmNSdnWIaa	Onions,like most garden plants such as green beans and sweet corn,need lots of sunlight in order to thrive.In order for the plants to make the bulb,seeds,or kernels,the plants need energy and to make the energy they need sunlight.In a process called Photosynthesis  plants convert the water,the CO2,the minerals,and sunlight that they absorb into energy(in the form of a simple sugar called glucose)with the help of a chemical called chlorophyll.this energy is then store in the form of seeds,bulbs and kernels,which will be used to help the new plants grow when the seeds and such are planted the next year.Hope this helps.
omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "willow tree" (  7741) might be a good choice.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|nOVSf06Raa	whatever you do keep it light and natural you can add colour by using towels and pictures for the wall and greenery to make the bath feel like the outdoors fresh and clean you can use pictures like this one for example     http://www.posters.com/pv-506430_Waterfa...    http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/a-gu...|`|BKr3y30maa	Looking online is kind of tricky because there is a discrepancy in the way the colors look online compared to how they look in person.  However, I'm in the process of painting my bathroom and have decided to go with a color from Sherwin Williams called Embellished Blue.   It's a really pale blue, very beautiful.  Good luck!|`|9595804127573e4404441bfc1a008376aa	go to www.behr.com and click on color smart. you can mix and match colors from swatches in virtual rooms. it's really fun and helpful.
xXP91mYBaa	Yes,  Sealy is for the most part a company that specializes in coil spring mattresses and is  1 at what they do.    Tempur Pedic is THE best memory foam manufacturer on the market and they are also  1 for their respective sales.    With that being said there are some incredibly outstanding knock offs (copies). Lots of test resting different models, lots of research and homework, with a little bit of luck will help you sort through the mattress masses.    In the end the only thing that matters is what you like, because the rest of us don't have to sleep on it so listen to that little voice when test resting.    My preferences in order:  Organic Latex  Softside Waterbed  Memory Foam  Mattresses and Boxspring (soft) but supportive.  Air    http://www.stlbeds.com/|`|ZImEjmTFaa	Sam's Club sells an unbelievable pillow top matress and you can beat the price|`|sqvv3e5Eaa	You will need to try out the mattresses in order to feel which one suits you better. Sealy and Tempurpedic are reputable brands and they come with warranty. Memory foam mattresses from generic brands may be cheaper but some do not last as long as the branded ones. Make sure they come with warranty too.    This link has reviews of Sealy, Tempurpedic and mattresses from other brands.  http://www.memoryfoammattress101.com/mem...    Hope it helps :)|`|944iJNAdaa	I think there's even a big difference in the different Posturepedic models.  This is a question you can't really answer without laying on some mattresses, and examining their construction.  Your back will have to guide you here.
2kuD6Domaa	Try to avoid salt all together.  Salt (sodium chloride)  is good on ice and bad on concrete.  Use an ice melter that contains calcium chloride, potassium chloride, or magnesium chloride.  Whatever you use just be sure to keep the excess off the concrete.  As the product melts the ice scrape or sweep off the slush and excess melting agent.|`|rSwce38saa	I'm not sure exactly on your question, but I know that if you have any type of "cement"-ed driveway, salt or ice melt will DEFINATELY ruin the driveway.    I had my driveway redone last year, and there was a lot of snow with (about) 8 months, so naturally I put salt to melt the ice. When summer came, there were cracks and "roughage" all around the driveway.
VqroslvKaa	I recommend calling a professional for help. http://www.heatingsystemsrepair.com|`|XOPvmV5Iaa	I don't think you're going to have much luck in fixing that. You might be able to find some porcelain patching material that may work. It's like a white paste to fix bathtubs and sinks, but I have my doubts it will stand up to heat.    Another option would be to use some sandpaper or a sharpening stone to polish the area of the chips.
lavd3UHmaa	The reason it is still bleeding through is because all paints start as a base-white and thick.  Then pigment is included to get the desired color.  In dark colors, more pigment is required, thus 'watering down' the paint.  So, when something is watered down, the more you need to apply to create a solid look.  Dark pinks, reds, etc need a lot of layers.  Make sure that the paint is fully dry between coats.  Good luck.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	The Lowes person gave you proper advice but he should have told you that with deeper colors you must give it no less than 2 coats of paint.  I know this from experience because I have used wall colors such as red, orange, yellow etc. Use 2, or 3 coats if necessary.  It's not a matter of whether you used flat versus oily base.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Painting a heavy dark colour will take 3-5 coats depending on your colour and paint quality to cover evenly and get the look you want. Next time stay away from general stores like Lowe's and go to a specialized paint store..they have more experience and will tell you little helpful hints about painting. Once you have some experience under your belt, you will know what to expect. Just keep painting..sooner or later you will get the colour you desired and you will love it.|`|Z4dSv7kBaa	the guy at lowes doesnt kno what hes talkin bout. your gonna need a primer. sorry!|`|xbR3yMKsaa	This rough==there should have been a primer or to use a flat paint on what was painted.

My son was like 12  or 13  and  into hunting. It turned out pretty decent        Good Luck|`|yvAyaiMdaa	oil base is not the best to use on walls... you need to prime the walls first and then paint... also go to DIY.com for answer on painting|`|9595804127573e4404441bfc1a008376aa	the lowe's guy was wrong. you needed a tinted primer.

L8zmQS8Jaa	I assume you are referring to a hot water coil in your boiler.  After the boiler there is probably a mixing valve.  This tempers the hot water with cold water to keep it from getting too hot.  It is possible that debris in the lines from the new installation has gotten caught here and is making this valve stick.      If it is constantly on this may the a thermostat or aquastat problem.  It is difficult to diagnose such problems with certainty from a distance.  Have the installer come back and check out the system.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Possibly.  Takes care and skill and experience, but it can work.<br>  <br>  An easier, nearly no-fault method is "layering".  Take a long flexible branch, and gently pull it down so that part of it is touching the ground.  At the point where it's touching the dirt, nick the bark horizontally (don't cut THROUGH it, just nick it), and then bury that point under 1/2" of soil.  Keep watered.  In 4-6 weeks, it should have grown rootlets, and then you can cut the branch connecting it to the mother plant, and transplant your new plantlet.  Works like gangbusters.|`|QfsZh5g2aa	You could root rosemary in water, but there is no reason to. Why make a plant go through that stressful process twice? Water borne roots are different than those developed in a solid medium. <br>  Take three or so inch tip cuttings, remove bottom leaves carefully. Insert the cuttings into a coarse potting medium (part potting mix and part perlite), water them in thoroughly, and place them in a warm, fairly bright location until rooted....about 2 to 3 weeks (or more at this time of year), and ready to repot in several weeks. <br>  <br>  If doing several cuttings, don't over crowd them. Be careful not to over water your cuttings, and do not pull them from the soil to see if they're 'ready'. New root hairs break off every time you do that. <br>  <br>  If taking cuttings from outdoor grown plants, be CERTAIN that you are not bringing spider mites in with you.|`|qed3TW7Faa	Cut off a section and put the end in root powder - that usually works really well and the plant will take so you can repot it and eventually put it back in the garden if thats what you want.

More to the point, though, you can't get honey out without destroying a wild hive, and the bees aren't going to like that.  Beekeepers would use a smoker to calm the bees down, but beekeepers also use wooden hives with removeable frames, so the honeycombs can be taken out without destroying the hive.  In the old days the pioneers were said to chop down trees that had honeybees in them, I imagine they took quite a few stings doing it, too.<br>  <br>  p.s.  there wouldn't be much honey there this time of year, anyway, because bees use honey to survive through the winter, and they're probably starting to run short about now.  Honey stores will be greatest right after the end of the flowering season in your area.

They make excellent progress daily and come in many types and sizes. After the flower opens and seeds ripen, depending on the type you grew, Tony will be able to eat them or feed some birds as well as replant a couple! The petals can even be added to salads. They can be started inside, then transplanted to an outside balcony pot and left to grow there. For the inside plants all over the flat, consider helping them set up a corner spot with a grow light and make a terraced container garden with lettuce,  peppers, chives, and the other plants he has going either on a table top or shelving set up. If cats are not around, catnip grows fast and can be used in teas as well as dried and sold/given to cat owners. (If there is a cat around- they will destroy the plant no matter if you put it in a safe with 3 chains and padlocks!)

2f37c4a51d965f4120f1f09e594cddb5aa	Hi.  I believe what you're looking for is liquid starch.  Liquid starch used to be easy to find, but has been largely replaced here in the US by starch in aerosol cans.  On the upside, there is far less waste with the cans.<br>  <br>  Sizing is applied to fabric during the manufacturing process because it helps keep the fabric from stretching so much, as well as helping keep the fabric clean.  Dirt adheres to the starch and help keeps the fabric from staining.<br>  <br>  Rayon is a cool fabric, but once you wash the sizing out of it you will find that it wrinkles more easily and may not hold its shape as well.  I just use spray starch on my rayon blouses and skirts and then iron them.  <br>  <br>  I also wash all my rayon in the machine, but you have to be careful that you use the most delicate cycle.  I hang the clothing up to dry.  Rayon is a pretty delicate fabric and has a tendency to fray, so be sure not to put the fabric in the dryer.<br>  <br>  If your top is made out of a rayon knit - looks like a sweater - be sure to lay it flat to dry!  One of the downsides of rayon sweater  knits is that it easily loses its shape.  <br>  <br>  When ironing rayon, be careful not to pull the fabric out of shape. Starch does leave an invisible residue when used properly, but that only helps the garment.  If you use too much starch it will look white and peel off.  It won't hurt the fabric and won't discolor it.  It washes out with water and will actually extend the life of any of your clothing because it helps keep fabric from staining.<br>  <br>  I would try washing one of your tops following my instructions.  If you're happy with the way the top comes out, go ahead and wash the other ones at home.  If you're not happy with the results, you're going to have to bite the bullet and send the shirts to the dry cleaners.<br>  <br>  Check out the links below for more info.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

fNuMoHt7aa	When choicing a compressor one of the most important things to look at is its CFM rating. This is how fast the compressor can build pressure. When looking for a compressor a couple monthes ago i was looking for the same thing you are. Most manufactures recommended about 3.5 CFM @90 psi to run a framing gun. Most cheaper pancake compressors are not rated this high. <br>  <br>  The only compressor you listed gave this information on the website. the bostitch at 2.8. For just a diyer this is fine. The only time you might notice the lack of power would be installing plywood sheating since you can drive alot of nails in a short period of time. Im not saying you cant do it you just will have to wait a couple seconds before each shot if the compressor does not shut off.|`|d1acfd2b69dcb7239283328cfde761c5aa	for a framing nailer you need a compressor that has 120psi operating pressure.

I have a cheap 3 gallon compressor that I use with a framing nailer. I have the pressure set at 90 pounds and it works fine. Framing nailers do not use much air per nail. If you operate it like a machine gun,you may need to wait occasionally for the compressor to refill.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	You can use a six gallon compressor with a framing nailer and it will work fine as long as you remember that after about 10 shots you may have to break and wait for the air to catch up.  <br>  <br>  But it should be fine for a do it yourselfer.

Be happy at any temperature.|`|UNUJNgHxaa	First off a thermostat NOT only reads the temp. of a room it also senses the air around it. This includes the temperature of the wall it is on. That is why they do not recommend a thermostat be installed on an outside wall. The best solution to your problem is to have a secondary thermometer mounted right next to the thermostat. Compare the difference in temp. readings. Now I have a question. Is the thermostat an electronic one? is it a mechanical one? If it is a mechanical one I would recommend replacing it with a more accurate and efficient electronic one. A mechanical t-stat are a lot less accurate than an electronic one.  I hope this helps. And good luck to you.|`|AA10042205	Thermostats are not good thermometers.  Buy you a small thermometer, and locate it close to the thermostat.  Just pretend the thermostat doesn't have any numbers.

If it dont work its probably seam adhesive wich is virtually impossible to remove from wallpaper on|`|wJhZnNV7aa	I would think if you tried using warm soapy water and it didn't come off that it may be something else. Maybe if you used wallpaper glue remover on a q-tip and then on just the spots lightly that may remove it and hopefully not remove your wallpaper. If that doesn't take it off is it maybe some silicone or a grease that maybe was on the builders hands. I'm not really sure. Good luck hopefully you figure it out.|`|AA10097817	Possibly, the paper started to come away from the wall and the previous owner used white glue to "fix" it. I'd try warm to hot water to try to loosen it.|`|be982918bdc646ec410302c900541b83aa	I hang alot of wallpaper and they make a specific product that I have used a couple times when I failed to get all the paste off.Can't remember the name but I am sure they sell it at H/D Lowes etc.<br>  <br>  I have also heard that you can spray Windex on the dried adhesive and let sit for 10 minutes and then after the paste loosens wipe it off.Just be careful the windex doesn't "run" down the paper and also try a small unnoticeable spot first.It could discolor some wallpaper.
H1R4B3vZaa	Ya them pest can really spoil laying on the floor but i hope i can help you deal with them,As a rule there bite is as bad as a bee sting and that only being they are big enough to break the skin,So its not likely your going to get very ill unless you have a allergy to them,Now first off what is around your house that draws them in, They like moist dark areas under dead logs leaves that have set or even rocks and heavy things.But they are 90% water so they must keep a high water intake.Do you have a moist basement.Very wet soil outside that dont drain well.Theses are a few things to look at.IF you see a pile of leaves near the house get rid of them.Old logs or things of such near the house move it or rid of it.To treat you can purchase seven dust in 5 or 10 % to dust ouside of the foundation and along base boards inside.This pesticide works well sweep it up every week or so and apply new until you have complete controll.Remember to keep childrens hands away from that stuff.Its not deadly but any poison organic or not should be kept away from children.This dust is toxic to those little walking worms.Hope this helps and you get controll.|`|JsCxvEtCaa	there just as scarred of you as you are of them.  they catch other bugs and do not attack people.  DE (diatamacious earth) sprinkled at door openings may help|`|EJSdI25Naa	Oxalic acid from the hardware. Sprinkle it around inside your cabinets. It won't hurt you or the kids but ants and insects steer clear.
AA11789739	Si te refieres a un sistema de desagüe de canalón, no necesitas aleros. Sencillamente el canal se fija al borde del techo, ya sea con aleros o en losa de concreto con saliente. Si es techo de losa con borde al ras de las pared es lo mismo: fijarlo al borde. Lo importante es revisar el ajuste del borde del canalón contra el borde del techo y agregar impermeabilizante para evitar la filtracion del agua entre el canal y el techo.|`|xJte8D59aa	con aleros es mejor y mas economico.|`|oPRQhaspaa	hola los desagues de los techos se canalizan por medio de canales que desaguan en los bajantes ,los canales pueden ser de diferentes materiales para ello te informaran en cualquier almacen de materiales de construccion sin costo alguno por tu parte. saludos marinero de cuba
