20090307181329AAsmIfb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: Is anyone else sick of this argument-type scenario.....?	......that you can't seem to escape from close-minded people?      Other Person: Being gay is a choice.      You: No being gay is not a choice.      Other Person: Yes it is, see there's a choice in everything you do in life.      You: OK? So you're saying that being gay is something that you do?      Other Person: Yes, you choose to sleep with the same sex.      You: Well being gay isn't only about sex. Gay people also have thoughts and feelings for the same sex just like straight people have them for the opposite sex.      Other Person: Yes, but you can still choose to resist those feelings....      You: OK? So you're saying that I should be with someone I have absolutely no feelings for? I agree that you can be with anyone or have sex with anyone, but the question is, do you want to have sex with someone you don't have any feelings for?      Other Person: Well there is no gay gene. If homosexuality was natural and as unchosen as heterosexuality, then there would be a gay gene.      You: Well I don't know the extent of the truth to that, but there is no straight gene and you seem to have no problems believing that heterosexuality is natural.      Other Person: Well we know that heterosexuality is natural because procreation comes from it, and the bodies of men and women fit.      You: Oh a man's body cannot fit another man's? But I do it all the time!      Other Person: That doesn't mean it fits, what you're doing there, is putting something where it don't belong.      You: How do you know it don't belong there?      Other Person: Because it's useless for semen to be in someone's anus.      You: Well heterosexuals have anal sex, oral sex, and use various means of contraception.      Other Person: Well they CHOOSE to do that, but they're not supposed to, it's their genitals that fit together and that is what they're supposed to do. Still unrelated to homosexual sex.      You: Oh really? Why then do heterosexuals have sex for other reason's than to procreate also?      Other Person: To make love.      You: And homosexuals don't do it to make love?      Other Person: I'm not arguing that, but heterosexuals also do it to reproduce and that means it's the only natural form of sex, if everyone in the world was homosexual, then the population would die out.      You: Well if everyone in the world was a priest or a nun committed to their vow of celibacy, then wouldn't the same problem happen?      Other Person: Yes, but that wouldn't happen, God only picks a small number of people to be in the ministry.      You: You're using religion?      Other Person: Uh-huh      You: Why?      Other Person:        You: Because religion is the only resource. Without it, you have no case!

I have nothing against gays, but I wouldn't want people thinking I'm something that I'm not.       And it shows that most people in general are just selfish and judgmental by virtue of the fact that they make this assumption in the first place. It also shows that most people are inherently biased towards gays. After all, if people think there's no problem with being gay, then why raise the issue? Why start speculating that a single guy isn't married because he's gay?

My cousin has a friend who is a girl and they got to be really close. Just last night she told me that they are together and have been for a while, and I can see how it would be hard to confess it, especially since she didn't know how I felt about same sex couples. We are like sisters so we tell each other everything. But I was wondering, how against the Christian religion is it, or is it against it? Cuz I'm a Christian and don't know how I should feel about this. I live in Wisconsin and my cousin lives in Indiana, so we don't see each other too often, but what if I react weird if I see them in person?? And how do I get more used to it? I don't want to look uncomfortable or anything. What do you think?

Alright I am black, have always been and will always be BUT a lot of people I come in contact with find it hard to belive both my parents are black. I have green/hazelish eyes and am VERY bright (my legs and feet are powder) and my hair natural is very wavy and curl like an S at the root.      Im not going to claim multi-racial because of those things, I was raised in a black household and my family (except those who married in) are all black.       But looking at it from a strictly genetic stand point, you think I could be considered multi-racial?       Oh my great great grandmother was a Seminole Indian, if that even counts.

20090307182257AA6Evdd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Just want to make some stuff clear about Mormons!?	The LDS church does not support polygamy. We supported it for a very short time because all the men were dying out in the Prairie, and somebody was needed to support the women and children. You people who say we are a cult have some serious problems. We are nothing of the sort. I don't understand how people can think we are bad about the ideas we support. No rated R movies, no drinking of hot drinks or alcoholic beverages, no adultery, murder, no gambling, no swearing, obey the law of chastity, and dress modestly be forgiving, oh, and also no stealing, and just be happy with our lives. I follow these basic rules, and of course, I am not perfect. Sometimes I am having a bad day and just act mean, but at least, if I die in my sleep, I can know that I lived my life righteously. We go to church every Sunday, dressed in Sunday clothes, partake of the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice so we could repent for our sins, listen to the speakers, go to Sunday school, and then go to our next meeting which could be young womens, young mens, relief society, or priest's session. I am telling you, you cannot read the book of Mormon and think that a fourteen year-old boy just made up all of that stuff. Mormons all support each other, even the youth. My week just feels so much better if I go to church each Sunday. Mormons are not any type of cult or anything like that. We are the only whole true church on the earth today. We worship Christ and God only. Nobody else, and I am not saying that if you are a part of another church, you are a bad person. I have met so many wonderful people from other churches. Its just lately, I have heard all this crap about Mormons, and I wanted to clarify.

20090307184110AAnoU0Z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jews, can I be a Chassidic Jew without doing any kind of formal conversion?	My maternal grandmother's family were Orthodox Jews and she was given away to a gentile family as a very young child to hide her during World War II. Her Jewish birth parents and all other relatives were killed in the Holocaust and she was left to be raised by the gentile family and was taught to view them as her real parents. My grandmother got married to a gentile herself and had my mother and my mother wasn't raised Jewish, my mother in turn married a gentile and I wasn't raised with the Jewish faith.   But my mother is divorced from my father now and we moved to New York, I've always been interested in traditional Judaism and I got my mother interested in her background too. I would like to start living as an Orthodox Jew, or perhaps a Lubavitcher and marry an Orthodox guy and have a Jewish family. Can I just start practicing and join such a shul without doing any sort of conversion because I wasn't brought up practicing Judaism?

Then I see this girl with a nice butt and that also pisses me off because it caught my attention.      The thing is that for some reason, it bugs me that women show off their stuff.  I'm trying to be a gentleman and not stare, but they still get my eyes hooked.  I was pissed the whole time everytime I saw partially exposed boobs.

Now, I can understand if the person gave a:      - Highly ignorant or offensive response   - Answer that was completely irrelevant to the question   - An answer that spams/proselytizes/etc..      But a genuine disagreement of opinion? Is that really a reason to thumbs down someone, or is that just letting one's personal pride get in the way?

Me and my gal pal (who's 40, I'm 13) were in her car and we were talking about how kids today are growing up more cushy-like and how they're not being exposed to the outside world and that they aren't really becoming independent and probably end up being bad adults.      We were saying how we think kids shouldn't be grown by parents spoiling and making their life more easy. We think kids should be exposed to hard experiences and controversies in the world so they can form themselves and learn form those experiences and events so they can become better adults.      What do you think?

20090307201551AA7lk9L	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	How do you see your role as affecting subsequent generations and did you ever envision todays reality?	Each generation of parents, as well as society at large, have a part in shaping the next generation.        In the 40's, it was all about the family unit and being hush hush about certain topics.  Men and women had very defined roles in society and at home.  Their children grew up to be independent, free thinkers who defined the 60's.  With lots of them divorced/single parents, that generations' children became the latch-key kids of the 80's.  Latch-key kids had to grow up quickly and fend for themselves.  As a result, when they grew up and had children, they have showered them with everything, leading to the current generation known for short attention spans and "its all about me, me, me" attitudes.        1)  How do you see your role as affecting subsequent generations that got us where we are today and 2)  Did you ever imagine todays reality as a possibility?

20090227095013AAc10Cp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How do you forgive someone who has broke your heart?	What should I do. I am 27 years old, and I started dating this 59 year old man, about 2 years ago. I must admit, I did not love him at first, I had to grow to love him and learned to appreciate the things he was doing for me, besides his money. As time had passed into the relationship,I did cheat on him, with  much younger men because I was not attracted to him sexually. Because of his age, this man had a problem with having an erection during sex. I know this is not a excuse for cheating on him, because 2 wrongs don't make a right.On down the line, we became in engaged, and yes, my ring was almost $6,000, but things changed later. As a full time nursing student(RN) in college, I did not spend a lot of time with him, because I had to study, But whenever I had some time, I would do what he wanted me to do because he was doing so much for(money wise). we soon begin to have problem, and we could not get alone with each other. I later found out that he was sleeping my neighbor, and they have been in  relationship for a few months, long before I found out. Although, I did cheat to, I had more respect for him, then what he had for me. I believe that no one is perfect and we all make mistakes and sometimes it's not what you do, it's how you do it. Now I can't understand why is this young lady mad with me, when you are sleeping with my ex-boyfriend, who I thought was my soon to be husband.Even though I cheated too, I done it because this man always made me feel like, I needed him more because he has more than me. Also, I wanted to feel loved by a man who liked and loved me from me, instead of being mistreated by someone who has a lot money. I also came back and told him the truth about my past(cheating), I wanted him to do the same, but he did not. He still lie's about it to me, and he does not have no respect for me. I was willing to forgive him, no matter what he has done, because I know I was not perfect myself. But, for some reason, He would rather have a street woman before he be with me. I love this man, and God knows I do, But I can't change him. I have asked and prayed to God about it, and I don't know what eles to do. I feel so hurt and mad because I have now learned to love him beyond his money. You know, I love this man so much , if he needed me to wipe his butt and I knew he could not do it, I will do it, when the other women in street would walk away and turn their back on him, guess what, I'll still be there. I 'm sorry, and I wish he would feel the same, instead of thinking about a street woman. All, I want to do is, forgive them both, and remove these feelings out of my heart for him, and continue my education in school. By the way, my ex-boyfriend have someone who do not want anything in life. She is a street woman, so sad, and she can't look me in my face....... Please give me some advices on how to move on with my life.... I have learned from mistakes, But it's sad to say, he have not...........................

We get monitored occasionally and while I don’t get 100% monitoring evaluations, my feedback has improved and I try my hardest.  Well, I have several different supervisors, but one in particular doesn’t like me for whatever reason (I truly have no idea, but I understand that not every is going to like you). Anyway, some of the other supervisors are on vacation and she’s been around every time I’ve worked for the past week.  Well, she’s always monitoring me and just listening in on my conversations to point out something I did wrong even though she “wasn’t monitoring me.”  I feel like I am going insane and that she is just being plain wrong.  She’s taking it to an extreme.  I’ve been able to keep calm and politely respond that I will do better next time, but I’m starting to reach my breaking point.  What are my options if any besides quitting?
20090227100026AAvqcDT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is faith that God exists and that God created the universe enough for you to fork over taxes to support church?	I work hard fo the money.      I don't like taxes, and I don't like a lot of what tax money goes towards in the U.S.      Lots of stuff our government does is influenced by religion.  Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research is curtailed in part because religious leaders are concerned that souls will be imperiled by using aborted or otherwise untenable embryonic cells for research.  Freedom of speech is curtailed because a particular sculpture or painting or structure offends the sensibilities of the religious.  The utterance of certain words on TV is curtailed because religious parents don't want to explain to their children the meaning of life.  Non-missionary sexual activity and related topics are censored in favor of religious doctrine forbidding such from falling upon tender ears.      Are you fine with having tax dollars you have worked for be dedicated to the suppression of human knowledge and enjoyment?  Is fear of the intangible reasonable grounds to prevent advancement and ease of suffering of tangible people?

20090307201417AApHIs5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So my mother suspects me of being gay.?	She came to this conclusion after I refuse to go to church, and whenever she brings up a religious question I don't want to answer. So by using he poor reasoning skills she concluded that I am living a lifestyle I am ashamed of, and that is the reason why I don't want to go to church.       Now of course I am not gay, even thought I have been having troubles getting a girl lately since I am shy. But the reason I don't want to go to church is because I feel it is a waste of time since I am atheist.       Now I am afraid to tell my mother this because she is batshit insane, and poorly educated to the point where a junior high schooler is most likely smarter than her. And I am afraid to tell her I am an atheist because when I was 16 she kicked me out when I refused to read something from the bible.

Neighbors who like to make noise      I live in county (Not inside city limits) where nuisance or noise ordinances are NOT applicable.      My neighbors who live an acre and a half away have a heavy metal band in which they hook up to amplifiers and blast away. I have called the landlord (who lives in another state) and threatened legal action and also contacted the Sheriffs Office on multiple occasions in which they have come out and taken my statement and warned they band group.      The band continues to play and now Sheriffs office won’t ticket or arrest  or do anything unless these morons are playing after 10pm at night. The music is so loud that I can here it in my house when I put the kids to bed. I have 6 separate neighbors who are also very irritated and we all want something done about it. The landlord can’t seem to control them and the Sherriff won’t do anything until after 10pm. I have to put my kids to bed at 8pm with music vibrating through the windows.      I have someone who rents my RV spot and shop on the property who is threatening to move out because of the noise and I will soon be at a financial loss.      How do I kick these neighbors and their landlord in the rear end? I am so tired of this and it has been going on for months.

20090307202511AAf3Vy8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, what do you think of this?	Christians on this site are constantly putting walls of biblical quotes in their answers and questions. What about these bible quotes? Do you ignore them?      Exodus 2:11-12   Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his people, the Israelites, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of the Hebrew slaves. After looking around to make sure no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.      Moses killed a guy? That breaks one of the Ten Commandments he supposedly wrote down.      Deuteronomy 22:23-24    If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.      So, you kill rape victims because they didn't scream loud enough...that um...that totally makes sense.      There are hundreds of bible quotes I could put in this question but I think two should suffice without boring you to pieces.      So, what do you think of these? Do you ignore them when reading the bible?

To connect those things: If you think about it, your life does not make any difference in the scheme of things. What you do has no effect on the Universe, not even on earth. No matter what you do, you will still die. So, is life really about pleasing your body? In whatever form you chose to do this? Are you, "the brain" in control, or does the body really use the brain to find better ways of pleasing itself... This is sad...

They are barbarians who exploit the liberal media out of one side of their mouths, then bomb us out the other side. They are cowards who are crazy and kill themselves to kill us true believers. The American military is the most righteous and brave of all, and that is why God blessed this holiest of nations.      Be rest assured, when the anti-Christ comes, he will be Muslim.

20090307204217AAe4Z0x	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How do I deal with a manager that has a bad attitude?	So I have worked at this restaurant for 8 months now, so basically I know how things run around the place. Well this manager that was on maternity leave when I first started working there is back and basically has a really bad attitude towards me and a few other employees (she is selective). Today I came into work and I was there for not even 5 mins and I was trying to figure out what was going on (with who is coming in, breaks, whose leaving, and what I had to do based on what time I left since we do house keeping and depending what time you leave you get different things). Anyway, she says to me, there are dishes in the back you need to bring up, so I go back there and there is like 2 plates... and thats it... so I grab them and bring them up, I then try to look around for something to do (because I get paid $4 an hour so I wanna make sure I am productive!) then I get sat a table. I go over get their drinks, and they aren't ready yet. So I go the back computers and kind of watch them to see when they are ready (btw the place is dead at this point, not much going on) and another waiter comes up to me and we start to talk. She walks by and says there are dishes in back there you all don't need to be standing around. So we both kind roll our eyes because there isn't any really, plus she has a really bad attitude about asking people to do things. I stay there and wait for my table to decide, while the other waiter walks back there to look for dishes to bring up. Not even 3 seconds later she was back and says btw that was ment for you, not him.       I have worked in 4 different places and I can't recall anyone talking to me with that sort of attitude. I didn't do anything for her to talk to me like that, I bust my butt off every night I work to make sure things are done. Also none of the other managers talk to the workers like that. I feel really un apperciated for the work I do. Also I feel like if it were another employee that has worked there longer than me then she wouldn't have said anything. If she needs anything why can't she just nicely tell me or ask me like the other managers. Its really hard because one reason I have a job in the public is so I can be around people (my husband is deployed and I don't know anyone where I live) I don't really know how to deal with a manager having such a bad attitude, but I really want to do something about it, I absolutley don't like working with her, and that is rarely an issue with me. Also I don't want to stop working there because I am just starting to make some good friends. But if  I have to deal with her talking to me like that, I will stop working there. It sucks because I am a good worker and I know that because they give me a lot of hours versus people that aren't so great they cut hours. Plus I make good tips. I have never had anyone to complain about my inablity to do my job. However I have heard other employees complain about this manager and how she is a B****.... anyway, what should I do? How should I deal with this?????

I'm not out yet; but the last couple of guy's I've liked and thought liked me would send mixed signals. We would be really cool flirt a little and then they would start talking to me less and paying less attention to me. And then they would start talking to me and things would be great and they'd back off.      So maybe I've just been liking straight guys and they think we're getting too close. Idk. It's annoying.      And the guy I like now is like mixed signals on steroids I kid you not. We would be laughing together he'd stand close and then he'd walk away and like hide. And I was talking to my best friend who is fairly handsome; when the guy I like saw me talking to him he started treating me different he got like more distant for a little bit. It was weird. Idk.       So is it just me or do other people have that issue too?

20090307204756AAnVSqW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jehovah's Witnesses? Doesn't it count?	I was on the watchtower site, and I was reading the article, 'Does God Listen To Your Prayers?', and I read that Jehovah only listens and responds to prayers of the righteous ones. Now, I am by no means righteous. I really don't try as hard as I should, and everytime I light a cigarette, my heart hurts, everytime I utter a swear word, my heart hurts, everytime I sin, I hurt bad in my heart. I've been born into the religion, but I've been on and off with it. But only I know, and only Jehovah knows, how much I want to be in the paradise. But I feel that it's not enough. Yeah, I know I need to try harder, I know, I KNOW!!!! But it's SO much easier said than done. I want to go to meetings, I want to study the bible, I want to quit smoking, I want to stop or AT LEAST tone down the swearing, I want to be a faithful servant of Jehovah God. But I feel that even though I have this passionate 'want' I feel that it's not enough. So all this time I've been praying to Jehovah for help, I can't help but feel it was for nothing. However, last year, my dad almost died. He was in the hospital, all sick and everything, and I cried everyday to Jehovah to help him. I poured my heart out. My dad made a full recovery. But before he became ill, I was smoking and partying as usual. I don't only want to pray to Jehovah when I need Him, but I want to pray to Him, just to thank Him for everyday that I wake up. I want to thank Him that even in this messed up economy, my family is still O.K. I want to thank him for giving me courage. I want to thank him for giving me relief when something is wrong. All this time I thought he was never listening to me, but deep down inside, despite what the article says; I still can't help but think that he DOES hear me, even though I'm far from deserving his listening ear. But what I'm asking is, doesn't it count that I care when I sin, and I care when I know I hurt Jehovah?      Sorry, I don't mean to write a whole novel, I just really needed to get this out.

There is this girl in my psych class that had been sitting next to me in class all along. Well she added me as a friend on facebook, and I was her 8th friend. When I looked at her profile I realized the she was also lesbian, so I figured she got gaydar, (which is nt that hard with me) most people can tell i am lesbian. So for days on end we were chatting and flirting on facebook for hours at a time, and exchanging cds in psych class. So last night we were supposed to meet on facebook at 9:00 and she wasnt there. So I waited for a while and she came on and didnt even bother to write to me at all. She was hinting yesterday that she wanted to hang out sometime this week, so we were going to decide today where to meet up. I also realized that she deleted the part in her profile that said that she was interested in women?? For the most part, SHE is the one that talks to ME, so I am confused as to what is up with her?? If anyone has any advice, it would be helpful! Thanks in advance.

20090307203500AACN2yh	Society & Culture;Languages	Japanese verb plain forms + desu?	I'm very confused right now. I'm well aware of Japanese verbs and how they work by now, but recently I've been coming across a new "form" that has been confusing the heck out of me.      Using the anime Cardcaptor Sakura as an example, I came across these two lines:      Episode 3 - Koko e hairu desu ka?      Episode 28 - Meiling chan mo, o-kaado wo kawareta desu ka?      My confusion is, obviously, why weren't these verbs conjugated to their polite forms, instead of simply adding "desu" at the end of the sentence? That is: hairu = hairimasu, and: kau = kawareru = kawaremashita.      I know that one can do this with verbs in their plain negative or plain past negative form, if the speaker is too lazy to conjugate the verb probably (iku = ikanai desu, rather than ikimasen), but I never knew this could be done with the plain positive or plain past positive form! I guess I never really thought about it, though.      So, someone who is more familiar with Japanese and how their verbs work than I am, please reply to this and give me some confirmation and/or explanation of this so that my overly-inquisitive mind can finally be set at ease. >_<      Thanks a lot!
20090307203825AAwqXEf	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Is there a ghost in my house?	Since I moved here (2002?) my family and I have been experiencing some weird things. So my dad had just put in a new mirror/medicine case on the wall of my bathroom, he took down the mirror that had been there for a very long time. So maybe its linked?  So, just a couple days ago, I was sitting on the couch, watching tv, home alone with my dog. Suddenly I hear something, imagine boxes filled with glass stacked up and somebody pulled it down. It was so loud and it lasted for about 3 seconds. I had thought my dog had knocked down a lamp but she didn't. I was scared to see what it was. But I got up and slowly opened all the doors and absolutely nothing had fallen. Is it a ghost? One of my friends said something about a 'omen'. Heck, I have no idea what that means.       Thanks.

20090307205439AAZjP7V	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How can i ask my best friend if he's gay?	this has been an often asked question for years. my best friend (were 15) has been close with me for a few years, about three. when i first met him i suspected he may be but then i felt bad about myself for ever thinking that. about a year later i started thinking that way again and now i could care less if he was, it would actually be cool. everyone thinks he is, except for three girls who have all recently had feelings for him. i know these reasons aren't good and are stereotypes but all together they make him seem gay.   -he's one of the girls, he doesn't have many guy friends and none of his guy friends are close with him.   -he talks/acts/walks/dresses like he's gay   -listens to "girl" music   -often jokes about being gay, is quite good at it, and gets carried away with it.      i've asked a few guys who have "a problem" with him why they don't like him, and they say he's catty and says things behind your back or over the computer but can't say them to your face. when guys get pissed off at him they call him gay and he used to get mad and say he wasn't but now he says "thanks, i know"      when he gets rejected by a girl or ends a relationship he isn't very hurt and moves on quickly.      me and a friend both want to ask him but we don't want to offend him,    how do we ask him without hurting his feelings or just flat out asking it ?

20090307213914AAlG1vq	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Help! I have a problem with arguing with my girlfriend?	I came from a family with an abusive father. I always hated him, his temper and bad treatment to my mother and I. My mom eventually sought divorce, and she regretted ever meeting him. I don't want to be like him at all, I want to treat my girlfriend the best ways possible so she will not be regret knowing me.   Here is the problem. Conflict exists everywhere in this world; handle conflicts in a good way can benefit a relationship more than constantly trying to dodge the problem, because it can let both my girlfriend and I know each other and live with each other better. But, I can't. Anything related to my father is being locked and put away in my mind, anything that might link my behavior to him, to the misery of my mom is being forbidden to think about by my mind. Arguing, or showing any emotion toward the dislike of things my girlfriend did [minor ones], is a taboo. I am like a baker who has never seen a frying pan, how should I know the right way to bake cakes? I don't. I had never seen what a good argument, a good argument where a couple discuss their problems toward an agreement while in peace is like; I had no idea how I am suppose to react, so emotionally I choose to escape and ignore the dislikes while intellectually I knew that it is bad for the relationship to do that.   So...please tell me what a good argument is like. A good argument between boyfriend and girlfriend where both people are at peace with each other, and in the end, a good negotiation is made and the relationship is strengthened. And...is there some sort of raising voice in one of these healthy arguments? and how high should my voice go before it is too high?   and... i know this sounds weird...but   what are my hands suppose to do? through my life I see my father has a beer bottle/knife/stick waving in his hand, or throwing chairs and other big things around, which is wrong and something i am not going to do   but i had never seen a good, healthy argument, I don't know what it suppose to look like, and certainly don't know what my hands are suppose to be/do, what kind of gesture should i make.   p.s. I am Chinese American. In China, especially Northeastern China, domestic violence is so common that seeing one family without it, is very rare   Please help me.....thanks

20090307214736AAy6Wyv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Where is your thinking..?	It seems to me that many religious people have nicely developed critical thinking skills that they use when it comes to a whole bunch of other stuff! =)      For instance, if I told a regular Christian the story of Mormonism, about the golden plates that were supposedly found by Joseph Smith in his garden, which was a divine message that was written down, but then magically disappeared, they would call BS on it. "Where is your evidence for THAT?", they would say.      So why is it that they don't use the same sense of criticism when it comes to their very own religion? Probably because they've been indoctrinated for so long, and they really, really want to believe it.      Still, I was simply wondering if you religious people are even aware of this. Do you know what you're doing? That tons of others topics are considered rationally by you, but somehow your religion slides through that?      And if you do know:   Are you fine with it? Why or why not?   Please explain...

So avoid people like these.       3:6 For some of these insinuate themselves  into households and captivate weak women  who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions,      3:7 Such women are always seeking instruction,  yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.      3:8 And just as Jannes and Jambres  opposed Moses, so these people – who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith  – also oppose the truth.      3:9 But they will not go much further,  for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.        3:10 You, however,  have followed my teaching, my  way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,      3:11 as well as the persecutions and sufferings  that happened to me in Antioch,  in Iconium, and in Lystra.   I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all.       3:12 Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.      3:13 But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse,   deceiving others and being deceived themselves.       3:14 You, however, must continue  in the things you have learned and are confident about. You know  who taught you       3:15 and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.       3:16 Every scripture  is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof,  for correction, and for training in righteousness,       3:17 that the person dedicated to God  may be capable  and equipped for every good work.

20090307213629AAWFvdl	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	What is Islamically wrong with what I am doing?	I myself was born and raised by two white British Muslims and I consider myself a Muslim. When I was very young I realised that I found other boys my age attractive and I knew I was not like other boys. Btw I was born with a gender disorder which was caused by Testosterone Deficiency in my mother’s womb (which modern scientists consider is one of the causes of homosexual feelings and effeminacy) and I to this day have Testosterone Deficiency Syndrome, so if you look that up you will realise that I have no sex drive.      When I was about 15 I became strongly attracted to my best friend, a fellow Muslim of Pakistani parents, we did everything together (except sexual acts) and I could not have asked to meet a more lovely person than him. Well I am 28 now, Inshallah in two weeks, and I live with that best friend 13 years later. He was FORCED into a marriage with his first cousin 5 years ago and he promised his parents he would divorce her if they made him marry her but to save his parents from shame he went ahead with the nikah and shaadi, 2 weeks later he divorced his cousin-wife and moved out of home to live with me. My mother loves him to bits and unfortunately my dad died 10 years ago but he loved him too. We bring out the best in eachother and have helped eachother through the deaths of both our fathers, my recurring depression and financial problems. So we resolved to share all our finances and bought a house in both our names 2 years ago. We read Namaaz/Salah together EVERY day at home and attend Jum’a at our local Mirpuri Mosque.      We DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT have sexual relations together, but we know that we LOVE eachother with all our hearts and would die for each other if need be.      I am sure 100% that I am not committing a sin with this person and I ask a sincere question to my fellow learned Muslim sisters and brothers, what is Islamically unlawful about my homosexuality? Btw, I have been to a psychiatrist and through counselling because of my depression which is in part due to the fact that I am not heterosexual and cannot be married and I have been told my 9 psychiatrists, yes 9, that homosexual feelings are NOT due to any psychiatric illness but that my Testosterone Deficiency Syndrome may be in part the cause, however that is irreversable, so I am stuck with being homosexual, if that is in fact what you can call be seeing as I have no desire to have sex.

Liberals like to say that this is all part of something they like to call "free speech," but the fact is that this stuff is harmful to our society, to our national pride, to our economy, and to our morality.  We will never move forward as a nation until we have purged this from our country along with abortion, homosexuality, and other godless things.        God did not intend for us to look at this stuff.  He wants us to keep our hearts and our minds clean.  But, of course, I probably can't expect godless atheists, pagans, humanists, and liberals to understand this.  They think we should just let people do watever they want.

I will soon be teaching Sunday school at my church on a rotational basis in a 4 & 5 year olds preschool classroom.  I have NO EXPERIENCE at this except to have been an observer in there one Sunday.  And that day there was one little boy, Zachary, who would not sit down and join the rest of the class.  He was extremely hyper.  And the teacher said he was having a calmer day--yikes!  After ample playtime, the rest of the kids were sitting at the table doing the lesson.  But Zachary was still bouncing around the room like a rubber ball.  While the rest of the kids folded their hands to pray, Zachary was crawling around under the table.  You get the picture.  My question is, what do you do with a kid like Zachary in Sunday school?  Let the behavior go?  Or sit on him and force him to participate?  (Tough to do--I tried.)  I realize it's just an hour of Sunday school--not that big a deal.  But shouldn't he be shown the right behavior for church?  How much disruption should be allowed at this age group?  Any suggestions or advice?  Thanks! :)

In a chatroom I said I liked guys who seem to be really good at one thing (some sort of talent from playing the sax to playing hockey or know computers), he immediate sent me a private message (in meebo).  the first thing he said in the private message (instead of the chatroom) was that "hey u said you liked guys with so and so and drop me a line".    Then he asked if he wanted me to see his art and what not.   He asked for my email within an hour or so of chatting with me online (i don't know with where this guy was from but he was really ticking me off).   I swear he wanted a romantic relationship and then i asked him why there was a need to rush into things and that he'll find a gal and just to be patient.   I went back to the chatroom and eventually I asked everyone else in there what it means when someone does that, and how I was talked off.  He then sent me another messsage asking why I was ticked off.  I answered, and I was like, "why would you want to be friends with me?  I mean shouldn't you try to gauge whether or not I am genuine before befriending me?".    I apologized and told him not to get offended.  He started to say whatever and to drop the subject.  He refused to answer why.  Then he said he wanted to be friends.  I told him i don't give email addresses online.  And that I would like to see his art without giving away email addresses.  He completely ignored me.

How did God establish a covenant with the people      Difference between Abrahams and Moses' covenant   For that question, I'll just take a go at it, and tell me if it's right   The difference is that Abrahams covenant, is that it only had one "commandment", just worship God, but in Moses, it had the 10, which includes caring for others too, not just god..?      Moses story and the giving of the ten commandments by god...?      If you can answer even one of these questions, that'd be GREATLY appreciated, thanks!

20090307211833AAZKAvK	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Defining race by individual appearance rather than genetics... Does one group do this more than others?	(I posted this question in another section but I think this one is more appropriate. So... )      I hate race labels period (esp. one-race labels for people from two races - it's a practice in segregation), but since they're there, why not use them correctly?      I've heard the words a person IS one race or the other because they LOOK like that race, even if the person has one parent from different races and carries the genetic markers (even those that aren't visible) of both races. If this person were found unidentified, their DNA would still reveal they are of both races. I've also heard they are one race or another based on how they're treated. But that would mean a person from a different race with physical resemblance would be treated the same way. Finally, a person labeling themselves based on what race they feel "comfortable" with, opens the door for miss-classification, medical dangers, and false claim to another race and history. Doesn't it also indicate society needs to change so that a person can feel "comfortable" being who they are (this is where I'm most concerned)?      This is all emotion-based rather than logical thinking.      Do you find people from one race use race labels according to "color", not "content", more than another (for instance, caucasians in America did so with the inaccurate "one drop" rule in the past)? Whom? And if so, why?      Also, since we have DNA evidence that disproves such illogical thinking, why does it continue?

Actually, I'm thinking I might be male (I'm anatomically female) but for now, I'm sticking with genderless.      I feel so liberated when people can't tell my gender. Sometimes people won't get it, and they'll call me he until someone corrects them. Then they'll be completely surprised.      I want to change my name. I want something gender-neutral, but dominantly male. I was thinking of either Ardan/Arlan or Dyl (but the spelling is subjective: Dyll, Dylle, Dil, Dill, etc... like the beginning of "Dylan" except only Dyl...)      I like Dyl better, but its too much of a nickname. But still, I like it better. And it fits my personality A LOT more. I also really like Ardan or Arlan. I can't decide...       Before I go to college, I plan to have learned whether or not I'm transgendered. I'm starting to think I am, but the fact that the male genitalia is absolutely disgusting to me makes me think that I'm not, haha.      ANYWAY. I want to change my name soon. It's Katie right now, which is doesn't fit my personality at all. And it's completely female.      The only thing is, I'd be very sad to give up the name my mother assigned me. And I think it'd disappoint my parents very much. Please advise me. I feel like I really can't have a gender-specific name. I'd like a unisex name that leans towards male, (Dyl, Ardan, Arlan) but how could I break it to my (VERY sensitive/sentimental) parents?

I know this sounds so wrong - that's why I have to vent about it over the internet, lol. I met an online friend. We've met in person alot. She's a woman as well, but I am almost 21 years younger than her. I'm 18. We've known each other for almost 3 years, but I've always felt that she wasn't honest about her sexuality even though she dates men, or at least to my knowledge. According to her Facebook, she likes both men & women. She's made suggestive comments before, and I've always thought she's liked me... but she talks about men, and will complain and rub it in my face - or so it seems. Other than that, she is a really nice person. I can't get over her. It makes it even worse because she is my best friend, and I'm always feeling depressed... I would be lost without her. I would love to tell her that I'm bisexual, but at the same time I don't want to scare her away if she doesn't know, or isn't interested. What should I do? Ugh.

20090307221142AATCdHD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Doesn't it take more faith to believe in evolution rather than God ?	Ok... there was a huge force of gravity which pulled everything in the universeto one place and then there was a rubber band effect which flung everything out in a giant explosion we call the Big Bang! Suddenly and randomly things formed and somehow life got on just one planet! Would'nt there be life on other planets to ? I mean sure they might just have carbon dioxide but why couldnt they just evolve into carbon dioxide breathing people hmmm!? Yeah there were volcanoes and they made the oceans. And then somehow a little speck came to life which eventually and randomly evolved into humans... and yet we see nothing evolving or nothing ever recorded to evolved. Somehow the earth was lucky enough to have a perfect atmosphere... and somehow we have a stronger magnetic field to keep out harmful sun rays then other planets ! but hey... it was chance!      In the beginning there was a God. We don't know where he came from because he is all powerful and greater then we can imagine. He created us perfectly and then we sinned which caused the fall. Therefore there is a creator and mankind and the universe is as it is now.      Now which ones more likely ?

Sometimes I feel ashamed of being black and wish I were some other colour.  Sometimes I even feel like black people don't treat each other with much respect...it just seems like to me that there are so many identity problems within the Black community and I wish it weren't there.  There are so many problems within Black famillies--many times a father is missing or there is physical abuse and cheating going on.   Why are we so broken?  I wish we were stronger, treat each other with respect and help each other out.   I think a lot of that goes back to slavery.  It's just this constantly hearing words and comments that Blacks are worthless and the lowest people of society...it sometimes seems like that Blacks bring that into their own families and treat each other with little respect.   I hope I make sense...I love my brown skin and I wish I were darker, but sometimes because of the many stereotypes I just feel like life would be easier if I weren't Black.

Then my little bro died so I went to New York for a while. When I came back my mom was dead and I was just there to bury her. Except one particular officer wanted to see me dead. This fool left me in a rival gang's territory with nothing(not even bus fair). After meeting up with an esse I find out this same homeboy is selling and killed my mom!

20090227115552AATqmWw	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Should whites switch to European American?	1977 Census was going to add European-American as an alternative to White      European-American would have been a definition more narrow than white that only refered to whites who are decendents of colonial Americans and the two major waves of European immigrants in the early 1900's.The term would combine a number of distinct ethnicities under a single rubric with origins in England. "Whites" would have been a broader term encompassing middle easterners, hispanics, eastern Europeans etc..       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Am...       Whites do you think you should go the European-American route because a Mexican, Saudi Arabian, and a English man are all considered "white".

20090308001030AABUrql	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: if you are so sure that God is not real, then why do you spend so much time trying to disprove him?	If you truly believed that God was not real, then you wouldn't need to spend so much time trying to disprove him.      Deep down, I know that God is truth. I do not need to waste my time trying to prove this. There is no need to try and dig up evidence for my claims, because I have faith and have no doubt in my mind. My consciousness is not clouded with falsehoods.      Atheists on the other hand, claim to be faithful in their belief that God is not real, yet they continue to try and dig up evidence to back up their claim. This is actually a sign of doubt. If you were positive with your assertions you wouldn't need to continuously try and find facts to prove yourselves, instead you would know that deep down he doesn't exist. You wouldn't have any doubt in your minds, but instead you do.      I would like to see an atheist respond to this seriously. I'm willing to debate on this. No immature answers please.

So I went on talking to my friend but when the guy came up to us and yelled boobs! and just walked off. So my question is - would this be considered sexual harassment? I have no idea what to do. He's done things like this in the past but when it was reported, nothing was done about it. If this happened last Friday, would it be too late to report it? Would it be okay if my friend was the only witness? Thanks so much! I'm sorry it was so long!

20090307230026AAxakRQ	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to cover up being "poor"?	I am who I am, and that's all that matters. I am poor, but I am still happy to be a part of this world.      But, to save my embarrassment, is there and way I can cover up being poor from my peers? I am 15 and in high school.      My mom and dad had me at 18 years old, I was pretty much an accident, although they call it a "surprise" (my ***). Anyways, once I was born, my mom could no long attend High School, so she dropped out. My dad had already dropped out the previous year, due to credit issues from his move from New York to Florida (where he met my mom) he got overwhelmed because he was required to take summer school and night school (kinda stupid on his part, but whatever). My mom later got her high school diploma, and my dad got his GED. Then they bore my first brother into the world in 1999.      So life went on, my mom became a dental assistant, and my dad owned his own business and life was good, and we had money.      But once my second and third brothers were born, it went downhill. My second brother was born in 2003, and my third in 2004.      We lost lots of money, my dad lost his business, and my mom quit being a dental assistant. we lost almost all money and were pretty much dirt poor.      We have since struggled and struggled. My mom recently got a degree as a licensed cosmetologist (she's wanted to do cosmetology for a very long time) and my dad is working small time at a restaurant.       We moved from Florida to Pennsylvania, and on top of missing my friends...I have not been adjusting well here in Clarks Summit Pennsylvania.       The people here are very wealthy, they have lots of money and most parents spoil their kids. I feel so singled out and lonely. Nobody else in my new school is poor. They are all really preppy and snooty because they have lots of money.      I really want to fit in, but I am afraid that I will be made fun of because of my lack of money.      The only reason we live in this richy place is because we just live in a small townhome community (the poor people)      I really want to fit in, but I am very nervous because of my financial situation.      Can someone please share some personal experiences to make me feel batter, and possibly cover up being poor in front of people.

20090227115658AAIqrDi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you know why people think the NWT is 'different'?	yes, i use the new world translation of the holy scriptures, but people keep telling me it is 'customized'      did you know that there are several ways of translating a language?      the king james version for example, is what is called a 'Dynamic' translation      The dynamic (also known as functional equivalence) attempts to convey the thought expressed in a source text.      therefore, it is more of what a translator thinks it is trying to say.      the new world translation is what is called a 'literal' translation.      so a literal translation is word for word, what the original text says it is.      but what i like about it, is that with some words, the translators knew that some words caused confusion. such as the word 'hell' in some translations. so, the translators did not translate the word at all. hence it speaking of 'sheol' instead of 'hell'.      so we can do research. as wikipedia (for example) says of the word      Sheol (pronounced "Sheh-ole")[1], in Hebrew ???Sheol'ol), is the "abode of the dead", the "underworld", or "pit".[2] Sheol is the common destination of both the righteous and the unrighteous dead, as recounted in Ecclesiastes and Job.      i am not bashing any translation at all, seeing as i frequently use the KJliterale GNB in my own study.      and my grandad (also a witness) has 30 translations of the 'old testimant' and 20 of the whole bible         so my question is, why do some people think the NWT is 'wrong' when it is a litteral translation;   and nothing has been added or taken away from it?

I have one teacher whom I still currently have (French, so consecutive years) and I had asked her last spring if I could use her as a job reference, of which she gladly said yes...

20080708103628AAjVddN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religiosos contesten esta...?	Por que la mayoria de las religiones dicen que Melquisedec, fue un rey parecido a Jesucristo, si ese rey fue un rey pagano, ademas adoraba primero a los hombres y despues a Dios. en  Genesis14-17-18 dice así.   YMelquisedec rey de salem sacó pan y vino y él era el sacerdote de del Dios Altísimo.Entonces lo bendijo y dijo.   "Bendito sea Abrahan del Dios Altísimo,   Y bendito sea el Dios Altísimo que ha entregado  a tus opresores en tu mano.   Acaso se debe adorar primero a los hombre y despues a Dios, Fue por esa causa que ya no pudo seguir con el sacerdocio,ni él ni sus descendientes.   Pero la mayoria de las religiones lo comparqan a Jesus  por que no tuvo principio ni fin, esa es una idea muy equivocada asi que estudien mas y aprendan.       entonces por que esa comparación con Jesucristo.

I'm 18 and he was my first boyfriend.      I am not a very stereotypical (I know stereotypes are rediculous but still) gay guy. I have a low voice and I've tried it before... but I feel rediculous trying to raise my pitch and trying to talk in a semi-lisp just to hint to a guy.     =  .  =      I'm a pretty normal looking guy. I don't like getting hung up on how I look, that is, i'm not very into fashion because it seems like it's kind of vein (spelling?).       One thing I have done for a while is worn tight pants. Its been my one way to try to hint. But with the increase of "scene" kids, it really isn't very effective.       I do my best to smile and be super friendly and go out of my way once I start talking to him to be outgoing buuut I am really introverted and it is so uncomfortable to me.    Sometimes because i'm so introverted I am perceived as either cold or uninterested, both of which are never true.       help? haha      as far as how I look, I don't really want to post a picture because I'm not open with very many people at all.      but I am 5 11 and weigh 165 lbs. I have a slim but tight body (hate to sound like im bragging haha but I feel I am a very healthy person). I have short brown/darkbrown hair that I kind push to the side a little. I wear beanies often and my hair comes barely out of it in the front. I wear normal fitting long sleeves, not tight not loose. And as i said tight jeans.      I'm not asking to be made into a stud :)   haha just asking for some pointers. If you read it all, you are f***ing sick with it ;)      and I'm sorry for my tendency to ramble

20090307233022AAsGQqa	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Homosexuality and Christianity.... God, shoot me already!!?	 http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c0...       I really don't know how to feel about this. I'm gay and I'm christian as well. I was raised in a Roman Catholic household with a straight upbringing. I hate it when people say homosexuality is a choice. Oh i would go through hell just to be straight. I don't necessarily believe in the Bible since it has been revised, edited, translated over and over and over for so many years [and I've found this site that proves the point].      I don't necessarily follow the bible but I go with my morals - right from wrong. I know it's wrong when it harms someone. I have faith in God and my faith and religion is my personal relationship to Him. Only He can judge me. I don't need some craptastic book written and translated by man (who could've been biased, i mean it's impossible to write anything that's biased) to tell me what I should and should not do.      I really don't know what to do or believe anymore. If I'm such a sin then just kill me already. Someone!! shoot me or whatever. Someone kill me before I commit "sin". Im young. Someone kill me for I might have a higher chance in heaven.

20090307233709AAfoGCA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is she straight or into me?!?	okay so i have a little issue... that i've kinda been having for at least two years now and still continuing. i have this friend that's really close to me. she says she's straight and all but if anyone ever asks her if she's into girls, she gets a little touchy. but when she's around me she always touches my legs, arms, hands. she leans on me all the time. sits on me and always tells me that she loves me. she's very flirtatious with me and gets really jealous when i talk about other girls that i like around her.       a recent account that i can give you guys is at a sweet sixteen i recently went to. it was her me and a bunch of other friends. my friends and i have a tendency to grind a lot. but with others they tend to hold back a little because they aren't as touchy feely. but when i danced with her she would put my hands on her hips. put her hands on my thighs, and things like that. she also started to dance with me face to face. she put her arms around my neck, and one of he legs between mine so that i would have one between hers. and she was looking into my eyes the entire time. and i had my hands on her hips and it didn't seem like he cared. but  when the song was over i went to go sit down because i was tired. she followed me and sat across my lap with one arm around my neck and her head on my shoulder. i was sitting next to this guy and he kept trying to touch me and she got very defensive. telling him to not touch me because she's kill him. then she pulled me back up to get away from him and started to dance with me again. but then i went to go sit down again since i was so tired. but after i got off the dance floor and sat down. i saw her walking over to me. she straddled me and started to give me a lap dance. going really slow and getting into it.       every time i see her she hugs me and tells me she loves me. and hell. i love her too, but i think i mean mine differently.       help please what do you guys think? any pointers on how to get an answer out of her without actually having to ask?

Before she married she was caring for her mother who is now 92. After mom moved away she depended on me to watch out for grandma. I am very close to grandma and didn't have a issue with this until I felt I was being taken for granted and everything I did had some fault to it. Grandma had a live in care provider for many years which required follow up visits and transportation when needed. I was the one who did all these things since my mother moved away with her husband. My mom has given my cousin second power of attorney if somethings happens to my mom who is Primary power of attorney. My cousin has no involvement with my grandma except on holidays. Recently grandma now has been moved into a nursing home that is a hour away from me. My mom expects me to obtain follow up visits weekly or more while keeping my own Personal life together. How I can I tell my mom I am there for all of them but cant continue with the expectations that this is my responsibility. My mother is also retired and has plenty of time on her hands

20090307161026AAo3USO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is one of my friend's church different than mainstream churches?	Instead of the practice of talking communion with bread and wine they have a monthly potluck. Is this what Jesus had intended? It seems to me that Jesus instituted this practice to be done as he done it without any variation. They also don't have a church building. There is only about twenty people who meet in a rented out room in a Chinese restaurant. In this room is a pool table and a whole bunch of board games. They don't sing hymns, but rather they sing modern day Christian music. Some of their ideas and ways of doing things are completely different than what I think Christianity consists of. The worst thing is that they claim that there methods are correct and everyone else in mainstream C is misguided. I know this because I went with my friend to their game night and I learned a little about their church. I just want to point out that I'm not saying they are wrong as I'm just saying that what they do is unfamiliar to me.

20090307161957AANJTz8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	In the Roman Catholic Church, does Canon Law interpret Divine Law?	In another question about Divine Law and Canon Law, I got this response: "Divine Law is eternal. Divine Law is of course supreme.   Canon Law is the interpretation of Divine Law for the benefit of man and our daily obligations."      I thought that Canon Law dealt with the governance of the Roman Catholic Church (how it is administered). This suggests that Canon Law also interprets Divine Law? Is this correct?

20090307162028AAF94pj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is christianity a corrupt religion?	just so you know. i am a christian. but would like an educated christian to answers these questions?      it says in the bible to not judge, but yet all you do is judge homosexuals and deny the right to giving them something you do not fully understand.      why is it that everytime a question of decency occurs, instead of usuing your common sense and logically thinking of how the situation can hurt others, you instead look into your bible and try to find nill evidence that it is right or wrong (i.e. masturbation)      Why is dressing up nicely to go to church an assumption but opening the door for an old lady or saying thank you on the phone not?      btw, a priest prophesized before i was born that i would be a boy and i would grow up to be a bishop. the strange thing is i question everything in our religion.

20081216124409AArnvf5	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why are my neighbors so unfriendly?	I live in an apartment and I always say hi to my neighbors and they never say hi back and are such snobs! I cant even make small talk with them without being snobs. Some are my age in their early 20's and some are older people and even the older people like in their late 60s or old ladies, god they are the worst! So one time I am coming out of my apartment and this old lady hag that lives next door to me looked so paranoid and when I walked past her apartment because I had to leave my apartment, she slammed the door so loud and not just locked it but she put up a chain!!! and she kept opening the door and being nosy everytime I would walk past.      Also, one time the smoke alarm went off and it was coming from that same old lady so I politely knocked on her door and she answered it and asked: "WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" And I said: "im sorry to bother you maam but I live next door to you and the smoke alarm is going off and it is coming from your apt and I want to know if you are ok and there is no fire." and she slams the door hard again right in my damn face!!!!! it was that hard that if my face would have been any closer that she could have broke my nose!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ow!!!!!!!!!!!! and again she locks it hard and hammers bolts in it from what it sounded like and I am thinking: "Jez you stupid f**king old cripple b**ch!!!! I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP AND BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR!! STUPID PARANOID WOMAN!!" So I am so afraid now to call my neighbors if I ever need help or even say hi to them.      Even this sweet young cute college girl that lives on my floor sees me and I never bother her and invade her privacy unless I asked if I can borrow some kind of cart to carry my groceries with or laundry and same thing:!! "She slams the door in my face and never answers the door when I am there!!!" What is with people?!!" I am not a stranger, I am their neighbor!!! Cant we just be friendly and say hi to each other and talk? How can I go about this?

20081102152810AA3TEJn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Racism question. White and black?	This is probably going to spark some type of argument, and that's not what I want at all. I want to politely and agreeably discuss/debate why one form of racism is unacceptable, but the other is allowed.      Why is it SO horrible when a white person degrades a black person, but no one says anything when a black person degrades a white person?      Why is there a United ***** College fund JUST for black people, but there is no United Caucasian College fund JUST for white people?      Just wondering. It's the exact same thing, but the shoe is on the other foot and no one seems to notice.      * Also, many believe that it is this way because black poeple used to be enslaved...      NEWS FLASH: That was long ago. Not one black person in America has been enslaved in their lifetime (unless they are very VERY VERY old), so why even bring that up again? It has no place...      This is what I think. What do you think?

20090307160618AASR1hC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Major Help Please.......?	Ok so I'm 17 and totally gay. Most people know I'm out and dont have any sort of problem with it. Recently in January I started working at my new job. I work with kids and absolutely love it. Anyways, there was another girl that worked there and up until about two weeks ago, I thought she was completely straight. But it turns out she's bi. I've thought she was cute ever since I first saw her and we've only gotten closer since then. Now normally I have no problem going for the girl. But this girl happens to be 22 and has three kids. I've always been attracted to girls in trouble. They're my weakness. And I can feel myself falling for her. theres no possible way it could work. I forgot to mention, I'm in the Coast Guard and I ship out in August. So thats also an issue. But we both like each other a lot. And I know it could end really bad. I need help majorly. I have no clue what to do. Should I stick it out and see what happens? Should I make a move? Or should I just back off completely and let it go? Please help the best you can and dont hate on me or anything. I just need advice.
