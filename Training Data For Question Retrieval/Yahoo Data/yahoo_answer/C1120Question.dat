Ever since I was little I always went to this Barber shop in our town to cut my hair, well Im getting sick of it because every time I come out of there my hair looks like ****.  Everyone always tells me how my haircut looks like a 5 year old haircut. HELP!      My hair currently is semi-long. My bangs reach into my eyebrows and my sides almost go over my ears. My hair is way straight and a semi-dark brown to go with my brown eyes. People tell me that my eyes are my greatest asset and having long bangs does nothing for me.       So I have been trying to look for new looks, short and simply but still styled and neat. Im a athletic/preppy type of person, so please no emo/punk stuff.       Any ideas? Pictures, thoughts, advice, tips to style, products. Anything! Thanks for your help.

IN OTHER WORDS: is it not a very good and steady job? What schools would you recomend? I found a cool school but of course it was in LA and im from a very small town in Indiana and am worried about where I would live and how i would have money for living (stuff like that)... I've already been in college for a while and have decided that a regular job is not for me! (i was going for nursing) and although i was getting straight A's, i just want an awesome, unique job where I can dress how ever I want ever day, have tattoo's, and just look good period! lol any information for me at all would help me so greatly! Personally i hate the idea of any school because how is anyone suppossed to know what they want to do for the rest of their life if they've never really done it? so if anyone out there IS an actual makeup artist I would love to know about your job in more detail! where you work, what exactly you do, your hours...ect.. Thank you so much ahead of time!

20090222215201AAKYQRp	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Copying tattoo question..?	Basically, i was planning on getting my ribs tattooed  with holy trinity in latin..then one day i cam across a picture of the actor Cam Gigandet..i noticed he had a hip tattoo that says Godspeed in a banner right above his oblique.. when i saw this i thought the banner idea on the hip was a much better location for a number of reasons..I still want the holy trinity but i would like to change it from my ribs to the banner on the hip instead. It would obviously not say Godspeed..and it wouldn't be in english and it would be in a diff font..the question i had was if copying the banner and placement of Gigandets tattoo would be not a cool thing to do because he has it already..so really what im asking is if copying the location and banner would be seen as "low" because not the WHOLE tattoo was my Original idea.thanks,

I normally always straight iron it. Should I go into the salon w/ my hair how it is if I don't straighten it? Would it help the stylist to be able to get a better idea of how to cut my hair?

Basically i've got a couple of questions (please can the "judgemental" refrain from posting 'should have thought about that before you got it done' - we all make mistakes and i'm just looking for a bit of advice).      1) i know i'm gona have to keep the treated tattoo protected from the sun through say factor 50 sunblock, but can i put fake tan on so it doesn't look completely odd next to the tanned skin? and after a month or so can you use factor say 30?      2) Would dermablend cover the tattoo and stay on when swimming and surfing?      Thanks in advance for any constructive advice!

At first it did the trick, I was less flaky but now it's starting up again. I've also tried the Dove shampoo and conditioner for colored hair and that also seemed to still give me flakes. I think it's the shampoo that's possibly giving me problems so I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on gentler shampoo. Maybe ones with less chemicals?

20090222161403AAnHjxO	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Where can I buy a burgundy military coat with silver metal work/buttons?	Hi,   I have a thing for interesting coats and I saw a girl down the street wearing this (damn i should have asked her where she got it from!).  It's kinda in a Karen Millen style with the smart metal studs/buttons and is slightly flared at the end but I haven't seen it on their website so I don't think it's from there.   Any other suggestions about beautiful coats are welcome.  I am petite and love interesting ones with designs/appliques or ones with bows/bustles at the back.      thanks   xxxx

20090222161616AAcqYFs	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	I have chronically chapped lips that I can't stop picking at. Please help!?	My bottom lip is horribly chapped. It's seriously like one giant scab, and I always pick at it! I know that it's really gross, but I can't help it. It's sort of an OCD type thing. I put on a lot of chapstick and vaseline, but that doesn't really help... I do have certain times when I can get myself to stop for a couple weeks and my lips become healthy and pretty again, but I always end up picking at them again. I've had it for over 6 months now, and I hate it so much, it makes me feel really ugly and weird when I think about it.   I don't even know what to do to start helping this problem. All I can think of is to put more and more chapstick on, but again, that doesn't work.   I know this is a weird situation, but does anyone have any ideas at all? I'm really desperate, I'll do anything. PLEASE HELP!
20090222161616AAK9ccF	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Went in a tanning bed for the first time today- did i do everything right?	Let me start off-   I KNOW I CAN GET CANCER. DO NOT WARN ME.   Ok so I used a bed.   I have fairly light skin and i burn easily.   I used australian gold kiss kiss tanning lotion.   I went in for 8 minutes completely naked.   I used goggles that do not have straps on them. Is this ok? I bought them.   I felt slightly warm, and i dont think i used the fan?      can someone evaluate my experience and tell me what to do different tommorow?
