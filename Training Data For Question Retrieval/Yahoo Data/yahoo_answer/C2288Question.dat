I knew that people would put Paul Revere! actually, he has nothing to do with america's independence!! LOL!!!!      Ceaser Rodney has been lost/forgotten in many of our history areas and minds. without him, frankly, there would be no america's independence.      we forgot how much some of these guys went through for america's independence.. like Ceaser Rodney, he had cancer!! He wore this black patch across half of his face cause the cancer was eating away his face, yet, a good friend of his, got him on a horse, and send him back to delaware, to die in his hometown. Rodney wanted to die in his home bed. so on his deathbed, he lies. meanwhile, back in philedelphia, the congress needed his vote to declare independence. without Rodney's vote, there is no independence. no one challenges Rodney. So they went back to philedelphia and rodney got his vote in.

20070424173854AAR70bk	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Caltech, MIT, or other engineering?	Hello. I am currently a freshman in high school, and would like to start working on my future. I know I still have a very long way to go, and things could change, but I would like some opinions. I live in the nicer suburbs of western Chicago, to give you a little bit of background info. I am in the highest classes in high school I can be in (all honors) and am getting A's in all of them. I am hoping/going to be taking the highest courses possible through out high school (AP, or honors when ap is not available). I work hard and want to do well. I also am involved in extracircullar activities also: math team, musical, student council, and playing the piano (and some other lesser stuff). I have visited Caltech and loved the area. I have been to CA a few times also and love it there (I probably want to live there). My question is what college would better suit me...Caltech, MIT, or something else. At this time, I am interested in Aeronautical or Mechanical Engineering. Thanks

It has been almost 3 years since I started Capella and it didn't have such a bad reputation back then. I am currently working as an Underwriting Assistant at a small insurance company. My goal is to become an underwriter with a major company. My question is, did I screw up by attending Capella, and if so is there anything I can do to fix it? Should I go back to school? I'm looking for serious answers from people who have been in my situation before or who have gone to online schools and have received job offers. I have been working as an underwriting assistant for close to a year. In the next month or so I wanted to begin searching for a new position with a bigger company, but I am scared that I will be rejected due to my education choices. Any Advice?

20070626190502AAvGuly	Education & Reference;Other - Education	De dónde proviene el nombre Venezuela?	En la escuela siempre nos han ense?ado que "Venezuela" proviene de Venecia, que cuando Colón llegó aquí en su tercer viaje vio palafitos sobre el agua y le dio ese nombre.      Sin embargo, otros dicen algo bastante parecido pero que Venezuela es un peyorativo de Venecia (como mujerzuela es a mujer) debido que cuando colón llegó a Paria el color turbio del agua y efectivamente los palafitos (poco majestuosos comparados con la arquitectura veneciana) dispuso entonces del nombre despectivo: Venezuela.      Aguien sabe algo más? qué mas hay acerca de este tema?

20080927074900AA3xPqM	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Why does the news always use the term "battle with cancer"?	Like, whenever someone dies from cancer, it seems the news always says, "Blah blah blah died from a lengthy battle with cancer." , "...short battle with cancer.", "After battliing with cancer for blah blah blah years, ..."      Um.  It's a disease.  It would probably be better not to battle it, cause it's going to bite back.  I don't think those people wanted to waste their time battling with cancer.  They just HAD cancer.  They dealt with it as best as they could.  Maybe they got some of it removed from their body.  Maybe things were cut out, maybe it got a bit gory, but this whole "battle" seems like a bad joke.  I bet half of the people that write this stuff aren't even thinking about their choice of words.      If I die from cancer, don't say I battled with it.  I just HAD fracking cancer and eventually I died.  That's life.  I did my best, I lived well, then I frackin died.
20081119191642AAXDsJD	Education & Reference;Teaching	What is the best solution to this teaching problem?	Hola,      I have my degree in Spanish, and I am working on teaching credentials, and praying that no one from my school is reading this, or at least, that they won't guess my name.     Right now, I'm teaching Spanish, but I'm not a permanent teacher but a substitute teacher.  I've taken over three classes of Spanish at a high school.  The permanent teacher is ill, and will be out for the rest of the semester.  I speak Spanish fluently and I have experience teaching, but there are some problems.       I thought it would be a really good opportunity but I feel like I'm failing.     The problem is, that I just cannot seem to control the classes and the students are out of control. In every single class, the students talk, and scream, and nothing I seem to do gets their attention.  I wait for them to get quiet, I ask for their attention, and it's like I'm not even there.  I've tried writing them up, but when they see me writing their names down, they threaten me and try to snatch my notebook out of my hands, and say things like, "You better not be writing my name down."  Today, I asked a student to please not talk when I was talking, and she said, "You're a liar."  I sent her out of the class but she sat there and refused for about 10 minutes.  The administration barely helps, either (I've spoken to them).        We have rules at our school about the dress code, no cell phones, pagers are allowed.  We're supposed to confiscate them and write a referral.  Yesterday, I spoke to all my students in first period, and I reminded them that we have a rule about cell phones, I realize you don't like it... but it's not my rule.  I told them that I didn't want to see cell phones or pagers out, ever again.        Today, a student had her cell phone and I told her to put it away, and she screamed, "Shut the f*ck up!  You're not a REAL teacher!"  I wrote a discipline referral and sent her to the office.      What's wrong with me that I have this effect on people?     The students had a really good rapport with their former teacher... they would tell her they loved her and bring her gifts.  But, they seem bound and determined to make me die of heart failure.  I have chest pains every day, and I am in real physical danger.         They'll stand there and call me a *****, call me stupid, and a liar to my face.        I realize there are worse problems in the world, but I want to do a good job, like I promised I would... and I would like to live to see my 30th birthday but I'm gonna have a heart attack soon.  Above all, I don't want to fail.      Is it just a lack of interpersonal intelligence?  The kids are awful, but what REALLY confuses me is that they have such a great rapport with the other teacher.  The other teachers admit the kids are bad, but they don't have the problems I do.      Calling the parents, writing referrals, sending them out of the room or to the office doesn't have any effect.      If you can help me, thank you!       :)

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP!               Here's the verse:       1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning.       3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood[a] it.       6There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. 7He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. 8He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.[b]       10He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— 13children born not of natural descent,[c] nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.

20080515120046AAwtIdW	Education & Reference;Teaching	I bambini a cui sono state lette tante favole ad alta voce imparano a leggere prima degli altri?	I bambini a cui sono state lette tante favole ad alta voce hanno una maggiore proprietà di linguaggio e imparano a leggere prima degli altri. Lo ha dimostrato una ricerca condotta negli Stati Uniti nell'ambito del "The Reach Out and Read Programme"; i risultati di questo studio sono stati pubblicati on-line sulla rivista Archives of Disease in Childhood.       La lettura ad alta voce nei bambini in età prescolare stimola la curiosità e facilita l'acquisizione dei concetti di tempo, di spazio e di ruoli. Ascoltare per i bambini è anche un ottimo esercizio ad acquisire la capacità di ascolto e a sviluppare l'attenzione e la concentrazione. Inoltre avere familiarità con i libri aiuta i bambini ad amare la lettura e a portarsi dietro questa bella abitudine per il resto della vita       Qualche consiglio per i genitori per aiutarli a scegliere le letture giuste.    Prima di tutto non scegliete dei libri che non vi piacciono, i bambini se ne accorgerebbero subito e non si lascerebbero rapire dal racconto. Allo stesso tempo, però, tenete in considerazione i gusti dei vostri figli; anche se piccoli esprimono chiaramente l'apprezzamento o il rifiuto per una storia.    è importante creare anche un'atmosfera, un ambiente adatto alla lettura: confortevole, intimo, caldo e rilassante. è anche molto importante fare in modo che il momento della lettura sia rituale e che crei l'aspettativa e la voglia di sapere come una storia procede o va a finire.       Fonte: Children better prepared for school if their parents read aloud to them. Review published on line ahead of print in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.

20081002220412AAoVvs4	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	If improvement from 3.7 during senior year, Ivy Leagues/equivalent level still possible?	I'm a senior student now, and my level of classes has always been the highest ones accessible at the respective grades. But during my sophomore and junior years, I had a lot of health problems and some lack of motivation, so I ended up with a D in English 3 Honors last year and total I have a rather unimpressive weighted GPA of about 3.7, and I'm ranked 102 out of a little over 600 in my class. Hopefully I can offset the GPA with my qualitative essays and recommendations, and I'm currently making up the credit for that D in night classes, though I'm not sure if that will actually overwrite my grade.      I'm currently taking AP Calculus BC, AP English 4, AP Economics (1st semester), AP Government (2nd semester), AP Biology, and AP Japanese 4. If I manage to get all A's in these classes during the first semester, will colleges still consider them after I apply? I know admissions officers like to see improvement, but I've always heard this mentioned in the context of sophomore to junior year. Specifically, do colleges just throw out your report if the GPA doesn't meet a certain requirement, giving you no chance even if you show tremendous improvement with the same level of classes during your senior year?      OTHER INFO:   Dream schools: Yale, Stanford    Target schools: UCLA, UC Berkeley, University of Wisconsin Madison   Safe schools: as of yet undecided      I scored 2230 on the SAT, and I plan to submit three SAT-IIs that I have scored high 700s or 800 on. I scored 4 on AP World History, US History, and Chemistry. I scored 5 on AP Physics and Music Theory.

A little boy goes to his dad and asks, 'What is Politics?'       Dad says, 'Well son, let me try to explain it this way:       I am the head of the family, so call me The Prime Minister.       Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her the Government.       We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you the People       The nanny, we will consider her the Working Class.       And your baby brother, we will call him the Future.       Now think about that and see if it makes sense.'       So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.       Later that night,! he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him.       He finds that the baby has severely soiled his nappy.       So the little boy goes to his parent's room and finds his mother asleep.       Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny.      He gives up and goes back to bed       The next morning, the little boy says to his father,   'Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now. '       The father says, 'Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.'       The little boy replies, 'The prime Minister is screwing the Working Class while the Government is sound asleep.   The People are being ignored and the Future is in deep ****.'      Star this if you think it is funny

20090102222211AA9Lnwt	Education & Reference;Homework Help	?Como compensar falta de preparacion universitaria,soy empirico.?	Por razones estrictamente economicas tuve que abandonar mis estudios universitarios cuando apenas empezaba, jamas corone una carrera, o trabajaba o estudiaba, no podia hacer ambos, sólo me quede con un tecnico medio en computacion, con eso emprendi un largo camino de 14 a?os ya en este ramo, computacion, soy tecnico medio, sin embargo, mucha gente no lo sabe y asumen que soy Ing. o  Lic. y me llaman asi. Por mi propia capacidad, auto estudio y simple observacion he logrado dominar bastante bien los conocimiento de mi oficio, programo sistemas, manejo todo lo relacionado a hardware, manejo software, un poco de todo, me he hecho en la calle como dicen en mi pais, si me mido a un jovencito recien salido de la U posiblemente lo voy a superar en cuestiones practicas pero en temas teoricos me quedaria corto, sólo aprendi lo basico para trabajar, resolver y llevar el pan a casa, claro soy bueno en lo mio pero soy empirico, ahora tengo 34 a?os, cuando intente estudiar una carrera a los 20 no pude, ahora con familia, grandes deudas, responsabilidades pienso que me seria muy dificil de emprender una carrera, ademas tengo 14 a?os de no estar en una aula, de no atender una clase de nada, solo me he dedicado a subsistir, mi pregunta es: es posible que a travez del autoestudio pudiera llegar a estudiar, leer, experimentar, practicar y formarme a tal punto que pudiera compensar lo mas posible el no haber pasado por la universidad especificamente en el campo de la computacion, si esto es posible, cuales serian los temas especificos que yo deberia ahondar, investigar, leer y manejar como base teorica, hablo de lo puntal, ya que en la U un alto porcentaje de lo que se estudia es cultura general, cual seria lo mas practico de este oficio, lo mas elemental de manejar, podria alguien darme esta informacion, o de plano estoy diciendo una locurita o sólo en la U se puede llegar a dominar la teoria.

I'm in my senior year of college, and this recent summer, I did research for a professor (she). I did really well, and we got along, and she liked me very much, said I did very well. I thus asked her to write a letter of recommendation for me, in support of my application to graduate school next year, which I am preparing right now. I asked her during the last few weeks I worked with her, in early September, and told her that it's no rush, since the deadlines are December. Well, it's getting close to there. We're in different cities, so I've talked to her through e-mail, and she says she'll "get right on it" asap, since she has grant apps for her own research and stuff. But now I'm slightly nervous and angry, since I did give her a full three months, and I believe this letter will make or break my application (I really do believe she will write a wonderful reference for me). So I need to push her for the letter. But how do I do so? Do I have the right, giving her all this time?

20061209100430AADuUgl	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Ist das alles Fehlerfrei?	Sehr geehrter Herr Schulleiter,         Und zwar habe ich Sommer 05 mein Realschulabschluss an der Hauptschule in Bad Gandersheim gemacht und den mit dem Noten Durchschnitt von 2,6 bestanden.      Jetzt habe ich in der zeit dazwischen 1 Jahr Informatik in Winsen Luhe and der Berufsschule gemacht und momentan mache ich FOS-T in der 11. Klasse aber ich habe aus Zufall erfahren das man mit einem Realschulabschluss auch an ein Gymnasium direkt gehen kann.   Der Wille zum Lernen ist  jedenfalls da und Disziplin steht bei mir an erster Stelle.   Der Grund das ich damals auf die Hauptschule gekommen bin war der das ich in Deutsch nicht gut war weil ich aus dem Libanon neu nach Deutschland gekommen bin.      Jetzt bin ich mittlerweile schon 19 Jahre alt geb. 06.07.1987.     Im Sommer 07 würde ich gerne auf ein staatliches Gymnasium gehen um das allgemeine Abitur zu erlangen und nicht wie ich bis jetzt vor hatte didie Fachhochschulreife.      über eine Positive Antwort würde ich mich sehr freuen.
