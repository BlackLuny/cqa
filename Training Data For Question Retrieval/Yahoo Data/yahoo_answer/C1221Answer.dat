3eIuXzrAaa	Make a drawing of the shape and you should be able to formulate the question better. Maybe you'll be able to figure it out yourself by just looking at the drawing :)    If i have understood correctly then lateral area is the total surface area minus 2 times the area of the base.    The area of the base is given by the length of the base squared since you told me that the base is a square. Thus we get the following equation where X is the length of the base:    2X^2 + 192 = 264    2X^2 = 264 - 192    X^2 = (264 -192) / 2    X = square root of ((164 - 192) / 2)    X = 6           (that's a nice number :D )    But let me know if i did something wrong.

6WpIS5M6aa	Begin by drawing  sketch. I find this always helps a bit.    (a) Find radius & centre  coordinates  We will do this by completing the square, in order to get the given equation in  Standard Form, (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2=r^2  x^2+y^2-18x-6y+45=0  x^2 -18x+ ?  +y^2-6y+ ?? = -45 +? +??  x^2-18x+81 + y^2-6y+9= -45+81+9  (x-9)^2 + (y-3)^2=45  Centre is (h,k), r^2=45  -h=-9, so h=9  -k=-3, so k=3  Required centre is (9,3)  Radius = sq.rt.(45), =3rt(5)    (b) Show y=2x is tangent to C, and find coordinates Q, its point of contact  The line from the centre (3,6) to Q will be perpendicular to y=2x. [It's a fact that  a radius meets a tangent's contact point at 90 degrees]  The equation of this line from (3,6) to Q will have the form   y=mx+b  m. is the negative reciprocal of the slope of its perpendicular, y=2x. That will  be -1/2  So we have y= (-1/2)x+b  Since this line passes through (3,6)  6=(-1/2)(3)+b  6+3/2=b  12/2+3/2=b  15/2=b  y= (-1/2)x+15/2 is the equation of our line from (9,3) to Q  Write this as   2y= -x+15  Find intersection point Q by solving the system  2y= -x+15  y=2x  Substitute 2x for y into Equation 1, to get  4x+x=15  5x=15  x=3  Since y=2x, y=2(3), =6  Q has coordinates (3,6)     (c)Show tangent to C at point R (6,9) has equation x-2y+12=0  The slope of the line from centre (9,3) to R, (6,9) is   m=(9-3) / (6-9), =6/-3, =-2  The tangent's slope is therefore 1?2  Its equation is y = (1/2)x+b  It passes through (6,9)  9=(1/2)6  +b  9=3+b  9-3=b  6=b  The tangent's equation is y= (1/2)x+6  Multiply by 2  2y=x+12, or   0=x-2y+12    (d) y=2x meets x-2y+12=0 at S, show QS=rt(5)  Coordinates of intersection found by solving the system  y=2x  2y=x+12  Substituting 2x for y in second equation gives  2(2x)=x+12  4x-x=12  3x=12  x=4  Since y=2x, y=8  Coordinates are (4,8)  Now use the Distance Formula  QS^2=(8-6)^2+(4-3)^2  QS^2=4+1  QS^2=5  QS=rt(5)    In reviewing this response to you, I see that you were asked to prove that the  line y=2x is a tangent to C, and I have told you that it's a fact that tangents  and a circle's radius meet at 90 degrees.  I've not answered this part properly. My apologies.    Good luck to you|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	pay attention in class dude

8Y7LQ6TGaa	By "background radiation" I assume you mean thermal radiation.    It's very location specific. In a large city, it can be significant, the equivalent of 5 deg F. But that is mixed with temperature increase due to convection, and sorting those out would be difficult.    Outside a city, away from any houses, it's too small to measure.      Or do you mean ionizing radiation, such as from nuclear reactions, isotopes, etc?      In this case, it again is location and incident dependent. If you have a dental X-ray, that causes an increase in radiation seen by your body. If you work in a Nuclear power plant or similar, you will see a small increase in radiation. But outside of those, you will not see any increase.    .|`|4c2daec05f4f88483fd1490ee194945aaa	If you mean ionizing radiation, in most locations it's too small to measure.  Yes, it's much higher when you receive an xray diagnosis, but even that is getting much smaller with modern electronic detectors instead of photographic film.  If you receive radiation therapy, such as for cancer, it is very much higher, but localized.    Now that radium is no longer used to make watch and clock dials glow, the greatest environmental source is probably improper disposal of smoke detectors.  With good equipment and careful measurement techniques, you could probably measure a slightly higher radiation level outside the fences of a fission power plant.    Before modern controls were in place, haphazard treatment of uranium mining byproducts and spent fuel, and inadequate attention to worker safety produced dangerous and unnecessary exposure.  That was decades ago.    The main sources now are cosmic rays and ground minerals.
eug6CIMZaa	First, a little background information clarification...There is a difference between ionic compounds and polar compounds. An ionic bond is between two atoms, such as with table salt, NaCl that dissociates when placed in a polar solvent, such as water. The water molecule is polar because the charges on the molecule are not even, the oxygen atom is slightly negative, while the hydrogen atoms is slightly positive. When the NaCl molecule breaks up, it forms two ions, Na+ and Cl-. The negatively charged oxygen molecules are attracted to the positively charged Na+, and visa versa for hydrogen and Cl. The attraction of the charges on the polar solvent, water, is what causes the ionic compound to dissociate.     So, the dissociated ions in the water cause a positive/negative gradient, which allow the electricity to flow freely through the solution (ie conducts electricity).     Think about it this way, even though water is a polar molecule, it does not conduct electricity because there is no gradient, the positive and negative charges between the atoms (hydrogen bonds) are all mixed up.      Good luck, hope this helps!

gZPxJpSVaa	Silver fluoride is soluble in water, so using silver nitrate won't show  the presence of fluoride the way it will with other halides.  However,  calcium fluoride in insoluble in water.  So you can use a solution  of calcium nitrate or calcium chloride to test for presence of fluoride.  If fluoride is present, a precipitate of calcium fluoride, CaF2, will form.  To confirm, you can filter the precipitate and test it with sulfuric acid  to see if it emits vapors of hydrogen fluoride, HF.  That's about the best test I can suggest for the presence of fluoride.
xXOnjDNOaa	Accuracy is how close a measured value is true value, precision is how close a measured value is to other values obtained by the same technique.      An example might be cooking:  Say every week you make cookies, and the recipe calls for a cup of sugar.  If you bought 5 pounds of sugar (10 cups) you'd end up making 10 batches of cookies with it, working out to one cup per batch pretty accurately (the measured value was close to the theoretical value).  However, your measuring cup probably only gives measurements up to the 1/4 cup range, so on any given batch of cookies you may have used 1 cup plus or minus let's say, 1/8 of a cup (since you're eyeballing that part of the measurement). So for any given batch of cookies, you might have anywhere from 7/8 of a cup to 1 and 1/8 of a cup of sugar, the precision of your measuring the sugar is +- 1/8 cup.

cJPOs7Tsaa	Assuming he's in the center of a tightly packed group of barnacles that are all the same size, then let's assume this diameter is 1.  I am also assuming that barnacles are hermaphrodites (possessing both sex organs), otherwise the answers I've posted will be roughly half, obviously.    1) 34  The outermost circle has a diameter of 11. (He's has a reach of 5, in any direction, plus his own diameter, right?) So, to answer this, lets calculate the circumference of the outermost circle: pi x 11 = 34.56. Since all the barnacles have a diameter of 1, then there must be 34 that the lucky guy in the center can reach.    2) 107  Using the above logic, calculate the number of barnacles in each concentric circle, rounding down for each circle.  pi(11)+pi(9)+pi(7)+pi(5)+pi(3)  = 34+28+21+15+9  = 107    *note pi(7) = 21.99... take it as 22, if you like to think that one extra barnacle will squeeze in there, in which case the answer to  2 would be 108. For that matter, why not assume that there are a number of smaller barnacles packed into the nooks and crannies, in which case you can round ALL the pi calculations up instead of down. In which case the answer to  1 would be 35, and  2 would be 112.|`|OcCgUsmLaa	I suppose it depends on how much stamina he has.     Go little barnacle........go.      S

The electron count will be the same to balance out the charge.

The difference in mass of lead oxide and plain lead is 0.48 gram  so the 3.11 grams of lead was combined with 0.48 gm. of oxygen.  The atomic weight of lead is 207.2 and that of oxygen is 16.  To find the atomic ratio, divide the mass of each element by its  atomic weight.  For lead, we get 3.11/207.2 = 0.015  and for oxygen we get 0.048/16 = 0.03  The quotients (0.015 and 0.03) have the ratio one to two, so for  each atom of lead we originally had two atoms of oxygen.  Thus the formula is PbO2 - lead dioxide.  Hope this answers your question.|`|pSOQTumdaa	the mass of the lead oxide present in the tube is 3.59 g.  the mass of Pb left after combustion is 3.11 g.  simple subtraction.  the amount of oxygen released is 0.48 g    lead oxide + O2 --> 3.11 g Pb + 0.48 g O2    3.11 g Pb / 207.2 g/mole = 0.015 moles Pb produced  0.48 g O2 / 32 g/mole = 0.015 moles O2 produced  therefore, for every mole oxygen produced, a mole of Pb is produced.  lead oxide  --> Pb + O2  in a balanced equation, the moles of Pb must be the same as the moles O2 produced.  Therefore  Pb2O4  --> 2Pb + 2O2

It happens in September, too.|`|LRH9Em0yaa	You have asked a very cool question.  Now I am going to ask you one.  Did you  know that the Earth is a big round planet that travels through space around  the sun?  Besides our Earth traveling around the sun, it also spins around  one whole time every single day.    Now imagine yourself outside.  Mom is standing in front of you and dad is  behind you.  Now spin.  When you spin, sometimes you can see dad and not  mom.  Sometimes mom and not dad.  But both of them are always there.  Same  thing with us and the sun.  In the day time we are facing towards the sun  and at night we are not.  The sun is there, we just cannot see it from where  we are.  When it is night time here it is day time on the opposite side of the  Earth and all those kids are up and playing.    Now the moon travels around us just like we travel around the sun.  It is on  a totally different time schedule.  It takes us (on the earth) one year,   (365 days), to  make the trip around the sun, but it only takes the moon 28 days to make the  trip around the Earth.  So sometimes during the day we can see the moon  because it is just moving around us faster.    Ask mom or dad to take you to the library to get some really cool books on  the Solar System.  They will probably have good explanations along with some  really neat pictures.    Good luck on your planetary adventure.    Mrs. Croll  ======================================...  Nicholas,  What we call day is the part of the time when we can see the sun.  What we  call night is the part of the time we cannot see the sun.  This is because  daylight comes from the sun.    Sometimes the moon is close to the sun.  This is when you see the moon  during the day but not at night.  Sometimes the moon is very far from the  sun.  This is when you see the moon at night but not during the day.  Sometimes the moon is in between:  part of the day and part of the night.    Dr. Ken Mellendorf  Physics Instructor  Illinois Central College  ======================================...  Remember, the earth revolves about the sun, and the moon revolves  around the earth. Also the earth spins on its axis, like a spinning ball. If  we are on the side facing the sun, the sun shines. If you are on the side  facing away from the sun, it is dark. Because both the earth and moon are  revolving around the sun, there are times when sunlight shines on both. You  can see this by taking a flash light (the sun) and shining it on two  balls -- say a golf ball (or marble), and a baseball or soccer ball (the  earth). Put an 'X' on the earth (that is you) and let it turn around. You  will see that sometimes the 'X' is in the light and sometimes it is not  (that is, day and night). Then let the smaller ball move around the larger  ball. You can see then that sometimes it and the 'X' are in the sun light,  one is in the sunlight and the other is not, or neither the "moon" nor the  'X' are lighted by the flashlight.       If you go the web site: http://time.gov you can see the dark and  light parts on the earth as you move from time zone to time zone. On that  web site, the earth is "flattened out" so that it can be shown on the screen,  but remember the earth is really a "ball".    Vince Calder  ======================================...  Since the sun is the source of daylight whenever we can see the sun it  is daytime.    Note also that we cannot always see the moon during the day.  Only when  it is on the side of the earth closest to the sun.  When the moon is on the side of the earth furthest from the sun we only  see it at night.  It takes about a 4 weeks for the moon from one side of  the earth to the other.  So we see it at night for two weeks and then  during the day for two weeks.    Greg Bradburn  ======================================...  You can see the sun during the day because daylight comes from the sun  and when there is daylight, it is daytime.  At night the sun is behind  the earth and so its light cannot be seen.    The moon is visible only when it is on your side of the earth, so it  is not always visible during the day or during the night.    But the sun and the moon are always there in space and always emitting  light.  If you went up in a spaceship and were far from the earth, you  could always see both the sun and the moon.  That would take a while  to get used to, since there would be no daytime or night time.|`|2Ypig4jBaa	If the sun is up then it must be daytime.  Confusion is the reason we do a lot of things.

We all know that speed X time = distance.  So if the distance L = one length of any wave, v = the speed of that wave, and t = the time to travel one wavelength (this is the so-called period T), we can write L = vt = vT.    Now is we simply set 1 wavelength = 1 cycle (where 360 deg or 2pi radians is a cycle), we note that L/T = 1/T = f has cycles/sec as its units.  And, of course, that's frequency f.      [NB:  The relationship f = 1/T is something you should remember because it applies to waves of all kinds.  That is frequency is the reciprocal of the wave period....always.]    Thus, we can rewrite L/T = Lf = v and, ta da, there you have the wave equation David gave you.  (I don't do lambdas, sorry).  But now you know where it came from and a bit of the physics behind it.

Hw5xFK0qaa	C(s) ? + ? HCl(aq) ?  ? no reaction    Neither graphite nor diamond is soluble in hydrochloric acid, and solid carbon does not react with simple inorganic acids.  Carbon tetrachloride certainly cannot be made by this reaction, as is suggested above.    Sn(s) ? + ? 2 HCl(aq) ?  ? SnCl2(aq) ? + ? H2(g)    Provided a sufficient excess of hydrochloric acid is present and the solution is not heated, a solution of tin(II) chloride will be formed.  Tin has two main oxidation states - +II and +IV - and acid alone is not a sufficiently strong oxidant to oxidise tin(II) to tin(IV).  If the solution is heated, particularly if there is not excess hydrochloric acid present, then insoluble Sn(OH)Cl(s) tends to precipitate from solution.    Pb(s) ? + ? 2 HCl(aq) ?  ? PbCl2(s) ? + ? H2(g)    Lead(II) chloride has only low solubility in water, and the presence of excess chloride ions in the solution (from excess hydrochloric acid) will ensure that almost all the lead(II) cations formed end up preciptating as PbCl2(s) rather than remaining in solution.  Lead has two main oxidation states - +II and +IV - and acid alone is not a sufficiently strong oxidant to oxidise lead(II) to lead(IV).|`|pSOQTumdaa	C + 4HCl --> CCl4 +2H2  Sn + HCl --> SnCl + H2 or SnCl2 + H2  you pick because you should know the oxidation numbers of tin.

But there must be both the money to accomplish those results and the individual and political wills to get started and keep going in the right direction.  As far as the money, we have seen in the last year how most of our investments can be wasted away, and incredible debt can be the result of throwing more money at stupid problems.  The people may want better life styles, but could they pay for them?  And with political systems of recurrent elections that will mean changes in direction of development frequently, progress will be very slow.  As an illustration, it has been 40 years since the first moon landing, and those attempts ended in 1972.  It is projected to get people back to the moon not until about 2020.

75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	this is against my better judgment.  i think you're not interested in why.    however, it occurred to me that, a given volume of air contains a given amount of energy.  as that air rises, the energy is distributed through a wider volume.  since heat is energy, then there is less energy in a given space.    alternatively, if you've pumped up a bicycle tire, you know the pump gets hot.  compressing the air adds energy.  if you've felt air coming out of that tire, it's cold.  expanding releases energy.    that's why it's colder up higher.    as to the comments that, "It's cold at the top of the stairs", yes it often is.  and there are several reasons.    --  there's a door at the bottom which is normally kept closed, to keep the heat down.    --  when you walk up the stairs, most often, the ceiling over your head is the ceiling of the floor above you high over your head.  hot air from downstairs is coming through the door, and going straight up.  colder air is coming down the stairs, underneath that hot air, right where you're walking.  that's what you're feeling.  but what happens to that hot air?  it's hovering near the ceiling, so the cold air in the space is generally not disturbed.  sometimes it's an attic, which has no insulation, and the roof is cooling the hot air off.    have a good day.    Edit:  >    Umm, you're complaining because i don't know what your house looks like?  it seems that my first comment was right on.    when i was a kid, i lived in 3 houses.  (not at the same time.)  1 had a door, the other 2 did not.  the one with a door had the most obvious difference in temp.  Even when you don't have a door, the physics i described is still correct.  the door just accentuates it.|`|avVdKiWKaa	As hot air rises, it cools off.  That's what makes clouds - it's the hot air cooling enough to reach the dewpoint.  "Hot" air is a misnomer.  It is the lapse rate -- the difference in temperature of one body of air compared to another -- that determines how fast air rises.  If it is 20 below zero at the top of Everest, you will still get "hot" air that happens to be only 10 degrees below zero ambient temperature.  And that air will indeed rise.  You will feel it as a breeze blowing against your frozen nasal snot icicles as you stand on Everest's summit.|`|SXoxEkfPaa	hot air begins to blow from the sea, rising up through the valleys, and eventually it reaches the mountains. it does begin to rise, but as it does it loses heat, which makes it plummet again. that's what causes those fierce winds that seem to glide above the mountains' surface.  moreover, as the air is less dense up there,  there is less pressure for the same given volume, and according to the ideal gas law, that should lower temperature.|`|uKTVCuOXaa	Maybe when the cold bit of space hits the rising steam from the heat it freezes and the resulting effect is an ice age pocket of air.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	I'll have to agree with BadBeast on this one.

Thinner air holds less heat (fewer molecules moving around and interacting with one another in the same volume of space).    That's the same reason mushroom clouds form.  The incredible heat that exists after large explosions sends the dust or condensation cloud towering upwards until it reaches a point where it can no longer maintain its heat due to the to the density of the air around it.  It then spreads out flat and then starts to fall back downwards (due to the fact that it is now cooler at the edges than at the top) and inwards (because the pillar of hot air creates a partial vacuum that sucks dust back into it).|`|mv5WdMv7aa	The sun's energy passes mostly through the atmosphere and heats the ground.

AA10927246	You'll have to tell us what additional work, projects and tests were taken in the last 3 weeks.  It's possible there were none in which case the grade would stay the same.    Or perhaps the average of the new grades was still 84% so it wouldn't change the overall average.    I'd ask the teacher for a breakdown.    Edit:  Okay, I did some more thinking after your reply.  You said there were no additional scores.  But the student had 100% participation for these 3 weeks.    So basically, if the student had close to 100% already, and they stayed at 100% there would be no change in the Participation grade.  Then when you weigh all the other scores, it stays at 84%.

It is gradual so not noticed til later.        You might notice that during times of happiness and activity your eyes lighten up again.   During times of stress and very tired, they darken.      Injuries and sickness can actually cause spots and lines in the colored part.      All the reasons for this you can find in the subject of Iridology.  That is how I started learning, cause I noticed it too.       My mother had dark brown eyes and black hair.   Me,  her first kid?   Pale, white hair and light blue eyes.  What the???    Around age 30 I noticed my eyes were turning brown on the outside rims and hazel inside.   I thought they were darkening like mom's.       Then I did a total body detox and  later noticed my eyes were blue again.  No more brown, at all.   Now more years later, they are light hazel again.  But the brown never came back.      I don't think it means brown eyes have toxins - just that I noticed change having already light eyes.  And, I had more than the normal amount of chemicals and junk growing up.  I was lucky enough to figure it out and get cleansed.      The moral of the story is - chemicals and junk is damaging to a body.

b7Ns0Lvyaa	no it is not true that electrolytes are polar covalent compounds since taking an example of molten NaCl which is an electovalent compound but a very good electrolyte and is not a polar compound .a matter of fact is that many electrolytes are electrovalent in nature used in aqueous  or molten state and rarely are covalent compounds (n specially polar compounds ) are used as electrolytes .|`|pSOQTumdaa	no  not all polar compounds are ionic in nature.  therefore, they don't produce ions to be electrolytes.  for example, there are molecular compounds that are polar but doesn't produce ions when solution.|`|InPqgS6daa	Yes, it is most likely so. An electrolyte is that substance that must be either in the molten or in the solution form in order to conduct electrons from one elctrode to another. Now this is obnious that such a solution/molten substance must be a polar compound as polar compounds are very good conductors of ions and/or electrons.
xXOnjDNOaa	Though much of chemistry comes down to valence, there are other factors that can come into play, for instance:    The Atomic radius of carbon is about 77 pm, where as lead's atomic radius is 175 pm (note: double the radius means 8 times the volume).      The first ionization energy of carbon is 1086 kj/mol while leads is 716.    Carbon's electronegativity is about 2.55 while Lead's is 2.33    While their valence is the same, carbon is pulling on its electrons much harder, and they are spread over a much smaller space, this makes carbon a good candidate to make chains of covalent bonds like it does.  The small size (in addition to the valency) also means that you won't be able to attach more than 4 groups to carbon (tetrahedral structure)    Lead on the other hand can't hold on to its electrons quite as well, and has a lot more area for things to attach.  This opens it up to forming a couple different ions (generally 2+ and 4+), as well as a much larger variety of complexes with multiple other groups (ligands) attached.     To a certain extent though, the chemistry is surprisingly similar between carbon and lead. A well known compound called tetraethyl lead was for a while used as a gasoline additive.   If you search you can find a number of other organo-lead compounds out there as well.|`|pSOQTumdaa	one is a metal and one is a non-metal.  regardless of placement in the periodic table and the number of valance electrons present, it boils down to the metal/non-metal trait.  carbon forms sp3 hybrids while Pb is a metal and would form ionic bonds instead of covalent bonds.    etc.
YHNK9UrQaa	Evolution is an ongoing process.  Nothing has been "perfected".  Nothing will be "perfected".    Evolution is the result of small changes in the genetic makeup of a species over a great deal of time, usually in response to changes in the environment.  Evolution will keep on happening as long as our environment keeps on changing.    There is fossil evidence to indicate what our humanoid ancestors looked like.  At the link below, you can see the bones of "Lucy", the oldest human being found, so far.  No one has found any fossil evidence of wild departures from the basic design - through the ages, people have had one head, two ears, two arms, two legs, a spine etc.  It is a design that is found in many other kinds of animals as well.    According to the theory of evolution all organisms on earth evolved from a common ancestor.  There is a great deal of evidence from many brances of science to support this theory.    In science, a "theory" is defined as far more than just the best educated guess.  In science, "gravity" is also a theory.      Of course, there are weird and harmful mutations where individuals are born with extra limbs, no brain, no eyes, and misplaced bits.  Most mutations are harmful.  Most harmful mutations are not passed on to the next generation.      Some harmless mutations persist.  (In the Amish population, having an eleventh or twelfth finger is relatively common).    Once in a while, a positive mutation will occur, and that mutation might be reproduced relatively rapidly (because an individual with a positive mutation might be able to live longer or find more mates).     However, unless there is a significant change in our environment, evolution among humans is not going to proceed as rapidly as it does among other animals, partly because humans know how to build homes and wear clothes to survive many changes, partly because humans embrace (and reproduce with) persons with disabilities, partly because humans travel (and reproduce) far and wide instead of isolating themselves in small communities, and partly because humans tend to be monogamous (so a person with a positive mutation wouldn't necessarily have the opportunity to have any more children than anyone else).|`|xXOnjDNOaa	To claim evolution has "gotten it right" is a bit of a misnomer about what evolution really is and makes it sound like evolution has stopped.  Evolution is the process of refining traits based on how well they lend themselves to survival and reproduction.  Humans (and all other creatures) are still evolving even today.  However, there are a number of human-like fossils that have been found, many of which have been proposed as ancestors to current humans, and some that are other species who branched away from those common ancestors that later went extinct (such as neanderthals).|`|xopIi2Vfaa	given that our ancestors did not have eyes in their toes and ears on their knees, those specific fossils have not be found and never will be found (unless a joker fabricates some really convincing fakes...).  But there are fossils known of human ancestors which did look different from us. Look up human evolution in a textbook or wikipedia. You can even look up mammalian evolution if you want to go futher back. And no, early mammals didn't have eyes on their toes either. That's one reason why we don't have them there...

In the case of the white rhino, preservation is a good thing since the main cause of rhino endangerment is man's fault. They are hunted for their horns. In many cases, animals go endangered for a reason. Either because they are being out-competed by an animal with a similar niche, their habitat is changing, or other natural reasons.  The problem is that humans feel it necessary to preserve EVERY endangered species when a lot of times it is not worth the time or money to save a species that is not fit to live in its environment. All of these reasons, other than human cause are the backbone to the evolutionary process. Organisms evolve to fit their surroundings, so if an animal is being out-competed, it either needs to evolve or go extinct|`|YsQQ30YJaa	There is a point to your question that the others are missing. If the animal is going out of existence because of us we should try to save it, but if it is on the way out for purely natural reasons then we should not interfere with nature.

To think that we almost wiped this animal out of existence because the poachers wanted their horns.|`|m16dhfrGaa	Your example of the rhino is endangered partly because of poaching.  Right there you should see a value for this animal.  There is another value which is cultural, spiritual and intrinsic value.  Furthermore, there may be a use for this animal that we have yet to discover.    There are too many things we don't know for us to allow the annihilation of a species.  Extinction means gone forever.  Even mosquitoes are good for bats to eat.  The plant that gives us chocolate is pollinated by one genus of small fly.  The dodo used to eat the seeds of a particular tree. In the digestive process the seed was prepared to germinate.  Since the extinction of the dodo, there have been no new trees of that species.  That took a long time to discover.  We just don't know what we're going to find out next.  But let's not throw away our raw materials before we know their potential use.|`|dFjKAmSOaa	The fact is every living organism has its place in the fundamentals of living (and dead) life, without these animals in their right place the world would not be as it is today, you may be right that maybe a rhino has no place in your view, but, the same could be said for us, why are we here? we know that the world would be thriving today without us humans, so really what is the point of us living?

And people are saying one extinct species can throw off an entire ecosystem? That's bullshit.  Choosing which species to save and which to kill is not our responsibility.  Nature has always found a way to balance itself out so let nature do its thing.    As for why people want to save endangered species? It has something to do with their bullshit religious morals and narrow mindedness and valuing animals more than most humans.  And even if it was our fault that a species is endangered, saving the species won't do much good for the environment. It would just make humans manipulate nature even more. People that want to save species want the species for their enjoyment, for their own guilt to be taken away, and for them to be seen as "good" humans. Now that is selfish and ignorant.
8Y7LQ6TGaa	You look in the documentation or online for a number in watts, or kW or VA or amps.     Watts or VA (equivalent to watts for this purpose) are a unit of power. kW, multiply by 1000 to get watts. Amps, multiply by the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) to get watts.    Once you have the watts of each appliance, you need to guess at or measure a utilization factor. A refrigerator is running perhaps 30-50% of the time. A microwave is used for only a few minutes per day. A light may be on 8 hours a day.    You will need to find out your electricity costs per kW-hr. You can get this from your bills or by contacting them. Typical is 20p per kW-hr.      Now take the power used by the appliance, and use the utilization factor to determine how many hours a month it is in use. there are 730.5 hours in a month. So if a refrigerator is operating 1/3 the time, that is 244 hours per month.    Take the hours/month and multiply by number of watts, and divide by 1000 (for kW) to get kW-hrs per month.    for the fridge using 300 watts, that is 300 x 244 / 1000 = 73 kw-hrs/mo    now multiply by your electricity rate.  73 kw-hrs/mo x 0.20/kw-hr = 14.60 per month    .|`|yxnUBSJqaa	If it has a plug in, 120VAC line cord, you can plug it into a line splitter and directly measure the current flowing through it.

Gojh26bhaa	Well color blindness is found men because it is a sex linked (also known as an x linked disease).  Since a male has a XY combination while females have XX.  So colorblindness is found on the X chromosome, so therefore it is a recessive cause a femal could have colorblindness on one X chromosome and a normal red green color receptor on the other X chromosome.  The female will NOT be colorblind since it is a recessive disease and she hast to have two infected chromosomes.  Males have only one X chromosome, so therefore if they have a red green color blindness gene then they automatically are color blind.|`|xXOnjDNOaa	A recessive gene is expressed only if there isn't a dominant gene to be expressed instead.  For conditions like red-green colorblindness and hemophilia, the gene is recessive and found on the X chromosome.  For a female (who has two X chromosomes) having just one X with the gene isn't enough to have it expressed, it requires having both X chromosomes to have it (otherwise the dominant gene will be expressed). For a male (who only has 1 X chromosome and 1Y chromosome) simply getting one copy of the gene from his mother will cause him to have the condition (because there is no second X chromosome to contain a dominant gene).  This makes these conditions far more likely to occur in men than in women (I believe it's something on the order of you'll find 15 colorblind men for every colorblind woman you find).|`|xopIi2Vfaa	It is in females, and it isn't really in males. That's probably what confuses you.   The gene for the red pigment is on an x-chromosomes. Females have two of them, and the gene product from one chromosome is enough so they have normal vision. So if just one gene is defective, it won't show. Which is called recessive.   Now males have just X-chromosome and consequently just one gene for that pigment. So if that's messed up they are colorblind.    Though there are also different kinds of colorblindness and not all are on the X-chromosome, but the one which is X-linked is the most common one.|`|b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	The Y chromosome is just like an X except its missing some pieces, right?    So if someone has a gene on the X chromosome that does something bad (or just odd, like color blindness), but it's on the part that is MISSING on the Y chromosome....then they'd have the bad trait.    But if someone has two X chromosomes, and one of them has the bad trait, and the other has a normal version, then they'll show only the normal version as the end result.  And so THAT is why red-green color blindness is a sex-linked recessive trait.  You only show the trait if you have a certain problem on the X chromosome and either the same problem on the other X (if you're a girl), or if you have the Y chromosome (which can't correct for the problem).|`|F2ICQKmBaa	I suggest you read about the dominant genes and the recessive genes .
iZdh54S8aa	it depends on what type of graph are you drawing.  if its a bar graph, the you could do that  if you are drawing a scatter graph, or an orthonormal system, then you can't.  however, instead of listing all the numbers, you can start from 0, and then make the axis a dotted line from 0 to 90 so that it is evident that you are not drawing to scale, and then in a straight not dotted line after 90.   hope that my answer was helpful|`|Y25qW2SOaa	is this question more english than maths???|`|T6QhYVWJaa	If i think I understand your question correctly. Then what your saying is you want to have a graph that starts at 90 and increments by units of 10. It is ok to do this, but because you are not starting with the units you are incrementing by (10) you need to have a jagged line between 0 and 90. i.e. "/\/\/------" I hope this makes sense.
InPqgS6daa	Yes, it happens but then it becomes a question for the doctors and medicine, what has this got to do with physics. Actually what physics says is that everything around us is in motion but we call something to be at rest only by comparing that particualr object with something else that's in motion. For instance, the earth is in constant motion but when you are standing still then compared to the movement of earth, you are at rest and the eath is in motion.|`|AA11148143	The illusion can also arise when the object is seen without a reference frame, as can happen with stars or planets. If the eye muscles contract and the eye moves, we see that as motion by the object. This comes up in UFO investigations.    It is hard to hold your eye perfectly still for any period of time.

on5yFSsLaa	To find the sum of a finite arithmetic series, you need to know the first term, the last term, and the number of terms.  The formula is:  Sum = n(x+y)/2  where n is the number of terms, x is the first term and y is the last term.  So apply this formula to your questions:    6.  24 is the first term.  15 is the last term.  there are 10 terms.  So, using the formula, 10(24+15)/2 = 39*5 = 195    7.  3 is the first term.  12 is the last term.  there are 10 terms.  So, using the formula, 10(3+12)/2 = 15*5 = 75    8. 25 is the first term.  54 is the last term.  there are 30 terms.  So, using the formula, 30(25+54)/2 = 15*79 = 1185    9.  This one you need to visulize a little more.  It might help if you draw the triangle out.  There are 17 "rows" of triangles - each contributing 12 cm to the side - for a total of 204 cm per side.      Assume that White is on the "top" in row 1.  Then your triangle will have:  Row 1:  W  Row 2:  WBW  Row 3: WBWBW  Row 4:  WBWBWBW  etc.    In every row, the number of White triangles increases by 1.  So, 1 is our first term.  17 is our last term, and there are 17 terms.  So, using our formula, there are 17(17+1)/2 white tiles = 17*9 = 153 white tiles.    The blue tiles are similar, but they start in row 2.  As a result, 1 is our first term, 16 is our last term, and there are 16 terms.  So, using our formula, there are 16(16+1)/2 blue tiles = 8*17 = 136 blue tiles.      There you go - Good luck!|`|S08uUTbbaa	6. sum(n=1 to 10) 24-(n-1) = sum(n=1 to 10) 25-n    7. sum(n=1 to 10) 3+(n-1) = sum(n=1 to 10) 2+n    8. sum(n=1 to 30) 25+(n-1) = sum(n=1 to 30) 24+n    9. conversions first: 20.4 dm = 204 cm.  using 12 cm tiles that is 204cm/12cm = 17 tiles per side = 17 rows including the top row. each row has an odd number of tiles. The question is not clear regarding which tile begins the sequence and whether the same color tile begins each row (which will alternate internally) or if alternating tiles begin each row (which creates a diamond pattern internally).  So we will solve each way:    If the same color tile begins each row:  number of top row-colored or external tiles = sum(n=1 to 17) n  number of second row internal colored tiles = sum(n=1 to 17) n-1    [this is the same as the   Row 1: W  Row 2: WBW  Row 3: WBWBW  Row 4: WBWBWBW  example provided by Sharky]    If the beginning color tile alternates with each row:  same color as color 1 (top row) = [sum(k=1 to 8) 2n+2(k-1)]+9 >>>>> here you are counting the rows two at a time, so sum k 1 thru 8 catches the first 16 rows, plus 9 for the number of color 1 in the last row.

9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	I don't think anyone hates monkeys...but from all your other questions you are asking about keeping monkeys as pets, which is a totally different story.  Monkeys do not make good pets...end of story.  I think being so young you do not truly understand the complexities of what owning such an animal entails.  They are basically like having an infant child that never grows up.  You say you are 10 years old..are you old enough to take on the responsibility of having a human baby at your age??  Many adults have problems raising babies..what makes you..a 10 year old think you can handle something like that.  Are you also aware that monkeys can live for up to 25-30 years.  Can you provide a home for this monkey until you are 35 or 40 years old?  How can you possibly know where or what you will be doing at that age.  You will most likely be married and have children of your own..will you drag your monkey along thoughout your entire life..junior high, high school, college, marriage, pregnancy, etc. etc. all the time providing it care.  I bet you also don't know that most monkeys people obtain for pets end up being euthanized as people do not research enough and get these animals for all the wrong reasons.  I am a wildlife biologist (for 10 years now) and have a background in veterinary medicine (12 years) and used to be a zookeeper (2 years) and I have a degree in zoology, and have had pets all my life and used to run a pet sitting business where I cared for all sorts of animals..and even I would never in a million years attempt to own a monkey as a pet as even I would not be qualified.

Alternatively, for a more recent extinction you could mention the Yangtze river dolphin.    For your second species I would choose an animal which is locally extinct in your country, for example the grey wolf in the UK.    Many recent extinctions (and those ongoing) are due to human pressures, so I would try to mention the reasons behind human-induced extinction. A good comparison to this would be to find a species which has become extinct (perhaps only locally) due to other factors, for example a change in climate or food resources.

d0b4766c80603988f62747e14effa4e7aa	A parabola which opens up has a lowest point and a parabola which opens down has a highest point.  The highest or lowest point on a parabola is called the vertex.  The parabola is symmetric about a vertical line through its vertex, called the axis of symmetry. The figure below shows a parabola opening up with vertex (0.75, 0.875) and axis of symmetry x = 0.75.        Vertex Form of a Quadratic Function              To find the vertex of a parabola, we will write the function in the form     .  As an example, consider the function . We first complete the square on the right side:                f(x) = 2(x2 - 4x) + 7                  (factor out 2 from the terms 2x2 - 8x)                      = 2(x2 - 4x + 4) + 7 - 8       (complete the square of x2 - 4x)                     = 2(x - 2)2 - 1                                 (factor the perfect square and simplify.)    Notice that for all values of x.  Thus f(x) = 2(x - 2)2 - 1 3 -1 for all values of x and the minimum value of the function is -1 when x = 2.  The point (2, -1) is the lowest point on the graph so it is the vertex of the parabola. The vertical line x = 2 is the axis of symmetry.  See the graph below.                                         In general,  is called vertex form of a quadratic function.  When a quadratic function is written in vertex form, we can easily determine the vertex (h, k). If the coefficient a > 0, then the parabola opens upward and the vertex is the lowest point on the parabola. We say that k is the minimum value of the quadratic function. On the other hand, if the coefficient a          Example  Write the quadratic function in vertex form. Determine the vertex and the maximum or minimum value of the function.    Solution  We will complete the square to write the function in vertex form:        The vertex form is , so the vertex is (3, -11). Since a                         Once we know the vertex of a parabola, we can determine the range of the quadratic function. Consider the function, . Previously we determined that the parabola has a minimum value of -1, occurring when x = 2. Thus the range of the quadratic function is {y? y 3 -1}. As another example, lets return to the function in the above example. The graph of this function is a parabola opening downward and the maximum value of the function is 11. Therefore, the range of the quadratic function is     Finding the Vertex Algebraically  The vertex of a quadratic function  can also be determined algebraically. We first assume that the quadratic function has two x-intercepts. Then the graph is a parabola that crosses the x-axis in two distinct points. Since the parabola is symmetric with respect to a vertical line through its vertex (the axis of symmetry) the x-coordinate of the vertex is always halfway between the two x-intercepts. By the quadratic formula, the two x-intercepts are         Notice that the same number, , is being added to and subtracted from . It follows that the number  is halfway between  This means that the x-coordinate of the vertex is . We can then find the y-coordinate of the vertex by evaluating  Although we assumed that the quadratic function had two x-interecpts when we derived our vertex formula, it also holds in the other two cases, where the parabola has one or no x-intercepts.    Example  Find the vertex of the quadratic function . Use the vertex to determine the maximum or minimum value of the function and find its range.    Solution  The vertex formula gives  To find the second coordinate of the vertex, we evaluate The vertex of the parabola is (3, 53). Since a             Recall the function, which describes the height in feet of a ball t seconds after it is thrown upward from the top of a 200 foot high building. We can now determine when the ball hits the ground and the maximum height that it reaches, as well as the time that it reaches that maximum height. When the ball hits the ground, its height above ground will be zero. This gives the quadratic equation . Using the quadratic formula, we find that the solutions are     and      (rounded to two decimal places). Since the time cannot be negative, we see that the ball strikes the ground after 5.21 seconds. The maximum height of the ball will be given by the second coordinate of the vertex and the time will be the first coordinate. Using the vertex formula we find that  (rounded  to tow decimal places). Next we evaluate   This means that the ball reaches its max|`|a402b2b934220e25a01eaaaa8e616ea9aa	let y = 2x^2 + 4x - 5    y = 2(x^2 + 2x) - 5    y = 2(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) - 5    y = 2(x + 1)^2 - 7    y + 7 = 2(x+1)^2|`|LVPNuEsLaa	vertex form is y = a(x - x0)^2 + y0    for yours:    y = 2(x + 1)^2 - 7

Carbon is the major chemical constituent of most organic matter, from fossil fuels to the complex molecules (DNA and RNA) that control genetic reproduction in organisms. Yet by weight, carbon is not one of the most abundant elements within the Earth's crust. In fact, the lithosphere is only 0.032% carbon by weight. In comparison, oxygen and silicon respectively make up 45.2% and 29.4% of the Earth's surface rocks.

Quoting from Wikipedia:  In late 1943, Berg was assigned to Project Larson, an OSS operation set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects John Shaheen. The stated purpose of the project was to kidnap Italian rocket and missile specialists out of Italy and bring them to the U.S. However, there was another project hidden within Larson called Project AZUSA with the goal of interviewing Italian physicists to see what they knew about Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizs?cker. It was similar in scope and mission to the Alsos project.[38]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_Berg    The Dodgers, in Brooklyn and later in Los Angeles, employed baseball's first full-time statistician, Allan Roth.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpe...|`|mKmrfeX7aa	Newton invented gravity.|`|OTuVOvEXaa	Hippocrates|`|bD9tNbSaaa	Sir Roger Banister

DU2THcAdaa	If you want to do some background research, Wikipedia is probably a good place to start. Articles on this site should give you a basic grounding on the subject of ecosystem destruction and fragmentation. You should always aim to check the citations used on Wikipedia, the reference list at the bottom of an article often provides links to 'official' websites/documents which are usually a more accurate source of information. For example, the WWF website contains reports  on the loss of biodiversity in rainforest regions. Similarly, the IUCN Red List offers detailed accounts of many endangered rainforest species.    Ask a teacher if your school has access to any academic journals, many of these focus solely on conservation matters. Alternatively, Google Scholar allows you to search for many peer-reviewed articles that are in the public domain. Play around with your search terms to see what provides the best results, e.g. "rainforest +logging -Amazon".    Another online source of information is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]. Their reports contain sections which specifically relate to tropical regions, covering many aspects of climate change and the potential impacts on natural habitats. Look out for their summaries for 'policy makers', which offer a condensed version of the key points.    Finally, you can't go wrong with spending a while browsing your school/local library for books which discuss the aforementioned points.    Good luck.

A distinctive fossil can also be sued, provided it has an absolute date.    Relative dating is determining which of two or more rocks is older than the other. For example, if you have an andesite dike and a sandstone unit, the sandstone is older than the dike.      Their only similarity is that they are used to develop the geologic time scale. Not all rocks can be subjected to relative and absolute dating methods, so we have to use a combination of the two.|`|cRnvO1F3aa	They both help you to identify the time period in which the rock formed and thus you can determine information about its surroundings and other information

Reptiles are oftentimes green because they need the sun to regulate their body temperature (cold-blooded) and the green color helps them to absorb the maximum amount of light/heat when they are sunbathing. The reason they are actually green is because the green wavelengths of light are NOT used. Everything else is absorbed and the green is reflected    plants are green because the chloroplasts in the leaves need to absorb all the light and possible, and the carotins are reddish and absorb whatever is left over.

The most common non-spherical type are parabolic reflectors, found in optical devices such as reflecting telescopes that need to image distant objects, since spherical mirror systems suffer from spherical aberration.  go through the link i am providing.you will clear your concepts better.

It was the first time I'd ever lived away from home without one of my parents. Yes, I was scared, almost terrified I've been a type 1 diabetic since I was 26 months old. My Dad and I did not know any one in Tucson, but his cousin lived in the retirement community in NW Phoenix (? Sun Valley? - Glendale, AZ. I didn't know how to drive or have a car then.    After I got my second bachelor's degree, I wasn't enrolled anywhere. I decided since I had always wanted to live in OK most of the time, and my mom went to graduate school at the University of Oklahoma, and I found out that the School of Geology and Geophysics at OU is one of the best geology schools in the country, I applied to OU and was accepted for the spring semester. I'd always wanted to see if what my Mom had told me about living in OK was true. It is true, everything my momma told me. :-) The only thing I have NOT experienced that she had is pitch black dust storms like the OK panhandle went through in the 1930's. I have experienced dust storms in Norman, but they were not anywhere as severe as the Dust Bowl dust storms. Yes, I was in Norman during the May 3, 1999 tornado swarm. A friend of my mother's was living in Norman in 1981. She gave my Dad and I a tour of a much smaller Norman that it is now, so we did know some one.     I would love to go back to school, but I'd have to move to Boulder, by myself. I don't know if I have the energy or stamina to do that, and I no longer have the financial means to pay for the move or school like I did when my father was alive

AA10165376	There are a number of theories that can possibly explain this phenomenon, although it may be a combination of effects each playing a role.    Firstly, we have evaporation. Some of the hot water could be lost through evaporation meaning that there is less to freeze and it can therefore freeze faster than the cooler water. This however doesn't explain what happens in closed containers so can only be part of the solution. There is also the fact that warmer water is less dense and there are therefore less molecules of warm water as in an equal volume of cooler water. Less molecules = less total heat loss required to freeze the water. But again, this effect on its own doesn't seem great enough to fully explain the Mpemba effect.    Next we have the possibility that the heated water is somehow changed in its properties. Hot water can hold less dissolved gas than cold (think how much gas bubbles out of water just before it boils) and the presence of this gas could be lowering the effective freezing temperature of the cold water. Or the loss of the gas in the warmer water could allow convection currents to be set up more easily.    The presence of convection currents in water is a nice explanation for the Mpemba effect. The idea is that, in hot water, currents are set up with the hot traveling up the middle and cold down the sides so the top is warmer than the bottom. This means that even when the hot water cools to the same average temperature as the cold, the temperature distribution of the water may not be equal. In other words, 30oC starting temperature water will uniformly be at this temperature while cooled water that started much hotter can have an average 30oC temperature but could include some water that is hotter and some that is colder. The convection currents set up in the warmer water could in theory stay in place until the water freezes, meaning it loses heat much faster than the water that started at a cooler temperature. Supercooling could also be involved. Supercooling can cause a liquid to remain a liquid past its normal freezing temperature. If the cooler water supercools while the warmer doesn't, it could take longer to become a solid explaining the Mpemba effect.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	It DOESN'T... that is just an old wives tale that stupid people still believe...

A figure has line symmetry if there is a line on which the figure may be folded so that the two parts of the figure will coincide.    Point symmetry exists when a figure is built around a single point called the center of the figure.  For every point in the figure, there is another point found directly opposite it on the other side of the center.

MnrgzE9aaa	Premirement, tout bon scientifique doit sortir de l'anthropomorphisme habituel. S'il y a des extra-terrestres intelligents, il existe une probabilit norme qu'ils n'aient pas du tout la mme fa?on de penser que nous. L'homme a besoin de coloniser, de conqurir, c'est un reste de ses pulsions animales. Est-ce certain que des extra-terrestres auraient besoin de venir s'installer dans le systme solaire (sommes-nous si anthropocentrs que ?a?) . De plus, bien s?r qu'on a du mal  voir des traces ! on ne dtecte les plantes extra-solaires qu'indirectement, alors pour y voir des choses plus petites cela risque d'tre dur...    Autre argument : certains disent "ils ont peut-tre pas la techno pour voyager loin mais au moins celle de communiquer en ondes radio, or on entend rien". SETI a beau tre joli, on n'coute pas sur toutes les frquences ni vers tous les endroits de la galaxie. De plus, qui dit qu'ils n'ont pas abandonn les ondes radio il y a des millions d'annes, prfrant utiliser les communications via des technologies dont nous ne soup?onnons mme pas l'existence (imaginez par exemple que l'on sache utiliser facilement des trous de vers, la premire application serait de faire passer des informations -plus besoin d'ondes radio). Qui dit qu'ils ne savent pas manipuler d'autres dimensions pour communiquer ou se dplacer ?  Toutes ces fa?ons de  voir leur technologie proche de la notre ne me para?t pas trs humble.    Pourquoi n'auraient-ils pas communiqu avec nous ?  -> Imaginez que ce soit une civilisation extrmement plus avance. Elle l'est suffisamment pour savoir se cacher de nous (comme nous savons espionner la faune sans qu'elle nous voit). Une fois encore, cela serait prtentieux de penser qu'ils auraient besoin ou envie de communiquer avec nous. Imaginez que nous trouvions en papouasie, une tribu d'hommes de nanderthal. Que dirait la communaut scientifique d'aprs vous ?  "Surtout, ne les approchons pas, observons les sans qu'ils ne nous voient". C'est un principe de physique classique : plus on observe, plus on mesure, plus on perturbe.    Quand on voit l'chelle de Kardashev et les sphres de Dyson prvues, on se place dans une vision technologique anthropocentre une fois encore. Une fois encore, on imagine ce que pourraient faire des civilisations extra-terrestres puissantes conomiquement et technologiquement tout en gardant une vision de l'univers qui est celle de l'homme du 20me sicle.   Si Jules Verne avait mis une telle ide, il aurait sans doute dit que les extra-terrestres auraient besoin de canon gigantesques pour dplacer leurs vaisseaux. Comment se fait-il qu'on en ait jamais vu ? Ou trouver des impacts d'obus ? J'exagre, mais l'ide est l. En ce sens, quelque part, les extra-terrestres font partie de notre phantasme, celui de pouvoir quitter cette plante comme on veut et voyager trs loin et comme tous les phantasmes, ils ont les moyens de nos connaissances seules. On n'imagine pas ce que l'on ne peut imaginer.     Bref, le paradoxe de Fermi, n'en est pas un car il est biais par notre fa?on humaine de dfinir et observer ce que l'on cherche. En ?a, nous manquons d'humilit.     Un exemple : avec SETI une frquence trs coute est celle de l'oscillation de l'hydrogne car le pari a t fait que si une civilisation autre cherche  communiquer avec d'autres par onde radio, elle choisira une frquence "remarquable".   "Pourquoi pas celle de la molcule la plus abondante de l'univers? Ou alors pourquoi pas celle de l'eau ?" nous disons -nous  SETI. Mais en fait, il est possible que pour cette civilisation il y ait des frquences plus videntes ? Une frquence de lyman-alpha ou une frquence "signature" qui ne les identifie que eux... On ne peut pas tre dans leur "tte" ou leur mandibules. On pense que s'ils existent ils n'ont pas encore compris comment utiliser la radio mais peut-tre sont-ils bien au-del et attendent que NOUS comprenions comment utiliser leurs moyens de communication.     Ah aussi, pour terminer, vous vous rappelez la plante des singes ? Comment les singes utilisrent les armes technologiques des humains pour le malheur de tous ? N'y aurait-il pas un grand risque pour une civilisation avance  mettre des technologies dangereuses dans les mains d'une espce comme l'homme ?    Peut-tre que dans le pass, le contact a t fait, que les humains ont tout fait foirer et que les extra-terrestres ont effac toutes traces de leur passage et des moyens de les voir.|`|tt85Ebx5aa	Il  y a une phrase que j'aime beaucoup qui dit  l'absence de preuve n'est pas la preuve de l'absence !!  je ne sais plus de qui c'est     memes si les nombreux temoignages sur les ovnis ne sont pour la plus part que des canulars , beaucoup reste inexpliqus !

jRJBs4hxaa	If you are finding f'(cot (x)), here is a better way.  cot (x) = cos(x) / sin(x)  Use the Quotient Rule to differentiate.  f'(x) = [sin(x) (-sin(x)) - cos(x) cos(x)] / sin^2(x) =   f'(x) = -[ sin^2(x)+cos^2(x)] / sin^2(x) =-1/sin^2(x)  f'(x) = -csc^2(x)|`|j7hLlnGIaa	Your notation is perhaps a bit misleading.    Do you mean you want to find d/dx(f(x)) for f(x) = cot(x) or do you mean you want to find d/dx(f(y(x))) for y(x) = cot(x)?    I assume the latter, because you want the answer -csc(x)^2, but here's why that notational issue comes in.    If f(x) = cot(x), then  you have f'(x) = -sec(x)^2/(tan(x)^2)  = -(1/cos(x))^2 / (sin(x)/cos(x))^2)  = -(1/cos(x))^2 * (cos(x)/sin(x))^2)  = - (1/sin(x))^2 = -csc(x)^2 as desired    If it is the other possibility, namely d/dx (f(cot(x)))  = f'(cot(x))*d/dx(cot(x)) = f'(cot(x))*(-csc(x)^2)  This is the chain rule, and if you are unfamiliar with it, the rule is that if you have a function f(x), and another function g(x), and you consider the derivative of f(g(x)), then (where it exists), it will be precisely (f(g(x))' = f'(g(x))*g'(x).  This is often proven by considering difference quotient arguments, which one has to be careful about...

644fe1716005347c136fdc7280063496aa	Actually, I think interestingly enough as you go up Everest you might actually gain weight. According to the answer to my question yesterday (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;... buoyancy of air makes you about .2 pounds lighter at sea level than you would be in a vacuum. If you go up Mount Everest the gravitational attraction will go down some small amount (K/4000^2 - K/4005^2), but your weight will increase due to the lesser buoyancy of the air at the higher altitude. Which affect would be stronger is not obvious to me.|`|a3e3cd33f2782d9cbcd0ff84e37936ffaa	:))  a brief tip on gravity and you decide yourself of the excact answer:    force of Gravity is inversely proportional to the sqaure of the  distance between two bodies (i.e. earth and yourself in this case!)  to actually measure the effect, a universal Gravitational Constant G was introduced/ derived as "6.67  10?11 N m2 kg?2." Please excuse for gettiung too much technical.    So in effect, as soon the body starts moving 'away' from the centre of the earth, it 'appears' to loose weight due to the reduction in the pull. Although the effect is very minimal to be experienced at lower hieghts.    That means, a body will invariably 'weigh' "relatively" lesser at Mt. Everest than at Sea-level. You move still farther from the earth's core,  and the weight reduces further. However your mass remains same irrespective of distance, position. Because Weight = Mass x gravity. Weight changes as gravity does!! never the mass!!! people get confused because the term Weight is used differently in physics. Weight is not just weight but a force in physics.     So, loosing weight means escaping from the gravitational pull of the earth. In other words, the body "tends" to be less affected by the earth's forces as it moves away from the earth. So as the body moves away, the weight "tends" towards zero.    however, remember that the energy required to move the body outside farther from the earth is also ENORMOUS!! :))

a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	It's all about conservation of energy.  When the spring is compressed 5 cm it has a potential energy of kx2/2 where k is the constant and x is the compression (and they're in the MKS system, not the CGS system ?) so  Ep = 120*(.05)2/2 = .15J  That's *all* the energy there is in the system.  To push a 100g ball a height of   .05*sin(10) = 0.008682 m requires  mgh = .1*9.8*.008 = .00784J of that energy.  The remainder is available to be converted into speed (kinetic energy) so .15-.008682 = 0.141318J and since Ek = mv2/2  v = (2*.141318/.1) = 1.681178 rounded to 1.68 m/s.      Doug|`|c067a5c80aa86d6ee35cf6a5eec44ceaaa	Hi,    This problem is easy if you only think interms of energy:        Stored Potential Energy Of The Spring(SE)=                   Final Potential Energy Of The Ball when launched(PE)               + Final Kinetic Energy Of Ball(KE)                                                 .........{Conservation Of Energy}      So ,the stored Potential Energy of the spring is               = 1/2*k*x^2               =0.15J    .....{k=1.2N/cm , x = 5cm;remember to convert                                     cm to m}     And, the final Potential energy of the ball is when it leaves the plunger,which means you need the vertical component of the 5cm length = 0.05sin10 m      So the PE = m*g*h                       = 0.0085 J (taking g=9.83)       And the final K.E. = 1/2*m*vel^2                                 = 0.05*v^2       Now all you have to do is replpace the values:          0.15 = 0.0085 + 0.05*v^2          v^2 = 2.83    On solving, v = 1.68 m/s    Best Of Luck

The famous English mathematician G. H. Hardy visited Ramanujan on his death-bed.  Having nothing much to talk about, Hardy mentioned that the taxi number was a very boring number, namely 1729.  Ramanujan quickly put Hardy in his place by stating that is was a VERY INTERESTING number, because it was the smallest positive integer expressible as a sum of the cubes of two integers in two different ways.|`|T2pHNQhEaa	1729 (number)        This article is about the number 1729. For the year AD 1729, see 1729.      List of numbers  Integers    >  1729  Cardinal One thousand seven hundred  [and] twenty-nine  Ordinal 1729th  Factorization 7 \cdot 13 \cdot 19  Divisors 7, 13, 19, 91, 133, 247  Roman numeral MDCCXXIX  Binary 11011000001  Octal 3301  Duodecimal 1001  Hexadecimal 6C1    1729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number, after a famous anecdote of the British mathematician G. H. Hardy regarding a hospital visit to the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. In Hardy's words [1]:           1729 (number)  I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."        1729 (number)    The quotation is sometimes expressed using the term "positive cubes", as the admission of negative perfect cubes (the cube of a negative integer) gives the smallest solution as 91 (which is a factor of 1729):        91 = 63 + (?5)3 = 43 + 33    Of course, equating "smallest" with "most negative", as opposed to "closest to zero" gives rise to solutions like ?91, ?189, ?1729, and further negative numbers. This ambiguity is eliminated by the term "positive cubes".    Numbers such as        1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103    that are the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in n distinct ways have been dubbed taxicab numbers. 1729 is the second taxicab number (the first is 2 = 13 + 13). The number was also found in one of Ramanujan's notebooks dated years before the incident.    1729 is the third Carmichael number, and a Zeisel number. It is a centered cube number, as well as a dodecagonal number, a 24-gonal and 84-gonal number.    Investigating pairs of distinct integer-valued quadratic forms that represent every integer the same number of times, Schiemann found that such quadratic forms must be in four or more variables, and the least possible discriminant of a four-variable pair is 1729 (Guy 2004).    Because in base 10 the number 1729 is divisible by the sum of its digits, it is a Harshad number. It also has this property in octal (1729 = 33018, 3 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 7) and hexadecimal (1729 = 6C116, 6 + C + 1 = 1910), but not in binary.    1729 has another interesting property: the 1729th decimal place is the beginning of the first occurrence of all ten digits without repetition in the decimal representation of the transcendental number e, although, of course, this fact would not have been known to either mathematician, since the computer algorithms used to discover this were not implemented until much later. [2]    Masahiko Fujiwara showed that 1729 is one of four natural numbers (the others are 81 and 1458 and the trivial case 1) which, when its digits are added together, produces a sum which, when multiplied by its reversed self, yields the original number:        1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19      19  91 = 1729    It has occasionally been suggested that Hardy's story is apocryphal, on the grounds that he almost certainly would have been familiar with some of these features of the number.[citation needed]    References to 1729    The television show Futurama contains several jokes about the Hardy-Ramanujan number. In one episode, the robot Bender receives a Christmas card from the machine that built him labeled "Son  1729". Ken Keeler, a writer on the show with a Ph. D. in Applied Math, said that "that 'joke' alone is worth six years of grad school." In another episode, Bender's serial number is revealed to be the sum of two cubes: his number is 2716057 = 9523 + (?951)3, while that of fellow robot Flexo is 3370318 = 1193 + 1193. (This datum is one of the pieces of evidence the episode uses to establish that Bender and Flexo are a pair of good-and-evil twins.) The starship Nimbus displays the hull registry number BP-1729, which simultaneously riffs on the USS Enterprise's NCC-1701. Finally, the episode The Farnsworth Parabox contains a montage sequence where the heroes visit several parallel universes in rapid succession, one of which is labeled "Universe 1729".    The physicist Richard Feynman demonstrated his abilities at mental calculation when, during a trip to Brazil, he was challenged to a calculating contest against an experienced abacist. The abacist happened to challenge Feynman to compute the cube root of 1729.03; since Feynman knew that 1729 was equal to 123+1, he was able to give an accurate value for its cube root mentally using interpolation techniques (specifically, binomial expansion). The abacist had to solve the problem by a more laborious algorithmic method, and lost the competition to Feynman.    Some reports say that the octal equivalent (3301) was the password to Xerox PARC's main computer.    The play Proof (and its adapted film) by David Auburn also contains a reference to 1729.    The movie Lucky Number Slevin also references the number 1729 in association with the character Nick Fisher.

(activation energy= energy of colliding atoms/molecules must be above a certain limit before they can react to form product).    catalysts:  -- increase speed of reaction,  --allow reactions to occur at lower temperature,  --are reusable so more environmentally friendly,  --for some reactions, form certain intermediate products that maybe commercially important in other productions.|`|9880375243a81621987b720e714aaed9aa	In chemistry and biology, catalysis is the acceleration (increase in rate) of a chemical reaction by means of a substance, called a catalyst, that is itself not consumed by the overall reaction. The word is derived from the Greek noun ??, related to the verb ?, meaning to annul or to untie or to pick up.    A catalyst decreases the activation energy of a chemical reaction.

So that COULD be considered a product of animal cloning that people can buy. But if you where hoping for a weird thing floating in a jar. Look up tissue and organ culture that will be promising (but expensive).

fa83811f1c8efc3d346550599d36f12caa	Es por un efecto termodinmico, ya que en la tropsfera el aire que asciende se enfra y el aire que baja se calienta, por lo tanto a mayor altura menor tempratura, coincidiendo tambin que a mayor altura hay menor presin.  Esto es as hasta los 10.000 metros cuando comienza la estatsfera y la situacin se invierte, osea que a mayor altura mayor temperatura.

Bye saludos, muy buena pregunta y por eso te regalo tu estrellita.|`|7DpL4nd0aa	Cierto es que el sol est muy lejos y que la diferencia de distancia es despreciable. Sin embargo, las capas superiores de la atmsfera no es que estn ms cerca del sol, sino que estn antes y absorben la energa primero.    Lo que ocurre es que la variacin de temperatura en la atmsfera no es como t dices. Eso ocurre en la troposfera. Pero un poco ms arriba, a unos 25.000m de altura est la capa de ozono, que es una zona caliente porque absorbe mucha cantidad de energa en forma de radiacin ultravioleta.    En la troposfera (que es la parte de la atmsfera ms cercana al suelo) se invierte la tendencia natural de que est ms caliente lo ms cercano al sol. Es decir, a mayor altura, ms fro. Eso es porque la luz que atraviesa la atmsfera llega al suelo. El suelo absorbe la energa, y la reemite en forma de radiacin infrarroja. Esta radiacin es ms energtica (caliente) ms cerca del suelo.    Hace no mucho tiempo respond a una pregunta similar y di enlaces donde se vea muy bien los cambios de temperatura con la altura.

En qu consiste? En que sol calienta suelo, suelo irradia este calor de regreso al cosmos, pero por la presencia de atmosfera, el calor irradiado regresa a la tierra. Que ms gruesa capa de atmosfera - ms marcado efecto invernadero, mayor temperatura. Es por eso que en las alturas de monta?a, donde la capa de atmosfera es ms delgada, efecto invernadero es menor y el aire se enfra ms.        Cron tiene razon. Y Pablo tambien. La causa de efecto - atmosfera. recordemos de efecto invernadero|`|YXx5SGWaaa	No entiendo bien el final de la pregunta, pero a mayor altura, menor temperatura. La temperatura desciende 1ocada 180m que ascendemos en promedio, por eso, cuando te encuentras en la cima de las monta?as hace ms fro, y no es que te acerques ms al sol, la distancia Tierra-Sol sigue siendo siempre la misma, la cuestin es que el enfriamiento se debe a que te alejas ms del calor que produce la superficie terrestre.Espero te sirva.

A few people are able to escape in spaceships to land on a moon of the gas giant planet, which is coincidentally much like Earth and which, by the way, will be shifted by gravitational perturbations into an orbit around the sun that was a lot like Earth's orbit had been.    I'll just bet that this book is one of the sources of the Nibiru hoax, along with the fantasies of Zecharia Sitchin (whose name, I might add, deeply suggests that he might be a hoaxer himself). Edit: Ah ha. I just now read his Wikipedia article:    "Zecharia Sitchin (born 1922) is an author of books promoting an ancient astronaut theory of human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the "Annunaki" (or "Nephilim"), a race of aliens from a planet he calls Nibiru in the Earth's solar system. He asserts that Sumerian mythology reflects this view, though his speculations are entirely discounted by mainstream scientists, historians, and archaeologists, who see many problems with his translations of ancient texts and with his understanding of physics."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Si...    Note that the date of Sitchin's birth shows that he would have been a teenager during the years when Philip Wylie's book was most popular.|`|W8tSRZobaa	i think there r more planets in our galaxy but i doubt that the world will end 2012, there has been people saying the end of the world is near for century's, like this September just gone, the world was ment to end then but it didnt. put it this way if the world is gonna end then there is nothing u can do to stop it so just enjoy life :)|`|a6e956d64645c91c661f1a2299cfee7daa	Yes of course.

a4f46446b34cfdac5d337e3a04a5235eaa	Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation  F = G * M1 * M2 / (r^2)   where G is the gravitational constant, = 6.67  10^(?11) N m^2 /kg^2    So force due to the earth (mass Me) on object (mass m) is:  F =G * Me * m / (r^2)   and  F=mg    Hence,  g =G * Me / (r^2)    r is the distance of the object from the center of the earth. As one goes up or down, r changes & hence g changes.    g also changes on the surface of the earth. Why? Due to the fact that earth is not a perfect sphere, and its rotation.    Earth has an oblate shape, r at the radius is > r at the poles. Thus g at the equator is     Earth also rotates and this rotation creates a centrifugal force. This centrifugal force reduces the gravitational force as it acts in the opposite direction. C.F. is maximum at the equator and minimum at the poles(=0).|`|aBvrRc2gaa	Newtons Law of Universal Gravitatation can approximate gravitational force between two bodies of mas M1 and M2 kilograms, with a distance of r metres between their respective centres of mass:    F = M1 * M2 / (r^2) * G  where G is the gravitational constant, G approx 6.67  10?11 N m2 kg-2    So force from the earth (mass M) on object (mass m) is:  F = M * m / (r^2) * G  and acceleration is: a = M / r^2 * G    Hence, different places are at different distances and have varying gravitational acceleration (which is independent of your own mass).    (A small factor is the acceleration from other bodies such as the sun, but as the distances to these bodies are so large, these forces are minute)|`|DWa2DNb5aa	Because the strength of gravity depends on both the amount of mass of the gravitational body that is accelerating an object and on the inverse square of the distance the two bodies are apart.|`|AA11224582	It varies when you change vertical position because your distance from the center of the earth is changing.

SEA8CAHnaa	People with a condition called "Alexandria's Genesis" can have purple eyes...the best link I could find explaining it is below. The problem is that those with the gene have dark-brown or black hair...so hers will have to be dyed and/or highlighted quite a bit- you know, to be realistic.  As for red eyes, well yes, that is also possible (and yes, it's possible without albinism)- but the mathematical probability of these two being brother and sister is beyond astronomical, because of how rare those two mutations are.  Eye color is controlled by polygenes, so it's not so much of a "his mom/dad 'carrying' the gene." The hair colors, other than what I mentioned above for the girl, will check out fine.    On another note, if you want this story to be realistic and not fantasy, you have to make your characters realistic- from the ground up. People don't relate well to characters who seem completely unrealistic, so maybe just one set of odd colored eyes?  Well, I won't tell you how to write, just a tip!

YZAMZFKeaa	It's difficult to isolate all of the water generated in the reaction, especially by extraction. You didn't mention it, but I am guessing that your water recovery was the lower yielding process. A lot of the loss can be probably be attributed to surface tension. Water likes to stick to the sides of glassware while organic solvent do not. I bet your lower water recovery is primarily due to that...    Hiope this helps!!!
AA11618629	Yes - most indefinitely. And the technology does exist, however due to political moral and media coverage the plan will never get off the ground in our life time unless something drastic happens.    Things to cover:  1) Atmosphere:  a) Genetically engineered bacteria is now a present day tool   b) Use machines powered by nuclear reactors to synthesize atmosphere - the access heat can be used to warm up the planet    2) Getting supplies there: this is the only thing stopping us from starting, as the weight of supplies to ship bacteria (need housing for long trip), or machines (just plain heavy) is just very great. But there is one promising method of getting supplies to start the terraform - Look up the Orion Project by NASA, not the Orion shuttle, the "project."    It used mini nuclear warheads as means of propulsion- now you see the problem, the fall out during left off is expected to kill 1 - 10 people, out of the 6.5 billion people we have on earth. You might be saying hey 1000's of people die in Africa every year what difference will 1- 10 make?    Well the 1- 10 does not care weather your a hobo or the president. Not only that, people are just plain panzes these days- the technology for Orion project does indeed exist, we could if we wanted- transport an entire city (dirt and all) up to mars in as little as one month, but people are just afraid that the 1- 10 people who die will be someone important up in office.    Know to help you see the difference of 10 people:  Before: 6,512,965,396  After:--- 6,512,965,386  - can't you SEE the difference?-    But in the far far future we most definitely will - some genius is going to try weather 1 or 10 people will die from fallout.

I mean, you can get out a planetarium program, set it for Aug 2004, the time of day and direction.  Something might pop out.    But both of these sound like they could have been satellites.  If you haven't seen an Iridium flare, go to    http://www.heavens-above.com/    register (it's free), set your location, go back to the home page and look up Iridium Flares.  Then go out and look.    I saw one brighten to maybe mag -4, like Venus, and continue to brighten even though it ducked behind a cloud. Then it was gone - having dropped into the Earth's shadow.  It was suppose  to get to -9.  And i believe it.  I've only seen the Moon punch through clouds like that.  And it would have been a UFO if i hadn't known, in advance, that this was a satellite.

If you wanted to break a pencil, how would you do it?  Pull on the ends?  Push on the ends? Or bend it?  (Beams can carry tension, compression, or bending)    Most materials are strong in compression or tension.  The truss in theory is built with cables and rods.  This is done by putting "pins" at all the joints so that the cables and rods  can't be bent by the design loads.

54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	One thing you have to consider is that lizards are cold-blooded.  They move around in order to control their temperature.  So one basic requirement for keeping a lizard is that you have to have part of the cage warmer and part of the cage cooler, so it can move back and forth, at least in the daytime.  You can do this by using a basking lamp on one part of the cage; an incandescent bulb makes heat and makes a warm spot. Or you can buy a heat rock at the pet store.  Lizards need a warm spot especially after they have eaten, to help them digest their food.  When you get a lizard, you have to find out what temperatures they need, and make sure the cage has the right range of temperatures.  Of course lizards need water to drink.  Most lizards eat bugs.  You can buy crickets and meal worms at a pet store.  Lizards, except for tiny babies, do not eat every day.  You will have to try your lizard and see if it will eat.  If not, try again next day.  Keep trying until it eats.  Notice how much it eats.  This is how you figure out how often to feed it and how much to feed it.  Lizards tend to eat more, and more often, in summer than in winter; so you have to be flexible.  If you don't want to turn the bugs loose in the cage, you can do what I do.  I put the lizard and the bugs in a big plastic box (or the bathtub would do) and leave them together 10 minutes.  If the lizard doesn't eat in that time, it's not hungry.    To keep your crickets, you need to have a container for them that they can't get out of, and give them something to eat.  They will eat a lot of things.  I feed them a piece of dry dog or cat food, or some dry cereal.  Put in a piece of wet cotton or paper towel for them to get a drink.  They will drown in a dish of water.  Keeping mealworms is easier.  Just keep them in a container of oatmeal or wheat germ.  You will probably buy them in the container with food.  Some can be refrigerated, others not.  Below is a good website for care of leopard geckos.  P.S. a heat rock or basking lamp for a gecko is not going to make your electric bill sky high.  It is just like one little heated spot.  But do consider that you will need to keep buying food.|`|fMFWOB7Qaa	They are reptiles which means they require a heat rock or heating lamp for warmth. Very important!

A plesiosaur could not have come out of the water.    However, plesiosaurs have long been considered extinct, and extinct long before humans started to live on earth.

Multiplication is just repeated addition. 3*(2 1/2) = (2 1/2) + (2 1/2) + (2 1/2) = 7 1/2.    2. The toll was $3.25. Subtract $1 for the driver and you have $2.25. Subtract $.75 three times and you get to zero, so the car had four people in it (including the driver).    3.  Here's how I do these in my head:  Start at 7:42AM.  After 18 minutes, you're at 8:00AM  After 4:18, you're at noon  After 14:18, you're at 10PM  After 14:28, you're at 10:10PM.

sLEoWYr5aa	It may eventually, it's because the pressure in space is so low that the boiling points of your bodily fluids are so low that your blood would boil. You can actually survive in space for a very short while, if you are in space for under 20 seconds and then restored to a pressurized container you could escape with no permanent damage.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	No, you will just loose your consciousness and die after about 90 seconds.     You will not explode, also your blood will not boil. But your lungs would get damaged. Your body will swell, but your skin is made to withstand worse punishment.|`|2ef5ca5a39098769a8dac8a2f3c15f57aa	Yes it is true.  Your blood is a liquid.  It has vapor pressure.  It remains liquid because atmospheric pressure is greater than the vapor pressure of your blood.    If you remove the pressure exerted on your body by the atmosphere, your blood will no longer remain in the liquid phase.  It will boil and seek to escape your body.  Your head may not actually explode if your blood can find another way out of your body.  The end result will be the same.    You do not have to go all the way to outer space to experience this.  Atmospheric pressure at about 60,000 feet is low enough to allow your blood to boil.  Pilots of spy planes, such as the U2, had to wear pressure suits similar to those of astronauts because they flew at altitudes above that.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	If you go into space without a helmet,pretty soon you will be a beat sucker.|`|ERqP6TgOaa	How long can a human live unprotected in space?    If you don't try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, you're dying. The limits are not really known.    You do not explode and your blood does not boil because of the containing effect of your skin and circulatory system. You do not instantly freeze because, although the space environment is typically very cold, heat does not transfer away from a body quickly. Loss of consciousness occurs only after the body has depleted the supply of oxygen in the blood. If your skin is exposed to direct sunlight without any protection from its intense ultraviolet radiation, you can get a very bad sunburn.    At NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (now renamed Johnson Space Center) we had a test subject accidentally exposed to a near vacuum (less than 1 psi) in an incident involving a leaking space suit in a vacuum chamber back in '65. He remained conscious for about 14 seconds, which is about the time it takes for O2 deprived blood to go from the lungs to the brain. The suit probably did not reach a hard vacuum, and we began repressurizing the chamber within 15 seconds. The subject regained consciousness at around 15,000 feet equivalent altitude. The subject later reported that he could feel and hear the air leaking out, and his last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil.    Aviation Week and Space Technology (02/13/95) printed a letter by Leonard Gordon which reported another vacuum-packed anecdote:    "The experiment of exposing an unpressurized hand to near vacuum for a significant time while the pilot went about his business occurred in real life on Aug. 16, 1960. Joe Kittinger, during his ascent to 102,800 ft (19.5 miles) in an open gondola, lost pressurization of his right hand. He decided to continue the mission, and the hand became painful and useless as you would expect. However, once back to lower altitudes following his record-breaking parachute jump, the hand returned to normal."    this statement from a NASA website shows that you chemistry teacher needs to go back to school....only word i would use to describe him is an idiot..|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Your head wouldn't actually explode, but if you failed to let the air out of your lungs then things could nevertheless get...kinda messy. Not to mention extremely dangerous.|`|9GMePSopaa	I don't know what your teacher is talking about :S    At the Earth's surface, air pressure is very high, which is what our bodies are 'designed' to survive under. Higher and lower pressures have big effects.    Have you ever been deep underwater, and you feel as though your head is about to implode and you get a horrible pain throughout it? That's due to ever increasing pressure above you as you get deeper.    Or have you ever sucked the air out of a bottle, and it looks as though it's being crushed?  This is because the air inside the bottle has been removed and so it collapses under the air pressure.    Well take this the other way -   When you go into space, there's no local atmosphere and thus no large pressure on your body. Due to this, your body will expand ... and it'll hurt :)|`|NgUbzaF9aa	No, you're head won't explode. The human body can withstand survival in space for no more then 2 minutes; even one minute is pushing it. The pressure that a vacuum in space causes will render you unconscious the second your helmet is taken off. Your body will also be subjected to the violent difference between the hot and cold temperatures.    Let's say half of your body is facing the sun, and the other half is facing darkness. One half of your body will be freezing, while the other half will be boiling. Not to mention mini-asteroids that zip around Earth's atmosphere, they will pelt into your body and begin to rip you apart in tiny bits.    There's no explanation for your head exploding. The pressure in space will merely make you pass out. So that's the least of your worries anyway.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Basically the air inside your body will violently expand in a vacuum like space so technically it could be classed as an explosion.  Also you're blood would boil.|`|mH1Tnv5Naa	I don't think your head would explode, but the sudden drop in outside pressure would cause a large differential in pressure from the inside of your body to the outside.  The air would likely burst forth out of your lungs and your body tissues would "boil" since the pressure would fall to essentially zero.  However your cranium would probably be strong enough to prevent your head from exploding.|`|LXiBCERZaa	you have about 30 seconds, it's possible to survive up to a minute, but you are going to be hurting pretty bad. You aren't going to explode like you see in a bunch of movies.

Sort of like:    XXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXXX    When you melt it, you break down the crystalline structure. This renders it into a liquid.

In a substance, the molecules are held together by intermolecular forces (note : forces, not bonds) and it is the breaking of these forces which causes a change of state.    That is the basic version, if you want more detail then read below.    The most common type of intermolecular force is the Van-der-Waals force. It acts between all atoms and molecules at all times and is caused by the random displacement of electrons occasionally creating attractive charges with other molecules.    The next most common one is the Permanent Dipole force. Atoms have a property called electronegativity - an atom's "capability to attract electrons to itself" - Nitrogen, Oxygen and Fluorine are the most electronegative elements). Electronegative atoms will gain an overall negative charge in a molecule, and the less electronegative atoms will become positively charged. The attraction between positive parts of one molecule and negative parts of another molecule is a type of intermolecular force.    The next main type is Hydrogen Bonding. Because hydrogen only has one electron, when it is in a molecule with an electronegative atom it gains a very strong positive charge, which then attracts negative parts of other molecules. This is the strongest of the three forces I have mentioned.    All of these forces act over a limited range, so when you heat a substance, giving it more energy - thus causing the particles to move about - the intermolecular forces will begin to break, causing the particles to no longer attract together. Solids are substances with a large amount of intermolecular forces intact, liquids have less, and gases have the least.
VqKHo47haa	You want to keep evaporation to a minimum as much as possible. Evaporation is caused by heat and vapor pressure. Heat obviously causes liquids to go to gas, and alcohol is no exception. Infact ethanol boils at a lower temp than water. To counter this effect consider using a mixture of liquids instead of pure alcohol. Dont use pure water because that will allow bacteria to invade and degrade your sample. At the same time you want enough so that it will decrease the vapor pressure of the ethanol. How about 70% ethanol, 30% water?

Therefore, we have the number 2/7 and know that it's reciprocal is 7/2.  When these two numbers are multiplied together, we get 1 since the result is 14/14 and is another form of 1.    I hope that helps you out!  Please let me know if you have any other questions!
22a294c1434a5299116a37d21b3e6ce9aa	Well to get the first question into a position where you can add them, you first need to change the mixed number fraction, into a top-heavy fraction. To do this you take the denominator and multiply it by the whole number, then add on the numerator. So 4 x 1 = 4, 4 + 3 = 7. So then you put 7 over the original denominator, so your first fraction is 7/4. Do this to the second fraction too, and you should get 12/5.    Now, you need to find a common denominator for both of these fractions to be able to add them together. So the lowest common denominator would be 20. You multiplied  4 (the denominator) by 5 to get to the common denominator, 20; so then you have to multiply the numerator by 5 too. So your first fraction is 35/20. Do this with the second fraction and you should get 48/20.     Next, add 35/20 and 48/20 together, and get 83/20. Now find out how many times 20 goes into 83, and how many you have left over. So 20 into 83 goes 4 times with 3 left over. So your answer = 4 3/20. You cant cancel this down so leave it as it is.    --------------------------------------...    To do your second question, it is much simpler. All you have to do to divide a fraction, is change the divison sign to a multiplication sign, and then flip your second fraction over. So you will do 2/9 x 3/10.  Then you simply multiply the numerators together, so that 2 x 3 = 6  Multiply the denominator and it equals 90. So your fraction is 6/90. Remember to cancel down your fraction, so 6/90 = 2/30 = 1/15    So the answer for your second question is 1/15    Sorry if this confuses you, it has confused me reading over what I have written, and most of it probably doesn't make sense to anyone but me; hope I helped though =]|`|1e8f9a70b81ba191472efb5cd4e71038aa	Question 1  35/20 + 48/20  83/20  4  3/20  OR  3 + 15/20 + 8/20  3 + 23/20  3 + 1  3/20  4  3/20    Question 2  2/9 x 3/10 = 6/90 = 1/15|`|ngfPNolpaa	1  15/20  + 2  8/20 = 3 23/20 = 4  3/20    (2/9)(3/10) = 6/90 = 1/15|`|6pksPo7Zaa	7/4 + 12/5=  35/20 +48/20=  83/20 = 4 3/20      2/9 div 10/3=  2/9x3/10 =  6/90  1/15|`|iaHM24Xjaa	well 1 3/4 + 2 2/5 = 7/4 + 12/5 = 35/20 + 48/20 = 83/20 or 4 3/20    2/9 divided by 10/3 = 2/9*3/10 = 6/90 = 2/30 = 1/15    Hope this helped!|`|lseXWdgLaa	to add fractions the denominator must be the same    so for 1 3/4 + 2 2/5  find equivalent denominators while not changing the value  so a common multiple between 4 and 5 is 20 since 4*5=20    and so we multiply the top and bottom of 3/4 by 5  and the top and bottom of 2/5 by 4    you get 3/4--->15/20  and 2/5--->8/20    so it is now 1 15/20 + 2 8/20  adding the whole numbers you get 3    and add the fractions together 15/20 + 8/20   which is 23/20  change this into a mixed number... 1 3/20  and then proceed to add the 3 wholes to that  to get 4 3/20 as your answer    answer: 4 3/20    for 2/9 divided by 10/3....  to divide fractions simply multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction  so we take the reciprocal of 10/3 which is 3/10  then multiply 2/9 *3/10  6/90  this is equivalent to 2/9 divided by 10/3    answer:  6/90    simplified:  3/45 = 1/15
sZeBrVLVaa	Is this a trick question? Either that or I don't understand it. Surely if the train is already 4 min late then in another 26 min it will be half an hour late?|`|6rR7LTl1aa	It's already 4 minutes late, so it has to run behind an additional 26 minutes.    4 seconds into 26 minutes, and 15 4-second periods per minute:  4*15*26/4 = 15*26 = the time it takes to fall 26 more minutes behind schedule, making it exactly half an hour late.    That's 390 minutes, for the arithmetically challenged.|`|Oy5kkxrxaa	If the train loses 4 seconds every minute, how many minutes until it's lost 30 minutes.    Let m be the number of minutes until the train is a full 30 minutes late.    4/60 * m = 26  m = 60 * 26 / 4   = 15 * 26   = 390    So in 390 more minutes, the train will be 30 mins late.|`|MK129BdDaa	390 minuits i think, not entirely sure though|`|AA10969890	4sec x 30 = 120 sec = 2 minutes  and 4 minutes late    so total = 4 + 2 = 6 minutes|`|AEaN34Etaa	Yes it is 390:    There are 1800 seconds in half an hour. (30 minutes x 60 seconds)  The train is already 4 minutes late. This is 240 seconds (4 minutes x 60 seconds).    Therefore to work out how many minutes the train needs to be running late we must do the following:  Take away 240 seconds from 1800 seconds. This gives 1560.  If the train is losing 4 seconds a minute then we must divide 1560 by 4 to get 390. This is the answer to the question.    If we then work backwards we can prove this.    Multiply 390 by 4 to get 1560 again.  Divide this by 60 to get the number of minutes.  This equates to 24. Add the 4 minutes it is already late and it comes to 30 as the question stated.    Hope this helps.
UySiU0LSaa	No such thing as evolution mate.|`|cj4nIaQTaa	Your are right something had to have happened very suddenly to kill and cover the animals/ plants spontaneously. Perhaps volcanic activity, the great flood...etc. Although this assumption makes very good sence I dont see why it has anything to do with evolution.|`|AA11014910	Are you so sure there are no fossils being formed right now?

At this moment, there are millions of fossils and soon to be fossils at varying stages of fossilization in the world.  Any examination of long standing sedimentary layers will show this.     But it's difficult to become a fossil. OBVIOUSLY not every animal or plant that dies will be fossilized. First you have to die around water (generally, there other are ways like mumification, but we won't talk about that).  Lets take a tree by a river.  So a tree branch falls into the river.  It's covered by mud over the years.  This mud seals out oxygen and prevents bacteria from destroying the tree.  Over time more mud covers the tree and after millions of years minerals leach into the tissue of the tree replacing the biological material.  The fossil is compressed through the weight of higher layers of mud, mud forming rock and rock.  It's possible that the compression may occur so long that the sedimentary rock housing the fossil is compressed into metamorphic rock.  Or if we're lucky, the former riverbed will be thrust up through the action of plate tectonics.  This exposes the band of sediment containing the fossil, allowing us to see it.  To answer your question about compression, the weight of the rock on top of the fossil and resulting compressive powers is what results in the mashed skeletons we often find.    Because of the stack of conditions that must be met for an organism to be fossilized, it's statistically unlikely any one individual organism will become a fossil.  However, there are BILLIONS of organisms out there, so statistically, some WILL be fossilized and preserved.  This low probability of fossilization is why the fossil record is relatively sparse and why it is so exciting when we find transitional forms, like the dawn horse sequence or the whale ancestry line.      But I probably just wasted my time, from the tone of your question, I doubt the depth or breadth of my answer matters.  Have fun being ignorant.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	If you are really interested in the process of fossilization go to your librarian and tell her that you want to learn about it.  You can also Google fossilization process.  Fossils are rare and certain special conditions are required to create them.  Are you saying that you think all fossils are fake or something?  People are making them in their basements and then hiding them underground?|`|QLPyLRrDaa	Maybe that's something that actually happened but wouldn't the sharks survive the flood?|`|bg86ji6naa	Its not true. It is just made up by smart people to throw dumb people off their trail. There have never been any fossils found. I mean it makes sense right? We find fossils millions of years old but animals die today and they dont immediately turn to fossils.     In case you didnt notice i was joking. If every animal or plant formed a fossil then the entire planet would be covered in fossils. Only the "lucky" ones turn into a fossil.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	open a bloody science book.. You obviously don't know anything about science.. Fossils are created over time, a VERY VERY long time.. Not in a matter of days, months, years...

It happens to a select few organisms.|`|De4vgWXPaa	>    They are being made today where the conditions for fossilization are right.  This detail makes the rest of your "question" irrelevant.

TqtzzsHjaa	I have done AS maths, and i have to say I personally found it quite easy. i found that mechanics is harder than statistics though.    first year maths we did, the following:  C1  C2  S1/M1    C1 is just basically expansion on what you did at gcse. nothing really that new. except for binomial distribution, and thats about it really.    C2 has new concepts in it, yet still easy i found. it includes differentiation, integration, logarithms and some other things i cant remember.    M1 is kinda hard i guess, dealing with objects on a slope, suvat equations, etc.    S1 i found to be allright,. probability etc. mostly what you learnt if you did stats at school. also new concepts.

You can give it a try though initially and see if it works for you.|`|Hx39uEz6aa	Well, that partly depends on which med school you go to. Some med schools like Liverpool run a purely PBL (problem based learning) course which has only a small amount of contact time during the week, but there is much more self directed learning to be done... so there might be time to do work a few hours a week.... but the job would certainly need to be flexible. I'm in my second year at med school, and here we have a lot of contact during the week, and for me there would be no chance of working other than the weekend.... and even then you'd have to be super organised with your time to make it work.  Personally i need all the time i can get to study outside of lectures, so i wouldn't recommend the added stress of a job.  Best of luck if you do go on to medicine! it is a great subject!!|`|2WYvz73xaa	It is feasible but you need to keep it to a minimum and work smart.  I knew a number of accelerated med school students who did it but they never seemed to have a student life.  This may not have bothered them too much as they seemed more mature and focused, or had already worked and had a stash of cash behind them and work for fun cos they can do everything and still shine at med school - all hail!!    When I say work smart, I mean to be a multi-tasker.  For example, you could hometutor A level chemistry or biology to keep your science up to scratch and you won't need to do additional background work.  You may consider writing articles or essays for medical student prizes.  Go for those that are relevant to the subject area that you are concurrently studying at med school.  This way you get money, "free" studying and swot up all rolled into one!  Some student prizes can be as big as 300 and the BMJ can offer 50 per article.  Another advantage is that your CV will be boosted for winning prizes and getting things published, which would be great for your Foundation year application!    Good luck!!
3ZPYB7nxaa	/////////////// FIRST, A WORD FROM OUR SPONCER    Molarity    A mole is nothing more than a number chemists use to express weight. For example, 1 mole of Nitrogen atoms weigh 14 grams. Oxygen will be 16 grams per mole and Hydrogen only 1 gram. What applies to atoms also applies to molecules. Molecular weight is the sum of atomic weights. Ammonia (NH3) is the sum of 1 Nitrogen atom and 3 Hydrogen atoms, or 14 + 3 = 17 grams/mole.    ///////////// we now return to our regurarly assigned assignment    4NH3 + 5O2  4NO + 6H2O    What the equation is literally saying above is "4 moles of ammonia combine with 5 moles of Oxygen (gas) to form 4 moles of Nitrogen monoxide and 6 moles of water."  Therefore, if 4 moles of ammonia make  -------------- ?????    //////////////////// technical difficulties, please stand by    -hey, where's the nitric acid? All I can see is "NO", not "HNO3".  I will therefore assume there has been some mistake. Maybe the equation really is:    NH3 + 2O2  HNO3 + H2O    ///////////// we now return to our regurarly assigned assignment    What the equation is literally saying above is "1 mole of ammonia combines with 2 moles of Oxygen (gas) to form a mole of Nitric acid and a mole of water."  Therefore, if a mole of ammonia makes a mole of Nitric acid, then of course 10 moles of NH3 will make 10 moles of Nitric acid.    When given a certain amount of one of the reactants, the weight of the products can be calculated if everything is expressed in moles. Since ammonia weighs 17 grams/mole, (10 gm)/(17 gm/mole) = 0.588 moles NH3. One will also produce 0.588 moles of HNO3, since there is a 1 to 1 relationship between them.    This is all you need to know to finish the rest of the problem. Good luck!|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	Help or do it for you? If you want help, what in particular do you need help with?|`|iZdh54S8aa	the first one is a. 10 since n(NH3)/4 = n(NO)/4     ---> n(NH3)=n(NO)    for the second one  the molar mass of ammonia is 17 g/mol  so n(NH3)=n(NO)=mass/molar mass=10/17=0.588 moles  so the answer is d    for the third one:  the molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol  so n(O2)=mass/molar mass=10/32=0.3125 mol  and n(O2)/5=n(NO)/4 (by stoichiometric ratio)  then n(NO)=5/4 * 0.3125 = 0.391 moles  so the answer is b    for the forth one: the limiting reagent is the reactant that gives less products for the same number of grams (mass), in this case oxygen.  so the answer is c    hope that helps =)

This is why we're told that the world will be "ending in ten years!" and stuff like that.      They would LOVE it if you got rid of your car and NEVER drove again.  Will they give up THEIR cars?  No WAY!  They have places to go and things to do!    Dude below, how would you be able to COOK your food if they turn off and knock down the power plants?  Going to cook by campfire?  *laughter*  THAT would produce more pollution than the power plant when you scale that up to EVERYONE needing a campfire to cook his food.

Therefore, protons, the lightest baryons, do not decay into anything.    That said, we're still looking for evidence of proton decay (and hence slight non-conservation of baryon number).  Some grand unified theories predict it.  Also, unless you believe the universe just started with the excess of baryons vs. anti-baryons it has now, it seems probable that there was some non-conservation early in the universe.

When you draw the diagonal from one corner of the square to the other corner, you end up with two triangles. Since each corner of the square is a right angle, you know that the triangles are right triangles. You also know that for a right triangle you can use Pythagorea's formula to find any side of the triangle using:  (side 1)^2 (side2)^2 = (hypothenuse)^2.  For this problem we know that the diagonal is the hypothenuse of the triagles, so the hypothenuse = 12 cm. Since we have a square, the two sides of the triangle are equal, so side1 = side2.   Substitute and Plug into formula: (side1)^2 + (side1)^2 = (12)^2  compute: 2*(side1)^2 = 144  (side1)^2 = 72  side1 = SQRT(72) = 8.49  You know perimeter of square = 4 x side1.   So P = 4 x SQRT(72) = 4 x 8.49 = 33.96 cm.  That's it.

mH1Tnv5Naa	It's not really the wet ground or what's in the air, but it is a matter of the temperature of the atmosphere above your location.  To get snow you first need to produce it in the clouds, then as the flakes fall the temperature needs to stay below freezing at lest most of the way to the ground.  If at any time during the falling, the flakes encounter a layer of air that is above freezing, they may melt.  Coastal areas tend to have more difficulty getting snow because the adjacent water tends to keep the lower atmosphere warmer than further inland, as well as the atmosphere tends to be warmer due to being near sea level.

First you have to look at what makes up a major pandemic.   First - transmissibility. How readily is the contagion spread?   Second: How sustainable is the contagion outside of the host.   Third - How viable is the contagion in the host to reproduce to a disease producing/lethal cfu?   Fourth - what is the lag time from exposure to onset?     Bioweapons have been toyed with for decades but have not been deployed on the battlefield for one or more of the four reasons listed above. If a virus or bacteria is highly infectious and persistant then it would render the territory uninhabitable post-conflict. If it is non-persistant then the initial dose must either be very high or the contagion highly virilent. The first is impractical and the latter too dangerous to be handled. Thus, bioweapons are more of a fear weapon than a practical one.     Nature, however, is unrestrained in its efforts to test out the latest morph of a virus. I can think of several deviations from wild-type bacteria that would be quite dangerous but none that could be potentially as lethal as the Marburg Virus. The putative host is unknown but the effect is lethal in >25% of those infected. Those that survive suffer long term damage to the solid organs - and - potentially act as a reservoir for the domant virus. The infection dose required is small, it can be transmitted from person to person easilly and from the environment, it is sustainable outside of the host and there is neither an anti-viral drug nor any immunization against it.     The only curious thing about it is that it seems to run its own course and goes dormant and is geographically isolated to central Africa. If this virus were to go active and stay active then it would be a lethal pandemic.
AA10655250	Cryptically called the Sargasso Sea because of mysterious ship and airplane vanishings.    The Sargasso Sea occupies that part of the Atlantic from roughly 70 degrees West to 40 degrees West, and from 25 degrees North to 35 degrees North. It is in complete contrast to the ocean around it. Its currents are largely immobile yet surrounded by some of the strongest currents in the world: The Florida, Gulf Stream, Canary, North Equatorial, Antilles, and Caribbean currents. These interlock to separate this sea from the rest of the tempestuous Atlantic, making its indigenous currents  largely entropious. Therefore anything that drifts onto any of its surrounding currents eventually ends up in the Sargasso Sea amidst its expansive weed mats of sargassum. Because of the entropious currents, it is unlikely anything would ever drift out.     The Sargasso Sea rotates slightly itself and even changes position as its surrounding currents change with weather and temperature patterns during different seasons.     For centuries the Sargasso Sea was dreaded by the seafaring because of its deadly calms.  Many times the Spanish found themselves becalmed for weeks, being then forced to jettison their war horses in order to conserve water. Hence the area known as the Horse Latitudes traverse the Sargasso Sea.     Another name would be the Doldrums.  The sargassum could even contribute to stalling a vessel during these long periods of weak winds. And today props on smaller boats can be fouled by the weed mats, causing them go dead in the middle of nowhere.    Owing to surface currents, the Sargasso accumulates a high concentration of non-biodegradable plastic waste. This huge vortex of garbage is similar to another ocean phenomena, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.    The Sargasso Sea is the only "sea" without shores.      See the links below for additional information.  Hope this helps.

It is a dangerous place for boats and planes for a number of reasons. Shallow water 100 miles from land has destroyed more than one vessel who's crew thought they were in deep water. The Gulf Stream runs right through the middle of it so debris from wrecks is quickly disperssed across the ocean. Those currents also get in between the islands causing all sorts of strange sea and weather conditions. A number of magnetic anomalies are also known throughout the region which can make a compass useless. Bad if you're in an airplane during IFR conditions.

K6QlFoo0aa	f(x) = 7*sec(x) + 2*e^x*tan(x)  -----------------------------  There are three trig identities for differential calculus that you have to know.    (1)  d(e^x) / dx = e^x    (2)  d(tan(x)) = sec^2(x)    (3)  d(sec(x)) = sec(x)*tan(x)    If you haven't yet memorized them, it would be a good idea to do so.  Many students know the derivative of the tangent so I will compute the derivative of the sec(x) for you    Note;  If you don't know this the derivative of tan(x) is found by applying the quotient rule to [sin(x) / cos(x)].  ----------------------------------    The derivative of sec(x) is found by knowing that sec(x) = 1 / cos(x) and that:    (1 / cos(x)) = (cos(x))^-1.      Since the internal derivative, that of the cos(x) is -sin(x) that is a factor in the derivative.      Since the derivative of ("anything")^-1 = -("anything")^-2:    d ((cos(x)^(-1))) / dx = -sin(x) * - ((cos(x))^(-2)) =       +sin(x) / (cos^2(x)) =     [sin(x) / cos(x)] * [1 / cos(x)] =    tan(x) * sec(x)  ----------------------    Now on to your problem:    f(x) = 7 * sec(x) + 2e^x * tan(x)    1) d (7*sec(x)/dx = 7tan(x)*sec(x) as I just proved...identity (3)    2)  Apply the product rule to 2e^x * tan(x)    u = 2e^x  du/dx = 2e^x.....This is from identity (1)    v = tan(x)  dv/dx = sec^2(x).....This is from identity (2)    Since the product rule states that:  d(u*v)/dx = u*dv/dx + v*du/dx    d(2e^x * tan(x))/dx =     [(2*(e^(x))) * (sec^2(x))]] + [2*(e(x)) * (tan(x))]...  .....u..................dv/dx............    If you wish to do so this can be rewritten (by factoring) as:    [2*(e^x)] * [(sec^2(x)) + (tan(x))]....  --------------------------    And the final answer (not forgetting about the 7*sec(x)*tan(x)) is:    { [7*(sec(x)) * (tan(x))] + [2*(e^x)] * [(sec^2(x)) + (tan(x))] }...  .|`|DJD4HzPjaa	7sec(x)tan(x)+2{e^(x) * sec^2(x) + e^(x) * tanx}

199ccf77f95816e7630fe288143d7190aa	The shock from shock metamorphism is caused by kinetic energy, which is not influenced by the composition of the meteor.  Kinetic energy is a function of the object's mass and impact velocity.  Thus a 10 ton ball of iron will create the same overpressure as a 10 ton ball of ice.  Granted, the 10 ton ball of ice will be less dense and so the pressure will be spread out over a larger area, but the chemistry of the impact object will not influence the minerals formed.    Presence of water in the original rocks before they are metamorphosed will affect their end composition, but that is another process.
SEA8CAHnaa	The VERY first thing you'll have to do is get a degree in ornithology, the study of birds. It's a sub-field in biology, so at the undergraduate level, a degree in biology with a concentration in ornithology may be as close as you can get... here's the thing though.  Most colleges don't have more than one or a few ornithology classes, so you'll probably have to find a small enough undergraduate school with an orno prof you have reasearched and like (someone who has studeied african greys, perhaps?) and, once at that school, create a realationship with that professor.  This way, you can help the prof with his/her research, and be "taken under their wing," so to speak (pun intended, ha). This will greatly help in your pursuit of a masters and PhD in the field.  Anywho...that is similar to what I did with my Ornithology Professor, (Professor Barnard at Norwich University) who was awesome, even though I ended up going after a Medical Degree!|`|a9da82d7c02f0d0c2e3f006a101c69c4aa	Dr. Pepperberg actually has her degree in chemistry.  She just happened to luck into Alex and her research (if you want to call it luck).  She was trying to prove that previously used learning paradigms did not work because they were faulty and not due to any lack in the species (in this case, parrot species in general).      In general you are interested in comparative cognition or pychobiology.  However, since this is my field, i can tell you that if you go in with the intent of "studying African Grey's" you will never get anywhere.  That is not how the field or academics work.  You need to be interested in the topic and the study of the species is secondary.     There is no scientific study of "interspecies communication" we are interested in the evolution of cognitive processes.  Interspecies communiation is just another name for positive reinforcement which has been studied to death already (psychology 101).      Appropriate degrees would be bioanthro (with a concentration in Primatology) or psychology with interests in developmental, comparative and psychobiology.  Your best bet is to find researchers conducting some research of interest and apply to those schools.      A good book to learn more about this subject is Wild Minds by Marc Hauser.  Just be aware, although he is excellent at explaining concepts, he is lousy with facts.  If you don't like Wild Minds, may I suggest you find another area of interest.

f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	I'm not sure what the -3, -0, -1, -2 are supposed to mean, but you can only draw one line containing three collinear points. Indeed, for any two distinct points, there's only one line that passes through both points.    Of course, there are countless different ways to write the equation of such a line, but if you graph them (or algebraically manipulate the equations), they all turn out to be the same line.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	I'm not sure I understand your question.  Two unique, collinear points define a line.  You can draw as many other lines as you want, but they will be (1) the same as the first line, or (2) go through zero or one of the identified points.    Did you mean "coplanar" points?|`|kSh03sCHaa	Just 1.  The points are collinear    If they weren't collinear, the answer would be 3. You'd  could make 1 line using the 1st and 2nd point, another with  the 1st and 3rd point, and a third one using the 2nd and 3rd point.

4RJKl1aKaa	Personally, I wouldn't bother with either of these scopes.  My standard advice is that you can't get a useful scope for under $200.  Anything less tends to be unusably shaky and have substandard optics.  Both of these give the impression of being to shaky for real use.      The Bushnell for instance is quoted as weighing 12.5 lbs - that is way too light.  12.5 kilograms would be on the light side of being genuinely useful for a scope of that size.  For comparison I own a slightly larger 5.1" Newt that comes in at just over 18 kilograms and even that is merely usable rather than solid.  If your telescope mount is shaky it doesn't matter how good the optics are since you are never going to get a stable image.    As for the second scope, 76mm put simply is too small for a reflector.  A spherical mirror is a bad sign - you want a parabolic mirror for best results but those are more expensive to manufacture.  The focal ratio of this scope is longer than average presumably in an attempt to compensate for the spherical mirror.    The aperture ratio 1:9,2 is what is generally known as the focal ratio: this is an f/9.2 scope.  It is on a German site and it appears they haven't got that translation right.    In summary, if you are restricted to $100 or less, don't buy a telescope since good scopes simply aren't cheap.  A decent pair of binos are the way to go, and a good guide book to the night sky with binoculars.|`|f1beDbKIaa	69 Euros = 88.5891 U.S. dollars    In both cases, it's not the optics i'd be concerned about.  It's the mount.  The cheap and stable mount design is the dobsonian.  It's also an Alt-Az mount as these are, but sits on the ground rather than on a tripod.  And you end up with a really stable mount.  It pretty much requires a Newtonian style telescope, so that the eyepiece is in a reasonable spot.    At least these are not EQ mounts.  There are no stable EQ mounts, even without a telescope, for the kind of money you're looking at.    This is my current lowest cost excellent telescope suggestion.  It's unfortunately two or three times what you've been looking at.    http://www.telescope.com/control/product...    And though you can find great suggestions here, you should really attempt to check out a local astronomy club.  Most clubs have a public star party every month, even in winter. You can judge for yourself what different telescopes will show you, and how easy (or not) they are to work with.    http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...|`|QKO4f5q0aa	Since you're looking at reflectors, I'd go with a larger aperture, but with a dobsononian mount.   Those are both pretty small aperture scopes.    6 - 8 inch (150 - 200mm) Dobs are good starter scopes. Easy to use, fast to set up and tear down, and you don't spend forever trying to get the mount aligned with North.     You can get an 8 inch Dob for under $400.  If you're not ready to spend that much yet, I'd suggest a good pair of binoculars to start with.    See my page below for more 'beginners tips'    Followup: The aperture ratio is the same as the f/number you will see elsewhere.  1:9,2 means that the focal length is 9,2 times the aperture.  For your 76mm scope (the second one) that is 699,2mm or 27.5 inches.   This will roughly correspond with the length of the telescope tube.|`|G3LpGWXbaa	Stay away from the short tube. Short focal length mirrors are harder to make and therefore are generally lower quality. I would recommend spending a little more to get a 6 aperture. The mount is another important factor in a good scope. A beginner may have more luck with a dobsonian mount rather than a german equatorial (GEM). Cheap GEMs tend to be shaky. Solid GEMs tend to be expensive. Check out telescope.com (Orion). They generally have good optics and decent prices.

8i31I09uaa	Hi,  From the combustion, the amount of C and H can be calculated. The rest is then presumed to be oxygen, as it is combusted in air (which is where some of the oxygen comes from). So for 1....    6.61 g of CO2 / 44 (molecular weight of CO2) = 0.15 moles of CO2 * 12 (atomic mass of C) = 1.80 g    2. 0.15 moles    3. Water (H2O) = 4.07 g / 18 = 0.226 moles of H2O.  = 0.452 moles of H (as there are 2 hydrogen atoms per water)  Mass of H's = 0.452 moles * 1 = 0.452 g     Therefore remaining weight unaccounted for (and thus must be oxygen) = 4.66 g - 0.452 g - 1.80 g = 2.408g  Moles of oxygen = 2.408 g / 16 = 0.151 moles    Therefore the ratios (in moles) of C : H : O is 0.15 : 0.45 : 0.15  = 1:3:1  Therefore the empirical formula is CH3O    Hope this helps|`|w2pK1HGSaa	i double checked the empirical formula and i got the same thing as the person above me  =)   CH3O

QNyztmU3aa	There are a couple more fun divisibility rules that you can teach her.  Here's a few that I am aware of:    7: Take a positive integer.  Take off the last digit of the integer, double it, and subtract the result from the remaining digits.  Then the result is a multiple of 7 if and only if the original number was a multiple of 7.  You can use this trick to handle really big numbers by applying the method over and over.  Example: take the number n1 = 647836.  Form n2 = 64783 - 2*6 = 64783 - 12 = 64771.  The rule says that n1 is a multiple of 7 if and only if n2 is; so let's use the rule on n2.  Form n3 = 6477 - 2*1 = 6475.  Then form n4 = 647 - 2*5 = 647 - 10 = 637.  Finally, write n5 = 63 - 2*7 = 63 - 14 = 49.  Through repeated applications of the rule, we know that n1 is a multiple of 7 if and only if n5 is, and since 49 = 7*7 we can conclude that 647836 is also a multiple of 7.  Sure enough, 647836 = 92548 * 7.    11: The general rule for 11 is that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the "alternating sum" of its digits is a multiple of 11.  To compute the alternating sum, you just alternate adding and subtracting the digits.  For example, let's look at the number 641234.  The alternating sum of the digits of this number is 6 - 4 + 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0.  So 641234 is a multiple of 11; sure enough, 11*58294 = 641234.  This rule offers some nice symmetries like the rule for 9's; for example, you can swap any two even numbered digits or any odd numbered digits (like the first and the third or the 2nd and the 6th) or insert two zeros anywhere in the number without changing the alternating sum.    13: There are two tricks for 13: one similar to the trick for 7 and another similar to the trick for 11.    First trick: Take the last digit, multiply it by 9, and subtract from the remaining number.  The result is a multiple of 13 if and only if the original number was.  Example: 595166.  Let n1 = 595166 and form n2 = 59516 - 9*6 = 59516 - 54 = 59462.  Then write n3 = 5946 - 9*2 = 5946 - 18 = 5928.  Next, n4 = 592 - 9*8 = 592 - 72 = 520.  Finally, n5 = 52 - 9*0 = 52, and 52 = 4*13.  So 595166 is a multiple of 13.    Second trick: separate the digits into groups of three digits (the way you normally would insert commas).  Then take the alternating sum of these groups of three digits.  The original number is a multiple of 13 if and only if the result is.  Take, for example, 11146715892.  The groups of three for this example are (working from right to left): 892, 715, 146, 011.  Now do the alternating sum: 892 - 715 + 146 - 11 = 312.  We have 312 = 13*24, so 11146715892 is a multiple of 13.    When your daughter gets a little older and learns some algebra, she'll be able to start thinking about why these rules work and how they generalize to other numbers (in fact, both of the above two strategies can be made to work for any prime number, and then a simple fix can allow you to get divisibility rules for any power of a prime number).  Before you know it, you'll have a mathematician on your hands!    EDIT:  I thought of an amusing math game that might get her thinking.  Write down the numbers 1 through 9 at the top of a piece of paper.  The set aside a column for you and a column for her.  The idea of the game is for each of you to take turns picking numbers; once somebody picks a number, that number is crossed off and nobody can pick it again.  The object of the game is to be the first player who has picked three numbers which add up to 15.  So, for example, if you have chosen the numbers 4, 1, 9, 2 then you win because 4 + 9 + 2 = 15.  The game itself is kind of fun, but it becomes truly interesting when you know the right strategy.  Write down the following 3x3 grid of numbers:    4 9 2  3 5 7  8 1 6    Notice that every row, column, and diagonal adds up to 15, and moreover ALL ways to get three numbers from 1 through 9 to add up to 15 are represented on this grid.  So if you secretly put an "X" through the numbers that you choose and circle the numbers she chooses, then you will quickly realize that you are really playing tic-tac-toe in disguise!  This is a very basic example of a phenomenon that is absolutely fundamental in modern mathematics: two objects that appear on the surface to be very different can actually have the exact same underlying structure.|`|VLT2VgP9aa	Google "duplation and mediation" for a cool multiplication trick.

This trick can be used recursively; just keep adding the digits of the 'new' number until you get a number that you recognize as divisible by three (or not).     For example: consider 123456789123456789...  The sum of the digits is 90, therefore the original number is divisible by three because 90 is divisible by three.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Check the link|`|VwPXhaZLaa	To multiply a two digit number by 11, you add the two numbers together, and place that in the middle.

BvKfMIAVaa	The Easy way: look at the degree of the polynomials. the highest degree of the numerator is 2, and it is 3 for the denominator.  the limit as x goes to infinity is 0    rules for rational equations and limits as x -> infinity:    1. if the degree of the numerator is less then the degree of the denominator, the limit as x approaches infinity is 0    2. if the degrees are the same, divide the leading coefficient of the num. by the leading coeff. of the denom. and that will be the limit as x approaches infinity.    3. if the numerator's degree is higher than the denominator's, the limit as x goes to infinity is infinity|`|lG1wVvWIaa	There are a few rules that you should memorize for limits as rational polynomials go to infinity.    There are three basic rules for evaluating limits at infinity for a rational function f(x) = p(x)/q(x):  If the degree of p is greater than the degree of q, then the limit is positive or negative infinity depending on the signs of the leading coefficients;  If the degree of p and q are equal, the limit is the leading coefficient of p divided by the leading coefficient of q;  If the degree of p is less than the degree of q, the limit is 0.  If the limit at infinity exists, it represents a horizontal asymptote at y = L. Polynomials do not have horizontal asymptotes; they may occur with rational functions.    I'm going to add one more... it doesn't apply in your case, but it may apply to some of your homework.    If the degree of p is greater than q by EXACTLY 1 then a slant asymptote may exist.  The equation of which is found by dividing p by q.  The equation of the slant asymptote is given by y = q(x), where q is the quotient of the division.      In this particular case, the degree of p is less than that of q so the limit is zero, or there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0|`|sZeBrVLVaa	The general trick for this type of limit (one polynomial above another) is to divide top and bottom by the highest degree of x.    So in this example, divide top and bottom by x^3 to get:    (2-3x+4x^2)/(x^3+7) = (2/(x^3) - 3/(x^2) + 4/x)/(1 + 7/(x^3))    All terms in the top tend to 0, the bottom tends to 1, so the whole thing tends to 0/1 = 0.|`|aHF3eYynaa	Given :    lim    (1/x) = 0  x -->     How that helps...    First multiply f(x) by (1/x^3)/(1/x^3).    Resulting in (4/x - 3/x^2 + 2/x^3) / (1 + 7/x^3)    Now you can take the limit by plugging in .    (4/ - 3/ + 2/) / (1 + 7/)    Using what we know this is equal to    (0 - 0 + 0) / (1 + 0) = 0/1 = 0    The trick for limits to  like this one is to multiply the top and bottom by the reciprocal of highest power in the denominator. In this case the highest power was x^3.|`|b96e23f4e62d95301c15a6f530a29fe7aa	Or, just divide every term in the numerator and denominator by x^3 and inspect each term as x-> +infinity. In the numerator each term goes to zero; in the denominator the first term goes to one and the second to zero. So the limit is 0/1 or 0.|`|9be68eae160088984012d05ff1d09253aa	hey mate,    the method provided by cidyah is certainly valid, however I found limits involving this type of expression can be attacked in a simpler manner    here you have    lim( x --> inf ) (2-3x+4x^2)/(x^3+7)  In this case the higher order is 3 (x^3), so divide top and bottom by x^3  i.e.  lim( x --> inf ) (1/x^3)(2-3x+4x^2)/((1/x^3)(x^3+7))  = lim( x --> inf ) (2/x^3-3/x^2+4/x^3)/(1+7/x^3)   = ( 0 + 0 + 0)/( 1 + 0) = 0/1 = 0    As stated before, the previous method posted is 100% valid, however when it involves polynomials it is sometimes 'easier' to divide the top and bottom by x to the power of the higher order.    Hope this helps,    David|`|jRJBs4hxaa	You can tell by inspection that the limit is 0, since the exponent of the denominator is higher than that of the numerator.    L'Hopital's Rule:  Differentiate the numerator and the denominator.  lim x-> inf  (-3+8x) / (3x^2)  lim x->inf  8 / 6x  as x goes to infinity, 8 / 6x goes to 0.|`|338b3316dd9a4033996db0f8eb3925bdaa	Take the first derivative of the top, and divide it by the first derivative of the bottom.

AA10969890	-3/2 = - 1 1/2 so  d|`|8R2aDPXOaa	-9 x 1/6 = -- 9/6 = -- 3/2 = -- 1 1/2 D is the answer.|`|P5G6G20laa	Don't worry! There's no algebra in this question. It's simple once you pull the numbers apart, a bit.    -9 x 1/6 = -1.5 (d. -1 1/2)    If you discard the negative sign for a second, (so the -9 becomes a positive 9), you can always add it in later.  That turns it into the simpler sum:    9 x 1/6    To find a sixth of a number, you can just divide it by six. So:    9 times 1/6 = 9 divided by 6 = 1.5    Now that you have the answer, you must remember to add in the minus sign we took away earlier, making the answer -1.5, or -1 1/2.    Hope this helped! :)|`|9bkzEBQSaa	When you are multipying fractions, you don't have to worry about common denominators, factors, or anything of that nature.     The only operation you must take into consideration is Top x Top / Bottom x Bottom.     -9 x 1/6 is your problem.     It is evident -9 isn't a fraction yet, but remember that anything divided by 1 is itself, so rewrite -9 as -9/1. So your equation now reads:    -9/1 x 1/6. Top x Top / Bottom x Bottom yields  -9 x 1 / 1 x 6, which reads the fraction -9 / 6.     You are almost finished, you just need to simplify this. Each has a common divisor of 3, so the fraction reduces to   -3 / 2, which is the same thing as -1 1/2, option D. (Recall that -2 / 2 = -1, so that fraction is -1 with 1/2 over).
i7OFOo7faa	The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar natural numbers and integers ("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in arithmetic. The deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory, whence such popular results as Fermat's Last Theorem. Number theory also holds two widely considered unsolved problems: the twin prime conjecture and Goldbach's conjecture.    As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers ("fractions"). These, in turn, are contained within the real numbers, which are used to represent continuous quantities. Real numbers are generalized to complex numbers. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quarternions and octonions. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers, which formalize the concept of counting to infinity. Another area of study is size, which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity: the aleph numbers, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.|`|TqtzzsHjaa	2m^2 - 10m^2 + 8m    = -8m^2 + 8m    = 8m(1 - m)    ---------    x^2 - x - 2    = (x + 1)(x - 2)|`|dUZOrLIiaa	for the last one it is (x-2)(x+1)|`|xMfkVm39aa	first one:  simplify by subtracting giving you  -8m^2+8m=0  factor out an m  m(-8m+8) =0  simplify  m=0 and m=1  both of these give you an answer f 0, because when factoring you want the solutions that result in 0    second one:  find what two numbers multiplied together give you 2...1,2, then figure out what combination gives you -1    (x-2)(x+1)=0  so x=2, x=-1

I recommend Solid Works as a good program to do this, but you also need to know the basic principles of stress analysis. Also, there are specific designs for viewing ports that you have to use - you cannot just design your own.    It sounds like you have some bookwork to do before designing your first submarine. Perhaps you could go on a stress analysis course somewhere?    You cannot just say that so much thickness will withstand so much pressure, it depends on the shape. Also it is not the strength that limits you, it is the elastic instability. In other words, most submersibles will fail by buckling rather than by exceeding the ultimate tensile strength.

NwbgvzfXaa	Because we have a load (weed trimmer) with resistance and wire with resistance, they both will have voltage drops across them. Therefore, the voltage applied to the load (weed trimmer) will be equal to the source voltage (120 volts) minus the wire resistance voltage drop (unknown).    We are given the value of the weed trimmer resistance. But we need to calculate the wire resistance.  Resistance of wire = R * L / A {from first source link I posted below}  L = total length of wire  in meters  A = cross-sectional area of wire = 1.47 * 10^(-6) meters2   R = resistivity of copper = 1.68 * 10^(-8) ?-meter {from second source link I posted below}    Resistance of wire = (1.68 * 10^(-8)) * (87.2) / (1.47 * 10^(-6))  Resistance of wire = 99.66 * 10^(-2)  Resistance of wire = 0.9966 ?  Resistance of wire = 1 ? (rounded)    We now have a simple series circuit with a source voltage, the wire resistance, and the weed trimmer resistance. So there will be a voltage drop across the wire resistance and a voltage drop across the weed trimmer resistance.   Since the weed trimmer resistance (12.1 ?) is much greater than the wire resistance (1 ?), the voltage drop across the weed trimmer will be proportionally much larger than the voltage drop across the wire resistance.    To calculate the voltage applied to the weed trimmer, you have a simple voltage divider network where the voltage drop across the weed trimmer is proportional to the ratio of its resistance divided by the total resistance of the circuit. {see third source link I posted below}  = source voltage * trimmer resistance / total resistance  = 120 * (12.1 / (12.1 + 1)  = 120 * (12.1 / 13.1)  = 110.84 volts    Therefore, with a 120 volt source, there will be 110.84 volts dropped across the weed trimmer and 9.16 volts (= 120 - 110.84) dropped across the wire resistance.|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Extension Cord Resistance = 12.1 ohms  2 x 12.1 = 24.2 ohms    120VAC will be applied to the electric weed trimmer.

So, your math and concept is correct, but you can't do it that way in real life.  To answer the next question, 200 ug/4L is 0.2mg/4L = 0.05mg/L.

That is, simplify each side until you get the same thing on both sides.  Do not bring terms from one side to the other or multiply both sides by the same number.  1.)change cscx to 1/sinx,  and 1-(cosx)^2 to (sinx)^2, they are both identities.  The left side will simplify to 1 by reducing fractions.  2.) A rule of thumb is to put all functions in terms of sin and cos using identities.  secx=1/cosx,  tanx=sinx/cosx.  Substitute and get 1/cosx-cosx=(sinx/cosx)sinx.  Since the left side has two terms and the right side one,  put a 1 under the second term, cosx, and add the fractions.  The common denominator is cosx.  So the left side becomes (1-(cosx)^2)/ cosx, and the right side((sinx)^2)/cosx.  Substitute on the left side(sinx)^2 for 1-(cosx)^2, and you get the same thing that you have on the right side, so you are finished.|`|UhNdzd2oaa	1.)

Hx39uEz6aa	Smoking causes many problems for the lungs. Normally your respiratory tract is lined by loads of little cilia (epithelial cell projections - "finger like"). These cilia are also surrounded by a layer of mucous which helps to trap microscopic particles that we breath in. Normally the cilia would "waft" the mucous up the trachea, and into the throat where it can be expelled from the body, or move into the esophagus so it can be destroyed by the stomach acid. This is known as the muco-ciliary escalator. Smoking damages this. Without the cilia and mucous to trap harmful particles, they wind up in the lung where they can move no further. This accounts for the carbon deposits. A lung from a person who smoked for many years will often half a slightly striped appearance -  this is due to the fact that maximum expansion of the lungs occurs between the ribs where there is less obstruction, so the carbon often deposits into these areas.  The persistent cough is usually to do with the fact the mucous accumulates, but is unable to move anywhere due to the absence of cilia, so coughing occurs in attempt to clear it. A patient of this age, and having smoked for so long, will probably have a condition called COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).  Hope this helps|`|jjt2enntaa	If you keep abusing the natural mechanism, eventually it breaks.|`|8f00317a29c2d78d6114f32ce1019318aa	Epa! in the same way that every function of the body declines with age.

axKQq9nXaa	Acutally as much as I love myth busters I was extremely upset at that episode... why? It was a very poor test and it gave false facts. Elephants are not scared of mice.    On that test they used a white mouse, something that does not live in the wild around elephants. The elephants did not avoid it because it was a mouse, they avoided the mouse because it was not something they were used to seeing and took caution. Elephants might be large but they are extremely smart and know to avoid something that they have never seen before until they know what it is. Not to mention the color of the mouse stood out far more than a normal rodent making it easier for the elephant to see.    Heck I have seen our elephants given new toys that are extremely large and they are very cautious around it until they know or understand what it is. It is no different with any animal really, be it a lion with a mouth full of fangs and paws full of claws or even a tiny mouse... when they happen across something new they are careful around it.    In the wild and in captivity mice happen across elephants all the time and no one is scared. They are not scared for two reasons, for one, the elephants have established that they mice are nothing to fear... or two, the elephants never even see them due to size difference. Look at it this way, do you notice every single bug that happens across your path?

eZ3ir3Cmaa	The Institution of Mechanical Engineers is the fastest growing professional engineering institution in the UK. Our 80,000 members work at the heart of the countrys most important and dynamic industries.     With a 160-year heritage supporting us, todays Institution is a forward-looking, campaigning organisation. By working with leading companies, universities and think tanks, we create and share knowledge to provide government, businesses and the public with fresh thinking and authoritative guidance on all aspects of mechanical engineering.     We truly believe we can improve the world through engineering. So the Institution finds and nurtures new talent, helping engineers build their careers and take on the challenges that, when solved, will make a difference to all of us.     In the UK, engineering has achieved great successes, but in a quiet way.   Were looking to shout about the achievements of our members and the industry, taking a positive, inspiring message into schools and out into the media.  By being independent of both government and business, and avoiding strategic relationships with single-issue bodies or pressure groups, we can deliver genuinely impartial advice in a passionately committed manner.     As an Institution, we focus on four principal themes which affect and are affected by our engineers:     Energy   We promote sustainable energy use and engineering sustainable supply.  We need to share knowledge, change the way we behave and drive advances in technology to reduce the strain on the worlds resources. We champion the development of more sustainable sources of energy will also help reduce emissions.     Environment   We promote economic growth while mitigating and adapting to climate change and the depletion of natural resources.  We need to minimise waste, pollution and our impact on the world around us. We must also adapt the way we do things to cope with the climate changes that are already underway.     Transport   We promote safe, efficient transport systems to ensure less congestion and emissions.  To advance, travel must be made cleaner, safer and easier. That means creating a better understanding of global transport supply and demand, while keeping a sharp focus on the implications on carbon emissions.     Education   We inspire, prepare and support tomorrows engineers so we can respond to societys challenges. Engineers will come up with the solutions that will make a brighter future for everyone. Thats why its so important that the industry not only prospers, but grows. Were committed to inspiring the next generation of engineers who can rise to the challenge.     Its no secret that theres a real shortage of engineers. We go to great lengths to promote the profession at grass roots level, engaging with the next generation of mechanical engineers to build a brighter future for us all.  Initiatives we own or are involved in to achieve this include: Formula Student , Greenpower , Science and Engineering Ambassadors ,   Engineering Your Future  events, and Engeneration .  Every year, we give Prizes and Awards   worth in excess of 400,000 to help nurture the UKs engineering talent. The Institutions Prizes and Awards Fund offers amounts ranging from 250 to 10,000.  We celebrate the successes of the most inspirational students through the Vision Awards  which take place in October.     Events and Training   The Institution is committed to providing the best possible service for its members, ensuring that they have the skills, knowledge, support and development advice they need at every stage of their career.  Throughout the year, we organise a comprehensive series of events  (technical conferences, seminars, workshops and social functions) which are designed by engineers for engineers.  Our dedicated programmes of professional development training  enables our members to navigate successfully through their initial professional registration, and then helps engineers to retain their competencies and keep their skills up to date through structured learning throughout their working lives.     Recognising Manufacturing Excellence   Mechanical engineering is at the heart of the UK manufacturing industry  the sixth largest in the world. With its MX Awards, the Institution recognises and rewards manufacturing success in a wide range of categories, raising the profile, and ultimately the standards of British industry.  Every entrant receives a customised benchmark report rating their performance against best practice and highlighting areas for improvement. The MX Awards showcase some of our finest talent, putting engineering to work in one of the worlds most competitive industries.     Our members and supporters make us who we are. Together we can improve the world through engineering.|`|OBJufnfUaa	Absolutely.  There are endless jobs in the UK for mechanical Engineers.

If you think about it, as the speeds they are travelling at are 10 mph apart, each hour they will grow ten miles apart, (e.g. after two hours car one will have travelled 74 miles, while car two will have travelled 94; 37x2= 74, 47x2=94. They are twenty miles apart, ten miles for each hour.)  This means that after 40 hours they will be four hundred miles apart, following the same rule of ten miles every hour: 40x10=400 miles apart.

It will take 40 hours at 10 mph to go 400 miles.|`|AA10266675	What is important here is that one car is travelling 10 mph faster than the other car.  That is to say, the distance between cars increases 10 miles for each hour.  given the time in hours t, the distance in miles = 10*t.  The question wants 10*t = 400, so solve for t.    multiply both sides by 1/10, to give t = 40.    Thus it will be 40 hours before the cars are 400 miles apart.|`|VwPXhaZLaa	One is moving away from the other at a speed of 10mph (the difference between their two speeds)    Speed = distance/time, so:  Time = distance/speed    400 miles / 10mph = 40 hours    The 37mph car will have traveled 1480 miles, the 47mph one will have traveled 1880 miles.|`|VlsvYCzuaa	It is the difference in speed that results in the distance apart!    delta v = 47 -37 = 10 mph = 10 mile / hour    distance = time x velocity => 400 (mile) = time (hours) x 10 (mile/hour)    time = 400 / 10 = 40 hours

BfmV2KpUaa	How to make your own clone.    You will need ;  - Human Tissue: Pure human cells of one tissue type, from the individual who will be cloned.  - Human Tissue Culture Media: Media in which these human cells will grow and divide.  - Minimal Human Tissue Culture Media: Media in which cells will stop dividing, and enter a state of "quiescence" without dying.  - Laboratory supplies: Incubator, Sterile Hood, petri dishes, microscopes, and tools capable of removing and implanting cellular organelles, such as the nucleus, from one cell to another.  - Unfertilized human egg cells.  - Human Egg Cell growth media: Media where fertilized eggs will grow and divide.     Procedure;  1. Grow the human cells to be cloned until you have a good supply.  2. Transfer the cells to minimal media. [For now, The Sheep Cloning Paper is a good reference for exactly how long.] This should allow the cells to live, but they should stop dividing and enter quiescence. This is likely the step in which the cells lose their differentiation, and revert to a more totipotent state.  3. When the cultured cells are in the quiescent state, get an unfertilized human egg cell. Remove the nucleus from this egg cell. Try to minimize damage done to this cell and discard the nucleus.  4. Take one of the quiescent cells in it's entirely, and implant it inside the coat around the egg (known as the zona pellucida) next to the egg itself.  5. Electroshock the egg. [For now, The Sheep Cloning Paper is probably a good reference for how much and how long to electroshock.] The electroshock induces the fusion of the two cells, so you should be able to tell when you've electroshocked enough just by looking at the cells. The rebooting of the human genetic program is believed to be initiated by the replacement of donor cell protien signals by egg cell protien signals, but the electroshock might assist in moving those protien signals across the nuclear membrane as well. Electroporation is a common technique for moving DNA molecules through a cellular membrane.  6. Repeat the last three steps as necessary until you have enough clones. Expect a lot of them not to survive because of cellular damage and other mishaps. Allow the embryos to grow and divide a few times in Human Egg Cell growth media.  7.

b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	Yes, designer babies have belly buttons.  A designer baby is just a baby who has some special genetic traits that the parents wanted, and after the egg and sperm are matched up and the egg is fertilized, the zygote (that's what a fertilized egg is called when it just starts out) is implanted into a woman's uterus to carry the baby until it's born.    Once it's implanted, the zygote grows normally.|`|ry3Yw86Jaa	To my knowledge, all human babies, 'designer' or otherwise are gestated within a human mother and would therefore have an umbilical cord and belly button.  I would think it would be very difficult to culture a baby outside the womb, so many hormonal changes and pathways are involved- especially between the mother and baby.  You'd have to simulate that by providing exactly the right levels of hormone at the right time.  Honestly, I don't think we even know all the hormonal pathways involved right now.   Complicated, development is :p|`|I6NwduJPaa	No, it does not mean that they are not bron from a woman, it means that whilst the actual fertilization of the egg with the sperm happened outside the body, the zygote / fetus is them implanted into the woman, and so it is born via normal birth.|`|UoAZzwacaa	In-vitro babies are only fertilized in a test tube. They are then implanted in the mother's uterus, or in a surrogate mother. The babies then grow like any normal baby, with a placenta, amniotic sac, and umbilical cord. Since they come to term in a woman's uterus and have an umbilical cord they do have belly buttons.|`|as09Oxz3aa	Yes they do!    They are still grown in a female's womb, thus they have an umbilical cord which is why we all have belly buttons!    Designer baby just means that the parents have chosen what they want their baby to look like etc, and by changing its genes, thats what they can get.

Also, animals may be accidentally carried in shipping containers etc...  Pigs are a great example of accidental release.  They're a big problem, world wide- from the Southern US to the Galapagos Islands to Australia. Sometimes the introduction is intentional- Billy doesn't want his pet squirrel anymore but he thinks it would do well in the Outback.  Or now that the class project with Xenopus (clawed frogs) is over, Miss Keane dumps them out in the nearest pond.  Pythons are a great example of intentional release.  There's a breeding population of unwanted pets on the Florida Keys right now.  If they're not eradicated, the Key Deer is toast- extinct, dead and gone forever.       But you're forgetting invasive plants though.  In the US at least, plants are even more of a problem than animals.  And it goes both ways, Eucalyptus is a big problem in the southern US, for example.  Garlic Mustard, Stilt Grass, Kudzu, Salt Cedar, Reed Canary Grass, Ice Plant to name a few!  And many of these introductions are from the lawn and garden trade- some are even sold even though they're known to be invasive- like Purple Loostrife, which was only recently outlawed for sale in the US.  Other popular garden invasives are Honeysuckle, Burning Bush, Autumn Olive and Barberry.  These plants alone are responsible for millions of acres of lost habitat.  And yet they're still sold and planted!  Even more ludicrous is that there are native alternatives- there's a native honey suckle that's even prettier than the invasive.  Red Osier Dogwood is red all year round and it's native.  And there are native Autumn Olives and Barverries.  Why people don't just sell them, I haven't a clue.    Some cases of invasive introduction are just plain bizarre.  Did you know starlings were introduced to the US in the 1890's by a man who wanted New York's Central Park to have all the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.  Wild.  Why can't people leave well enough alone?

If the current is just going around an empty circuit (nothing but resistors, etc, but no motors) than all the of power is being dissipated by heat. Therefore all you need is the Power equation:   P=IV or P = I^2R.    If there is a motor or some sort of mechanical word being done then it gets a bit more complicated and without more information I can't really help you out.

CO2 that is used in your paintball gun is a gas that can be liquified at room temperatures and put into containers.    Nitrogen can not be liquified and put into containers at room temperature unless you get a cyrogenic thermos container. Nitrogen usually is stored as a compressed gas, so those little paintball containers wouldn't hold much energy compared to liquid CO2 which expands into a gas just fine when you take the pressure off it|`|2Ypig4jBaa	Welders use nitrogen to keep the metal they are working on from oxidizing.  Since it is one of the main components to the air we breath releasing a little more into the atmosphere would not be noticeable.  Interesting thought to reducing your CO2 emissions.|`|5H4SAVlIaa	The difference between a gas and a vapor is a vapor can be liquefied by pressure alone a gas needs some cooling and pressure (like liquid air)   The co2 in your paint gun is a liquid with some vapor.  when you shoot it the vapor is your propellant and the vapor is replaced by more from the liquid that evaporates due to a pressure drop and is ready for another shot.  The co2 cartridge is not full of liquid or it would explode if the temp when up.  Google  "pressure/temperature relation" to understand thyis.

Es cierto que no estamos tratando bien a nuestro planeta, pero todo este boom de la sociedad se debe a unos cuantos catastrofistas.   Ni mucho menos podremos cargarnos el mundo, antes acaba l con nosotros.  Durante eones La Tierra ha seguido una evolucin y parte de ella es el cambio del clima, no asociado a hechos antrpicos.  Es cierto que hemos acabado con bosques, especies de animales y para mi lo ms preocupante de todo es que estamos acabando con el agua potable del planeta. Pero ni de cerca vamos a acabar con el mundo.  La Tierra de por s siempre ha sufrido efectos invernaderos, extincin de especies de animales y de plantas (si no de qu es es carbn y el petrleo), y adems en anteriores pocas han existido mucho mayor nmero de terremotos, erupciones volcnicas, etc... y todo eso antes de que apareciese el hombre.  Se?ores es cierto que estamos perjudicando al planeta, pero no para acabar con l, simplemente estamos viciando nuestro hbitat. El ser humano solo es una especie ms que ha de pasar por el planeta.

FiDcOMgxaa	Cereals because it floats on the milk just like the ribosome floats on the cytoplasm <br>  <br>  Also,we can you compare a ribosome to in a grocery store;the most obvious answer is to draw an analogy between a ribosome and a shopper. The ribosome reads mRNA just as the shopper reads a grocery list. Each unit of mRNA is a three-letter code that tells the ribosome which amino acid it needs to add to make a complete protein, much in the same way that each item in a grocery list tells the shopper which items to pull from the shelves and add to their shopping cart. <br>  <br>  Also, we can compare a ribosomes to a classroom;that a ribosomes are like students because they both produce materials needed according to the directions given to them.

Science can never explain "why" God created the universe the way it is - or why the universe doesn't have different laws. God explains that - the "why" it is the way it is.    So, we (and the universe) act according to the laws of physics created by God.

aa6bf8ad894aaee5b986433fe69301d8aa	El punto de partida es la irritacin de la mucosa nasal. De hecho, el estornudo es un mecanismo de defensa del aparato respiratorio.    La irritacin estimula la sensibilidad de la nariz y ello provoca una fuerte inhalacin de aire -aproximadamente dos litros y medio- que pasa a los pulmones. Es entonces cuando los msculos abdominales hacen subir al diafragma para aumentar la presin en los pulmones.    Mientras tanto, los msculos de la faringe se cierran tambin. El aire sale entonces disparado por la nariz, y tambin por la boca, a una velocidad promedio de entre 110 y 160 kilmetros por hora.    Es casi imposible para una persona mantener sus ojos abiertos mientras estornuda. El reflejo de cerrar los ojos parece no tener objetivo alguno: los nervios que controlan los ojos y la nariz se encuentran relacionados y un estmulo en uno de ellos a menudo produce una respuesta en el otro. Tambin es casi imposible estornudar sin mover la cabeza, slo si el estornudo es muy suave. Esto es debido a que el movimiento de la cabeza hacia adelante ayuda a expulsar las sustancias irritantes del aparato respiratorio|`|891f4cf4fd343c6af8ac50a5e46d1af3aa	Al muy importante de querer evitar el estornudo es que algunos organos de la cabeza sufren una sangoloteada a gran velocidad lo cual no es nada recomendable.|`|9f9f6535e7342db44830256f2b18baa3aa	porke no mejor te dedicas a hacer cosas de provecho para tu comunidad en vez de andando queriendo saber estupideces como esta pregunta, la neta.|`|5e9becc485c528d25d43c553c9b5e5f5aa	Ni idea!! pero supongo que dependera tambien del estado de la persona, la edad bla bla bla y ciertos factores que determinan a que velocidad sale el 02 y el dioxido de carbono; ya que no sera lo mismo en un ancianoo que en un ni?o.|`|dcbb9df0c54de80d21c391655924b4edaa	aprox. 15 km/h|`|b3106309c8d41673451b69dd723515ecaa	230 km/seg|`|AA12016687	hijo de su mecha si q esa respuesta esta dificil de desifrar ya q es super rapidisimo un destornudo.......me rindo un saludo desde houston texas|`|9dedf6219e0990398c91327014d46487aa	Que te crees!?

w2nfvZ0caa	Make sure you post this in the "Physics" section next time, rather than the "Mathematics" section (many more people will know the answer).    I  A2    In this relationship, "I" is "intensity", and "A" is "amplitude". It says that the intensity of a wave is proportional to the wave amplitude squared. So, to increase the intensity of a wave by a factor of "49.0", solve the proportion for "A":    I = A2  49.0 = A2  49.0 = A  7.0 = A    The amplitude of the wave must be increased by a factor of "7.0".    I hope this helped (this explanation and all) since I'm not too great at physics.

Uk7boYCraa	Un ni?o ndigo es aqul que muestra una nueva y poco usual serie de atributos psicolgicos con un patrn de comportamiento no documentado an. Este patrn tiene factores comunes y nicos que sugieren a quienes interactan con los ni?os (los padres en particular) que deben cambiar la forma de tratarlos y de criarlos para poder lograr un equilibrio adecuado. Ignorar estos nuevos patrones de comportamiento es crear desequilibrio y gran frustracin potenciales en la mente de estas preciosas nuevas vidas.     Hay varias clases de Ni?os ndigo, pero en la siguiente lista estn dados algunos de los patrones de comportamiento ms comunes:      Ellos vienen a este mundo con un sentimiento de realeza (y frecuentemente se comportan de ese modo).      Ellos tienen la sensacin de "merecer estar aqu" y se sorprenden cuando otros no comparten eso.      La autoestima no es para los ni?os ndigo un gran tema de preocupacin. Con frecuencia les dicen a sus padres "quines son ellos".      Ellos tienen dificultad en aceptar una autoridad absoluta sin ninguna explicacin y sin alternativa.      Ellos simplemente no harn ciertas cosas; por ejemplo: esperar en una fila es muy difcil para ellos.       Se frustran con sistemas rituales que no requieren pensamiento creativo.      Con frecuencia ellos encuentran mejores formas de hacer las cosas, tanto en casa como en la escuela, lo que los hace parecer rebeldes, inconformes con cualquier sistema.      Parecen antisociales a menos que se encuentren entre ni?os de su misma clase. Si no hay otros con un nivel de consciencia similar, a menudo se tornan introvertidos, sintiendo que ningn ser humano los entiende. La escuela a menudo es muy difcil para ellos desde el punto de vista social.      Ellos no son tmidos a la hora de expresarle a usted lo que necesitan. No respondern a la disciplina de "culpa" ("espera que tu padre llegue a casa y se entere de lo que has hecho").

Volume of cylinder  is pi*r^2*h    therefore  2/3*pi*1000 = pi * 169 * h  2/3 * 1000 = 169 * h  666.6667 = 169 * h  3.94 = h|`|zYriuUiWaa	hemisphere volume = 2/3pi r^3    2/3*3.14159*1000=2094.4    cylinder volume = 2r*pi*h    2*13*3.14159*h=2094.4    isolate the height    81.7*h=2094.4    devide bothe sides by 81.7    h=25.6
fTnAgUU0aa	According to the way you asked it, nothing. One would assume that there is another chemical in the flask that you are trying to get a state change with as well as a color changing indicator. <br>  <br>  (1) So if your solution is with the NaOH, then it is basic to begin with and you gradually move the system towards a lower pH which is indicated by the color change. <br>  <br>  (2) If you had the HCl in the flask with the chemical, then you would start with the second color and approach a higher pH with the addition of NaOH until the same midpoint is obtained, which is signified by a color change in the reverse order of the first described solution.|`|RtrqOqosaa	none.. the HCL is an acid and the NAOH is a base... so if you switch them around, you will still be making a neutral solution.. but otherwise, you'll be taking an acid out of the biurette, and putting in a base...<br>  vote as best answer!<br>  thanks ! ;)
GF1NPlBSaa	It is because the affected countries have competing claims to the land in dispute, and have not been able to resolve the line of demarcation to satisfaction.  It may or may not have anything to do with the actual ethnicity of the people living in the area; in fact, sometimes there are no people living in the area at all because it's so inaccessible, which is why the borders are so hard to set. Until the countries can come to an agreement on where to set the border, it remains "undefined".      Sometimes the disagreement is based on geography/climate, such as where to draw the line in the desert between Saudi Arabia and Yemen (i.e. does anybody really care which side of the desert they're on?) and in that respect, the dispute is either amicable or low-priority.  Canada and the United States have had several amicable border disputes, as have the US and Mexico.  As late as the 1960's, Mexico and the US swapped some land that had been under dispute for many decades.    Other border disputes are contentious but not militarily involved, such as the Hala'ib Triangle dispute between Sudan and Egypt.  Though both countries assert a vigorous claim to the area, there are no troops present to provoke a war.    Still other border disputes are very tense and occasionally involve military action, such as India/China and India/Pakistan.  Those disputes are over very hotly contested land (contested either for their political or economic value) and neither side is willing to cede anything to the other.  Those are the most dangerous, especially when one or more of the affected countries possess nuclear weapons...|`|Dh9gKlsjaa	I think the land between China and India might be the Kashmir mountains that were given to China by Pakistan
euaIzZr4aa	Q1.    Times to go each way are t1  &  t2  d = 6t1     and    d=10t2.  But t1+t2 = 48 min  =  48/60 hour  Therefore  d/10 +d/6 = 48/60  or 16d = 48.  d = 3, each way.   Distance gone = 6km    Q2    x= no of dozen in first crate.  Then 1.5x +2 (x+3) = total purchase price.  Selling price = 5(2x+3)/2    [the 5/2 =$2.50]  So 5(2x+3)/2 = 1.5x +2(x+3) + 15  This comes to:   5x+15/2 = 7x/2 + 21  or x = 9.  Answer:  9 dozen in first crate, 12 dozen in 2nd crate      Q3    Equation is   9/4 +x/2 = 6  So x = 15/2  or  7.5 km per hr      Q4    Let  boy's age =b,  father's age =d    Equations are:   b = d - 24   and    b+2 +d+2 = 40.    Solving these gives    b = 6,   d = 30  Present ages are  6   and  30.

Scientists make models to explain the universe.  The model is good insofar as it succeeds in predicting what we will observe.  But it is never proven.    That said, the simplest tests of quantum mechanics are from spectroscopy.  Elements that are heated radiate with particular frequencies.  Bohr's original model of the atom (the solar system-looking thing) successfully explained Hydrogen.  The Schrodinger/Heisenberg theory explains pretty much all non-relativistic phenomena, so they can calculate the basic structre of all the spectra (allthough you have to add a priori terms to explain fine structure).  The most up-to-date version of quantum electrodynamics explains all atomic spectral phenomena as far as I know.|`|xXOnjDNOaa	In general the way a scientific theory gains support is that it makes a prediction that differentiates it from a competing theory.  A test is then performed, and the results analyzed to see if the prediction was correct.  Rinse, repeat.  In a strict sense, nothing is ever "completely proven" because there is always some statistical uncertainty, all you can do is test to a certain confidence level. To that extent quantum theory thus far has been one of the most experimentally successful theories ever devised (I believe at this point the limits of testing it lie more in our ability to measure than in its ability to predict).|`|m2pNTLloaa	The rigor of a science is proportional to its ability to predict.    Light has a dual nature. Some things observed about light is best described by Wave Mechanics  other things are best described by Quantum Mechanics.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%...    One phenomena that Quantum Mechanics does very well and waves does poorly is the photoelectric effect.  It can be shown that light arrives at the photoelectric cell in discrete packets of energy.

z7BiMSWmaa	The heterogeneity in DNA comes from the varying sequences of the bases which form the genetic code. Needed to code for the vast number of genetic traits.    A point of informaton - Watson and Crick did not do any  actual practical work. The X-ray studies on DNA were done by Rosalind Franklin in the lab of Maurice Wilkins at King's College London. Sadly Rosalind died and Watson, Crick and Wilkins got the Nobel Prize.|`|3ZPYB7nxaa	I suppose this question revolves around the term "heterogeneous". It means something is composed of many parts with the implication they are arranged in a random fashion. DNA and proteins are macro molecules called polymers. The individual parts of a polymer are structures called monomers. In proteins, the monomers are amino acids. DNA monomers are peptides. Both DNA and proteins are heterogeneous because of the structure of proteins. The DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins, so the fact the proteins are heterogeneous means they are derived from equally heterogeneous DNA.    FYI: Watson and Crick were an American/British team working out the structure of DNA using a technique called X-ray crystallography. A beam of X rays creates a diffraction pattern which can be used to build a three dimensional structure of the arrangement of atoms inside a crystal. The team had several clues to the structure, but the data eventually became unusable. Another researcher was an expert in this field, but she was antisocial and arrogant. She had done a number of X ray studies and Watson and crick stole her notes, enabling them to finally solve the structure of DNA. They went on to become famous for their discovery, but sadly "Terrible Rosy" was never given credit.

vSkqJ813aa	Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Experimentalists had found that '... [sic] when a metallic surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation above a certain threshold frequency (typically visible light), the light is absorbed and electrons are emitted. In 1902, Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard observed that the energy of individual emitted electrons increased with the frequency, or color, of the light. This was at odds with James Clerk Maxwell's wave theory of light, which predicted that the electron energy would be proportional to the intensity of the radiation. ...(Wikipedia)'       Einstein's theory, published in 1905, accounted for the emission of electrons from a surface, when it is illuminated by light, by describing light a a 'photon' or quantised packet of energy. The energy of the photon was described as being directly proportional to the frequency of the light. With the constant of proportionality, within the energy 'E' / frequency 'f' relationship, being Planck's constant 'h'. Thus, a photon of light has a 'quantised' energy given by the expression: -    E = hf      Hence, if 'light' may be found in the decreasing wavelength range of: infra-red, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and ultra-violet, then because of the relationship between frequency 'f' and wavelenght '' and the speed of light 'c' (from the wave model of light): -    c =  x f     for decreasing electromagnetic (or light) wavelength the frequency is increasing. Thus, as the frequency of the light increases so too must its energy (from Einstein's equation (above)). Hence, ultra-violet  light has more energy than infra-red radiation because it has a shorter wavelength and, thus, a much higher frequency.|`|M7B3kCSMaa	ultraviolet light waves have a higher frequency than infrared waves.    energy of a photon of light (yes light is both a particle and a wave....) is calculated using the equation E=hf where h is planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light wave.|`|6MvemD9Baa	because ultraviolet waves are before infrared rays in the electromagnetic spectrum|`|wQbUacv8aa	Since the frequency of ultra violet is higher, there is more radiation per minute, if you will, in an ultra violet wave hitting an object, than there is in an infrared wave hitting one. Imagine a slinky. An infra red wave in like a stretched out slinky, while an ultraviolet wave is less stretched out, and so the "waves" are closer together.

f4ik0ScQaa	I just bought one myself!  Marvellous things they are.  SLM's are a brilliant tool for beam shaping and manipulating without the time sharing constraints of something like an Opto-Acoustic Modulator.    The SLM will need to be placed in the fourier plane of your laser focus, then when the upload a phase mask to the device, the fourier transform of the phase mask will be the beam pattern at focus.  You can make any shape you want.  If the SLM is hooked into a second display output from a PC then you can update the phase mask at 60Hz and thus, animated beam patterns!    I've included a link to the University of Glasgow's (not my university) optical trapping group page, where they have a few videos demonstrating SLM's.

91f71f9b3a6226e03f335ef42a3c00b9aa	Los sismos, terremotos o temblores son perturbaciones repentinas en el interior del planeta, que originan movimientos del suelo o vibraciones.    La principal causa de los sismos es la ruptura de rocas en las capas exteriores de la tierra, como resultado de un proceso de acumulacin de energa de origen geolgico que deforma la superficie y da lugar a las grandes cadenas monta?osas.     En el interior del planeta ocurren estas rupturas repentinas, cuando la energa acumulada es mayor que la resistencia de las rocas. Al ocurrir esta fractura, se propagan una serie de ondas ssmicas, que al llegar a la superficie, sentimos como temblores o terremotos.      Por lo general estos sismos ocurren en zonas dbiles de la corteza terrestre llamadas fallas. Al sitio donde se inicia la ruptura se le denomina foco y su proyeccin en la superficie epicentro.     Un promedio de ochocientos mil temblores azotan la tierra cada a?o, pero muchos son peque?os y no son sentidos por el ser humano.     Un temblor severo de magnitud mayor, puede ser esperado cada ocho o diez a?os. Pero un nmero significativo temblores ms peque?os, capaces de gran destruccin, ocurren cada a?o.      Las zonas ssmicas se muestran con muy marcada distribucin. La vasta mayora est localizado dentro de estrechas zonas que corresponden a los lmites de las placas continentales.     Estas placas son bloques de corteza terrestre que continuamente estn en movimiento relativo unas con otras.     Existen varias maneras de medir la intensidad del temblor o terremoto. Actualmente se utilizan mayormente la escala de Mercalli que va de 1 a 12 grados, dependiendo del nivel de destruccin del fenmeno, siendo que un temblor de dos grados es prcticamente imperceptible y doce grados, significa destruccin total.    De lo anterior se desprende que esta escala mide nicamente los efectos que el temblor tuvo sobre el humano y las edificaciones en un lugar determinado, pero no cuantificar el lmite de la energa que fue liberada.     Por su lado en 1935 el cientfico Charles Richter introdujo el concepto "magnitud" para catalogar los sismos, tomando la amplitud mxima de las ondas superficiales. A esta se le llama "Escala de Magnitud Richter".|`|AA10664023	Los sismos se deben al movimiento de las capas tectnicas de la Tierra.

Esta energa se transmite a la superficie en forma de ondas ssmicas que se propagan en todas las direcciones. El punto en que se origina el terremoto se llama foco o hipocentro; este punto se puede situar a un mximo de unos 700 km hacia el interior terrestre. El epicentro es el punto de la superficie terrestre ms prximo al foco del terremoto.     La noticia en la calle  Ondas ssmicas  Terremotos y ondas de choque                          La noticia en la calle   Peridico mural japons, del a?o 1855, en el que se transmite la noticia de un terremoto.   Enciclopedia Encarta   Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo                 Tama?o completo                                      Terremotos y ondas de choque   Los terremotos se producen cuando se libera de forma sbita la presin o tensin almacenada entre secciones de roca de la corteza, causando temblores sobre la superficie terrestre. El lugar en el que las capas de roca se desplazan y disponen unas en relacin a otras se llama foco, centro efectivo del terremoto. Justo encima del foco, un segundo lugar llamado epicentro se?ala el punto superficial donde la sacudida es ms intensa. Las ondas de choque se propagan como ondulaciones desde el foco hasta el epicentro decreciendo en intensidad. Los tipos principales de ondas ssmicas son las ondas primarias (ondas P) y las de cizalla (ondas S). Las ondas P desplazan las partculas en la misma direccin que la onda (izquierda). Son las detectadas primero porque son ms rpidas que las S (derecha), que provocan vibraciones perpendiculares a la direccin de propagacin.   Enciclopedia Encarta   ? Microsoft Corporation. Reservados todos los derechos.                 Tama?o completo                Las vibraciones pueden oscilar desde las que apenas son apreciables hasta las que alcanzan carcter catastrfico. En el proceso se generan 4 tipos de ondas de choque. Dos se clasifican como ondas internas viajan por el interior de la Tierra y las otras dos son ondas superficiales. Las ondas se diferencian adems por las formas de movimiento que imprimen a la roca. Las ondas internas se subdividen en primarias y secundarias: las ondas primarias o de compresin (ondas P) hacen oscilar a las partculas desde atrs hacia adelante en la misma direccin en la que se propagan, mientras que las ondas secundarias o de cizalla (ondas S) producen vibraciones perpendiculares a su propagacin. Las ondas P siempre viajan a velocidades mayores que las de las ondas S; as, cuando se produce un sismo, son las primeras que llegan y que se registran en las estaciones de investigacin geofsica distribuidas por el mundo.|`|c45fd4ecec09df0f51d7548686394101aa	El petroleo nada tiene que ver son los sismos, estos son la consecuencia del movimiento de las placastectonicas que forman el planeta, estas estan en constante movimiento y al chocar unas con otras producen movimientos teluricos.

Los peces ya se reproducan por huevos. Y los anfibios. Y los reptiles, que mucho ms tarde, darian lugar a las aves. Y por ltimo, la gallina, que tambin pone huevos.    Las respuestas anteriores que dicen "la gallina" se equivocan, porque utlizan el antiguo sistema de intentar explicar la realidad mediante la religin. Y claro, surge el conflicto del creacionismo, que no tiene ningna base cientfica, slo religiosa.     Y la religin est basada en antiguos textos y creencias. No se saba muchas cosas.

AA10683186	Average: add up all the numbers and divide by the number of numbers. example: 2-5-8-10-14; add them up equals 39. Divide 39 by 5 and answer is 7.8.    Median: is the middle number or the average of the two middle numbers if there is no exact middle number. Example: 1-3-8-10-19; the middle number is the third number which is "8" which is the median. In this case the median has exactly two numbers on each side of it. Now if there is no middle number, such as 1-3-8-9-10-19 then average the two middle numbers, which would be an average of 8 and 9 which is 8.5. Remember to order all the numbers from low to high before you start computing the median. so if u have 10-1-23-18-0-5 you should order the numbers first as 0-1-5-10-18-23; in this case the median is 7.5    By the way the "mode" is the most frequent number in a set. In the above examples there is no mode. however if u had something like 3-6-6-6-8-9-14-14-21 the mode would be '6' because that is in the set three times and no other number has that great an occurrence.    I hope this helps.|`|6edf2f4da56de961f83e173cb0a96b55aa	If you add all the prices together and divide by the number of prices, that is the average price- Example $1.00, $5.00, $249.00  The average would be the total ($255.00) divided by 3 which = $85.00  The median is just the middle number in the lineup, so in this case the the median is $5.00.  The median and the average are both measures of the middle trend of a group of numbers. You can see that when you have an extreme outlying number in the group as you do here (249), the average can get really skewed. That's why often the median is a better indicator of the middle than the average is.

Rlm7VjeEaa	ok i haven't had biology for a long time but here we go!    1... To ensure neatness of preparation for microscopic examination, be sure that the microscope is clear of any debris and is set on the correct settings. Then be sure that you have all your material laid out in an orderly fashion and away from the edges of the table.    2... Some advantages of mounting material on a slide is that it will hold the leave still. If you don't have it on a slide, it could fall down into the light or it could easily be moved by wind or fidgety hands. Another advantage would it would spread it to a thin and broader level which, in turn, will show you an accurate and more expansive region. If it wasn't then you might see a bunch of things that would make more sense if they weren't piled onto each other. Finally, it will make it easier to zoom in on the subject because it will be thin and protected by glass.

So, sin x - cos x = 2 sin(x - 45)    Solving: ? 2 sin(x - 45) = 1 ???? for -45  x - 45  315  ???? sin(x - 45) = 1 / 2    The related angle  (acute) satisfies sin  = 1 / 2 and so  = 45    So, x - 45 =  or 180 -     So, x = 90 or 180    ------------------------------    The approach of squaring the equation has two problems.  First, it can add solutions, and so you must check whether this could have happened (eg. x + 1 = 2 has one solution, but (x + 1)2 = 4 has two solutions).  In this case, squaring *does* add solutions...    cos x - sin x = -1 ???? for 0  x  360    (cos x - sin x)2 = (-1)2    cos2x - 2 cos x sin x + sin2x = 1    -2 sin x cos x = 0, using sin2x + cos2x = 1    sin x cos x = 0    So, sin x = 0 or cos x = 0 on 0  x  360    x = 0 or 90 or 180 or 270 or 360    Of these, only x = 90 and 180 are solutions of the original equation... the others (0, 270, and 360) are all solutions of cos x - sin x = 1    Rewriting the equation to cos x = sin x - 1 before squaring leads to a solution of x = 0 or 90 or 180 or 360, again containing two invalid solutions.    The second problem with squaring is that it may not lead to an equation that is easily solved (eg. squaring 2 sin  = 3 - cos  makes a mess), whereas the auxilliary angle method used above is general.    2 sin  = 3 - cos     (2 sin )2 = (3 - cos )2    2 sin2 = 3 - 23 cos  + cos2    2(1 - cos2) = 3 - 23 cos  + cos2    0 = 1 - 23 cos  + 3cos2    Let u = cos : ? 3u2 - 2u3 + 1 = 0  ...not a nice quadratic    By contrast...    2 sin  = 3 - cos     2 sin  + cos  = 3    Let 2 sin  + cos  = R sin( + ) for R > 0  2 sin  + cos  = R sin  cos  + R cos  sin     Equating coefficients of sin  and cos :    2 = R cos  ..........

R = 3 as R > 0.    So, 2 sin  + cos  = 3 sin( + ) = 3  ???? sin( + ) = 1  ????  +  =  / 2  ????  =  / 2 - tan1(1 / 2)    ... and I doubt you will find *that* solution in exact form from 3u2 - 2u3 + 1 = 0 where u = cos .|`|AA11602341	Ask yourself, when would cos(x) = 0 and sin(x) = 1?    cos(/2) - sin(/2) = 0 - 1 = -1  x = /2|`|bQ36mdBdaa	cosx = sinx - 1 .../square  cos^2x = sin^2x - 2sinx + 1  1 - sin^2x = sin^2x - 2sinx + 1  2sin^2x - 2sinx = 0  sin^2x - sinx = 0 = sinx(sinx - 1)    x1=180, x2=90
7SUwlwp6aa	Hi, The OR gate is a term mainly used within the electronics industry.  It is one of many types of "Logic Gates" and the output of the logic gate is determined by its inputs.    The standard 2-input OR gate has two input lines and one output line.  There are also multiple input OR's (like 3 inputs or 4 inputs) as with most of the other logic gate types.    Basically, if either OR both of the inputs are a 1 (High), the resulting output value is a 1 (High).  The only time the output is 0 (Low) is when both inputs are 0 (Low).  See the Truth Table below.    2-input OR Gate Truth Table:  --------------------------------------...    A            B           Output:    0             0           = 0   (Low)  0             1           = 1   (High)  1             0           = 1   (High)  1             1           = 1   (High)    Note:  A= Input A, B = Input B    Other logic gates:  AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, NAND, NOT...    Hope this helps.|`|AA11602341	Or gates are logic gates that turn and output on when the one or both of the inputs are on.

You get 2x+2.    2. -4x + 10 = -2x - 30  Simplifying  -4x + 10 = -2x + -30    Reorder the terms:  10 + -4x = -2x + -30    Reorder the terms:  10 + -4x = -30 + -2x    Solving  10 + -4x = -30 + -2x    Move all terms containing x to the left, all other terms to the right.    Add '2x' to each side of the equation.  10 + -4x + 2x = -30 + -2x + 2x    Combine like terms: -4x + 2x = -2x  10 + -2x = -30 + -2x + 2x    Combine like terms: -2x + 2x = 0  10 + -2x = -30 + 0  10 + -2x = -30    Add '-10' to each side of the equation.  10 + -10 + -2x = -30 + -10    Combine like terms: 10 + -10 = 0  0 + -2x = -30 + -10  -2x = -30 + -10    Combine like terms: -30 + -10 = -40  -2x = -40    Divide each side by '-2'.  x = 20    Simplifying  x = 20    There, hope you get it now!

8oCwrIR2aa	It's square root is: x/2 - 1 + 2/x.    I made it harder for myself than it is 'cause I dropped the "- x" before the "+ 3"! Bummer.    First, I hate these. But it's made more palatable if you get rid of the fractions. For divisors you have 4, x^2, and x so if you multiply by something covering those as factors AND that is a perfect square, then find the result's square root, you can divide by the square root of what you multiplied by  that's why you want to multiply by a perfect square, not just something that "works."    So, 4x^2 suggests itself. And it's a perfect square: we'll divide the result by 2x. Great. 8x^2 would also work, but you'd have to divide by (22)x which is not something we want to do.    4x^2 times the original is:    (4x^2) * (x^2)/4 + (4x^2) * (4/x^2) - (4x^2) * (4/x) - (4x^2) * x + (4x^2) * 3  (4x^4)/4 + (16x^2)/(x^2) - (16x^2)/x - 4x^3 + 12x^2  x^4 + 16 - 16x - 4x^3 + 12x^2    And since we are doing all that to make it look clearer and be easier to work with, rewrite in standard fashion, highest power (order) term first:    x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x + 16    Alright, the part I'm least fond of. By "long division method" I assume you really mean the method of finding square roots that looks a bit like long division, but isn't, not exactly.    To start, consider the first term. it will be the product of the first term of the square root, no matter what other terms there are. So you have to use its square root as the first term in the answer. Cool. So your answer has x^2 so far. You square that and subtract it from the source:    x^4 - 4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x + 16 - x^4 = -4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x + 16    Here's the tricky part: the next division is twice that factor, plus some more. As in "2x^2 + b"  but just what is "b"? -4x^3 is the first term. Try (-4x^3)/(2x^2). That's b = -2x. So you will multiply (2x^2 - 2x) by -2x and subtract the result from the current remainder:    (2x^2 - 2x) * (-2x) = -4x^3 + 4x^2    -4x^3 + 12x^2 - 16x + 16 - (-4x^3) - 4x^2  (-4x^3 + 4x^3) + (12x^2 - 4x^2) - 16x + 16  0 + 8x^2 - 16x + 16  8x^2 - 16x + 16    So now you have a new remainder and your square root is currently "x^2 - 2x". You double the current result, and add "b" again, then find the best idea for "b" So, 2x^2 - 4x + b. (8x^2)/(2x^2) = 4, so let's start with 4. (I say start with, because it may turn out there's something better. But this technique is always the best starting point because it will rid you of the highest order term each time.)    So: (2x^2 - 4x + 4) * 4 = 8x^2 - 16x + 16    Subtracting that from the current remainder:    8x^2 - 16x + 16 - (8x^2 - 16x + 16)  (8x^2 - 8x^2) + (-16x - [-16x]) + (16 - 16)  0 + (-16x + 16x) + 0  -16x + 16x  0    Perfect! So the square root of the modified polynomial is: x^2 - 2x + 4. But remember that we multiplied the original by 4x^2 to get that. That means the square root of the 4x^2, which is 2x, is still "in" that answer. To remove it, we must divide the answer obtained by 2x:    (x^2 - 2x + 4) / 2x  (x^2)/2x - 2x/2x + 4/2x  x/2 - 1 - 2/x    So the answer is: x/2 - 1 - 2/x.

In this case we have :-  Number = 2  Base = 2  Let log of number be y  and let log be log to base 2    y = log (2)  2^y = 2  y = 1    Thus log 2 = 1 (for base 2)|`|gxwF60jMaa	log? 2 = 1|`|p43YceDoaa	y=log(2)2  2^y=2  y=1  therefore log(2)2=1

pXra2klxaa	My friend, the answer to your problem is in your hand and in yourself. All you can get from us are good advices that would motivate you to study hard.    Why I said that it is in your hand and you yourself can solve that? Well first change your attitude towards study. Have focus and don't get bored easily. Try to discipline yourself and avoid any distractions while studying. Have somebody to be an example to you, like those  people who are from poor background but became successful due to education. Please bear in mind that  "Education Is A Key To Success". Have full determination to finish your studies despite some hindrances that might come along the way. The hard units you are taking this semester is one the example of hindrances or stumbling blocks in your way of success towards study, just try to overcome it by studying hard. Good luck....|`|BA3y6MBlaa	All students go through that..I'd clean my entire house avoiding homework.

Be bored with thinking about working a McDonalds.  That's boring.  Cheer up, it's a small little time in the scheme of things that you have to focus and LEARN.  '|`|yGPRntXFaa	turn off your cell phone, turn off your TV, go to the library do the work there or at tutoring in school.....join a study or tutoring group...... do your work man... it will lead you to a better future... ask a school counselor to help you with advice on good study habits... eat before you study....  and keep personal problems away from school and you will do well.. for starters, don't write the way you would in a text on a cell phone... learn the right way..    Search on google... GOOD STUDY HABITS.    Sleep well, drink lots of water, not soda before you study... you need to lower your anxiety before school work.. now the best advice is this...    DONT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT TO START STUDYING... START A PROJECT THE FIRST DAY ITS ISSUED>..    . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day...

9be68eae160088984012d05ff1d09253aa	hey mate,    firstly x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16    Thus,  int( 1/sqrt( 8x + x^2) dx ) = int( 1/sqrt( (x+4)^2 -16) dx)  Let t = x + 4 --> dt/dx = 1 --> dt = dx  Thus,  int(1/sqrt( (x+4)^2 - 16) dx) = int( 1/sqrt( t^2 - 16)  dt )  let t = 4sec(w) --> dt/dw = 4sec(w)tan(w) --> dt = 4sec(w)tan(w)dw  Thus  int(1/sqrt(t^2 - 16) dt) = int( 1/sqrt( 16sec^2(w) - 16 ) 4sec(w)tan(w)dw)  = 4int(1/sqrt(16(sec^2(w) - 1)) sec(w)tan(w)dw )  = int(1/sqrt(sec^2(w) - 1) sec(w)tan(w) dw )  Trig Identity sec^2(w) - 1 = tan^2(w)  Thus,  = int( 1/ (tan(w)) sec(w)tan(w) dw)  = int(sec(w)dw)  This can be a really tricky integral, however it becomes really easy if you multiply top and bottom by sec(w) + tan(w), i.e.  int(sec(w)dw)) = int( sec(w)(sec(w) + tan(w))/(sec(w) + tan(w)) dw)  = int( (sec^2(w) + sec(w)tan(w))/(sec(w) + tan(w)) dw )  Let u = sec(w) + tan(w) --> du/dw = sec(w)tan(w) + sec^2(w)  --> dw = du/ (sec(w)tan(w) + sec^2(w))  Thus,   int( (sec^2(w) + sec(w)tan(w))/(sec(w) + tan(w)) dw ) =  int( (sec^2(w) + sec(w)tan(w))/u du/ (sec(w)tan(w) + sec^2(w))  =int(1/u du) = ln(u) + C ; C = integration constant  = ln(sec(w) + tan(w)) + C\  Recall t = 4sec(w) --> sec(w) = t/4  as tan(w) = sqrt( sec^2(w) - 1) = sqrt( t^2/16 - 1) = (1/4)sqrt(t^2 - 16)  Thus,  = ln( t/4 + (1/4)sqrt(t^2 - 16) ) + C  Recall t = x + 4  Thus,  = ln( (x+4)/4 + (1/4)sqrt((x+4)^2 - 16)) + C    Hope this helps,    David

Ive considered this for my entire house, i just love the way it looks, but im not sure if its bad for the building or not(i.e. cracks from root invasion). As for them giving off oxygen, its just natural for a plants to suck up CO2 and release air, but remember that they only do this through photosynthesis and only when exposed to light. I think that plants reform to an enviroment(your apt.) to suit their own needs, so i think that they could filter some allergens out of the air that you breath. One thing that i have heard is that if you talk to your plants they grow faster, could be the direct breathing on the plant.....hmmm...makes ya think huh?

wPbJgcUIaa	Egg shell and tooth enamel are made of nearly the same stuff, Calcium Carbonate.  Just like sea shells too.  But the big difference between sea shells and the other two is the thickness.  For teeth and eggs, the calcium carbonate is very thin and has many pours in the surface.  In the case of the eggs, these pours helps oxygen to get into the egg to allow the baby chick to breath before it hatches and in the case of teeth, it allows the body to "renew" the enamel.  However, the calcium carbonate can be damaged or destroyed by weak acid such as HCL

Give me a while and I'll post all the answers. :)<br>  <br>  How many integers are there in the solution set of |x-5| ≤ 3?<br>  a. 11, b. 0, c. an infinite number, d. 9, e. 7<br>  <br>  x - 5 ≥ -3 and x - 5 ≤ 3.<br>  x ≥ 2 and x ≤ 8.  So we have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  So the answer is E.<br>  <br>  If y varies jointly as the cube of x, w, and the square of z, what is the effect on w when x, y, and z are doubled?<br>  a. w is doubled, b. w is multiplied by 8, c. w is divided by 8, d. w is divided by 16, e. w is multiplied by 64<br>  <br>  y = x^3*w*z^2.<br>  2y = (8x^3)*w*(4z^2).<br>  y = 16x^3*w*z^2.  But this should look like the original equation, y = x^3*w*z^2.  So you'd have to divide w by 16 to get it to look that way.  Answer: D.<br>  <br>  The units digit of 9573^91 is:<br>  a. 1, b. 3, c. 7, d. 9, e. none of the above<br>  <br>  Notice a pattern (look at the one's digit): 3^1 = 3.  3^2 = 9.  3^3 = 27.  3^4 = 81.  3^5 = 243.  3^6 = 729.  2^7 = 2187.  2^8 = 6561.  They keep ending in 3, 9, 7, 1, 3, 9, 7, 1, and so on, and so on.  Every fourth power it repeats.  4*22 = 88.  So 3^88 ends in a 1.  Which means that 3^91 ends in a 7.<br>  <br>  In a plane, the homogeneous coordinates of a point P, whose rectangular coordinates are (x, y), are any three numbers a, b, and c for which a/c=x and b/c=y. If the coordinates of P are (6, 5) and a, b, and c are integers, then the sum of a, b, and c could be:<br>  a. 2, b. 5, c. 8, d. 11, e. 12<br>  <br>  If x = 6 and y = 5, and a/c = 6 and b/c = 5, let c = 1.<br>  Then a = 6 and b = 5.  And a + b + c = 6 + 5 + 1 = 12.  Answer E.<br>  <br>  The number of terms in the expansion of (2x^2 - 3y^3)^8 is:<br>  a. 6, b. 8, c. 1, d. 7, e. 9<br>  <br>  The expression (ax + by)^n always has (n + 1) terms.  So, the answer here is E.<br>  <br>  <br>  Each term of a sequence, after the first, is inversely proportional to the term preceding it. If the first two terms are 3 and 6, what is the twelfth term?<br>  a. 3, b. 6, c. 2?3^11, d. 46, e. the twelfth term cannot be determined<br>  <br>  This is saying that 6 is inversely proportional to 3.  6 = 3k.  So k = 2.  So you're multiplying by 2 every time (geometric sequence).  The 12th term would be 3*(2^11).  (Check  your paper, I think you might have made a mistake by typing 2*(3^11).)<br>  <br>  In the equation x^2+kx+18=0, one root is twice the other root. The value(s) of k is(are):<br>  a. +5.0, -5.0, b. 15.0, c. -5.0, d. +9.0, -9.0, e. 22.0<br>  <br>  You could solve this analytically, but it's monstrous.  Or you could just plug them into your grapher and see which one gives you two roots, one twice as big as the other.  As it turns out, 9 gives x = -3 and x = -6 and -9 gives x = 3 and x = 6.  So the answer is D.<br>  <br>  Under which condition is (x+y)/(x-y) negative?<br>  a. 0<x<y, b. x<y<0, c. y<0<x, d. y<x<0, e. y^2>x^2<br>  <br>  Try the condition for A: Say x = 3 and y = 4.  Then we have (3 + 4)/(3 - 4) = -7, which is negative (duh).  So the answer is A.<br>  <br>  If 6 and -1 are both zeros of the polynomial P(x), then a factor of P(x) is:<br>  a. x^2-6, b. x^2-5x+6, c. x^2+5x-6, d. x^2+6, e. x^2-5x-6<br>  <br>  If 6 is a zero, (x - 6) is a factor.  If -1 is a zero, (x + 1) is a factor.  If both are factors, so is (x - 6)(x + 1) = x^2 - 5x - 6.  Answer choice E.<br>  <br>  i^114 + i^115 + i^116 + i^117 =<br>  a. 1, b. 2i, c. 1-i, d. 0, e. 2+2i<br>  <br>  Remember that i^1 = 1, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1.  So, i^1 + i^2 + i^3 + i^4 = i - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0.  Similarly, this sums to zero, too.  Answer: D.<br>  <br>  When (1-x)^6 is expanded, the sum of the last three coefficients is:<br>  a. 10, b. 11, c. 16, d. -11, e. the sum cannot be determined<br>  <br>  The expression (x + y)^n will have the coefficients found on the (n + 1)st line of Pascal's Triangle.  The 7th line of Pascal's triangle has the numbers: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.  But since there's a NEGATIVE in the parentheses, the signs change, the first number being positive.  So now it's 1, -6, 15, -20, 15, -6, 1.  The sum of 15, -6, and 1 is 10.  Answer choice A.<br>  <br>  If the roots of the equation x^2+bx+c=0 are r and s, the value of 1/r+1/s in terms of b and c is:<br>  a. b^2/c^2, b. c^2/b, c. b^2/c, d. -b/c, e. -b^2/c<br>  <br>  Notice that (1/r) + (1/s) = (r + s)/(rs).  (r + s) = (-b / 2a) and rs = (c / a).  (-b/2a) / (c / a) = (-b/c).  Answer choice D.<br>  <br>  Which of the following is the equation of the circle that has its center at the origin and is tangent to the line with equation 3x-4y=20?<br>  a. x^2+y^2=2, b. x^2+y^2=4, c. x^2+y^2=3, d. x^2+y^2=5, e. x^2+y^2=16<br>  <br>  Solving for y, you get y = 3x/4 - 5.  Graph this, and you'll see that the only one of the above circles that intersects with it is x^2 + y^2 = 16.  Specifically, they intersect at (2.4, -3.2).<br>  <br>  If L varies inversely as the square of D, what is the effect on D when L is multiplied by 9?<br>  a. it is multiplied by 3/2, b. it is multiplied by 9, c. it is multiplied by 3, d. it is divided by 3, e. none of the above effects occurs<br>  <br>  As an equation, LD^2 = k.  If L ---> 9L, then D ---> D/3 to make up for it (since (9L)(D/3)^2 = LD^2).  Answer choice D.<br>  <br>  The solution set of 3x-4y>0 lies in which quadrants?<br>  a. I only, b. I and II, c. I, II, and III, d. I, III, and IV, e. I, II, III, and IV<br>  <br>  Take a point in Quad. I: (3, 1).  3(3) - 4(1) > 0.  So it's in I.<br>  Take a point in Quad II: (-1, 1).  3(-1) - 4(1) < 0.  So NOT II.<br>  Take a point in Quad III: (-1, -2).  3(-1) - 4(-2) > 0.  So it's in III.<br>  Take a point in Quad IV: (1, -1).  3(1) - 4(-1) > 0.  So it's in IV.<br>  <br>  So the answer is choice D.<br>  <br>  Which of the following cannot be a term in the expansion of (p-q)^18?  a. 18p^17q, b. 153p^16q^2, c. -816p^15q^3, d. 153p^2q^16, e. -816p^2q^15.<br>  <br>  Here, the nth term in the sequence will have coefficient: (-1)^(n + 1)*(18 choose (n - 1)).  The second term, the p^17*q term, would have (-1)^(2 + 1) = -1 as an exponent, making the whole term negative.  Therefore, A could NOT be a term in the expansion.  <br>  <br>  If 3x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1 = (x-i)(3x-1)Q(x) for all values of x, then Q(x) =<br>  a. x-2, b. x+2, c. x-2i, d. x+2i, e. x+i<br>  <br>  (x - i)(3x - 1) = 3x^2 - x - 3xi + i.  Multiply this by each one of the answers until you get 3x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1.  It turns out that (3x^2 - x - 3xi + i)(x + i) = 3x^3 - x^2 + 3x - 1.  So the answer is choice E.  <br>  <br>  <br>  A point in space has coordinates (5, -3, 12). How far is the point from the y-axis?   a. 8.5, b. 7, c. 8.1, d. 13, e. 7.6<br>  <br>  As you're moving 5 units along the x-axis, you're moving AWAY from the y-axis.  As you're moving -3 along y, you're not moving away or toward the y-axis.  As you travel along the z-axis, you travel away from the y-axis.  So the answer is sqrt(5^2 + 12^2) = 13 units.  Answer choice D.<br>  <br>  If p(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial, p(1)=-2, and p(-1)=-3, what is the value of the remainder when p(x) is divided by x-1?   a. -2, b. 2, c. -3, d. 3, e. the value cannot be determined<br>  <br>  Can't be determined.  It could be anything.<br>  <br>  Which of the following could be a possible root of 3x^3 - px^2 + qx - 8 = 0?  a. 1/6, b. 4, c. 3/2, d. 2/3, e. 4/3<br>  <br>  The possible rational solutions are all factors of -8 divided by all factors of 3.  So the possible rational solutions are: +/- 8, +/- 4, +/- 2, +/- 1, +/- 8/3, +/- 4/3, +/- 2/3, +/- 1/3.  2/3 and 4/3 are both in the list, so both D and E are correct (or at least I'm pretty sure.)<br>  <br>  The set of points (x,y) that satisfy (x+3)(y-2)>0 lies in quadrant(s)  a. only I and IV, b. only II, c. only III and IV, d. only I, II, and III, e. I, II, III, and IV<br>  <br>  Plug in points just like the problem before.  It's in Quadrant I, II, III, but not in IV. Answer choice D.  <br>  <br>  <br>  If ax^3 + 2bx^2 + 3cx + 4 = 0 when x=-1, what is the value of ax^3 - 2bx^2 +3cx + 4 when x=1?  a. -8, b. -4, c. 0, d. 4, e. 8<br>  <br>  When x = -1, we have: -a + 2b - 3c + 4 = 0.<br>  When x = 1, we have: a - 2b + 3c + 4 = 0.<br>  Look at the left-hand side: everything cancels except 4 + 4 = 8.  Answer choice E.<br>  <br>  If h varies as the square of V and inversely as r, which of the following is true?  a. If r is increased by 2, V is increased by 4<br>  b. If both r and h are doubled, then V is doubled.<br>  c. If r is doubled and h is divided by 4, then V remains unchanged.<br>  d. If r is quadrupled and h is divided by 2, then V remains unchanged.<br>  e. None of the above is true.<br>  <br>  In algebra, h = kV^2/r.  You can tell that if you double r and h, we have 2h = kV^2 / 2r, you have 4hr = kV^2.  4hr = k(2V)^2.  So V is doubled as well.  Answer choice B.  <br>  <br>  The absolute value of the difference between the roots of the equation x^2 + 2x - 5 = 0 is  a. -5, b. √10, c. 2√6, d. 2, e. √20<br>  <br>  From the quadratic equation, we have x = (-2 + sqrt(24))/2 and x = (-2 - sqrt(24))/2.  | (-2 + sqrt(24))/2 - (-2 - sqrt(24))/2 | = | 2sqrt(24) / 2 | = |sqrt(24)| = 2*sqrt(6).  Answer choice C.<br>  <br>  I'm still thinking about the last one...<br>  <br>  Hope these help!|`|SdEtY9GQaa	GOOD WORK JOHN

3ZPYB7nxaa	besides the invention of agriculture itself (about 20,000 years ago), the oldest scientific plant experiment was the discovery of genetics by a monk who grew peas in a monastery. Gregor Mendel grew peas and observed the changes which occurred through several generations. Peas have flowers which pollinate themselves, so if left undisturbed, the plants will all be identical in the next generation. Interesting things began happening when Mendel begin artificially crossing the plants. He noticed the next generation had a number of the traits of both parents, such as seed color and wrinkles. He took years of notes and discovered there was a definite pattern to inheritance. This was centuries before the discovery of DNA, but Mendel already knew there was something responsible for the inheritance of things such as the color of peas or a person's height. <br>  <br>  You can do Mendel's experiments with an ordinary deck of cards. The experiment will be splitting the deck in two (26 cards each) and drawing a card from each half deck. Obviously, if one deck was all black and one deck was all red, then each pair of cards would have 1 red and 1 black card. This represents what happened when mendel made his first artificial cross - he created a hybrid. Therefore, the first rule of genetic inheritance is that if two pure strains cross (one all balck and one all red), the offspring will be 100% hybrid. Now, the next experiment will consist of making each 26 card deck a hybrid. There will be 13 red and 13 black cards in each half deck. Shuffle the decks well, so the black and red do not alternate. Now, start drawing pairs of cards. You will find half the pairs will be pure red or pure black. Half will be hybrids. The actual percentages won't be exact, but very close. What you did this time was cross a pair of hybrids. The final experiment will consist of crossing a pure strain with a hybrid. You will need an extra deck, since 26 cards in one deck will all be 1 color and 13 cards in the other deck will also be this color. The odds this time ought to be 50% pure and 50% hybrid.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
hChJyYEBaa	In your dad's somatic (body) cells, there are 46 chromosomes. All exactly the same in every one of his somatic cells. <br>  In the sperm cell there are 23 chromosomes (that go on to fuse with the 23 chromosomes in your mum's egg which goes on to make you). How ever, every egg and every sperm cell's chromosomes are slightly different to each other. This variation is introduced by the cross-over, which occurs during meiosis (the cell division that occurs in sex cells resulting in half the usual number of chromosomes)<br>  <br>  So, in sex cells, the duplicates and lines up in the middle of the cell, similarly to mitosis. However, before the chromosome separate to different ends of the cell, the partner chromosomes cross-over, causing a swap of genetic material. The cell then divides into two and divides again forming 4 daughter cells all with half the amount of chromosomes.<br>  <br>  Therefore it is true, you do have the same genetic material as the exact sperm and egg that made you (after all, all your somatic cells were formed from mitosis of that first cell!) however, it is slightly different to your dad's somantic cell because of the cross over.

q3SRQN6zaa	It's a way of finding out how many electrons each atom has, and it what orbital they are in.  However, the ones you have listed for Hydrogen and Lithium are wrong.  Hydrogen should just be 1s^1 (it's the first element in the first column) and Lithium should be 1s^2 2s^1 (it's in the second row).<br>  <br>  Basically, you look at the periodic table, and the first two columns are the S block, the 6 columns at the right are the P block (there's D and F blocks too).  So for Boron, it fills the first row of the S block (1s^2) the second row of the S block (2s^2) but only has one of the P block filled so it's only 2p^1.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps, there's a lot more details that go into it, but that is the basics.

z7BiMSWmaa	Early microscopes, like Leeuwenhoek's, were called simple because they only had one lens. Simple scopes work like magnifying glasses that you have seen and/or used. These early microscopes had limitations to the amount of magnification no matter how they were constructed.<br>  <br>  The creation of the compound microscope by the Janssens helped to advance the field of microbiology light years ahead of where it had been only just a few years earlier. The Janssens added a second lens to magnify the image of the primary (or first) lens.
MP6NVJhCaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is: y = mx + b<br>  <br>  First, we have to find the slope of the line that passes through those two points. To find the slopes, take the difference of the y values over the difference in the x values. [(y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2)]<br>  <br>  Doing that: slope = m = [(8 - (-3)) / (-1 - 2)] = -11/3<br>  <br>  Now that we have the slope, use one of those coordinates to find the equation. I'll use (2,-3)<br>  <br>  y = mx + b<br>  -3 = (-11/3)(2) + b<br>  -3 = -22/3 + b<br>  b = 13/3<br>  <br>  Final equation: y = (-11/3)x + 13/3<br>  <br>  The answer is A.<br>  <br>  : )

oVhCsER9aa	If "your book is terrible" and you're having trouble with logarithms, something tells me you're not going to class.<br>  <br>  Logs are very difficult to learn out of a textbook because technically they are complicated and have lots of unique properties.  These properties ("tricks"), once understood, make log problems pretty easy to compute though.  The book probably lists the theorems with their properties, so if you can read a math textbook (it's a skill, trust me--which I assume is where your difficulty is coming from), then you can probably get your way through the problems you've been assigned.  The real thing to thnk about is the relationship between the theorems and the actual problems themselves.  Unfortunately it's been forever since I took precalculus, and I no longer have my textbook, so you're on your own there.<br>  <br>  You are also excluding the log base from your problems.  Most applications after precalculus use log base e, or the natural log, denoted ln(x).<br>  <br>  Your teacher can show you tricks to complete log problems quickly and easily.<br>  <br>  I saw your additional details, and I can sympathize with your situation.  However, the problem still does not make much sense to me (I simply don't understand what #8 is asking and it looks like #18 isn't all there), and the base is still not listed.  In 16 at the very least the log base does not matter, as long as they are the same.<br>  <br>  The answer to 16 is log { [x^(1/4)] / [z^(1/2)] }<br>  <br>  This is log of x to the 1/4 over z to the 1/2.<br>  <br>  The explanation of this comes from the "tricks" about logs that I mentioned before.  if you have a log with a coefficent (like 1/2) you can move the coefficient as an exponent to the number that is within the log function.  If you subtract two logs, then you can divide what is within the two log functions  within a single log function (the first number becomes the numerator, the second the denominator).<br>  <br>  Also note that the log bases must agree for the second rule I mentioned to work.

The research I've read said that a possible explanation was someone with small cuts / sores / ulcers on his hands butchered a chimp with AIDS; he (she) became infected via blood-to-blood transfer, just like the unfortunate people who acquired it via blood transfusuions, early in the epidemic.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  The HIV viruses crossed over from other primates to people several times in Africa.
