20090304091412AA5qBxq	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Please help with this physics problem!?	block L of mass mL = 1.80 kg and block R of mass mR = 0.500 kg are held in place with a compressed spring between them. When the blocks are released, the spring sends them sliding across a frictionless floor. (The spring has negligible mass and falls to the floor after the blocks leave it.)         (a) If the spring gives block L a release speed of 1.40 m/s relative to the floor, how far does block R travel in the next 0.800 s?      (b) If, instead, the spring gives block L a release speed of 1.40 m/s relative to the velocity that the spring gives block R, how far does block R travel in the next 0.800 s?

[2]Why does life not continue to begin by same original origin?  [3] If all life forms began in this way, how come there are so many different ways of reproduction amongst the plant/animal kingdom?

20090304065416AAXGde1	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How do I calculate how a difference in distance will be relevant to a distance in speed?	One of my friends owns a batting cage and we were wondering if anybody can help us out.        The regular distance between the pitchers mound and home plate is 60 feet 6 inches.  At my friends business, the distance between the pitching machine and home plate is only 45 feet.        Because of the difference in distance, a ball being pitched at 75 mph from 60 feet 6 inches away looks a lot different then a ball being pitched at 75 mph from only 45 feet away (because of the difference in length, the ball travels a lot shorter, causing the batter to have to react more quickly).      Is there a way to figure out a formula to see how fast a ball has to go at one distance for it to have the same time of distance at another speed (like a 60 mph baseball traveling 45 feet will look like a ___ mph baseball traveling from 60.5 feet.)?      P.S.  To figure it out I used proportions (ex: If the ball out of the batting cage was going 60 mph I multiplied 60 by 60.5 then divided it by 45) but I'm not a math genius and I don't know if I was doing it right.

20090304081026AAI0Qs1	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Neuroscience: can one feel his ongoing brain activity?	Sometimes I feel as though I can actually sense which portions of my brain are being activated by whatever it is I'm doing.  So for instance listening to music will trigger a feeling in my head different from doing math problems or speaking a foreign language.  I'm aware that the brain itself has no sensory receptors, but is it possible that for instance the nerves and blood vessels of my scalp can pick up on the electrochemical activity of the brain matter beneath?      I'm aware that this is all complicated by the fact that for instance left brain activity corresponds to right-side sensation.  Regardless, I'm tempted to believe I can actually feel my brain's various lobes working.  Conceivable?  Heard of?  Disproved?

20090304084637AAjfmeP	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Biologically speaking, is it theoretically possible to create life if you put the right elements together?	In other words, if you get "tweezers" small enough to pick up individual atoms and arrange them together like a perfectly-designed puzzle, to match up with some "model" figure, could you theoretically make life?      I know, it's a very outlandish question, but if we're all just atoms arranged in a certain way, would the answer to that question (however improbable it would be) be yes? (Use your imagination here!) I decided to ask this in the biology section because y'all know more about life structures than the average person.

I just got a self-winding watch to avoid having to go out and get batteries every now and then.  But I noticed that it's possible to set the hands on the watch but not the second hand.  With digital clocks and watches, I can set the time to the exact second by waiting till the right time and  press the "next minute" function and set the watch with "00" seconds.   That comes in handy when I'm trying to record tv shows or a few other situations.      With my old mechanical watches, sometimes the second hand slows down a little when I set the minute hand backwards (counterclockwise).  I don't know if that works with the newer watches.

20090227063816AAlR83V	Science & Mathematics;Biology	I have a DCPIP and Vitamin C problem?	I made a 200mg/litre standard solution of ascorbic acid (5% phosphoric acid solution as a solvent) on Wednesday and carried one titration that day itself, three on Thursday and one more on Friday, all with that solution. My results were 34.6ml on Wednesday, 25.2 to 25.3ml on Thursday and 19.1ml on Friday.    At this point, I didn't know if the problem was the ascorbic acid in the standard solution "degrading" or if it was the DCPIP (a 0.001M stock solution made by the school's lab technician for a lesson on Monday; I used it at that concentration without diluting it). So, I made a new standard solution and carried out another titration. The result was 40.6ml.       My questions are:   A) Is it a problem with the ascorbic acid solution or DCPIP or both?   B) Is it necessary to standardise the DCPIP everyday before I use it? (As in, can I calculate the Vitamin C concentration in fruit juices without standardising it?)   C) If the standard solution is "degrading", and I use it to standardise the DCPIP solution over several days, will it affect my calculations? (As in, I put in 200mg of ascorbic acid, solution "degrades", there's less ascorbic acid left in the solution but I still think there's 200mg, affects the calculations, etc...)

20090304082922AA4ecjU	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What do Creation scientists today say about some of the main problems with Darwin's theory of evolution?	As the question stats..btw, here are the main points of Darwin's evolution..      Organisms have changed over time, and the ones living today                are different from those that lived in the past. Futhermore,many                 organisms that once lived are now extinct. The world is not                 constant, but changing. The fossil record provided ample evidence                 for this view.             b.All organisms are derived from common ancestors by a process of                 branching. Over time, populations split into different species, which                 are related because they are descended from a common ancestor.                 Thus, if one goes far enough back in time, any pair of organisms                  has a common ancestor. This explained the similarities of                 organisms that were classified together -- they were similar                 because of shared traits inherited from their common ancestor. It                 also explained why similar species tended to occur in the same                 geographic region.            c. Change is gradual and slow, taking place over a long time. This                 was supported by the fossil record, and was consistent with the                 fact that no naturalist had observed the sudden appearance of a                 new species.            d. The mechanism of evolutionary change was natural selection. This                 was the most important and revolutionary part of Darwin's theory,                 and it deserves to be considered in greater detail.

20090304093231AA2EwJK	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Black moving wind need to know what it is?	Ok first of all I don't believe in ghosts because I have never seen one before throughout my life. Lately i have been experiencing some strange things and I have an appointment to go see a doctor next week.    I was out last night standing on a little hut it was raining lightly, the wind was so so not so strong. I was listening to music and trying to clear my thoughts and it was such a good feeling. I opened my eyes and I saw a black shadowy wind float pass like the wind itself from above a 4 storey building. It was moving like it was wind only that it was black. Can anyone tell me what this is?      I didn't take a photo at the time not only because it was night time and that my phone doesn't have a flash but more because I was stunned like a frozen deer seeing the front lights of a car before it gets hit.      I can't figure it out. It was a pretty dark night last night, bad weather as well with the rain. The black wind whatever it was kind of looked like a school of fish you know moving through the current in the water. It was moving through the wind and it was a thick black smoke only except smoke you can smell it and smoke doesn't travel freely through wind it appears more greyish and bulgy and floats upwards. This thing was like the wind itself kind of like strands of black hair moving pass me and it dived like the 'school of fish' down and then kind of went wavy like the wind itself. God who knows what the hell it was.       Has anyone see this type of thing? Can anyone please tell me what it is.       Thank you.

Well, I've had a ghoslty experience-when my old cat died in his sleep, I found him in his basket. After we buried him, in the evening mum and i wwere in the kitchen (the cat flap was on the kitchen door) we felt him come in, and come up to us, and then went out again. We reckon he came to say goodbye.   My bf's cats see a ghostly thing in his house, suddenly all the cats (6) will watch a blank space, and follow it. And his own cat sat at the end of his bed the other night, and watched the wall, then watched the space above the bed head, then back to the wall, and so on.   He was all alert and mesmerized.   Do you believe cats see the paranormal?      p.s. i will probably get told theres no such thing as ghosts, but hey.

In gardening circles, it is well accepted that south and west exposures are best for sun-loving plants.      The North-South distinction makes sense because the sun travels around the equator, therefore in the Northern hemisphere, the sun is always a little to the South of us, casting a Northward shadow from all objects. This is why North walls are great for shade gardens. However, afternoon sun and Westward exposures are considered to be harsher than morning sun or Eastward exposure - why is this?

My conclusion is that earth was moving in a straight line with constant velocity. When it passes near sun, sun's gravitational force attracted it towards it, say F, but because of earth's existing motion, it only get deflected slightly towards sun.   Now sun's force acted on earth was perpendicular to its motion, so it cannot change it's speed but it can change it's direction i.e. towards it.   Because of earth's existing motion in straight line it try to go away from sun.   Sun gravitational force tries to move it inwards.      Please tell me wherever I'm wrong or you have any explanations.         My question is how does this system happens to be so stable that it is existing for millions of years?   And if motion of any planet is stopped, will it be pulled by sun inside it?

20090304121546AAmiMnY	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Reaction Orders For FeCl3 and KI?	Using a calorimeter, the following data were acquired for the reaction between iron(III) chloride and potassium iodide.       Trial FeCl3(mL) KI(mL) H2O(mL) Inital Rate FeCl3(M) KI(M)   1-20-20-0-5.11*10^-4-.01-.01   2-20-10-10-4.85*10^-4-.01-.005   3-10-20-10-6.89*10^-4-.005-.01   4-15-10-10-6.14*10^-4-.0075-.005   5-10-15-15-6.06*10^-4-.005-.0075      (please ignore the fact that the columns don't line up (stupid formatting!) Numbers are separated by '-')      where M is the molarity. I'm trying to find the orders for the reactants, but the data does not make sense. With less FeCl3 and KI held constant, why did the rate increase (trial 3)? Is it possible that calorimeter wasn't calibrated correctly?      I'm fairly sure that KI is first order and FeCl3 is zero order (seeing that the slopes for trials 4 and 5 are very close). Please confirm.
