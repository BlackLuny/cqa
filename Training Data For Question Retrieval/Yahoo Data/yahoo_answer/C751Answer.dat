FcZU29W6aa	I would just increase the hamburger to 2 pounds.  However, I think you could just leave out the beans and not even increase the hamburger and it would still come out okay.  I would not use guacamole because it may not hold up during the cooking process.    This looks like a wonderful recipe and I am going to try it.  I plan on leaving out the beans and increasing the hamburger.|`|BJugETlOaa	This one is very similar and it has no beans so just leave out the beans or make this one instead.|`|AA12377116	Since the beans are mixed up with the sauce and the meat I'm pretty sure the beans are intended to be a binding ingredient, which means that without them you may not be able to layer your ingredients. But, cooking is all about making what pleases you, go for it.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I would use something like nacho cheese or a can of cheddar cheese soup.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	here is a thought.  If you like beans in general but not the refried stuff, why not use whole beans.  there are some great flavored chili beans on the market.  I would add them whole and skip the refried ones.  The other thing is, skip the beans altogether and make sure the meat is well seasoned as refied beans do have seasoning in them.    Just reread your question and I guess you do not like beans at all sooo, how about if there is rice in the casserole, more rice to make up for the loss of the beans.|`|sG5FKmAYaa	I would try chickpeas for a change.|`|LLQw0xkVaa	use more meat mixture or use whole canned pintos they have a different texture. maybe spanish rice  I don't think I'd put the guacamole in the casserole as it will get cooked and then turn dark   the only concern you have is that the beans act as a glue of sorts for the casserole the structure will be different it may not hold together as well. but if you don't like beans then leave em out.
2zHq2XIMaa	No, there really isn't anyway of telling - even if you ask them you aren't 100% sure that they are telling you the truth and even if they are - maybe they only think it is the truth. I find it safe enough to stick with salads or steamed veggies when I go to un-accomadating restaurants.    But, I do know that some places cook their fries in peanut or veg oil.    I think the best thing to do is to ring up the restaurant before hand and tell them you have special dietary requirments and even ask if you could talk to the chef and ask him to prepare you a special dish as you are visiting there with your family soon.    If he/she is a good chef - she/he will happily take on the challenge - this is a chance for him/her to show his creativity and innovation!|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	visit a vegetarian restuarant. that way you'll have no need to ask  http://www.happycow.net|`|AjE9Dy4Laa	idk anything like that, but peta2 does have an "accidentally vegan" list of foods that are for sure vegan, and there's like an eating out guide.

DFXS4SB4aa	Actually, they aren't the same thing at all, and they aren't interchangeable either.     Coconut milk is not the juice found inside a coconut, but the diluted cream pressed out from the thick, white flesh of a well-matured coconut. Coconut milk is a rich, creamy liquid made from water and coconut pulp.     Cream of coconut  - Cream of coconut is a smooth, thick liquid made from fresh coconuts. It is thick and very sweet, and commonly used in mixed drinks.     http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/Cocon...|`|8bh0IGwJaa	Usually 'Cream of Coconut' is particularly high in sugar.  Check the can.  See how much sugar is added to it.    Coconut Milk doesn't have such a high sugar content.  It is what you need to make a curry.  You could use like 2-3 T of your cream of coconut in the curry sauce, but I doubt you'd like to use the whole can; would prob be too sweet.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	The only real difference is consistency; coconut cream is thicker than coconut milk because it contains less water.     The taste probably won't be much different, but the consistency may be off. You might want to add a little water to think it out.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	The cream of coconut is thicker then the milk, you can try watering the cream of coconut down. That should help.
xrRZeROmaa	The raw shrimp will take on more flavor from the marinade.  The precooked shrimp have already changed texture, and will resist soaking up marinade flavors.    In addition, if you are planning on cooking this in a pan, or on a BBQ, the raw shrimp will taste better, and be less tough than the precooked ones.  Reheating precooked shrimp makes them tough.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	I would think that the raw would absorb the flavor of the marinade better than the precooked.  Anyway, after marinading precooked, were you going to cook again? If so, you come very close to ending up with shrimp shaped rubber as over cooked shrimp are very rubbery.  They taste okay but feel like rubber in your mouth.  That is why many recipes say to add last.  They only need a minute or so to cook anyway.  Once they are pink, they are done.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Always marinate shrimp before cooking. Pre-cooked shrimp is meant only to be eaten on its own or with condiments.     Raw shrimp is marinated.     You can marinate with or without the shells on depending on whether or not you want to de-shell the shrimp before eating. They cook best with shells on because of the flavor, but it may be more convenient to shell them first.

Cc2Yb9DKaa	According to the USDA, if handle properly prior to and during thawing and refreezing, it is safe to consume.  However, freezing meat affects the texture and moisture of the meat, making it taste bad.|`|61f03830cdf19350bd8ba12e0328877caa	If you refreeze once, it's okay, as long as the meat was kept in the fridge the entire time.  The main effect is on the texture of the meat.    There are two main reasons why refreezing is bad...  1.  Ice crystals are sharp and jagged.  When water freezes it expands, puncturing the cell walls causing excessive fluid loss.    2.  Bacteria/Rotting: Bacteria is a greater concern if you thaw at room temperature, but can grow slowly in the fridge.  With the constant freeze/refreeze cycles, you can accumulate a high level... which means you really need to cook thoroughly.  Also, if you have some meat that's on the verge of going off.  Freezing does NOT reset the clock... in fact it may make it worse because of reason (1).|`|9852ceb5b2e40e61d23ad4d12d5c84caaa	Refreezing raw meat will increase the bacteria composition.  Bacteria tends to grow in cold environments - even within a freezer.    If you do refreeze it, I'd recommend that you cook it extremely thorough before eating it.|`|AA11101968	Once thawed, bacteria can set in that cannot necesarilly be killed from refreezing.
AA12095483	You do not get drunk from drinking water. You get drunk from drinking alcoholic beverages, because the alcohol affects the brain cells. When you drink excessive amounts of water, you dilute your body fluids and that can have serious consequences. If you drink more than a gallon of water a day, you are drinking to much water (unless you are trekking across the Sahara desert). If you deliberately drank huge amounts of water, you would not drown but you could go into cardiac arrest because your blood would thin out, along with your other body fluids.|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	Are you talking about water intoxication? Water is not toxic like alcohol is, so you don't really get drunk although you might have similar symptoms.    You would have to drink a lot of water really fast. Probably a couple of gallons every hour. And no, you wouldn't drown first. Drowning is something completely different.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You don't get drunk from water, you simply dilute your system which can result in death.|`|ACOsW9ytaa	Alcohol gets you drunk, not all liquids!|`|kmKF7AWPaa	You would have a seizure and then die.|`|5ZbaruBgaa	you wont get drunk and you wont die you would throw up before anything happened

zgugU4Gtaa	Kopi Luwak are robusta or arabica coffee beans which have been eaten by and passed through the digestive tract of the Common Palm Civet. This process takes place on the islands of Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago.<br>  <br>  "Kopi" is the Indonesian word for coffee and "Luwak" is local name of this animal which eats the raw red coffee 'cherries' as part of its usual diet. This animal eats a mixed diet of insects, small mammals and fruits along with the softer outer part of the coffee cherry but does not digest the inner beans, instead excreting them still covered in some inner layers of the cherry.<br>  <br>  Locals then gather the beans -- which come through the 'animal stage' fairly intact -- and sell them on to dealers. It is believed that enzymes in the stomach of the civet add to the coffee's flavour through fermentation of some type.<br>  <a href="http://www.indonesiangrocery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.indonesiangrocery.com/</a><br>  <br>  Not a CAT<br>  The Asian Palm Civet is a nocturnal omnivore. Ecologically, they are frequently compared to as filling a similar niche in Asia that the Common Raccoon fills in North America. Its primary food source is fruit such as chiku, mango, and rambutan. It will also eat small mammals and insects. It also has a fondness for palm flower sap which, when fermented, becomes toddy, a sweet liquor (habit which earns one of its alternate names the 'toddy cat'). It inhabits forests, parks and suburban gardens with mature fruit trees, fig trees and undisturbed vegetation. Its sharp claws allow it to climb trees and house gutters.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Palm_Civet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Palm_...</a><br>  <br>  The Coffee costs 160 bucks a pound.|`|4bedkpvLaa	yea im God awful serious and here is the website explaining everything in detail take a tour if you want. its also the most expensive and premium coffee in the world<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indonesiangrocery.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.indonesiangrocery.com/</a>

G9liglrwaa	WELL I THINK "BUTTERMILK" IS SELF EXPLANATORY AND SO IS "SOUR MILK"...WERE YOU BEING SARCASTIC?|`|onkUcy19aa	Traditionally, buttermilk is the liquid left over after producing butter from full-cream milk by the churning process. What you find the grocery store today is usually cultured buttermilk, that is milk to which Streptococci bacteria (a souring agent) have been added to simulate the cream. Even though buttermilk has a slightly sour taste, it is NOT sour mil and I would not recommend substituting Sour milk for Butter Milk. Sorry! The way to tell if Buttermilk is bad is usually the expiration date on the carton or, if the butter milk curdles, in other words, has lumps in it. <br>  <br>  Soured milk is a food product, distinguished from spoiled milk, and is a general term for milk that has acquired a tart taste, either through the addition of an acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar, or through bacterial fermentation. The acid causes milk to coagulate and form a thicker consistency. <br>  <br>  While sour milk is ordinary milk gone bad.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Buttermilk is the liquid that runs off when people are making butter.  Sour milk is just milk that has gone bad
a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	First of all, no matter what kind of tea you get, make sure you don't oversteep it. Leaving the tea in the water for too long will change its taste for the worst. Follow the directions on the package. <br>  <br>  Second of all, some teas taste much better with milk. Some teas are terrible with milk. Make sure you have that sorted out. Many black teas need milk while most green and herbal teas do not. <br>  <br>  Third of all, find your preferred sweetener. I like honey. Some people do not like honey. Avoid artificial sweeteners, as they are not healthy at all. Try honey, or real cane sugar, or agave nectar. Play around until you find what you like. <br>  <br>  You can also add fruit juice to your tea. Lemon is the one folks use most often, but try squeezing an orange over your tea. Drop in some cold strawberries to help cool it down. <br>  <br>  And finally, play around with the temperature. Some teas will taste better cold. Sometimes all you need to make your tea taste better is a few ice cubes.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Sucralose.|`|Bv0I2aRAaa	I enjoy just a lil honey...|`|hRA1faNoaa	Blimey!!! whats diet tea ??? !!!!!!!!!!!

Flavor depends of the type of plant and the mix used to create the tea. Darjeeling is different from White, Green, or the standard Black and none are like a Chai.<br>  <br>  Second, you should NEVER boil your tea in the water! Warm the water up in a microwave or in a kettle and then let it sit for just a bit. Water that is too hot will scorch the tea and make it bitter to taste. Then gently pour the water over the bag. Never let the tea steep for too long or it will become bitter and strong. However, you can still rescue this mixture. You can water down strong tea and chill it to make iced tea. If steeped for too long you create a concentrate.<br>  <br>  Personally, I find bagged teas to taste bad. The bag restricts the flow of water over the leaf. Loose leaf tea brewed in a tea pot and a tea ball make for a tea that is more palatable. If you can;t fine loose leaf, but you do have a teaball, cut open the bag and use the tea ball. I highly suggest you use a wire mesh teaball.<br>  <br>  Sugar, milk, ginger, and lemon can also be added to make a tea more flavorful. Never add things like lemon, sugar, or milk to the pot of tea. Always add when it's in the cup. Sometimes those additives will curdle or interact with the tea when left alone in the warm water.<br>  <br>  Additionally, regular Black tea may be just fine for you. In small amounts caffeine does stimulate the metabolism.|`|YmRv7lJXaa	Add just a splash of lemon juice.

Then drain grease, add BBQ sauce and cook for another hour. A lot of recipes for country ribs tell you to par boil them. This does help to make them tender, but I find that it also takes away a lot of the flavor and makes the meat a bit mushy.

I used to use McCormick's fajita seasoning, but came across this recipe and now I use this instead. I mix it up and store it in an airtight container and mark it fajita seasoning. I do this with a lot of my meals (chili seasoning, fish seasoning, etc.) I changed the original recipe up by cutting down on the salt and cayenne pepper and let my family add the "heat" by using a hotter salsa, etc.<br>  <br>  * 1 tablespoon cornstarch<br>  * 2 teaspoons chili powder<br>  * 1 teaspoon salt<br>  * 1 teaspoon paprika<br>  * 1 teaspoon sugar<br>  * 3/4 teaspoon crushed sodium-free chicken bouillon cube<br>  * 1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br>  * 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br>  * 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>  * 1/4 teaspoon cumin<br>  <br>  I slice up flank steak (the best cut for fajitas IMO) into thin strips and thinly julienne both red and green peppers and onions. Put all ingredients in a large ziploc bag. Add about 1 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of the seasoning mix. I let it sit about 20-30 minutes to soak up the flavors. Fry over med-high heat until veggies are tender and meat is cooked - doesn't take too long. Serve with warmed tortillas and an array of toppings - cheese, sour cream, guac, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa, etc. I let my family make their own fajitas.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Sausage & Peppers<br>  <br>      *   1 (8 ounce) package thin spaghetti<br>      * 4 (4 ounce) links sweet Italian sausage<br>      * 5 assorted bell peppers, seeded and cut into strips<br>      * 1 clove garlic, minced<br>      * 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br>      * salt and pepper to taste<br>      * 1/4 cup minced flat leaf parsley<br>      * freshly grated Parmesan cheese to taste<br>  <br>     1.   Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside.<br>     2. While the pasta is getting started, slice sausages lengthwise, and remove the casings. Brown sausages in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of the olive oil. Remove sausages to a platter, and keep warm in the oven. Add the bell peppers, garlic, oregano and basil to the skillet, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Saute over medium heat until peppers are tender.<br>     3. Toss the pepper mixture with the drained spaghetti until well blended, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, and arrange the sausages on the top. Garnish with Italian parsley and Parmesan cheese.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Chinese Pepper Steak<br>  <br>      * 1 pound boneless beef sirloin or round steak<br>      * 1 tablespoon Kikkoman Stir-Fry Sauce<br>      * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided<br>      * 2 bell peppers, cut into 1-inch squares<br>      * 2 onions, cut into 1-inch squares<br>      * 1/4 cup Kikkoman Stir-Fry Sauce<br>  <br>     1.

sqCvPQIRaa	My kids used to eat crisps everyday as part of lunch.  When we went on holiday abroad they were not available and having broken that habit we stopped buying them so now we only have crisps on special occasions.  The nice thing is that we then buy the really expensive ones and really realy enjoy them.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons I wanted to stop buying them everyday is the amount of packaging waste created. There is the outer packet and then the inner packets.  None of that is recylable. I even wrote to McCoys to make sure and they said the only way their packets could be destroyed was by burning!.<br>  <br>  Pringles are worse. They have a recyling logo on their packet but it turns out the only way you can recycle any of it is to remove both the inner and outer of the tube, and the bottom - and who would do that! <br>  <br>  Just tell yourself everytime you open a packet that you are personally putting that rubbish into landfill - self disgust can be a helpful motivator to get rid of an addiction.<br>  <br>  PS have you tried oatcakes?  Crunchy, tasty, filling  and they lower your cholestorel|`|ILpp3ncYaa	It has to be the salt, that is the only addictive thing.|`|vJa7abGfaa	i don't think they are but...i think the cheese and onion ones are..|`|D9DIEk8naa	they aer about as addictive as eating human excrement|`|t1lKsGmYaa	errr there horrible!|`|RW3SzwINaa	because of the salt|`|e6deb12b2a198fe4e6c1925ada7b1eb5aa	The carbs in the chips make you crave more.

a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	So here is my story. <br>  <br>  I was 13 years old (I am 27 now) and my uncle had shot a deer and gave my mom some of the meat. I told her I didn't want to eat the meat because, at the time, I believed that killing an animal in its own habitat was worse than raising an animal for food (of course I know better now, but give me a break! I was 13 and didn't have The Internetz). <br>  <br>  My mom told me I didn't have to eat it and put it in the freezer. Life went on. A short while later, she made chili and gave me some. Sat there and watched me eat it. When I was finished, she asked in a smug voice "So did you like the chili?" I said yes. She said "It had the deer meat in it." <br>  <br>  I said "I'm never eating meat again." And from that day forward, I have not eaten any meat. That was fourteen years ago. <br>  <br>  I've gotten more and more reasons to remain vegetarian (better for the environment, better for my body, better for the animals) but I've never gotten a reason to start eating meat. There is no reason to live a life sustained by the death of other creatures when I can live happily without it.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I was a veg head before the internet was born.  It wasn't a cool thing back then.  I couldn't find many soy products, so my diet was hardly healthy.  I had to quit it after two years.  That was back in the mid 80s.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	About 15 - 20 years ago. Because the animal suffers... no other reason.|`|aQG5pZlLaa	Been a vegetarian for almost a year now, for quite a few reasons:<br>  <br>  - It's healthier - lower fat, lower cholesterol, higher life expectancy (this is considering you have a balanced diet)<br>  <br>  - It's kinder to animals and kinder to the earth<br>  <br>  - It's cheaper.|`|OIFXOKnOaa	1995 I became veggie for animals. Then in 2002 I found out about how animal products are just as cruel as meat so I became vegan. Part of the reason was health as well since I used to get severe menstrual cramps and migraines and now I don't.|`|tatbIu54aa	I'm a vegan.<br>  I've been a vegan for my whole life.<br>  Because I love animals I don't want to kill them.<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS:)|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	vegan<br>  around 1990<br>  athletic performance|`|q4K3CAyaaa	I gradually went veggie when I was about 12 because I realised meat was gross and unfit for human consumption.<br>  I (again gradually) went vegan when I was 18 when I realized the extent of industrialisation in the egg and dairy industry. I also noticed immediate health benefits such as increased energy, weight loss and began to enjoy my food more than I ever had previously.<br>  <br>  To me vegetarianism is part of growing up. The arguments for it are so convincing on social, ethical, environmental, medical and economic grounds that there really is no reason to eat meat other than a weak character.|`|qHcEBN2Zaa	I was vegetarian since the moment I was born. My parents decided to go that way because it's healthier and it doesn't bring so much cruelty to animals. It's hard but it's worth it. People like us don't contribute so much to the population of certain rare species decreasing. I don't know what it's like converting FROM meat TO vegetarian but Ma and Pa say it was hard for them but it's totally worth it in the end if you know what you're doing.|`|957NbnkBaa	i became a lacto-ovo vegetarian in 2008, against my parents' and my whole family's wishes and since i live in egypt i get judged alot and get weird faces when people hear i am a vegetarian cause it's not that common, i never met a single vege person in my life.<br>  why? because it's cruel to the animals and just because we're the more powerful species doesnt mean we get to kill and slaughter then eat other living beings. its just inhuman.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	because the animals have a right to live, if they should be used for anything it should be things like milk and eggs but treated with respect and not cooped up in small spaces<br>  <br>  we don't NEED meat, there are perfectly other good foods available, it's just not fair on the animals, why would something live just to die?

Enjoy!|`|mkA615Ataa	depending on what you're cooking, fruit juice is a good alternative, or you could try any of the vast range of alcohol free wines, elderflower is a very nice one but you need a non-sparkling variety.|`|4KtPFzz5aa	Alcohol Substitutions in Cooking<br>  <a href="http://whatscookingamerica.net/alcoholsub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://whatscookingamerica.net/alcoholsu...</a>|`|nOVSf06Raa	Apple Cider|`|53giV6PFaa	Try a broth instead

b9uOax0aaa	You can eat chicken if you are able.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	No, you can't eat chicken and still call yourself a vegetarian. Eat more beans and nuts and other sources of protein. Dairy has a ton of protein if you eat that. Meat isn't the only way to go.|`|AA12324252	Real  vegetarians don't eat anything with a FACE. Find a DR. who is a vegetarian.someone who knows about vegetarianism. There are many things you can have as protein. Look it up!|`|KeevlZnTaa	Vegetarians do not eat chicken. If you are eating chicken than you are no longer vegetarian.<br>  <br>  I would suggest another doctor, or a trip to a nutritionist. Any doctor that thinks you are not getting enough protein is pretty uneducated. Protein deficiencies are rare, and mostly seen in third world countries that suffer from famine. Unless you are starving it is very unlikely that you are protein deficient. <br>  <br>  There are many sources of protein besides meat. <br>  High protein foods include:<br>  soy milk, tofu, nuts(Almonds, Cashews, Filberts, Hemp Seeds, Peanuts, Pumpkin seeds, Sesame seeds, Sunflower seeds, Walnuts (black)), seeds, legumes(Garbanzo beans, Kidney beans, Lentils, Lima beans, Navy beans, Soybeans, Split peas), grains(Barley, Brown rice, Buckwheat, Millet, Oatmeal, Rye, Wheat germ, Wheat, hard red, Wild rice), vegetables(Artichokes, Beets, Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Cucumbers, Eggplant, Green peas, Green pepper, Kale, Lettuce, Mushrooms, Mustard green, Onions, Potatoes, Spinach, Tomatoes, Turnip greens, Watercress, Yams, Zucchini), fruits(Apple, Banana, Cantaloupe, Grape, Grapefruit, Honeydew melon, Orange, Papaya, Peach, Pear, Pineapple, Strawberry)<br>  <br>  The average person only needs about 50 grams per day. A bowl of oatmeal with milk gives you 12 grams, and that's just breakfast. Add a glass of orange juice and your up to 15.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you go and get a few cook books. There are many kid friendly books about vegetarianism that you may find helpful.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Since when did a chicken not be meat? why not try cheese and eggs for protein? if not eating meat is making you unwell you could stop being a vegi for a while until you get better, it`s not a crime to eat meat|`|VdbhuUYBaa	No.<br>  <br>  If your Dr. doesn't know other sources of protein I wouldn't trust him with your health.|`|6qGY4cljaa	If your doctor suggests you're not getting enough protein, then apparently you're not a very good vegetarian. As a vegetarian, you have to change your sources of vitamins. Eating leafy greens is not going to cut it. If you need proteins then you should eat more beans and nuts. You body requires vitamins and minerals, and if you cannot get it though your diet, you will have to supplement it with pills.<br>  <br>  And the rule of thumb is that if a thing had a nervous system, it's probably not something you can eat if you're a vegetarian.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Your doctor is ignorant. He/She had one course in nutrition and not only did not have to pass it (s)he obviously did not understand it.<br>  Chicken is not a feathered vegetable. It is an animal and loaded with growth hormones and salmonella. Bad choice.<br>  If you are lacking in protein I would suggest that you explore Quinoa which is an ancient South American contribution to the vegetarian world  -- a grain containing all 7 essential amino acids (proteins), It is quick and easy to prepare and they have conveniently turned it into pasta for you too. My suspicion is that you are probably missing B12 which is found in Tempeh and Nutritional Yeast.  <br>  Whole grain foods and beans or legumes, tofu, tempeh and fresh veggies and fruit provide adequate protein for entire cultures to live healthfully.  Don't give up on your conscience driven choices just make sure that you are paying attention to what you do eat. You cannot be healthy living on fast food and a lot of junk.<br>  If you want great recipes check out www.your-vegetarian-kitchen.com  and veg123.com|`|e319dd7fc367cb467844fd4db759150caa	No. If you are eating it then it's being killed. You can get protein from MANY other places. Tofu is a great source, also BEANS. lots of beans and rice, will give you a complete protein. Dont eat the chicken!|`|spS2lnDXaa	No. How is that not meat?<br>  <br>  If you are not getting enough protein, you evidently aren't putting much thought into your diet.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	No, you are not!  You can get protein from sources other than meat or poultry.<br>  <br>  Here's some information from The Vegetarian Society about where you can get protein from<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html</a>|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well no. They're still animals that get killed.<br>  <br>  Try looking for other foods with protein in them, or you could consider taking protein pills.<br>  <br>  Everything you need can also be found in non-meat products.|`|aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	Look at it this way: your doctor says you're sick because of your vegetarian diet. What's more important to you: your own health and well being, or the reason you become vegetarian? <br>  <br>  Eat chicken!|`|4FWrRRF2aa	Depends. If you want to stay sick, no.|`|eL268hETaa	If you eat chicken, you are officially no longer a vegetarian.  Some vegetarians call themselves VEGAN and don't even eat chicken eggs either.<br>  <br>  If you need protein and wish to remain vegetarian, then you need to up your intake of nuts, soybeans, peanut butter (the non-salmonella type), tofu, etc.  You can also go to your local nutrition center and get chewable protein wafers and high protein granola bars.  Protein calorie malnutrition can be life threatening.  The human body needs some sort of protein to survive, but it does not have to come from chicken.  Your doctor should know that, but obviously is against vegetarianism for some reason.  A simple blood test for albumin and total serum protein can tell you how bad your protein deficiency is.  Did he run those tests?  If not, find a new doctor!|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Is chicken a plant? Come on now. <br>  <br>  I would also seek another doctor. Most doctors have little to no nutritional training.|`|mPgydPKGaa	absolutely not
xMCuUvd4aa	You need the proper utensils, and of course  the salty, buttery stuff.  I think if you spread the biscuit open and let the heat of the biscuit warm the edge of the tool/blade, it helps the butter flow more easily before you really get to spreading it.  <br>  Taking your time getting it everywhere is really helpful and very enjoyable.

C72c6xr1aa	Home Remedies For Roaches<br>  <br>  Baking Soda<br>  <br>  Touted by some as one of the most ridiculous home remedies for roaches, and by others as being highly effective, mix equal parts of baking soda and powdered sugar and then apply it to problem areas.<br>  <br>  Roach Dough<br>  <br>  Combine 1/4 cup shortening, 1/2 cup onions, 1/2 cup flour and 8 ounces baking soda. Add enough water to bring it to a consistency of dough.<br>  <br>  Garlic Onion Pepper Mix<br>  <br>  This seems to be one of the home remedies for roaches that several people agree on. Mix one clove of garlic, one onion, 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper and 1 quart of water. Let it all soak for 1 hour.<br>  <br>  Add 1 tablespoon of liquid soap and spray it around the house to control roaches.<br>  <br>  Bleach Pinesol Mix<br>  <br>  Shanequa from Clarkston Georgia writes: "Mix 2 cups of bleach, 2 cups of pinesol and 1 cup of hot boiling water and pour it on the area where the roaches are, and wait about 10 minutes to get rid of the roaches."<br>  <br>  Shanequa adds: "Be careful, this is one of those home remedies for roaches where the smell is very strong!"|`|qpln6o9Yaa	If the roaches are this bad, they are in your walls and that takes a professional to treat them.  Buy Boric Acid and put it in every nook and cranny of your house. They love it and carry it back to the nest and it kills the others.

All you can do is let him know you will be there to support him if he wishes to seek help himself and leave it at that.|`|5dMw30kMaa	I'm really sorry to hear this :( But I think you should try getting your whole family together to give him an intervention.

But that doesent work all the time. No one can force him u can he gets the help and stops.|`|4miydCxaaa	No. He has to want to do it himself. Not even sure if this is a serious questions any google search or lifetime movie will tell you the same thing.|`|yezbmlaKaa	He needs to want to stop drinking, otherwise he isn't going to stop. You can hold an intervention, but be sure to have a professional (from AA or a rehab center) be there to facilitate. I'm sorry that you have to live with this, but it is his choice. You love your brother, you just don't love the decisions he has been making. <br>  Again, I've been through this myself with someone I know and love. It's going to be rough. They aren't going to like you if you have an intervention. This is why you must have at least one professional there to help assist. They are there to support you just as much as they are there to support him. It's going to be tough, but if you really need to do it, then this is the best way. Also, offer to go to AA meetings with him.<br>  <br>  You might want to look into Al-Anon. It's a support group for people who have been affected by alcoholics or drug abusers in their life. It's helpful, it's support for you. It's comforting to know that you aren't the only person out there going through this.

b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Well having identified the situation you have identified the solution. You need to eat whole grains -- brown rice, quinoa, and beans, legumes, tofu & tempeh. Fresh salads and veggies and you need to drink half of your body weight in ounces of pure water every day. The way to handle that on an erratic schedule is to cook a pot of beans or legumes and a pot of brown rice on the one day that you have some significant time at home. Portion it into containers and freeze or refrigerate them. You can diversify the flavors by the sauces, herbs and spices to keep your interest in them, turn some of them into soups others into casseroles, and still others into sandwich spread by the judicious use of a food processor and some eggless, dairy free mayonaisse. You can even turn the beans and rice mixture into burgers by adding herbs, tomato sauce and rolled oats. What is wanted is a little creativity and some self love!

kpvsxlA6aa	Opened, same as with all other cream liqueurs that are around 17% ABV, a long long time.  Alcohol is a preservative (hence the term "getting pickled" as slang for getting drunk).  The most important things are to keep it relatively cool (less than about 85 degrees F), and keep it in a dark bottle.  Light (those nasty UV rays you keep hearing about) isn't just bad for eyes and skin, it's also bad for dairy products and alcohol (that's why the best beers are sold in lightproof bottles, the next best are in very dark bottles, then comes beer in cans, and the worst beers are in clear bottles or plastic.  It's also why milk in cardboard or lightproof plastic containers sometimes seems to taste better than milk in opaque plastic jugs).<br>  <br>  Kept on a shelf with your other liquor, it should be just fine for six months or a year.  Keep in mind that if the lid is left off the bottle, though, you'll evaporate the alcohol away pretty quickly (within a few days or so).<br>  <br>  Unopened, it will last for years, if kept cool and dark as mentioned.|`|3paA4nocaa	6 months

As overall he holds more michelin stars that Heston...<br>  But really its down to personal opinion...<br>  :)<br>  I would s\y the best chef in the world would have to be...<br>  >Jo?l Robuchon<br>  Who is French...|`|1LB7NBhcaa	delia smith just such a nice person i worked at her restaurant in norwich football club and she always makes time to have a chat and dont mind getting her hands dirty and also will talk you through if you get it wrong as for gordon if hed swore at me hed have a rolling pin up his bot but if you cook something and its for just you and some mates and they like it in there eyes your a great chef|`|5KcUyLFRaa	I'm not so sure, but he's definately the most famous.<br>  Plus he seems to be very passionate about his subject and have a great business mind.|`|837xgMwLaa	No, just one of the most famous.|`|4P7N6XULaa	er no, although he is the best swearer|`|FR4fzr4Zaa	no i dont fink so -x|`|QBFbvO21aa	he is one of the most famous, cocky, and addicting chefs for sure.<br>  plus he is not so attractive but has a total sex appeal to him, <br>  I'd love to meet him and even taste his food.<br>  But the biggest complaint i heard is his food is too simple and bland.<br>  he is too old fashioned. <br>  I love his shows, and i beleive he beats the good out of every chef, even if people thinks he is an ***.....he is what they need.<br>  He def is one of the best.<br>  brilliant.|`|rOQlyrXpaa	No, he is the best in the world. He has such vision to see clearly what is wrong with each restaurant. He does something slightly different each time, but he always hits the nail on the head as to what the problem is. Usually it's got something to do with the owner's ego!|`|7AUqSr4uaa	He's good, but Heston is deffo the best in my opinion.<br>  <br>  There are lots of great chefs in the UK who will never get on telly.<br>  Just cos he's on telly doesnt mean he's the best, but he is very ambitious and assertive.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	i wouldnt say hes the best, i would say at the moment he is the most famous. Hes obviously a great chef, i love his shows. But there has to be better chefs in england|`|aHvJcb0uaa	maybe, but my favourite is delia smith!!! shes from norwich, wooo go norwich!!!!!  gordon ramsay is definitely the best chef in london though.|`|LazJHDzVaa	no he is a boring sell out hipocrit|`|PKYzSzYxaa	my vote goes to Jamie Oliver|`|m9VCXQPXaa	i agree, just one of the best.

PDotv2Hsaa	Here's an excellent and easy recipe that I've tried out. It can be applied to chicken, fish or pork.<br>  <br>  Ingredients :<br>  <br>  500g Chicken, cubed <br>  1 bell pepper, cut into cubes<br>  1 tomato, cut into wedges<br>  3 rings of canned pineapple, cut into cubes<br>  1 cup of frozen peas or mixed vegetables<br>   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped <br>  1/2 large onion - cut into cubes<br>  1 tsp corn starch<br>  <br>  Batter: 1 egg, with salt, pepper and 2tbsp flour.<br>   <br>  Sauce:<br>  4 tbsp Tomato sauce or puree<br>  2 tbsps white vinegar<br>  2 tbsps soy sauce<br>  1 tsp sugar <br>  1/2 cup water<br>  Pinch of salt<br>  Dash of pepper<br>  <br>  Method :<br>  1) Marinate the meat with 1 tbsp soy sauce, pinch of salt, dash of pepper, sesame oil and 3 tbsps corn starch. Set aside for at least half an hour.<br>  <br>  2) Dip the meat in the batter (you can dip it in bread crumbs here if you want but that isn't really authentic) and deep fry the meat. Remove from heat and drain the meat on paper towels. <br>  <br>  3) Heat a little oil and saute the garlic and onions for 2-3 minutes.<br>  <br>  4) Add the ingredients for the sauce. Bring to a boil before adding the bell pepper, tomato, pineapple, frozen peas / mixed vegetables.<br>  <br>  5) Let it cook for about 3 minutes. <br>  <br>  6) Finally, dissolve the corn starch in 2 tbsp of water and add it to the pan to thicken the sauce.<br>  <br>  7) To serve, pour the sauce over the meat just before serving.|`|4bedkpvLaa	Sweet and Sour Chicken With Lemon<br>  Ingredients:<br>  Chicken Bits:<br>  2 pounds skinned, de-boned chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces<br>  1 cup all-purpose flour<br>  A little fresh ground black pepper, ground ginger and garlic powder to season flour (not a lot)<br>  1/2 cup milk<br>  2 eggs<br>  Vegetable oil<br>  Vegetables:<br>  1 green bell pepper, washed, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch square bits<br>  1 red bell pepper, washed, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch square bits<br>  1 large yellow onion, skinned, root end removed, cut into 1/2-inch bits<br>  2 medium carrots, peeled and trimed, slice thinly on the diagonal<br>  1 20-ounce can pineapple chunks in juice (no added sweeteners) <br>  Sweet and Sour Sauce:<br>  1/2 cup reserved pineapple juice<br>  1 cup water<br>  1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>  1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br>  3 tablespoons lemon juice<br>  4 - 6 drops red food coloring<br>  2 rounded tablespoons corn starch mixed in enough cold water to make a slurry<br>  Preparation:<br>  Directions for Making Chicken Bits<br>  When cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces, remove any fat, gristle or connective tissue. If the chicken is soft-frozen or almost thawed it is easier to cut.<br>  In small frying pan, add 1/2-inch vegetable oil. Heat to deep-frying temperature.<br>  In a bowl mix eggs and milk. Beat until well combined.<br>  Place flour and seasonings in a shallow bowl and mix.<br>  Dunk pieces of chicken in the egg and milk mixture. Allow excess to drain.<br>  Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour coating thoroughly. Here is your chance to practice with your chop sticks and keep the flour off from your fingers.<br>  Drop pieces into the hot oil and fry until deep golden brown. Turn as necessary to cook evenly on all sides. When golden brown, remove to paper towel covered plate to drain.<br>  Repeat until all chicken pieces are cooked. Set aside until assembly.<br>  <br>  Directions for Making Sweet and Sour Sauce<br>  Place pineapple and water in sauce pan. Heat over low flame. Slowly add sugar while stirring.<br>  When sugar has dissolved, slowly add the vinegar and the lemon juice while stirring.<br>  Add corn starch slurry and stir while heating. Bring to a boil.<br>  Stir constantly until thickened. Add food coloring (a couple drops at first and then adjust until you have the red color you like) and stir well to mix. Continue to heat and stir until almost a syrup. Remove from heat and set aside.<br>  Note: You will be judging the thickness of the sauce while it is hot. It will thicken considerably when it is set aside and cools. Later, when added to the vegetables, the moisture from the vegetables will thin the sauce quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Directions for Assembling Completed Dish<br>  Add a little vegetable oil to a large frying pan or wok. Bring to frying temperature over medium heat. Add vegetables (but not the pineapple) and cook, stirring frequently, until onions begin to caramelize.<br>  Add sweet and sour sauce and continue cooking and stirring until vegetable are bite tender and sauce has re-thickened and clings to the vegetables.<br>  Add pineapple and chicken bits and fold into the vegetables and sauce. Simmer until heated through. Serve.<br>  Most home-made sweet and sour sauces are made with brown sugar and the sauce has the distinctive coffee color of the molasses in the brown sugar. This recipe produces a red sweet and sour sauce that looks just like the Chinese restaurant take-out food but we think that it tastes a lot better. Try it and see how easy it is to make tasty oriental-style food at home.|`|3paA4nocaa	I can't remember where I got the original recipe, but this is my interpretation<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 pack of ranch dressing mix<br>  <br>  <br>  1 cup of panko bread brumbs<br>  <br>  <br>  1 1/2 pounds chicken breast<br>  <br>  <br>  1 egg<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Combine the ranch dressing mix and panko bread crumbs in a small bowl. Whisk the egg in another small bowl. Dip chicken breasts in egg, then in panko mixture. Spray a 9x13 glass baking dish with non-stick spray and bake at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I served this alongside corn on the cob and mashed potatoes!

That's your job, 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, 365 days a year.<br>  <br>  Reserve is basically like saying "part-time".  Basically, being in the "Reserves" is like being on the bench in sports.  You aren't in the military full-time, and it isn't your full-time job. However, being in the reserves, you can get "called up" to Active Duty at anytime.  Most in the reserves are also called "weekend warriors".  Most have another full-time job.

yoytdRGTaa	As far as I know, Florida has no laws limiting the alcohol content of beer.  A Coors, or Budweiser, or whatever should be the same in FL as it is in MS, GA, AL or LA.  Many have the alcohol content printed on the label now, so it's easy to check.<br>  <br>  I know when I'm on vacation, it's not unusual for me to drink a lot more than I would at home and not notice it.<br>  <br>  Of course, back in the day, there was the enduring mystique of Coors, which wasn't available east of the Mississippi River.  Since they couldn't get it, people automatically thought it was some sort of special beer that was worthy of bringing in from out of state.  It was even the basis for the movie "Smokey and the Bandit".  In reality, it had more to do with marketing than with the alcohol content of the beer.<br>  <br>  If you just want to be on the safe side and grab some brew from another state, I'd make the stop in Alabama.
FGyBCGZYaa	Royal icing is egg whites, confectioners' sugar, and water; possibly flavoring, but generally not.  If the icing is made with raw egg whites, you run the same risk of salmonella poisoning as you would eating undercooked eggs.  If the icing is made with pasteurized egg whites, it is safe to eat.  Royal icing dries hard, as you found out.  Royal icing is generally used to make icing decorations that need to set up before being put on a cake, e.g., daffodils, pansies.  Royal icing is also used to ice cookies.  The little hard sugar decorations you buy to put on cakes are royal icing.|`|zUmJ8ZFZaa	It's meant to be eaten, but it does harden up on you.

Simply cover it with tinfoil, don't put water in the bottom lest you dilute the cooking juices.  Or put it in an enamel roaster with a good tight lid.

Bv0I2aRAaa	First you need to thaw them...this step is quite obvious...<br>  <br>  Second season both sides of the steaks...<br>  <br>  Third, do not follow what the directions state...you will want to sear them on the stove top over high heat then transfer to a 400 degree oven to finish...<br>  <br>  The only difference between the two steaks will be how long they'll stay in the oven...this of course will depend on how you like them done...but if you go past Medium Rare you might as well bought hamburger meat...|`|qZ0310yVaa	broiling is your best bet they are good steaks|`|d19faee87d87426beb4d19828a1ffbdaaa	After completely thawing them. Let the meat come to room temperature, and then BROIL or grill whichever one you choose to cook. Season with black pepper and garlic powder ( not garlic salt ) and cook to the doneness that you like. Searing the meat for one minute on each side is the way I cook any steak. Then 2 minutes on each side, then 3, and so on. The length of time you cook a steak depends on the thickness of it and how rare or well done you like it. Add salt at the table. Salt on raw beef can make it tough.|`|oymv7Sk4aa	I can't cook|`|53giV6PFaa	Thaw completely in the fridge.  Let sit about 30 minutes on the counter before you cook them.  Use kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder - sprinkle both sides.  Don't really need to tenderize these 2 cuts of meat, they are tender cuts already.<br>  <br>  Heat a skillet over med-high heat and put some butter in it.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how you prefer you steak, but you can follow the chart on this site.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gourmetsouth.com/steakchart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gourmetsouth.com/steakchart.h...</a><br>  <br>  I usually use a thicker ribeye and do 3-4 minutes to get a nice med. rare.  Another thing you can do, is to feel the steak.  A medium rare should feel like the fleshy part of your palm by your thumb.  The firmer it feels the more well-done it is.  Do not cut or pierce your steak while cooking to see how it is done - it only leads to drying out the steak.  Only flip once in the pan.<br>  <br>  Let sit 10 minutes before you serve so the juice redistribute thoughout the steak.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	1/2" Ribeyes?  man, thats thin.  You can quick brown them in a skillet and use a sauce to simmer them in for an hour to make a more tender meat.  I would broil the NYStrips, 10 minutes on each side for medium.<br>  <br>  You can use a bernaise sauce, bbque sauce, gravies or anything else you have on hand.  I think the bernaise sauce calls for milk, so I would use powdered milk instead.  Add water to the skillet and simmer for 45 minutes.  Then add enough powdered milk to the dried bernaise (comes in packets like gravies).  Add some more water to the powders and stir before adding to the skillet.  Simmer another 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  I do pork chops that way.  I make the gravy from the water that the chops simmered in for a more flavorful gravy.  Ribeyes are usually the most fatty of the steaks, so you might think about trimming the fat or defatting the water before adding anything to it.|`|YmRv7lJXaa	You can pan fry either one of them which I recommend over broiling because they are both so thin. I would thaw them first in the fridge. Season with onion powder and garlic powder or just use salt and pepper and sear the 1/2 inch steak on a pretty high heat. Both sides will really only take a minute each. The one inch goes on about medium high obviously for a little longer but not much. Put some olive oil or bacon fat in the pan first, heat it up and then add the steak, Once you get used to cooking them you'll enjoy it and buying steaks on sale is a great way to get it. I do it all the time.

Here is one of them: <a href="http://www.drinkoftheweek.com/entertain/Party_planning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drinkoftheweek.com/entertain/...</a><br>  <br>  Even a list from the experts is not a sure thing if your guests are college age.  I have noticed that young adults tend to be followers when it comes to alcohol.  If one influential person starts drinking White Russians, for example, you will probably need to send out for a case of cream and more Kahlua within an hour because everyone will want one.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you keep it simple.  Don't try to have everyone's favorite drink---it will drive you nuts.  Provide a red wine, a white wine, a beer, a light beer, and one punch or cocktail that you can concoct in bulk that is currently popular in your crowd.  Don't forget some soft drinks, too.  Most people who are enjoying drinks on someone else's dime will be grateful for the choices.|`|Ixb3nCIDaa	Vodka is pretty good, can drink or mix with anything and Rum is a good basic spirit. I think what you got is enough and cater to most|`|pPfTVrKmaa	Wow, I really hope that you are not providing all the alcohol because drinks for over 100 people is going to be VERY expensive.  Jungle Juice is a very good choice for parties, and it will get people pretty drunk fast, and then you can go around asking for money donations which you will definitely get.

FCY3lwnoaa	If you are going to eat a completely vegetarian diet, you absolutely MUST learn how to get complete proteins into your diet.    (You must have protiens to make your meal last you through a school day!)<br>  <br>  For example, when combined Peanut Butter and Milk can substitute for meat.  Same with rice and beans.  <br>  <br>  It is true that you do not need to eat them together in the same meal in order to get the benefits of combined proteins, but you do need to get them into your diet.  Otherwise a vegetarian diet will be very unhealthy.  If you keep eating the same meal over and over, it will become unhealthy because you will be missing out on most of the nutrients AND you will become very bored with your diet.  Futhermore, since you are limited to one meal duirng the school day, it is a really good idea to get combined protiens in this meal to make it last through the day. <br>  <br>  Double check with your school about YOU being allowed to eat peanut butter.  When they say nuts are banned, I am pretty sure they are talking about people bringing in foods to share with others.  <br>  <br>  If you are old enough to decide to become a vegetarian and make your own meals, you are responsible enough to know not to share your food with others.<br>  <br>  IF you are going to continue eating a vegetarian diet, you ned to take this seriously and learn what you must eat in order to maintain a healthy diet.  <br>  <br>  You can make tasty sandwhiches with hummus spreads and you can find hummus spreads at most grocery stores these days.  They come plian, garlic, lemon, dill, spicy, etc.  I like a sandwhich made with hummus spread and cucumber slices.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you go to a library and check out copies of Vegetarian magazine and look at a few Vegetarian cookbooks.  The Moosewood Cookbooks are a staple in the homes of every vegetarian I know!  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b_1_9?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=moosewood+cookbook+vegetarian&sprefix=moosewood" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b_1_9?...</a><br>  <br>  ADDED:  <br>  <br>  1.   Also, you can make a batch of hard boiled eggs and put two in your lunch box. To make a good hard-boiled egg use the time honored "old, cold, and rolled" rule.  To make hard-boiled eggs that peel easily use OLD eggs, (use about two-weeks after purchase).<br>  <br>  Place the eggs in a pan and add enough water to cvover by at leat an inch.  Bring the water to a boil and then cover with a lid and remove from heat.  Let sit in hot water for 15 minutes.  Then run them under cool water to stop the cooking.  Do not attempt to peel until they are COLD.  <br>  <br>  When you do go to peel the eggs, ROLL them on the table or coutner to crack the shell thoroughly.<br>  <br>  If you follow these steps, OLD, COLD, ROLLED, you won't waste a bunch of the egg when you go to peel it.  : ) <br>  <br>  2.   Anojther really good product are the pastas made with extra protein.  Barilla makes one.  Their pastas with extar protein come in a yellow box and are called Barilla Plus.  Make a dish the night before and take it to school the next day.<br>  <br>  Egg noodles would also be good for you.<br>  <br>  3.

zGFiWSPtaa	You're not supposed to eat anything sticky like gum, gummy bears, laffy taffy, etc. You're also not supposed to eat hard things like carrots, apples, jolly ranchers, but you are allowed to cut them up into little pieces (u would most likely do this with the apple and carrot only). Popcorn is offlimits too. But, you'll notice that many people don't follow the rules. I don't say it's right, but I never did and my braces were fine.

cLa7nwhcaa	Your assertion is suspect<br>  1. Majority of people at home and most of the restaurants now a days, use vegetable oil. It is not hydrogenated. It is simply a corn, canola, or soya oil.<br>  2. Next comes is the use of Ghee. Ghee is derived from butter. It may be high in saturated fats, and contain cholesterol. But, it is not hydrogenated<br>  3. Minority of people use Vanaspati. Vanaspati is a hydrogenated oil used as a cheap substitute for Ghee. Since the information came about, Indian people at home switched back to Ghee. In United States, a restaurant would be committing a suicide if it was using Vanaspati. In New York with the largest population of Indian restaurants, Vanaspati by law is forbidden in Indian restaurants.<br>  May be you are talking about UK. Yes it is possible that some of the restaurants in UK are using Vanaspati. But I would not make the blanket assertion your querry made.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Doesn't matter.  Humans are omnivorous, like pigs and bears.  Nothing you can eat in a restaurant will harm you, as long as the Chef washes his hands.  (also the kitchen porter).|`|aCDWwsisaa	If you were a chef, you might realize how dumb it is to label an entire cuisine with any single characteristic.  Every bit as dumb as saying "Indians are better at math than Chinese"....the amount of hydrogenated fat in food depends on the specific dish.<br>  <br>  And as a chef, you really ought to learn to spell "bon appetit"!<br>  <br>  <br>  From one of your other rants against saturated fat:<br>  <br>  "..........Bing.......an arterial by-pass waiting for you soon...............Bon Apetit"<br>  <br>  You REALLY need a hobby!|`|BWxSSADaaa	In principle, neither of them is traditionally full of hydrogenated fats, as those are a fairly recent invention (this century).  <br>  <br>  For cooking Indian cuisine uses ghee or oil.  I think most Chinese dishes are prepared with oil as well.  <br>  <br>  As far as packaged items go, any item with fats that is sitting on a store shelf for a long time is probably made with hydrogenated fats, whether it's Indian, Chinese, Arabic, French, American, Italian, WHATEVER.|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	I am a chef as well and guess what, my friend, vegetarian Indian cuisine is made with vegetable oil and ghee -- not hydrogenated - one molecule away from plastic - margarine. <br>  Much of Chinese Vegetarian Cuisine is made with peanut oil or soy oil. <br>  I don't know where you are getting your information but I think you need to do some better research.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes i did and it contains way more artificial colours and flavours x|`|kzRmafpWaa	It depends on what your idea of Indian food and Chinese food is. Indian people don't typically eat restaurant dishes like butter chicken every day. Also, there is a lot of different regional Indian cuisine, whereas most restaurant food is Northern Indian. <br>  The same goes for Chinese food, my friend is Chinese and makes a lot of pickled things and soups that aren't like restaurant dishes.
GLOBmh0Baa	Some hens will lay double-yolked eggs as the result of unsynchronized production cycles. Although heredity causes some hens to have a higher propensity to lay double-yolked eggs, these occur more frequently as occasional abnormalities in young hens beginning to lay. Usually a double-yolked egg will be longer and thinner than an ordinary single-yolk egg. Double-yolked eggs occur rarely, and will only lead to the successful development of two embryos with human intervention<br>  <br>  It is also possible for a young hen to produce an egg with no yolk at all. Yolkless eggs are usually formed about a bit of tissue that is sloughed off the ovary or oviduct. This tissue stimulates the secreting glands of the oviduct and a yolkless egg results.|`|34VTIYpjaa	far out...thats actually amazing!!<br>  it's never happened to me....the chance is ridiculously low!<br>  enjoy  :)|`|knmxq1o4aa	This happened to me once.

53giV6PFaa	3 days max for raw chicken.  However, it also depends on the marinade.  An acidic marinade (citrus juices, vinegar, wine) should not be left on for more than a few hours (at least no longer than a day) on meat, it can change the texture of your chicken.|`|p0guNQhiaa	Chicken is a finicky thing and keeping it fresh is a trick.<br>  <br>  If it's raw, I would give it 3 days, in a tightly sealed container at the VERY most and even then, cook it very, VERY well (but you should always make sure chicken is cooked very, VERY well anyhow ... it's a pretty frequent cause of food poisoning).<br>  <br>  If it's cooked, you probably have a couple extra days.<br>  <br>  Personally, Once I buy my chicken, I freeze it unless I'm planning on eating it the next day. I don't really like leaving it out more than 24 hours. It brings back memories of a microbiology project I once did in university ... the results were not encouraging.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, the sooner you cook it, the safer you are.
6qGY4cljaa	You may have cooked it too long. And you also may have left the cookie on the cookie sheet for too long. You should remove them form the sheet after cooking, least they continue to cook from residual heat.

But i love tea... So i drink all kinds of tea...<br>  <br>  Aslo, tea is more healthier than Coffee.|`|eL268hETaa	THE absolute best type of coffee is Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.  Costs over $25.00 per pound (last I bought any) so you best sample it first.<br>  <br>  It's also nice to try your favourite regular coffee New Orleans' style by adding a pinch of chicory during brewing to take out the bitter aftertaste, or Mexican style with a dash of cinnamon.  You can also look for different roasts of the same coffee beans, which changes the taste tremendously.<br>  <br>  I have over 65 different kinds of tea in my house, and still try different types when i can find them.  Prince of Wales tea is very nice, but so is Formosa Oolong, Darjeeling, and Chinese Gunpowder Tea - which is the kind they serve in Chinese restaurants - so called because the tea leaves are rolled into tiny "gunpowder" pellets.  Arabic teas contain mint and aid digestion.  Herbal teas can make you relax and feel sleepy with chamomile and hibiscus flowers.  Red raspberry leaf tea is a cure for menstrual cramps.  Green teas, black teas, white teas... There simply is not enough time to answer your question to the extent of what is in my kitchen cabinets.  And besides, the teas i love, you may not like at all.  I applaud your sense of adventure though.  Drink up and keep trying !

hP2nzb2haa	A glow in the dark party is pretty simple.You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party.<br>  Your party be in the evening, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. white balloons are the best, just put the glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some glow in the dark paint that is invisible unless it is dark and make loads of banners to put on your walls. Let guests paint on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. tell friend to do the same, if they want to.Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each others faces! White will glow against the black lights very well.<br>  <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelery<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewellery sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. <br>  <br>  Get black lights and ask everyone to wear all white. their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula hoops, hot potatoe with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor.( Two are balls are perfect.)<br>  Have a great time!|`|W3F7xeF5aa	beach party with a bonfire, if you live near the sea or just rent a hall and a DJ, you can't go wrong.|`|Gr70BLaOaa	beer beer and more beer trust me i know|`|49niWB6Qaa	Well what does she do?

Gluten is what helps to hold baked goods together.<br>  <br>  If flour doesn't say on the package that it is self-rising, you will need to add salt and baking powder in order to get it to rise (to bake cakes, etc.)|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	All purpose flour is in fact plain flour that can be used for all purposes from making bread to making cakes etc.,  You only need to add baking powder to make a cake or anything that calls for self raising flour.

Cover and chill 1 hour.<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 375°.<br>  <br>  To prepare cake, place a rack in the lower third of oven. Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Sift together flour, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, and ginger in a medium bowl. Sift together remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 3/4 cup granulated sugar in another bowl. Place egg whites in a large bowl; beat with a mixer at high speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar and salt; beat until soft peaks form. Add powdered and granulated sugar mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until stiff peaks form. Sift flour mixture over egg white mixture, 1/4 cup at a time; fold in. Fold in 2 tablespoons juice.<br>  <br>  Spoon batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan, spreading evenly. Break air pockets by cutting through batter with a knife. Bake at 375° for 30 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Invert pan; cool completely. Loosen cake from sides of pan using a narrow metal spatula. Invert the cake onto a plate.<br>  <br>  Cut 1 inch off top of cake using a serrated knife; set top of cake aside. Hollow out bottom of cake using a small knife, leaving a 1-inch-thick shell; reserve torn cake for another use.<br>  <br>  To prepare whipped cream, place cream in a medium bowl; beat with a mixer at high speed until soft peaks form. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into bowl; discard pod. Gradually add 3/4 cup powdered sugar, beating at high speed until stiff peaks form.<br>  <br>  Spoon all but 1 cup of berry mixture into cake shell; top with whipped cream. Replace top of cake; sprinkle with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar. Serve immediately with additional berry mixture; garnish with orange rind, if desired.<br>  <br>  Whipped Cream Basics: For perfect whipped cream, use a bowl that's large enough to allow the cream to double in volume. Refrigerate the bowl and beaters for at least half an hour, or place them in the freezer for 15 minutes, and make sure the cream is very cold. Use the freshest whipping cream available, and add sugar, vanilla, or any other ingredients near the end of whipping; adding them too soon in the process will decrease the amount of volume you achieve.<br>  <br>  Nutritional Information<br>  Calories:269 (20% from fat)<br>  Fat:6g (sat 3.5g,mono 1.6g,poly 0.4g) <br>  Protein:5.2g<br>  Carbohydrate:50.2g<br>  Fiber:2.9g<br>  Cholesterol:20mg<br>  Iron:1.2mg<br>  Sodium:149mg<br>  Calcium:26mg|`|swFLFTgNaa	Sponge cake!<br>  3 eggs <br>  6oz flour<br>  6oz butter<br>  6oz sugar<br>  <br>  Put it all together and mix for 8 mins<br>  Put in 2 tins in 180 degrees oven for 20 mins<br>  Put jam and cream on top of one side and sandwich them together.<br>  Top with sieved icing sugar to make it look very professional!<br>  <br>  Hope it turns out well! :)x|`|uFNV289Waa	since its morning, pancakes w/ cinammon cream!

be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	For a stir fry, cube it to whatever size you like. The next step depends on how cooked you like your tofu. I prefer it to be golden and a bit crispy on the outside so I fry it in a skillet with a bit of oil. Stir/flip after about three minutes. Stir/flip again after another couple minutes or so. Once it is golden, about 8 - 10 minutes total, take it out of the pan and then cook the veggies. Add the cooked tofu to the veggies during the last couple minutes of cooking to reheat it and coat it with any sauce you may be using.    If you prefer tofu that isn't crispy and is simply warmed and almost poached, stir fry the veggies and then add the cubed tofu during the last 4 minutes of cooking.    You can cut the tofu into slices for "steaks" or even for stir-fry if you prefer (though the pieces aren't as easy to work with as cubes.    I use the extra-firm for almost all cooking. Usually it is found in the produce section of the grocery store but if yours has an organic/natural foods section with a refrigerator case it could be there.    Here's one of my fave tofu recipes. http://find.myrecipes.com/recipes/recipe...|`|kT8rhVdLaa	dust the tofu in cornstarch and fry it, then add it to pineapple fried rice, yum|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	check this out =]    http://www.savvyvegetarian.com/vegetaria...|`|b9wICW1Paa	One of my favorite uses is a tofu, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.  Slice tofu into pieces that will fit into a sanwich (1/4" or more, thinner you slice more likely it is to become crispy), then fry in your choice of oil (olive is good, coconut might be tasty, too).  Serve on whole grain (sprouted bread is great) with leaf lettuce or other hearty variety, sliced tomato, mayonaise, and mustard - omit the mayo if vegan.  You can salt and pepper the tofu if you wish, but it's not necessary.  Serve with pickle on the side, maybe coleslaw or potato chips (indulgence) if you wish, and you have a fine lunch.|`|ODZeyNYMaa	I cut mine into strips, then bake it in the oven for 20 mins at 450 degrees. It is so much easier to stir fry with when it becomes firm after baking. I spray the bottom of the baking pan with pam, so it doesn't stick, and you can bake it with teriaki sauce, hoisen sauce or soy sauce on it. You can even marinate it for a while (10-20 mins) before you cook it to absorb more flavor.   Hope this helped! Good Luck!  Oh, and I would  buy the extra firm or firm to stir fry with, especially if you want it to stay in strips. If you don't mind it crumbling, you can use a less firm tofu, but the soft is good for desserts, substitutes in baking, etc.
pUpZevtzaa	Yes, its safe.  Apparently green or sprouting potatoes contain some chemical that can be toxic...but soft potatoes are ok in soup.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	soft potatoes as in limp but not soft as in mushy, right?  Limp is okay, that just means they have lost some of the moisture that is naturally in them.  No worries.  Mushy ones stink so you would not have any thoughts of using them.    Slice one of the limp ones and drop into cold wtaer, bet it crisps right up, same as limp carrot or celery.

Butter two 9-inch cake pans, then line the bottoms with rounds of parchment or wax paper. Preheat the oven to 350°.<br>  <br>  2. Melt both chocolates together with the 6 tablespoons of water. Use either a double-boiler or a microwave. Stir until smooth, then set aside until room temperature.<br>  <br>  3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, or by hand, beat the butter and 1 ? cup of the sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the melted chocolate, then the egg yolks, one at a time.<br>  <br>  4. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.<br>  <br>  5. Mix in half of the dry ingredients into the creamed butter mixture, then the buttermilk and the vanilla extract, then the rest of the dry ingredients.<br>  <br>  6. In a separate metal or glass bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold soft, droopy peaks. Beat in the ? cup of sugar until stiff.<br>  <br>  7. Fold about one-third of the egg whites into the cake batter to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites just until there's no trace of egg white visible.<br>  <br>  8. Divide the batter into the 2 prepared cake pans, smooth the tops, and bake for about 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br>  <br>  Cool cake layers completely.<br>  <br>  While the cakes are baking and cooling, make the filling, syrup, and icing.<br>  <br>  <br>  To make the filling:<br>  <br>  1. Mix the cream, sugar, and egg yolks in a medium saucepan. Put the 3 ounces butter, salt, toasted coconut, and pecan pieces in a large bowl.<br>  <br>  2. Heat the cream mixture and cook, stirring constantly (scraping the bottom as you stir) until the mixture begins to thicken and coats the spoon (an instant-read thermometer will read 170°.)<br>  <br>  3. Pour the hot custard immediately into the pecan-coconut mixture and stir until the butter is melted. Cool completely to room temperature. (It will thicken.)<br>  <br>  <br>  To make the syrup:<br>  <br>  1. In a small saucepan, heat the sugar and water until the sugar has melted. Remove from heat and stir in the dark rum.<br>  <br>  <br>  To make the icing:<br>  <br>  1. Place the 8 ounces of chopped chocolate in a bowl with the corn syrup and 1 ? ounces of butter.<br>  <br>  2. Heat the cream until it just begins to boil. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate. Let stand one minute, then stir until smooth. Let sit until room temperature.<br>  <br>  <br>  To assemble the cake:<br>  <br>  Remove the cake layers from the pans and cut both cake layers in half horizontally, using a serrated bread knife.<br>  Set the first cake layer on a cake plate. Brush well with syrup. Spread ? cup of the coconut filling over the cake layer, making sure to reach to the edges. Set another cake layer on top.<br>  <br>  Repeat, using the syrup to brush each cake layer, then spreading ? cup of the coconut filling over each layer, including the top.<br>  <br>  Ice the sides with the chocolate icing, then pipe a decorative border of chocolate icing around the top, encircling the coconut topping.<br>  <br>  (It may seem like a lot of chocolate icing, but use it all. Trust me. You won't be sorry.)|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Honestly, the best pain-free German chocolate cake I've made was by buying the mix at the store!<br>  I think it is Duncan-Hines who makes the best frosting for it.<br>  I baked a two layer cake with tons of the caramel/coconut frosting and it came out rich and moist!

Below the ribs cut through that and separate the back from the breast.  With the tip of the knife cut between the breasts and then ease the knife through the soft bone between the breast and separate the halves.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	How do you want it cut? that would change the answer. If you just want to clean it, get chicken breast and clean up the white on it, by just slicing a knife in the clear membrane. If you are looking for chunks of chix to make kabobs, then cut in cubes and cut off fat. Good luck

JGRMA4KPaa	GracieM is right, but i think if you are able to serve in the military...you should be able to drink!|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Because 18 year olds in the U.S. aren't as mature as we would like.  Even 21 is a questionable age sometimes.|`|xwG6e7IQaa	The only reason alcohol is illegal till you are 21 is because it's another thing for the governemtn to control...back in prohibition...|`|AA11927261	I hope I get all my facts right, forgive me if I get a little of this wrong.  OK in 1980 (or close to that) Congress wanted to raise the limit (I'm not sure of the reasoning) and the states wanted money for the interstate system.  So in order to get the money the states all had to agree to the age limit.  Before that it was up to each state to set the limit, so if you were underage in say Georgia, you could drive to Alabama and get your drink on. I agree that it should be the same in every state and while I know that most 21 year ODs are still for the most stupid kids it seems wrong that you can send that same kid off to die in a war he can't have a beer.    I personally allow my boys to have a little of my wine, beer or what ever I'm having.  They have learned what they like, what they don't and I hope I have taken away the "coolness" of drinking so they will not be so tempted to be stupid with it.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	I don't know.       Hey you live in Ireland eh? Ship me some fresh Guinness would ya mate?|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Because a lobbying group (MADD) used bad science to get the Feds to blackmail the state governments into making it that way.|`|yXsFze93aa	One opinion is the fact that in 1984, the US Congress implemented the  National Minimum Drinking Age Act requiring all states to raise their minimum purchase and public possession of alcohol age to 21. States that did not comply faced a 10% reduction in highway funds under the Federal Highway Aid Act.    Also, as previously stated, most 18 year olds are not mature enough to handle the responsibility. On the other hand, I know 50 year old people who suffer the same lack of responsibility!
llkSmgLJaa	Yes, like all animals the baby calf needs B12 for proper development. Human milk is high in B12 too.|`|MpzPfzivaa	Yes, just not in skim milk, yogurt, or cooked dairy. You can also get it in eggs.|`|d2846213b87d5246da81ceaa4bf3219baa	Well not in the dairy we find in the stores, because it is all pasteurized/ homogenized, which depletes it of any nutrients. Then they add synthetic vitamins in to make up for it, but I don't think its as easily absorbable by the body as the vitamins in real raw dairy.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	B12 comes from microorganisms -- bacteria--  and no place else in nature.   It ends up in flesh and other animal products like dairy and eggs because animals digest it from bacteria which are making it in their guts, or  they have consumed it.    Because with plants, it would be on the plant-- not in it,    we can't say that there is a reliable source of B12 from any plant.   With modern agriculture and the treatment of water, it's even more difficult.  So vegans (those who do not use eggs or milk)  should take a small supplement of vitamin B12, or eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 daily  to avoid health problems later down the road.        Eggs and dairy products do contain a small amount of  B12,  and probably just enough.  But I think it's smart for a vegetarian to also take a small vitamin B12 supplement or eat foods fortified with B12.     Also, even for meat eaters,  after age 50,  it's probably a good idea to take a vitamin B12 because our bodies go through changes as we age that in many cases make it more difficult to digest vitamin B12 from foods.    Ask your doctor.  There are more people deficient in vitamin B12 who are not vegetarian or vegan for that and other reasons.
snBeIxpBaa	Ok, lets clear up a few things.   <br>  <br>  1)  What you see in those videos (stomping on necks, lifting cows with fork lifts, forcing water down their throats with hoses and the mass majority of employee abuse on animals.)  IS ILLEGAL!  Meaning they are breaking the law, it goes against the Humane Slaughter Act.    NOT ALL ESTABLISHMENTS ARE THIS WAY!  (That's like saying what happens in every high school is based on what tv shows/movies show us.)<br>  <br>  2)  Cows are commonly stunned (knocked unconcious) by a pneumatic bolt gun, they are hung from their legs to hasten the rate at which blood drains out.  (gravity at work for a more humane method)<br>  <br>  3)  Pigs are essentially the same way, only instead of a bolt gun, they use electricity.  <br>  <br>  4)  Poultry on the other hand, is changing how they are killed.  Instead of the current electrocution / bleedingmethod used, they will likely be gassed then hung/drained and so on.   ((NOTE:  The gas is CO2, AKA Carbon Dioxide... so it is perfectly safe and does not affect the quality of the bird).<br>  <br>  <br>  From the way it sounds, you want things to go back to how they were 100 yrs ago, smaller farms..more local farming and so on.  I'm sad to say, that this will likely never happen, due to land requirements, the amount of animals raised and other various factors.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	I support slaughterhouse abuse.|`|JK2RvliYaa	It takes a weak person to abuse an animal.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	I think it's horrible. I too cry when I see it (or even think about it)!<br>  <br>  I cannot imagine the fear and pain those animals go through. And what's the most horrible part is they don't have a voice and cannot tell people to stop. <br>  <br>  I shudder to think about the types of people who are so insensitive that they can do that type of work for years on end.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	i am sure you are talking about ALL meat products...cows..pigs..chickens..do you eat eggs from chickens that never see a pasture...how about lamb chops...lets not forget about the millions of fish that are caught in nets...and the lobsters that are cooked while still alive..and did you swee the report that vegetables arent as good for you as they were 50 yrs ago..|`|b9uOax0aaa	This appears to be a solicitation for donations.  Against TOS.|`|u93oneUXaa	Okay - the person above me likes to believe ridiculous things don't happen. It may be illegal but it still happens! The Humane Slaughter Act is a JOKE! Research it some more before defending it - research the animals it doesn't apply to as well! And yes, cows are stunned, but this is done at such a high speed that it is done incorrectly most of the time and they are still concious! And saying that CO2 is safe in chickens? HAHAHA I don't even know where to begin with that statement.. For some reason I want to believe people are more educated than this.|`|nYGHyyZUaa	Well, I agree that the abuse some animals get is a bit harsh, but the if you're talking about why they have to die? It's because people will always eat meat. Maybe not everyone, but most people will.  I HAVE seen some reports about how the animals are abused BEFORE they are dead.. This i do not agree with...<br>  I don't think anyone really does.<br>  Not many people know about this though, and I believe that animals should not be killed in inhumane ways.|`|I7rQuaPYaa	its life i just eat my meat and get on with my life<br>  <br>  those vids with blood splatter coming from animals r all just exageration from that retard organization peta and those r only a small amount of very cruel slaugterhouses even i dont like<br>  <br>  go ask a lion or tiger why they eat meat, im sure theyll devour u instead of reasoning|`|mPgydPKGaa	its absolutely terrible and unnatural. meat eaters don't even realize what they are eating and how it got on their plate. they only care about feeding themselves and satisfying their hunger. disgusting.

AA12185092	Alcoholics are people who can't control their drinking. He' s counting the days he's been sober because alcohol has already made a mess of his life once. Can someone like that learn to be a social drinker? Maybe, but many have tried and failed. Weighing the risks against the benefits, it's a no-brainer to abstain completely.|`|HPn75mp8aa	Point is he's an alcoholic and can't control his drinking. While you can have one or two, catch a buzz and stop drinking he can't. When he drinks, he's out of control, One drink becomes two, two drinks become three, three drinks leads to tequila shots and tequila shots usually don't lead anywhere good.<br>  <br>  He's got a problem and his way of dealing with it is simply not to drink alcohol.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	I take it we are talking about some one who used to be an alcoholic. If u are addicted to alcohol and manage to give it up, it only takes one drink to put u right back where u started. that is why they can never drink again, as they would just end up as alcoholics again.|`|qp62VijHaa	When you are an alcoholic or have a problem controlling alcohol consumption, it is NEVER  just one drink.

It's an estimate, but especially for milk it depends on the factors of your refrigerator and how it was stored in the store.<br>  <br>  If it still tastes and smells good, it's fine.  If it smells sour or tastes bad or is chunky, it's bad.  That's how you tell - not by the expiry date.  You use the expiry date when you buy it to estimate whether you will be able to drink all of that milk by that time, because that estimates when it will go bad.  It doesn't mean the milk is bad after that date.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Considering it didn't decide to spoil as soon as it checked the calendar, you're probably okay.|`|ixOE0onnaa	you might get sick a few days later did you drink it if so it might hurt you and please dont you might also die. the other thing is to give it to the birds. they might drink it.|`|AA10625089	Just because the expiration date was yesterday doesn't mean that it's bad.

Stir in garlic and wine, cook 1 minute. Place steaks in pan, cook for 5 - 10 minutes each side, depending on thickness and preferred doneness.<br>  <br>  Reduce temperature to low and pour brandy onto steaks, carefully light match to brandy -- be careful because this will flame. If exhaust fan is low to stove, remove skillet before lighting. Let flames burn out.<br>  <br>  Circle steaks with cream. Cook over low heat, letting cream heat with sauce.

It is so simple, but SO GOOD -- very rich.<br>  <br>  Best served with shoestring french fries and salad.|`|53giV6PFaa	This is how I cook my steaks:<br>  <br>  Let it sit 30 minutes before you cook it on the counter to get the "chill" out of the meat. Salt and pepper both sides - no need for a marinade on a good cut of meat IMO.<br>  <br>  Fry about 4 minutes on each side to get a nice medium rare over medium high heat and a little olive oil. Add a few more minutes for how you like it. Don't cut the steak while cooking to see how it is cooked. I never have used a thermometer either. I just gently poke the steak without piercing it to see how it feels. Medium rare should feel like the fleshy part of your palm by your thumb. The firmer the meat feels the more its cooked.<br>  <br>  Put a slice of garlic-herb butter on top and let it melt. It does add a nice flavor that compliments the steak.<br>  <br>  Here is how you make the butter:<br>  <br>  8 tbsp. butter, softened<br>  1 tsp. garlic, minced<br>  2 tbsp. fresh parsley, finely chopped<br>  1 tbsp. green onion, finely chopped<br>  Salt<br>  Pepper<br>  <br>  Make sure your butter is very soft, so leave out for a few hours at room temperature. Do not microwave - you don't want melted butter just softened. Mix with all the ingredients. Put the mixture on a sheet of parchment paper, roll into a log, then freeze<br>  <br>  Let sit for 10 minutes before you serve so the juices can redistribute.|`|a4661a0c616a32ff5dd3a5301254d3d5aa	Ingredients:<br>  1 teaspoon crushed hot red chilies<br>  1/4 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds<br>  1/4 teaspoon ground cumin<br>  1 dried bay leaf, crumbled into tiny pieces<br>  1/4 teaspoon crushed coriander seeds<br>  1/4 cayenne pepper<br>  3/4 teaspoon salt<br>  1 teaspoon vegetable oil<br>  2 porterhouse steaks (18-20 oz. size), each about 1" thick<br>  <br>  <br>  Turn this recipe into a puzzle!

And the color scheme of the label is black and red...  Not that it matters, but just saying...    Menage a Trois - not only a provocative name, but their red blend is great for the money.

v4vQSzu4aa	Well then, happy Birthday to your son!!!!!  If he is older and if this is your only protein, I would say not. I'm sure the kids won't eat as much (if they are younger)  but if you have time, I would add another quick protein because cooking some more Boston Butt is not a quick option.  Possibly make some fillers such as pasta/potato salad, coleslaw, cornbread, Mac and Cheese Casserole,  a big bowl of salad, or maybe some appetizers to ease their appetites a bit.  So, I hope this helps you out to have enough food for the big party, have fun and have a great time!|`|HZvdr8VLaa	I would recommend making some wonderful baked beans.. I take regular pork and beans, add some ketchup, brown sugar and a little molasses..just play with the flavor, they are great.  Then make {or purchase} some potato salad and cole slaw.   This will work as fillers and people won't eat near as much meat.  The good thing is if there are 'left overs'  they will be great for future lunch's or snacks.

4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	Here are several suggestions - I've had all of them with Steak, so I do know first hand...    There are two wines great with Steak, that people tend to overlook:  The first is Zinfandel (especially "Old Vines" style).  Here are three - all under $20:  R&B  Pedroncelli  Bogle    The other one is Malbec, which is awesome with Steak:  Viu Manent  Don Rodolfo  Bodega  Burton  Gascon    For Merlot:  Beaucanon  Francisan  Rodney Strong    For Cabernet Sauvignon:  Robert Mondavi  Lockwood  McManis  Geyser Peak      For a great red blend:  Magito - it's from Sebastopol, CA - YUM!    Pinot Noir - usually too light for steak, but these two hold up nicely:  Cristom - about $25 to $30  Estancia - about $13 to $16|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	carlo rossi burgundy! :D|`|vcgn6XZgaa	A Bordeaux or Beaujolais would go well.  Only red wine with steak,not white or Rose!|`|qhKP68eiaa	Stick with red's.  A great, lower budget red that I've found is Kim Crawford Merlot.  Anything really in the Kim Crawford has been outstanding!  The site listed below does refer to some Australian and other wines from that area of the globe.  Be creative and adventurous, but also mind reviews.|`|04w6ur39aa	Merlot is a little soft. I would go for a Chilean cabernet or carmeniere. Great value and good body|`|0xdKGMX7aa	Going are the days when you absolutely need to pair a wine with your food. However, in France they would pair it with a dry red:     Merlots are good, so too would be Bordeaux or Cabernet Sauvignon     In the north of Italy they would choose:   Piemonte like Barbaresco or from Tuscany a Chianti    Years ago my friend and I would drink what ever was red and cheap! :)
54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	As they've already said, botanically it is a fruit because it is the seed bearing ovary of a plant. But, legal, it is a vegetable. The United States Supreme Court declared it a vegetable for commerce purposes back in the 1930's.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Scientifically a fruit but for culinary purposes it is a vegetable. So I guess it's both.|`|9ilXVowLaa	fruity toot toot<br>  <br>  peace and love|`|1cYPOJkqaa	It is in the fruit section of the vegetable family.|`|dh1LrDO7aa	It's considered a fruit in science, but it seems like a vegetable to me!|`|wy54YPuQaa	Fruit|`|sw2R5A9iaa	fruit|`|TCCgtrrJaa	To really figure out if a tomato is a fruit or vegetable, you need to know what makes a fruit a fruit, and a vegetable a vegetable. The big question to ask is, DOES IT HAVE SEEDS? If the answer is yes, then technically, you have a FRUIT. This, of course, makes your tomato a fruit. It also makes cucumbers, squash, green beans and walnuts all fruits as well. VEGETABLES such as, radishes, celery, carrots, and lettuce do NOT have seeds (that are part of what we eat) and so they are grouped as vegetables. Now don't go looking for tomatoes next to the oranges in your grocery stores; fruits like tomatoes and green beans are usually (alas, incorrectly) referred to as "vegetables" in most grocery stores and cookbooks.|`|JTy58mFbaa	in my science book it says scientifically it is a fruit. True fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower, and contain the seeds of the plant. As far as cooking is concerned, some things which are strictly fruits may be called 'vegetables' because they are used in savoury rather than sweet cooking. The tomato, though technically a fruit, is often used as a vegetable, and a bean pod is also technically a fruit. The term 'vegetable' is more generally used of other edible parts of plants, such as cabbage leaves, celery stalks, and potato tubers, which are not strictly the fruit of the plant from which they come. Occasionally the term 'fruit' may be used to refer to a part of a plant which is not a fruit, but which is used in sweet cooking: rhubarb, for example. So a tomato is the fruit of the tomato plant, but can be used as a vegetable in cooking.|`|Y1npBMS0aa	i love you for asking this question!<br>  <br>  its a fruit. even ask google:)<br>  BUT in my heart it will always be a vegetable:)|`|iF2MJP98aa	Fruit, scientific evidence has already proven this.|`|I7rQuaPYaa	its a fruigitable that is non ediblee not eat it poisionous|`|6fc23a10b26247d3876292d9d5ae3361aa	veggie baby|`|1vKY3Usaaa	FRUIT!|`|LclLMqU4aa	Its A Fruit If It Has Seeds Its A Fruit.|`|fPZPsGv1aa	FRUIT DEF.<br>  <br>  REMEMBER ANYTHING WITH SEEDS IS A FRUIT!|`|py3Lvxmtaa	its a fruit

Some people believe the two counteract each other, but all you really get is a wide awake drunk.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	it's not bad, it tastes great!|`|BTtvG2r8aa	K-vodka  It's not bad, the only problem is that because of the caffeine in the energy drink you will be more alert when drunk and may continue to keep drinking when normally you would stop.  Eventually you will pass out or throw up or both.  But this only happens if you are retarded and don't drink responsibly...or not an alcoholic ;)|`|zhk8o514aa	..first time hearing this.|`|DTBbQbfLaa	WTF?  That is the BEST!

I prefer orange vodka and redbull though...|`|agTCqkLDaa	Because you're supposed to mix vodKa with redbull :)|`|MzWiGnqdaa	I see no issues with that concoction.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Because vodka is a downer and red bull is an upper (more or less).

I remember people joking that the Red Bull is to "keep you up late," while the vodka makes you not remember any of it.|`|02Rrrz47aa	who told you this?!|`|yxNPmoviaa	VERY bad. Alcohol is a depressant. Redbull is a stimulant. Your heart is battling two very different rhythms, which is rather unhealthy..|`|EKCv5oDGaa	If you are drinking either one of those drinks then you must not care about your health, so why bother wondering if mixing them will hurt you?    But, yes- redbull is a stimulant (heart rate up) and alcohol is a depressant ( heart rate down) so mixing them can potentially cause problems.

8lYZROjuaa	Very good for you.<br>  <br>  Potatoes have about 620 mg of potassium-that's more than a banana. Potassium is essential to the body because of its role in attaining optimal muscle performance and improving the nerves' response to stimulation. Iron, essential in helping the body convert food to energy as well as resist infection, is also present. <br>  <br>  One would expect potatoes to have minerals, as they spend their life underground. But potatoes are also a great source of vitamins, even supplying vitamin C, the sunshine vitamin. Vitamin C is essential to help maintain healthy connective tissue and heal wounds. The many varieties of Washington potatoes are also good sources of B vitamins, helping the body make healthy red blood cells and amino acids. <br>  <br>  Potatoes contain no fat or cholesterol and minimal sodium. What they do have is natural fiber in the skins, all those vitamins and minerals and great flavor. And a six-ounce potato contains 2 grams of highly digestible protein, almost as much as half a glass of milk, making it a great foundation for a whole meal. <br>  <br>  One of the most popular nutritional myths today concerns the dietary evils of carbohydrates. Despite the media hype, scientific evidence indicates that when consumed in normal amounts... <br>  <br>  Carbohydrates DO NOT cause weight gain and obesity <br>  Carbohydrates DO NOT automatically cause blood sugar "spikes" and insulin "surges" <br>  Carbohydrates DO NOT cause diabetes, heart disease or cancer. <br>  Carbohydrates are the body's primary fuel source. Muscles prefer them and the brain relies on them. In fact, carbohydrates are so crucial to the body that if you severely cut them from your diet, your body will begin to breakdown muscle and other protein-containing tissues-your heart and other vital organs-in order to make them. <br>  <br>  3 grams of protein<br>  45% daily value for vitamin Ctrace amounts of thiamin, riboflavin, folate, magnesium, phosphorous, iron and zinc <br>  all for only 110 calories and no fat.|`|EUnx6Ncoaa	yes, but they are starchy and have carbohydrates, supposedly the super healthy part is the skins. nutrients and such are there mostly as long as you super scrub them, they should be okay.|`|AEgBRyspaa	yes but eat them before 5 pm... watch this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8edIPGXKTk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8edIPGXK...</a>|`|x3RAaLfNaa	Yes, if they have absolutely nothing on them they are only like 90-120 calories.|`|l6y0Ec57aa	They are healthy and a good source of carbs.  It's all the stuff people put on them that makes them fattening.|`|A5D62Ycbaa	Healthy - yes, but not the most interesting!|`|OBW7N4KKaa	yes very|`|ZTZBItU0aa	yes|`|HUvPNQYIaa	define healthy. <br>  <br>  it would be high in carbs for sure...i mean after all it is a potato. <br>  <br>  it really just depends on what you are looking for. i can't imagine that tasting very good tho!<br>  <br>  it might be better to dice them up and put them in the oven and try to bake them like old fashioned potato chips. <br>  <br>  Spray two baking sheets lightly with some nonfat cooking oil. Cut potatoes 1/8-inch thick and arrange them in one layer on the baking sheets. Spray slices lightly with the nonfat cooking oil and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25-30 minutes or until they are golden throughout. (They will brown at different rates.) Transfer them to paper towels and sprinkle them with salt and rosemary, if desired, while they are still hot. <br>  <br>  Same ingredient...but it'll taste much better!!!! Enjoy.|`|uxuAgrtJaa	yep! only absolutely plain though.<br>  no sour cream, butter, cheese or nothing.<br>  <br>  but if you don't like them plain, the healthiest choice is a little bit of pepper and cottage cheese.|`|tr24a9Gcaa	That sounds like a pretty healthy choice, but watch the toppings like sour cream and cheese and other thins that could potentially make it unhealthy!|`|dbc568f53c9b599c32bf496c80476c39aa	Baked potatoes are healthy for you, try them with salsa on top, Yummy.|`|F5YAwC7Aaa	yes very much so potatoes are healthy to begin with|`|F43Vzpbbaa	yes they are. you should eat at least 1 lb of potato per day.|`|79da6072a6fc28aa8f741f04b454ce78aa	yes they are.  Thats without alot of butter, sour cream and chesse.|`|8CC3wEW4aa	YES|`|I6dcRgD6aa	depending on what you are comparing them too. They are better than fried yet not as much fiber in them as sweet potatoes. They are real food so better than a lot of junk you can eat.|`|5E4t2xqNaa	Sure, if you're not on a low-carb diet.|`|pNxuvKUOaa	Not bad, but they're starchy and have carbs. Just don't load them up with cheese, sour cream or butter- a little is enough. Plain baked sweet potatoes are a bit better for you.|`|9Qi7L1WWaa	not really i mean they are a vegitable but they are like the unhealthiest kind of vegitable as long as they are plain they are okay better than pizza or cheesburgers!|`|bd163219e3e28f81a684e8a64f8c8f5caa	Yes, they are healthy but a little bit boring too.|`|h5cPbPj5aa	Yes

9Gnm4PbNaa	I have been a vegetarian for 9 years last month. It is true that you should watch your weight and general intake at first. It is easy to eat more carbs to substitute. <br>  <br>  Health wise, a vegetarian diet is extremely heart healthy. Most vegetarians have very low cholesterol. The digestive track is also much healthier. It is documented that individuals who maintain a vegetarian diet are at a much lower risk for certain cancers, including colon cancer. When I became a vegetarian, my skin cleared up and I had more energy within the first week. <br>  <br>  However, there are some health precautions that you need to take. Study about a complete vegetarian diet before you begin. Learn about completing proteins and good vitamin intake. A good daily multivitamin is recommended.  It is not uncommon for a vegetarian to be anemic, though this can generally be avoided by eating leafy greens and dried fruits.<br>  <br>  The only problem that I have had in my 9 years was diagnosed last December. I have very low B12 and as a result, I am now taking monthly B12 injections. B12 is generally found only in foods such as fish, shellfish, meat, and dairy products. So, it may be something to monitor if you stay a vegetarian for several years.|`|JJNNpxvuaa	1. Lower risk of lung and colorectal cancer.<br>  <br>  2. Prevention of Type 2 diabetes.<br>  <br>  3.

ml0r6iOiaa	You are 13 and it is illegal to make wine at your age.|`|MqCuDV4Naa	The balloon is full of yeast farts.|`|TDUcM2Bvaa	search google for homemade wine recipes. there are TONS of them and they are all pretty simple but they all require boiling the water which it doesn't sound like you did. goodluck
54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Ok first you used waaaay too much yeast. For a half gallon of juice you only need about 1/8 of a teaspoon of yeast. You should go checkout some videos on youtube. There are a lot of wine making videos there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN8QL3qOOgw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN8QL3qOO...</a>|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Where did you get those instructions? They should be able to tell you what the next step should be.<br>  <br>  I've never done what you're doing so I really couldn't say.|`|lLPIs7WFaa	oh yeah, you have a sort of hard cider/low wine.  Drain it through a filter, add a few spoonfuls of sugar and put on a new balloon.  When it blows up agian take off the balloon, filter it and drink it.  It should taste much like a horse with kidney trouble that fed on grapes peed in your jar.  It is alcohol.  It just tastes really nasty.  Mine did.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I've used a very similar recipe to make homeade wine.  Well, I used frozen grape juice concentrate, active dry yeast, sugar, and water.  But it did the balloon thing.  You have to wait until it inflates and deflates on it's own.  It is done when the balloon is fully deflated. Do not deflate it yourself.  It is a very, very slow process. I started mine in November of 2007 and it is still in the process of deflating.  However, I also made a huge batch and put it in a juice jug... that one was done in a few days but tastes absolutely horrible. Like everclear soaked bread.|`|ib7gsy4Naa	I assume you used a package of baker’s yeast… In order to make “drinkable” hooch a person should use brewer’s yeast… I could go on for hours trying to explain the differences but you have the internet right? Yeast is just a general name like vehicle is to corvette. Definitely dump that stuff out and buy a strand of brewer’s yeast if you want to make a quality cider… a Google search will yield plenty of online stores. What you are making is similar to the stuff they make in prison called “pruno” which is known to cause blindness and severe liver damage.|`|kmIcAySEaa	I thought you were supposed to use sugar too, was it sweetened juice ? I imagine you can google how to make wine and find out.

Add vanilla and powdered sugar. Whisk together until creamy, adding milk to achieve desired consistency. Spread over warm Triple Chocolate Brownies.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Use the semisweet instead of the Hershey.<br>  <br>  Make your own powdered sugar by putting regular sugar in your food processor and grind it into a fine powder.

Store leftovers in air-tight containers.|`|XcNoptFbaa	Never-fail Fudge Frosting<br>  <br>  1/2 cup salted butter<br>  1 cup white sugar<br>  1/3 cup cream<br>  1/2 cup chocolate chips<br>  1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>  1/2 cup chopped pecans (optional)<br>  <br>  Place butter, sugar and cream into a medium size saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly. Turn down the heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes. Add the half cup chocolate chips, stir them in and remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the vanilla and the pecans if you decided to use them.<br>  <br>  Pour the frosting on the cake and spread it out quickly with<br>  a spatula. If you're pouring it on a warm cake or a cold cake, just grab the pan and tip it so the frosting covers the whole top. If you want this frosting to cool in a big hurry just slip it in the refrigerator uncovered for a half hour or so.|`|bwQaIGpZaa	Melt your chocolate chips and thin them with some heavy cream... yes milk will do, but cream is better.

I hope your frosting turns out great! :-)|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Chocolate Ganache<br>  <br>  1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br>  2/3 cup heavy whipping cream<br>  Directions:<br>  1.  In a heavy saucepan, melt chocolate chips with cream over low heat. Remove from the heat. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally.<br>  2.  For a pourable ganache, cool until mixture reaches 85 degrees F-90 degrees F and is slightly thickened, about 40 minutes. Pour over cake, allowing some to flow down the edges to completely coat. Spread ganache with a spatula if necessary to evenly coat, working quickly before it thickens. Chill until set.<br>  3.  For spreadable ganache, chill until mixture reaches a spreadable consistency.

Cj4i2pbTaa	Here are some ways to "upgrade" what you are currently eating...<br>  Currently:                                        New:<br>  white bread --                                  wheat or whole grain bread<br>  1%, 2%, or whole Milk --                  Skim<br>  Those are just two basics.  You can always buy the food item that says "low fat" or even "no fat" on it.  When you go to the grocery store, be looking out for those healthier choices.<br>  Good, healthy snacks would be yogurt, fruit, vegetables with ranch dressing, or granola bars.<br>  Be sure to eat from all of the main food groups: <br>  -Milk, cheese, and yogurt (3 servings)<br>  -Vegetables (3 servings)<br>  -Bread, rice, and pasta (6 servings)<br>  Fruit (2 servings)<br>  -Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, and nuts (2 servings)|`|a4661a0c616a32ff5dd3a5301254d3d5aa	oatmeal<br>  tebboulah salad<br>  yogurt<br>  hummus(u can make ur own, just puree chickpeas with herbs, lemon, garlic or an other veggies you like yum)<br>  pita bread<br>  fruits <br>  vegetables<br>  add seltzer water to fruit juice to make your own 'soda'<br>  cut out dairy<br>  use soy products<br>  lettuce wraps are simple to make and delish|`|AA10413990	Besides sticking to natural fruits and vegetables, I'd suggest heading to a health food store for trail mixes and natural almonds for snacking.

Its headquarters are in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a town permeated by the aroma of cocoa on some days, and home to Hershey's Chocolate World. It was founded by Milton S. Hershey in 1894 as the Hershey Chocolate Company, a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. Hershey's candies and other products are sold worldwide.<br>  <br>  Hershey's is one of the oldest chocolate companies in the United States, and an American icon for its chocolate bar.

It is copper with an aluminum core.  When heated too hot the aluminum will burst into flame even though it has copper on the outside of it.  The copper is just for visual appeal.  When purchasing a pan read the documentation that comes with it.  If it is clad it will have an aluminum core.  If it say copper bottom then it will be a true copper disk on the bottom of the pan.<br>  <br>  Personally I would never use a copper clad pan to heat oil.

It may clean your pan but extended use will cause permanent damage. Recommended Cleaning: PadDobie? pad <br>  <br>  For generalized "Bluing" of your stainless steel interior, bring two tablespoons of generic white vinegar and 2 cups of water to a boil, and the blue "film" should disappear. <br>  <br>  Do not use oven cleaners or cleansers with chlorine bleach. <br>  <br>  DO NOT USE Abrasive cleansers or cleaning pads, oven cleaners or other caustic cleaning solutions, baking soda, automatic dishwasher detergent, liquid bleach, liquid household cleaners used for floors, porcelain, etc. <br>  <br>  Always allow your pan to cool before washing.

Then they come out nice and flexible and still taste good.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Most will crumble unless you fry them in a bit of oil or butter before wrapping something in them.   If you know how to make homemade corn torts, then they will be nice and pliable straight from the griddle.<br>  <br>  Well, I'm thinking that perhaps there should be a section in foods and drinks that are totally fat free!  Some ppl are so afraid to add a little butter or oil to their diet.  What is with that?  <br>  I KNOW that you have to soften your corn tortillas in oil or butter in order for them not to crumble on you.  Water or any liquid of the sort only makes them crumble even  more.  Keep knocking me down for good answers.....  Might want to actually try things first.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	you have to warm them up first, its a little difficult to make a wrap anyways. there is no gluten in them.the good corn tortillas are just lime, corn and water.|`|MOx1A63Eaa	Before you use the store corn tortillas wet them and them heat them at the microwave.

XzLUA7ataa	The standard procedure is to cook them as soon as the boat brings them in to preserve the freshness.  You can tell by the red coloring that they've been cooked and it probably doesn't specify on the package since they aren't sold uncooked.  All are precooked.|`|53giV6PFaa	I believe packaging in the U.S. are suppose to clarify fully cooked versus raw.  It just maybe really small print.

Trust me it works and besides its just several dollars so whats it gonna hurt if you try it even if you don't believe me.|`|qyObFvz6aa	The best thing to do is try not getting a hangover. If you know you're going to get drunk that night, drink alot of water throughout the day. Eat a light but satisfying meal like two hours before. Get drunk. <br>  <br>  But you asked for a cure. So after you are drunk, when you want to go to sleep and the whole room starts spinning, that means you need to get up and do something. Dance, jump up and down, have sex, drink more water, whatever. If you do not, when you wake up you will feel really fckd up. Once the room stops spinning, its ok to sleep. <br>  <br>  When you get up go to McDonald's and order a #1. If they are not serving breakfast, that means you should still be sleeping. If you are still too drunk to drive or cannot fathom crawling out of your bed, order some pasta with a heavy cream sauce from your nearest pizzeria. If you have no cash left over because you squandered it all on alcohol, then you have to beg, borrow, or steal from your roommate (or if you live at home still, your siblings). After you've eaten, you should have enough energy to shower. And then you should be somewhat functional. Continue drinking water.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	Menudo.

F2ugW4cRaa	Irish Plumb Pudding.<br>  Grated rind and juice of 1 lemon <br>  Grated rind and juice of 1 orange <br>  I large apple, grated finely <br>  1 cups sultanas <br>  1 cups raisins <br>  1 heaped tablespoon chopped or flaked almonds <br>  1 heaped tablespoon chopped cherries <br>  1 tablespoon chopped mixed peel <br>  ? cup brown sugar <br>  2 teaspoons mixed spice (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg) <br>  3 tablespoons Whiskey <br>  1 cup fresh white breadcrumbs <br>  1 cup self raising flour <br>  2 eggs, beaten together <br>  ? teaspoon salt <br>  4 oz (1 stick) butter <br>  <br>  This is enough to make a pudding in a 1 pint pudding bowl. You will need some waxed or greaseproof paper to cover the pudding, or you can use a pudding bowl with a tight fitting lid. You will need a little additional butter to grease the inside of a pudding bowl before adding the pudding mix.<br>  <br>  Mix together all the ingredients above, down to and including, the whiskey, in a large bowl. Cover and leave for at least 3-4 hours or overnight.<br>  <br>  Stir the breadcrumbs through the fruit mix. Using an electric blender, mix the flour, eggs,salt and butter together. Add to the fruit mix and stir well. If the mixture seems a little dry add a dessertspoon or two of milk.<br>  <br>  Put the mixture into a bowl and cover tightly using the lid or a cover made from several layers of greaseproof or waxed paper held in place with string.<br>  <br>  Place the bowl in a saucepan of water, with the water coming about 2/3rds up the side of the pudding bowl. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a bare simmer. Cover the saucepan with a well fitted lid. Simmer like this for about 6 hours. You will probably need to top the water up now and then - keep an eye on it.<br>  <br>  The cooked pudding will keep for months. When it is needed, steam it again for about 2 hours in the bowl, or turn out of the bowl and reheat in the microwave oven for about 5-10 mins.<br>  <br>  Serve with sherry or brandy sauce or fresh cream.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Irish 7 Course Dinner.  1 Boiled Potato and a 6 Pack.|`|AA11786341	Champ is simplicity itself to make and is the greatest comfort food imaginable - except maybe for its close relative Colcannon<br>  <br>  This is food for a cold winter’s day, a dish to nurse a cold or to mend a broken heart - whatever ails you will not seem so bad when you tuck into a great bowlful of Champ.<br>  <br>  It is also a very good accompaniment for many dishes, especially for any grilled (broiled) meat. <br>  <br>  It’s so simple it barely counts as a recipe!<br>  <br>  If there is any truly traditional Irish dish, this is it. It sounds very ordinary, potato and cabbage, and indeed there is nothing at all complex about making it, but the marriage of floury potatoes, wilted greens and rich butter makes for the ultimate in comfort food.<br>  <br>  It is tasty, filling and easy to make, warming and delicious to eat. Just the thing on a cold winter’s night in front of the fire!<br>  <br>  There are few foods so popular and loved that they have a whole song about them, and Colcannon has a really great song in its praise.<br>  <br>  Traditional Champ Recipe<br>  2 lbs (0.9kg) potatoes, or about 4-6 large potatoes (’old’ potatoes or russet potatoes are best, waxy potatoes won’t do) <br>  ? cup ( 4 fl oz, 125 ml) milk <br>  1 stick (4oz, 120g) butter, divided into two parts <br>  5-6 scallions (green onions), chopped <br>  Salt & Pepper <br>  Fresh Parsley <br>  Yes, I know it is a lot of butter, but you really cannot skimp with champ!<br>  <br>  Method<br>  Peel and boil the potatoes until they are quite soft.<br>  <br>  When the potatoes are done, drain and return the saucepan, with the drained potatoes in, to a low burner, leaving the lid off so that any excess moisture can evaporate. When they are perfectly dry, add the milk to the saucepan along with half the butter and the chopped scallions. Allow the milk to warm but not boil - it is about right when the butter has fully melted into it and it starting to steam.<br>  <br>  With a potato masher or a fork mash the potatoes thoroughly into the butter/milk mixture. Do NOT pass through a ricer or, worse, beat in a mixer as it will make the potatoes gluey and disgusting.<br>  <br>  Mix the scallions thoroughly through the mashed potato. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br>  <br>  Before serving sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley. Most importantly, make a well in the centre of the potato in each serving and put a good pat of butter in it to melt.<br>  <br>  Eat by dipping forkfuls of potato into the melting well of butter. The world will seem a better place|`|b0c119007c39052dc6a078d21860a8e6aa	How about "colcannon?"  It's a yummy mix of potatoes, cabbage, butter, salt, pepper (and onions or leeks) that many Irish pretty much subsisted on throughout the year.  There's even a folk song about it (Mary Black recorded it, so have lots of local Irish bands) that you could play for extra credit.  I don't think anyone in your class will hate it - who hates buttery potato stuff?!?  Good luck.|`|BWxSSADaaa	When I had Irish food (in Ireland), the colcannon was with kale, sometimes cabbage, and the champ was with green onion.  I had very tasty lamb stew, roasted chicken with green peas, potatoes mashed or roasted.  I also, as another person mentioned, had very nice sea food, I think it was salmon in a cream sauce.  Oh, and the breakfasts in Ireland are enormous.  :-D  Even bigger than full English breakfast.<br>  <br>  Half of my family is Irish, but it's Irish-American so I'm not sure if the food tradition is authentic, but my Irish-American grandfather always makes corned beef and cabbage.|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Colcannon rocks. So does champ, which is similar.<br>  <br>  Also Irish lamb stew, boiled bacon and cabbage (the origin of corned beef which was more plentiful in the US), coddle (boiled pork sausages), but also seafood and shellfish from its rocky shores. You don't hear about that as much as immgrants here moved inland, but in Ireland itself it's plentiful - prawns and oysters and salmon. Drinks are mead and Guiness.<br>  <br>  Do a search for some recipes, there are lots of them out there.
