I agree that life is beautiful. It is how you respond to the vicissitudes of life that will determine your perception about it. If it is positive then it is beautiful, if negative, then it is something else. In other words, it is your attitude to the stimulus of the environment and the many changing modes that you encounter every day that could indicate your degree of telling that life is beautiful. If you decide that life is beautiful, then it is beautiful, no matter the present situation. Even in this present economic tumult, you could still say that life is beautiful; it is how you make it be.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.<br>  If you know how to keep happiness in your hand...then life is very beautiful !!!!|`|4uJufzHhaa	NO, life is not beautiful, if you think it is then you're a........

Now Hannah had everything a perfect boyfriend, best friends, being popular, rich parents, a fantastic life. <br>  <br>  This all changed on her sweet 16 birthday. Her boyfriend and her friends were going home after her party and were drinking. They ended up in a horrible accident. Only one of them lived that was her friend Kayla. Kayla soon after went in a coma and never woke up. Kayla's family had to pull the plug they just couldn't afford it any more.<br>  <br>  Hannah didn't have anybody, but her family. She was noticing that her mom and dad have been fighting. About a month later they got a divorce. She would have to go back and fourth and she hated it. <br>  <br>  She missed her old life. She thought multiple times how to kill herself. She never got through to do it. Kids called her a loser and that no one would ever love her any more. Now that put her over the edge she couldn't stand life anymore. She ran into the girls bathroom. Stould there in front of a mirror pulled out a knife from her jacket and slit her wrist. <br>  <br>  A teacher was the one that found poor Hannah. Her parents seemed to have little to care. Now there has been staff and students hearing Hannah crying in the bathroom. It has also been said that students smell the sweet perfume she wore on her sweet 16 birthday.<br>  <br>  Ok well I hope that story helps.

Or that Adam and Ever were a race--we don't know which--and ask them if all the other races aren't meant to exist.<br>  For the not reproducing question mentioned above, I remind them that humanity is on the brink of a population crisis and that the gays are just keeping everything in check. It isn't like we *need* more people, anyways.|`|SZdVYrSSaa	There are a large number of ignorant statements like this one Just keep in mind that these little limericks and rhymes are used by uninvented people who are too simply far too uninformed and face forward in toxic thinking to listen to reason even if you do try to fight them on it. Anymore, I take one of three paths...<br>  <br>  I recently played a cage fighter in a film, and I had to work out 4 hours per day for about 3 months, so I have a fairly commanding presence now, and the last time I heard this exact statement, I just grabbed the guy by their his shirt collar, looked him in the eye, and asked him if they'd rather shut the ignorant hole in their mouth or come meet "Steve" outside in the alleyway. He started shaking, and my producer pulled my hand off of him before any more damage was done, but if you have the look for this, it is a very refreshing option. I always find it funny that people never consider if the gay guy in the room might be stronger than them, they NEVER see it coming.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you could quote another fictional work. I do this a lot. Someone asked me recently why I'm not afraid of God's punishement for being Gay, and I said "Yeah, I know, but what's really scary is how bad Lord Vader is going to kick my *** for being afraid to kill people with the Force." Anything common works, I have also used references to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Great Gatsby, Indiana Jones, The Phantom of the Opera, The X-Files, and Moby Dick. Most of the time this is fairly insulting, and keeps them from responding because they see that you think the Bible is fiction. <br>  <br>  Lastly, a good dig for this is to say "I heard that once, but I gotta be honest, I wasn't a fan of the writing style so I sorta gave up reading it halfway through, and what is with this author, he calls himself "God" and narrates the whole thing off and on, like pick person, 3rd or 1st, not both... it just wasn't believable...

But the commandments were not for us, only for the Jews that lived before Jesus.  Christians are not under the commandments.  Jesus was the fullfillment of those commandments.  God gave the Jews these commandments but they were impossible to keep by imperfect humans.  So whenever a commandment was broken there was a consequence.  The least of which was a daily sacrifice by the priest for himself and for the sins of the people.  When Jesus came, he gave himself as a sacrifice for the sins of humans once and for all.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Just a little surprised you are unable to see the illogical requirement to accept complete bollocks.|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	Read Galatians 5|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	No covenant broken. <br>  <br>  Circumcision was part of the old covenant.

It is a fairly simple procedure, It takes about 5-10 minutes and is done with a local anesthesia, so it's an outpatient procedure. It is, however, a little more complicated in older boys and men than in infants.<br>  <br>  If you choose to be circumcised at this point, you will have stitches, so the doctor who performs the procedure will probably want to know if you are sexually active, and if you are, advise you not to have sex until it heals, because sexual activity can rip the stitches out. <br>  <br>  The decision is a personal one at this point, not a religious one, if you're Christian, and if you do consider it a posibility, you should discuss pros and cons with your doctor.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	I know people are going are not going to like this answer especially "Christians".

However, just as the Angel Gabriel stated when he told her she was to bare the Christ child..."Luk 1:28  And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women."  Notice how it was said, blessed AMONG women, it does not say Above women.  She wasn't meant to be worshiped or placed above any woman, and Paul says,"We no longer know Him(speaking of Christ) after the flesh..."  Therefore, Mary doesn't have any more influence over Him than the rest of us do.

"Salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent."   <br>  <br>  Thus Moses taught faith in Christ and prefigured-in the multitudinous rites and performances of his day-the shedding of our Lord's blood, through which alone salvation comes.   <br>  <br>  And thus Moses mediated between Israel and Jehovah, pleading with Deity on their behalf and offering sacrifices for sin in similitude of the coming sacrifice of God's Son. But Christ himself mediates between his saints and the Father, offering them remission of sins and salvation through his own infinite and eternal sacrifice. The law of Moses is the old covenant; the gospel is the new. Moses is the mediator of the old covenant; Jesus, of the new.   <br>  <br>  15-17. "In legal usage, a testator is one who leaves a valid will or testament at his death. The will or testament is the written document wherein the testator provides for the disposition of his property. As used in the gospel sense, a testament is a covenant. Jesus is the Mediator of the new covenant or testament, that is of the gospel which came to replace the law of Moses." <br>  <br>  In these verses, Paul uses both the legal and the gospel definition of terms and teaches that it is through Christ's death that gifts are willed to men. "In other words, Christ had to die to bring salvation. The testament or covenant of salvation came in force because of the atonement worked out in connection with that death. Christ is the Testator. His gift, as would be true of any testator, cannot be inherited until his death. Christ died that salvation might come; without his death, he could not have willed either immortality or eternal life.  <br>  <br>  15. Mediator of the new testament] See 1 Tim. 2:1-7.   <br>  <br>  New Testament] New covenant, the gospel as restored by Jesus when contrasted with the Old Testament or old covenant which was revealed to Moses.   <br>  <br>  By means of death] Christ came to die for the sins of the world; his mission was to suffer for all men in Gethsemane and then to be lifted up upon the cross. His death and resurrection are the crowning events of his ministry. It is through death that life comes.   <br>  <br>  The redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament] Christ's death saved men in Moses' day. The atonement was retroactive; it was for all men of all ages; its effect was past, present, and future. An angel declared that Christ's "blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam," and that if "the children of men who lived before our Lord's mortal ministry "should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceeding great joy, even as though he had already come among them."    <br>  <br>  First testament] In contrast with the gospel, the law of Moses was the first covenant of salvation and the gospel was the second; in fact, the gospel covenant was "first" given to Adam and was enjoyed by all the faithful saints who preceded Moses and that lesser law given to him.    <br>  <br>  Eternal inheritance] Eternal life, which is inherited through Christ's will, the legal "document" through which life's greatest blessings are bequeathed upon the death of the testator.|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	It was the Birth, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus that changed everything.

These priests would offer sacrifices first for themselves then for the sins of the nation of Israel. There work was Never done. There was no seat to sit down on.One priest would die and then a new one would come along. These sacrifices point to the sacrifice God would make once for all time. This sacrifice was offered by Jesus the sacrificial lamb of God- which was His very own body. Jesus unlike the priests that never were finished is our everlasting High Priest who offered and everlasting perfect sacrifice on the cross, and pronounced "it is finished" The God rose Him from the dead and "sat down" on the right hand of God. This is the new covenent of Christ that all who come to Him and accept His sacrifice will inherrit eternal life and live with God forever. Consequently Jesus being our High Priest makes intercession for His people to God the Father. Like a lawyer of a guilty party to the judge. They are innocent because He offered Himself as the pentalty that removes the charges and penalty.

AA11440601	The Prophecies of St. Malachi do not mention the end of the world. They are merely a list of Popes.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church has not declared the Prophecies of St. Malachi as divinely inspired. <br>  <br>  Some modern scholars even think they are a forgery.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of...</a><br>  <br>  I repeat your quote:<br>  <br>  "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)<br>  <br>  Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.<br>  <br>  Each new Christian denomination seems to worry about the end of the world a bit too much. Then after a couple of centuries, they realize that there are always wars and rumors of wars, etc.<br>  <br>  I won't even mention the hundreds of false predictions of the end of the world over the centuries, all of which were based on individual interpretations of biblical prophecies.<br>  <br>  The first century Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about the end of the world.

As in, "That's a load of malarky". These 'prophecies' have been discarded for a very long time. <br>  <br>  Nobody knows the day or hour.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	When I read "The Year of Three Popes" by Peter Hebblethwaite (about the events of 1978 which saw the death of Paul VI, the election and death of John Paul I, and then the election of John Paul II) he mentions the spate of editorials in the Osservatore Romano and the spate of letters to the editor in the Times of London at the time of the conclaves about what the mottoes attributed to the dead pope or the next pope by St Malachy in his prophecies might mean. Enthralled, I went to the library and looked through the microfilm of the Times to read the letters myself. And then I tried to track down a copy of the prophecies. I have them reproduced below, as well as an explanation of them from the Catholic Encyclopedia. <br>  <br>  The prevailing view today is that they are elaborate forgeries, probably perpretrated by a school of Jesuits in the 1600s. This is based on the clear relation of the mottos to the various popes until that period, and the need to find oblique references (such as the motto of the Pope's home diocese) to make the particular motto fit the particular pope. The inclusion of anti-popes would also appear to militate against the authenticity of the prophecies. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, as each new conclave comes and goes, people start to become a bit jittery about them (since the list runs out soon!). <br>  <br>  Apparently, in 1958, before the Conclave that would elect Pope John XXIII, Cardinal Spellman of New York hired a boat, filled it with sheep and sailed up and down the Tiber River, to show that he was "pastor et nautor", the motto attibuted to the next Pope in the prophecies! <br>  <br>  I think they are a bit of fun, and the semantic exercise of trying to fit the motto to the Pope that goes on in letters to the editor around the world is great reading! <br>  <br>  According to the prophecy, the current Pope may be the second last Pope Gloria Oliv? ("Glory of the Olives"). <br>  <br>  However, it should be noted that some commentators over the centuries have pointed out that there is nothing that says there will be no popes between Gloria Oliv? and Petrus Romanus. It may be that there will be a long line of popes between them!

When the brain starts to die; there is a chemical hormonal change within the brain. That change will effect brain wave activity which may well change the nature of subconsciousness such that you would know that something strange was happening to you.<br>  <br>  Sleep apnea is effectively suffocation. It is where there is a cessation of breathing leading to hypoxia. Normally the human body senses this because the levels of Carbon Dioxide in the blood are raised, leading to a decrease in pH within the bloodstream. The body senses pH change; and the result is a physical response that forces the body to breath and wakes you up. Very few people die of sleep apnea, due to this reflex. Those that do die tend to be people who have a genetic alteration so that the sleep apnea reflex does not work.<br>  <br>  Once the brain's cells have gone through the biochemical changes resulting from excess hypoxia; a process of apoptosis results (programed cell death). As a result all cellular activity is shut down. In such a state the brain cannot function, and no thoughts can be stored; accessed or processed. Ergo when you are dead; if your consciousness has not left the human body; it would not be able to perceive itself to be dead because no thought could be processed with a dead brain. If you're consciousness has left the human body; then it would not perceive thought until it found another structure in which to perceive with. In other words; physical death is the end of thought unless one becomes re-incarnated.<br>  <br>  It is unknown if there are any processes which consciousness can be effected by once a human body has died; and prior to any incarnation.|`|yqqVPcU0aa	Not being conscious isn't the same as being dead.  One comes before the other.  While one is sleeping the brain is active, but not conscious (aware of their surroundings).  So if one dies in ones sleep, they'd never know.  <br>  <br>  Only a 2nd party can tell if a 1st party is dead, the 1st party would of only known what their last thought was before they fell asleep nothing more.  It gives 2nd party people solice to know their loved ones (dying) passed away in their sleep, because they have died peacefully and at rest.  <br>  <br>  Your body stops long before the brain shuts down.  A jump start is possible (Defibralator) as long as the brain is still active.  While you are in a coma you would not know it unless you woke and someone told you you were in one.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	No...because when you are dead you are dead.<br>  <br>  Brain shuts off.Consciousness seizes.

There are plenty of examples where a country starting a process, or stopping a process has caused serious worldwide problems, but this globality can be seen at every level of our lives.<br>  Even from this financial crisis we can only get out if we make a global united effort instead of independent, isolated, especially protectionist measures.<br>  We have to understand, that humanity in fact is a single family, or even a single creature, where we are the individual cells.<br>  So sooner or later we have to harmonize the organization, function, and governance of this single entity.<br>  The most important thing is, that this cannot come by force.

But I think it's very likely that if you start attending the synagogue (after talking to the rabbi), you will gradually find new Jewish friends who will support you as you move forward with conversion.  Certainly, that's what happened to me.  My family are all atheist and there wouldn't be any support there, and most of my friends, while not antagonistic, really didn't 'get' why I was choosing to do this.  But at the synagogue, I found the most wonderful people, of all ages, who offered me a community like I'd never had before.  It took a little time - don't expect an instant sense of belonging, as this doesn't happen anywhere - but it's been the most solid thing in my life for the last 8 years.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I really appreciate the problem of distance to a synagogue.  My synagogue is just over an hour's drive, and it's one heck of a commitment - for two years I was going pretty much every shabbat, either Friday night or Saturday morning.

4K3TuGPzaa	Hi Trueler,<br>  <br>  Let me work - Lass mich arbeiten - BUT: it depends on what you actually want to express, you know. If by that English command you mean to say something like: 'Go away, let me work,' then in German it would be: 'Geh weg, lass mich arbeiten.' - If, however, the situation is more like this: you're sitting alone at your desk, you smile, and you say to yourself: 'Ok, enough lazing around, now: let me work!' - it would be something like this in German: 'Ok, genug gefaulenzt, jetzt will ich mal 'n bischen arbeiten!' - <br>  <br>  Good luck, <br>  whizip   :-)<br>  <br>  P.S.: if you want more of this, email me.|`|SF1uPJZhaa	Okay, I hope I understood what you want.<br>  <br>  I --> Lass mich arbeiten!<br>  You --> Arbeite! / Arbeiten Sie!<br>  He  --> Lass ihn arbeiten!<br>  She --> Lass sie arbeiten!<br>  We --> Lass uns arbeiten!<br>  You --> Arbeitet!<br>  They --> Lass sie arbeiten!<br>  <br>  The difference between "lass" and "lasst" is how many people you are talking to, or asking to let someone work. <br>  lass = 1 person<br>  lasst = 2 and more<br>  <br>  lass uns spielen = informal speech<br>  lassen Sie uns spielen = formal
90grM58Gaa	You can say "lass uns spielen (informal)" or "lassen Sie uns spielen (formal)" if you mean to address just one person that you want to play with.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, "lass uns spielen" resp. "lassen Sie uns spielen" may mean that you and the other players don't want to be bothered / interrupted, i.e., to be left alone so you can go on doing whatever you have been doing.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I get the feeling that Germans wouldn't say that - they tend to be more formal in work situations, but<br>  <br>  Arbeiten Sie zack-zack!

gF8Xpcvwaa	in your mom's mind : bad cook = bad mom. back in the days it was almost a requirement to be a good cook to be a good mom, but in those days, women didn't work and multi task like today, they were home and took care of their families,...yet some women still feel very sensitive about it.<br>  <br>  So when she barks back at you blaming you for all kinds of things, in reality she is just trying to make you feel as bad as she feels about herself.<br>  <br>  Next time, tell her something like : YOU ARE AN AWESOME MOM, but sauce isn't your best recipe loll lo smile and laugh about it, so she doesn't get offended.  I like to always mention something positive before saying something negative to a person, like this they don't feel like I just think negatively of them <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|a0MK1OUTaa	my mom turned into a total psycho whenever she thought someone didn't like her cooking.

When it comes from a family member, it can really add insult to injury.  The next time she cooks her sauce, just eat the rest of the meal plain if possible, and find something else about the meal to compliment.  That way, your mother's cooking won't be totally rejected.   Also, make sure you say nice things(unrelated to food) about and to your mom when it's not mealtime- this will help to improve your overall relationship with her.  Not caring for a particular family recipe does not make you a bad person, and it is perfectly okay for different people to have different tastes- even within a family!|`|WJZbpI9raa	Some people are very sensitive about food they cook. Maybe you could tell her that you're trying to eat your food plain- without the sauce. Or next time, you could offer to cook your own special recipe.<br>  <br>  But if you're a horrible evil child anyway- it's just one more thing for her to get angry about. One day, you'll live on your own and you won't have to deal with her except for the rare visit.

y4SUDnpaaa	I did wear Tabu when I was about 14, everyone did and it would almost knock you to your knees if you were surrounded by a crowd of Tabu wearers. Can't stand it now. I wore My Sin, by the same maker as Chanel #5, when my girls were growing up. After they became young women, the three of us were shopping in old antique and junk shops and there was an almost empty bottle of My Sin and my younger daughter bought it for $30. She said that's the smell she always associated with her childhood and so did the older one. They don't make My Sin anymore so that was the closest thing she could get. I never even thought about them noticing my perfume but they both sniffed that bottle all the way home. I'm always on the look out for something similar or maybe even a full bottle for my older daughter and so is she. If anyone knows where I can buy some, please let me know.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	I did paul...Now...I don't know how I did! it is a bit strong for my senses...lol, It was my first cologne!

mwdwDOaWaa	I will answer if you tell me, everyone is a friend unless WHAT?<br>  <br>  :))<br>  <br>  Ah, yes that 'emptiness' your are not alone, we all go through it, too bad i am guy hence it was hard for to cry like a 'girl', when i felt like crying.<br>  <br>  Peace to you too. The real answer will be stated 'everyone is a friend unless WHAT?' <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  'everyone is a friend unless WHAT?' unless they prove otherwise ' Awwww! nice ideology, so your attitude towards other people is that if they are nice, you are nice to them. But its 'they' who must start the things: talking, a simple conversation etc. So you are a mirror, who reflect as per the image casted by the person<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  Simply one said one would say the hormones, but however I think i may be some subjects that you are studying for the sake of studying, but you don't have you have a genuine interest in them. :))<br>  I hated biology, but i had to take it for 2 yrs in my O' levels, depressed me every time i came never a bio book.<br>  <br>  Or<br>  It may be because, as you are so nice a person, that you are always trying to make friend to at least make every one you (around you) happy. In that case, even if 1 of those people said something rude to you (intentionally or unintentionally), you feel alone, betrayed hence that lonely factor comes into play.<br>  <br>  I am not more wiser than you, i am happy to ignore people (in real life) and be ignored. I think my last 'advise' to you will be to take it a bit slow, 2-3 days. God willing every thing will fall back to places again. Be glad that there are people to surround you, others are less fortunate. <br>  <br>  :)) hope that helps.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I used to feel that way also when I was in School but believe me you when I say this that back then I never thought that life could get any worse for me and it did, life gets worse and more challenging as you get older and quite frankly I wish I was back in School once more coz life was so much better then, so if I were you I'd enjoy life now and be wary of the fact that life can get tougher as you get older and more responsibilities, challenges (often beyond your control) come.

One advice I can give you is that just do something you love whether is going to shopping (what woman doesn't love that), getting your nails done, movies, hanging out with friends, etc. Trust me it won't be long term feeling, it will go away as time goes on.<br>  Take good care of yourself and smile all the time. :-)|`|m6mjcGdKaa	you could be clinically depressed.<br>  <br>  to experience happiness, there is a chemical called serotin which has to go from one part of the brain to the other. when people are actually depressed, there is a chemical imbalance and the serotin cant cross, no matter how good things are going and how happy you feel you should be. definitely consider seeing a doctor, this could be serious and they can give you some medication.<br>  <br>  or maybe you need some excitement in your life. maybe its not contentment you want, but thriving, wild excitement?<br>  <br>  just pray to Allah and it will work out. good luck :]|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	((HUGS))<br>  <br>  Don't worry hun Insha'Allah you'll feel better, prob going through a Phase we all get like that at times, for no reason we feel upset, our damn emotions!

I personally read my Bible more then I listen to sermons, or even read other religious books, but it's certainly not because I find it 'bad' to do otherwise. <br>  <br>  In fact, I think it can become something dangerous to purely study the Bible on your own. In this day and age, everyone and everything has become individualistic and personalized... such as Bible study. It's becoming rarer to find people who also look at other, more mature people's perspectives. In fact, maybe that's why the theology of many is starting to deteriorate; maybe it's because they read their Bible and have no one to challenge them when they come up with a bad interpretation. Or maybe the problem is that people don't read their Bibles at all today... <tries to muffle revivalistic tendencies for the time being> <br>  <br>  So, I think it's very important to get the perspectives of others on scriptural interpretation. Though at the time being I read my Bible more then I listen to clergies, to answer your question.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	More Bible|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	reading the bible lead me to conclude clergy spout hot air, and that christianity doesn't really have much to do with the teaching of jesus.<br>  <br>  studying history,  the history of the bible, church history, combined with the bible lead me to conclude that jesus was a jewish reformer, that saul/paul started the creation of what is now christianity, and that constantine finalized the pagan mixture that is today called christianity.<br>  <br>  the truth will set you free, indeed

It's a violation of freedom of speech.|`|2uOhDMKjaa	words will come in and out of style as the years go by. I think it is all good, and they are just words.|`|AA11579568	Punished? I don't think so.|`|U1chPjvPaa	Words are important, that includes slang and dialects too.  It makes the whole world interesting.  <br>  Having said that, I think there is a time and place for slang, it's pretty much okay here.  But never at school (homework you turn in) or work.   <br>  Words are especially important here because we cannot see each other and read body language, so we must depend on language to express ourselves.
2RzEaod9aa	I guess I missed the part in the Bible where God said, "Nothing bad will ever happen to you, I promise." <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, that's no where in the Bible, and if God gave us all free will, that means God wouldn't be backseat driving the whole way or sticking Their (God is a plural, read Genesis) fingers into your life all the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you're getting so many stupid answers. These people need to open the Bible and find where God promises to give you everything and make your life happy and nice. Even in the Gospels where Christ says that if we ask/seek/etc., we shall be given, the examples He lists are all ones of life and death situations. Even then, it's up to God. The Bible doesn't say anywhere that "God works in mysterious ways," but it's pretty hard to figure out how the hell God would work.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	here comes the old man creates evil arguement, which doesn't explain your 1st line|`|TEaFwk1Baa	Actually he did make my football team win.

If you have faith, you don't question your God and his decisions. If you don't, then you understand that evil exists as a part of life and accept it.<br>  <br>  ok... so what if having no free will meant that every person on earth just served as a worker bee to build churches and attend sermons? no love, no pain, no joy, nothing. no free will would mean all those things.

AA11232725	Because not everyone is gifted and called to be able to understand some things in the Bible and in fact no one can fully comprehend God's Word in all it's entirety. <br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:11  And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,  12  for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,  13  till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;  14  that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,  15  but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ  16  from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.<br>  <br>  2 Peter 3:15  and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation--as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,  16  as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable people twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.|`|VncSMLMpaa	I think that like anything else worthwhile you have to work at it.

Seek Him and compare all Scriptures for you will find Scripture interprets Scripture, one passage will unlock another and give the full meaning. It is for you to find them and consider and meditate upon them. Just as men mine for gold and precious stones so you are to dig and sift in the Bible for spiritual treasure. The Bible quickened by the Spirit is a means of communion with God and He will lead you and give understanding. Familiarity with all of the Bible will enable Him to teach and show you. He will lead you to prayer and there is so much there that you could spend all your time and always find more.<br>  <br>  But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <br>  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <br>  <br>  <br>  And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? <br>  <br>  <br>  Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dispense with the commentaries of men and depend upon God, for what men tell you is head knowledge but what God shows you is real and in the heart, and you develop a deeper knowledge of Him and bond with Him. Infinitely to be preferred. That is why God has made it to be "hard to understand" so that you will seek Him and find Him. So many fail of His blessing for ease and a quick fix from men which in the end is worthless. Rather spend time with Him in the Bible. Besides He will show you far more than men are able.<br>  <br>  I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.|`|uKrRyVgVaa	Bible is not a Gods word as it was written by men and changed by men to make it more appealing to people.

In many industries it can take six months plus to find a new job and many people keep at least 3 months worth of normal expenses in the bank; it is often recommended to keep at least that much in reserve. I have friends who keep a couple years worth of expenses in the bank because her husband is a contract worker, and they never know when he might not have work for extended periods of time. <br>  <br>  The school trip expense might be a  matter of priorities. We may not want to pay for premium hot chocolate, but might go to the movies once a month, which costs a lot more. She may feel like the school trips are luxuries and that what she did buy were somehow more important. Also, she may have already had money put aside for these things. Or she could just not be thinking straight, sometimes people do that when they are stressed.<br>  <br>  If she were spending tens of thousands and that was out of profile for how they normally live, only then I would say it sounds suspicious.

Look you don't have to be uncertain about going to heaven, if you are born again and in a relationship with Jesus then you can be sure that you are going to heaven.  If you don't know whether this is the case then you need to pray to God to help you and read the Bible to 'make your calling and election sure' as Peter says.

2h8tqOeFaa	I believe so, science can only discover what exists, it cannot and will not ever be able to create or form life from non life, so that in itself logically tells us that life is an organism that could never have come from non life, but it came from an already existing one, which brings us back to an eternal life existence of some kind, that i believe is God..

They signed a treaty that Muawiya could be the ruler but Imam Hassan would be the Muslim Caliphate and needed to be consulted in all matters and that Muawiya could not appoint Yazeed as his successor. Muawiya signed the treaty but did not keep the promise. I also wonder why they consider Yazeed a great man. From a majlis I have just recently heard the shiek searched in the Sunni books why the Sunni believe Muawiya and his son are great men.In those books written by themselves they report that Yazeed was a womanizer, a pedophile, had belly dancers with him at all times, and also craved the company of a young men with no facial hair.

However, after 700 years due to continuous persecution they had to stop exposing his falsehood. The Sunni Ijtehad was closed by the governments after 400 years, and after 700 years there were hardly any sunni books which exposed Muawiyah's government. A prime example of this tragedy is what happened to the Ahle Sunnah's scholar Imam Nasa'i ra.gif who was martyred by sunnis themselves for saying Muawiyah has no merit expect for the dua which made against him. The dua was by RasoolAllah pbuh.gif who said "May Allah never fill his stomach" However, there are still few sunni scholars who are willing to stick to the path of their traditional sunni scholars.

Let us not forget the fact that Ali (a.s.) was the rightful caliph of his time and according to the traditions of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) it was incumbent upon all Muslims to obey him, and this included Muawiyah.<br>  <br>  Secondly, during the caliphate of Imam Hasan (a.s.), one of the chiefs of the youth of Paradise, Muawiyah continued his political intrigue till Imam Hasan (a.s.) was forced to abdicate the caliphal seat in view of the risk to Islamic nation and Muslims.<br>  <br>  And when Muawiyah secured the throne, he used illegal (Haraam) methods against his opponents and against the followers of Ali (a.s.).<br>  <br>  He tyrannised the people by sword and by stopping their allowances from the public treasury if they were from the Shias of Ali (a.s.).<br>  <br>  He initiated the evil practice of cursing Ali (a.s.) from the pulpits of mosques.<br>  <br>  He was the first to create feelings of racial discrimination between tribes and nationalities. Arabs and non-Arabs were given different status. The amount of allowance varied for different classes of people.<br>  <br>  He promoted the fabrication of traditions disparaging Ali (a.s.) and gave impetus to hadith in favour of his son Yazeed, who was a well-known transgressor of his time.<br>  <br>  He distorted the face of Islam through the creation of misguided sects like the ‘Murjea’ etc.<br>  <br>  He ordered the poisoning of the beloved grandson of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.), Imam Hasan (a.s.). This was carried out through the Imam’s wife, Judah bin Ashath bin Qays, by holding out a false promise to have her married to Yazeed.<br>  <br>  After Muawiyah had broken the terms of treaty with Imam Hasan (a.s.), he said: "O people of Kufa! Did I fight you for prayers, zakat and hajj? Indeed you already pray, pay zakat and perform hajj. I fought you to rule over you. And indeed, Allah gave me this honour and debased you.<br>  <br>  All the blood that has been shed over here deserved to be shed and every term of the treaty is trampled under my feet."<br>  <br>  REFERENCE:<br>  Sharh Nahjul Balagha 16/14<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- <br>  <br>  But Yazeed was way ahead of his father, Muawiyah! He tried in vain to obtain the pledge of allegiance by force from Imam Husain (a.s.). Even after breaking the terms of treaty with his brother Imam Husain (a.s.). We all know the position of Imam Hasan (a.s.) near the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.). Many a times the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) remarked.<br>  <br>  "Husain is from me and I am from Husain."<br>  <br>  REFERENCE:<br>  Fadailul Khamsa Vol. 3, Pg. 263<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- <br>  <br>  The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) also wept when Imam Husain (a.s.) was in his cradle. And he had prophesied the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.). Rather, he had forecasted his killing by a renegade group and even indicated the exact location. He (s.a.w.s.) took a handful of soil from that place (Karbala) and gave it to Ummul Momineen Umme Salmah and told her to keep it with her, saying that when Husain (a.s.) will be martyred, that soil would turn into blood.<br>  <br>  REFERENCE:<br>  Tabaqat Ibne Sa’ad, Tradition no. 269<br>  <br>  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- <br>  <br>  This is Husain (a.s.), the chief of the youth of Paradise, who himself said about Yazeed,<br>  <br>  "Yazeed is a transgressor, a drunkard and a murderer.

What is to be said of Yazeed? After the serious carnage, they ordered the beheading of the martyrs. Even though, Imam Husain (a.s.) had exhausted all arguments. He was martyred alongwith his companions and family members in a condition of extreme thirst. He was having his women and children with him. The corpses of martyrs were trampled under the hooves of horses; then the ladies and children (especially, Hazrat Zainab (s.a.), the lion-hearted lady of Karbala) were taken as prisoners of war.<br>  <br>  In their midst was the ailing youth, Imam Ali ibne Husain (a.s.) – titled Zainul Abdeen (ornament of the worshipper). Then they beheaded the corpses and carried the heads on the points of lances.

WoxA3ilFaa	One of the best teachers of magic I have ever come across (and my first teacher too) is a man called Oberon-Zell Ravenheart. He has written several books and he and the Grey Council ( a very wise band of wizards and witches) have, together, written a book call "Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard" and its follow up "Companion to the Apprentice Wizard". They contain all you need to know on magic. I suggest you look for them. They also have a website <br>  www.greyschool.com <br>  It is a fantastic online school for learning magic both practical and theoretical, anyway I hope this helps. Good Luck.|`|3wFNqFZIaa	<a href="http://spellsofmagic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spellsofmagic.com/</a><br>  <br>  That site should help you, I hope.

You can find them at the library, or you can buy them from any book store in the new age section. <br>  Although you're not asking about Wicca specifically, it's a good place to start. Scott Cunningham makes great books for beginners.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	i wouldnt trust websites.<br>  pick up some books on magick. or if you are interested in magickal/pagan religions like wicca, shamanism, or what not.<br>  <br>  books are the best thing to learn from. and don't just take the word of one book, read several and many. <br>  you can't rush learning.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	The simplest magic is really the strongest, the most basic: your instinct?<br>  <br>  You have a 'golden compass' already installed within you. If you are asking about magick, the compass already knows the kind of magick you are looking for and where you should look for it. It's not about finding the 'right' sight, its about being able to listen to yourself, the self that already knows the information exists and just needs you to believe in it.<br>  <br>  Belief in yourself works for more than just over-paid motivational speakers, it works for neophyte hermione wannabe's as well.|`|zc47c39daa	I wouldn't advise random websites, or doing random searches because it could lead you down a false path, but here's a good source to get started:<br>  <br>  www.witchvox.com<br>  <br>  Blessed be! :D<br>  <br>  P.S: Yes you can learn. Some people are born into it, others are attracted to magick. There are religions such as Paganism and Wicca that relate to magick, but that's certainly not all. Just take a look around :) If you are interested in magick though just to cast spells and be magickal and whatnot, I don't suggest going into this close-minded because you will probably be disappointed.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	Depends on the type of magic you are talking about. There are many traditions out there that work with magic (not just Wicca, people!!!). Do some research on different traditions that work with magic. Also read books (there are libraries, book stores, internet)...join a forum and ask questions, go to witchvox.com and find people with similar interestes, or study groups in which you can join and learn.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	u wish to learn to invoke a demon's power?

O2YHv1fiaa	I would make him tell the neighbor and apologize to them. Also he needs to repay the neighbor. You also need to go along with him to make sure that he does the right thing. If your neighbor wants to call the police, then that is his right. I realize times are tough, but that does not give anyone the right to break in to another persons home to steal. Do the right thing now or else this will get out of control in the future. I am sure you don't want your son to become a career criminal.|`|F4IjI9qaaa	I would march his sorry butt over to the neighbors to apologize, make good and take what he had coming. If that means dealing with the police because the neighbor wants to press charges, so be it. This is a serious situation and I wouldn't be doing him any favors by helping to hide what he did. There are consequences for every action and better he learns now that he will have to suffer the consequences of poor judgment. This certainly is a defining moment for all concerned.|`|GQJuJ7KWaa	No, just find another way to pay for what the money was used for, if a recurring necessity. For example, if he bought food, then no big deal. But, if he stole money to pay a cable bill, something that you do not need to live on, then more drastic action should be taken to reprimand him, but I do not think it is necessary to call the police, unless it becomes an epidemic, and he develops a problem with theft, and uses theft as a means to provide for himself and those who he is responsible for.|`|VWEBbhj4aa	But if you do report it to the authorities, it will be beyond your control at that point. I have a client who reported that her teenage son took her car. Now he is facing 3 years in a juvenile facility and she is totally freaking out. She has tried to drop the charges and the state refuses to do so. You can't unring a rung bell.|`|ndzQlxtHaa	no i would not. actually it depends on the situation. first if i do not know why he did it, i'll ask and try to talk this through with him. if i do, i'll explain to him that it's wrong, and whatever might come from it isn't worth the risk he is taking. his whole reputation and life becomes in danger too. i would certainly not report him to the police unless i find myself in one of those situations where he becomes a real danger to other people and if he won't listen to me at all. let's say he's a serial killer or a terrorist, that's what i mean by danger to other people. reporting him means that for the rest of his life he'll have police files and that could really mess up his life. as long as i think that he can understand and change, or that i can still influence him, i won't do that to him. so it really depends on a lot of things : his age, the strength of your relationship with him, how much you think he listens to you (even if he doesn't want to show it, and of course the gravity of the crime and how likely he is to repeat it and why.<br>  those questions, only you can answer them, but they'll help you find an answer to your question.|`|TZ18Qdilaa	It depends. First of all, I would absolutely "make it right" to the neighbors by returning the items and paying to fix any damage to the house. If your son is a repeat offender, I would report him and make him face the consequences of his actions. If your son is young and just made one stupid mistake, I would not report him but would make sure he made it right. <br>  Perhaps rake that neighbor's yard for the entire summer. SOMETHING.|`|zHIMUt42aa	If he used the money to help at home and not for drugs, alcohol, or the intent to do harm to others and felt that that was his only option. I am sure whatever he stole is not worth as much as a paycheck he could have received working and the benefit of understanding that contributing to the household if under financial stress is better done honestly. Is is up to you. A criminal charge will be filed against him. I suggest you insist he earn the money by working and then have him turn himself in and with the money pay restitution and damages and notify the victim this is his intent. They may choose not to press charges and accept his direct payment without law enforcement involvement. But having the money up front with the intent to pay it back to the victim will go a long way in setting him on thee right path.|`|dGUZsAobaa	Depends on how old he is, how often this has occurred. Unless it was a frequent occurrence I would have him confess to the neighbor and pay back the money.|`|FVu2vERpaa	There is no excuse for stealing. I would report him.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Yes, I would and have them take him down to the station and lock him up for a few hours to teach hm a lesson, also he would be grounded for a month and no computer and no TV and no video games and no going out at all. If he did that a second time, I would send him to a boot camp.|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	I am with beach bum. That kid would have to go right back to the neighbor and face the consequences. I would apologize myself and make it right (as best I can, some things can't be made right, like trust) and then no matter what happened at that point I would definitely punish him myself on top of what the neighbor/county might want. They would have to learn that not only does not the city not tolerate it I would not tolerate it in my home.

AA12361841	maybe amongst themselves. I don't think it's very popular yet*|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Chrsitmas is nothing to do with either Christianity or Islam but it does have it's origins in the midwinter festival and many other basically pagan rites but since much of it is a celebration of nature rather than religion everyone should be able to enjoy it and be happy together despite religion!!<br>  <br>  The ancient European pagans celebrated the midwinter festival and a number of other festivals long before Christianity ever existed!<br>  <br>  Babylonians celebrated the feast of the Son of Isis with gluttonous eating and drinking, and gift giving and the goddess of fertility, love, and war. <br>  <br>  The Romans held a festival on 25 December called “Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, celebrating their own god Sol Invictas - PAGAN.<br>  <br>  The Persian god Mithras, the Syrian sun god Elah Gabal, the German Sol, the Greek Helios and the Mesopotamian Shamash.  But also Saturnalia, honouring Saturn, the God of Agriculture. The law courts and schools were closed. No public business could be transacted an this is where the holidays originated - ALL PAGAN!!!<br>  <br>  Wax tapers were given by the more humble to their superiors. The origin of the Christmas candle - PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  In Rome groups of costumed went from house to house entertaining their people. And this was where the carolling Christmas tradition originated PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  Statues of the Mother and lover or Mother and son were paraded through the streets not only in Italy but also in Africa, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and Bulgaria. Thus, the symbolism of the Heavenly Virgin and the infant child paraded on a yearly basis are not of Christian origin. They stem from the Mother-goddess religion, which is very ancient ENTIRELY PAGAN!!.<br>  <br>  Scandinavian countries celebrated Yule honouring Thor - PAGAN.  <br>  <br>  In Germania (not Germany) they celebrated midwinter night followed by 12 wild nights of eating and drinking.  The 12 days of Christmas PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  The church under Pope Julius I declared that Christ’s birth would be celebrated on December 25 in 350 AD in order to try to hijack the PAGAN festivals but it was largely ignored.  Christians did not really celebrate Christmas until 378 but it was then dropped in 381 and not resurrected until 400.<br>  <br>  The Christmas tree stems from pagan tradition and ritual surrounding the Winter Solstice, which included the use of holly boughs ivy  and other foliage as an adaptation of pagan tree worship.  Holly and ivy represented male and female.  Mistletoe was considered a sacred plant, and the custom of kissing under the mistletoe began as a fertility ritual - all PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  Santa Claus came from the Dutch “Sinterklaas” and was a tall figure riding a white horse through the air and usually accompanied by Black Peter, an elf who punished disobedient children.  Also the origin of the reindeer, sleigh and the elves ALL PAGAN!!<br>  <br>  The modern red coated Santa was brought about by coca cola!!<br>  <br>  America actually banned Christmas several times and is the originator of the expression  “Happy Holidays” which came about because of the pagan origins of Christmas to include all religions and traditions!!<br>  <br>  Easter is set by the first full moon after the vernal equinox. This is the one day in the year when day and night are roughly equal!<br>  <br>  It varies by more than a month over the years and so it simply cannot represent the date of anyone's death!!!<br>  <br>  It is in fact a combination of several pagan festivals most notably the spring festival.<br>  <br>  The name Easter comes from “Eastre” an Anglo-Saxon pagan goddess. Also the Norse goddess,Ostara who took her name from the Teutonic lunar goddess Eostre<br>  <br>  Even the Chinese have the festival of Ching Ming where flowers and sweets are put on their ancestors graves!!<br>  <br>  The egg and the rabbit are symbols of springtime and rebirth along with the custom of giving flowers etc!!<br>  <br>  The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals.  Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!!<br>  <br>  Scratch the Christian and you find the pagan – spoiled.  -  Israel Zangwill|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	lets see how many theists say BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE APRIL FOOLS DAY!!!11!!!!11!~!!!!

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes, you should be able to avoid this.  "Unlisted" doesn't necessarily mean totally unlisted.  With my phone company, I had to ask for a completely unlisted number (they won't even allow someone through in an emergency).  Then, what they normally don't tell you, there is a separate number that you need to call for your number NOT to show on people's caller ID's and on the internet.  There isn't another fee for this but they won't tell you about it either.  Do you know if your number comes up when you call others?<br>  <br>  Every phone company is different though.  You will need to call yours to see what else you have to do.  Also, do not give out your phone number indiscriminately.  What I mean by this is that there are several retailers have have started asking for your number at the cash register.  Simply say NO.  They can sell your information.<br>  <br>  Also, you will want to get on your state and the national "Do not call" lists.

The uncomfortableness is how people recognize things are fundamentally different, that going forward from that moment is what we were meant to do, in order to get to this moment, and going forward from this moment is how we are supposed to get to our next 'a ha' moment.<br>  <br>  We are all alien visitors to our past, and this is how it should be.|`|zEoRcL91aa	What do you mean by tribe? Tribes date back from colonial times when colonial authorities tried to classify who lived where without thinking that most people migrated with rains.<br>  <br>  What are real and unreal purposes? If you mean you are of African descent trying to trace your roots, then I'd say you are living with rose-tinted glasses stuck permanently on your face!<br>  <br>  In the continent (not country) of Africa, there is a thing called diversity in language, culture etc. You are looking at over 4 000 languages alone. In my country, there are 11 official languages and at least another 30 or 40 minority languages.|`|UVFtr5f4aa	Unless the values and traditions of your true ancestors have been passed down to you in your childhood and you have chosen to be true to those values will you feel like you fit it with your tribe. <br>  <br>  Some societies gives us sort of a false identity. They wants us to be selfish and not want to think of others but that is not our nature and goes against why we are here. Other cultural societies and tribes still give us hope as they care about the community and take care of the group not just themselves. <br>  <br>  I accepted my family values as they were taught but I don't fit in with my family anymore as those values seem to be no longer followed because they have accepted societies views.  I do still feel like I'm closer to my grandparents because they knew their purpose and understood the importance of living a healthy life not a selfish one.|`|RrYZMF24aa	it depends on what mythos you believe in. If your christian you think that you come from noah and his kin. Which does nothing to explain why different races exist.

VJnuDRR9aa	Yes.I was at a gathering of believers on a Saturday evening and someone remarked ".Everyone sure is quite and not near as chatty as usual."<br>  <br>  One lady said "well I woke up at 3AM and  I started to pray and when  I next looked at th clock it was almost  time to get up." Another  said "That's strange  the same thing happened to me"<br>  Then another and another and some who were in another area joined in and said that has happened frequently to them also.<br>  <br>  The following  regular congregational bible study night when questions are answered  a friend asked  "Is praying at 3AM  something Christians do?<br>   Everyone started to chuckle and the conductor said "well you would think there would be a better time but recently it seems I wake up at that time and it really is quiet and peaceful and everything from the busy day is  at rest  I have found it to be a perfect time to  pray and even meditate on some passages in scripture." <br>  <br>  Needless to say there was a whole  discussion again and we finally concluded that God's spirit was gently awaking us because we all needed this time with him and to reflect on our relationship and strengthen it without any disturbance or interferences from  outside just a Quality time with our Lord.|`|c3MFIbeUaa	I work nights so 3. A.m. is quite a great time to pray.<br>   In fact I suggest we all try it when we are up at that hour.<br>   There is power in prayers and it will help this country out tremendously.<br>   I also suggest that any hour is great for prayer!<br>   ((DEB)) (NEW GRANDMOM))|`|CmHLKKODaa	I do sometimes !<br>  <br>  When I was first saved He would get me up at 3 AM and I would read and talk to Him !<br>  He lets me sleep later now, most of the time !<br>  =)|`|tManvxfQaa	Yes...often and Yes i do...<br>  <br>  But i awake all through the night and pray...but yeah seems that time happens allot !!|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	yeah that happens to me all the time, its weird.

It's sometimes hard to get up. The flesh would prefer to roll over and bundle up under the blanket, but it is such a worthwhile habit to get into -- to spend time with the Lord in His Word and in prayer.<br>  <br>  I usually get alone on the couch and pray over my Bible like it's a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  "...Give [me] this day [my] daily bread..."<br>  <br>  Then I break it open and read at the first place I come to. Usually after about a chapter, I'll stop and talk to HIm about whatever's on my mind. Sometimes, during times of crisis, when I pray over my "Bread from Heaven", the very first verse I lay my finger on will speak directly to the situation of the day. It's really more than just ink on paper after all; it's the Living Word of the Living God.<br>  <br>  Ps 139:17 -- How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.|`|gogyuwKWaa	Wtf?|`|7xkwE3X9aa	No.<br>  &<br>  I don't pray.|`|CB9a6q9Waa	I've always had trouble sleeping.

I've seen quite a bit actually right at that particular time.|`|vciEtUcPaa	I've heard before about 3 a.m. being the best time to pray and because of the forces of darkness being shut down at that time,but I don't know how true that is.I'm up at all kinds of hours of the night and when my wife gets up,it's a perfect time to pray.Because of busyness during the day and whatever else is going on;late at night is for me a more opportune time to pray.|`|zw1gjkSKaa	No Im up at 3:am ,on here working pray for me-|`|AA11613315	OMG YES!!!!

A lot of people wake up a couple of hours before their actual rising time.  They have had a good sound sleep and have a wake-up, roll over, and have a lighter level snooze until the alarm rings.  Praying at that time wouldn't interrupt your sleep cycle.|`|TEaFwk1Baa	It is the hour of the wolf|`|t88527U1aa	Yes this is a very spiritual time, When I first became a believer God woke me at 3am to read and learn and pray.

2b00bc19a3df7a255d732dd320a6a54caa	You seem to be a compassionate person. Compassion means "with pain," meaning that if you feel compassion for someone, you feel their pain. To respond to the needs (pain) of someone else feels very good indeed, especially if your actions take away that pain.<br>  <br>  I too struggle with depression, and I too am a spiritual person. There is no better high for me than helping others. I guess it gives me a sense of self worth; I mean, something I said or did helped someone else? How wonderful! But at the core of this nice feeling is the joy of lifting the weight off of someone else's shoulders.<br>  <br>  One quick example: my daughter has a breathing disorder. A friend of my dad's called me a week ago to ask questions about one aspect of my daughter's health care, because his wife has MS and also struggles with breathing. We had a 10 minute conversation, and at the end he was so grateful. The best part of it is that the tension in his voice had completely gone away, and he no longer feared the medical procedure they were going to have to perform on his wife.<br>  <br>  Well, I've rambled. In short, it's a wonderful thing to give, to be compassionate, to help those in need. All of us have gifts to share; I hope that you will continue sharing yours. Peace.|`|AA12194228	It is the kind thing to do and we were taught to be kind. Go ahead and feel good about doing that.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because you are thinking of others unselfishly and doing things for them.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	there are lots of reasons. One is the feeling of gratitude we receive from the person we did a good deed for, and just knowing that you have made their day a little easier. You also feel a sense of importance. You were important to that lady, you made a difference in her day. She needed you. You were needed.<br>  <br>  You can also imagine how nice it would feel to have someone else do that for you. Knowing that you are doing something for someone that YOU would have been thankful for makes you feel good.|`|oVHFz52Laa	God knows we have a pleasure when we love our neighbors.|`|boqwvEvUaa	i don't know ;) i just like seeing people happy, so i smile at them and help them! 8D i guess you feel that way too--yay for you!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Yes, I just love seeing a smile.  :)|`|MM5iGrnIaa	A lot of people just do nice things to feel good about themselves, which in my opinion is a very selfish reason to help a person.  Half the time, I don't really want to help anyone, but do so anyway because it's the right thing to do in some cases.|`|x08oohwpaa	I don't believe in god but I believe in helping my fellow man.<br>  <br>  It does feel good to be the change you want to see in the world.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Because human altruism is a good surviving tool. You have better chance at survival in packs rather than shun everyone from you and try and survive on your own. This promotes kind behavior to fellow humans.|`|CBUPymktaa	it just seems like a real purpose in life i guess .. i occasionally like disturbing people to .. go figure ..|`|m3iRfxysaa	Because I know they'll be saving up to $100 a year on auto insurance...<br>  <br>  ...oh yeah, and because their money goes to me instead of the gecko.
iwNYcerfaa	If this was my own personal dilema. I would honestly just come out before the trip. See how many will drop out of the trip and how many go. That will be the way of knowing who is going to stab you in the back and make fun of you for being whom you are. And I think it'd be hilarious to see a buncha girls on one side of the room. You could even scare them into not sleeping. haha. But that just me. I get a kick out of that thing.|`|R7MD0WByaa	Um... If you feel anxiety over not being out of the closet, then come out now.  But I do understand your perspective and it could definitely get lonely if they aren't understanding of you being lesbian.  Maybe come out to your family but not friends quite yet?  <br>  <br>  But really, when in doubt, come out!|`|Y3Fp6oKxaa	Do not say anything to anyone there is no point in telling them<br>  your friends would feel funny about it<br>  and if the bitches get wind of things they will make your life hell just for the fun of it.<br>  just enjoy your trip & let them enjoy theirs no need to change anything just yet<br>  good luck have a safe trip & be happy with yourself girl|`|GjfWcWj6aa	I would leave it for now.<br>  They don't need to know do they? So i wouldn't tell them.<br>  Even after the trip, only come out if you feel you want to. Sometimes coming out isn't a good thing.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	I can see why you are confused. The only advice would be to do what YOU feel is right. No matter when you do it; those "bitchy" girls will have something to say. That is what makes them bitchy. People fear what they do not understand; however they deal with it should not be your concern. Come out when it feels right to you, not when you think others will be more accepting of you. Good luck. Be proud of who you are.|`|vrsMTzNYaa	I would wait, because if you coming out turns all pear shaped and so on you are going to have to stay there and live through it until you all leave!  there is no rush you don't need to tell them, it's not as if you are going to turn into a lesbian ware-wolf at midnight is it,|`|dktZ2O7waa	there's no better time then the present<br>  if you tell them after there gonna think you were checking them out and what not and who ever is uncomfortable is just gonna have to deal<br>  its your life and who ever doesn't accept you for who you are then they screw them.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	I agree with lezzy_69.I would try to freak them out.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would comeout before,but thats just me.|`|zsFcsmxIaa	do what JJ said..<br>  <br>  leave it for now..<br>  <br>  but talk to the girl who you love cuz hopefully she would understand if ur close friends you know what i mean?|`|MWIKAz9Oaa	You don't have very good friends if they are not understanding, and they should be lucky if you were attracted to them. Honestly most girls don't like girls who like over girls cause they're worried they'd be attracted to them, or do a simple act like touch their leg by accident and secretly like it lol. Here is my message to those people DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF! Just because lesbians like girls, doesn't mean they're gonna like you! From what you've described, it seems like they're gonna be bitches regardless of whether you come out now, or after.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Don't come out yet<br>  <br>  Share with the girl you mention though|`|QOHrPeXKaa	If I were you I would wait until i felt absolutely comfortable, then come out. Wait until you feel the time is just right.

Hup47cX4aa	You, sir, hit it right on the dot.|`|nx7QtF0paa	First off no Christian lives in sinless perfection, and you're right when you say they are liars if they say otherwise.  However, when one becomes born again, they are a changed being because of the Holy Spirit that lives in them... It means, they sin less, and when they do, they recognize it and immediately repent.  If someone is a Christian and living like the devil and has no conviction of that sin, the they are not a Christian.  <br>  <br>  Second as Christians we are supposed to judge righteously... not hypocritically. <br>  <br>  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  Matthew 7:3<br>  <br>  We are all sinners, which is why we need the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour.... because if we all got what we deserved we'd get death and Hell and any Christian that says otherwise is a liar.<br>  I hope that helps.|`|b9DhpqhUaa	No Christian is free of sin. We are all born into sin, and will always be sinners. It is a matter of how we handle it. If we accept God and ask him to save and forgive us he will. He forgives sins past present and future. And every time you sin, you just ask for forgiveness and our loving father will forgive. Thats what he died for.|`|TdMX8365aa	Christians are human too and Jesus knew we would not be perfect and that is why He died for our sins.|`|xZet9Dunaa	none every body sins|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	Because we're human too...|`|sE94HgDBaa	I counted and only zero have stopped sinning.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Your reasoning is kind of odd.  Just because Christians arent free from sin (as no one else is either) doesnt mean they can't spread God's word.  No one is perfect man, and God knows that|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	It is really hard to understand what your question is. You answered the only question that you asked.<br>  <br>  If a person is walking the walk, they must be doing some talking to tell others about the love of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  None of us are perfect until we are in heaven. We are not preaching perfection but we are preaching the love of God for us and that we should love and respect Him in return.  <br>  <br>  Since we love God we try really hard to not sin and we do not live in perpetual sin.|`|uFAoq4idaa	None because every one who is in this world still commit sin. But the good thing for us Christians who are sealed by the Holy Spirit could easily discern that we are sinning. So we can directly go to God and ask forgiveness. God forgives us even how many times we commit sins but not the sin we know will make us forsake Him.|`|vvgodUChaa	i sin daily but i stand in christ rightiousness because i have none of my own,he is worthy not me,but all sins was taken away at the cross,that is why he can give us eternal life now when we beleive in his finish work at the cross,hopoe this helps!|`|vDr5aROwaa	Trust me, I am a Christian and there is none without sin.As for Christians telling people to follow God, that is right, and we do try to follow God, but that does not mean that we are not going to sin. What I see wrong is for a Christian to point out to someone a sin. I don't do that. I try to help anyone that I can, and I do tell them that we should try to follow God, but in no way shape or form am I going to expect people not to sin. I know that there are a lot of Christians who think that they don't sin, but they are wrong. As long as we have this blood running through our veins, we will sin. But I do believe that the closer we get to God, we start to sin less, but we will in this life never be sinless. If there was anyway that we could be sinless, then why did Jesus come to die for us? We could have just worked on not sinning and save Jesus dying on the cross for us.
yCTxg4t5aa	I believe that whatever you believe will happen to yourself is what will happen to you. like you said to each their own.<br>  Some go to Heaven, Some are reborn which is why new souls are created and you can have souls of different "ages." Those that believe that life just ends will be absorbed into the universe and their energy used for something else, the silly people that think they'll be punished in Hell will be, but it'll be their own fault for thinking so. But you have to realise that all Heaven/Hell, Reincarnation, the Summerlands etc are all from separate religions (i'm probably a little freak to believe in them all and i doubt there's anyone else who believes as i do) so one person who believes in one probably won't believe in the others.<br>  And Ghosts/Spirits can be different things, sometimes they're just Echos, like a memory stamped onto a certain place, usually cause by heightened emotions or thoughts at/near the time of death, most times people can see or hear them but they'll just disappear or ignore you if you try to interact with them. Others are confused, don't know that they've died, or like the old saying have unfinished business, and Others just want to stick around for loved ones or just to make a nuisance of themselves, the last ones can usually be reasoned with, if you ask them to stop doing something they usually will, and if not it's very easy to kick them out of your house.|`|XxWovDNCaa	Yes.<br>  It's all myths, lies and fairy tales.<br>  Oh, and that's not opinion, it's verifiable fact.|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	Heaven is for God's followers or good people, I don't believe in Hell, ghosts are spirits or demons, reincarnation is some random thing, past lives are some random things.<br>  <br>  If you want info<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven#In_Christianity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven#In_C...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell#Christianity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell#Christ...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghosts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ghosts</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation#Christianity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnati...</a>|`|b9DhpqhUaa	There is a heaven and a hell and if you people would read your bibles you would know that. When you die and you are saved you go to heaven. If you die and you are not saved you will go to hell. Satan was one of Gods angels and when he turned from god he went to hell to try and convert people to his side. There arent really ghosts there are angels.

They are only considered a person after fertilization.<br>  <br>  The problem here isn't that one side is right and one is wrong, it's that both look at it differently.

Most people seem to equate that with pro-murder -- but it's not, by any means.  I simply believe that a woman has a right to control what occurs within her own body -- within reason, of course.  Failed birth control, a one-time mistake, etc. are human errors -- and I believe abortion is a humane solution.  Within the first few months, the fetus will feel no pain.  They cannot survive outside the womb, and are not more than a clump of cells that could someday BECOME a child -- as far as I'm concerned, no different than an egg or sperm cell.  I have found few decent, non-religious arguments against abortion.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you were to take a one-month pig fetus and a one-month human fetus, there is a good chance that a person would be unable to distinguish between the two -- and yet, the rights of one are protected because it is a life, and the rights of the other are protected so that it will grow large and be killed, then eaten.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, ideal standards for any state are as follows:<br>  <br>  I believe that a woman considering abortion should be offered a chance to learn about adoption, open adoption, and organizations that can help her if she chooses to keep her child.<br>  <br>  Then:<br>  <br>  Within the first trimester, an abortion is her decision.  If she chooses to terminate the pregnancy, her physician must give her a basic examination to ensure that her body and her mind are both competent for an abortion, and she should be asked to supply a reason.  However, she may decline to comment on reasoning within these first three months.  Information should be offered to her regarding birth control and someone to talk to both before and after the pregnancy is terminated.<br>  <br>  Within the second trimester, the woman needs to give a reason and speak with a qualified therapist / someone of a similar position regarding her choice, and to ensure she is of sound mind.  During this appointment, she and the therapist will discuss alternative means of dealing with the issue, such as a way for her to keep the child, or considering adoption.  If both the physician and therapist sign off that she is a candidate for abortion, the choice is hers.  During one of these appointments, she must also discuss birth control plans with her doctor and be urged to choose a safe, secure method of preventing future pregnancies.<br>  <br>  During the third trimester, abortion will not be acceptable unless a life-threatening condition presents itself.  In this situation, the abortion must be cleared and performed by a doctor.  If termination of the pregnancy is deemed necessary, it should be done as a last resort.  If at all possible, an emergency C-section should be attempted -- with proper care, it is possible that the child will survive and live a healthy life with an adoptive couple from this point.  At least three appointments with a therapist should be made and kept.  <br>  <br>  Partial birth abortion is never acceptable, and should not be considered or attempted at any times, under penalty of law.<br>  <br>  Women 13 - 16 are subject to all of the above requirements, as well as further psychiatric evaluations.  They should be urged but not required to discuss the issue with their parent or guardian, and plans should be made with a doctor for future birth control solutions.  Anyone under 13 requesting an abortion must have parental consent.<br>  <br>  All women should be urged to discuss the pregnancy with the father of the child, but not required by law to do so.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I believe a woman has a right to her own body -- in a healthy relationship, the father should be made aware of the issue, and if a woman is comfortable with it, a part of the final decision.  But, the overall choice goes to the woman -- after all, it's her uterus, and her decision.|`|bticQDIhaa	"So, essentially, it will now be illegal for men to masturbate or for women to menstruate, since both sperm and egg carry the genome of Homo Spines."<br>  <br>  It's a terrible law, and I'm fully against it, but I'd just like to make one small point. A sperm and an egg each have 22 chromosomes, plus a sex chromosome (X or Y) for a total of 23 chromosomes. The "genome of Homo Sapiens" would therefore be 46 chromosomes (the combination of sperm and egg). <br>  <br>  That being said, hopefully this law will be struck down by the courts.|`|AA10057370	Local Chapters <br>  Our Purposes and Objectives <br>  Statements and Positions <br>  Educational Trust Library and Video Resource List <br>  North Dakota Teens for Life <br>  ND Abortion Statistics <br>  ND Laws concerning Life Issues <br>  Annual Educational Conference <br>  State Legislation <br>  Federal Legislation <br>  LEGISLATIVE ALERTS <br>  Pregnancy Support Services <br>  To make donations to NDRL <br>  Educational Projects <br>  Other Pro Life Resources <br>   Welcome to North Dakota Right to Life!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vision Statement<br>  <br>  The vision of the North Dakota Right to Life Association is that all vulnerable persons in our society are protected throughout the span of their lives from conception to natural death.

I personally feel that treating babies like cockroaches is wrong.<br>  <br>  But, maybe it's just me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: yeah, a thumbs down.

rU6nh42Eaa	Immaturity is kind of a trademark for teenagers.  Movies tend to exaggerate whatever characteristic groups of people have, so with teenagers, lack of maturity identifies them as teenagers.  I've been a high school teacher for years, and I don't think teenagers have become more (or less) mature.  They seem to try to get into the roles of people who are older, but that's not the same as being in mature situations.  If I see that a majority of teenagers look at their education as their main occupation and their families as their center of socialization and responsibility, then I will think they are more mature today.|`|01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	No offense, but I think all teenagers in teen movies are portrayed as immature.

The Father gives the word to the Son and the Son gives it to the Spirit of Truth which is a Holy Angel/Spirit/Ghost.<br>  <br>  John 16:7,13-15<br>  7Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. <br>  13Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. <br>  14He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. <br>  15All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.<br>  <br>  This is Jesus telling you that after he leaves to go back to heaven, he will communicate with you through his Holy Spirit(Angel).<br>  <br>  Revelation 1:1-2<br>  1The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: <br>  2Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. <br>  <br>  Revelation 22:13-21<br>  13I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. <br>  14Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. <br>  15For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. <br>  16I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. <br>  17And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. <br>  18For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: <br>  19And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. <br>  20He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. <br>  21The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.<br>  <br>  Feel free to email with questions. Gabriel is the Spirit of Truth|`|AA11713693	Same thing but worded differently.|`|tManvxfQaa	the one word...its the Holy Ghost.....but today's people have become so dignified they refuse to use the term Ghost ..and say Spirit instead...|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	I thought they were the same - i refer to Holy Ghost sometimes rather than Spirit, but i believe i'm talking about the same person.<br>  <br>  The older translations refer to Holy Ghost and more modern refer to Holy Spirit.<br>  ~~~~<br>  <br>  Paula where is the poster who said they were different?|`|0vmQNf0oaa	The word Spirit is sometimes translated Ghost. It is the same Greek word though, "pneuma."|`|k7FD3rt5aa	The same!<br>  <br>  It is God in activity as Spirit.|`|VlWgZ9unaa	its just different wording but it's the same thing. =)|`|GAHFiIqSaa	The Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit are one and the same. This is the entity that is given to the saint at the time of the resurrection. You can see this phenomena when viewing artwork that depicts the saints. The halo in art represents the Holy Spirit/Ghost.<br>  <br>  You can see an image of these beings on the cover of the book at the link below.|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	No one knows exactly why the King James translators chose to use the term Holy Ghost 88 times and Holy Spirit 4 times in the New Testament. All the other major translations use Holy Spirit exclusively, and both terms come from exactly the same Greek words.<br>  <br>  Since in our time, the word ghost usually calls to mind an apparition, or visual representation of a dead person, and since the Holy Spirit is is not now nor has He ever been dead, most prefer to use Holy Spirit when referring to the third person of the Trinity.|`|P8WAKaWBaa	Hi Paula,<br>  There will be many people that are confuse and they will try to confuse others as well learn to stand your ground...The Holy Spirit (the comforter, our guide, and our teacher) is the same as the Holy Ghost...I prefer to say the Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  SMILE :) Prayerfully I helped ya|`|Kp9YusZIaa	they r the exact same thing. the holy ghost is when God gives u the ability to speak in tounges. its his HOLY SPIRIT inside of u.|`|bI3areCsaa	No difference.Jesus did not use the words Holy Spirit.He said "Holy Ghost."|`|6lJuKKMHaa	No.  He is Spirit.|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	Yes, that person is right, they're both different words.|`|VzIWDuRzaa	Means the same, God Bless|`|no3R6AFzaa	The Holy Ghost is a Christian term that is used to describe their belief in one of the three forms of God as in Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  The term "Ghost" has picked up some bad connotations in the way that is sounds as compared to seeing ghosts or to the occult.  Some people just think is sounds bad so they prefer to use the term Spirit.  There is however belief in a holy spirit that is different than the Christian personage of the Holy Ghost and that is what they were probably referring to.  Where the Christians believe that God is split or in three different personages others believe that the holy spirit is actually the love or energy that is God and is a part of us and that is a holy spirit not an actual Ghost type personage.  <br>  Might be a little confusing but I hope this helps.|`|1QPYDlj3aa	As has been said above, it's the same thing. The translation just differs, as does many things in the Bible. I notice the biggest "separation" in which Christian groups use which. I'm a Roman Catholic, and I use Holy Spirit, as do most other Catholics. Most Protestants use the Holy Ghost. Matter of preference. :-)|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	The Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit are one and the same, just different terms.   <br>  <br>  He is also called the Comforter, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ, Emmanuel...|`|yugLcDE2aa	They are One and the same the third person of the Godhead.|`|3d97cedda0f936e37048a4e1d413a7f8aa	the name of call. exactly, they are one.|`|XdrThYipaa	It is the same thing|`|Hup47cX4aa	They're the same thing according to the Bible.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|jxHIMep8aa	One word.|`|Xb0GiTMuaa	It's the same thing.|`|SY3pOi5waa	nothing,different name but means the same thang
rkhXCiIBaa	The gospel of Luke says he was placed in a manger after he was born, but it doesn't say where the birth itself took place. Earliest Christian tradition said that he was born in a cave, as did Justin Martyr, and Byzantine artworks depict it this way. The idea that he was born in a stable seems to be a fairly modern idea.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	He was born in a stable in a manger-  a feeding tough|`|AA12194228	He was born in a stable, I don't think there were hostels then. <br>  She then laid him in a manger.|`|bOiAHI8paa	manger.|`|lVKwnFvjaa	In a stable with a manger (a feed bin) for a crib.|`|4MLtp9g1aa	Try stable.|`|FUVoy02Uaa	Neither, it was a stable or a manger|`|SY3pOi5waa	um....duh he was born in a manger!
upF3zojpaa	they're jealous cuz you guys are literally 1 in a million|`|cicyiuiXaa	Guys are more inclined like red heads because they are more rare than regular brown and blonde heads.

But I don't like Blondes either.|`|yD6epwbbaa	yes  because of there annoying personality|`|8afcce307d873a5ec05e82bd377fada8aa	they dont like anyone who's different.<br>  <br>  I have a theory that most (white) people look down on them because they all want to be tanned and brown, and the redhead reminds them of their pale and pasty celtic roots. I think that's why they get picked on. <br>  <br>  As a non-white person I dont care! I think redheads are the coolest!!|`|q9PVawNyaa	I slag off my red headed friends doesn't mean I don't like them. Nobody actually dislikes red heads it's just an easy point to rip the piss.
jdKTs3aHaa	I know. I find it very direspectful because to me it's like they're comparing fruits at a fruit stand. I think it's an insult to both groups.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Take it easy.<br>  You are absolutely right.<br>  There are some gross historical similarities, in the sense that both groups have been persecuted for simply being different.<br>  And, since they are also large and high profile portions of the population, they come in for simplistic comparisons.<br>  <br>  But, to anyone that even scratches the surface of the history of these groups, the similarities are immediately overwhelmed by the differences.<br>  <br>  It really comes down to lazy thinking, IMO.<br>  <br>  Lina H needs to read a little more history, since she is buying into the same stereotypes that would offend her if they were aimed a black people.<br>  Also, the Jewish captivity by Egypt lasted LONGER than 400 years. And the people who comprised the Jewish population of the time were Caucasian, not African.<br>  So she is wrong on all points.|`|5rzhIOOaaa	i think people do this to explain persecution.  Blacks and jews were persecuted on the global scale, much larger than any other group of people.  Jews have experienced blatant racism for many years, ranging from the Roman diaspora of Jews, to the holocaust in WWII.  Blacks were the largest source of slaves for over 400 years.  Through the triangular trade, Africans were shipped to the Carribean, North and South America, and to many regions of Europe to work as servants or on plantations.  So overall, i think they are often compared because they have both experienced global scale persecution.|`|Tq8VZzCcaa	Yea the Jews were basically killed and starved.<br>   Blacks were worked to death used raped and after slavery tortured.<br>  Not to much light in any of these past. One gets used and abused the other just gets straight up put on the brink of annihilation|`|jJxUCkkFaa	They share a common history  of oppresion and both groups have diasporas.There are Black Jews such as the Beta Israel(Ethiopian Jews ), and other groups and individuals|`|NEWR4XNtaa	Why do people think the Holocaust and slavery were the only things to happen in the world in terms of ethnic persecution?<br>  <br>  Is everyone seriously that ignorant?<br>  <br>  First of all, the United States is not the only country of the planet. And that is not the only place where blacks LIVE. <br>  <br>  Secondly, SLAVERY has existed since the beginning of human history, long before the triangle trade. It has probably happened to every conceivable people, class, ethnicity, religion, WHATEVER. Do you honestly think slavery was invented just for Africans? <br>  <br>  Jews have also been slaves, and they've been persecuted since the beginning. The holocaust is extremely sad, (as is slavery in the Americas!) but honestly, these are not the only two events history should be concerned about.<br>  <br>  p.s. I apologize if I was too passionate in writing this, I was just fueled by whoever posted before about "fake jews". ******* idiot.|`|I9wb1Gc2aa	JEWS did NOT go through over 400yrs of slavery,<br>  In fact Jews were rich before and after the Holocaust<br>  <br>  If they are referring to the jews in the past(during biblical times) those people were Black, not the white jews we see today. The ones seen today are just a mixture of black and white. I consider them white and i consider them the fake jews|`|4Vmlf902aa	My friend is a black and mexican jew, so yes they've had contact.

EmOnt7FIaa	Filipino's are Mongoloids and are more related to the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans than they are related to the Pacific Islanders. The Pacific Islanders are Australoid and are a completely different race.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	asians!!!!|`|56dfvnwmaa	In my opinion asian|`|ry2XcFm6aa	I got the answer to this.....this is gonna be long so read and learn peeps...<br>  <br>  These 4 are the indigenous people of the Philippines who defined the identity of Filipino Race: <a href="http://img27.imageshack.us/my.php?image=4wavesskulls2714x405.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img27.imageshack.us/my.php?image=...</a><br>  <br>  look at the link before reading what's under:<br>  <br>  First wave were the Negritos (Afro- Asiastic/Melanesians) aka the Black Filipinos. These are the original Filipinos since they were the first ones to step in P.I. they are small in population. approx. 30,000.<br>  <br>  Second wave were the Malayo Polynesians which are closely related to the people of Polynesians today. "Majority of Filipinos are Malayo Polynesians (sub group of Austronesians.)" also majority of people from Southeast Asia are Malayo Polynesians.<br>  <br>  Third were the Indic Arabic influence. <br>  <br>  Last are the Spanish. the ones who gave us names with no meanings. Only 3-4% of Filipinos have Spanish blood aka Mestizos.<br>  <br>  if there's an approx of 90 million Filipino population then there are 3.6 million Mesitzos (Filipinos with Spanish blood) since they are 4% of population....that's ALOT.....<br>  <br>  - Of course we have alot of other mixed people in P.I. since other ethnic groups such as the Europeans, Chinese, Americans etc. form the P.I. population. --> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_grou...</a><br>  <br>  you mix all of these then you get Filipino. Filipinos are genetically mixed we can go from really dark to really light come in different shades.<br>  <br>  - We are Asians since P.I. is in Asia but majority of us aren't really related to the East Asians unless they're mixed. Plus just by our language...our language came from Austronesian language (Malayo Ploynesian languages) if you type Austronesian or Malayo Ploynesian...Philippines would appear.....I think it'd be confusing grouping Filipinos with the japanese, koreans and Chinese. <br>  <br>  That's why many Asians (East Asians) don't consider us one of them becasue they know...we are different from them in so many ways. <br>  <br>  - The thing about this... people are so confused because westerners have this notion about what asians should look like (the East Asians).....<br>  <br>  - our ancestors genetically resemble the look of pacific Islanders that's one more reason why peeps get confused. <br>  <br>  - East Asians are different from South East Asians...our ancestors came from Asia so therefore we are Asians....<br>  <br>  <br>  - People think I'm Hispanic too...but I always have to tell them I'm Fili...|`|9VsVJ7djaa	300 years of oppression by Spain produced an asian with a mexican or latino look. Its not easy to be good-looking like us. My great, great, great granddad was of spanish blood thats why when I travel to another country, some have mistaken me from a mexican or a south american latino.|`|BWt4mj13aa	Asians.

IpD4VhnCaa	Omg, I know what you mean! Now a days, being bisexual is like the new fashion movement or something...It's annoying how a girl that has kissed another girl only once before calls herself bi. It's just plain annoying. D=<|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	Sounds like society is finally heading in a positive direction, and homophobia is slowly disappearing.  But actually society never had a problem with bisexual women.  I think the success of "Basic Instinct" showed the world just how supportive our homophobic society is towards bisexual women.  I doubt you have as many openly gay men in your class or your brother's class.  Society seems to share their homophobia solely against gay men.  Amen.|`|YlMR42agaa	Yea i hate them ....did you look at the tyra show?<br>  <br>  they have a new name it's called bar-sexual.......pathetic huh?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p9og0KFmMo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p9og0KFm...</a><br>  <br>  Their not bi there whore's looking for attention<br>  I hate that!|`|iX2g7dTeaa	testosterone rush<br>  <br>  all of them are getting it<br>  <br>  they aren't really bi<br>  <br>  it's hormones<br>  <br>  people didn't used to act on it, but now<br>  <br>  They are comfortable|`|FHLKpNv4aa	Im in high school and a lot of them just want attention.Which makes my mum notbelievee me that im a lesbian.They are like barsexuals|`|AA11147988	i think becasue girls are more comftable with other girls. and think that being with another girl they wont get hurt|`|UrNfjq5Paa	We are taking over the world!!! muah hahah!<br>  <br>  Joking...posers...|`|RYCMFLMuaa	not enough  guys|`|x6Ffq0G8aa	Because men watch porn.

It's also one of those trendy things.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	There have always been college lesbians. I guess it has merged down to high school now. Generally, it's just for show and many of them end up straight once they grow up a bit. Of course, there are legitimate bisexuals and lesbians, but I can guarantee that half of your class is not this way.|`|KBBonf97aa	Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, even though the vast majority of the girls who do this are completely straight.  Some of them are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex crushes are normal during adolescence, but they're also temporary.  So they "decide" to be bisexual, rather than waiting until their hormone levels normalize and their true orientation makes itself clear.<br>  <br>  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who identified as bisexual in high school grew up to be happily heterosexual.  "Playing lesbian" allows them to satisfy their curiosity and test their boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.  Treating sexual orientation as a fashion statement actually makes life much harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and then discard when it's no longer in style.  If it weren't considered hip to be bisexual, you can bet none of the little girlies would even be considering it.|`|687xtC3zaa	It's all Katy Perry's fault. That unholy, ungodly whore who is corrupting the minds of our children with her sin music. </sarcasm><br>  <br>  Seriously, more people are becoming tolerant of other people in today's society. If someone wants to experiment, they just give themselves the label of "bisexual".|`|UtND0R2Baa	It's a lot more acceptable than it used to be so people are more comfortable coming out. People are also quicker to say they're bisexual when they're just curious when it doesn't have the same consequences.|`|7wqIJbPjaa	uhhh where are all of these girls?? lol. jk. <br>  <br>  it's the new "in" thing to do, didnt you hear?? <br>  <br>  a bunch of attention grabbing sexuality faking little...ooo sorry excuse me. hahaha.|`|wvJxtmJTaa	They are trying to fit in or be "cool"

She went into the kitchen all by herself, saw a half watermelon that was sliced the long way.  She wanted a slice.  It didn't occur to her that the melon had come from the store sliced that way.  She thought that someone at the cabin had sliced it that way.  Not wanting to appear stupid, she cut herself a slice, cutting the long way.

b3TljD0Laa	One of the "steps in writing" that I learned in school is sentence fluency, and I'm guessing that's what your teacher wants. Transitions are words like next, first, second, third, finally, etc. etc... So to show chronological order and to create more organization, you should add more of those. Here are some more transitions:<br>  <a href="http://www.class.uidaho.edu/adv_tech_wrt/resources/sentence_style/transitions_words.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.class.uidaho.edu/adv_tech_wrt...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

E71jweytaa	that means you like getting attention|`|KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for girls to experience same-sex attractions that don't have anything to do with what will ultimately become their sexual orientation.  It has everything to do with hormones and nothing to do with sexuality, in most cases.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, even though most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that it's normal to experience same-sex crushes, but that those attractions usually vanish when hormone levels normalize.  The hipness of "playing lesbian" actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used and tossed aside by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity and test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that's will probably only confuse you more.  Any human being can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, regardless of gender.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he sleeps with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them, but that has no bearing on orientation.  Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself completely clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why there are so many kids who think they're bisexual in high school, but very few people who don't identify as either straight or gay once they're in their 20s or older.  <br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with hormones.  And she's the first to admit she wouldn't have labeled herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always been attracted to guys and the attractions to girls started during adolescence, odds are you're completely straight and just going through something that has tormented girls for centuries.  Sexual orientation always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient, since you don't get to choose your orientation, anyway.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|pZfW9Mazaa	The only way to know if you are truly Bisexual, is if you would marry either a guy or a girl.<br>  <br>  Some people go to a club, kiss a girl, and then consider themselves bi but thats giving Bis a bad name.<br>  <br>  Being bisexual is about true love.

Mnm35sjNaa	If it's a black person you're trying to save, you better HOPE they don't know what's in the Book of Mormon!!  The following true story should explain exactly what I mean . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|jdRKZe18aa	People are saved through Jesus Christ - NOT through the Book of Mormon.  But you knew that one.... ; )|`|WyICbuPqaa	Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham and Elijah all lived before the Book of Mormon was written, and before the New Testament was written.  I believe that each of them could be considered "saved" by any definition.  They may not have confessed the name of Jesus, but they looked forward to the day when the son of God would come down from heaven and atone for the sins of mankind.<br>  <br>  To live with God in the highest of his kingdoms requires a person to be sinless.  The gospel is God's plan of progression to that sinless state.  Faith, repentance, baptism, subjecting ourselves to the Holy Ghost; these are the basic principles of the gospel, and of progression.  We apply these principles over an over to our lives, remembering the sacrifice or our savior, and his love for us.  Through the atonement of Jesus Christ and through the Holy Ghost we can become perfect.  The Book of Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel.  Each of the pieces are there, and through the study of its pages, one can assemble them into the perfect whole.  I have done just that - the gospel is beautiful and logical and makes perfect sense to me.  My life have been blessed overwhelmingly by the knowledge contained in the Book of Mormon.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	i believed i was saved as most people do<br>  without it, however baptism is argued that it needs to be done by authority and since the LDS church is the "restoration" of the christian church which is judged by God to be in apostacy, than everyone needs to be baptized in this church. <br>  <br>  however, there are degrees of salvation and being born again. <br>  <br>  i was born of the spirit before i even knew there was a mormon church. i was baptized in the spirit and mind and in the flesh by the spirit of the angel that appeared in my room, i say this all the time :P<br>  <br>  anyway. it is written somewhere that sometimes it does happen but noone can get the gift of the holy ghost without the laying on of hands.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Absolutly.  <br>  <br>  The Children of Israel, Christ's diciples, and the inhabitants of the Ancient Americas all heard God's word through prophets, yet none of them had access to the Book of Mormon.  <br>  <br>  To be saved, one needs to be baptized by the proper authority, then continue to repent of their sins throughout their lives and accept Christ's infinite atonement.  <br>  <br>  We are blessed to have access to more scripture now than any other time in history.  Perhaps our children will have more than we have today.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Like someone else said.<br>  Saved, yes.

Knowledge of what's in those books isn't enough, BELIEF in what's in those books is what's important.<br>  <br>  Can someone be saved without a belief in what's in those books?  According to Mormons, yes.  We believe all will be resurrected and rewarded according to the good they have done.  However, we believe the Bible and Book of Mormon offer something more (the gospel of Jesus Christ) that, if believed AND followed, can merit a person even greater reward and blessings.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	The Church says that all that is required is faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost.  Nothing about the Book of Mormon or being Mormon.  A person may come to have faith in Jesus Christ and repent of their sins even after death.  If a person has not received the ordinances, they will be done by proxy on their behalf.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	We are ALL saved by the grace and merits of Jesus Christ.

Exalted, no.|`|bi3XdkMEaa	Yes, almost everybody can be saved without knowing the BoM or the Bible.|`|W9uEeFFsaa	Probably (unsure)|`|kFC4ug3baa	As a Mormon, I do not believe that if you're not a Mormon you're going to hell.  The bible is a very important book of scripture and cannot be overlooked.  However, when King James edited it and different editions were created, bits of truth and knowledge were lost or distorted.  We believe that the Book of Mormon is another Testament to the divinity of Christ.  I've read it many times and inside is inspiration I have yet to find elsewhere.  No matter what is going on in my life, I can read in the pages and find an answer to my prayers, or the comfort I need.  Anyways, getting back to your question.  Being saved is a matter of actions and living righteously.  The book of Mormon has more instruction on this matter than any other book I know besides the bible, but you are not condemned if you do not read it.  I would advise you to read it.  Moroni chapter 10 says: " And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."  Good luck in your search for the truth, and God bless you.  ;-)

Z20AjHw1aa	Yes, you are right it is a choice whether we forgive or not, however I do not believe it is easy.  I had to forgive someone who left my brother for dead, it took me a few years to completely forgive the man who did this (especially as he walked away a free man from court).  <br>  <br>  To be able to forgive someone is actually a liberating and powerful victory over the criminal who has wronged so many people.  I believe that only God can help us to truly forgive others, in our own strength I believe it is not possible.  Only He can permanently heal our pain. To live with bitterness, anger and retribution is much more harmful to the person who lives with the  pain and agony of a hideous crime such as this.  I will not however ever be able to forget what happened as it has had a massive impact on our whole family, our lives have been profoundly effected ever since.<br>  <br>  I hope that this man will one day be genuinely sorry for his actions and have prayed that hopefully this will happen. One of the things I did, was to pray blessings for this man for several weeks.  Only when I did this, did I experience absolute freedom from the memory and genuinely wanted this man to be forgiven.   If he never repents, then I have faith to completely trust that God will deal with it and that justice will be done.|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	I would be very mad at first and then I would want revenge.

F38rqV07aa	The first thing I'd mention is that Hera, the Goddess, appears in Marvel Comics:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera_(Marvel_Comics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera_(Marve...</a><br>  <br>  and in DC comics:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_of_the_Gods_(comics)#Paradise_Lost.21" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_o...</a><br>  <br>  So there really is no better comparison to Hera than Hera Herself.<br>  <br>  But short of somebody omnipotent like a Greek god, I'd probably go with Mystique ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystique_(comics)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystique_(c...</a> ). She is morally ambiguous, at times motherly, deceptive, and jealous, and very feminine when she wishes to be.<br>  <br>  Mystique's power of shape-shifting is also a classic tool the Greek gods used to get what they wanted from mortals. Take the following excerpt from the Wikipedia article on Jason ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason#The_Early_Years" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason#The_E...</a> ), for example:<br>  <br>  "Many years later, Pelias was holding games in honor of the sea god and his alleged father, Poseidon, when Jason arrived in Iolcus and lost one of his sandals in the river Anauros ('wintry Anauros'), while helping an old woman (the Goddess Hera in disguise), to cross."<br>  <br>  She also does not age, thus she is immortal by definition (she lives forever and does not decay). From one of the articles above: "... her natural aging process has been suppressed (if not completely halted), as she has retained her youthful appearance despite being alive for over one hundred years."<br>  <br>  She is a feminist and motherly, and it actually turns out she is gay. From the same article: "Former X-Men writer Chris Claremont had originally stated that he intended for Mystique and Destiny to be Nightcrawler's biological parents (with Mystique having morphed into a man), but Marvel didn't agree, because at that time, gay or bi characters were not allowed. Much later, the two were later confirmed to be a couple."<br>  <br>  She is quite literally two-faced. In fact she is infinite-faced. She is whoever she needs to be.

AA11307468	I'm not interested in female superiority or male superiority.

AA11906603	I don't think that "good" and "bad" Muslims can be thrown into the categories of Sunni and Shiite. The Muslims in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey are Sunnis. Most of them are not terrorists. The Muslims in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia are also Sunnis - though most of them are pretty secular. The young women mostly dress like Westerners, except perhaps for people who live in extremely rural villages. They are not terrorists. Shiites live in Iran, and so on. Kurds are Sunnis and Turks and Iraqis don't like them.<br>  <br>  The are a few problems that are much more important than the Sunni/Shiite split. A lot of Muslims (not all) live in countries where the leaders are totally corrupt dictators and the Mullahs are ignorant uneducated tyrants. They keep their own people in poverty - down and powerless in the dark by telling them to obey a bunch of "rules" that were never in the Koran. In this case, religion has been perverted for power.<br>  <br>  Also, Islam is a younger major religion than the rest. Christian history is very bloody and violent if you go back 500 years all the way back to the Crusades. Islam will probably reach a more tolerant and cooperative level in a few hundred years. Meanwhile, if you want to sample some of the best mystic teachings of Islam, pick up a book of Rumi's poems. You won't be disappointed.|`|AA11586837	A "Few" make it "Bad" for the "Many".<br>  <br>  now, from what I have been Told:<br>  <br>  Shiites---Rhymnes with "you Know What!".<br>  <br>  SXXX (what-ever)<br>  <br>  and should be Flushed Down "The Tubes"!!! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  BALANCE is the KEY to LIFE<br>  <br>  and don't you Ever Forget It Either,  Kid!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Balance!<br>  See?|`|GItBUBL9aa	I think bin Laden is a Sunni Muslim, and groups like Hezbollah are Shiites.  But the branch of Sunni that particularly attacts terrorists is the Wahhabi branch of that sect. Bin Laden is from that branch that began in the 1800's in Saudi Arabia.  It was the Saud family who united the Arabian penninsula through violence, following the Wahhabi teachings.  The Wahhabi movement teaches the speading of Islam through violent means, following the Quran's teachings to kill those who will not convert.<br>  <br>  So, there are more dangerous elements withing the Islamic sects, and it seems a lot of the terrorists come from both sides.  The president of Iran is a Shiite.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	There have been known instances of Shiite bombings. <br>  <br>  This does NOT, however, justify calling all Shiite Muslims terrorists. Sunnis are the majority of world Muslims by far.<br>  <br>  There are SOME Shiites and Sunnis who don't like each other.

NEWR4XNtaa	Mike, you are an idiot.<br>  <br>  An African-American, or European-American, is no more American than an Arabian-American or any other American. There are more than black and white people in this country. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, "American" is not a race, it's a nationality. The many differences between us (I assume you mean people from the United States) and people from Iraq are vast, it's hard to sum them all up in a single answer. It is even more difficult considering there are even greater differences between the Iraqi's and between the Americans themselves, so you can't really generalize.<br>  <br>  But, overall, I would say the major differences would be our language, obviously most people here speak English, and we are generally a (even though I'm not) Christian culture, and they are generally an Islamic culture. While tons of little differences of course exist ;P<br>  <br>  Or, perhaps, I have misunderstood your question. If you are asking "are we worth more than an Iraqi?" as a rhetorical question to try and undermine the war, then I will answer as follows: No. A life is a life, they are equal. Us being more "civilized", which of course is debatable, does not make us more valuable. What we are doing there blows, and we should leave ASAP.|`|5HPkIxZHaa	well you are different from an iraqi because your dark skinned and iraqis are white skinned|`|W1GHZW3Caa	we have lighter skin color or way darker

AA12006309	No, they're just doctors.  They don't associate your girlybits with a sexual act when they're examining you, they're examining you as a doctor would, intellectually, analytically.  That's like saying all male gynecologists are sex predators, just so they can stick their hands in a girls cooch.  It's just not the case.<br>  <br>  Her reasonings for wanting to be a gynecologist can be anything.  Perhaps she wants to get into obstetrics and deliver babies.  Maybe she grew up with a gynecological problem and wants to help others.  The reasons are myriad.

I thought it raised alot of good issues we as black women need to address, from anger issues to issues of abandonment from our real fathers that put us into a cycle of tearing down our own black men because our fathers abandoned us or the opposite direction of looking for a sort of Daddy figure in the wrong men.  Although some of the directors assertions are ridiculous. Many of them are valid and made me really think as a black woman. Like when he said it's not about the white woman, it's about black womens inability to notice a good man when she has one, to not complain about the little things to uplift our men and not try to stifle him and his manhood, to just let him be the man sometimes and take care of us and do the same for him. It also highlights the old letting our friends dictate or relationship. Overall it's a must see for black women in america. Plus the leading man is fine, lol<br>  <br>  Edit: I asked my brother (a black man) his thoughts on this. He said that above all a man wants to come home and be at peace, he views his home as a fortress from the harsh realities of being a black man in this world. He needs his woman to love him and need him on an emotional level. He is dating a nigerian woman right now and he feels that most black-american women he has dated (not all he says), had left him with a dreading of coming home for fear of what argument they would get into for that day, he says they did not support him in his endeavors and would leave him when times got tough. He tried dating non-black women and found that he just didn't feel complete without a black woman on his side. So he started dating african or black women from other countries and has not looked back since.|`|tusCN8zpaa	Wow. Yeah I really wouldn't take in a homeless man, and I wouldn't be working my butt off while my lazy man is living at home, your father's stupid, I wish my man would (Sarcasm), she's getting taken advantage of... And I would get with a man that had a record, only depends on what crime it was and why he did it. Ask  me something, would you do this stuff?

So your general conclusions are not valid.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Black women  want a man with a job, no jail record?? You mean they want a man with no job and a criminal record because that seems to me that's all they date.. It does seem when i was down on my luck the non-black women would stick by my side and give me confidence to do better which i did while- black women complained about why i wasn't doing good in life and just bailed on me until i started doing good then started coming around again. But for me i usually date non-black women, they seem more approachable then black women and more peaceful to be around..

k1vdbpixaa	Any time something close to your heart is attacked, it caused pain and anger. Other animals would duke it out physically.  We humans have the ability to reason, and since we can't draw swords online, we counter with words.<br>  The Bible says that the tongue is like a sharp sword, and can do a lot of damage.  We should remember that even though we are passionate about our beliefs, we should not attempt to use our words to belittle or provoke.  The Bible also says that words of a Christian will offend those who don't believe, so there's nothing we can or should do about that.  When God's words reaches them, conviction takes place, and they have the choice to respond or reject that conviction.  Rejection of the Holy Spirit often produces bitterness and anger.  Not to say that Christians don't get angry, but when our anger represents the defense of the gospel against the anger of a disbelieving soul, we see the "offense" the Bible speaks to, and this is what can and often causes the problems around here.  SO....<br>  Since the purpose of this venue is to discuss religion and spirituality, we are bound to have conflict.  As long as we can keep the banter respectable, without name-calling and insults, it's a pretty neat site. <br>  And "I'm sorry, please forgive me" are words that can heal, and should be used a lot more around here.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Hum yes I have looked at it that way and just find anger and hatred and<br>  more hate than there is love

LuN1unJ3aa	Shinto is considered to be the native religion of Japan (at least where it was dominant for many years). The wikipedia article is pretty good, so I've included it in the sources. The following are the first three paragraphs from that source and will give you a good idea about the connections. I strongly recommend pulling up the wikipedia articles.<br>  <br>  Shinto is the Japanese religion and was once its state religion. The earliest extant record of its existence is in the Kojiki of 712. It is a polytheistic and animistic faith, and involves the worship of kami, or spirits. Some kami are local and can be regarded as the spiritual being/spirit or genius of a particular place, but others represent major natural objects and processes; for example, Amaterasu (the Sun goddess), or Mount Fuji.<br>  <br>  The earliest Japanese sources do not refer to a unified religion. The word Shinto was borrowed from the Chinese, combining two kanji: "shin" (compound words use Chinese pronunciation, hence shin not kami), meaning gods or spirits; and "tō", meaning a philosophical way or path (originally from the Chinese word dao). As such, Shinto is commonly translated as "The Way of the Gods." Some differences exist between Shintoism (the ancient Shintō) and the many types of Shinto taught and practiced today, showing the influences of Buddhism when it was introduced into Japan in the sixth century.<br>  <br>  Shinto is no longer Japan's official state religion. However, it is considered the native religion of Japan. While some Shinto practices and teachings were given a great deal of prominence during World War II, they are no longer taught or practiced today. There are others, though, that still exist as commonplace activities, such as omikuji (a form of fortune-telling) and the Japanese New Year to which few people give religious connotations. Important national ceremonies such as coronations and imperial marriages are conducted at the Three Palace Sanctuaries in Tokyo.|`|yldVFIcXaa	The basic beliefs are a hundred times better than the basic beliefs of monotheistic religions - christianity, islam<br>  <br>  Shinto has a few basic ideals, respect towards your family, and respect towards nature.<br>  <br>  Buddhism isn't exactly a religion, rather a system of beliefs, there is no real god, just a set of teachings; there are 5 main teachings- to refrain from taking life, taking things which are not yours, refrain from sensual misconduct, refrain from lying and from relying on drugs/alcohol.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	what are the chances that an expert of Japanese relgions will see this question? pretty slim so i say hit up Wikipedia
6Z4fKZ8aaa	My mom doesn't like me wearing hijab or being Muslim.  But I don't care. I'll wear my hijab, abayas and niqab anyway. It's more important to guard my chastity and be modest and please Allah(SWT) then to listen to my Kuffar mother and remove my Islamic clothing.|`|DTFsNJxpaa	Well my Aunt and Uncle (who i'm living with) won't let me wear it, but i do it anyway. I don't wear it around my uncle because he's the one who has the big problem with it. But as soon as i get in the car to go anywhere i put it on then and then take it off before i come in. He knows i wear it, but he doesn't see me. Keeps the peace in the house between my Aunt and him, so i just do it that way. My advice is just to do that, because no matter what you are able to get around your dad not wanting you to wear hijab. And just think how much more reward you - or your sister- will be getting by still wearing it even though others are trying to stop her! Inshallah everything will play out well!|`|51892c12506b240500310aefa8daf61daa	I would have to disobey him because Allah commands the muslim woman to wear the hijab.<br>  You have to ask yourself, who's command is greater?<br>  <br>  There is no obedience to anyone in disobedience to Allah.<br>  <a href="http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=29&Topic=5810" rel="nofollow">http://www.salafitalk.net/st/viewmessage...</a>|`|qky7gWosaa	It's funny how parents don't take an interest in Islam but their children do.

A hijaab is a part of being modest and to label yourself as a believing woman to the out world... So my question is why would he not want this? He wants his daughter to show their private parts to others to see? Even your mother has left the hijaab because of him? Ya Allaah, if i was her, asking thalaaq is the least thing i would do, nobody comes and talk about my hijaab.. You accept it or you leave it alone, it isn't your decision, i wear it... <br>  <br>  Soebhan Allaah how many fathers are crying to let his daughter start the hijaab and leave this dunya (dating, gossiping etc) aside? How unthankfull is your father, for having 2 beautifull daughters that want to stay chaste?|`|4aveC2aaaa	well first, he wouldnt do that, hes too religious lol<br>  <br>  second, if he did go out of his way and not let me wear it, i would force HIM to wear it!<br>  <br>  put it on his head when hes sleeping then take pics and share with the world|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Wow. That's messed up. It's your choice. I wore the Hijab for myself, and I wouldn't change my decision one bit.<br>  <br>  Isn't it funny how everyone thinks women are oppressed to wear the Hijab?<br>  <br>  When I look at the some of the answers here, and your question, it makes me so mad that people who are misinformed about Muslim women in Islam, don't understand that the forcing a woman NOT to wear the Hijab and ill treatment of a Muslimah who wants to wear the Hijab is also considered oppression.<br>  <br>  Just like you can impose or force someone to wear the Hijab, you can also impose and force someone not to wear the Hijab. This is oppression in its double standards.|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	He didn't. He gave me such a hard time about it. I was already finding it the most difficult thing I've ever had to do and he added more pressure to that but I did it alhamdullilah. I understand what your sister went through but I thought about it realistically. Am I doing this for my dad? NO! I am doing it for Allah and for myself. If I take it off now, I will find an excuse to take it off later. If I took it off, I would've never worn it. So I decided to endure the pain.<br>  <br>  But now I've worn it for over a year, and my dad's gotten used to it now alhamdullilah. Thus proving my theory that no matter what hardships you go through, it will only get easier over time.|`|vwFf2ftcaa	My uncle whom I grew up with didn't want me to wear the hijab so I went ahead and wore a full blown hijab including Niqab.......he hated it.<br>  Tell your dad that you will be fine and you are following the Qur'aan InshaAllaah he will get the idea after he sees how determined you are.|`|Cugx9IXraa	hahaha <br>  <br>  yeah right!<br>  <br>  i'd probably wear a hoodie and i wouldn't go out as much

A congregation of about 200 people make up a ward. This is the group that you meet with every Sunday to worship together and it's lead by a bishop and his bishopric. There are about 10 wards to a stake and a stake is lead by a stake president. Then above stakes you have areas and area authority presidents. And above them you have the apostles and the prophet who is also the president of the church.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It is spelled "stake" and has references found in the Bible. Its use is not unlike a stake that is used to hold up and stabilize a tent.<br>  <br>  Within the LDS religion, it refers to a geographical area of the church.<br>  <br>  The smallest unit of the church is the family, followed by the ward or branch. The third unit is the stake (or mission where there are no organized stakes).

wPD3BGEHaa	The underworld is actually the equivalent of the after life to us, it's where all the newly dead souls go. There is a lot of debate on whether this is a heaven or hell. Most scholars believe that this may be hell, because hell was located under the earth.<br>  The god set ( the god of chaos)  was supposed to rule the underworld, Ra made his nightly journey through the underworld every night over a 12 hour period, after the 5th hour he dies and is reborn in the 12 as a scarab.<br>  <br>  DEVO: Sorry I made a mistake, I will strive in the future to be more perfect like you!!|`|dFBccLExaa	Sexy has it wrong. Set doesn't rule the underworld. <br>  Osiris rules the underworld, and it was Anubis who ruled it before him. <br>  You can find a lot about the process of getting to the underworld in "the book of going forth by day" otherwise known as the book of the dead. Commonly, the underworld is called the Field of Reeds in english.  In this world, it's basically a continuation of life. What you were in life, you would continue to be in the afterlife. It's a happy place (not anything like hell), as people of that stature are sent to Hamut, where their souls are eaten. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall04/Hilton/underworld.htm" rel="nofollow">http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall04/H...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aldokkan.com/religion/field.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aldokkan.com/religion/field.h...</a><br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|JU1yjxBqaa	i do belive that the underworld is the place that the egyptians would always pray to go because its the only place where thay could ever rule and be somthing great like a god and the reason i say that is because the underworld manipulates the mind so that it becomes your kingdom your world and in that world what u say is law. and thats what every ancient egyptian dreams of in their life to become the ruler of a kingdom and therefor their dreams and hopes of being sent to the underworld when the die are extreamly high. hope i helped!
vny0lYvwaa	If it was me I would take it up with the property manager of the building and explain your situation you could tell them you are concerned it will start a fire. Maybe they could put cigarette buckets out side away from your window.  I have seen them in other apt complexes.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Maybe they could send a letter out or posting in the entrance tenants explaining it could be a fire hazard to leave cigarettes in front of someone’s window etc.  They might not listen to you and you wouldn't want any angry neighbors.  <br>  <br>  If all else fails I would call the fire dept and have them possibly contact the landlord.  Tenants do have certain rights they should feel safe where they live.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|K9PmtBxkaa	tell them, and if they don't listen, just push the butts next to their apt everytime you find them. they'll get the hint.

That's nasty.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Maybe you could supply them with a butt can (maybe they are just being thoughtless and not intentionally rude) in hopes that they'll use it. Most smokers don't set out to be rude to non-smokers, but when treated as less than human, the less mature (and meaner) individuals will retaliate accordingly making things miserables for all parties involved. So, approaching the situation gently is more likely to yield good results than being rude because you think they are being rude. If you see that they are using the butt can, you can pick it up and move it to a more desirable place and hope that it stays there. Good luck!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Tell them straight-forward.

ArP1IILpaa	stop watching it , when u get the urge to watch it just do something else|`|ODdtZ06Qaa	are you a boy or a girl lol|`|uc9M9QFVaa	get a gf|`|zIjZhlysaa	Wow you've gotten some terrible answers!<br>  <br>  Well I can't imagine that a gay porn addiction is too much different from a straight porn addiction. If you only watch it every once in awhile then it probably isn't a problem. But if it takes up a constant chunk of your life here is what I can suggest<br>  <br>  1. Avoid going on your computer as much as possible, once you log on the harder it will be to resist it. <br>  2. Fill up your life with something outside the internet. Join a hobby group or hang out with friends more. Get yourself doing something that you are interested in and will keep you busy. So eventually it might help you forget about your addiction.<br>  <br>  And if you really keep obsessing about it, a therapist can help. This is a very common problem for people.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the only one who can stop the addiction is you. I wish you the best of luck!|`|zVFKk8eCaa	According to my psych teacher, watching some porn is healthy. It only becomes a problem when it begins to take up too much time and/or interferes with your daily life and relationships. If you feel that this is has become a problem you should try contacting your local hospital for the location of a Sexaholics Anonymous  support group or see a therapist.|`|fMkKDTo3aa	There's nothing wrong with watching porn, besides the guilt you might feel later, but, my best guess is that you simply distract yourself when you find the urge. Watch television or drink tea, if you're intent on stopping!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)<br>  <br>  (I've never actually done that, so I can't really help much....)|`|j2gtKnFdaa	Go to church. If you are Christian, it'll really help because you'll start to feel conviction. Have someone to fast and pray with you.<br>  <br>  First, don’t ever give up in your fight to be pure. <br>  The key to overcoming this addiction is perseverance. <br>  God will help you to persevere and help you all the more when you persevere. <br>  “God won’t forgive me–I’ve fallen to this sin countless times and don’t think I can stop.” <br>  This lie is Satan’s favorite.  God will certainly forgive you if you repent and ask him to.  Don’t believe the lies.  His mercy is greater than this lustful sin, period. <br>  “It’s not that bad.  Other men do far worse things than this.” <br>  Wrong.  It IS that bad.  You are degrading God’s beautiful daughters and the gift of sexuality he gave you.  And when you face God in your judgment, he won’t ask you if you did less worse things than your next door neighbor.  He will only ask what you have done, and you will have to answer for it. <br>  The same Satan who delights in torture, kidnapping, brutality, abortion, and abuse, delights in men lusting after women in pornography. <br>  “I can handle watching TV when I want, and even if I see some women in immodest dress or in sexual situations, it doesn’t really affect me.” <br>  Oh really?  If you’re like me, this just ain’t true. <br>  These images stick like glue in your mind and accrue, and inevitably those images will return to your mind and the seeds of temptation will be planted.  You are not as strong as you think you are.  The slightest temptation would overcome you if God did not help you, but he also requires we do our utmost to avoid these temptations.  Turn off the TV except for movies you know are clean or special programs you want to watch, and only with someone you trust close by. <br>  Pray everyday. <br>  Are you tempted in the morning while lying in bed?  Get up!  Immediately when you wake up, pray to our Blessed Mother:  “I pray for the grace to respect and protect all your daughters today, Blessed Mother.” <br>  Renew your resolutions to be pure throughout the day, and ask for the Holy Spirit to give strength to your resolutions. <br>  Thank God for giving you the grace to be pure at night. <br>  Make good friends who share in your beliefs and struggle against this manifestation of evil and spend time with them and your family. <br>  When the first tempting thoughts come into your mind, pray immediately for God to protect you and set your mind on another matter. <br>  If they persist, pray even more and keep trying to steer your mind to other things. <br>  Avoid idleness! <br>  If you feel a strong temptation, pray even more for help and grace, confess your weakness and nothingness to God, and your desire to be pure. <br>  If you are alone, go somewhere and meet up with friends or family, or go do something where you interact with people. <br>  Quickly go over in your mind why pornography and lust are evil, and why you do not want them. <br>  Make yourself accountable with a brother in Christ who also is striving to be pure. <br>  Pray with him, pray for him, everyday, and keep each other accountable for your actions. <br>  Within good judgment, tell him of your struggles and victories, and if you fall to temptation, let him know and ask for even more prayers. <br>  All of this is in addition to praying, receiving the Sacraments (if Catholic) and striving after God in your daily life. <br>  Finally, pray for hope in overcoming this addiction.  God CAN do it.  He can do anything and regularly works miracles in peoples’ lives who call upon him for help.  He has worked wonders in my life to overcome this addiction, and if he can do it in me, he can do it in you.  Satan wants you to despair, for when you despair, his work is made much easier, but our Lord never wants us to despair.|`|af2573e80b72732d3c14d9c37f1e1165aa	well if your gay it's not that bad<br>  porn and masturbation are perfectly normal<br>  but if your straight<br>  then you could try watching like normal sex or lesbian or something lol<br>  or you could just delete it all <br>  and if you keep yourself busy by like playing games or something <br>  you won't feel the need to watch it or jackoff or anything|`|RpJjDqg4aa	One word: Therapy<br>  this is something very few people could do on their own, a therapist is your best bet, many people have addictions and see therapists because of them and there is no shame in doing so, I stress the importance of getting professional help for this greatly|`|uQkLo6ZTaa	Take a vacation.

Any time you have a craving to go online and look at that sort of thing, turn the computer off and leave the house. Find some sort of activity to replace the addiction with. Physical exercise is usally very good for overcoming any sort of addiction. Go out jogging, go buy Dance Dance Revolution, go to the local gymn, relandscape your entire lawn. Never just sit in front of the computer and say "I'm going to try to not look at this sort of thing," because you are garunteed to look at it if you stay at the computer. Also, keeping friends around alot can help. It's alot less likely you're going to be looking at that stuff with others watching you. Therapists arn't a bad idea either.

yLZpsRg9aa	Salam!<br>  <br>  I Absolutely LOVE the Abaya! I swear you can wear WHATEVER you want under it whether it be shorts, pants, jeans,PJ's, and a long skirt.<br>  I dont wear the abaya to school only because...i just dont wanna haha. <br>  In the summer you can wear your abaya with some really cute flats and if ya want try those big sunglasses. <br>  in the winter wear the abaya with some boots sorta like this:: <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/cute%20black%20boots/saksoffender/TIANNA_BLACK-SUEDE_large.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/cute%...</a><br>  <br>  ((i have some like those))<br>  <br>  and just accessories it up!..but remain modest<br>  <br>  Aggghhh i hate giving fashion advice online=[<br>  dangit i wish you were here with me..so much easier!<br>  <br>  <br>  When i dont have my abaya on im usually wearing those long skirt and a cute nice loose fitting top and of course my hijab and also my flats(in the spring,fall, and summer)or sneakers and those boots ive showed above in the winter<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  i wear jeans with those tops that come down to your knees.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  kinda hard to explain online|`|4xENQVXvaa	If you're looking to dress modestly, without having to worry about what to wear every morning then yes, go for the abaya.<br>  <br>  Also, when you're out, you don't have to worry whether you're dressed appropiately to pray. You also won't have to really worry about men staring at your figure, that is, if the abaya is not fitted but is loosely worn. <br>  <br>  And one more thing, you can wear whatever you want underneath lol<br>  <br>  And it also reaches the ultimate type of modest clothing, which is simple, yet effective. *wink*|`|cPDX4VgVaa	Salaam sister... :)<br>  <br>  U see that's the problem with wearing normal and casual clothes, after wearing an abaya, u will never be able to find a more covering, suitable casual clothing. Sis, I firmly suggest u to wear a abaya. It is the most modest dress that's around, and u will be rewarded for wearing it to. Besides, u can relax about casual wears, once u wear an abaya.<br>  <br>  And, why are u saying that u have gone... :( Ur not planning on leaving permanently do u...? :(|`|gAyXKqIpaa	Abaya is better<br>  When i wear Abaaya i can where whatever i want underneath<br>  hehe eg: somedays i cant be bothered getting out of my pjs so with abaya no one sees :D<br>  Im lazy some days<br>  <br>  But if you want no abaya<br>  well its hard because everywhere is dominated by western culture<br>  long sleeve shirts stop about 10 inches and more from the wrists<br>  pants are tight<br>  skirts are tight around the hips<br>  <br>  agh so annoying<br>  but abaya is good for wearing anything and it keeps you warm too :D|`|uUAxK6hNaa	I wear all sorts, now in a maxi dress mode..

By wearing it, you are pleasing yourself and your Lord. <br>  <br>  I wear the abayah when I don't go to school. I just started wearing it regularly recently, and I enjoy it. If it's really hot, I don't wear a top underneath. I don't have to worry so much about what I'm wearing when I wear my abayah.<br>  <br>  When I don't wear it, I wear really loose tracksuit bottom and a loose top so my figure isn't really shown.<br>  <br>  It's hard to make sure you dress modestly sometimes when you don't wear the abayah. It's makes life much easier.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	All the women of my house wear Abaya and masha Allah they all look beautiful.

That's how you get to know someone before you get married anyway. <br>  <br>  You just can't have relations with them until you're married (the abstain from fornication part). That's all no biggie. It's a protection for all of us. Many parents try to teach their children to wait in that area of life like Jehovah is teaching us to do so now. We do our best to live by it. If your significant other is giving you a hard time about it I would seriously reconsider his respect for what's important to you. <br>  <br>  But don't be pressured or feel you have to rush. I'm glad you're enjoying your studies and I encourage you to continue. You'll make the right decision when you're ready. I'm sure of it. <br>  <br>  PS Don't miss out on the Keep yourselves in God's love book. There's all kinds of good info in there!!!! I've studied it on my own 3 times already and I love it!!!|`|5qjxyb0jaa	Continue on the narrow path you are now following , you do not need the advice of worldly people on this site , I know you will make the right choice as you are already thinking about it.<br>   Study , pray & fellowship through the meetings .|`|GEfUTyi8aa	well.... if you or your kids are ever in need of a blood transfusion to save your lives... say sia nora because if your JW no can do...... and anyone could get in an accident, get a disease and need this blood.... so be prepared to make that decision and say no... while you watch your kid or yourself die... and.... you will have to spread the word.... like get up early on weekends and go bug people about your great religion... get doors slammed in your face and such.... and when your kids go to school and they have christmas, holloween or any kind of party, they will have to be excused.... and trust me... that harms them... they feel really bad when they are kids and cant be like the other kids... my friend went through this and she still talks about it at 42.    I think you should really look into this faith before you join.. it is a cult..... big time.|`|HGPxEhMSaa	Good for you , i would encourage you to pray to Jehovah & talk with your study conductor , maybe even the elders .<br>   You have taken the first few steps to a better life & future .<br>   In all things put Jehovah first .<br>  <br>  You do understand baptism is not to be taken lightly , it is a public declaration that you are prepared to live the rest of your life as a true follower of God so do you not think all should understand what they are agreeing too .|`|cic4J2hzaa	i work with someone that is Jehovah witness. I disagree with some of the things they believe. For example.....When they say only 144,000 will make it into the kingdom and how that say celebrating Christmas and birthdays arent right, and they dont think heaven exist. They believe that it will be paradise here on earth. I dont have anything against them i just get upset when i hear taht they go door to door telling people something that is incorrect. When God clearly states that we are not to add nor to take away to his word. But yea...thats how i feel bout the whole situmawation :) Take care<br>  <br>  OH AND YES....ABOUT THE WHOLE BLOOD TRANSFUSION THINGY. I BELIEVE IF SOMEONE IS SICK THEN THEY SHOULD TAKE THERE MEDICINE THEREFORE IF THEY NEED A BLOOD TRANFUSSION THEY SHOULD GET IT. NOT SAYING THAT GOD ISNT BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE THAT NEEDS IT BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS FOR...YA KNOW? MY DAUGHTER HAD TO HAVE 2 BLOOD TRANSFUSSIONS...I COULDNT IMAGINE HAVING TO TELL THEM THEY COULDNT DO IT...YA KNOW?|`|AA11025703	Firstly, MANY on Y!A still classify Witnesses as a Cult.

3IVqoH16aa	I think God and parents are virtually the same thing up until a certain age.  It's striking how closely some people's belief about the nature of God, judgemental and punishing or loving and forgiving for example, resembles their parent's disposition.<br>  I think when we truly mature, our parents are no longer our world.  And we can develop our own ideas about the nature of God or the world.  We can see that our parents are our parents, real humans with quirks and imperfections that may be different from other people, God or the world.  But I think some people get stuck and never learn to separate parents from God.

If you are not a cristian I would understand, but to question your own religion? That just tells me that the 'supposed' christians really aren't christians. I believe that the bible is 100% true and should be taken seriously, and not taken as a joke as the 'supposed' take it. The bible means EXACTLY what it says. It was told by god, and god knows everything. I HATE how some people create jokes about god, the bible,etc. And create stories that are not true. Those might change the minds about the younger people out there who don't fully know or understand, the christian religion. Because if people start believing all those things that are said, our religion will be completely messed up and things will be confused between what is real and what is not about christianity.

They are human.  They are imperfect by nature)  That there are too many groups to choose from within Christianity- and I would probably never get "The right one".  Each group is finger pointing and screaming at each other about how ungodly the other one is.<br>  <br>  Each group has points on why the other group is going to hell- and none of them can back themselves up any better- since they ALL use the bible to back up their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Do you want unity?  Give a little leeway.<br>  <br>  That guy who says that "40 days and 40 nights"  might not actually be "40 days"  because in the ancient world "40" was slang for "many".

He married a white woman.<br>  <br>  His child was black.<br>  In an interview he was discussing how his little girl was acting up in a mall and throwing a tantrum.  He dedcided it was time to leave, but she was still screaming and throwing a fit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Two men stopped him.  It looked like this white guy was kidnapping a little black girl because she looked nothing like him.<br>  <br>  I am still very fair.  My husband is hispanic.  I am tall, while my hubby is short and stocky.  Our kids look NOTHING like him.. (little parts do, they are darker, have his eyes and nose- but body structure  they do not)<br>  <br>  At a school function, our 5 year old was tearing around and getting out of hand.  My husband was chasing him.  A police officer stopped him and asked if he needed anything.  <br>  It wasn't until our 14 year old who is an exact match to the 5 year old, walked up, called him dad, and picked up the 5 year old was when the police officer backed off.<br>  <br>  My 5 year old kindergarden teacher asked my husband if this was the 2nd marriage.

There are stories of this type all over the internet, although I could not find the one about the show I saw.<br>  <br>  Both of my parents are considered white, although my dad is 100% Italian. My sister got more of the Italian genes than I did but all three of her children are very light skinned with light brown hair and green or blue eyes.

0hsh000waa	That's everywhere, look at the realities shows in the U.S...<br>  Sure some black women are rude and "ghetto" but certainly not all and they make seem like every black woman is like that.<br>  <br>  The positive images aren't always of mixed race women we also have Michelle Obama, Queen Latifah, Oprah, Tyra Banks (she's not mixed race), Kerry washington, Sanaa Lathan, Jennifer Hudson, Jessica White, Oluchi Onweagba etc..|`|StRaKUf6aa	I agree.  It's difficult for black women to be taken seriously by society when every time we're in the popular media, we're portrayed as ghetto, obnoxious, unintelligent, loud, and rude.<br>  <br>  A note to the Oracle: Wake up.  There are plenty of good representations of black people but the WHITE MEDIA does not see fit to showcase these examples as much as the bad examples.  Why?  Because the bad examples of black people reinforce the ideals that most racist people already have about black people, thus they make more ratings.<br>  <br>  Did you know that there was going to be a show on VH1 that centered around intelligent black women with professional careers but the idea was scrapped because the producers decided that it wasn't such a bankable idea?  Apparently, no one cares to watch black women behaving in a presentable manner.  We're only viewed when we're acting a plum fool.<br>  <br>  There is plenty of good black music out there, but what gets picked up by all the big companies?  The crap.  Yet the entire group gets blamed for it instead of the big companies who pimp it out for their own gain.<br>  <br>  I'm tired of people like you saying "Black people need to change their act" when obviously there are just as many different types of black people as there are white people.  The difference with white people, however, is that they all have such a wide, diverse array of personalities displayed throughout the media it's difficult for someone to point at a white person and yell out a stereotype.  For black people on the other hand, sense we only get ONE representation, everyone always relies on that to stereotype ALL of us by.<br>  <br>  It's unfair and the media needs to change.|`|XimcTAFpaa	wow in the UK too?<br>  <br>  I thought America just do that.<br>  <br>  Like they had this ghetto black women with purple hair tell a muslim women that she is afraid of them and didn't feel safe...which hurt the muslim womens feelings!! I was so angry!! I don't want that lady leaving thinking black women are like that and hate them!! I think there wonderful people!|`|z93tSvKxaa	No, I do not think so.  The question is why do black women and men continue to perpetuate those stereotypes just to make money?  If you want people to think differently of you then YOU should change your own images. Look at your local rap video or other black music video. Where is the classy black woman?  Where is the self-respecting black man?  The blacks that do have decent videos with self respect their own people do not patronize it.  Look at how blacks go nuts over Beyonce.  But she acts like a h0e.  The rapper is a thug.  However blacks said that "The Cosby Show" was not an ideal black show.  So the problem is not white america but BLACK AMERICA.  You go to any black ghetto and you will see some black gals acting like that.  <br>  <br>  You walk thru the mall who will you see being loud and ignorant some black chick or a hispanic chick and occasionally some fillipino chick. <br>  <br>  So if you do not want people to think you are ghetto then stop acting like it.  Stop protraying yourselves as being clowns and thugs. Then perhaps we might start taking you seriously.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	I don't know about the UK, but we're very much stereotyped as being loud, rude, pushy, obnoxious here in the states.

Reality television relies on controversy to capture an audience and the black people they choose either fit into the arrogant/aggressive camp or the bland/don't have many black friends camp. Brian and Alexandra from BB are perfect examples. <br>  <br>  I have noticed that black women cannot be loud/opinionated and accepted by the general audience. If they are quiet, appeal more to the wider"non-black" audience then they are. Look at the differences between the two black women from X Factor this year. The louder one had a better voice and yet had no chance of winning because of her personality. The winner wasn't a fantastic singer, yet appealed to the wider audience because she was more like-able.

How about unedited quotes DIRECTLY from the Book of Mormon?  You're going to need your spin doctor standing by for this one.  The following is a true story . . .<br>  <br>  . . . One time, 2 young Mormon women came a-knockin'.  They were both very attractive, polite and wholesome.  One of them was black.  I asked her why she chose to be a Mormon when the Book of Mormon contains insulting bigotry against black people.  Here's the verse I'm referring to:<br>  <br>  ????2 Nephi 5:21<br>  ????"And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them."<br>  <br>  ????See also: Mormon 5:15, Alma 3:6, Alma 3:9, Alma 3:14<br>  <br>  Can you believe that?  God made the descendants of Cain black so that they “might not be enticing” unto white people.  Blatant, transparent racism right in the "holy" Book of Mormon!  Not only is it racist, it's a bald-faced lie!!<br>  <br>  The white woman spoke up for the black woman and said that racism has been renounced by the Mormon church.  The black woman agreed.<br>  <br>  I asked how the Mormon church got the authority to renounce a verse from their "divinely inspired" Book of Mormon: could they override God's word?  They pulled out their "brown books" but could not find an answer.<br>  <br>  I then pointed out that if God really inspired the Book of Mormon, it would NEVER need ANY part renounced.  That only happens when humans pretend they're God.<br>  <br>  I told them that there were already far too many religions in the world before Mormonism came along.  How can God blame anybody for choosing the wrong religion?  Will he really condemn billions of people to hell because they guessed wrong?<br>  <br>  I suggested they keep an open mind and try to place their faith in scripture that doesn't contain ideas and practices that we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  What I didn't say was that, if they really tried to follow my advice, they wouldn't find ANY scripture WITHOUT ideas and practices we know are wrong.<br>  <br>  I must say that, despite the outcome of our conversation, the 2 young ladies remained open and engaged.  I didn’t detect any animosity.  However, when they eventually left, they were visibly shaken.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	The usual method involves distraction.

Get something to make your favorite breakfast tomorrow morning so that you start off the day with something good. Don't get stuck on all the bad things tomorrow or today about school. Think of good things like your friends or woo-hoo have your favorite lunch. Just don't think about how depressed you are. Try to stay happy and just be yourself.

Good times. <br>  <br>  Have an open mentality towards school, if you think positively about it then it wont be as hard.

AA10729675	Sarah is right.  Latin can only help, and help a lot!  Of course it is different from Spanish, French, Italian, etc.  but it is the base of those languages.

But evidence is not required for belief.  If there is a God, and if God expects us to believe on him through faith, I doubt that he would ever provide enough proof to eliminate that faith.  If there was undeniable proof that God existed, then everyone would KNOW (not believe) that there was a God, and that might not be what he wants for us at this time.  I've been agnostic for about 10 years, because I tend to rely too much on evidence.

Coincidence?<br>  <br>  Nobody has ever provided any evidence that any gods, much less a specific god, exist. People believe in specific gods because of indoctrination from an early age, tradition, apophenia, hallucinations, fear of torture (for gods sadistic enough to threaten it) and other similarly illogical reasons. But no gods exist in reality; these are all stories, created for people who were scared of the world long before we understood it. Now we have no more reason for these superstitions.<br>  <br>  And religious belief has caused more misery than any other idea throughout history.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	If God exists and the Bible writers imagined him correctly writing down everything they knew about God then this God is about the most SOB God ever invented...!!!<br>  <br>  Regardless of any “free will” the Bible God could have prevented Eve from touching a fruit from the tree of knowledge of GOOD AND EVIL simply because GOD IS LOVE and Eve HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL of any evil! Eve saw “that the fruit was good to eat” and she ate it in all her innocence in spite of any ban! Eve had no “Guardian Angel” to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She didn’t know that God set her up to fall! Again, she had no knowledge of ANY EVIL AT ALL! <br>  <br>  As soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with God’s Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against him ON FREE WILL and on the spot! According to the Theologians the highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of God’s goofs. He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit tree for about the same reason we eat any fruit that we feel that will help us to improve our well being. She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any Christian with a measurable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit only with the permission of his/her spiritual leader!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created an original whimsical God different from the other primitive Gods. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven at all. They became known as demons. According to the Bible writers they will be evicted from Heaven during the “Tribulation of the last days” (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have plenty of “spiritual” gullibility or rather FAITH!<br>  <br>  God set up a flaming sword “moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve may have had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever. God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he wouldn't “SIN against God"! God himself (NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF) was present in this King’s Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that King Abimelech might have enjoyed with Sarah! (BTW Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” not related to any Bible God) But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap that some Christians are willing to kill to defend! Actually, it takes years of schooling to keep Christianity marketable today!<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him perform in his royal bedroom!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband. God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he watched him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the Time God in the person of the Holy Ghost had to visit the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he KNEW A LOT about how to please mortal women!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he was aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN or even FOX NEWS for that matter was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is just like EVE did, but sorry to say Sarah was a “sinful” sexy woman not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit a sexual “sin” against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? Christians tell you that this God was very apologetic preventing Sarah from enjoying having sex because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors were loaded of sexual escapades! It is all in the Bible scrip!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a beautiful married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God…! The only thing that you need to watch for is the secular authorities that can arrest you for questioning as a “person of interest”…!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he won’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross as a “spotless lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. The Roman soldiers never dressed the genital area of their victims with a white diaper! Now Christians need to snack his spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross that he was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup.” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Hardly any Christian reads the Bible objectively… and the few who do don’t last long as Christians unless they have no scruples. Most preachers tell you that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it needs to be read in a “King James Version” or interpreted by specially schooled “men of God” full of the Holy Ghost (and BS)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom GOD? Christianity is about the most dishonest big business in the world!|`|GzlckRcnaa	God(Allah) do exist.if He is not exist then how can this world be created.do you ever think that how does this universe exist.there must be a very powerful creator to make all these amazing things.<br>  <br>  look around you.you will see the blue sky,you'll see birds,you'll see sunlight etc.doesn't this creatures have their own creator.human can't create sky,birds,n trees.God did created all this.<br>  <br>  some people says God(Allah) don exist coz they don see Him.how about wind.you can't see wind but you'll know the wind is there...same goes to your mind.i can't see your mind so can i say that u are mindless.Of coz not,all of us including you have mind so we need it to think about our surrounding n how come the surrounding happen.there must be a great Creator behind all these.we just have to believe in Him.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Well if I look in a mirror, I am evidence of God's creation!<br>  <br>  I didn't create myself, let alone create my own soul !!|`|AA10057370	I have experienced God in my life (and many others).|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Nah...unless you believe in unicorns too...|`|sLmX4H3Caa	Depends on what you believe.

OK, that is not completely true. I am not an atheist. I am not a believer. I am not an agnostic. I am none of these because the answer to g-d's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that g-d truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you run amok?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.<br>  <br>  Isn't the true purpose of spirituality personal development and growth, not the salvation reward? What type of supreme being needs or wants our devotion? I don't think any g-d would be that shallow. However, the bible says man was formed in g-d's image. Seems to me the holy book has that backwards: g-d was formed in man's image.|`|b9DhpqhUaa	I guess your question will be answered when judgement day comes.

Ayn7TqLRaa	A girl I used to go to school with lived in a large terraced house just up the road from me ~ a house I never liked walking past because it always felt wrong and bad. It was only recently she told she had lived in it for a couple years whilst she was doing her training for work.<br>  She lived there with three other woman (at the time they were all about 25 years old). This is about 12  years ago (we're both 37 now)<br>  One night they decided to hold a seance with Ouija board - it started of Ok - nothing much happened but after a while they got a message through, a dark, nasty message from a spirit saying he was going to harm them.<br>  That scared them and they stopped, put the lights on and drank loads of tea and thought no more about it.<br>  A couple of days later that's when things started to happen in the house.<br>  The first thing was the cat and dog which they owned refused to go up the stairs, absolutely refused and would spit and snarl if you tried to take them upstairs. The next thing, objects would starting disappearing and then re-appearing in strange places. One of the girls had a black shawl and this would keep moving all over the house when they were out (they were all training in the same college and all left and came home at the same time in the same car)<br>  The final straw came when a neighbour asked who their friend was who kept peering out of the upstairs bedroom window when they were all out everyday.<br>  Finally they decided to go to the local Spiritualist church one Wednesday night so see if there was anybody they could ask for help. When they arrived they all sat at the back and didn't say anything to anyone. When the medium guy stood up to start his session He stared at them for ages and shouted "You four, you've been  dabbling haven't you ~ You stupid people you've allowed an evil spirit into your house"<br>  This scared them so much they packed up and left the following week. <br>  <br>  They've all moved away since but I only live about 3 minutes walk away from that house and like I said at the beginning, every time I walk past it (which is not often) it's always felt wrong and somewhat foreboding.|`|kIEZ2HOgaa	when i was younger  i was in my basement then i ran up the stairs and i lokked for my mom and saw i figure pass by me i said "hi mom" and then my mom said "what?" from don in the basement! it gave me chills and has happened twice after that!!! i have other storys but id rather not tell them...|`|dbgQgYscaa	I had a ghost late one night shut down my DSL connection, shut down my dish network connection, but left my lights on, and then right afterwards, stomped with a big noise across the middle of my roof to were I was sitting at my computer trying to get up again and then stopped.

uUCTem2Eaa	Hinduism includes belief in gods. Buddhists may or may not believe in gods.<br>  <br>  Hinduism includes belief in the eternal self or soul (atman). Buddhism includes in the three marks of existence anatman, or no self. (Though some Buddhists believe in atman anyway.)<br>  <br>  Hinduism includes a caste system. The Buddha was a strong critic of the caste system (though some Buddhist countries formed caste systems of their own in spite of this).<br>  <br>  Hinduism promotes vegetarianism. Buddhists may or may not be vegetarians, depending on the country and school.<br>  <br>  Hinduism is an ethnic religion, and is mainly found among people who were born into it, or who married in. Buddhism is an evangelical religion, and actively aimed to spread and gain converts.<br>  <br>  Many Hindus (not all) believe the Buddha was the god Vishnu incarnate. Buddhists do not believe this.<br>  <br>  Most Hindus only practice Hinduism. Most Buddhists practice some other religion in addition to Buddhism (such as Daoism, Shinto, etc.)|`|1e7d56a3860040de885ccc1c5e24acf7aa	Buddhists believe in Buddha, Hindus believe in Hinda.|`|3d97cedda0f936e37048a4e1d413a7f8aa	same source but different teachings. hinduism believes god, but buddhism has no faith at all in god.
dDMOJWxwaa	By an understanding of this principle of pre-existence we understand the evolution of man, if that is a correct expression, or his eternal progress, following in the footsteps of the Savior, the First- born, being born of God in the spirit, having a spiritual existence and then coming here upon the earth to have an earthly existence, passing on through death to another spiritual existence, and then the resurrection, and through faithfulness and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel go on to eternal life and exaltation. There is just the one individual from beginning to end. The fallacy of the reincarnation of man theory is here made apparent, as also the doctrine of evolution, in which it is taught that man originated with the lower animals, the very lowest type, and came up by degrees.<br>  <br>  By reincarnation the power of God seems also to be limited. He uses the same, relatively few, spirits over and over again, endlessly, to accomplish whatever may be his purpose. He seems to be short of material and vague in his purpose. This is out of harmony with the gospel, which teaches that there is a host of spirits waiting to take upon themselves mortal bodies, and that the next stage of existence will come when this has been accomplished.   <br>  <br>  Reincarnation sets up no understandable objective of existence, except that we are advancing; but how and to what end? It reduces the spirit of man to the position of a treadmill worker in the affairs of the universe. Some say that the end is nirvana, first held to be extinction of existence; now a fusion into a mass of security. That does not help.  <br>  <br>  Reincarnation moves in a circle; the gospel in an ascending spiral. Existence without a definite objective, but with constant repetitions, is valueless.   <br>  <br>  Finally, reincarnation is incompatible with the resurrection of the body, through the redeeming service of Jesus Christ. The continuous changing of bodies makes the resurrection and any redeeming act, unnecessary. It places the Christ in the class of fakirs. A Christian cannot believe in reincarnation. That should be, in itself, a sufficient answer to the question at the head of this writing.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	So many people thought of reincarnation as someone coming back to life to straighten or put in order the mistakes he has done in his past which they call as Karmic cycle.

krRyKGWtaa	of course it does but you also have to keep in mind that for right now America is a major world power that does business with pretty much every country in the world. Nearly every country teaches English as a second language (if it is not their first language for instance: Israel, China, Germany, etc.). Hollywood definitely has taught many foreigners and English speakers American slang words and most likely online social networks like MySpace and Facebook have done this as well. Big American corporations also helped to teach slang because they do a lot of business with people outside the country.<br>  <br>  In terms of Americans not understanding slang from other countries, it is most likely because Americans have a great sense of nationality- that they are the greatest country in the world etc., so they don't feel like they need to learn other countries slang words especially not since pretty much every other country knows the slang words they use. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|jdKTs3aHaa	Well for me Im not aware of how other countries speak slang. Maybe because Americans are not exposed to foreign slang.

LQQAQDkIaa	These are all comparisons to lost souls. Wandering in the darkness of sin, while Satan prowls about looking for souls to devour. The joy of the people who found the lost objects. The joy in heaven is like that when a lost soul  finds their way back to God.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	They were found that is what they have in common.|`|l3A970zJaa	They all describe a person who has fallen away from the faith and come back again.  The first two, the lost sheep and the lost coin, Jesus is the one who comes searching for us for we are lost and cannot find our way back.  This happens when we have sin in our lives but are ignorant of it and are thus 'lost.'  In the third, the lost son, the Father only goes to the edge of the property to look for the son, the son has to come back on his own, but is then welcomed back.  This happens when we know what we are doing is wrong, but do it anyways, we make a conscious decision to sin and turn away from God.  God will still welcome us back, but when we have been rebellious, it is us that needs to turn back to Him instead of Him coming and finding us.  <br>  So what they have in common is symbolizing what happens when we sin and are separated from God depending on weather the sin was consciously or unconsciously committed. Did that make sense?

The process of assimilating involves taking on the traits of the dominant culture to such a degree that the assimilating group becomes socially indistinguishable from other members of the society. As such, assimilation is the most extreme form of acculturation. Although assimilation may be compelled through force or undertaken voluntarily, it is rare for a minority group to replace its previous cultural practices completely; religion, food preferences, proxemics (e.g., the physical distance between people in a given social situation), and aesthetics are among the characteristics that tend to be most resistant to change.

vNauoJgfaa	If she's a true friend, and knows you're bi and accepts it... then you should tell her.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't know you're bisexual, bring up some issues of bisexuality or homosexuality from gay/les/bi celebs or famous figureheads. If she's ok with it, just casually mention, "Yes I'm bisexual as well".<br>  <br>  True friends don't "dump" their friends for things like that. In my experience, they've been flattered but told me they don't feel the same. (Really understanding... I'm lucky to have them. lol) Then you can try distancing yourself if it hurts to be around them for a bit, but once you find another crush or something it can be easier to hang around them once more.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

Just begin by asking what her opinion of bi or lesbian women is. Continue that type of conversation to the point where you feel freer about telling her you are bi. Depending on her attitude at that time you will be able to tell what is the best course of action from that point.

Tn1bMQ3Aaa	The basic structure of French sentences is as follows<br>  Subject + verb + Direct Object<br>  <br>  However, there are particular grammar rules that are structurally different from English (not sure about Dutch)<br>  <br>  Adjectives usually go behind the noun it is modifying in French. However, there are exceptions to this rules as well. Color after the noun and B.A.G.S. go before the noun..A few can go before or after but the meaning changes with the position. This link explains the rules.<br>  <a href="http://french.about.com/od/grammar/a/adjectives_4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://french.about.com/od/grammar/a/adj...</a><br>  <br>  Another thing English speaker mix up is the use of prepositions with particular verbs when followed by another verb.

RYLkjYkIaa	yeah yr right, some people spread it and here we r, lots of wrong stuff going on, and i say from what and whom i know, i say 90% of that is only racism and not based on anything right.|`|StRaKUf6aa	It's no secret obsession.  <br>  <br>  It's apparent racism.|`|XimcTAFpaa	I just think they love us and want to know more about us...but just shy and cover up how they feel about us with jokes or racist remarks. Also they know whats a stereotype some of them troll online, but are decent people in real life.|`|ncdTxID9aa	The reason there are so many questions about blacks is because many users expect and only look for those questions. Other races get attacked in this section too, but the biggest attention goes to the black questions where like 20 to 30 people will answer.  If it's a troll question, that's exactly what they want, the attention.  If it's some one bringing up issues that blacks talk about but the pc members here take offense, then it's simply taken the wrong way.  Maybe some people are obsessed with black people on here but some people are ridiculed by being guilty of association(what I mean is, they ask a question about Blacks and however few people take it, determines most of how the others will answer)  because not everyone reads the details of a question.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Why is there a secret obsession going about black people?<br>  <br>  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  There is no way you can really get to know more about black people because a lot of the assumptions are based on stereotypes. And common sense not all black people are the same you can't base someone's character by their skin color.<br>  <br>  The same could be said of just about every other cultural and ethnic group.<br>  <br>  For instance: I am a 62 year old Southern White Woman.  Who did I vote for in the last election.  Give you a hint: not John McCain. :-)|`|ckVewstIaa	they have no lives, and they need to compensate for that by asking dumb questions about us 24/7|`|tusCN8zpaa	Oh honey its no secret. lol|`|r1BycC7Xaa	They love us.

krRyKGWtaa	Historically- men held most of the power like every other culture and civilization however, the bible (or as the Jews call it the Torah) portrays women and men as equals.<br>  <br>  Currently the gender roles in Israel- Jewish society are pretty much equal; men and women work, men and women are drafted to the army; most fields of work are open to both genders with the exception of driving tanks (only men can do that). Like all other countries there are some career fields that are more dominated by one of the genders for instance- teaching is dominated by women whereas plumbing is dominated by men.  <br>  <br>  Also like most cultures and society's the women have the role of child rearing while the men are mainly in charge of economically supporting the family however, just like in America women can work and be mothers at the same time. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps! if you need any more information please feel free to e-mail me at nowaynohow149@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

May Allah curse him and throw him in hell. He told the wife of Imam Hassan to poison him and was the reason for the death of Imam Ali a.s so why not curse him?<br>  <br>  @Ninja Ducky:- Don't tell me what to read. How about you read the Quran. The ayah of tatheer of Ahlul Bayt which Ayesha has nothing to do with. And the ayah of mawada where Allah tells us to love those near of kin and the ayah of wilayah. Read the Quran and your own Hadith books instead of claiming they are fabricated. I DON'T LIKE HER BUT I DON'T CURSE HER.<br>  <br>  @umm Hakim:- yes I am do you mind? Sunnis stick up for each other I guess Shias can do the same. But honestly it should be Muslims sticking up for each other I can't see this happening on this section.

zyw4i3kRaa	I think honestly that there are those high up who want to reduce the world's population & have always had an interest in doing so if one judges by the past patronage of eugenics. Read up on the UN and find out yourself about plans for reduction of population, the role cold, rationalistic science will play & general aping of social Darwinism.The public I think is now being conditioned to despise there own species (like round the clock coverage of human atrocity & nothing else) & desire population control as much as the cultural elite. This feelings against the useless eaters among us, like the octopulet's mother is a frightening trend. Who will be the one to decide who comes & who goes if we institute such policies?|`|1LZdc4K5aa	I think humans are our worst enemy.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I learned in sociology last semester that in developed, first world countries the birth rate is lowering.

Its because they have no access to birth control. Because of all the babies, they are just bringing more poor people into the world.

In middle school (about 100 years ago...lol), we had this very good, very nice substitute teacher who was a Nigerian immigrant and had a very strong accent.  You can guess what people called him.  Yep, a monkey.  Yes, this is coming from other black children.  They would do imitations of tribal dances and mock his accent.

True, we may speak different languages and eat different foods, but guess what, at the end of the day we have the same root:  Africa.  <br>  <br>  Think about the Haitian man the NYPD beat up, Abner Louima.

AA10463356	Never say "only" imaginary.  Imagination is the most powerful thing in the world.  Everything starts with imagination.

You might as well ask if the Weapons of Mass Destruction were only imaginary.  They were real enough to decide the destinies of millions of people.|`|Ayn7TqLRaa	God is as real as you want him to be. Most people of religion have their own image of God what they've created from both their own life experience and religious texts they may have read.

Personally I don't think he (or she? or it?) is ~ Living as a human being in a material physical world we're born to deal with the physical world and unless this supernatural entity appears as part of this physical world then it's very hard to put substance to him.<br>  So for my twopenneth I'd say he's imaginary.|`|79Qtlxi9aa	Alright here's what I think. God didn't create man. Man created God. But think of it this way. Man wanted some way to explain the unexplained, to better humanity, to make death seem like a beginning instead of an ending. So they made God. I am an atheist but there is NOTHING WRONG with them creating God. There's nothing wrong with that ever.

sn5334Kqaa	By not being dependent on government or expecting government to do anything for me.  What a novel idea....
kbYjkh45aa	Interesting presentation, Fifi. <br>  <br>  To your first question: most Latin-Americans, when addressing other Latin/Hispanic people in general conversation define their nationality terms by where they are originally from- e.g. [I am] Mejicano, Cubano, Puertorrique?o, Venezolano, Nicaraguense, Hondure?o, Peruviano.<br>  <br>  Then, I have noticed that here in the States, when a group (not an individual) of Latins/Hispanics address the general community- if they are born or have roots with this country, they will address themselves as Cuban-American, Mexican-American, etc. (just as you described above). Also, for the native-born Hispanics/Latino, they will sometimes address themselves by a moniker that adds regionalism to their background (Chicano, Nuyorican, Tejano). <br>  I'm no sociologist, but as a person of this ethnicity I find it quite amusing to see. The perspective seems to change depending on whom you are addressing or the perception of belonging when addressing an audience.<br>  <br>  To your second question: the 'generalization' of being labeled Hispanic or Latino (Latin-American) seems to tick-off a lot of people from this particular ethnic background, and I am not sure why. The definitions of Hispanic/Latino are clearly specified in our government's administration (U.S. Census), so we should understand how people of this background are 'labeled' (we have to collectively be called something!), and what does that really mean. <br>  And it so happens that the media, people in power, and others have taken those terms to generalize the general Hispanic/Latino population. The problem is, Latin-Americans don't like being called Hispanics, or vice-versa. Again, not sure why as these terms (as far as the U.S. is concerned) are just about interchangeable for our population. (and let's not get into how the Spaniards or the Portuguese do not like being labeled either!)<br>  To me, there is nothing offensive or condescending about the terms- especially because these terms do not describe my nationality but rather my inclusiveness. I think we all pretty much know where we come from to take offense at this!  But it's almost as people do no want to be associated with the other (perhaps because of pride?); kind of like 'Toons do not like being called Kopites or such). <br>  <br>  Final question: I personally do not find it important to label groups by their origin or ethnic background. I can see the point of our government in doing so (imaging trying to provide specific services to benefit all of our races, ethnic groups, backgrounds that make up our country- how to you tackle all of them without categorization?). But the great disadvantage of this is that it people tend to personalize these labels and then segregate because of it (the ol' Babel effect all over again). The terms also seem to carry a certain stigma for people, based on how others interpret these definitions.<br>  <br>  I hope this opinion can help you define your presentation.<br>  <br>  Saludos!
WEM5n41Oaa	The key to being a real Christian can be summed up in three characteristics.  1)  You were baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  2)  You believe in Jesus.  And 3)  You walk by the Spirit following Christ's commands.<br>  <br>  Of course none of us follow Christ with complete obedience.  We all fall short.  But a true Christian repents of their sins, doing the best that they can to please God and practice his requirements for our lives.  I was baptized twice.  That's not necessary but I chose to be baptized the second time.  The first time was when I had just been born.  Faith in Jesus?

b9fXwehraa	Lo he hecho: I have done it. <br>  Present perfect/indefinite past is used much the same way as in English. It refers to a past action at an indefinite time which is still going on or has an influence on the present.<br>  <br>  voy a hacerlo: it is not present progressive. yes, that would be estar+ present participle +infinitive. it could be present progressive in how it's translated in English.<br>  <br>  all perfect tenses use forms of haber +past participle.<br>  <br>  hecho is the past participle of hacer.|`|9jux2TAjaa	Lo he hecho is perfect as is conjugated with HABER...  lo HE hecho.<br>  <br>  Presente progreSivo   Lo estoy haciendo... <br>  <br>  Hecho is the participle of Hacer.|`|pqnrm1Nzaa	Lo he hecho - means "I have done it". It's an action you finished doing recently. If the action is complete, with a definite end, that makes it perfect.<br>  "Hecho" is the past participle of HACER. If you used the present tense instead, "lo hago", you would be saying "I do it", which could imply something you do on a regular basis, or something you are literally just about to do.<br>  "Lo voy a hacer" means "I am going to do it". It's present tense because the verb IR is in the present tense (voy); i.e., right at this moment, you're planning to do it in the future. (I hope that makes sense.) It's progressive because in English it translates to the "-ing" form (the gerund) of TO GO. So you're correct in saying the present progressive is like "I am reading".|`|MHyYQxEsaa	Ojela is correct..(his answer anyway)

VMOQFO4iaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  1) Noisy as a pack of dogs, my neighbours left to go to Valparaiso (last/at) night.<br>  <br>  2) The children left school happy about(/because it was) the end of term.<br>  <br>  3) Charles, rich as a businessman and glamorous as an actor, couldn't catch his beloved's attention.<br>  Is the appositive correct? <br>  - Yes.  Quite lengthy. literal and unusual but nonetheless a valid description.<br>  <br>  4) We got in the stadium ignoring the check-points.<br>  Ignoring explains an action happening at the same time. is it the ing- clause good? <br>  - Yes, it's okay - but your preposition should be 'into', as it denotes movement.<br>  <br>  It suggests that they would've paid for the ticket but ignored the check points.<br>  - No it doesn't necessarily suggest that they >would< have paid. They *might* have paid, but there again they might have been deliberately ignoring the checkpoints with the specific aim of getting in free of charge.  Difficult to tell.<br>  <br>  5) We got in the stadium by ignoring the check points.<br>  The method they used to enter the stadium was ignoring the check points. (is the prep. phrase ok?) <br>  - Yes, it is.  This version suggests that it was *only* by ignoring the checkpoints that they were able to gain access / get in.<br>  If you write a comma before "ignoring" AND remove the word 'by' it still it would still be a valid sentence but would not make the same suggestion that it was *only* ignoring the checkpoints that they were able to gain access / get in.  In other words, they *might* have been willing to pay if asked or challenged, but there again they might have been deliberately ignoring the checkpoints with the specific aim of getting in free of charge - as above.<br>  <br>  6) With a pair of earplugs and a mp3 player, a person could get deaf in six months.<br>  I know one can change the Prep.Phrase order depending on the emphasis you're giving to the sentence. :D right?<br>   - We don't say "get deaf".  "Get hot", "get cold", hopefully temporary states yes, but not a relatively permanent change such as losing one's hearing.  Better phrased as:<br>  "With a pair of earplugs and an MP3 player, a person could become deaf within six months."   - Note *an* MP3 player as the *'em'* is a vowel sound although not literally a vowel.<br>  <br>  7) Maria made very bad decisions afraid of what was gonna happen.<br>  - Should be: Maria made very bad decisions because she was afraid of what was going to happen.<br>  In other words, she was frightened or scared so she made some (perhaps hurried or rushed) decisions which were not good ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Could you explain these constructions?.

AA12006309	Look at the rate of heterosexual divorce, promiscuity and adultery.  Poll your friends and ask how many of them come from traditional nuclear families where mom and dad are happily married.

pqnrm1Nzaa	"Could" often sounds like something in the future that has not happened, for example, "If Luisa takes the test tomorrow, she could pass it". <br>  It can also be used to mean someone could have done something in the past, but didn't, so "Luisa could have passed the test, but she didn't". This is why we don't use it so much in past tense unless we mean that someone failed to do something they should have been able to do.|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	'Could' means there's a possibility of a negative, and an option.  Such as, "Could you pass me a pencil?"  "Could he have done that?" <br>  <br>  "Was able" is a positive past tense verb that leaves no options.  Such as, "I was able to pass the test, but I wasn't able to get a high score".<br>  <br>  Also, was able is the grammatically correct answer.  Although couldn't is used as such nowadays, when English grammar was developed, couldn't or could was improper.

3S3XjvYcaa	"Hogi" and "Hoga" alone don't really mean anything, with other context it would make sense, but basically..<br>  <br>  "Hogi" = "happen/will happen" (feminine)<br>  "Hoga" = "happen/will happen" (masculine)<br>  "Ho gaya" = "happened"<br>  <br>  Now if you use these in a sentence they make sense.<br>  <br>  Ex:<br>  <br>  "Kya ho gaya?" = "What happened?"<br>  "Wo mujhe per martha hogi." = "She died for me."<br>  <br>  The second sentence doesn't really mean "happen", "hogi" and "hoga" aren't always going to literally mean "happen."  It's kind of complicated for me to tell you the meaning in English, but "ho gaya" is generally used as "happened."<br>  <br>  There aren't really other forms of "ho", except "hai."<br>  <br>  "Ho" (masculine) = is/be<br>  "Hai" (feminine) also = is<br>  <br>  "Ye hai bakwaas." = "This is bull****."<br>  "Choop ho." = "Be quiet."<br>  ____________________________<br>  <br>  "Hua" = "Happened"<br>  karna = "have to do"<br>  kar = "do (this)"<br>  karo = "do (this)"<br>  karengay = "do/doing (this)<br>  karoongi? = "(will you) do it?"<br>  karoon = "do (this)"<br>  <br>  A lot of them are "do (this)", but depending on the context you will use different forms..<br>  <br>  "Ye karo" = "Do this"<br>  <br>  "Hum ye karengay" = "We will do/be doing this" (If you used "karo" or "karoon" over here it would be wrong)<br>  <br>  "Mai ye tho karoon?" = "Should I do this (one)?" (If you used another form it would be wrong)<br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  Ok, "laga" is another word that's hard to translate into English from Hindi.  A lot of words in Hindi are like that, so I'll have to give you examples to show you.  There aren't really clear-cut definitions..<br>  <br>  "Mujh tho laga" = "It seemed to me" (Here, "laga" is "seemed")<br>  <br>  "Lagi" = "hurt (physically)"<br>  Ex: "Mai laghi hoon." = "I'm hurt."<br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  Yes, I know, it's probably quite confusing for people born in other countries who didn't learn Hindi from the beginning.  If you start speaking it more or visit India it will just start sounding right, and you'll see when to use which form.  For me, if I have to see whether to use "hai" or "ho", or "karo" or "karoon" it's just automatic, one sounds better than the other by the context.  You also have to understand the rest of the context.  If you practice you should catch on.|`|6kenxQESaa	hogi-female- will happen<br>  hoga-male- will happen<br>  ho gaya- already happened<br>  <br>  hota-happening

RC5RAzykaa	Friend Abby,  You know me, now know that I am a Seventh Day Adventist as well.  The Baptists have very sound doctrine except for that they are Sunday observers, instead of keeping the Saturday Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment as given by God.<br>     Many will tell you that we are not under Law, but we are under grace in Jesus, this is correct, but just because we are under grace does not give us license to sin.<br>    Romans 6:15 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.<br>    Now we see that grace does NOT mean we are allowed to sin.<br>    Now what is sin?<br>    SIN IS TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW!<br>  1st John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.<br>    This means that breaking ANY of the Ten Commandments is sin. And the Saturday Sabbath is the Fourth Commandment.  <br>     We keep the Law, not because we feel we have to for our salvation, but because we love God, and keeping His Commandments is how we show our love for Him.<br>  1st John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous..<br>     Jesus said that until heaven and earth pass away, the law remains:<br>  Matthew 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>    The new covenant between people and God is that God has written the LAW on our hearts<br>  Jeremiah 31:33 But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>     There are ordinances of men, sometimes called law, that were abolished by Christs sacrifice on the cross.<br>  Colossians 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;<br>   THIS IS IN NO WAY TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE LAW OF GOD WHICH IS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS!  This is a major error of the Baptists church<br>    We have just seen Jesus say that the Law should not pass "until heaven and earth pass"<br>    Has heaven and earth passed?  Of course not.  In fact the book of Revelation states that those who are in God both have the testimony of Christ and keep the COMMANDMENTS! It is for this reason Satan wars with them.<br>  Revelation 12:17   And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>     Abby, here I will get harsh, but it is only because the Truth must be spoken.  And the Truth is that Sunday observance is a sin, for it is transgression of the Law, as we have defined before.<br>    Now if we break ONE of the laws, we are guilty of breaking ALL of the Law!<br>    James 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.<br>    This is where it gets harsh.<br>    If you break the Sabbath Law, you are guilty of murder, you are guilty of adultery, you are guilty of stealing, and ALL THE REST!<br>    Not my words, but the Word of God!<br>  In fact, breaking the Sabbath Law is breaking the FIRST Commandment of Christ, which is to love God.<br>  Mark 12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.<br>   And we have already shown that the Love of God is keeping His Commandments, which are the Ten Commandments.<br>     Lets keep it simple,<br>  Is it a sin to murder?<br>  Is it a sin to steal?<br>  Is it a sin to commit adultery?<br>  Is it a sin bear false witness against thy neighbor?<br>  IS IT A SIN TO FAIL TO REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY?<br>  <br>  They are all part of the same law!  You decide!<br>  <br>  There are other differences between the Baptist church and the Seventh Day Adventists, but the Sabbath is the main concern.<br>  <br>  I will have you know that the pope of the catholic church is the one responsible for changing the observance to Sunday, and this is proof that he is the beast as described in the Book of Daniel and Revelation.<br>  Many churches follow this apostasy which is the worship of the image of the beast.  Sunday observance was instituted to bring pagan sun worshipers into the catholic church, and so many are willing to follow down this path of destruction.<br>  <br>    I have backed up my arguments with numerous scripture, most taken from the New Testament, showing that Gods law is just as significant today as ever.   Those who tell you otherwise do so because they love sin, and remember that sin is transgression of the Law<br>  <br>    Gods Grace covers your past, but not all of those who claim Jesus will be saved, except those who walk in obedience to Him.<br>   referring to the Words of Jesus Luke 13:27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.<br>  <br>  Workers of iniquity are sinners, and sin is transgression of the Law<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s.   Keeping the Sabbath is not trying to justify ourselves by works, for indeed we are NOT to work on the Sabbath.  So the Seventh Day Adventist is often condemned for trying to justify him/herself by works, by the act of NOT working, you figure that one out!|`|uAMzmAwaaa	the theology is different, for instance Seventh Day Adventists worship on the Sabbath (Saturday) while Baptists worship on the first day (Sunday). also not sure what Seventh Day Adventists believe, but Baptists generally believe that the miracles in the Bible don't/won't happen now a days.|`|AA10717341	Christians all believe in Jesus Christ and are Christians because they identify themselves as following Him.<br>  <br>  Within Christianity there are three major divisions:  Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant.  The rift between Roman Catholic and Orthodox arose roughly when huge Roman Empire split into Western Europe and the Byzantine Empire in about the 7th Century.  As a result, the Christianity in those two regions separated as well.<br>  <br>  The Protestant Reformation is considered as essentially beginning (although there were some reformers prior to this date) 1517 when Martin Luther posted his 95 thesis or statements of opposition to the Roman Catholic church.  Thus, Protestants began as a reform, "protest" movement.<br>  <br>  Since the Protestant Reformation, numerous denominations -- each with different interpretations and understanding of scriptures and separate and distinct government and leadership have sprung up.  <br>  <br>  Seventh-day Adventists and Baptists are two examples of Protestant denominations.  <br>  <br>  Structurally, the Baptist churches are congregational in that they more of a confederation and a structured hierarchy.  As their name implies, Baptists believe in baptism -- and emphasize believer baptism -- in that the person being baptized must be old enough and mature enough to make a decision for Christ. <br>  <br>  Seventh-day Adventists, are Protestant Christians.  As our name implies we follow the example of Christ (Luke 4:16) and the apostles (Acts 17:2) in observing the seventh-day Sabbath as set apart by God at creation (Gen. 2:2) and more fully clarified within the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:3-20).  We also believe in the soon return of Christ for those who follow Him ("advent").  <br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Baptist (usually) teaches the right Gospel, which is by grace through faith in Jesus alone without any of our works added. <br>  <br>  Seventh day adventist is wrong on the Gospel.  Seventh day adventist teaches works for salvation, and they require you to keep Saturday sabbath, and they require you to avoid certain foods, etc..  Seventh day adventism is not Christian.  Here's some reading about them:  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Seventh-Day%20Adventist/sda_not_christian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20R...</a>|`|8IHfytEvaa	Most Baptists teach Biblical theology.  Salvation by grace alone thru faith alone and that Jesus did it all on the cross and that man can't add anything to the salvation purchased for us by Jesus.<br>  <br>  SDA's teach that after one becomes a Christian one needs to start following the Law of Moses, the Law Jesus did to fulfull and cancel.<br>  <br>  Paul's letter to the Galatians was written to an early church in a town where the leaders were teaching the same stuff the SDA's are teaching today.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that if you try to add keeping the law to grace you've lost grace.<br>  <br>  Which is why I believe that SDA's are probably not really Christians.|`|m8kF5U84aa	i know that the seventh day adventist only eat sertent foods and the the baptist can eat anying thing. that's about all i know. i hope i helped somewhat.|`|UinOWcMUaa	both are Christians -- but seventh day worship on Saturdays (Sabbath)-- instead of Sundays.. though some Baptist worship on Saturday as well.. but for 7th day it's just Exclusive for Saturdays :)

I'm in grade 11 now and were are lovers (i hate the word lovers :P).|`|927c9ad529b701d86768917accd19dbfaa	Weird and awkward. It was also my first kiss, period. Well he was extremely nervous, and kinda rushed things. We had no cute lil pecks or anything first. lol. He just rushed in with the tongue. It was pretty um...yeah..., weird and awkward. lol

iu4SOin3aa	Both are the same, except one is in paper for and one is in card form.<br>  A gift card is like a creadit card, but with no interest.<br>  However much money you put on the card is how much you have to spend at that place, same with the gift certificates.<br>  But there are no discounts or anything.<br>  So really there in no benefit.<br>  <br>  The purpose of the card is for example, its my birthday and I like a certain store or restaruant. You would purchase me a gift card for that resturant/ store, and it can only be used there.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Some place do give you extra money on your gift card if you buy a certain amount.

AA11085101	In Japanese culture, butterflies have a slew of meanings. Their most obvious symbolism is metamorphosis or transformation. This symbolism of transformation is taken one step further to represent those who have died (or that they 'carry' the recently departed souls). Sometimes, butterflies are interpreted as messengers, and following them will lead to a mystery's (or problem's) solution. Since butterflies have a very obvious cycle of transformation, birth, and death, it's easy to see why they have been used to represent spirits.|`|33E9E96iaa	Souls of the dead.
avfdeyxNaa	Yeah, it's pretty confusing to be 14 with all those crazy hormones and everything.....A lot of people think they like the same sex at that age, and then they go and label themselves and put themselves in a box. But they're unhappy later, cuz they're not really gay or bisexual - it was just a little bicuriousity in their teen years. <br>  <br>  So, if you like girls, maybe try being with a few. See how it feels. But don't rush to label yourself. Give it a few years. See how you feel then. You've got your whole life ahead of you, keep your options open.<br>  <br>  If you wanna talk to your friends and family about how you're feeling, it's a great idea to. If not, that's okay too. Just be yourself, be with who you wanna be with, and be happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything (:|`|ECMtjGf5aa	Went down the same road until I found out I was always straight.|`|czAbrzcUaa	I used to think I was bi, but you never really know until you've um, tried it'. I now know I'm not bi, I'm straight. (Im 16)<br>  You're only 14 so don't worry if you don't know what your sexuality is right now, you don't have to put a label on it just yet (:|`|GGf3XRBCaa	Stop rushing to figure it all out.

eXzUJbQJaa	Well yer firstly i think u shud have a guy/girl party because its good to have a mix, it depends where u want to have it, if there's like a civic hall type thing in your town u could book it out in advance and have it there if u don't want to have at ur house, and then before ur party ur parents could bring the food earlier on and let u and ur friends enjoy urself. You could have a dj playing different music with steroes/hi-fi whatever and let ur friends bring their own music too. Then obviously clean up after the party. Have fun...hope this helps ya..<br>  <br>  Also u cud play spin the bottle, or truth or dare......even watch a movie, a boy V girl dance off--the winner could win a prize and lozer has to do a dare or the first one to lose etc...
IpD4VhnCaa	It seems rather complicated...But if they get caught she could in fact lose her teaching license... And if your friend Penny is under 18 still, then Carrie could also go to jail...It would probably be wise if they stopped seeing each other outside of school...Going to jail can and would really make life much harder for Carrie, and not to mention Penny...Best thing to do is to quit while ahead. Good luck.|`|x7uRjwseaa	Sounds like a plot to a low budget movie. I would so pay to see that if its about two guys. lmao. :-p|`|iGBMtmYXaa	wow that sounds a little complicated but for 1 if no1 knows about it then they should stop now while they are ahead. second if some1 does find out then all hell will break loose and she will lose her teaching licence as well as go 2 jail and be on the sex offenders website for life. and that kills any thought of getting a good job ever....anyway if these 2 ppl could just wait until it is legal life would be sooooo much easier|`|AA12006309	It *does* sound like a movie plot.  Yes, she could lose her license if she had one (you mentioned she's a student teacher, she doesn't have a license yet).  She'll lose the ability to gain her teaching license and all the work leading up to this point will have been for nothing. Depending on the laws in your area she could face criminal prosecution as well.<br>  <br>  They both need to take the time to prioritize - what is more important, their little fling or her teaching career?|`|q4swmrK7aa	umm not that it should matter but the situation is complicated. for of all penny is underage and perhaps it would be best to not have sex cause it may really put carrie's career at risk. but should still meet each other and hang out because the more they try to end their feelings, the stronger it will get.|`|gWJqarq8aa	she'll loose her teaching lessons and will end up in jail!|`|vFkh9LQ9aa	That's a hard issue... If they get caught then Carrie will definitely lose her licence but it's worth it for love... They should try and end it but it will be very hard seeing each other every day. :/
K5dPbay6aa	In modern world economic history, China’s reformation and progression should be regarded as truly historical. While Mao and his radical comrades struggled for half a century to<br>  convert China into a Communist state, his successors took less than a quarter century to dismantle<br>  Mao’s legacy. Despite the ebbs and flows of the reform, China is now traveling on the right track.<br>  It has not only become the world’s third largest economic power with a foreign trade of 1 trillion<br>  dollars a year but also the world’s emerging center for manufacturing and research and<br>  development. With continuous inflow of foreign capital and an improved environment for<br>  domestic and foreign investment, the Chinese economy will enter a virtual cycle of growth where<br>  economic success will push for further reforms. With one-sixth of the world’s population,<br>  China’s prosperity would not only benefit its own citizens but also the well-being of the whole<br>  world.

2PZnXjZ7aa	I was at my Dad's house. My younger self and my nephews from around the same age were home alone and playing games. I got frustrated because one wouldn't follow the rules and leaned against the stove, arms crossed. Then, from out of the hallway, a knife emerged in a spinning circular moving toward me. It landed sideways on my crossed arm, its sharp end pointing toward my heart. We were too young to be frightened, so we started to look in the hall and the hall's room. Of course, we found nothing. And of course, no one believed us.|`|8RkYlaQxaa	I have and I will never forget it<br>  <br>  Ok, so about 4 years ago, me and some of my neighborhood friends were at our local pool at about 11 at night. We were just havin a night swim and having a good time. So our pool is next to a house that know one had lived in for about 3 years. Also, we know that  the last family who lived there, thier grandma died in the house. So anyways back to the story... so we were all just swimmin' and having a good time and then all of a sudden...<br>  <br>  I looked up at the house's window and saw this weird yellowish-whitish aura that resembled a older woman looking down at us. Like it was watching us to see if were safe or something. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. What ever it was, it slightly opened the shutters on the window and waved at me. At that moment, my face turned pale white and when I turned around to tell my buddy, the shutters closed and the aura was gone. I seriously freaked and didn't want to be near that house for the rest of the night. <br>  <br>  Well, that's my story. Believe it or not, but I sware I saw something in that window that night.|`|eaGZinlgaa	I have encountered lots over 30+years from asian, to kids to the elderly<br>  <br>  some have been delightful ,curious (just like us some cannot believe they have died no fault of there own )I have laid with prayer, candles ,candle magic and my secret ingredients and herbs.<br>  <br>  <br>   unruly , lost souls, and alike to rest in peace    Ienjoy it and glad i can be of assistance..ahh....   .my history ...(i am the great grand daughter of the 7th child and my gran was her 7th child  i am proud of  them +my abilitities)So theres now't to be scared of .HONEST!!!
JMOLRKRraa	ninja's very interesting subject.<br>  Invisibilty is actually knowing where to hide, where people look and some insight on the eyeball.<br>  Ninja's are basically trained assassins, but<br>  the mind control exercises are very interesting, can really open you up to other's intentions and motives.|`|TQOVizbsaa	Not much I know of these guys. But I think they are trained to be silently stealthed and quite adroit in doing things without anybody noticing it. The military "Special Forces" have some similar training but I let somebody who knows better explain it. Not me. P.D: The Ninjas are not "supernatural", however.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Do you really want to know the secret of how to turn invisible? it was a technique culled from buddhist teachings actually, applied in a more 'direct' manner. It can be summed up very simply:<br>  <br>  "The man who is unrecognized by others is the man who is unrecognized by himself. The man who is invisible to others is the man who is invisible to himself."<br>  <br>  To move without moving, breathe without breathing, act without acting, is not just a lesson learned by the samurai but by the ninja. Meditating under a waterfall doesn't just build up your physical endurance, it builds up your emotional, psychological, and finally spiritual presence, or non-presence. In your meditation, when you are no longer meditating, when you and the water do not meet, you will have no need of black clothes to hide you, you will be hidden from yourself.|`|fVnbFLsQaa	When I served with the SAS, I spent some time in Japan with Japanese Special Forces who are all trained Ninjas.<br>  At this time, they were conducting experiments into invisibilty in conjunction with the US. I was part of this experiment and was very dubious about it at the beginning. But after being subject to various chemicals and a warp capacitor was rendered invisible, I did not believe this until I was shown a mirror, the only drawback was I had to walk sideways to maintain my cloak of invisibilty.|`|MQBKnbSFaa	Historically ninjas mostly relied on disguise and poison

Blacks are resentful of rapid asian american assimilation and success in school and in the workforce. Where Blacks and Asians live in proximity the resentment is palpable. <br>  The existence of Asian street gangs has done nothing to quell the hatred.|`|tlUihEOvaa	I dunno and I did study Asian American history along with some Black History. <br>  <br>  I'm willing to team up with other minorities for civil rights.

eulMjLtPaa	This was supposedly on his gravestone:  "Here lies Arthur, the once and future king."  They believed he would return to rule again.<br>  <br>  That's one of my favorite books.  Did you enjoy it?|`|E2oH02h8aa	Oh man, I just did a huge research project on King Arthur, and a good portion of it was based on the title "Once and Future King" In all honesty, nobody knows 100%. But the reason why it became so popular, was because Arthur whether he was a King or just a fantastic military leader, he was well respected by his people. Especially or rather obviously in Britain. The Celtics are a type of British people, that believed that King Arthur would once return from the Isle of Avalon, when they are in great need, and the Celtics feel that this is the rebirth of their entire nation. The fact that they believe that it is the rebirth of their entire nation, is why is has stuck for so long and is so popular. But, the creator of this inscription and the reason for it is still unsure to this day as well as the existence of Arthur himself.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Maybe it is better you and the rest of the world don't know this mystery. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.|`|7lnyNHgYaa	It originated in Sir Thomas Malory's Morte D'Arthur. In Malory's story, the inscription on Arthur's grave was HIC IACET ARTORIUS REX QUONDAM REXQVE FUTURUS — "Here lies Arthur, the once and future king."|`|5aTGdBNuaa	Could it be that Malory sought to flatter the monarch of the day by implying that the spirit of King Arthur existed in them, and would in all their descendants|`|JMOLRKRraa	I think he was king then lost the kingdom then regained it.

IQT1BFjDaa	First question: italian has no neuter form. Only masculine and feminine.There's no "it", only "he" or "she". As a common rule, when a singular noun ends with "a" it's feminine, when it ends with "o" it's masculine. In the plural, "e" is fem, "i" is masc. There are many exceptions, of course, you may stumble on many, because in fact italian IS gramatically challenging for english speakers.|`|0v7Msiznaa	its pretty simple im currently learning to speak latin and italian its not to hard i found french very hard to learn|`|q8dErKKEaa	Cancel the word "neuter" when you're studying Italian.

wPD3BGEHaa	I completely believe in all these things, in fact I had an experience with a ghost when I was a child. When I was three, we had a horrible storm in Pittsburgh, I can remember being terrified because of the wind and thunder. <br>  <br>  About 10 minutes into lying with my head under the pillow I heard a strong male voice tell me to "get out of the room NOW!!" well that scared me more than the storm and I flew down the stairs to my parents I can assure you that they did not believe me and started walking me back to my room.<br>  <br>  we never made it, about half way up to my room we heard a loud crash coming from my room, now it was my dads turn to fly up the stairs, and when he did all the air left him because my ceiling crashed onto my bed and one of the metal bars from the ceiling was right where my head impression was on the pillow. I later heard my mom thanking whoever saved my life that night.<br>  <br>  So you see I believe in most things that I can't see, just because you can't see something does not mean it doesn't exist...and by the way I never heard that voice again.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Seeing is believing.

Scientists need not apply.|`|SuvXbPvgaa	What are the prerequisites for inducing an OBE? <br>  Many of the inducing methods use as a starting point techniques designed to improve the novice's powers of relaxation, imagery, and concentration. The ideal state appears to be one of physical relaxation, or even catalepsy, combined with mental alertness. <br>  <br>  One of the easiest ways to relax is to use progressive muscular relaxation. In outline this technique consists of starting with the muscles of the feet and ankles and alternately tensing and relaxing them, then going on up the muscles of the calves and thighs, the torso, arms, neck and face, until all the muscles have been contracted and relaxed. Done carefully this procedure leads to fairly deep relaxation within a few minutes, and with practice it becomes easier. <br>  <br>  Relaxation usually leads to state of paralysis or catalepsy. When you go to sleep, your brain deactivates the mechanism by which you are able to use your limbs, so that you become incapable of physical activity corresponding to your dream images when you dream. Quite a few people have found themselves in this paralysis state as soon as they have gotten up after sleeping. <br>  <br>  The first type of paralysis, known as 'type A,' is a condition encountered when approaching a deeper layer of consciousness from a light trance state. The second, type B paralysis, is the reverse of type A, in that it happens during the return home to physical reality. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Practice 1: Read the description slowly and then try to imagine each stage as you go along: <br>  <br>  Imagine an orange. It is resting on a blue plate and you want to eat it. You dig your nail into the peel and tear some of it away. You keep pulling on the peel until all of it, and most of the pith, is lying in a heap on the plate. Now separate the orange into segments, lay them on the plate as well, and then eat one. If this task doesn't make your mouth water, and if you cannot feel the juice which squirts from the orange, and smell its tang then you do not have vivid or trained imagery. Try it again, the colors should be bright and vivid and the shapes and forms clear and stable. With practice at this and similar tasks your imagery will improve until you may wonder how it could ever have been so poor. <br>  <br>  Practice 2: This is a rather harder one: <br>  <br>  Visualize a disc, half white and half black. Next imagine it spinning about its center, speeding up and then slowing down, and stopping. Next imagine the same disc in red, but as it spins it changes through orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Finally you may care to try two discs side by side spinning in opposite directions and changing color in opposition too. Other useful skills are concentration and control. Not only do you need to be able to produce vivid imagery, but also to abolish all imagery from your mind, to hold images as long as you want and to change them as you want, both quickly and slowly. <br>  <br>  Practice 3: Brennan suggests trying to count, and only to count. The instant another thought comes to mind you must stop and go back to the beginning. If you get to about four or five you are doing well, but you are almost certain to be stopped by such thoughts as 'this is easy, I've got to three already,' or 'I wonder how long I have to go on.' All these skills, relaxation, imagery and concentration, are suggested again and again as necessary for inducing an OBE at will. Other aids include posture. If you lie down you might fall asleep, although Muldoon [MC29] advocates this position. On the other hand discomfort will undoubtedly interfere with the attempt. Therefore an alert, but comfortable posture is best. Some have suggested that it is best not to eat for some hours before and to avoid any stress, irritation or negative emotions.<br>  <br>  <br>  How to induce an OBE?<br>  <br>  <br>  Imagery Techniques<br>  It is possible to use imagery alone but it requires considerable skill. <br>  <br>  a) Lie on your back in a comfortable position and relax. Imagine that you are floating up off the bed. Hold that position, slightly lifted, for some time until you lose all sensation of touching the bed or floor. Once this state is achieved move slowly into an upright position and begin to travel away from your body and around the room. Pay attention to the objects and details of the room. Only when you have gained some proficiency should you try to turn round and look at your own body. Note that each stage may take months of practice and it can be too difficult for any but a practiced OBEer.<br>  <br>  b) In any comfortable position close your eyes and imagine that there is a duplicate of yourself standing in front of you. You will find that it is very hard to imagine your own face, so it is easier to imagine this double with its back to you. You should try to observe all the details of its posture, dress (if any) and so on. As this imaginary double becomes more and more solid and realistic you may experience some uncertainty about your physical position. You can encourage this feeling by comtemp

First of all, stop putting yourself down. Secondly, never compare yourself to others. there will always be people that are prettier or smarter than you. On the other hand, there will be people that are uglier or dumber than you. This mind game sets you up for disappointment or a big ego trip. And believe me neither one is good.<br>  <br>  This is an exercise that you can do to build your self esteem. Write down ten things that you like or love about yourself. Put each one on a separate piece of paper. then put the comments all over your bedroom or bathroom and make sure you read them each day. Another exercise is to ask your close friends what they like about you and write these comments on a piece of paper that you can refer to when you are feeling bad about yourself. Last but not least as you get older you will value your youthful appearance. It is actually a blessing. Take care and continue to be yourself. The shyness is a small facet of your personality.

2PZnXjZ7aa	Ehhh, I don't think I've ever talked to one. Nor have I ever directly seen one. Here's one of my experiences, if you want to hear it...<br>  I was at my Dad's house. My younger self and my nephews from around the same age were home alone and playing games. I got frustrated because one wouldn't follow the rules and leaned against the stove, arms crossed. Then, from out of the hallway, a knife emerged in a spinning circular moving toward me. It landed sideways on my crossed arm, its sharp end pointing toward my heart. We were too young to be frightened, so we started to look in the hall and the hall's room. Of course, we found nothing. And of course, no one believed us.<br>  <br>  * Here's an Ouija board story, but it's my friend's, so I don't know whether it's true or not... <br>  When my friend got an Ouija board way back then when she was a teen, she was on the skeptical side. With a group of her friends (not including me) she decided to try and 'contact' her dead grandmother. They were 'freaked out' as she asked questions only her grandmother would know. The atmosphere in the room was eerie too. One of the more cowardly girls got really scared and started backing away. She bumped into the wall and knocked down all of the picture frames--except the one with a picture of my friend and her grandmother. A while after, more creepy stuff started happening to them. My friend learned that she might have opened a window to the 'other side' or something. She thought it was a joke until the so called 'coincidences' became unbearable.Then, after getting advice from Yahoo Answers, she the soaked the board in salt water and later burned it.<br>  <br>  * Twilight Lover-- We tried this at school as well. One of the boys went into the bathroom with the lights off and did the ritual while we waited outside. He came out, and said that nothing happen. But when another boy went in, he said that there was something there. I took a peek myself, and surely enough, there was something that looked like a line of blood on the mirror. I didn't look closely enough to check if it was real or not. I wouldn't dare go into the boy's bathroom! Then we told the janitor, who then cleaned it up.|`|TQOVizbsaa	Well, Casper the Friendly Ghost hasn't drop in to my apartment for a talk. And hasn't made a phone call yet.|`|4dwzZyvsaa	Does Bloody Mary count? Well anyway, I will tell you the story. One day, my friends and I were at school, and we had nothing do do after school so we did the Bloody Mary trick. You make sure that there is ABSOLUTELY NO light in the bathroom. All the shades are down, the lights are off. Then we KICKED the bathroom stall and then went in, locked the door, flushed the toilet, and then turned around five times saying, "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" and then you wait until the flushing of the toilet stops, open the bathroom stall, and then believe it or not, we actually saw blood on the wall! You should try it sometime! It ACTUALLY works!|`|8RkYlaQxaa	I have and I will never forget it<br>  <br>  Ok, so about 4 years ago, me and some of my neighborhood friends were at our local pool at about 11 at night. We were just havin a night swim and having a good time. So our pool is next to a house that know one had lived in for about 3 years. Also, we know that a the last family who lived there, thier grandma died in that house. So anyways back to the story... so we were all just swimmin' and having a good time and then all of a sudden...<br>  <br>  I looked up at the house's window and saw this weird yellowish-whitish aura that resembled a older woman looking down at us. Like it was watching us to see if were safe or something. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. What ever it was, it slightly opened the shutters on the window and waved at me. At that moment, my face turned pale white and when I turned around to tell my buddy, the shutters closed and the aura was gone. I seriously freaked and didn't want to be near that house for the rest of the night. <br>  <br>  Well, that's my story. Believe it or not, but I sware I saw something in that window that night.|`|cQSojmCJaa	yes i have. me and my sister stayed at my cousins house for the night. she had this new camera hooked up onto the computer so we took a picture. this girl covered my cousins face. she wasnt see through or anything but you know she was there and the flash only takes 2 seconds and we didnt see her. ive never seen her in my life! i dont know but we all remember it but no one really believes us because my cousin got scared and deleted it. i wish we could find it so BAD!!!!|`|gmlqni7Naa	There are hundreds of encounters every day.

People have been persecuted for their beliefs.  Some of the persecutors were those who claimed the spiritual authority of the Church.  <br>  <br>  You may believe that God and Jesus only did good things.  Yet, the difficulty lies in the conduct of those who used God and Jesus to justify their own crimes.<br>  <br>  It's only human to identify the abusers with their own argument.  If they acted hatefully and justified their actions by their interpretation of what God or Jesus requires, then it's not illogical for their victims to condemn God or Jesus.|`|t4DP30r6aa	First... You don't mean "athiens" you mean "atheist".  And atheist does not mean that they "hate God", it simply means that they believe a "God" or any God does not exist, that we are products of chance , biology, or big bang. Atheist's tend to be people who only believe what can be "proven" and since God is based on faith they do not believe in Him. BTW... when you write about God, if you are a believer, he is capitalized. Anytime you refer to him, such as He, His, God, etc. Finally, in all fairness, Jesus died on the cross, but in the old testimate God was very spiteful, vegeful and mean. Look at Saddom and Gomorah.|`|fHuj0Opsaa	Uh yeah... because people who don't believe in God believe in the Devil? HAHAHA you're delusional. Jesus didn't die FOR us, he didn't have a choice, he was psycho. You think that just because he was the first one to claim to be the son of God he is? He just beat some other people to it. I have more respect for the homeless man begging for change than your fictional beliefs you use to feel better about yourself and put others down.<br>  <br>  btw, you're Christian grammar sucks|`|d19goHi5aa	the same reason christians dont believe in budda or any of those..<br>  athiests just dont believe in religeon<br>  its their way of life.<br>  and they dont HATE them|`|RAIcBSSGaa	.........I'm catholic but seriously calm down people can believe what they want don't get all worked up.|`|DhwZgf02aa	Learn to grammar.<br>  <br>  <br>  People can believe what they want.

9kMJJ1giaa	I would contact Child Protective Services.  There has to be some reason the child is screaming in the middle of the night.  If everything checks out with both parents, then C.P.S. can see that the parents take the child to get medical/psychological help that he must need.  That is not normal for a child to do that.<br>  <br>  You could suggest to the parents to take the child to get medical/psychological help, if you know them well enough to do that.<br>  The mother yelling, or complaining to the landlord will not help in any way.<br>  <br>  Don't just grin and bear it.  The child needs something.  Try to get the child some kind of help.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, at 8, a child should be sleeping through the night without trouble, unless there is something else going on. <br>  <br>  You could talk to the parents first, calmly. In other words, don't go over there and assume they're abusing him and accuse them. <br>  <br>  Ask them if their child is OK because you heard him screaming in the middle of the night.  If they give you a straight answer, then everything should be OK.  It may just be temporary.  <br>  <br>  But if they're argumentative and tell you to mind your own business, I would call the police, and preferably while the screaming is going on if possible, as someone already said...|`|yk4S7uuraa	I would ask around and see if anyone else hears it and see what they say. Ask them if they have reported it to the landlord? If not, then that's exactly what you hold do. <br>  <br>  You don't have to put up with that. If the child needs medical attention, its up to the parents to take care of that. By complaining you may be helping the child because his parents may be thorough @$$holes.|`|LICzadWCaa	Depends on why he is screaming. I've had occasional night terrors, even as an adult; I scream in my sleep for about half an hour, unaware I'm doing it or able to stop. I can't be woken up for love nor money - if my family didn't say, "You were screaming again", I would never know I did it. I'm sure my neighbours get annoyed with it, but I have to live somewhere.<br>  <br>  Maybe find out *why* he's screaming before deciding what to do would be a good idea.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I would 1st talk to the parent & say is everything all right b/c I keep hearing your son screaming at night maybe the boy suffers from Night Terrors but making the Mom aware of this hopefully will prompt her to do something if not you can call Child Protective Service to check for abuse also the call is anonymous|`|QI74CxD0aa	Perhaps there is child abuse of some sort going on.   If you suspect that, it would be best to report it.  If the child has a medical problem, then it is also a concern.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	You know I would have said that maybe the boy is having "night Terrors" most time the child will sit up with their eyes open and scream for no reason.most times the children have no recollection if the nightly event and it isn't harmful but can be pretty damn scary for the parents. But since the child is screaming for an hour I would be a little more concerned.<br>  This could be child abuse, but since the walls are so thin you would be able to hear through the walls if the child was being beaten. To me it sounds like the KID is just a brat and this is how he is getting his parents attention. Children will strive for any attention even if it's negative.<br>  I would talk to the Mother calmly and explain that you were woken by her sons screaming and is everything alright? If that doesn't work call the police and they can get to the bottom of it.|`|AA10188961	That's such a tough question.  If you do go to the parents, they may punish him instead of getting him help.  Same with if you go to the landlord.  I think you need to weigh how badly this is impacting your life.  If you are losing sleep and it starts to effect job perfomance and what not, you need to do something like talk to the parents or your landlord.   If you're awake anyway and its just annoying, maybe you need to grin and bear it.|`|sKw5GeeMaa	first of all you have to find out WHY he is screaming.<br>  the parents obviously have no idea what to do about their own kid.<br>  have you talked to the parents? perhaps they dont realize it bothers you or the other neighbors.if the child is having bad dreams then tell them to play some soft music while he sleeps.|`|d748d8e10f1d98d96305ada8117301ebaa	Is there something wrong with the boy?  You should not have to grin and bear it. so speak to the landlord.  If you think it is abuse, then call the police when he is screaming.  They will hear it at the other end of the phone.

Alot of people think that to be emo you have to be depressed and cut yourself but that's not true. Its just a stereotype.  And you feel like anyone else does you just have a different style and that's it. Its about being different which means you listen to different music and you try to stand out.
3J6KaUg8aa	Transvestite is used to describe one who cross-dresses--go to Laura's Playground -it is an interesting non porn site with lots of information on transgendered people. Give it a try - you will learn some things that most people never take time to learn.|`|AA12006309	They could be considered pansexual - as their relationship is obviously genderblind - or simply "queer".  It depends on how they define their gender identity.<br>  <br>  Example:  I consider myself transgender, my gender identity is third gender.  I'm biologically female, but I dress daily and present as male.  My sexual orientation is pansexual - I'm genderblind.  I don't consider gender to be a factor in deciding on a partner, who can be anywhere on the gender spectrum.  I am non-operative.<br>  <br>  My partner is a heterosexual man.  People who wouldn't know better would consider us to be a heterosexual couple, but that's not the case.  Despite what biology says, I'm not a woman, so our relationship can't be heterosexual.  Typically, I simply use the term "queer" and leave it at that.  By definition, it would be pansexuality or omnisexuality.<br>  <br>  If, in your example, the crossdresser still identified as their biological gender (ex: if they crossdress as the opposite gender, but still identify as their biological gender), they would still be a heterosexual couple.<br>  <br>  Your orientation is defined by the attraction of your gender identity, not your biology. Hope this helps. :)|`|fa8e5af2b3888bd282c5c04cf11e8927aa	A transvestite.

Jobs like a DMV worker or an IRS agent are such examples.  Other jobs that enforce policies against a certain group of people (like a judge against criminals) is frowned upon.  Hence, dependent upon the group of people from whose point of view a job is seen, anyone with that job may be considered to be of a negative view.  So, a boss may be disliked or looked down upon by his/her employees, while his/her own boss may consider them to be an asset to the company.<br>  <br>  The idea that a job has a negative connotation to society as a whole, however, is definitely present with people who have jobs that are meant to enforce laws or policies.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Government Cheese|`|s6GKHKccaa	Fast Food; Restaurant occupations.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I don't think that I can generalize about an entire generation.  However, I can say that our schools are doing a terrible job at educating our youth.<br>  <br>  Children are generally in school more than they are with their parents or any one else.  The schools have tremendous influence on our youth.  Most of our youth is simply following the path that they have been taught by our schools.  It is only natural.<br>  <br>  Yet, I am seeing some very basic things that are being left out.  I can't count how many questions I've seen asking about our Democracy in the US (we are actually a Republic).  Or on the subject of global warming, the schools have only taught one side of this theory.  They've never been told that there are plenty of scientists who are against it.  There are quite a few areas where the teachers are obviously only teaching one viewpoint instead of all views.<br>  <br>  Our youth is definitely human and they are simply following what they were taught.  If they were taught that socialism is a good thing, then I strongly disagree.|`|BfDM12ptaa	if sex for fun,drugs and extra vulgur clothes are 'right'...then they are on path<br>  but still independence and rebel behavoir impresses me..todays youth are tough<br>  they understand more practically....so 50-50|`|N4Hktfmnaa	You?

2PZnXjZ7aa	Myths are merely entertaining stories and ancient explanations of things.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	aliens. yes there are other life forms on other planets in other universes. whether they are green or not. they have to exist.<br>  <br>  wizards - there are witches, i am a witch. i can't make things float but i am sure people who aren't wizards/witches have telekinesis and can do that..<br>  <br>  vampires - i have met 2 vampires. real true vampires. they aren't glittery   but they are real vampires. not those 'psychic' ones.|`|m89kGXBnaa	The origin of myths has been heavily discussed. Take vampires. The most logical explaination is not that there are a few vampires but the myth arose out of misunderstanding of the process of decay (i.e. blood falling to the back of the body, bloating, rigor mortis and release, etc) and not knowing the germ theory of disease. TB is a regular candidate for what are recorded as "vampire attacks" (seeming to go through families, causes weakness, paleness, etc). Whole books have been written on the subject, and it's rather fascinating without resorting to actual vampires.<br>  <br>  Aliens - well, as someone else once said - either we're alone in the universe or we're not, and either way that's rather mindblowing....<br>  <br>  Wizards - misunderstand of, depending on where you are - druidic rites (which were not well recorded, and involved drugs) or shaimanistic rites. But not telekinesis, which would, if it existed, re-write physics and despite such obvious advantage to demonstrating it, has never been shown in a controlled laboratory condition.

m89kGXBnaa	NO! You've confused him the Helius, who rode across the sky with the sun on a chariot and was the sun in effect. (To the land of evenings, where he sailed back in a golden cup - why, I don't know - to where his sister Eos (dawn) would welcome him.) He was a Titan, which is a God.<br>  <br>  Apollo was god of of prophecy and oracles, healing, plague and disease, music, song and poetry, archery, and the protection of the young (see second source) but not the sun. In later sources, he became confused with Helios, but there's no evidence the Greeks myths ever regarded them as the same (see the wiki page)|`|AA12093934	Some what he rode across the sky in a chariot with horses... so i guess yes    <br>  <br>  <br>  =)

You just feel more comfortable in them. Now if the question also included " And I find myself being attracted to boys" maybe so. But it didn't. If wearing women's clothes makes you feel your best, rock on!|`|avfdeyxNaa	Only you know why you wear her clothes. But just know that wearing them does NOT make you bi or gay. It could be that you're a crossdresser, meaning you like to dress up as the opposite sex, but it doesn't change your orientation.<br>  <br>  Hey, if you like it, whatever works for you. Just be yourself.|`|1d685074fadc5c403a481e6292e4eb56aa	I would really like to know, because my little brother used to go so far as to wear my panties. Which is so gross, he would also use my perfume.

Do you like to look pretty or something?|`|X5pFnRZpaa	I think you want to be a girl.|`|7VBdPtIQaa	do you feel more comfortable in them?|`|uSW53DKAaa	Because you express yourself through clothing. There's a feminine part of you that wants to come out, even if just in clothing. It could be something more-- perhaps you are transgender. You may be a transvestite, a transexual, or just effeminate. <br>  <br>  I think you should buy yourself something nice that's *just* yours. Don't keep borrowing your sister's clothes all the time.|`|jsUZFHhcaa	You may be A Transgender person.

Most have reported a very unpleasant noise at the beginning.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, hallucinations brought on by a dying brain are really not a good source of proof for your religion...|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	How do Protestant Christians explain the testimonies of Catholics who were met in near death by Mary? <br>  <br>  Christians who believe in hell (consciously or subconsiously) *and* who die with feelings of guilt or intense fear are very likely to manufacture an image of hell. The majority of cases are, however, probably pure fabrication.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Trauma and lack of oxygen to the brain can cause hallucinations.  This has been known for decades.|`|RedEGIfZaa	Oxygen deprivation.|`|eF92uM2Saa	Several years ago, I read about some study explaining what causes hallucinations as the brain shuts down during what is commonly called a near death experience.   If makes sense that the contents of such hallucinations are associated with the culture (including religion) of the person undergoing the experience. It also makes sense that when someone's brain has been scrambled and she is trying to make sense of what just happened, she might create a memory of the event from a suggestion.  For instance, someone might say, "OMG, she almost died, she was dead!" within ear shot of the person just waking up in a hospital room.  Then the person waking would try and think about what they remembered, taking the jumble, trying to make sense of it.  Religious imagery would come in very handy to her brain.|`|O1xSW736aa	NDE's sometimes result in the brain running wild with no sensory input, similar to a dream (or drug induced hallucinations).  Its a well studied topic and there are plenty of people have NDE's without seeing heaven, hell, dead relatives etc.<br>  <br>  Oxygen starvation or hypoxia can cause many of these symptoms as demonstrated by Michael Portillo on the BBC Horizon programme "How To Kill A Human Being". <br>  <br>  No mystery, no mumbo jumbo, no hell.|`|LF4vun1maa	I can account for *all* NDE's, from people of all faiths,  as hallucinations caused by intense psychological and physical stress on the brain and interpreted with influence from the religion of the victim.<br>  <br>  How does a theist account for NDE's if they are real, when many of them contradict your specific faith?|`|AA12382198	I don't understand what one has to do with the other.<br>  <br>  Near Death.....has nothing to do with Hell.<br>  <br>  Since no one has ever come back to tell us what's on the other side.....if anything.....who really knows.|`|5rP0zBudaa	If you are nearly dead the brain has likely suffered a trauma or has been deprived of oxygen.

AA10153636	You need to back off and let your mother (parents) run the home.<br>  When you pay the bills then you can call the shots.   Until you move out you need to submit to their authority or her as the case may be..  Telling her that you want to be something else won't make your home life easier and will only make life worse for both of you.  You don't have to lie, but you also don't have to bring up things that make for fights.   <br>  Either that or move out.   then do what you want..  <br>  <br>  If you don't like being controlled now, wait until you have to pay your taxes, register your car, and do all the other things that the Govt. puts on you, like the draft if it comes.  <br>  Go to AA for families, they can help you.|`|AA11796124	<<How to tell My close minded Catholic Mother that I'm Agnostic?>><br>  <br>  The fact your mother is Catholic does not mean she's close-minded.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Im a junior in High school, and My Family (especially my mom) is very Catholic. I haven't considered myself catholic since my freshman year. Im agnostic.>><br>  <br>  "Freshman year"? In Junior High? What is that, the sixth grade or something?<br>  <br>  <br>  <<But my mom is pressuring me to be confirmed and that, to me, will mean defeat.>><br>  <br>  While obeying your parents may seem like "defeat" to you, it's actually helps one succeed. To be a good leader, you must first learn to follow.<br>  <br>  Obey your parents, period.<br>  It's easy to do when your wishes are in sync with your parents'. It's a different story when your wills are differnt, but therein lies the dignity of obeying a higher authority.<br>  <br>  Again, to be a good leader, you must first learn to follow. A bad follower will NEVER become a good leader.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<My mother isn't a bad person but the last time I hinted at not being a good catholic (prop 8 issue) she flipped out. She was drinking and the next morning she yelled "Your never going to that school again" because "The Liberal teachers are putting this **** in your head".

No political ideology is "perfect", but liberalism poisons the mind more than any other.<br>  <br>  Your mother "flipping out" and using harsh language wasn't necessary. She should have behaved with a bit more dignity. Having said that, her lack of dignity does not justify yours.<br>  <br>  If she "flips out" again, show yourself to be the bigger person by maintining yourself and a civil tongue.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Whenever I did something wrong she never blamed me. She blames someone else for "corrupting my mind" or influencing me. When I was young and never got in trouble, I kind of liked it. But now, I feel disrespected.>><br>  <br>  When you were younger, you were innocent. Much of the time, when you did something wrong, it was probably because you didn't know better.<br>  <br>  Now, as an adolescent, you are old enough to think you know something, when you are not yet old enough to know everything.<br>  <br>  You think you should be treated as an equal when you are still under the authority of your parents. You might not like that, but this disdain only proves how ill-prepared you are to make your own choices.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<This really sucks because my best friend is an atheist (she thinks they're all the same) and might call him, or his parents, blame him and never let us hang out anymore (Im out of a ride for the rest of the year)(also me and my best friend have something stronger than normal. We're Blood Brothers. So we will still hang at school).>><br>  <br>  You don't have to tell your parents that your friend is an atheist - unless they were to ask.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<I hate being controlled, I've been very depressed since a horrible experience called "steubenville". I cant keep lying to my mothers face. <br>  How do I tell her? How Can I confront Her about it?>><br>  <br>  So long as you are still living under your parents' roof, you are subject to their authority. Not until you've got your own place should you tell them about your lack of Faith.<br>  You can't really "confront" your parents on this issue until you're an adult.<br>  <br>  Atheism is not the best path.

The thing I find very unfortunate here is that you are rejecting God because your mom is an alcoholic and it is leaving you with a bad taste about religion. That is very sad. You should try to go to Al a non meetings. This is for people who have to live with alcoholics. If you are underage that is not much you can do without upsetting your mom. I truly hope that you stop and think for a moment about your own relationship to God apart from your mom's.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	If it was me, I would just play along.<br>  I'd go to church and all that just to make my mother happy, even though I know it's not real. <br>  <br>  If you don't believe in it, then the rituals mean nothing. <br>  <br>  That's just me though.|`|QSMotfDUaa	just say it<br>  its going to hurt<br>  but its your choice to live a lie or just say it<br>  <br>  i told my mom i was atheist my freshmen year<br>  for a year or so she lived in denial<br>  now she accepts it<br>  she loves me just the same<br>  shes a catholic too|`|e83ef8578f7a57c84bd152a9c428feb2aa	You will have to have a sit down chat with her. Tell her that you have given the idea of God a lot of thought, and determined that there is no evidence for it. You realize that it is rational and acceptable to live a good life without a belief in a supernatural deity. Explain that our morals come from society and the evolution of humans interacting with other humans.<br>  Also you should mention that; if irrefutable evidence of a God ever presents itself, you would obviously believe in that God, however that is not likely to happen. Just as we are not likely to see evidence of Zeus, Apollo, or faeries.

We do it because we want to make the world a better place.  And as staggeringly impossible as the task seems, eliminating religion, or at the very least, the power of religion to extend beyond itself and affect the world at large, is arguably the best thing mankind could do to improve the world.<br>  <br>  Despite what your fellow Christians believe, you guys DO NOT have a monopoly on Religion and Spirituality.  You can have one and not the other.  Or you can have neither, but still have your life be severely impacted by people who have both.  If you REALLY want to get down to brass tacks... one could argue:<br>  <br>  With the advent of the internet and exponential increase in the amount of shared knowledge and speed with which that information can be shared and discussed, those that ascribe no belief in controlling supernatural entities have begun to realize the negative affect that Religion and Spirituality has on the entire world, including them, without consent.  Therefore many non-believers consider it their right, if not their duty, to stand up and argue against those ideas.  <br>  <br>  It was religious people who came up with the idea that religion is an "untouchable subject" and that it is wrong to refute or argue against it.  Telling atheists (you don't have to capitalize that, btw, but thanks for the thought) that they shouldn't be allowed to voice their opinions on religion because they aren't religious is like telling citizens that they shouldn't be allowed to discuss/debate/argue politics because they aren't politicians.|`|QKs0PFVpaa	Whinny christian.

Humans, however, can not be demons, devils, or fallen angels.  If you are consumed by & dedicated to sin & evil, the best you can hope for is to be a damned soul--not exactly a wise career choice.

k1W70RHFaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist, but I'm pretty darn conservative on fiscal issues.

I don't say it for shock value, it is the truth.  I think atheism and Marxism go together well.  I fact, I think that if it weren't for some set of rules that people have an irrational attachment to, like the rules of a religion, the greed that they learn from the time they are young; the greed that builds from the time they are told that the point of having a job is to earn money; would lead every capitalist to do absolutely ANYTHING for money, including murder and steal.  Capitalism can't function without an omnipresent enforcer.  The downfall of religion will be the rise of Marxism, as Marx predicted.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Because we expect atheists to be rational?? j/k LOL<br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, most atheists I know support the equal rights of gays, a woman's right to choose, not sacrificing civil liberties for "national security" and many other things that conservatives and Republicans vote against.

Many atheists are socially non-extreme conservatives to moderates and fiscally conservative.  It's a pity that that arm of the Republican Party has been pushed aside while the Religious Right did its damage.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	I suppose most people see atheists as thinking through their beliefs, which would preclude being a republican.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Our ideology is more fundamental than our religious belief system.  Christian liberals like me have much more in common with liberal atheists than with Christian conservatives (we suspect they don't even worship the same God).  To be honest, if you voted for Obama I don't care what God you do or don't believe in.  And I'm not even an American!<br>  <br>  Without wishing to be rude, the conservative atheists I meet tend to be less well educated than the liberals, and parrot the usual line (there's no God/the Church is full of hypocrites/religion starts all the wars in the world) without having thought it through.   I think there's a natural progression from evangelical to liberal to atheist; but people become atheists in many ways.  It also strikes me that many hardcore conservatives are deeply religious people even if they are atheist: they worship the flag, they worship the Market, they worship their country, and these entities have a divine status for them.  Christians call this idolatry.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	Most Atheists do seem liberal.  I recently had breakfast with a group of Atheists and there was a Republican Atheist amongst us. <br>  <br>  If you are a mildly conservative you might be considered somewhat liberal in today's Republican party.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I was thinking about that the other day.

I have a very strong testimony of the Book of Mormon and our beliefs that are in addition to the Bible.<br>  <br>  One thing I keep in mind when thinking about things like physics, arguments by atheists, or prophecies that contradict truth is that Satan will tell 9 truths to get you to believe one lie.

They share views with so many other religions, and accept any form. Yeah they seem like ***** because the push all their beleifs on everyone, and they seem like they aren't tolerant.

The vast majority who value the symbolic nature of the Bible have an open mind to the fact that the Christian Creed isn't 100% firm and is open to interpretation.

Also there was a mob of them, not just one or two, but over 40.  How would you feel surrounded like that?<br>  <br>  In mocking God’s servants you blaspheme him, as did the mob of children that taunted Elisha by saying, “Go up, thou bald head.” Jehovah caused bears to claw forty-two of those juvenile delinquents.—2?Ki. 2:23, 24.<br>  <br>  21 That may seem severe treatment for calling someone a baldhead, but more than disrespect was involved. It was the taunt “Go up” that called for divine vengeance. It was telling Elisha to go up as he reported Elijah did. (2?Ki. 2:11) It showed disbelief in Jehovah’s miracle in Elijah’s case, and was a taunt for Elisha to prove it by duplicating it. It could also indicate that Elisha should go up as did Elijah and in that way the community would be rid of him. It suggested that his presence was unwanted and for him to clear out of the territory. It is likely that adults were responsible for this delinquency, the childish taunting being a reflection of the adult attitude if it was not directly instigated by religiously opposed adults. At any rate, the children were punished for their blasphemy. As Proverbs 20:11 states: “Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.” Youthfulness alone does not save delinquents who blaspheme, as shown by the command given Jehovah’s executional forces at Armageddon: “Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women.”—Ezek. 9:5, 6.<br>  <br>  The other could be a figment of someones imagination, for I've never read where anyone cut babies from the womb, at least none that were following God.  It sounds more like sensationalism from another source.<br>  <br>  Now let the thumbs down begin.  :)|`|l2FOLWvnaa	I know the section on Elijah to be somewhat violent, but can't be more specific than that.|`|5shqstYraa	This sound like some militaries and some doctors|`|gZ0NPuleaa	It is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool trusting in his own folly.

And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them<br>  <br>  Those children are not children, but "young men " from 20-40 years of age. <br>  They were smart mouthing a servant of the LORD,  Elisha.
mQ3ku8y2aa	well since your not looking for something online than the best way is to just wait I guess I mean if u arent open to people at your school than guys who are bi or gay wont really be into you because they dont want to say something to you and offend you if you know what I mean other than that just give it time things like this are hard for even straight people love is something that takes time and even longer to build a relationship. Also like one of the others said join GSA its a great way to meet other gays and bi's or what have you but sometimes GSA doesnt work so follow your heart and give it time|`|QJRK8yltaa	Try joining your school's GSA, if there is one in your school. Otherwise, just try to be outgoing with your friends. You never know who you'll run into :) Places like parties, the movies, and Starbucks are great potential "scouting" areas.<br>  <br>  As to online dating, it could work, but keep in mind that a lot of people are just looking for one night stands or friends with benefits. These people usually aren't really interested in serious relationships|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	I'm in the same situation and don't really know how to find any gay/bi guys who I could date...<br>  <br>  I guess it'll happen when it happens... just hope it's soon!<br>  <br>  :)|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Cheat rooms, but be care full there are a lot of freaks and predators in there. I think your best bet is going to a local gay clubs or bars. meet face to face in a public place. Good luck and I hope you find some one.

52VDjbNTaa	Yeah.<br>  I'm not sure if I'm bisexual, lesbian or pansexual.<br>  And on the Kinsey scale, I could be anywhere from 2 to 6.<br>  I think it's that I don't know whether society has made me like men, or I actually like them.<br>  I definitely like girls.|`|x7uRjwseaa	Not so much confused about it, than realizing that people would hate me for it. That is some what depressing.|`|DIj072Sqaa	I wouldn't say confused but resistant. If there was any significant element of choice then I would have opted to be straight but that's not my nature. I don't like taking labels and 'gay' is a bit too simplistic so I identify as being around 5 on the Kinsey scale - almost exclusively homosexual|`|24W08urlaa	Yes. I've been struggling with my orientation for years. I've gotten so much better with it, but sometimes I just think I'm wrong in thinking I'm a lesbian because being straight would be so much easier. But I know its who I am, and I just need to accept it. It's all about pushing off people's opinions for me now, that's my big issue.|`|OKdA3oYVaa	I don't think i was confused i just dawned on me why i was feeling like that and that i wasn't weird. i was just relived to be told that i didn't have to hide away.|`|DIqqgNaVaa	yes i was for a while but i have been raised on the idea that heterosexuality is the norm and that homosexuality was pure evil so im not confused anymore just scared|`|eGtZXgRHaa	You know, this can be explained in so many ways. Just think about a young gay man right ? Well, at first he's confused, doesn't know what's happening... not sure about what he wants. At a young age, it is probably 'cause of the hormones, going up & down. He's discovering his sexuality, and depending on how old he is, he might not even be sure of what homosexuality really is (what we hear at school isn't always the best sexual education we could have... lol). Now, same guy, older, still confused. He now knows exactly what homosexuality is, and also knows how gay men are laughed at. He could now be in denial of himself. 'Cause hey ? A lot of gay people would prefer, if they had a choice, to be straight, and not because it's not right to be gay, not at all ! But let's be honest... it's not something that's always easy to deal with. So maybe that man wish he wasn't gay, and refuse to be. He refuses so bad to be gay that in is subconscious he kinda stop even thinking about it and consider himself as straight. But ! The problem is, even though he kinda don't know what's going on ('cause homosexuality isn't even an option for him) he is confused, 'cause something's feeling wrong but he doesn't know what exactly.<br>  <br>  That's just an example why someone could be confused about his sexual orientation, but there are many others. I hope this will help you understand ! See ya ;)|`|e6zJFfd8aa	well when i first decided i wasn't straight i said i was bi then i went out with this girl and i realized i wasn't ready for a girl relationship but i was still attracted to girls so i was confused then i waited a while and dated another girl and things went really well so i decided i was bi then i found myself attracted to someone who was trans so i decided on pansexuality|`|avfdeyxNaa	Yeah, cuz the world tells you one thing while all the while you're feeling another......and if you like guys and girls both, sometimes you struggle to make yourself fit into either the gay or straight category and it makes you all idhbfieyghenrfkdbhksjnfkihrg for awhile......Well....that's how I felt about it. But I'm pretty sure of myself now (:|`|jzMM8imyaa	I was confused for a while just cuz I felt sexually attracted to guys but I wanted to live up to the expectations society placed on me. I mean, girls were all over me. But I wasn't really into it.<br>  <br>  Now my problem is finding the right guy. lol I'm not too into the more feminine guys.|`|uSW53DKAaa	It was really just a matter of going, "Oh, that's what that is." <br>  <br>  I was really confused about my gender for a long time. It seems simpler now, but I haven't got it completely figured out yet.|`|GR3QVqGXaa	idk|`|NXy8SnVJaa	yes<br>  and i still am<br>  <br>  so, you're not alone|`|nmwdQ6bQaa	nooooooooooo i don't think so|`|fjPReUltaa	No, I haven't been confused about my orientation. However, in the past, I have wanted to fit in and like boys instead of girls.
6ELSwKKvaa	Oh yes,  this happens. In a round about way... my daughter tried to come out to me at 5 years old when she told me she wanted to marry her female teacher. I just thought it was a child really liking her teacher until at age 10, there were some letters that surfaced which were about her feelings toward members of the same sex. (Some other kids parents found the letters and my daughter wanted me to talk to the woman because her mom told her she couldn't talk to my daughter anymore because of them. - Before I called, I asked her to be honest about what was in the letters as I don't like to be blindsided. That's when she told me)<br>  <br>   After that she told some of her friends who had a less than favorable reaction so she told them she was bisexual. Now that she is 15 and in High School with a support system in place, she is out to about 80% of the people. She has told my entire family but holds back on telling her dad's family because she is afraid of how they would react.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To NICK- The point of coming out is so that you can freely have a boyfriend and introduce them to your parents without all heck breaking loose. It is so that when you have a picture of your boyfriend next to your bed, it doesn't confuse your parents. The only reason one needs to come out is because most heterosexuals put them in a closet and they don't' understand them. They automatically put them in the closet by expecting to have a straight child.|`|cuIX13BKaa	Yes...but I have most everyone here beat by a decade or two. The gas thing is that my Father was a geneticist/biologist and in the 60's and 70's was conducting DNA tests alone with government funds. It ws inconclusive for what he had to work with.....but you can imagine our household speaking of thee things as though they were no different than a current good read on someones part. I knew several children....say most likely adolescents who came out....and yes it was often seen in younger children too. When we do NOT put the shame or notions of being an aberration in front of homosexuality then it is nothing so strange for the young people to understand....they are far wiser than given credit for. The families that i know presently treat this as though it is just another facet of their wonderful child's persona. generally the youngest will be late Middle School or Early High School. For me I was 10...but sometimes it is apparent from the word 'Go'~ Great question!<br>  <br>  Garbo|`|oVeGMNsLaa	You should watch the documentary "Bi The Way" . . . it features 11-year old Josh Caouette, a kid in Texas who came out as bisexual.|`|QeTPWhf7aa	Yes.  I came out at 13 years old and parents didn't believe me. Im 14 now. I guess im goanna have to come out again someday. I think coming out is stupid, No Offense. I mean what's the point of walking around announcing "Im Gay"?<br>  <br>  I Know your gonna give me a thumbs down :(|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	I actually know someone who came out at 9. It wasn't as dramatic, she just said, from what she told me: "Mom, I like girls". Without knowing what she did.|`|lPPgMKibaa	it happened in my case... well nvm, im 13.|`|16hw2Xkzaa	Children are coming out at much younger ages.  Just this year alone there was a school in Colorado and another in Pennsylvania that had elementary students who came out.  Both schools have been in the news as to how they are dealing with the questions that other parents are bringing to the schools.  I'm sure that if you google the topic you will find information on this.  Also, 20/20 did an hour long special hosted by Barbra Walters last November that was just on the topic of young children coming out, some as early as 4 and 5.  I know many TGs who will tell you that their experiences started at about 8-9 yrs. of age.|`|rh2cRpMHaa	I've never heard of anyone coming out that early, and I wouldn't recommend it, since you can't really be sure at that age, in my honest opinion.|`|hw2Cr5Jqaa	Yeah,<br>  I knew someone that told her parents she was gay at the age of 5. They didnt believe her and now then think its there fault for not 'stamping out the gay'<br>  <br>  Ugh.. I hate people like that,|`|g6BCMd1Uaa	I would imagine somewhere in Arkansas it happens frequently. Anything goes there.|`|AA11355027	YES!!

RedEGIfZaa	Yes, because an amateur "treasure seeker" is comparable to virtually every biologist in the world, who will, by the way, tell you that evolution is a fact..|`|NLinPsyhaa	Pretty much. I have been told that a fossil is like a snap shot of the past. But with a picture, a lot can be inferred. If I took a picture of my back yard right now, you wouldn't know from the picture if it was fall, winter, or early spring. Science only wants to jump to conclusions that evolution is true only to deny a creator and that we have a purpose for being here.

If you look at some people today (i have seen quite a few), you would swear they escaped from the museum of natural history.

We evolved? look around, we just have new and better ways to kill each other. the first humans to walk this planet were GENIUSES that developed MUSIC, LANGUAGE, WRITING, The WHEEL, METAL, etc. we are just expanding on their discovery.<br>  Almost ALL the diseases we have today, we picked up from EATING MEAT.<br>  the first humans were genetically pure and probably did live to be a thousand years old. there were no diseases.

It's ALL. Transitional fossils do not exist, except in the imaginations of those who see "transitional life forms."<br>  <br>  I have absolutely no doubt that we have fossils of extinct species...But evolution is a religion, not science...All you have to do to see this is look at Richard Dawkins on Wikipedia...Although I beg forgiveness for quoting Wikipedia.<br>  <br>  Gen 1:24  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. <br>  Gen 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <br>  Gen 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. <br>  Gen 1:27  So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.|`|cCmVqzAUaa	Thanks for that question.  Something just occurred to me while reading your question.  Evolutionists say that basically evolution has this almost haphazard quality to it.  There's this mutation, or adaptation that takes place and if it's conducive to the environment it's in, then it survives while those that don't adapt, die.  There's a line in the gospel of John where Jesus says,"The wind (aka the Holy Spirit) blows where it will, and you hear the sound, but can't tell where it comes from and where it goes; so to is every one that is born of the Spirit." (John 3:8).  It seems kind of haphazard, and that burial shroud that he was buried in seemed, in a way, to be a fossil.  I think that being 'born again' or 'begotten from above" could be that next stage of evolution.  It seems to be one of those haphazard traits conducive to survival and life.  Eternal life.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Are you really claiming Neanderthals are a hoax?

dbGliL4Uaa	Well, Doc, you're closer to a punk rocker  than to other tribes; enjoying knowledge and sci-fi (on a realistic, anti-establishment basis) doesn't makes one a nerd. Knowledge is power, and wondering what other realities it (as technology) could bring into this dead-end world of ours sure stirs the imagination. I love the Beatles myself and I'm a raging (and aging) red Latin American peasant trade union organizer. Yeah, go figure that out... So what? Once you grow older you realize labeling is for kids, who everywhere try desperately to belong to some tribe, because family and commmunity and nation are as bankrupt as the financial system. Just be what you like and let people love you like that, or freak themselves. Once you get this degree of self-assurance, others who have done the same congregate around you, and you'll be no longer alone. And even if you are, it won' bother you so much. Never mind what other people think about you unless they are pointing guns at you or pay your bills. That's why I avoid being at gunpoint and work hard to pay my way through life.

7F57Ovlfaa	to christians everything is a sin unless they do it|`|liGEQEz4aa	yes, but here's the thing: we're all responsible for ourselves.   If anyone sets out deliberately to antagonize anyone else, it's a sin.  If the intention to antagonize is absent, then it is not a sin.  I can be going about my business, without any intention of antagonizing anyone, and someone may walk up to me and thank me for what I'm doing and the positive impact it has on their life and someone else may walk up to me and scream indignities to my face for what I'm doing and the antagonism it creates in their life.  Am I responsible for one person's antagonism or are they?  I say they are.  We have all to be responsible for our own reactions and feeling, perceptions, etc. and learn to give the benefit of the doubt because after all, that's what we would want from others.  If someone is truly out to antagonize, it will become evident because people always tell us who they are eventually.  If we find ourselves antagonized by someone, we have several choices: we can go confront them in a polite and civilized way and tell them what effect they have on us and why, or we can simply go elsewhere, away from them.  If neither works, and the situation is severe, we can go over their heads to someone in authority to them and try to get a change, but that would be only under seriously severe circumstances....like IRS refuses to give you your rightly due refund or some such....On this site, it's usually clear who is just trying to antagonize Christians or Muslims or really any religious group.  I see lots of people who are genuinely antagonized because Christians don't believe as they do, and that is truly not justified antagonism; it's disrespectful toward Christians.  Antagonism is a very personal thing, and should be accepted as the personal responsibility of the each individual.  If I am antagonized by someone, I do what I've just outlined.  I either go away, or bring up the issue to the person involved.  To become equally antagonistic is sinful.  Christians are taught to do good to those who do us evil.  Is that always easy: no.  Do those who are abusive to us try to use that to their advantage.  They try at times.  Should we let them? Well, no.  We are also taught to admonish evil and expose it.  We can expose evil, forgive it and do good to those who do us evil....and still be living within what Christianity teaches.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	The Bible tells Christians to do whatever they can to get along with others.

Usually we are masculine, liking masculine dress and activities, such as cooking and mechanical work, but not always. We tend to take a dominant role in relationships.  But not always.  We tend to like "fems", feminine lesbians, but not always, (I like butch women more than fems), some are bi and some can actually be straight.  (Those that like men however, are usually attracted to gay or bi men).  We also tend to prefer butch, Dyke, or queer to the word lesbian, but not always.

AA11598520	You know, when the priest read that the people were wondering "How can this man forgive sins when only God can forgive sins," I was thinking the same thing, but I think this was just to point out that Jesus was God since he was forgiving him. <br>  <br>  You DO have a point, though, because the reason we have confession is to remind us that God forgives us. Many times we ask forgiveness but we don't let ourselves off the hook nearly as quickly as God does. The priest is there to make sure we keep that in mind and not hold onto our sins longer than God holds on to them. <br>  <br>  Of course we must be crazy! There couldn't possibly have been BIBLICAL readings at mass since we aren't bible-based and have nothing whatsoever to do with the bible. LOL|`|biPAZ2TVaa	A priest cant forgive sins because he is a sinner himself. How would you know if your sins are forgiven.

They'd only bug me if I thought they were right about things which we disagree on.|`|bRBZ5KX3aa	i thought jesus spoke pretty explicitly about being self-righteous|`|C0xGFq2Qaa	LOL<br>  Most Protestants wrongly and blindly think that we attribute the forgiveness of sins to the man of the priest.  They don't understand that we see the priest as a consort of God, a person acting as his Advocate.<br>  It's funny because they'll also assert that no person can act as such for God, but if God doesn't work through people, then what was Moses doing, or Elija.  And why do we call The Blessed Virgin our Divine Advocate?<br>  Another thing that we believe is that Christ was the first and most perfect priest.  He passed on the priesthood and leadership of the religion to Peter and then the other apostles who then passed it down through the ages.  In this way we, as a Church, have direct apostolic succession and a Divine beginning. <br>  The priest does not forgive our sins, God does.  But the priest, as an advocate of God has God work His wonders through him.  The purpose of confession with a priest as oppossed to confession through prayer (which most protestants prefer and argue) is that it is easy enough to say you are sorry for a sin, but in repenting to a man, a person humbles themself and makes an act of repentence.|`|kJMLIH89aa	Actually most protestants I know frown upon TV evangelists. And I think the real issue is that evangelicals, when they think of a priest forgiving someone through confession, they have the idea that the priest as a person or human being separate from God is performing this. And if you think about it like that it does sound wrong. But correct me if I'm wrong, God is doing the forgiving through the priest. The priest does not have the Power to forgive sins. But God has the power to use his followers Priest or not through the common priesthood to provide people with forgiveness. <br>  <br>  Actually I had never heard of this issue. But confessional is definitely not a wrong practice. The bible says to confess your sins and to confess with your mouth. Basically meaning let it be known, tell someone whether it be a priest or directly to God. Confessing your sins is how you are forgiven by God.<br>  <br>  On the subject of miraculous healing. God does do some pretty abrupt things. I know in my life I'vee seen some things that there are no other explanation other than divine intervention. Sometimes God speaks to us in a completely obvious way or does things like miraculous healing. <br>  <br>  I do think evangelicals may get caught up in life though. As I said many protestants aren't fond of what they do.<br>  <br>  I hope you can use this for idk learning or something? Just a honest thought from another Christian.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Back on the topic of Priests and forgiveness. rukidding provided an excellent point. People do have a tendency to not forgive themselves. God forgives you right away and he forgets about it right away. Humans are incapable of this. When you confess to someone its much more comforting to and easy to forgive yourself when someone physically says it. I mentioned before that sometimes God has tools to forgive and to give us comfort. He doesn't necessarily just make you feel good *poof* he will use other people to carry out his will. Therefore providing a sense of forgiveness through a Priest.<br>  <br>  and to the person with the screen name just a christian:<br>  Your answer seemed very rude and unorganized<br>  You offered very little explained input. Contrary to popular belief Christianity involves a lot of logic and your post contained scripture with no personal application to the subject.<br>  <br>  And a message to everyone Catholic and Protestant alike. I am going to say it from a Protestants standpoint because that is who I am. You say protestants as if all of us are against you in our beliefs (may sound a bit extreme and I say this in the most respectful way possible) I have never met a strong christian protestant that believes that the Catholic traditions and practices are wrong. I think the reason protestant may say things like what you are bringing up are because (and this is opinion) we separate ourselves. We have Baptists, and Catholics, and Lutherans, and whatever. Regardless of who broke away from whom we are all Christians. And when people belong to a certain group Protestant or Catholic, that tend to think that the Practices of the other are wrong because they don't do them. Example (this is fictional) "I think Catholicism is wrong because protestants don't have confessional" That is total BUNK! The only reason people think things like this is because we have a separate "titles." So the idea is that if we have separate title we believe separate things, and therefore the other person is wrong. <br>  <br>  For the record I am protestant.<br>  <br>  Like sunsandnrain said were letting all these minuscule things drive us apart and then we start thinking the other is wrong. Which is not true.<br>  <br>  And I'm not saying the whole "there's more than one way to get to heaven, we can do it our own way" I dont believe that. That is not true the only way to get to heaven is ask for the Salvation that God is offering us and stop bickering and complaining that a certain denomination said this or that. The bible tells us word for word on how to get to heaven and as far as I know we all believe its the same way.<br>  <br>  I want you to know that I dont only say this from the perspective of a Protestant, but also from the truthes I have found about Catholics. Growing up I was told that Catholics do not believe in salvation through Jesus. I believed this because a person who was important to me told me this. I have come to realize, and so has the person that told me this, that that statement is completely untrue. Catholics do believe in Jesus and the only reason I believd that was because I grew up thinking that. <br>  <br>  A big reason that people from different denominations think the other is wrong is because of examples like this. They are told something totally false and believe it as they grow up. And since what they were told was wrong they don't try to learn more or investigate to see if it was truth.<br>  <br>  So in all honesty I have never heard a a strong christian say these things about Catholics, and if they do its because they're idiots or have been misguided.<br>  <br>  And I'm not trying to bash you or prove your statement wrong because your Catholic. My very best friend is Catholic and I completely respect his practices and beliefs. I am just trying to show you that some of the "accusations" (accusations sounds bad) i mean like. The things you say you have heard from Protestants against Catholics, I think, have either been consumed by the world, or they just have the mindset of "they practice something that I don't, therefore they must be wrong" and they haven't Fully understood what being a Christian is about.<br>  <br>  Wow this ended up being very long LOL.<br>  I hope you didnt take this in an accusatory manner.

He then went on to say that every man should be fully persuaded in his OWN mind, not trying to convince someone ELSE'S mind.<br>  <br>  But those that insist on keeping the sabbath are trying to get a pat on the back, so to speak.  They're trying to build up their ego by saying that they can earn their way to heaven by keeping the Law, and that God owes them, not realizing that "We are saved by grace through faith.  It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast."

You need to go back and re-read your Bible before you start passing judgments.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Too bad you can't read. Mary had taken a vow of virginity and Joseph was a protector.

G-d did not have sex with Mary. She gave her permission to be the bearer of the Messiah. And she was spiritually impregnated.She trusted G-d. G-d knew that Joseph loved Mary and would protect her. Even before G-d explained to Joseph what was happening through dreams , Joseph was trying to help Mary stay safe.|`|uFAoq4idaa	This is to show to the world that Joseph and Mary were obedient children of His and that they were worthy to be called His faithful servants. God chooses and used imperfect people to be perfected in Him. This is not fornication or adultery because Mary and Joseph had not been living together. It was a hard thing for Mary to obey God because when she would be found guilty of having a child without a husband she would be stoned to death. Yet she obeyed God because she had been founded on the Scriptures. She fully knew that the prophecies of Isaiah and other prophets about the Messiah would be fulfilled. Sh had rejoice so much instead of being afraid when she was told by the angel Gabriel that she would be a mother to the Messiah. And Joseph had known this too and what a great privilege to be a father to the Great Messiah. God worked miracles in the lives of imperfect people because this is His purpose of sending His Son Jesus into the world. Abraham lied many times. Moses was a murderer and made so many alibis. David was an adulterer and a murderer. Solomon was an adulterer. Jacob was a deceiver. But they were forgiven by God and used them as an example to us. So that sinners might not be afraid to go to Him. God is a forgiving God. He calls for sinners and even the worst to come to Him through His Son Jesus.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	Common sense says that this sky fairy was not the father.  Joseph and Mary did the Vertical dance before they were married.

Jesus tells us that by accepting him as Lord and Saviour, then we are assured a place in his Father's Kingdom. It is by Jesus' grace and our Faith that we are saved.<br>  <br>  If you need proof in the direct sense, then I submit the thief on the cross next to Jesus when he asked him to remember him when he enter his Kingdom. Jesus replied by saying, Surly I tell you this, that this day you will be with me in Paradise.<br>  <br>  Jesus also told us those that deny him in front of man; he will deny them in front of his Father.<br>  <br>  Yes, Jesus did say the last to be chosen are the first he will call. That means for us that those who are pushed aside by others, Christ will look to bring them the best but also he wants us to understand that we are all equal in God’s Kingdom. Yet, we are commanded to take care of those who are less fortunate than others. It also means that those who have been pushed aside, God could choose them to do his great works and deeds. An example would be Moses, a man that was not a great speaker but was a leader of a nation.

It is the time leading up to Good Friday, when we celebrate the crucifixion. The lack of the Alleluia (a variant spelling of Hallelujah), is just one of several changes during Lent. <br>  <br>  The holy water is taken out of the fonts. Some churches replace it with gravel or sand. This is representative of Christ's 40 days in the desert. The royal/mourning color of purple is draped over everything, and priests wear purple garments. <br>  <br>  Alleluia is a song of joy reflecting the joy of the resurrection. However, at this time, we are approaching the time of His crucifixion. While the most important day of the liturgical calendar, it is also a very sad time, so a joyful song like the alleluia is not appropriate. <br>  <br>  Don't worry. We will be joyful and again singing the Alleluia at the Easter Vigil!|`|ptIIkqq0aa	Because Lent is a time of mourning, and  the "Alleluia" is a song of joy.|`|AA12042448	Alleluia is too joyous for the somber mood of the Lenten season, as it is traditionally observed.

Wait eagerly for that time, and use the Lenten season to reflect of Jesus' great sacrifice and death for the atonement of our sins.  Easter should be a great big Alleluia Party!|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Because Lent is a time of penance and sacrifice that anticipates the joy of the Resurrection, but calls us in the mean time to forego many of the things that we might otherwise enjoy.<br>  <br>  You don't go running around singing "Praise the Lord" when you're wearing (virtual) sackcloth and ashes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/qa-on-ash-wednesday-from-james-akin/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/02/21/ash-wednesday-what-do-the-ashes-signify/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...</a>|`|hVVALFAPaa	Alleluia is a song of praise and happiness. <br>  <br>  Lent is a time of sorrow and repentance.<br>  <br>  Singing a 'happy' song during this time would not be appropriate.|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	I never heard of that.

AA11432517	You really don't need candles or incense for spells. First off, what was the incense supposed to lend to your spell work? Just "mood"? Elemental energy? Mood you can create in other ways. Elemental energy can come from any number of substitute items. If the incense is to invoke an Air element, try a feather to represent the same. The most important thing is to know why your spell included incense in the first place and whether it is an essential or non-essential ingredient. I'm guessing it is non-essential and a substitute is fine. Even a flame-less candle is OK. If you relax and don't sweat the small details of you spell, you'll find results come more easily. Remember, the worst that can happen is that NOTHING will happen. Good luck with your spells!|`|FmazIF6Maa	Yes, I've known people who are allergic to incense and I've known young teens (I'm raising Wiccan children, some have Wiccan friends) who were not allowed to burn incense on their altar.     It's not actually necessary. The scent acts as a mind-trigger in ritual, but like everything else on the altar, it is just one tool.     If you really want to have scents, try an herbal sachet on the altar (much less potent), a small amount of scented oils in a burner which is much more subtle, or dab some essential oils onto cotton balls set on the altar. You could also use scented candles or candles annointed with oil if they don't bother you.    If you would prefer to do without the scents, use a fan, a feather, a potted plant that represents air, or an unscented candle for air in the color you associate with air.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Switching to candles will make every spell or incantation 26.3% less effective|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Candles are fine.  Your spell will be much stronger if you stay healthy.    The main reason for using incense is to increase your awareness of the world around you.  It helps to put you more in tune with the energy of 4 quarters (earth, air, fire and water which correspond with North, East, South and West).    Incense represent Air.  A candle would represent both air and fire.|`|dFBccLExaa	Oh yeah, you can substitute incense for candles, or any other scented item. If you're using it to get you in the "mood" try a scented candle, if you're using it to represent air, use something like a feather, and lastly, if you use incense to cleanse the area, you can buy a "Liquid cleanser" that they make now- I've even seen it in Barnes & Noble, though it looks hokey, the concept is there. I don't have asthma, but I have very sensitive sinuses, and nothing ruins a ritual like poorly made incense, so I don't use it very often. I've never had a problem with it, and I doubt you'd have any issues either. Do what feels best for you, it's always the best way to go.|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	There are a few tricks I can think of; depending on your ritual and your own beliefs, pick which you think best:    A) Burn the incense, but burn it outside. This might be the route to take if you are of the "smoke carries the message to the spirits" school, since it wouldn't matter if you were actually around the incense just as long as it gets burnt.    B) Use an oil in a fragrance diffuser. If you are of the idea that the scent itself is where the power is held, this might be the route to take.    C) Blow powders. There is a tradition especially in Voodoo workings of blowing  herb powders (often mixed with talc) around a room or at people, instead of burning incense. This spreads the fragrance similarly. It's also possible to just use the powders to sprinkle in the room.|`|jLL7sDILaa	You can substitute anything you'd like in rituals unless you believe that every little detail matters. It's your Will and intent that mean the most.|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	I have asthma too, but incense doesn't affect it. I always burn incense. You should try an incense that isn't too strong, because it could make you cough a lot... and the smell is really strong. I'm not sure about substitutes though... Maybe your rituals wouldn't work if you didn't use incense. Maybe there is smell-less incense XD|`|dIOs9tALaa	Lol AL, If I didn't know any better I would of believed you.     You can leave out the incense entirely for any spell. The reason why we use incense in some of our spells is so that the plant(s) used can lend their energy towards your goal. Does that mean that a thousand pounds of incense will bring better results than an ounce? Not at all. The plant's spirit will fuse with the spell and it will lend it's energy. Kind of like drinking herbal waters. To infuse water with a plant, the plant doesnt even have to touch the water.     So what can you do? If you can do without it, then go for it. If you really want to use it then try doing the ritual outside if it's possible and you won't worry about soffocating.     If you are using loose incense then you can cover the candle in oil and then sprinkle a little of the incense on the candle, when this is not possile then just sprinkle a tiny amount of the incense on top of the candle as it burns. I do this when I want to keep it simple.     You can use candles too. Say for instance you make your own candles, you can then buy a huge selection of oils and make the same incense blend but blend it into the candle so its energies are well infused. much cleaner and smokeless.     The possibilities are many, its up to you to do what will help empower you and have better results for your working.     Blessed be,   Shadow Storm|`|QiTjCBoMaa	You can substitute incense for either oils which don't produce any smoke but still have the aroma and therefore still works. Or yes, you can substitute for candles (obviously appropriately coloured/scented).    You can also use the oil to anoint the candle if you wanted. There are ways round it and the ritual/spell is not affected.|`|6jM9aAAvaa	you are a witch?

Between them was a yawning gap (the phrase is sometimes left untranslated as a proper name: Ginnungagap), and in this gap a few pieces of ice met a few sparks of fire. The ice melted to form Eiter, which formed the bodies of the hermaphrodite giant Ymir and the cow Aueumbla, whose milk fed Ymir. Aueumbla fed by licking the rime ice, and slowly she uncovered a man's hair. After a day, she had uncovered his face. After another day, she had uncovered him completely: Búri.<br>  <br>  Ymir fathered Thrudgelmir, as well as two humans, one man and one woman. Búri fathered Borr. Borr had three sons, Vili, Ve, and Odin, who killed the giant Ymir. In the vast flood of Ymir's blood, Trúegelmir was also drowned, although not before he had fathered Bergelmir. Bergelmir and his wife hid in a hollow tree trunk and survived. Odin and his brothers used Ymir's body to create the universe : they ground his flesh into dirt, and the maggots that appeared in his flesh became the dwarves that live under the earth. His bones became the mountains, and Odin strew his brains into the sky to create the clouds. The universe comprises nine worlds, of which this earth (Midgard) is central.<br>  <br>  They placed four dwarves: Noreri (North), Sueri (South), Austri (East), and Vestri (West) to hold up Ymir's skull and create the heavens. Then using sparks from Muspelheim, the gods created the sun, moon and stars. As Odin and two others (differing between the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda) walked along the beach, they found two pieces of driftwood. From these, they created the first human beings: Ask and Embla. Ymir's eyebrows were used to create a place where the human race could live in; a place called Midgard.<br>  <br>  The gods regulated the passage of the days and nights, as well as the seasons. Sól is the personified sun, a daughter of Mundilfari, and wife of Glen. Every day, she rides through the sky on her chariot, pulled by two horses named árvakr and Alsvier. Sól is chased during the day by Sk?ll, a wolf that wants to devour her. It is foretold that Sk?ll will eventually catch Sol and eat her during Ragnar?k; however, she will first give birth to a daughter as fair as she. Sól's brother Máni, the personified moon, is chased by Hati Hróevitnisson, another wolf. The earth is protected from the full heat of the sun by the shield Svalinn, which is placed before Sól.|`|AA11282654	Light is getting tired.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	I was wondering why my light saber was so...limp.

It is not open to all. This is socially divisive, critics argue. Human communities should instead be completely inclusive, open to all on the basis of our common humanity. Proponents of this view point out that many urban neighborhoods contain residents of different races and religious beliefs who nonetheless live and work together as a community. All that is required for such community life is that each person respects the privacy and rights of others and works for equal access to education, jobs, and political decision-making for all. Common moral beliefs are not necessary, it is said, in a liberal democracy. Unfortunately, the view just expressed is a vast oversimplification. Liberal democracy is based on an extensive list of assumptions, a preference of individual to community rights, a division between private and public morality, and the sanctity of personal choice. All of these beliefs are foreign to many other cultures. A liberal democracy is based than, as is every community, on a shared set of very particular beliefs Western society is based on shared commitments to reason, rights, and justice, even though there is no universally recognized definition of any of these. Every account  of justice and reason is embedded in a set of some particular beliefs about the meaning of human life that is not shared with everyone. The idea of a totally inclusive community, or religion, is, therefore, an illusion. Every human community holds in common some beliefs that necessarily create boundaries, including some people and excluding others from its circle. Consider an illustration. Imagine that one of the board members of the local Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Community Center announces, "I've had a religious experience and I now believe homosexuality is a sin." As the weeks go by, he persist in making that assertion. Imagine that a board member of the Alliance Against Same-Sex Marriage announces, "I discovered that my son is gay and I think he has the right to marry his partner." No matter how personally gracious and flexible the members of each group are, the day will come when each group will have to say, "You must step off the board because you don't share a common commitment with us." The first of these communities has the reputation for being inclusive and the second for being exclusive, but, in practice, both of them operate in almost the very same way. Each is based on common beliefs that acts as boundaries, including some and excluding others. Neither community is being narrow, they are just being communities. Any religion that did not hold its members accountable for specific beliefs and practices would have no corporate identity and would not really be a community at all. We cannot consider a group exclusive simply because it has standards for its members. Is there than no way to judge whether a community is open and caring rather than narrow a and oppressive? Yes, there is. Here is a far better set of test: Which community has beliefs that lead its members to treat persons in other communities with love and respect, to serve them and meet their needs? Which community's beliefs lead it to demonize and attack those who violate their boundaries rather than treating them with kindness, humility, and winsomeness? We should criticize Christians when they are condemning and ungracious to unbelievers. But we should not criticize churches when they maintain standards for membership in accord with there beliefs. Every religion, or community, must do the same.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Not at all.

Living a good life and praising God is more important than what faith you are. In short all religions are different roads to the same inevitable truth. Sikhs just believe theirs is the best way.

It's not like it will happen again, she can always break up with him now (that would be in her best interest). If she takes him back and he opens another can of whoop *** on her again then it's her fault. Obviously no woman deserves to get beat up that bad, but i don't condone exaggeration for celebrities. Go to the aid of your neighbours who you also don't know personally who are being beaten by their husbands then you have a case to be upset for Rihanna. But to single her out because she is a celeb i find inconsiderate. Chris Brown suprised everyone but Rihanna shouldn't be going out with someone who's gonna give her regular beat downs.
jiMAtaCraa	According to one book I read, called Wealth of Nations, written by Adam Smith (and the best book I've ever read), poorer individuals have more children because they see their children as "economic assets" - assets that will care for them in old age. Furthermore, due to the natural 'hazards' inherent in poverty, it is crucial that one has multiple children, as there is a higher likelihood of children dying (forcing individuals to have more children to offset this fact) as opposed to having less. In the more modernized nations of the world, individual needs come before rearing children (hence why Western nations have less children) as there are more opportunities open and do not feel the necessity to have children to take care of them in old age when they can do much of that on their own.<br>  <br>  Is it wrong? It is debatable, but it is simply the natural result of poverty. If you hate it - eliminate poverty.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Have to do with their culture, environment and the necessity.<br>  <br>  Culture of the emerging nation or the so called third world practice procreation, they have no idea about population control on family planning, least to say heard, seen nor knew anything about condoms and birth control pills.<br>  <br>  Environment, since these poor nation does not have running water or electricity, by night fall everything turns dark, no lights, what else you can do when there are no lights, no radio and no TV? procreate.<br>  <br>  Necessity, as these poor nation are still in the agrarian state, no small medium industry, no capitalistic business, family tend to have lots of child to help till the farms in order to survive, as each generation become binded into the agrarian business, they will continue to have more children to help on the farms.<br>  <br>  Of course, without proper farming knowledge and technology, soil erosion and over cropping result into poor soil management, and less productive are their field, and the poorer they get.|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Well -- there are people right here in the US who have a hard time feeding their families. In case you haven't noticed, there are a TON of people out of work.... it's human to have children -- you can't force people not to -- sometimes they need the children to work the land and help them survive.... so you can't just go dumping birth control on OTHER people and force them not to give birth. Besides -- many do have birth control, so just because they had a couple kids, it doesn't mean they're just sitting around having 14 kids. If you're so concerned about the kids not being cared for -- maybe you should go over there and help -- do the world a favor -- rather than complain about it.|`|8auEgQf2aa	When your ancestors thousands of years ago lived in caves trying to survive all day why did they have children?|`|s1Rzm9tCaa	Same reason people spend a ton of money on their credit cards and can't pay them off. They are not responsible for their actions. They think about the short term but not the long term. We are all, in a way, the same. That is why people need education. They need advice. Unfortunately, in a lot of 3rd World Countries, people have so much worries that they do not put mind into these things and it becomes a cycle for generations and generations. I mean, of course people in developed countries go to school and get educated about birth control but people in other countries are forced to work and don't go to school so really, their primal instinct to get what is good for the short term dominates their reasoning for what is good for the long term.|`|pfke6Jieaa	in "3rd world countries" ppl embrace family. they dont believe in abortions because a child to them is like a blessing from god. no one gives their children up for adoption like here in the US. how do u know they cant take care of them? most families, including in mine, have 5 or more children. im in a family of only 3 children, i think ppl have different views about it because there they believe those kids can work and bring money to the family.<br>  <br>  its only the few poor families who cant take care of their kids.|`|ngLaQMmgaa	no what they need to give them is education . the reason why many women keep having children is because they are uneducated , ive heard that some women think that if they have many children then at least one of them is going to help her when she gets older .|`|l1ctIW7eaa	who's going to pay for this birth control?

With more kids its more mouths to feed, sure. But unlike alot of lazy-*** western kids who are pampered, most 3rd world kids do WORK. They're far more self sufficient and industrious at making ends meet than many westerners.<br>  <br>  Ex- 6 year old haitian kid picks a bushel of mangoes all day and makes a dollar. That aint much, but 50 cents of that will go to food and annother fifty goes to the family. Many hands means less work and with everyone workin together tings get done faster. <br>  <br>  This is why we send people overseas. You have 5 kids and send one to go foreign and he strikes his fortune and whatever he makes, he gives back. Then the next one comes up and so on and so forth. You make sure everyone eats.
FKxrJxbPaa	what are you talking about?<br>  <br>  the number of free clinics present in the united states is staggering, I walked past 4 of them this week alone. <br>  <br>  Aside from that, most of the aid provided by associations such as Medecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without borders) are rather rudimentary in comparison to the healthcare provided in developed countries, and what they generally do is voluntarily fill the massive void in healthcare services that exists in third world countries such as Uganda, Nicaragua, Haiti and India.<br>  <br>  You simply cannot compare the afflictions of the third world with those of the West no matter how hard you try. Even among the poorest Americans diseases such as Cholera, Typhoid Fever, and Malaria are unheardof. Every American baby, unless the parents decide NOT to, is vaccinated against most of the more deadly and easily transmittable diseases, whereas people in the third world die by the millions from diseases we havent seen in decades.<br>  <br>  Trust me...I've been abroad. The poorest, worst hospitals in the United States are fairly decent compared to the healthcare available in Africa. Yes, american healthcare needs reform but you're well off by comparison.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Those "million dollar surgeries" only happen once in a million, and you damn well know it. NO organisation has the funds or resources at their disposal to perform these procedures for EVERY disadvantaged child here or in Africa. For every one kid that gets that miracle surgery millions don't and thats reality.<br>  <br>  Aside from that theres MUCH more bureacratic red tape involved in performing these surgeries on American children. Issues of insurance, liability etc are much more relevant in dealing with Americans...Americans are MUCH more likely to turn around and sue the doctor than third world patients are so in many cases so many overzealous litigants have made it so that its financially not worth it and many people lose out because of the stupid selfishness of a few people who cant take an act of grace with dignity and gratitude.|`|3e3e62517150959968d9185882de85ebaa	My brother is a doctor.

6qsTmMQaaa	If you have complaints about the service, it's your right as a customer to ask the waiter or waitress to get the manager for you. When and if you talk to the manager of the restaurant, it's necessary to maintain your decorum, and remember this if you are ever in a situation like this. Don't shout at the manager angrily about your dissatisfaction with the service. You have a right to be pissed off, but if you shout and yell at the waiter, it's just making you look like a dummy. Also remember that it's usually not a problem with the waiters; it's usually a problem with the cooks in the kitchen, so don't shout and scorn the waiters. They're just trying to do their jobs.<br>  <br>  As far as what the waiter or waitress should do if you're dissatisfied, they should offer you something to hold you over, such as another soda or cocktail or whatever you're having for a drink. They should offer some more complimentary bread or chips, or whatever the restaurant has for a complimentary appetizer, if anything. They should be apologetic, and they should check with the kitchen to reassure you about your meals. They should do their jobs and cater to your needs. If you want something to drink to tide you over, then they should get you what you want to drink. Have them get the manager for you.<br>  <br>  If you are going to leave, offer to pay for anything you have already purchased, such as drinks or appetizers. You DO NOT need to pay for the food that you did not receive, though. Then, walk out of the restaurant, after you have talked to the manager, and after paying, unless they tell you not to, which does happen sometimes.<br>  <br>  A situation like this happened to me once before, but we certainly didn't wait an hour for the food to arrive. We waited forty-five minutes before we decided to leave. Before we did, though, the manager came to us, and, instead of asking what the problem was, he was asking for tips for the band who was pretty much playing in our ears. Then we left, and never came back. It's unfortunate, because that was a great restaurant.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	I would tell the waiter to speed it up because it has been over an hour. If they don't get the food there in 5 more minutes then I would just leave and never go back again and call the manager to complain.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Ask to see the owner and ask what the problem is.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Get up and walk out.|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	first of all I would never wait one hour after I orderd to get my food.  It needs to be there in less than 30 min because even 30 min is pushing it.  After 30 min I would go find a manager and find what the hold up was, did my order not get turned in, is the kitchen on fire what happend.  If they were not on their way out with my food by this point I would let them know I was not happy and that I am leaving (depending on the sit)  I would not pay for the drinks or the food since I didn't get the food.  as for how should a waiter or waitress act.  An apology would be nice but I don't complain to the waiter or waitress about thier service I go straight to the manager and regester a formal complaint because the waiter or waitress may not tell anyone that they got a complaint and then nothing would be done.  If the service was bad, and I have had that happen to me, I complain to the manager and let the manager take care of it.  Last time this happend I just wanted the manager to know about it and he would up giving me my meal for free and the whole management staff, as I was leaving, walked up to the waiter and were calling him to talk to him.|`|d9e9d3a2969f4661e295d7b587567511aa	you need to talk to the manager. it is his job to see that everybody in his restaurant gets good service, he needs to know if one of his servers is this incompetent. and he will try and compensate you for your bad experience.|`|3852ea6a87816cc1b0c099b36909031baa	i have been there many times.......did you order anything out of the usual?

The waiter was probably caught between YOUR frustrations and the irritations from the cooks when he went back there to nag them. In theory.<br>  <br>  A good waiter would have asked the manager to come over to your table without you having to ask, actually. Being sincerely apologetic is the bare  MINIMUM.<br>  <br>  Knowing my family and the fear they have about making a scene, we probably would have left w/o getting our food or talking to a manager, either.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	The manager would have been called over if it was my table.
E0CZ69FYaa	No a person just saved won't be perfect nor will a person who has been saved for 70 years. As a Christian I don't expect anyone to be perfect that is the whole point of repentance. Salvation is preceded and followed by repentance. New Christians should take some major steps to get on track such as joining a Bible believing church and getting baptized. When you say you are saved you life should be changing. You are not the person you were before you are now "dead to sin" and you are free to follow God thanks to Jesus' death on the cross. No one expects people to be perfect because it is impossible. Only Jesus Christ lived a perfect life on earth.|`|GC3qn1Aeaa	The Lord said, "Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.."<br>  <br>  The Book of James says that the test of perfection is control of the tongue.<br>  <br>  Yours in Christ, Nick|`|xo4iux9gaa	No;  but atheists seem to think Christians should become perfect|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Hmmm....... <br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 5:48<br>  Therefore be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.<br>  <br>  Does that mean we do not make mistakes (sin) - no - but we immediately address the mistake(sin) through humility.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	A new born Christian is very much like a baby.  They need to grow in their faith and learn what is expected of them.  Paul covered this in Scriptures.<br>  1 Peter 2:2–3 (NIV)<br>  2 Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, 3 now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. <br>  Hebrews 5:12–14 (NIV)<br>  12 In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about<br>  1 Corinthians 3:1–3 (NIV)<br>  3 Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly—mere infants in Christ. 2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. 3 You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you<br>  <br>  The analogy between a human baby and a spiritual baby breaks down when we realize how each baby matures. A human baby is fed by his parents and growth is natural. But a baby Christian will only grow as much as he purposefully reads and obeys and applies the Word to his life. Growth is up to him. There are Christians who have been saved many years, but spiritually they are still babies. They cannot understand the deeper truths of the Word of God.|`|yJSPecgoaa	While this may not apply to you personally, many Christians who consider themselves to be "saved" continually brag about it, and lord it over those of different faiths, openly looking down on them in the process.  <br>  <br>  Too many times I have read here, and on other websites, the hate-filled words of those who are filled with pride over being "saved."  I have seen them tell Catholics and Jews they will "burn in h-ll" for not believing as they believe.  As long as such people brag about being "superior" to others, they open themselves--however unwittingly--to being judged in accordance with their professed "superiority."<br>  <br>  This is one of the main reasons why Jesus taught NOT to judge others, lest you be judged yourselves.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	I expect that person to do whatever it takes to walk the walk not just talk the talk.<br>  <br>  I hold christians to a higher standard because of what they claim they believe in and because of how hard they try to convert other's to follow.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Maybe not perfect but their should be a difference between a Christian and one that is not, even Jesus said we are to be different.

KiN3KVihaa	In writing Japanese kanji it will help you (and some people really struggle with remembering them while learning Japanese).  There is also a very small number of Japanese words where tonal change actually gives the word a different meaning, so learning Chinese might actually help you in recognizing this in Japanese (a lot of Japanese learners struggle with this too).  An extremely small number of Chinese characters and Japanese kanji have somewhat similar pronunciation sometimes too.<br>  <br>  But when people say that knowing other languages gives you an advantage in learning new ones...that is not the case all of the time.  For example, I was born in Japan to Americans, and thus grew up bilingual.  I was in America for high school though and had to take Spanish, and the only way my knowledge of Japanese helped me at all in learning Spanish was that I understood that word order is different in all languages and that things can never be translated exactly.  (Some kids in my class couldn't get over this for quite some time.)  I was also better at pronouncing Spanish too for the most part.<br>  <br>  Now I'm in university, and started taking Russian, and once again, my knowledge of Japanese has not helped me.  But my Spanish knowledge has helped a great deal in dealing with genders and the 6 different verb conjugations that are common to both Russian and Spanish.  And this is because Spanish and Russian are actually distantly related.<br>  <br>  But as it has been said, Japanese is a language isolate, so don't expect it to help you too much for speaking.<br>  <br>  I am actually going to China this summer to study Chinese though so I'll let you know when I get back. ;)|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Yes and no; Chinese and Japanese are NOT related languages (for anyone who thinks they are which drives me nuts -_-). Japanese is a language isolate (or distantly related to Korean, but mostly isolate). It uses the Chinese writing system but it's read in a different way, to fit the Japanese language. Japanese also uses two other writing systems. Also, the meaning of characters between Chinese and Japanese changes. The same character can mean two totally different things in Chinese and Japanese, and Japanese has some characters Chinese doesn't use (and vice versa).<br>  <br>  <br>  Japanese kanji (characters) have two types of readings: Onyomi which are "Chinese" and Kunyomi which are native Japanese readings/words assigned to the kanji. Many onyomi are nothing like the Chinese reading of the character<br>  <br>  For instance: 人 Person<br>  <br>  Japanese kunyomi: Hito, -to, -ri<br>                  Onyomi: Jin, Nin<br>  <br>  Chinese reading of 人: Ren<br>  <br>  As you can see the onyomi, which are "chinese" sound actually nothing like their Chinese readings. Some do however, like　父. The Onyomi in JApanese is Fu, and the Chinese reading is Fu. However, when the onyomi is used in a sentence or word, it would sound nothing like Chinese.|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji<br>  at:<br>  <a href="http://www.japaneseclass.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.japaneseclass.jp/</a><br>  the system of the site makes it more effective to learn Japanese vocabularies and Kanji<br>  <br>  its fun!<br>  just like playing game, earn EXP, gain level, and get Ranked<br>  its good for practice, and keep your motivation up<br>  and its free!|`|a6JZjRG1aa	no, it won't help you...<br>  Chinese is Chinese while Japanese is Japanese, two totally different languages...<br>  learning Kanji from on-line web sites will help but the grammar structure and speech patterns aren't similar and you will only be confused...<br>  .|`|2a57KzZlaa	3.

There's another way to write in Japanese, though, that doesn't use the Chinese characters.  The languages are very different and the Chinese won't really help you learn Japanese. But it won't destroy it either.  I have learned about 8 European languages and my theory is that after you learn one language it helps you learn others for the simple fact that you open your mind to other ways of using language.  If you're not really interested in Chinese, take Italian.  If you are interested in Chinese, take it.

Although Shabbat (or its anglicized version, "Sabbath") is almost universally translated as "rest" or a "period of rest," a more literal translation would be "ceasing", with the implication of "ceasing from work."

Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yep, your right -- Saturday is the 7th day or the Shabbot :)
grwtwPbAaa	I have heard Atheists say this too Jim. but you know brother, we know who is in control and I totally agree that I feel better as I understand in my heart the trust I feel in god.  This trust is growing and growing.  I am so blessed to Have His LOve!  Hallelujah, as knowing this certainly is fulfilling me with renewed strength and enthusiasm!  <br>  <br>  God bless you! :)|`|FpeEJbhaaa	I can't speak for anyone other than myself, but I've never said that - That saying is actually one of my pet peeves.|`|O7SshRl6aa	So... the answer to everything is "goddidit"?  That certainly doesn't help cure cancer or help feed the hungry.  <br>  <br>  I've personally NEVER said "everything happens for a reason" because I think belief in god is a sign of mental illness.|`|fQkb26jWaa	As someone who understands that all finite things are possible, I realized long ago that it was a certainty that this moment would eventually be experienced.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	1) If it does, those reasons are covered by physics and psychology, not theology.<br>  2) Your use of the word "know" is unwarranted.|`|ID55hffpaa	No, life is better when we are in control of our own lives. If you can't live your life without God, whether he's real or not, you're pathetic.|`|LF4vun1maa	It is arguable whether it is better to be the victim of a malicious act than an accident.  Many people feel better I think if their misfortune has a purpose.  God or the Devil or some other supernatural power ******* with them is more comfortable than the truth, because it makes them feel like they're important enough to matter and there's still some control.  The idea that they could be destroyed utterly by an uncaring, unaware universe for no reason at all can be terrifying.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't matter if you find a devil actively plotting against less frightening than an unfathomable universe destroying you because you're really just dust.  A fantasy being comforting doesn't make it real.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Purpose is a human invention for understanding or working with cause and effect.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we can accurately determine cause and effect (light fire, feel warm, purpose of lighting fire is to feel warm).<br>  <br>  Sometimes we see purpose where it doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  "The purpose of stars is to..."<br>  <br>  "The purpose of the rain is..."<br>  <br>  We understand reality better when we understand that cause and effect, or purpose, is only useful/accurate in some cases.<br>  <br>  However, often we feel better when we make up a story of "purpose" in retrospect.  It can help us heal after trauma.  "Purpose" becomes a metaphor for "I have come to terms with the trauma."|`|DqtSdgtPaa	I can't speak for all atheists but I can speak for myself and personally I never say that. I hate that saying. It drives me crazy. I say that some times things happen that you cant control and when they happen you just have to do your best to get through it.|`|NWopkX4baa	I certainly never say that. Yes, you feel much better thinking that there's some sort of reason why everything happens. It takes the control and responsibility out of your hands.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	I'm not an Atheist, I'm a Deist/Pantheist and I don't say that. It's due to the laws of the universe and the laws of probabilities.|`|2rJwgk40aa	everything happens cause thats life.it doesnt have a purpose or a written set of rules.it just happens.|`|B5umOqz2aa	Everything happens because it's a big universe|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	Nope. Never say that. False comfort isnt comforting for me.|`|AA11104499	Life is better when we let GOD have the control in all areas of our life., I know this guy and I worked with him for a while and he is a non-theist.  He just does not believe in anything that is spirit wise, although be says people should be able to believe in what ever they want and not be judged, well that is true because GOD gives us a choice to have peace and life with him forever or stay with the non believers. Most non believers say that the Universe and the Natural order of things are just where and how they should be, except we are killing this world in which they live and want us to recycle , don't eat meat and save the Whales, Polar Bears, Dolphins and so on and so on. I believe that also but I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and he gave his life for my freedom and I should thank him for all things. I do that everyday.  I am peaceful in my heart and I Pray and hope there are others who will come to know him too. I pray for my friend the non-theist he is so dedicated to the Unitarian Cause, but it is really a place to get together and say how much you don't believe in anything, except man. How sad for them the will never know the Love of GOD and how wonderful it is.  May GOD bless you|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Life is so much better when I take responsibility for my life.|`|MQBKnbSFaa	I don't say that.

I am glad you are persevering to leave your obsession with the straight guy behind and move forward in your life.  There will come a day when you look back and reflect on this time in your life as a learning curve.  You have gotten some really great advice above from people telling you to join the LGBT groups at your college.  Even if your university does have one, which mine does not, that doesn't mean that you want to go join up and start branding yourself with a rainbow flag for the entire student body to see.<br>  <br>  I am going to piss some people off but they will get over it.  You need to be stereotypical to seek out gays in your school.  Go to the Liberal Arts departments and there you will find many homosexual men.  They will be the ones who are music, theatre, art, etc. majors.  Go sit in on a few classes (those class sizes tend to be huge) but if you feel uncomfortable, just ask the professor beforehand and tell him you are interested in a major change or some excuse like that.  Mind you, all of the men in these classes are not homosexual, but you can bet that more than half of them are.  <br>  <br>  Go to your school's work out gym.  You can guy watch and maybe some of them will give you a glance back.  You do better to find them in the late afternoons or evenings.  Besides, get on a treadmill or elliptical machine, you will get your heart rate up and be doing yourself an additional favor by getting in shape.<br>  <br>  Also, you can find people on Craigslist.  I think this is a poor place to meet someone but if you are looking for something physical, then this would be up your alley.  <br>  <br>  But remember, you are great and have something really special to offer guys.  You will meet them when you are supposed to meet them.  Surely your "gaydar" has picked up on a few in your engineering and calculus classes.  You will do just fine and meet some great people and form a new social network away from your straight friend so he won't monopolize your thoughts as much.|`|QJRK8yltaa	The easiest way would be to join your college's LGBT group (it should have one ... even my conservative university has one). Then you don't even have to worry about the orientation of people you see that you like! <br>  <br>  But if you don't see anyone you particularly feel any attraction towards, just make friends with people. They probably know some gay guys that are single and don't attend the LGBT meetings. And don't give up on going to the meetings - there are always different people popping in and out of them. That's how I met my new crush :p|`|9gq7wAHBaa	clubbbbbbbbbbbs.<br>  you probably have friends that know people, maybe.<br>  myspace is ok sometimes, too.
a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	It's cheaper.  Most of the smokers that I know smoke about a carton a week.<br>  <br>  In my area, a carton of cigarettes is about $42.  After Obama's cigarette tax starts, it will be $48 (.60 cents per pack for the SCHIP bill).<br>  <br>  To roll your own filtered cigarettes, it costs about $11 a carton and they tell me it takes about a half hour to roll a carton.  Filter-less cigarettes are even cheaper.  Obama's tax will not effect the tobacco products used to roll your own.<br>  <br>  I guess they value that $37 a week savings.<br>  <br>  The tobacco shops around here are selling out of rolling machines because many people are switching because they don't want to pay more for their smokes.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:<br>  I talked to a friend of mine who works in a tobacco shop.  She told me yesterday that the SCHIP tax is on all tobacco products--even rolling papers.  The taxes on products like snuff, cigars and chewing tobacco are going to be about 100% or more.  Instead of costing $11 to roll your own it will be $25.  The tax on the rolling papers will be around 300%.  It's still much cheaper than ready-made but the taxes are outrageous.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	It is much cheaper than buying packs of cigarettes.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	It's the cheapest way to smoke cigarettes.|`|s6GKHKccaa	It's much cheaper to buy roll up cigs. Why not get a cheaper price for longer lasting product?|`|AGl4ifkLaa	One word..NO MONEY>>>>well thats two in one..get me!
5zs6eaOEaa	Bi means likes guys and girls. The whole point of the word is "I'll date guys or girls." It would be stupid to say you can't date a bi girl.|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Yes, my friend is daitng a striaght|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Ok, you can't turn her straight... but if she's bi there's no reason that your relationship whont work!<br>  <br>  If she's into you, then I don't see a problem :)|`|7PGxqRfZaa	I don't see why not. As long as she does not cheat on him with another guy or girl. If she is open about it from the start. Some guys like to date Bi women. You can't turn anyone straight. They are who they are. you,nor anyone can change that. If she is a good friend to you. you should be a good friend right back. Good luck.|`|FL67UPPHaa	Of course! My boyfriend is straight and we've been together for a couple of years now :)<br>  <br>  You can't change her orientation, but you don't need to! Bisexuals are attracted to men and women... even if she prefers girls, she can still fall for guys.<br>  <br>  Being bi doesn't mean she won't be faithful, or that she'll leave you for another girl. We don't need to be with both genders at once, we can be happy with one person.<br>  <br>  If you like her, ask her out and see how it goes :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Vu726Q18aa	yes i date straight guys although i want to date a bi one sometime but anyway yes what ever floats their boat|`|sVkBdQ28aa	Firstly, no one can 'turn'. That's not how sexuality works. You are what you are. If you could change it, I would be straight and not get all the abuse I get. Unfortunately I don't have a choice.<br>  <br>  If she's leaning towards girls, you may have problems in the future because she may be interested, but there's nothing saying she'll be unfaithful now or in the next few years or so. She may be faithful forever. I have a bi mate who's been dating a chick for two years now. Never wondered.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	Let's make it clear : YOU CANNOT MAKE HER STRAIGHT.<br>  <br>  Now, she's bi, so why would you want her straight ? She actually does like boys, even if she's got a thing for girls... If she likes you, which is possible 'cause she's bi, then go for it ;)<br>  <br>  You can totally date a bisexual girl !|`|EfIXhZdqaa	You can't "turn someone straight" any more than you can "turn someone gay." If she's bi, she's bi. Get used to it.<br>  <br>  Even tho she's leaning towards girls doesn't mean she won't like you. I lean towards guys and I still have a girlfriend.|`|52VDjbNTaa	Only if you both like each other.<br>  You can't turn her straight though and you have to respect that.|`|8tYaHBEKaa	yes you can. there is no barrier stopping you because she is bi|`|le29yexraa	I lean towards girls and I have a boyfriend. Can't turn her straight though, doesn't work that way.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	That sounds like twice the amount of possible STD's...|`|1dd3668b0491a4275cb04c48eb40d51daa	if she likes u thn yea you could good luck!~1~|`|zYKfX4q1aa	Of course you can go for her. You have just as good a chance as anyone else, maybe even more of one since you guys are good friends already.<br>  And since she's bi, you can't "turn her straight". Even if she's leaning towards girls she can still have feelings for you.<br>  Don't try to "turn" her, liking her for the way she is will give you a better chance with her.|`|b3e912316e2adfdbe8cb9632141ac6e2aa	dude, dude,dude... you cannot turn anyone straight or gay, it is the individuals choice...Yes you can date a bi-girl...<br>  Experience here, you loose them when you try to turn them.<br>  Take her on a date, enjoy...|`|eoCRWlrvaa	If she's still into you then yes.

God is perfect in all His ways. When God created humans they were perfect. But what happened? Mankind fell when Adam and Eve disobeyed God. Because Adam is our federal head we are all sinners born with the same sinful nature. God could have choosen to create man without the capacity to choose evil. But He didn't. Because God choose to make man with the ability to choose good or evil does not make God guilty, unholy or imperfect. If i have a child and she does a bad thing, am I a bad parent for getting pregant in the first place knowing my child will do bad things? The blame wholy rests on man and his guilty choices. Be thankful to God for His grace that He allows us to live and gives us breath sunshine, food etc all along why we spit in His face. God has the right to take us all out but He is gracious and long suffering. Take time to tell God you are sorry today and that you come to terms with your own guilt and unthankfulness.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	God could not make us any other way. We had to be made according to His image. We had to have the ability to feel temptation and to be able to think for ourselves. God knew we would be defeated by temptation and planned salvation from the beginning. It was no mistake. God offers eternal life.|`|AA11143689	After God made Adam and Eve, he said this was excellent, or very good, as contrasted to esteeming all his other creation as "good," so man was the highest epitomy of God's creative works.  (Gen 1 & 2)  However, in Gen. 6, as a direct result of Adam's sin= Adam's messing up -- which is Adams (mankind's) "huge mistake" mankind was no longer kind, or to take the pun further humans were no longer reflecting God's image or His Kind of Person, like God intended and created man to fulfill.  He was grieved and disgraced by all the evil abounding on earth.  No person who has ever lived is a mistake, we make mistakes and sin.  You are no mistake.  God has a purpose through it all to bring us to an understanding of God's design.  God knew we would sin, yes, but He also provided the way to Him in spite of sin, that is through sending His Son, Jesus, to pay the penalty for our sin.<br>  "He who knew no sin, became sin, so we might become the righteousness of God through Him."<br>  We are the apple of His eye.  We delight God when we are rightly connected to Him and have the Spirit of pleasing Him.  He loves us with all His might -- "Behold I stand at the door and knock - if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and sup with him and he with me."  Revelation 3:20|`|FWPSzFVhaa	God is not separate from Creation.  All that is - is only within God.<br>  Can one remove the artist from the artwork?|`|AA10096992	Good point. God makes a flawed product, and then blames the product for the flaws.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	He wasn't pleased with the choices they voluntarily made on their own.|`|36B3vmyDaa	He has never mentioned anything to me about it|`|AA10624860	I guess if your grandson made a mistake, that means you made a mistake?<br>  <br>  good logic...|`|N39N8PU9aa	If god doesn't make mistakes, then how can humans be flawed or satan exist|`|XeiNdIO8aa	God gave us free will and He knew we would sin and that's why He sent His only son Jesus to be our Savior. You call that a mistake?|`|xo4iux9gaa	humans are allowed to make their own mistakes...its called sin...|`|89MKzLl3aa	What makes you think He's not pleased? Just because of evolution, it's quite dismissive to say that He disapproves of His own Creation. This is simply your opinion regardless of what is true.
l2FOLWvnaa	Yep, you guessed it.<br>  <br>  Written by MEN many centuries ago, the Bible predictably fails to address modern problems not conceivable at that time.<br>  <br>  Even if a supernatural being did influence them (psychotropics don't count as supernatural) and showed them the modern world and its problems, they likely had no idea what to write about that. Such a supernatural being, knowing better, would either not have shown the modern world at all or would have said:<br>  <br>  "Don't write about this stuff, you want to be taken seriously right now, and if you tell them about e-mail you'll only get laughs and worse."|`|md0FQSxBaa	1. He gives people the freedom to make choices and with those choices comes consequences. When we make a choice that affects other people, we give them the opportunity to react correctly or incorrectly to our decisions. Everything has a consequence and God allows us to deal with those consequences. He has given us the tools for a peaceful life, unfortunately not everyone follows those rules, which eventually leads from simple disagreements to war.<br>  <br>  2. He has given us a brain and expects us to use it. He knows everything and now it's our turn to learn, experience and grow and act for ourselves. He has not created little robots that he pre-programs with everything we would ever need to know. Instead, we get to enjoy the fulfillment of learning, growing and stretching ourselves through experience.|`|GzBSBxqXaa	Well first of all God himself didn't write the Bible. The writing in the Bible is information that was passed down from God to diffrent people in the forms of dreams, messages and sightings to be recorded so some stuff could have been left out. And back when the Bible was written showers werent an everyday thing for people like they are now. They were a probably once a few years thing. And the thing about drugs. Drugs wernt used for just getting "high" like they are now. Many people didn't even know that the people back then didnt even use poppie plants, hemp plants or the cocoa plants like that. they were just plants|`|mgsISRWeaa	eight questions will be answered, in order"<br>  <br>  NO<br>  <br>  NO<br>  <br>  NO<br>  <br>  NO<br>  <br>  NO<br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  His "word" says "O how long will you simple people love your simple ways" <br>  <br>  God directed the hand of every author of that Bible. If he were to direct them in a path that had not been discovered by their own free-will (such as mentioning computers and e mail) then man would be even more confused than he is today.|`|pbsasBZJaa	God did simplify just as you asked. If he mentioned each one of these things and the many more, the world would be full of these books. Instead, God in His wisdom, decided to simplify for us and give us values and teach us principle.

He expects us to use them wisely.|`|AA11849917	These aren't answered in the Bible; but it DOES show how even a fool can escape hell.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah - it also talks about mockers like you in the last days!|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Bible was based on what people knew at the time, and how they felt at the time.  There are warnings about alcohol, but not drugs.  There are rules about keeping your house clean!  There's quite a bit about war, but based on the perspective they had in those days that THEIR wars were justified 'cos God was on their side.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Good question, but the Bible was intended to give us info on what we cannot discover.  Namely, things about God and the spirit realm He inhabits and why we are here.  It is not a science book or history book or a cook book, nor does it deal with the things that we can extrapolate on our own.  Thanks for asking.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Why do you think the Bible should be a complete guide to living, or a complete encyclopedia?  It was never meant to be that.  You have to figure out for yourself how to tie your shoes or how to ride a bicycle.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Thats weird.

Since God is all-knowing, wouldn't he know to simplify his "word" for the simple people he created?"<br>  because the "simple people" would not understand any of it.|`|NLinPsyhaa	It does. The Bible states that the body is the temple of the Lord 1 Corinthians 6:15 and 6:19. Keeping a clean house also helps with hygiene. <br>   War happens because of the greed and anger of men.

Then to love others as Christ loves the church.|`|e7304a95864d064998cb6153f4d52b91aa	Why?

qRx3ynKdaa	“Graal” is a medieval French word meaning some sort of platter. It does not appears in medieval French very often, except when talking about the “Sainte Graal", which appears in Middle English translation as the “Holy Grail".<br>  <br>  See <a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/helindanus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celt...</a> .<br>  <br>  For an example of “graal” just meaning a normal platter, search for “grail” (which is the form used by the English translator) in <a href="http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/lys01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celt...</a> which tells the tale of Gawain and the Lady of Lys.<br>  <br>  The “Holy Graal” first appears in Chrétien de Troyes’ “Perceval” as an object in a mysterious procession seen by Perceval in a castle. Chrétien describes it as made of gold and bearing many jewels and glowing. It is carried by a damsel and three times is carried in an out of a particular chamber, while those in the main hall are being served their food. It is followed by a lance from the head of which blood magically drips, carried by a squire. In a later passage a hermit explains to Perceval that the graal did not contain pike, lamprey, or salmon (apparently what one might expect a graal to contain), but contained a mass wafer which has alone sustained the life of a King who has lived within the chamber for 15 years, and that the King has lived on nothing else.<br>  <br>  Chrétien presumably would have explained more, but his work is incomplete. It is generally believed that he died before completing it.<br>  <br>  In a Welsh adaptation of this work known as the “Peredur” the word “graal” is translated as “discyl” which can be translated into English as “platter” or “salver”. See <a href="http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/peredur.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/per...</a> and search for “salver”.<br>  <br>  It would seem that the word “graal” was somewhat obscure at the time. It is not surprising that knights and clerks might not be expert in the technical name of a type of tableware. Accordingly in Wolfram von Eschanbach’s “Parzival” the graal is said to be a single precious stone called “lapis exilis', brought down by the heavens by fallen angels in pre-Chrstian days, though its mysteries can only be understood by a Christian. Indeed, a pagan knight named Feirefis in this romance cannot even see the graal until he is Christened.<br>  <br>  Later French romances explain that the grail is the vessel in which Christ performed his sacrament at his last supper, and was later used to catch his blood as he was brought down from the cross.<br>  <br>  Some texts explicitly make this vessel to be a dish. See Malory's “Le Morte d’Arthur” where Jesus tells Galahad what the grail is. “This is,” said he, the holy dish wherein I ate the lamb on Sher-Thursday.” See <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mart/mart426.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mart/mar...</a> .<br>  <br>  Other texts turn the graal into a cup or chalice, presumably because the writers did not understand the meaning of the word. In the mass, wine in a chalice was a familiar feature, and holy relics were often preserved in chalice-shaped containers. Accordingly in illustrations the graal was often shown as a chalice regardless of what the text actually said.<br>  <br>  In the “Perlesvaus” it is said that a chalice was sometimes to be seen within the graal, even when there was none, and that a chalice was the last of the five forms which the graal assumed, the other forms which are not allowed to be revealed. See <a href="http://omacl.org/Graal/branch6.html" rel="nofollow">http://omacl.org/Graal/branch6.html</a> . title XIX and see <a href="http://omacl.org/Graal/branch22.html" rel="nofollow">http://omacl.org/Graal/branch22.html</a> , title III/ .<br>  <br>  As to Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of the last supper, first of all, this painting was made centuries after people had stopped writing grail stories. Second, since the Bible mentions the cup, it would be strange for such a painting not to include it. Third, Jesus is pointing to the cup with his right hand. Look at the picture. It is a glass mug with the handle turned away from the viewer. There are other glass mugs on the table.<br>  <br>  In any case, the Holy Grail was not a mostly a cup at all in the medieval stories, but a platter of some kind.<br>  <br>  That the graal was originally a cauldron is a suggestion of some Arthurian scholars. Others think not. Others take that idea as just one possibility.|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	The Holy Grail is the cup that Jesus Christ drank out of at the final supper. The one where he said "drink this, for this is my blood" yadda yadda yadda. It is also rumored that the cup is the same cup that one of his disciples  used to catch Jesus's blood from the wound on his side when Jesus was being crucified. The Holy Grail was sought after King Arthur and the Knight's Templar because it was a hidden treasure. Those specifications, I'm not all too sure about either. <br>  Hoped that Helped :)|`|IRaIxWJKaa	LOL, the Last Supper painting was not made back when Jesus was alive.  It's done far later, they could put anything in it. Look at the background, that is NOT the buildings that would be around when Jesus was in the area he lived in.<br>  <br>  DaVinci painted that in the 15th century, 1500 years AFTER Jesus died. What's on the table is what he thought would be on the table, not what actually was.  Heck, they probably didn't even have tablecloths or sit all on one side, right?|`|5CLx01G1aa	The holy grail is what Jesus drank from at the Last Supper, it is considered to be sacred.|`|fcEKMw1Haa	The grail myth existed before the coming of christianity to the British Isles it was  called the cauldron of Cerridwen. A Celtic goddess associated with rebirth and renewal.  In the Arthurian romance which was codified by the priest of the early church it became a cup or chalice and was called  San Grael or sacred/ holy  blood.|`|AA11120148	In the BIble, there is mention of a cup at the last supper.

HHp1toNXaa	It looks like a post-Catholic now LDS site just trying to do their part to convert Catholics or other Christians. Sigh....<br>  <br>  About their conversion story they wrote:"The family impressed them with their Christ-like examples in serving one another and others in the area with love and generosity." <br>  <br>  What, they could not be "Christ-like examples" while being Catholic?? I think they traded down if you ask me ;-)|`|OLnmXeWDaa	I wonder how the LDS Public Relations folks feel about it. It doesn't appear to have any official connection to LDS, Inc.<br>  <br>  In the past decade, the LDS church has allowed FAIR and now MAD to flourish. Those sites can present arguments and positions that the official leaders don't want to say out loud. It gives the church a forum for floating new ideas without being accountable.<br>  <br>  Brigham Young and all his weird ramblings about blood atonement and Adam-is-God left them with a very cautious outlook on official pronouncements. They like official deniablility now.<br>  <br>  If this new website attracts any attention, the church will let it stand. If it embarrasses them in any way, off with its head.|`|PKWHLbdfaa	The website claims to want to build a bridge between Christian demonimations, then teaches doctrine that few Christian churches teach.  Then I notice the editor is a Mormon.  Give me a break.<br>  <br>  Deception!  Why not just come out and say, look I'm a Mormon, I view the world through Smith-colored glassed, here are some doctrines I think everyone ought to belief, have a nice day.  But why hide behind this Foundation as a front to promote Mormon theology?<br>  <br>  I guess the good news is anyone who's spent any time at all studying Biblical teachings on the trinity, Jesus, salvation by grace will see right through this in a NY minute.|`|AA11472314	I had never seen this site before.  Thank you for the heads-up.<br>  It appears that the couple is indeed LDS from a Catholic background, but appears to have no outside sponsorship.<br>  <br>  As far as the imagery, LDS do indeed have pictures of Jesus Christ on the cross taught in lessons:<br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/pa/display/0,17884,7745-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/pa/display/0,17884,77...</a><br>  And Family Home Evening:<br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/hf/art/display/1,16842,4218-1-2-73,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/hf/art/display/1,1684...</a><br>  <br>  I also found one of the most moving portraits of the lifeless body of Christ during this search:<br>  <a href="http://jesuschrist.lds.org/SonOfGod/eng/his-life-and-teachings/articles/the-atonement-of-jesus-christ" rel="nofollow">http://jesuschrist.lds.org/SonOfGod/eng/...</a><br>  <br>  A Google Image search on "LDS crucifixion" shows thousands of results.  LDS typically glory in the cross and Christ's death for us but don't take lightly imagery of the death of any great religious figure, especially the great I Am.  It's not something you lead with, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Also, LDS recognize that 3 manners of prayer exist in the Bible.  Folding the arms is cultural, but by no means the only way one can sit/stand before God to offer ourselves to Him.  My daughter often prays with her hands clasped in front of her, and I don't discourage it.<br>  <br>  I learned a lot from your question.  Thank you for asking it.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	yes, I went to the topic on satan and found a scripture from the Doctrine covenants:<br>  The Biography of Satan<br>  Satan (or the Devil—literally meaning slanderer), is a spirit son of God who was born in the morning of the premortal existence (D&C 76:25-26). Endowed with moral agency, Satan chose the evil part from the beginning, thus placing himself in eternal opposition to the divine will of God our Father. <br>  you can look for yourself.|`|rx20pKgOaa	While it doesn't look like your "typical" LDS based site they do have a neat conversion story.  And you can't say they are following "blind faith" as they are unusually well educated and studied in religious doctrine. <br>  <br>  Why are you curious about it?|`|AA10637643	It looks like a "Christian" website, meaning all religions that believe in Christ... notice on the left, "Catholic to LDS".  I don't think it's a website done by the LDS church, but it looks nice.|`|AA11824333	I wouldn't think Mormon at first. Something about it does have a cultish look.|`|8ioV3sE2aa	wow, it's totally an LDS website.<br>  All the concepts (marriage, afterlife etc) are LDS. <br>  And the sources and quotes are from LDS scriptures and prophets. <br>  <br>  how did you find this website?<br>  <br>  <br>  :)<br>  Live Laugh Love|`|8UqDCPjRaa	It is definitely LDS.  They are trying to use symbols like the dove, etc... to appear more Christian.  The fact that they don't come out and say they are LDS just shows how deceitful they are.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	No, I wouldn't have thought it was an LDS site straight-off.  But now that you mention it, the graphics look really LDS.  I've seen this artist's work somewhere before, maybe in the LDS museum in Salt Lake..|`|mU2eMSi3aa	Yes, a Mormon would immediately recognize some of the Mormon artwork like Jesus kneeling in the garden of gethsemane, talking with the children and coming out of the tomb.  Also several of the topics like pre-mortal life and catholic to lds.  Although Mormons don't focus on the cross or display it much they still believe Jesus died on the cross and do have pictures in their manuals of it.  It is obviously something that is familiar to Catholics and is what they call, "Building on common beliefs."  The same with the picture of praying with your hands together, even though it is not done in the Mormon church missionary flip-charts have a similar picture because it is a familiar theme for Christians that gives comfort of commonality.  <br>  <br>  This site is intentionally built to appeal to Catholics so that it can dispel fear long enough to build upon similar beliefs.  Having been a Mormon missionary myself I can tell you this is how all of the missionary discussions are structured; you first state beliefs that are common to Christianity to "Build a relationship of trust" and then you introduce a Mormon concept in a way that sounds like a natural progression of their own beliefs. For example; you begin talking about Old Testament prophets like Moses and how he was called in a certain time period to fulfill a certain purpose and how Noah was called in another time to fulfill a different purpose and so if God were to do something He would call a prophet for that purpose right?  They you talk about prophets for a while and build upon what they already believe about prophets and how Moses didn't build arks and Noah didn't reveal the 10 commandments but they each had their own separate but equal purposes in their own God appointed times.  Then you go right into how modern prophets would make so much sense and well did they know there actually was a prophet called in our day etc...  Next thing you know you're a wet behind the ears Mormon!|`|93r3nCM1aa	Kinda...I mean under the marriage subheading they talk about eternal marriage peformed in the temple, and reference the docterine and covenant. They also list the book of mormon, pearl of great price, and D&C under "scriptures". <br>  <br>  I've seen mormon artistic renditions of people praying with hands like that.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking maybe the banner was just kinda a generic Christian one or something.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	They're not being deceitful in any way.

rswiEosSaa	It's not a sin to drink under the age of 18. It's a man-made law. Far as I know, many man-made laws do not equate to God's laws (i.e. Jim Crow laws, etc). So NO, it's not a sin to drink under 18, if its ok with your parents and if you don't drink to get drunk. They used to serve wine in Catholic Churches, however, now it's mostly grape juice because of man's laws.|`|U81o09nHaa	Do what you want; just don't be an idiot and think you can drive.

It's a sin to be drunk.<br>  It's also a sin to do something which you believe to be a sin - so if you believe drinking is a sin, and drink, then you actually are committing a sin.|`|boqwvEvUaa	um, sin or not, everyone's still drinking ;)|`|SgKsHxD5aa	drinking isnt a sin(regardless of age) as long as your not hurting anyone|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Drinking is not a sin. Drunkenness is a sin. <br>  <br>  <br>  (I hate drunks. Guess that would be a sin)|`|Io9288c7aa	It is not a sin per se` to drink. But it is a sin to break the laws of the country that you are drinking in. (Or drink to excess and can't control your own actions & reactions.) So if you are of age to drink legally in Canada,  do so responsibly. If you are under the legal age to drink in America, don't drink alcohol, but a non alcoholic substitute instead. That way you will not only not sin, but also not break the law, which is the sin in this case.|`|xqU1N1VBaa	its not a sin in the bible to drink. <br>  <br>  its illegal to drink at 18 in some parts of Canada but not in Quebec.

Islam forbids the consumption of any alcohol at all, and I've known muslims who checked all their food to make sure there were no traces of alcohol in the ingredients.  I think among Christians, most feel that there's nothing wrong with drinking in itself, only in indulging to the point that you have a problem with addiction.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	We are to uphold the law of the land unless it conflicts with the laws of God.

Well, I think it's already retreating from its highwater mark. Free market capitalism is an atheist ideology and look where that's landed us right now.  Across the world, religions of all varieties are growing, and as long as America continues to be the cosmopolitan nation it has always prided itself on being, those religions will begin to take root in your country too.  Secularism has started to look like soullessness and a lot of us don't care too much for its bleak "life's a ***** and then you die" message.  A lot of American religion strikes me, an occasional visitor, as very immature; but I'm also aware of some very creative traditions of faith that look set to influence your culture for a long time to come - not least, the one that helps to make Obama the man he is.<br>  <br>  Atheism is maybe a stage that a culture has to go through, but will grow out of when its limitations become appparent.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Never.

78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	I'm against abortion, as I don't think you can say today/this minute/ this second it's not a life or a person and the next second/minute/day it is a life or a person. Where do you draw the line? <br>  <br>  But some friends of mine have just had an abortion.  It's really sad because it was a much wanted baby, and they think about it as a baby, but they were told it had next to no chance of surviving until birth and no chance of surviving the first year.  They decided it was better for both the baby (their words) and their other child (who would have suffered as well if the child was born only to die) if they ended the pregnancy.  I guess it's like switching off a life support machine when there's no hope of survival. I don't know that it's right, but under these extreme circumstances, I can't really say that it's wrong.  Particularly as I know how upset they are and how much they want and love the baby.<br>  <br>  I'm just glad it's not a decision I had to make.|`|VKXNWcbGaa	I am a Muslim that believes that abortions ar ok if they can save the life of the mother or any other lives.

It is  ok to abourt, but better for you if you didn't.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	Not a christian,i'm pro-choice for the fact its not my body so i see no right in telling woman what they should do with theirs...And also we don't know why she is getting it done,so people should not judge her for it...|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	if the mother's life is in danger.|`|knOdcrDkaa	Not a Christian, but fetuses are not persons, and therefore do not have rights.  Pregnant women are persons, and with personhood comes the right to refuse to use your body for the benefit of another.  "Being forced to use one's body for the benefit of another" is the definition of slavery.<br>  <br>  edit:  Saying that abortion is alright only in cases of rape and incest is another way of saying, "we view this fetus not as a person, but as a punishment."  They only allow women who are "innocent"(of sexual desire) to abort.  You can't claim to respect life or care about the potential baby and then use it to punish someone.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	If someone is raped and becomes pregnant, I support her right to have an abortion.

I never have thought that abortions should be used as a form of birth control, however, I cannot see myself telling a woman who is pregnant and has no job and six children already that she needs to have that baby because it would be wrong otherwise.  <br>  <br>  To me, it's about where you want to deal with the problem, either deal with the fact that a woman wants to have an abortion or deal with the fact that we have yet another unwanted, abused child who'll grow up and either rob my house or end up drawing from my paycheck just like her mother or in prison or dead or whatever other tragic scenario you can think of.  <br>  <br>  And for those who say that because the woman chose to have sex so she should bear the responsibility, I agree with you.  However, why is she the only one that has to endure this life altering process?  For the next twenty years, this woman's life as she knew it will be over.  Meanwhile the man who also had sex, can just galavant and tomcat all around town as long as he sends a check every month.

We are supposed to pass judgment on those who teach.<br>  <br>  The Bible warns us that some groups will not endure sound doctrine and will teach the doctrines of demons. Those groups need to be exposed.  One of my many jobs as a Pastor is to do that.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that the XYX denomination does or does not preach the Bible and those who follow that are or aren't Christians but I can't tell you if any person in that group is or isn't since they have learned information from another source which I would not know about.<br>  <br>  In Matthew chapter 7, Jesus tells us that not all who say, "Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom . . .

I was blocked once from someone I disagreed with, even though my disagreement was respectful.  That person just didn't have the personal wherewithal to be disagreed with.  That was a reflection on their poor character and no reflection on me.  Some people are so stuck in their ways they cannot bear to be disagreed with, and that is disrespectful to those who simply don't share their opinion.  That's not a reason to block someone.  Here on Y!A it's not rational to think others will always agree with you.  This is too public a format to expect such a thing.

wGQvgeXDaa	Hypothetically speaking there shouldnt be any problem as Islam is a brother religion of Judaism. I guess, what the parents can do is be good role models and encourage their children to be good and learn about their own beliefs and let them decide which path to take.<br>  <br>  My father was a Muslim and my mom was a Catholic. They never in any day dictated us to become either one of their religions but they did practice their own. We found a lot of problems with my mom's religion as compared to the simplicty and rationality of my dad's so everyone in the family later on became Muslims including my mother who inshallah died in a state of Islam.|`|UhyvM73iaa	Islam insists that child belongs to father and carries his name.<br>  However, mother has right in Islam to keep the children until age 12. After that children belongs to father in case  of divorce and court gives childen to father.  There are two reason. Because it is Shariah law and all Muslims believe in it, most mothers do not try to keep the children with her after age 12 knowing she will not get from the courts. <br>  <br>  1. If mother remarries to some other man, to him her daughter from previous marriage is nothing. Some second husbands molest such girls. Allah has made this rule for the protection of daughters that she must be given to father after she has her first periods.<br>  <br>  2. Boy also stays with mother until 10 or 12 years of age. Because mother can raise the children better than father at their young age with her capacity of love and care.'<br>  Secondly it will be very hard for mother if her small teachers are taken away from her. This will be cruelty to her.<br>  <br>  3. After age 12 boy needs to learn to be a man and therefore must be with his natural father to get education and/or  some trade to learn how to make his living and learn how to raise children from his father.<br>  <br>  Jewish people believe children belong to father if he is Jewish and belong to mother in case her husband is not Jewish.<br>  <br>  It is little too much wishful thinking.<br>  <br>  Muslim husband will also teach her children to worship one and only God. Which is the most important thing of both religions.  So there isn't whole lot of conflict in belief.  If she believes in all cases children belongs to her, then she should never marry a Non-Jewish man.  That will also save Muslim men from having trouble from the Jewish mother of his children.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	Every child is born on fitrah (natural state). What is natural for the human being is to worship their Lord and creator, Judaism as it stands today is more based on the dictates of the pharisees therefore it is more based on nurture rather than nature. As stated by another person the child takes on board the religion of their father irrespective of what any jew may say, should the wife take onboard the religion of her husband and become a practicing Muslimah then there should be no problems insha Allah, but in this day and age because of the intermarriage problems that such a union will cause between husband and wife of these different faiths, I'm afraid that I'll have to go with the opinion of mainwool here people. like it or not it's a fact. And if their is a couple of both respective faiths going down this road then they're only opening a can of worms for themselves later in life as the child will be forced to choose between which parent to side with.(However I can't argue against M15TRY me's point either) .|`|ORbFRn4oaa	One of the OBJECTIONABLE part of Judaism is that it goes by ancestory / progeny. They may have a conversion process, but to my best guess, a difference is always there.<br>  <br>  To me this seems to be more of a FABRICATION. Because God is the creator of ALL of us. And Righteousness and obedience to God is the ONLY criteria, HE has. <br>  <br>  In my view, let the child decide, which way he/she wants to go. Educate the child in both directions, and leave the decision to the child, rather than force it up his/her throat.<br>  <br>  Moreover, Islam does NOT consider Judaism as FALSE. It just considers it "Outdated". Islam is based on the FINAL scripture that God has sent. This scripture (Quran), relieves the Jewish people in particular and Christian people in general from:<br>  <br>  1-  from certain commandments that were inflicted as a result of their persistent rebellion.<br>  2-  gives new laws and rules that are applicable to the new society. The laws of the Torah were more particular towards the primitive societies.<br>  3-  relieves many dietary restrictions.<br>  4-  Relieves the Jewish people from the law of Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Thus in essence it is a mercy for them.<br>  <br>  IF the child wishes to go by the primitive rules of Judaism, then let her go by that. Because the present day Islam (Organized Islam) is not even a thousand miles near to what the Quran says.<br>  <br>  Also please do note an important point:<br>  <br>  1-  Islam is by CHOICE.<br>  2-  Judaism is perhaps NOT simply by choice. It goes by ancestory. <br>  <br>  A person can leave Judaism and join Islam ANYTIME. I don't know if the converse is true or not.|`|mqrABgEqaa	I like your question.

R76ema39aa	The child would most likely go for whichever religion he/she believes to be correct. <br>  The father would teach about Islam, and the mother would teach it about Judaism.<br>  Most likely, it would depend on who influenced him/her more as a child.<br>  Plus it would also depend on what the parents taught about each religion. One of the parents might not be very religious, whereas the other parent might be.

s1zitZMOaa	In an overall, general way - yes I do. <br>  <br>  One of my mottos in life is that life is not fair. So I believe that bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. Because they do. But overall, I do think things have a way of working out and the score is usually settled - not always, but usually. A guy who is a creep, treats his employees bad, doesn't pay them well, and takes every opportunity to screw his business partners may find his finances flourishing. This may seem unfair but he's also likely to find that after a while no one wants to do business with him or when he's old, dying in bed no one wants to come and visit him. In my eyes, that's justice. <br>  <br>  That's just one example but overall I think things usually even out in the end. I base this off my own personal experience.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Just because people don't believe in a deity doesn't mean that there is not a clear right and wrong.

OfeCeEvqaa	The scriptures boldly prophesy that catastrophic events will take place in the end of time. As we grow closer to the appointed time, the blurred images that prophecy preachers of the past construed from Bible passages have continued to sharpen in focus until it takes little imagination to picture such scenes around the world today. Add to this the present evidence that the other calamities outlined in Revelation have progressed to the imminent threat level, and you have a serious case for the rapture of the church.<br>  <br>  I believe that Jesus Christ will rapture His church at the appointed time in the future and  despite the frightening trends of our present world, I do not base my belief upon the status quo but upon clear statements from the Word of God. Readers who profess even a modicum of faith in the Bible need to know about the rapture of the church. We all need to understand that it could happen much, much sooner than we might imagine.<br>  <br>  Christ’s coming is twofold. First, He will come for the church. This is really the core of the Rapture doctrine. “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord” (I Thessalonians 4:16-17). Also, “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him” (II Thessalonians 2:1). Phase one of Christ’s coming, then, will not actually occur upon the earth, but rather above it. Phase two of Christ’s coming will happen when He comes with His church. “The LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee” (Zechariah 14:5). This will begin the thousand-year peaceful reign of Christ on the earth (Revelation 20:6). These are the two elements of the coming of Christ. They are coordinate actions, each one complementing the other.<br>  <br>  The rapture of the church holds great significance for believers. Paul referred to it as our “blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13). Jesus set it forth as a great incentive for Christian living. “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man” (Luke 21:34-36). Finally, the Scriptures tell us that the Rapture is a great comfort to the church. “Wherefore comfort one another with these words” (I Thessalonians 4:18).<br>  <br>  Immediately following our Lord’s ascension into heaven, two men (angels) gave this message to discouraged disciples: “Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up unto heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11). This message clearly describes a literal, physical event. It places deliberate emphasis upon the identical person (“same Jesus”), the identical method of return (“shall so come in like manner”), and the identical means of perception (“as ye have seen him go”). I Thessalonians 4:16-17 spells out the exact order of events in which the saved who have died, the saved who are still living, the archangel and Christ Himself shall participate in the Rapture. Revelation 1:7 tells us, “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him.” Without question, Christ will appear personally and visibly.<br>  <br>  The Rapture will signal a marvelous change in the material makeup of the bodies of the saints. Our bodies will undergo a transformation from mortal flesh to a new, glorified substance designed to inhabit heaven throughout eternity. “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed” (I Corinthians 15:51-52). The properties of this new body will apparently be like that of the resurrected body of Christ. He appeared and vanished at will and defied even the force of gravity. Such a change will enable the saints to be “gathered” to Christ. The transportation of our bodies will follow their transformation. In I Thessalonians 4:16-17, the phrase “in the air” signifies an actual journey from this earth to heaven. However it may occur, we shall appear with Christ in glory. “When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory” (Colossians 3:4). The Scriptures always refer to heaven as a place above, up, or beyond. In Revelation 21:2, John saw the New Jerusalem as a place separate from the earth,|`|94aceb82c6668e0fc341436367b2d246aa	No, no rapture, and nowhere will you find the word or concept in Scripture. Those who buy into this man-made doctrine may want to reason on the fact that God has never had to remove his people from the earth to protect them from any of his judgment actions. The Deluge, Egypt, Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of Jerusalem, etc.<br>  <br>  Matt. 24:21, 22: “Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” (This does not say that “the chosen ones” will all have been taken to heaven before the great tribulation, does it? Rather, it holds out the prospect to them, along with associates in the flesh, of surviving that great tribulation on earth.)<br>  <br>  Rev. 7:9, 10, 14, RS: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, ‘Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!’ . . . ‘These are they who have come out of the great tribulation.’” (To “come out” of something a person must go into it or be in it. So this great multitude must be persons who actually experience the great tribulation and come out of it as survivors.)<br>  <br>  That is just a portion of the evidence against the concept of 'rapture'. I think it shows a real problem with the doctrine.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	The book of revelations is about the events that happened approx. two thousand years ago.  Its over.  Move on.

I believe this "falling away" is the rapture. I believe this because if we read further down to verse 7 the "he" that is referred to is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit dwells in Christians, so when the Holy Spirit is taken away that means Christians will also be taken away.<br>  <br>  Edit 1: Matthew 24:29 refers to the Revelation 19 when Christ returns to the earth. When Christ comes to rapture the church, He will not come and set foot on the earth.<br>  <br>  Also, you CAN NOT connect the seventh trumpet of Rev. 10 with 1 Cor. 15:52 because the Revelation was not revealed to John until 40 years after Paul wrote to the Corinthians.<br>  <br>  As for Revelations 13:7, we know that there will be Tribulational saints because they are the ones who do not receive the mark of the beast in Revelation 20:4 "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."<br>  <br>  So to say that these saints has to refer to the church is not true.<br>  <br>  Suzette: the word "rapture" is a translation of the Latin word "rapturo" which is a translation of the Greek verb form "caught up" used in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.<br>  <br>  Kuve: "For all the saints and Elect of God are gathered, prior to the tribulation that is to come, and are taken to the Lord lest they see the confusion that is to overwhelm the world because of our sins."

I Corin. 15:52 <br>  <br>  Don't be deceived by the fictional  "Left Behind" series....which is based on a common misconception that claims the 'rapture' occurs years before Christ's Return.

If there was anything in scripture to suggest such a thing it seems like it would have been noticed by someone somewhere prior to that, and would have be accepted by Churches other than evangelical Christianity.  It didn't even get widespread acceptance among them until 1908.  It's possible to take isolated passages out of the Bible and use them to support anything at all from the Crusades to the Slave Trade to the Holocaust, the Rapture is no different.|`|AA11232725	It might, but I think that the Scriptures teach that the gathering of the Saints to the Lord Jesus will occur right before the final wrath of God is poured out on the hardened rebels at the end of the tribulation.<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:29  "Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.  30  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  31  And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  <br>  <br>  32  "Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.  33  So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near--at the doors!<br>  <br>  No one knows the day or the hour of our Lord's coming, but He told us that when we see these things happening His coming was near.<br>  <br>  Revelation 10:5-7  The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to heaven  6  and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be delay no longer,  7  but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.<br>  <br>  In the above passage is speaks about the 7th trumpet and in this passage is speaks about the "last" trumpet.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:51  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed  52  in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.|`|5vqo3XzHaa	I believe it will happen before the great tribulation.  There are many scriptural references to support my answer, these are just a few of them:  1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Thess. 5:9-11; Rev. 3:10; Rev. 4:1; Rev. 19:7-14.  When one compares the scripture in 1 Thess. 4:13-18 to the scripture in Matthew 24:29-30, the event described in 1 Thess. is a happy event for those who are "sleeping" (those who have died believing in the Lord Jesus Christ), and who are "alive" when the Lord returns.  Also, those sleeping and alive are "caught up" to meet  the Lord in the "air".  In Matthew 24:29 it says "Immediately AFTER the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be shaken."  Verse 30 - "And THEN shall appear the SIGN of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall ALL the tribes of the earth MOURN, and they shall SEE the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  This is not a happy event as is described in 1 Thess. 4, as all the peoples or nations are mourning at this event in Matthew 24.  This scripture is talking about when Christ comes back to judge the nations and begins His 1,000 year reign on earth.<br>  <br>  Rev. 19:7-8 - "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.  And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints"  When one reads just a few verses later in verse 14 - "And the armies which WERE in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.", it is very clear who these armies are - they are the "wife", or "bride" of Jesus Christ.  They are the ones who were "sleeping" and "alive" in 1 Thess. 4, when they were caught up to meet the Lord in the air, the Rapture.<br>  <br>  While the 7 year tribulation is happening on earth, all those who were "caught up" or "raptured" BEFORE the tribulation will appear at the judgment seat of Christ, where their works will be passed through the fire of His judgment (1 Cor. 3:14-15), and they will either be rewarded or suffer loss.  Then will come the marriage supper of the Lamb in Rev. 19.  And finally, we return TO earth FROM heaven with the Lord, and it never mentions us returning back to heaven or the "air" after that.  Furthermore, ALL of the 7 seals would have been opened by this time, ALL of the 7 trumpets have been blown by this time, and ALL of the 7 vials or bowls have been poured out on earth by this time.<br>  <br>  Finally, the word of God tells us that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, that's where His Spirit resides, in each believer when we are "born again" by His Spirit.  Now, if just one believer were left to go through half or all of the tribulation, then that would mean the Holy Spirit would be left to go through the tribulation too and suffer God's wrath, and that's just not possible.<br>  <br>  I could have gone into much more detail and given many more scriptures for why I KNOW that the Rapture happens BEFORE the tribulation, and not through it, or after it, so I pray that what I have written and the scriptures I have given will suffice.  God bless you!!!  :)|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	When Jesus was talking to John in the book of Revelation concerning the tribulation he said in Rev 1: "1The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place.

Jesus stated very clearly in Matt 24 when He was coming back.   When the sun and moon no longer give their light and all the stars of heaven fall, THEN, AT THAT TIME, He will return.   There's not a soul who can say that is not just before the world is destroyed.<br>  <br>  Matthew:<br>  <br>  29  "Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: <br>  <br>  30  And THEN shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, pre-trib.  There are a bunch of verses that point to this.  Revelation 4:1, Jesus says, "Come up here," and John goes up to heaven for visions of what will come but in the book of Rev. the church is not mentioned again.<br>  <br>  For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.<br>  And then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming.  II Thess. 2:7-8<br>  <br>  The lawless one is the Antichrist and he who now retrains is the body of Christ, the church.  When he is taken out of the way, the lawless one will be revealed but not before.  In other words the church has to leave (be raptured) before the Antichrist can be revealed.|`|LLey4VRzaa	It already happened...Matthew 27:52 and tombs opened.

He has to give us our "time" to prove to ourselves that we can not govern ourselves.  We do not see time as God does and it seems like a long time, but rest assured, Christ will come back and put an end to such suffering.  Those children and many billions of others will live again and be comforted.  Do not blame God, blame humanity.  If you have ever raised children you will see this nature in them when they become teenagers and young adults.  One cannot tell them what to do, they want to do it themselves, and as parents we have to let them fall and bloody their noses.  That's tough love.

Any contagious pathogen that can rob a person of free volition and make them uncontrollable, could bring about a crisis akin to a "Zombie Apocalypse".  Think of something similar to Alzheimer's and Mad Cow Disease.  This is nothing to joke about, it CAN happen.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	My husband and I have this theory about that.  It depends on what the infection started with (virus, pathogen, etc), how quickly the gestation process moves (if it's too fast, it would never spread world wide.  It would be stopped in its originating country before it ever had the chance to spread world wide), and the type that would be produced.  Shamblers seem to be the most popular but I don't think they're the most likely.  I think if there was a zombie war, it would be a combination of shamblers, sprinters, and the kind that have lower conscious thought processes.  If the period from infection to zombie reincarnation is anything less than say 3 or 4 days, it would happen too fast for it to spread world wide.  The infected would be detected long before it had the chance to cover the world.  (Playing an online game called Pandemic is one of the ways we test this theory).

The only people pushing such a conflict are the Churches since their financial and political bases are based on unquestioning obedience and acceptance by the laity of whatever the clergy say.

94aceb82c6668e0fc341436367b2d246aa	Let me let the Bible answer that.<br>  <br>  Exodus 20:4?“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. 5?You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them....<br>  <br>  John 4:23?Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him. 24?God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” <br>  <br>  Whereas humans are to imitate and endeavor to mirror the qualities of their heavenly Father and model their lives after his Son, the veneration of physical images in worship is consistently condemned throughout the Scriptures. God’s detestation of such practice was clearly expressed in the Law given to Israel. Not only carved images but the making of the “form” of anything in heaven, on earth, or in the sea as an object of religious worship was prohibited. (Ex 20:4,?5; Le 26:1; Isa 42:8) Such objects might be made of any substance, in any form—wood, metal, stone; carved, cast, hammered, hewn; in the figure of humans, animals, birds, inanimate objects, or just symbolic forms—but none were approved by God for veneration. The making of them was a ‘ruinous act,’ the committing of evil in Jehovah’s eyes, a detestable and offensive thing bringing his curse upon those doing so. (De 4:16-19, 23-25; 27:15; Nu 33:52; Isa 40:19,?20; 44:12,?13; Eze 7:20) The decking of them with gold and silver would not make them less disgusting in God’s sight nor prevent their being defiled and discarded as “mere dirt!”—De 7:5,?25; Isa 30:22.<br>  <br>  So, my answer is FALSE<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  You know, I don't see the loophole you're looking for.  What I see is God's word saying NOT to make ANYTHING...that would include, well, everything. Don't tell me that people don't kneel before crosses, pray holding them, etc.  What would you wear around your neck or whatever if Christ had been beheaded, also a form of roman execution.  Would you venerate the sword, would that be your 'symbol'?  It is the fact that he died for us, that ransom death that is important.  If you need 'symbols' are you really worshiping in spirit and truth.<br>  <br>  2?Cor. 5:7, NAB: “We walk by faith, not by sight.”<br>  <br>  Isa. 40:18, JB: “To whom could you liken God? What image could you contrive of him?”<br>  <br>  Acts 17:29, JB: “Since we are the children of God, we have no excuse for thinking that the deity looks like anything in gold, silver or stone that has been carved and designed by a man.(Yes, many 'crosses' have images on them.)

Also, the "Selfish gene" theory doesn't hold weight, and the most glaring thing the proves it is a maternity ward, or a fireman, etc. If we are "Selfish in nature" then why save somebody when it is not even in your best interest to do so?

LU94I1Kraa	Every thing is immoral to me, because it does not matter to me if you can read the the bible, pray, fast, tithing, do good in front of people. The point being is according to God's standard every single person is immoral. I believe I am a moral person (not on my own account) but only because I am in Jesus Christ. He is my righteousness. Only in him can any one be a moral person and you don't get this by reading a bible or doing something good. You can only get this by believing in him. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart Jesus died on the cross and on the third day he was raised from the dead.|`|U81o09nHaa	I'm about an 8 on my own scale of morality  I don't kill or steal. I'm not a jealous or envious person although sometimes I think, "Why haven't I created that reality in my life? I like that!"<br>  <br>  I think turning your back on someone in need is immoral. I think reviling the poor and the homeless is despicable.  I think judging the street alcoholics, tweakers and junkies is arrogant and highly immoral.  Who are we to decide how horrible their lives have been that lead them to this?<br>  <br>  I met a gorgeous man last year who swept me off my feet but he told me he was married.  I ended the relationship, not for any religious reason but because I thought he should be a man and either work things out with his wife or end it. But I didn't think it was fair that he should be able to have a mistress AND a wife and get ALL the cookies while his wife and I got none.  I sure cared about him though.<br>  <br>  So, now I''m watching the Oscars alone tonight and I have my favourite TV shows that I've become addicted to. (Not ALL non-religious people are running around humping every stranger in alleyways and subway stations).<br>  <br>  Pornography is no big deal as long as you realize those women aren't doing what women want. They're doing what men get off on watching. It's not real.  Child porn should be punishable by castration tho.|`|R4WuWXnpaa	8 because i was tought moras and have strong belies about what is acceptable and what is not but sometimes i decide to slack at what  is right and what i shouldent be doing|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I think I'm moral.  I work darned hard, I don't expect things to be handed to me, and I'm a loyal friend.

Are you saying you think pornography is immoral and many others don't or that many think it is immoral and you don't?<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think there is anything immoral about pornography.<br>  <br>  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would consider myself an 8 or 9. Sometimes (rarely) I transgress against my better judgment, but normally I behave in a responsible and respectful manner towards individuals and society as a whole.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	I don't understand the scale you're proposing.  "Moralistic" is an individual thing.  Some people find it moral to take evolution out of school textbooks.  I think that's shocking, horrible, and about the most immoral thing I can think of.  But a conservative Christian would disagree.<br>  <br>  Also I question those who take their morals from the Bible as I don't think anyone would argue that it contains a tremendous amount of violence, hatred, misogyny, homophobia, etc.|`|2f7881b6eca5299515f3da1bd060562daa	This is a tough one to battle......Sex before marriage.<br>  Pornography?

TbKuuIDEaa	I like them.  I am not gay though, but I guess this doesn't matter - so anyway.  yeah thongs are comfortable and I like cute undies.  I think guys should have as good of underwear options as guys.  plus, my gf likes them on me.  get a good pair (like N2N) and the right size and just try them.  Once you get used to them they are comfy.  they give support wear you need it, in the front, and none wear you don't, on the butt cheeks.  and you can always try it and then not wear them if you don't like them.  as for like being seen by others, I wear them all the time, even to the gym.  I have been hit on a couple of times, but I just say, I am straight.  anyway, good luck dude.|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Go for it if you want. <br>  <br>  I dont wear them, never really thought about them either... but hey! they wouldn't be on sale if they weren't getting sold!<br>  <br>  :)|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Im Gay and I dont wear thongs<br>  I would never wear thongs but some guys look hot in thongs.

zZxX5PXBaa	I thought it was a poor episode. As was Anne Widdecombe's. Michael Portillo did a very good job of giving a fair, balanced view of history, whereas this latest one and Anne Widdecombe's were grossly one-sided and, at times, bizarre. Anne W. did the entire Reformation giving justification by faith about three sentences in an hour of television.<br>  <br>  The chap tonight kept saying 'science was invented 400 years ago', thereby neatly editing classical science out of the picture entirely (what about Eratosthenes, measuring the earth's diameter in the BCE?). And editing out Islamic science completely. And when he got onto the Enlightenment he mentioned Newton briefly (he could hardly avoid him entirely, since Newton's Principia is widely regarded as the most important scientific text of the last thousand years) but he dived quickly into Franklin, presumably to avoid facing the fact of Newton's passionate (if odd) Christian faith.<br>  <br>  As a piece of argument, I'm afraid I found it very unimpressive. Hard to respect the man's integrity.|`|iYW2ZVuFaa	Yes, I watched it earlier. <br>  <br>  "If scientific data contradicts the Bible then science is the one that has fallen short".<br>  <br>  - American Scientist/Minister<br>  <br>  These are not the words of a Scientist (despite what he thought about himself).

I'm contemplating leaving warning messages like: "This is a work of fiction.  Any resemblance to any person or place, living or dead, is highly unlikely."|`|5Vh51eazaa	i am guessing your trying to get people to read the bibles? people would probably just look for the 1$ if they cared enough to try to find it . . . . kind of funny tho ^_^|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	I would leave a $5 bill in every Bible, and say on an attached note, "There's more where that came from if you disregard this."|`|P5AgKF9Yaa	are there bibles in every hotel room in america????? wtf?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	How would I react?  I'm putting it right in my pocket especially now that you've told me that's what you plan on doing.|`|NWopkX4baa	You'd probably find them still there decades later.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	I would say people would be pleasantly surprised to find $1 in the hotel room Bible. If, in fact, they even found it. There are two reasons the next person to stay in the hotel room would not find the cash in the Bible.<br>  <br>  1) Very few people turn to the hotel Bibles. I mean, even my husband and I prefer to carry our own.<br>  <br>  2) Even if the hotel maid doesn't do a thorough cleaning job, they do look very thoroughly for any cash, jewelry, or other valuables that might have been left behind. This includes leafing through those Bible pages, since the idea of people leaving money in hotel Bibles is actually a very old urban legend.<br>  <br>  However, whoever DOES end up with the cash would probably be very grateful, whether a traveler who is turning to the Bible in a time of need or simply out of intrest, or the maid almost nobody tips and who is probably not making more than minimum wage.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	So what is your hope?    I don't really understand what kind of message you are trying send.   Are you thinking that if you leave a $1 in a bible someone may actually decide to read the book?<br>  <br>  People aren't stupid,  they would probably figure out that the money was placed there intentionally.  I doubt anyone would believe that it was used as a bookmark.   And if you are leaving the money there as an act of kindness then a dollar bill is an insult to anyone.<br>  Of course people are still going to take the money and think whoever left it there was an idiot.<br>  <br>  How are people going to react to you?   They don't know you so how can they react to you.   Now if you are blowing your own trumpet and telling everyone what you have been doing you will just look like a self righteous,  holier than thou @%**.|`|gIOYhmsTaa	You  should leave a post-it with the dollar that says 'this dollar has been in the butt crack of a stripper'|`|hXQjnPuGaa	They would still be there years later because noone ever reads the hotel bibles.<br>  <br>  If anyone ever did find it in there they'd just take it.

Before that title 'saint' just came about by popular usage and the acceptance of the church.<br>  <br>  St Monica was regarded as a saint for her personal holiness, her fulfillment of the ideal of a Christian wife, and for her long perseverance in prayer for the conversion of her son.<br>  <br>  St. Augustine was chiefly noted for his writings and preaching. He is regarded as one of the greatest theologians of all time and many of his works, including the 'Confessions', are still widely read and cited today.<br>  <br>  If you need more information than this, then just do a Google search or look up these saints on Wikipedia. But be careful when you search because there are two different St Augustines. Make sure that the information you get is about St. Augustine of Hippo, not St. Augustine of Canterbury.

x2cKYj10aa	No. In America people have to become citizens and are then accepted as Americans. Also, in the US there is an obsession with race. <br>  See some of the US genealogy questions _"I am one eighth Native American" " I am half Irish" etc.<br>  In the UK nothing similar has existed til recently so any person is just known by their original nationality, except that if they are born in the UK they are British, regardless of parent's nationality.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	the pc name for blacks here is afro-carribean. but this is only used on research or forms. i would think that everybody here (including non-blacks) just says 'black'.|`|v5BwnUZdaa	We have Britons and immigrant scum, it doesn't really matter where they come from none are welcome.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	That reminds me to ask what is the difference between an English and a Briton.

Explain.|`|8cac5996dfa4b74cef2a5b4b88deb987aa	I have no idea. Maybe because of the British Empire and the fact that a person who who might describe themselves as "British" can have origins in countries as diverse as England, India and Papua New Guinea. In his book "A Passage to India" (1924), E.M. Forster's characters describe theselves as "British" as opposed to English, so it is clear that this has been an accepted form of self-identity (for some) for quite a long time. <br>  <br>  By the way, the term "Paki" is offensive to me. I cannot speak for anyone else.|`|HGXvemheaa	Because in the U.S people believe that where you ancestor's came from, or where you came from specifically, is very much a part of you and is important to be proud of and recognised.<br>  <br>  It is not something to be looked negatively upon.|`|3e3e62517150959968d9185882de85ebaa	Holy crap. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of black people in England, and Italians.

ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim<br>  <br>  Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br>  <br>  Wow, sounds like a big step to make, to travel to another country to marry.  Yes, you must have a wali, a guardian, in order for your marriage to be valid.  Since your father is not Muslim he cannot act as your wali regardless.  I would say the Imaam where your fiance's people usually pray, or another educated Muslim, can stand as your wali.  You might want to get a certificate from your local masjid here stating that you are a revert to Islam so you won't have any difficulties in Syria.  <br>  <br>  Please contact me at zaugatmisr@yahoo.com with questions.  I have been married 10 years, Muslim for 15, and I have a lot of questions for YOU about this man, about going to a foreign country, etc.  I just want to make sure you are going into this with your eyes open and that nothing bad happens.  <br>  <br>  Fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|UhyvM73iaa	Get a sworn statement from your father notorized by Notary Public saying that you are his daughter and he permits you to marry -----------<br>  -------------(your fiance).   If your father doesn't permit you to marry a Muslim, then Imam in Syria will become your Wali and will marry you.<br>  <br>  This condition of Wali is for Muslim girls from Muslim families for her protection. It is only for first marriage. Usually girls have no experience at young age and some slick good looking guy can lure them for promise of marriage, take then away without permission of her family.<br>  He marrys her,  has fun for a while and later sells her to pimps. Then she is  forced to become prostitute.  It happens in some countries.  For this reason requirement of Wali in Islam for first marriage of girl is  for her protection.<br>  <br>  In your case as I said  Imam will be pleased to become your Wali and shall perform your marriage with the Muslim finance.|`|ILc1XIPraa	In the case of a revert , I think the imam can stand in as your wali. You still need witnesses, but i really think the Imam can be your wali. I would have the sister who helped me revert at my wedding if i can , insha'Allah.  Allah swt knows best . Ask your local masjid.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	You can appoint an Imam in Syria as your wali.|`|wGQvgeXDaa	Since you are a revert, the Imam can stand as your Wali.|`|DTFsNJxpaa	I have read in hanafi Fique a revert does not need a wali, but even prophet muhammed (pbuh) has said that a marriage is not valid if there is no wali.<br>  <br>  <br>  An imaam can be appointed as your wali.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Sister, please e-mail me. You will need a wali if you do not already have one. If you do have one, but he is not able to come with you, then he can represent you by phone. If you do not have one then you should make arrangements to speak to an Imam that can act in your behalf. Your Wali can NOT be a friend or family member of your future Husband. Best Wishes.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

God has always been he is Alpha and Omega ( The Beginning and the End) but one day iin  Gods Holy Kingdom there was an Mighty Angel and his name was Lucifer. He was the most beautiful Angel in Heaven and he rose up against GOD and brought with him a 3rd of the Angels in Heaven to over throw GOD but you see GOD already knew about his intentions and he cast Lucifer out with the 3rd of the Angels down to this World where he was until GOD said let me make a friend for us a Son to fellowship with and I will make him in my image and call him man, well he made a help mate for man, the woman and he told them you can have free will over all of the land, but do not eat of the tree of life in the garden for you will surley die. Well Lucifer was hearing this conversation and knowinly tempted Woman and she took the fruit and ate it and gave Man the fruit and he ate it and when they did they kew they were no longer in GODs perfect will , and GOD turned Lucifer into satin and we call him devil , he is the prince of the air and he makes sure your kids hear flith and junk through music over the radio, TV and CD's, there is your evil right there.  GOD gives you and anyone else a choice, he will not be a dictator to you but he will give you the choice to be good or to be bad. The ones who choose to be bad well they don't know GOD be cause he is all good and satin is all bad. Satin is not a scary ugly freak, he can be the prettiest girl or woman you have ever seen or the most handsome man or guy you have ever seen and they can be the most evil filled person on this earth.

I know I was born gay.<br>  I knew I was different before I knew what sexuality was.|`|HAHDipTAaa	I knew I was different at the age of five when I was caught by my sister with my hand on the willy of the boy next door - Paulo came out to his family when he was twelve and we both know we were born gay|`|J7HTo1psaa	Yes, i think we are.  I found out when i was 7 ^^|`|sVkBdQ28aa	I was six when I fell for a guy for the first time. I never considered girls prior to that. Or after for that matter.|`|KyHYOKmQaa	I was 14 when I realized I was bi, and yes I think I was born that way. When I think back I remember things like staring at women's breasts and whatnot, haha, so yes I think the potential for me to become bi has always been there. However, I needed something to bring it out, and in my case it was a tomboy girl in my class who was constantly teasing me, she made me fall for her.<br>  <br>  I don't see it like an 'abnormality in my genes' or anything like that though, it's just a personality trait like any other. Just like I'm left handed and artistic. I'm sure you Could find the exact gene that makes you lean towards a specific thing, but why would we need to find the gene for bi and homosexuality? I'm happy the way I am, I don't want to be straight, if I was I wouldn't be me.|`|QoTHYHfeaa	I definitely think I was born a lesbian. I mean, it took me a while to come out as bi and then a bit longer to just admit to myself and everybody else that I've always liked girls, but that was the probably because of the front society has everybody put up. I think that if we lived in a world where children see somebody with two mommies or daddies just as much as they see "normal" parents, single parents, and other sorts of parenting situations, then homosexuals, bisexuals, and every other type of sexual orientation would come out a lot earlier and a lot more comfortably.|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	4th grade, but i didn't realize what I had was a crush until later. Definitely born lesbian, would never chose something so hard, would rather be single than with a guy and unhappy.|`|GOYuWN4zaa	the reason i think i was born gay is because i remember being like 6 or 7 in girl scouts running trying to get a gurl to kiss me.<br>  i came to terms with being gay last year ( 9th grade ) i'd say you dont really realize it you more of accept it.|`|YVSIje93aa	I don't think so. I know so.<br>  12.<br>  I know I was.|`|pJzeUd0Haa	I think so because I knew wen I was about 6|`|8tYaHBEKaa	15 and yes i suppose i do think i was, cos i would not choose it. even tho i see nothing wrong, its just the stigma you get|`|8Y583Fluaa	society said any hole will do|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	no, and i was 13, when i realized i was bi|`|uky2nsh8aa	no, i KNOW i was born Pansexual. thank you very much.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	I knew I was different all the way back in preschool... I was 5 when I had my first boy crush.. I didn't realize I was "gay" until about 8 or 9. At 9 I was threatening to kill myself because I hated being different and I knew that being gay meant I'd never get married and have kids.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Yes, I do. I figured out what was different in the way I felt when puberty kicked in.|`|19QSiNqgaa	nope I was recruited at age 11 by a man on my paper route. Tracked him down years later with the help of the police. Guess what.. he's gay!!
hXyYCpGraa	If contraception interferes with God's plan, and God has a plan for the beginning to end of every life, then nobody should use contraception of any kind, since God must have planned abortions.<br>  Stupid ******* Christian bullshit.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	Not having sex also interferes with God's Plan.<br>  We should have as much sex as possible, because God wants us to.|`|zEoRcL91aa	I really don't think god cares.

He first got the idea stopping by a meeting with an SDA bible group, but didn't totally go with ALL their ideas, He started a group called bible students, then after his passing in 1914 a few years later in the 1930's under their new pastor/president "Judge Rutheford" they got it passed in the courts by naming themselves "Jehovah's Witnesses" as stated in Isaiah out of the bible.<br>  To know more about the full history of the Jehovah's Witnesses beginnings do a google search on Charles T. Russell & Judge rutheford. but their main website gives what they do today at www.watchtower.org|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	A born-again Christian is someone who has repented of their sins and turned to Christ for their salvation, and as a result has become part of God's family forever. All this takes place as God's Spirit works in our lives.<br>  <br>  You see, by nature we aren't members of God's family, and we don't have any right to inherit eternal life. The reason is because of our sin. We have rebelled against God, and because of that, the Bible says, we are "separated from the life of God ... due to the hardening of (our) hearts" (Ephesians 4:18). No, you may not see yourself as a bad person (and you probably aren't)—but in God's eyes even one sin is enough to keep you out of heaven.<br>  <br>  But Jesus Christ came to save us and to make us part of His family forever! He did this by dying for our sins on the cross and by conquering death through His resurrection. You see, as a human being you were born into a family—and nothing can ever change that. But when we come to Christ we are spiritually reborn into another family—the family of God. The Bible says to Christ's followers, "You have been born again ... through the living and enduring word of God" (1 Peter 1:23).<br>  <br>  My prayer is that you too may be born again and become part of God's family. By a simple prayer of faith, tell God that you know you are a sinner, and you are sorry for your sins. Then ask Christ to come into your life and save you. When you do, God will come to live within you by His Spirit, and you will be born again.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|RspbqyzDaa	A Christian is one who believes and trusts in Jesus.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	A person who believes in the legend of Jesus Christ as a savior of mankind.|`|tpDICzslaa	I would define a Christian as someone who has been baptised according to the trinitarian formula, accepts the validity of the New Testament and who worships God whilst seeking to live their life according to the teachings of Christ.<br>  <br>  I was tempted to included other criteria, but if I added acceptance of the Nicene creed I suspect that might lead to the ancient Non-Chalcedonian churches being described as non-christian. And if I made acceptance of the full cannon of the Old Testament a criterium, that would exclude almost all Protestants.
9YMLsk7Taa	Thou shall have no other Gods besides Me.

I am not making excuses or denials to you, i do not have to. They got the punishment God felt they deserved. I'm not arguing that!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I don't have denials or excuses because there is nothing to react to. <br>  <br>  If you believe the incident, then all you can be objecting to is something that the participants in the story wouldn't have understood.

AA11232725	God has given us his Word to make known his will for our lives here on earth. Before the Bible was compiled and printed His-story was still unfolding.<br>  <br>  God does show up in people's lives today in miraculous ways. Most people don't find out about it because now that the Lord Jesus has made a way for people to be reconciled to God as their Heavenly Father He doesn't have to do new miraculous signs like parting the Red Sea that would make it into the newspapers. Go to a church where they have testimony time and you will hear how God still works miracles on a smaller and more personal scale.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Blessed are those who have seen and believed.  Even more blessed are those who have not seen and still believe.  Who do you think he was talking about?

I've seen questions like this before too and usually they say that he is still doing things all around us. *shrugs* I don't see it.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	I see my God everywhere i look, maybe you are missing Him cause you are not truly looking.|`|4B3f0hI4aa	I see God everyday when I look into the eyes of my little granddaughter who was born 2 months early, yet she was totally complete. <br>  I see God every time I look at my daughter who laid in a hospital bed swelling, in pain, not able to breath, kidney's shutting down, internal bleeding for 3 days before her care taker finally realized how sick she was and sent her to Duke Medical Center. I had asked God to hold her in the palm of his hand and keep her alive............and he did.<br>  God is still pro-active in our lives. He's not shy at all. It's just that some of us don't recognize him. How sad.|`|azD1REoEaa	No because the Bible is finished and that is the only proof we need.<br>  <br>  God would at times intervene in a dramatic fashion in order that He may demonstrate his plan of salvation to the world.   If you look closely at the Old Testament stories many of them reveal God's salvation plan.  For instance we read about the testing of Abraham in Genesis 22.   If you take a step further you can see this shadows that of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and what God would eventually do to His only son that the blessing of salvation may come to the whole world and all nations on earth would be blessed.   If we take a close look at Exodus we can see this also points to God's plan of redemption for mankind.   <br>  <br>  These events would eventually be written down and formed into the Holy Bible.   Now that the Bible is complete there is no need to dramatically intervene like what we have seen in the Old Testament.  The Bible is now the tool God uses to dramatically intervene in peoples lives to breath spiritual life into them and this is what is most important.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Actually, God made only a few appearances throughout all of the old testament, and those were typically hundreds and even thousands of years apart.<br>  <br>  After Jesus went back to heaven, God left it up to the Church to handle things, in the interim.<br>  <br>  Don't worry. He'll be back soon enough.|`|tpDICzslaa	What makes you think God is silent and not performing any miracles at the moment?

M644qmI0aa	To make the card better make the following changes:<br>  <br>  Trying to transfer home ownership of someone who has passed away? We can help you generate a settlement or resolve property disputes over the estate.<br>  <br>  Our Services:<br>  Represent you as a relative....<br>  Pay delinquent...<br>  Receive cash.....<br>  <br>  Call us. Unresolved problems don't go away on their own.<br>  We're available 24 hours a day, everyday.<br>  <br>  1) delete unnecessary phrases like:<br>    a. "or can't be found" even though you can transfer home ownership of a person who can't be found, is this normal or necessary to list on a business card?<br>    b. "We know the court system" if the company is a hired attorney, you should know the court system already.<br>    c. "subject/subject's" you can't have property disputes over the subject. Calling a person a subject seems cold. The subject is already mentioned in the first sentence. The estate's owner is implied.<br>    d. "Benefit with options to choose from" seems long and isn't a complete phrase. We can benefit from options. "to choose from" is redundant, if you have an option, of course you can choose from one of them.<br>    e. "today" if you're giving them the card, do you want them to call you today, even if you're looking right at them?<br>  <br>  2) Get rid of technical jargon. doesn't look like you have a whole lot. see if you can re-word some of your sentences.<br>  3) Consider your target audience. If you are giving these cards to people who you are sure are going to call or people you are already in contact with, why give them the "Unresolved problems" bit? There are other parts of the card that sound like a phone book ad (which is good If you're handing the card to people who haven't contacted you before), you may want to edit both front and back or delete the paragraphs altogether.<br>  3.5) Change "We're here 24/7" its small, unnoticable, and not memorable.<br>  4) ensure you have a website that's clean and operating. Even though they can call you 24/7, personally, I wont call unless I know what I'm getting into. A website is less confrontational than a phone call.<br>  5) Consider a brochure instead of a card. A brochure sized card (3 2/3"x 8 1/2") can hold additional graphics and more information.<br>  <br>  I hate how perogatory this answer sounds...sorry. *~*

The idea that each life is a reward or punishment for the last one actually makes very little sense when you consider how many bad people have great lives, which is why modern Christians misrepresent reincarnation that way.  Don't forget that until the 3rd century many Christian sects also believed in reincarnation, as have a lot of other faiths, the concept is too varied and complex to pick just one version and act as if that were the whole of it.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	This is why the whole reincarnation beliefs are wacky.

The bottom-line explanation is found in the idea of karma; when we do motivated positive actions, we create the causes for happiness and fortunate rebirths, when we do negative actions, we create the causes for misery in the future. <br>  <br>  As an animal has a very limited amount of intellect and choice or motivation, it is unlikely that an animal can do much 'good' or 'bad' for the next rebirth. So it is likely that the actions (karma) done in a life before this life will determine where an animal will be reborn.  <br>  <br>  A simple example: if a dog has been a human in his previous life, then some negative actions during that human life may have caused him to be reborn as a dog. During a life as a dog, very limited good or bad actions can be done (with a clear motivation), so perhaps another positive or negative action done during his life as human will determine the next rebirth. If that is another negative action, perhaps the dog will again be reborn as animal, if the action of the past was very positive, he may have a chance for a human life again. <br>  <br>  In this way, being reborn as an animal is considered quite negative, also because the animal has little control over his future suffering or happiness. At least as a human we can make conscious decisions that will affect our future.|`|BPO6roTOaa	Or maybe like....an earthworm.

MXMMlSJPaa	Yes I do Believe there is life after death with the hand of our Lord|`|c3512f9d86066e8758051d031b18adeeaa	I'm a Buddhist so yes I do.  I do think that there is a common misconception of reincarnation. <br>  <br>  Thich Nhat Hanh gives a good summary of what is meant by re-incarnation -- it's not necessarily the idea that someone goes from body to body...<br>  <br>      At first, we might think of reincarnation as a soul entering a body. The body is seen as impermanent and the soul as permanent, and when we get rid of one body, we re-enter another. You might be surprised to know that people in Buddhist Asia are not fond of reincarnation. They want the circle of birth and death to end because they know it represents suffering without end.<br>  <br>      ....<br>      The Buddha taught that a so-called "person" is really just five elements (skandhas) that come together for a limited period of time: our body, feelings, perceptions, mental states and consciousness. These five elements are, in fact, changing all the time. Not a single element remains the same for two consecutive moments.<br>  <br>      Not only is our body impermanent, but our so-called soul is also impermanent. It, too, is comprised only of elements like feelings, perceptions, mental states, and consciousness. When the idea of an immortal soul is replaced, our understanding of reincarnation gets closer to the truth.<br>  <br>      ....<br>      But if we observe the things around us, we find that nothing comes from nothing. Before its so-called birth, the flower already existed in other forms -- clouds, sunshine, seeds, soil, and many other elements. Rather than birth and rebirth, it is more accurate to say "manifestation" (vij?apti) and "remanifestation." The so-called birthday of the flower is really a day of its remanifestation. It has already been here in other forms, and now it has made an effort to remanifest. Manifestation means its constituents have always been here in some form, and now, since conditions are sufficient, it is capable of manifesting itself as a flower. When things have manifested, we commonly say they are born, but in fact, they are not. When conditions are no longer sufficient and the flower ceases to manifest, we say the flower has died, but that is not correct either. Its constituents have merely transformed themselves into other elements, like compost and soul.<br>  <br>      Thich Nhat Hanh, Living Buddha, Living Christ (New York: Riverhead Books, 1995), pp 133-135|`|UqgCazhGaa	Bg 15.8 P         The Yoga of the Supreme Person<br>      At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.<br>  <br>  SB 4.29.64 P Talks Between Narada and King Pracinabarhi<br>     In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Yes, I do.|`|7b56875ec783eb5fc0c599bfcdfd5ce5aa	No|`|AA11811299	no|`|EMVT2xjEaa	no|`|shcnDVHsaa	I'm a Buddhist.|`|HnMJtjjZaa	No I don't I do believe in rebirth which is somewhat different<br>  As a Buddhist I don't believe there is anything permanent to reincarnate Everything is impermanent including what is termed the Alaya Consciousness which many Buddhist believe undergoes rebirth This Alaya Consciousness is a store house if you will  of all our past and present Karma an imprint of every experience thought action we have ever experienced not only from our present life but also from all our past ones too We also believe it is Karma plus Desire which dictates our next rebirth <br>  I wish you well|`|Gozebrhtaa	Yes and each time i return to live another Human Life: I remember much sooner and quicker why i keep coming back...We come back to help save the world from more suffering just like Jesus did!!!! <br>  <br>  To create a more peaceful place for Awareness and non judgment, non-violence to exist along with forgiveness...<br>  <br>  I am God and We are all One!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Love and Peace Slipperygirl|`|53gxXjaOaa	ha reincarnation to an extent is true!<br>  <br>  all living beings are made of organic matter. there is only a set amount and more cant be made by humans as of yet.<br>  <br>  so all living things are made of recycled organic matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  booyah!<br>  <br>  ?_?|`|5shqstYraa	No as this is not biblical|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	Ha!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No|`|P5AgKF9Yaa	i used to be a rainworm|`|3m00lxxuaa	No, because let me ask, does anyone actually remember a past life or lives?

FALSE CHRISTIANS have their hands in every sort of debauchery, what goes against truthful Godly and Bible standards, such as political influence, wars, celebrating pagan holidays, lying, committing fraud, forgeries, liars -- SOME OF THE BIGGEST LIARS are false Christians, cheating on taxes, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and the list is never-ending --- they are just like the worldly people, and guess who's misleading the entire inhabited world at this time? None other than Satan himself, but he knows he has but a short time left. <br>  <br>  Beware of false Christians, and those who claim to love God, but their actions prove otherwise.<br>  <br>  True Christians are not interested in "losing political power" because we don't delve into political worldy matters, you see?<br>  <br>  Your Jew comment is very racist also and insulting to anyone who is a Jew.

d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Think of it this way. Let's say enlightenment is like the roof of a tall building. Once we are on the roof, we no longer have to hold on to the ladder. But what happens if we let go of the ladder before we get to the roof? *Trying* to be unattached before enlightenment is exactly the same. Detachment is a product of enlightenment, and in that state is completely integrated with compassion, etc. Those who teach detachment as a way to *get* enlightened are simply confused, about the way growth of consciousness works and about what Buddha actually taught.|`|czXaUPIlaa	Maybe this will help you understand the what the "Idiot's Guide" is trying to explain.<br>  <br>  Imagine that you have a very ripe peach resting in the palm of your hand. (The peach could symbolize a human relationship.)<br>  <br>  If you clench your hand into a fist, you will squeeze the peach into mush and destroy its beauty. That's attachment.<br>  <br>  If you simply hold the peach, you can bite into it and enjoy its sweet, luscious flavor. Even better, you can offer it to a hungry person, thereby easing suffering. That's non-attachment.<br>  <br>  When we clench the heart and mind, we damage the great beauty of life, including the relationships upon which our happiness depends. <br>  <br>  When we soften the heart and mind, we can ease life's profound suffering and our relationships will expand with great joy. That's the point of Buddhist practice.|`|shcnDVHsaa	Well, obviously you haven't gotten the bigger picture. All things are impermanent. Except Nirvana. It is wrong, but to be wrong is to be human.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We 'can' develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|Kf2JUEPVaa	See "Attachment in Buddhism" at <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ryunyo/attachment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/ryunyo/attachme...</a><br>  <br>  I liked neil s's answer with the tall building and the ladder.

h0rWnvx1aa	Family Of A Murderer Father!<br>  <br>  In Fairmont, West Virginia, there is a small house and rumor has it that the house is haunted. My mom told me a story about when she was a young girl, the house was occupied by a family who no one really knew anything about. Everyone in the neighborhood was afraid of them. My mom went to school with the youngest girl in the family, who looked tired all the time and never spoke a word. Her dad was even more scarier and looked as if he was always mad. The girl seemed afraid of him. Nobody thought this was unusual because everyone was afraid of him, until one night. The police were at the house, but the neighbors didn't know why they were there. The next day, my mom and her classmates found out what had happened. The father came home that night drunk and beat his wife and children to death. Then he went into his truck, set it on fire and shot himself in the head. Now they say, if you go anywhere near the house you can hear the painful screams of the family being brutally murdered by the father.|`|g5gFcspDaa	Well this is actually a true story, but my aunt's friend used to live in a house built on property where the underground railroad took place.

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	It's a cult.<br>  <br>  Scientology, which questionably calls itself a new "religion", is the brainchild of 1950’s science fiction writer & occult enthusiast L. Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbard’s self created psychotherapy technique called “Dianetics”, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their “treatment” of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#Scientific_evaluation_and_criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics#S...</a> <br>  Dianetics review: <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/2005/06/28/dianetics/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/detox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&columns/feature.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...</a> <br>  <br>  Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of “levels”. One begins as a “preclear” & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end.

Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientology’s belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during “past lives”) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day.

It doesn’t recognize legitimate conditions like autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ANY neurological disorder / chemical imbalance at all, & the “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from members (often with harmful & deadly results). The “Church” blames psychiatry for the Holocaust, as well as school shootings & even September 11th. It’s been suggested that Hubbard’s vehement opposition was born of the psychiatric community’s rejection of his “tech” as a valid treatment method, but it’s also possible that Hubbard chose psychiatry as a scapegoat. Organizations like Scientology are notorious for villainizing a specific out-group because their “stand against the enemy” fosters cohesion within said organization, & psychiatry was an effective rallying point considering many people already distrust & oppose the mental health profession. <br>  <a href="http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scientology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/usa-scie...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=3137&IssueNum=136" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id...</a> <br>  <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://perkinstragedy.org" rel="nofollow">http://perkinstragedy.org</a> <br>  <br>  L. Ron Hubbard, the man behind the creation of Scientology, was & still is a controversial figure. Biographies & lists of personal accomplishments differ greatly between Scientology & non-Scientology publications as the “church” tends to exaggerate & outright lie about his early life, his education, his travels, his achievements etc, preferring to paint a distorted, flattering picture. Several books & articles present facts which flatly contradict these church-published accounts (links to free online copies of these books & articles are provided below), showing conclusively that he was NOT the brilliant, accomplished figure revered by Scientologists. During his autopsy, the sedative Vistaril? was present in his body, which several of his assistants would later attest was only one of many psychiatric & pain medications Hubbard ingested over the years. It had also been said by many who knew Hubbard personally that at the end of his life he was “a psychopathic insane person screaming about BT's [Body Thetans]…” <br>  <a href="http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Bare%20Faced%20Messiah.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Bare%20F...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/atack/contents.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mom/Messiah_or_Madman.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/mo...</a> <br>  <a href="http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/scientology/essays/jeff-hubbard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/scientology/es...</a> <br>  <br>  To be blunt, Scientology is a cult.

It bullies all known critics, opponents, “enemies”, etc, often through malicious litigation & character assassination. It’s a particularly greedy as well as manipulative & dangerous cult that takes its anti-psychiatry fanaticism to deadly limits. <br>  <a href="http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/harass.htm#start" rel="nofollow">http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/hara...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialControl/scs.html#toc" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialContr...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampab...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/personal_story/funkydonny.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xenu.net/archive/personal_sto...</a>|`|UinOWcMUaa	Scientology is a body of beliefs and related practices created by American science fiction author L.

The gist is that it's supposed to help you live a more successful life by helping you communicate better, be more powerful, and reach a higher spiritual level.  They believe in reincarnation, teaching that people's souls are millions of years old.  They're also violently opposed to psychiatry, viewing it as an evil conspiracy to drug people up, control them, and ruin their lives.<br>  <br>  One of the first things members do are some very strange "communications courses," which involve forms of hypnosis and are moderately expensive.  Things get progressively more intense from there.  At the highest levels, they teach that people's problems are caused by alien parasites.  They sell courses costing thousands of dollars and are very aggressive at getting people's money.<br>  <br>  They also have a criminal history that they don't want you to know about. They're known for strong-armed tactics against critics, and their "Operation Snow White" in the 1970's was the largest infiltration of the U.S. government in history.

One being Witchvox at <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/.</a> Here you will gain knowledge through fellowship with other of like mind and knowledge through the countless articles posted. If this is not enough one could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at <a href="http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour..." rel="nofollow">http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour...</a> or OZ Wicca at <a href="http://www.ozwicca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozwicca.com/</a> , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web.<br>  <br>  Also if you are close enough to a group that specializes in education and development like the SCWF try and join them even if it’s on a limited capacity, you can find several local to you on Witchvox.com. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.<br>  <br>  I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. Also you cannot go wrong with anything by Scott Cunningham.<br>  <br>  If you are teen, I suggest Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf and Elements of Witchcraft: Natural Magick for Teens by Ellen Dugan.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|dFBccLExaa	You can email me if you like, I'll answer what I can.|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	no you don't need a teacher.<br>  <br>  you can message me i am not an expert but i have been reading for about .. 9 years or so.<br>  <br>  just read many different books|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	When you want to learn about something, what do you do?

Four days after the injury was sustained a shapeshifter will change shape for the first time. The new shapeshifter will have no control over the change and this is the most common way for a shapeshifter to kill a human. Most clans have strict rules about attacking humans, and if a human is injured they do all they can to keep the human away from humans for four days. Clans have been known to kidnap injured humans just to be safe. Occasionally an injured human will not shapeshift after four days, but usually a deep injury means infection.

Salvation in the kingdom of God is dependent on the grace of God.<br>  Agreed.<br>  <br>  14. Salvation is also dependent on the works of the individual.<br>  No.  You need to try to love God and this should affect what you do, but you can't buy/volunteer your way in.

Here are the race categories in the U.S.;   Race Categories<br>  <br>      * American Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.<br>  <br>      * Asian: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.<br>  <br>      * Black or African American: A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as "Haitian" or "Negro" can be used in addition to "Black or African American".<br>  <br>      * Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.<br>  <br>      * White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.<br>  <br>  Ethnicity Categories<br>  <br>      * Hispanic or Latino: A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, "Spanish origin", can be used in addition to "Hispanic or Latino".<br>  <br>      * Not Hispanic of Latino<br>  <br>  Further data;<br>  The notion of race is nearly as problematic from a scientific point of view as it is from a social one. European physical anthropologists of the 17th and 18th centuries proposed various systems of racial classifications based on such observable characteristics as skin color, hair type, body proportions, and skull measurements, essentially codifying the perceived differences among broad geographic populations of humans. The traditional terms for these populations—Caucasoid (or Caucasian), Mongoloid, Negroid, and in some systems Australoid—are now controversial in both technical and nontechnical usage, and in some cases they may well be considered offensive. (Caucasian does retain a certain currency in American English, but it is used almost exclusively to mean “white” or “European” rather than “belonging to the Caucasian race,” a group that includes a variety of peoples generally categorized as nonwhite.) The biological aspect of race is described today not in observable physical features but rather in such genetic characteristics as blood groups and metabolic processes, and the groupings indicated by these factors seldom coincide very neatly with those put forward by earlier physical anthropologists. Citing this and other points—such as the fact that a person who is considered black in one society might be nonblack in another—many cultural anthropologists now consider race to be more a social or mental construct than an objective biological fact.|`|5IkvPgfuaa	Because only those nationalites that have a significant population here have their own category.<br>  <br>  There are about 195 countries in the world and they cant each have there own.|`|CvSKPHiqaa	well there are loads more chinese peeps here than filipinos and viets. there are hardly any japanese and koreans here too.i suppose you would just tick 'other'
hceNM6Uxaa	Actually, what really puzzles me is that some questions/answers/accounts get deleted for no good reason, while the most vile questions/answers/users stay, despite reporting by a large number of people.  Any notion that there is an automatic violation notice when a certain number of people report has been disproved - someone, somewhere, is making some choices and there do appear to be some very prejudicial judgements being made.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	I don't know what "owness" is, but here's how it works. <br>  <br>  When you report a question, it pretty much gets deleted automatically, and a violation notice is sent to the person whose question was reported. A person gets too many violation notices, and their account gets deleted. <br>  <br>  The report monkeys know that Yahoo workers DO NOT CHECK to see if the TOS was actually violated. If you receive a violation notice, then you can always appeal. However, it has been my experience that a violation notice appeals rarely work, especially if you are conservative. They just tend to return a basic "you were indeed in violation of TOS" message and then, when you ask for further clarification, they NEVER give one. <br>  <br>  Should the appeal actually work, then your question/account gets restored, and the reporter who made the false report gets a violation notice in turn, and too many false reports will get the report monkey a deleted account. However, the road is long, and very few people pursue it. <br>  <br>  But, there you have it. That's why it's so easy for reporters to get someone else's question or account deleted.|`|U81o09nHaa	I hate it when report monkeys tattle on others unless someone has deliberately insulted them personally.

SZdVYrSSaa	OK, first of all, I know this is long, but I studied Psychology at an ivy league school, and there are a lot of things I can say that may help somehow, even if only one of them works... so first, you need to disregard any chemical thoughts...<br>  <br>  As a guy, there is testosterone in your body naturally which builds up when you are sexually aroused. They release when you orgasm, and often males feel a number of strange things when they are finished with a sexual act because the reserves of testosterone in their body is briefly much lower than it is during normal bodily function. As well serotonin a euphoric chemical that is also often described normally as the "satisfaction steroid" releases into your blood during sex or masturbation, making you feel that warm "glow" or happiness and causing you to stop thinking about your everyday life. There is actually a whole division of psychology dedicated to the idea that the person you are on serotonin is the honest, unclouded you, and they will inject it into the bloodstream and ask the patient questions about their desires, their sexuality, their career, etc. and just get it all out in the open...<br>  <br>  But either way, what is happening when you jerk off is you are chemically blocking anything that would keep you from thinking "stop, I don't want this" and then releasing all of those built up feel good chemicals in one (or as many as seven) bursts. After this happens, over 87% of men, straight, or gay, report feeling sad, lonely, disgusted with themselves, disgusted by their partner, angry, or guilty. And these feelings are caused by a sudden loss in chemicals which cause pleasure, and provide a sense of strength or masculinity. <br>  <br>  If you want to reduce this, you need improve the "walking life" or daily average non-post masturbation mentality about being attracted to the same sex as much or more than the opposite sex. You need to stop thinking about accepting yourself after orgasm, it is a terrible mental state to work within, and is often clouded by these "chemical" thoughts that effect many males.<br>  <br>  Try thinking about it more during the day. When you are walking to a class, or listening to music in your car, don't think about sex with men, think about dating one, taking a guy (no one in particular) to the movies, or bringing him home for a Christmas party, or going to prom together. Think about sharing a meal at a restaurant, or just enjoying time together on a couch somewhere. Things that aren't nessesarily about sex, but are the parts of men you would get from your partner if you were having sex. And try to grip with how very normal that is. Consider how it would make you feel. Consider how the happiness experienced, and the scenes described wouldn't change even if it was a woman. <br>  <br>  Accept that this is normal first. That two men holding hands, are no different than a male and a female holding hands, either way it is a pair of hands, that appear identical in make-up, that are bound together to create warmth and joy, and to show a bond. <br>  <br>  Once this begins to set in, and you start to learn for yourself that it is irrational an silly to think being with a male on a date, or at a dance, is something you should be ashamed of, you will start to have less mental guilt about enjoying them sexually, which will decrease the amount of displeasure you feel after pleasuring yourself, because the more average and acceptable two guys holding hands on a bench looks in your mind, the more average and acceptable two men having sex on screen will become during masturbation.<br>  <br>  Just remember that YOU ARE COMPLETELY FREE. You have already found that you are attracted to the same sex, which is a tough step, and you came here, to a community of LGBT people with a question, which is a tougher step, now you just have to learn that there is nothing harmful, or wrong about these feelings, and you can do that by keeping in mind that you are not different from anyone else, you are simply intelligent enough to understand what makes you happy, regardless of what a lot of archaic ways of thinking may have to say about it... <br>  <br>  Stay happy, learn to consider yourself enlightened to joy, not different, or odd, or guilty. And always, always, always, know that there are whole armies of people behind you, and there is always someone willing to help. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|963d63f6d3d4458368e99dbfe9b34914aa	I used to feel guilty when I was young and first figuring out I was gay.

Eventually, once you realize you can't do anything about it, I finally just stopped hating myself for it, but still never told anyone for a while... after that, it's kinda up to you on what you do.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty about it though... you can't help it, it's not your fault.<br>  <br>  My theory on the WHY, is that you're raised in a society that puts a negative connotation on being gay. People you know and love ALL have different views on it, and it's Taboo, so it's usually an avoided topic. It makes sense that you would feel guilty.<br>  <br>  For example: Lets say you are jewish, and growing up you always noticed that people didn't like jews, and they were treated different because of it, and YOU were jewish... you might feel guilty, or angry about it, because you didn't choose to be jewish.<br>  <br>  That example might suck, but just go with it.<br>  <br>  It's not your fault, so don't beat yourself up about it.

I think you feel guilty because it's not really how you were made. I'm not trying to get down on you for the way you are, but you are meant to have romantic feelings for those of the opposite sex. <br>  <br>  you feel guilty because there is some part of you that knows that it's wrong.

Like in the U.S, you would think that it would be the best example of a democracy. But no, it's actually pretty much a farce based on how much money you can raise. You need to cater to corporate interests (and Obama does too, don't let him fool you) in order to win money and support. <br>  <br>  Corporations also **** things up by making profit the main purpose in life and having little regard for the public welfare, unless it makes money. Then they just celebrate that fact, advertising how they use "natural products" or how McDonalds now boasts it can make chicken nuggets of REAL white meat. Doesn't that say that you didn't do that before and you were making it out of garbage?<br>  <br>  The mass media is controlled by corporations and there is very little diversity in opinion even though it looks like it. Mass media is driven by advertising so the media can't piss off their advertisers with anything resembling criticism of their industry or of capitalism in general. Thus there is a self censorship of media and people are ignorant because of it. <br>  read noam chomsky's "manufacturing dissent". <br>  <br>  And lastly, the U.S. and Wall Street ***** with the whole world, esp developing countries, by driving them into debt with bad loans and terrible investment advice, which in turn allows them to constantly receive interest forever. Read "A Brief History of Neoliberalism" by David Harvey, if interested. <br>  <br>  In the end, it's all about money.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Sin is what is wrong with the world today.|`|W5G9LLenaa	only in certain, countries, (mainly capitalist), people are unwilling to share. they have the, what is mine is mine mentality and sheer selfishness. money also contribute to the hell we all live in.|`|Pb0N71wHaa	Simply put, pious internet surfers.<br>  <br>  Eliminate these jokers and I assure you the world will be much better off for it.|`|8QE30IXkaa	religion

We are all the same in existence with animals and other living animals and plants. When  an animal or a tree dies do you think they will be something else after dead? We humans when we die all I can say is gone, finished, vanished and be forgotten not unless you did something extra-ordinary in your life. Sorry to say all this but it is true, no fairy tale or religious thing will happen to you when you die. Once you got buried underground or cremated you are done and gone. No flying upward to pearly gates nor no going to hell. No religion nor other culture can tell you that a part of you will go somewhere after you die.

sddOpDt7aa	Because some do not want to take the time to see. I am in the same boat,I am not a Wiccan, but a latter day saint. I use to belong to a baptist church before converting. I studied a lot of christian religions/faiths and came up with the bottom line, ALL want to beleive in the bible & Jesus but al lfight over it, so I chose a place I am familiar with,  though I did not have the vision Joseph Smith had, I still had a dream where Jesus visited me! He spoke directly to me where no one witnessed to this event! So who am I to tell who God chooses for his message? In you case, I have met many wonderful Wiccans some christians turned Wiccans, & I know some are very kind hearted  and love the earth & we both believe in God,   but back to your question, some just want to state their own opinion to boost their own egos w/o remembering God gave us freewill & in wicca terms "Do no harm unto others"|`|y9bbLn7qaa	Ive never been called closed mind, I do study what other religions belive because it helps me in defence of my faith.

I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

wB3AbJyLaa	Let's begin by asking ourselves what religion is. Some say it is a form of belief in God. But that would not fit Zen Buddhism, which does not really believe in God at all. Some say it is a belief in the supernatural. But that doesn't fit Hinduism, which doesn't believe in a supernatural realm beyond the material world, but only a spiritual reality within the empirical. What is religion then? It is a set of beliefs that explain what life is all about, who we are, and the most important things that human beings should spend their time doing. For example, some think that this material world is all their is, that we are here by accident and when we die we just rot, and therefore the important thing is to choose to do what makes you happy and not let others impose their beliefs on you. Notice that this is not an explicit, organized religion, it contains a master narrative, an account about the meaning of life along with a recommendation for how to life based on that account of things. Some call this a worldview while others call it a narrative identity. In either case it is a set of faith-assumptions about the nature of things. It is an implicit religion. Everybody needs and has some kind of religion. "What?" you say. "I don't believe in God, I don't have a religion." Well your lack of religion is like your religion. Everyone needs something to believe in. They need something bigger than themselves to be apart of, even if it's a belief in nothing. Our whole life is a search for identity; we're trying to figure out who we are and why we're here. People have come up with lots of different opinions on the matter over the history of mankind, but they're all trying to figure out how this place called earth works.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Religion is simply a set way of doing things in an order in which people involved are able to live with one another without to much chaos and confusion.  Sometimes religion may take a better form leading to common sense for the area in which a group of people may live.  Always take water into the desert and a gun into the forrest.  There will always be a need for religion.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Without religion and the Churches that go with it all the Priests would have to get real jobs.  The current economy couldn't absorb that many new unskilled workers, let alone that many new welfare applicants.  There would also be the problem of justifying Conservative Politics, racial/religious/sexual bigotry and persecution wouldn't work if there was no unquestionable divine authority to which to appeal.  "God said it, I believe it, that settles it" is what let Nazis heard children into ovens, Christians bomb abortion clinics, and Islamists bomb the World Trade Center and feel good about it.|`|UinOWcMUaa	maybe not a religion -- but definitely a personal relationship with God through Jesus  -- I'am the way, the truth and the Life and nobody comes to the Father except through me..<br>  <br>  Of course you could not have a religion but with no Jesus, there is no Heaven... know Jesus and you will know Heaven :) <br>  <br>  Yes we do need a savior.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

To put their problems to a higher power to be solved for them.  So in their cases, it provides peace of mind and a moral background that they feel they must live up to in order to avoid hell.<br>  <br>  As for me, I'm an Atheist and I think the world would be a better place without religion.  Lets face it, religion has caused many deaths through wars, religious persecution, and just outright hate or others.  Also, religion tends to limit the freedoms of many things, from the teaching of knowledge to the advancement in science.  It also infringes upon my legal rights, for example abortion, which wouldn't bother as many people as it does if there weren't the bible, which loosely interpreted says that it is wrong.  So if religion were nonexistent, then many things would be available to me that is not now.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	I don't see a need for a religion in my life, my wife's life, nor my for my children.

And I think the word "need" makes it a challenge. <br>  <br>  For many people, there is no need or desire at all and that's fine. If they are able to build a fulfilling and rewarding, positive life, then they obviously don't need it. God is available to anyone who wants a relationship - with or without religion. And if people believe there is no God, that's their right as well.<br>  <br>  But for me, church offers something that I can't get any place else - the chance to commune with others about and through spirit. I'm not about to sit around at work and engage others in a conversation about God - that's just tacky. And while many of my friends are believers, we're not in the habit of joining together to talk solely about spirit in our lives - we talk about life in general. So for me, praying and talking with others is a great opportunity. <br>  <br>  But that's me. Do i NEED it? No. But I love it.

There is medicine for what you have, but you must take it and take the right amount. Your doc should have started you on meds already so to find the correct dosage for you. That may take awhile.<br>  In the mean time, you should humble yourself and start praying and ask Jesus into your heart to be your personal savior. (and mean it)  Ask Him to clear your mind of these scary thoughts and put into your mind what you should be focused on.<br>  Which is God`s word and what God wants for your life.<br>  Satan likes to put these kinds of thoughts into people and keep them there because he is the father of chaos and confusion. Keeping you away from Jesus is all satan wants to do. Making you confused and<br>  crazy is fun for him. And NO the devil cannot read your thoughts.. Find yourself an American Baptist church that teaches the truth of the bible and attend.  <br>  You are also scard of things you do understand because it is fun to be afraid sometimes.|`|tpDICzslaa	I can't really address your problems in depth on here - its something which you need to talk through face to face and in depth with people you know and trust. I will just restrict myself to one suggestion which may help with the spiritual side of things. <br>  <br>  Throughout history, Christians have regarded the archangel St. Michael as a very powerful help against the work of the devil and against all evil. The Bible tells us that he fights alongside God (Dan 10:21) and that he commands the armies of heaven (Rev 12:7). Thus if you feel threatened by evil then, as well as praying directly to God, also invoke the help of Michael his servant. The following prayer is one which is often used.<br>  <br>  "Saint Michael the Archangel,<br>  defend us in battle.<br>  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.<br>  May God rebuke him, we humbly pray;<br>  and do Thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host -<br>  by the Divine Power of God -<br>  cast into hell, satan and all the evil spirits,<br>  who roam throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls."|`|5shqstYraa	You need to trust in the Almighty, Yehowah, and his son Yehowshuwa|`|jqgxZv0Uaa	you sound schizophrenic. Talk to your parents and get some help. You wont find the answers on here.|`|2f7881b6eca5299515f3da1bd060562daa	For one thing, start asking GOD to help you with what you are asking us. AND start reading the Holy Bible. Start in the New Testament. Read the gospel of John and keep on praying. Go back to church if you can. Years back when I was about 22 I used to be so fearful of dying in my sleep........... it was bad......... But now, as a Christian, Most of my fears have gone. And now I am working on killing some others with God's help of course.|`|8lz3wNn7aa	I have helped a few people who have been in your situation. Even I have had thoughts like that b4. First of all, anything that you focus on constantly will be more a part of your reality(what you put out is what you get back). Now you might be thinking that you will just try to avoid it and suppress the thoughts, but there is a positive way to get this situation under control. Since you seem to be so interested in possession, a good way of going about this is by CHANGING your fear of being possessed? into a Drive to understand what creates the opening for a possession to occur and then an understanding of how to reverse and even prevent it from happening to anyone on the whole planet(or as large scale as you allow yourself to imagine). Since I have also been in a similar mindset as you in the past, I will share what conclusions I have come to. Everyone has a perfect protection against any negative beings. The only way a negative being can go into your environment is if you allow it by somehow acting negative in your life. Situations of being negative would be: long lasting anger towards others or self, overly lustful(using others as a tool to make you feel good), forcing something onto others against their free will, continuous hate towards someone or something, continuous fear of something or someone … and any other . IMPORTANT: any negative emotion, thought and feeling is fine to experience, the thing that makes it lead to a bad situation is if there is no search to find the source or reason or resolution of the circumstance. The Positive things to understand: you are in complete control of everything in your life and there is nothing that can affect you unless you allow it to. Having a mindset of helping others is probably the most efficient way of preventing “negative greetings”. If you are only thinking of yourself and see others as a pawn in your game, this is known as the negative path that will allow “negative greetings” in your life. If you become aware of how situations affect you and others, you are able to choose to have negative or positive reality. This is what I have become aware of, but im not saying that this is the only way of going about with this. There are many of way to look at this and I am happy to share more of my experiences, philosophies, thoughts…etc with you or anyone who has a lot of questions. <br>  I majored in biology and world religions and minored in philosophy. I am very well read in many topics and read about three or more books each week. Even if someone is practicing a religion or even atheist, learning about all/many religions will help you grow in life. If you have a fear of something, the fear can no longer exist if you learn the origins and understand what that thing truly is. Even if you don’t research different religions, it’s good to know that it is scientifically proven that everyone and everything is connected by an underlying energy that is conscious/aware. If you want to understand more of this, then look up on youtube: David wilcock, Gregg Braden and David Wolfe.<br>  If you want to talk with me, you can reach me on Chatango.com and my screen-name is ZenSlice.<br>  Peace Be With You|`|nhZWAt8laa	Hey Serge  <br>        Well I,m not sure where to begin , this is a tough one alright.<br>   So I guess I,d start by acknowledging the legitimacy of your fears       and assuring you that schizophrenia is not the root of your trouble . <br>   Yes possession happens, but it is usually a result of dabbling in wicked activates and things that one has willingly participated in , or in some cases such as sorcery, witch craft or voodoo ETC.- a person may be taken against their own will and drugged , tortured, and brainwashed into such madness that they are subject to possession .<br>    In your case I think that you may simply be obsessing on  this subject to the point that you may begin to brain wash yourself into such a state. <br>     Now about the advise of your psychiatrist, concerning the idea of acting like your possessed in order to get it out of your system , I think that doing this will make you more open and susceptible to possession. In short I think His advise is lousy and terrably dangerous and  that maybe He doesn't truely beleive in possesion, and so doesn't have a clue about how to approach it . <br>    Now I myself am no expert in dealing with it, but I do know Jesus and have studied His word for some time now , and the bible tells us some very spacific things on these matters. For example It say's to avoid all forms of demonism ,that includes even behaving as a possesed person would . And that we should make no allowance for wickedness in our lives, to give satan no opportunity to move through us. The bible say's that we are to rebuke satan when He tempts us .<br>    TRY THIS ... When you find yourself saying thuings like demons are going to come into me , say instead ((Get thee from me satan for I belong to Jesus and you have no part of me !..)). <br>    Jesus said this in  ( John 10:27 ) -My sheep hear my voice , I know them and they follow me. I give them eternal life ,and they shall never parrish. No one can snatch them from my hand.(( No one reffers to satan, demons and evil people, thats Jesus saying to satan YOU CAN'T TOUCH THIS,))<br>    My father who gave them to me is greater then all, no one can snatch them from my hand, I and the Father are the same.<br>     In ( mark:9 ) There is a teaching about A possesed boy . In the story Jesus speaks to the boy's dad and say's all things are possable for him who beleives , the dad say's I do beleive but help my unbeleif. then Jesus cast out the demon and commanded it never to bother the boy again, and later say's that some things only come out with prayer. <br>     The point is to be honest with God about your faith and your unbeleif and He will protect you from wicked influences. <br>      ( John 3:16 ) Say's for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son that whosoever beleives on Him shall not parrish but have everlasting life.<br>    God knows that we in and of ourselves cannot be Perfect and that without His intervention we are doomed to the influences of and the same eternal fate as satan and the demons . So He payed the price that we could not pay to ransom us from our earned fate. <br>      And he made our part alot easier All we have to do is trust Him at His word . Beleive that He is not a liar and that He can't break His promises , And that if He say's that He'll save you then He will do it and live like we mean it . He know's that we're gonna mess up He's not worried about it.  He say's what man has commited a sin so great that God cannot forgive it ? Just trust Him that's all you have to do and He'll deliver you, and nothing of Hell can touch you ( but that doesn't mean that you won't have hard times , Hard times won't end until the second comming when He puts an end to all corruption and takes us to share in His glory forever.   Any way I hope this helps you and that you won't blame God for the problems you've had with peopl in the church , after all we're all people and we all mess up .   I'LL pray for you right now Serge ... and may the peace and blessings of God be upon you   forever..|`|tL4u2Xkoaa	You have to keep your mind stayed own GOD....He will give you perfect peace. The more you think about possession the more the devil has more avenues to attack you. You have the choice to speak life or death it is up to you..and that friend hook back with him/her and go back to the youth group and ask god for some help..I will be praying for you.

KJYVDHEtaa	Mermaids aren't real, but if you really want to know and you believe and try:<br>  <br>  How I did it: I was just pondering over a way to become a mermaid after another failure due to another fake spell :( <br>  But then all these words and ideas came to me.I grabbed a notebook and started to Wright down the entire ritual without thinking. Anyway, I wrote the spell, got everything ready and did it. But the thing is, this is the biggest secret you’ll ever have to keep. You can’t tell anyone you’re a mermaid, at least no one who doesn’t knows about the spell, so it will be safe to discuss your findings with the other mermaids-to-be right here.<br>  <br>  <br>  I will lose my powers soon because I told you about them… but I wanted to share this with the world and it wouldn’t feel right to keep this kind of magic to myself. And I know how badly some of you want this, and I guess some of you might want it more then me.<br>   <br>  And if you do flap out, you will lose your transformational powers forever. <br>  <br>  The color and kind of tail you will have depends on your birth-month and overall personality. (I had an indigo colored one with very fine fins) <br>  <br>  But let's get to the ritual shall we? <br>  <br>  <br>  First there are some things you'll need:  <br>  -a jar (glass)<br>  -a bowl <br>  -small sea shells (you can buy them cheap at decoration shops)<br>  -sparkling water<br>  -a necklace that represents something that has to do with the sea to use as a symbol  (I used one of the shells and made a necklace)<br>  -sea salt <br>  -Two ocean scented candles <br>  -background music that makes you think of the ocean<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   How you do it:First, fill the jar with tap water and mix it with the salt. Then put some of the shells into the water and close it tight. Then fill the bowl with the sparkling water. After that you place the candles in front of you one on your left and the other on your right.Place the sheet of paper in between the candles.  Turn on the music, light the candles, turn off the light, and make your hands all wet with the water from the bowl.<br>  <br>   Take the jar with shells in your right hand and a spare big shell in the other.  Start shaking them and say the spell:<br>  <br>  Guidance spirits come to meMake me what I wish to be Dancing on the ocean floor Dancing with the fish and more But not permanent is my wishI don’t want to become a real fish When I bathe, swim or dreamBless me with a beautiful tailfin Still a human beneath my scalesBut a mermaid deep inside my heart Guidance spirits make me be let me take on the form I wish to be.  <br>  <br>  After you said it correctly close your eyes and your heart will tell you a number… (Mine was 6) That number will tell you how many days it will take for the spell to complete.  <br>  <br>  After hearing the number, open your eyes take a shell and put out the candles using the shell and some water. Stand up, turn on the lights and clean the room.  You have to put the jar on a place where you’ll be able to see it anytime (like on your desk, TV, or nightstand, etc…)<br>  <br>  When you did that you need to eat something salty.<br>  <br>  Shake your jar once every morning and evening. <br>  <br>   you will also have total control over your transformations, as long as you’re in water you can summon your tail.  <br>  <br>  And that’s it; I hope this works for you! Please let me know something if you did it and if it worked or not.<br>  Lessons & tips: you will have to have faith, this spell does not work on the doubdfull or non-believers<br>  <br>  Or try this poem:<br>  <br>  How I did it: <br>  <br>  Moonlight    Moonlight  you  make  me  want  to  scream<br>  Moonlight    Moonlight  you  make  me  want  to  beam<br>  <br>  You   wake  up  at  night  time<br>  You   go  away  at  dawn<br>  <br>  Moonlight  Moonlight  plz  dont  go|`|q2jO0azfaa	got to:<br>  <a href="http://www.spellsofmagic.com/black/56/7/page.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spellsofmagic.com/black/56/7/...</a><br>  7 down the list <br>  good luck and be careful- brokenmricale|`|m1EYoiEPaa	you eat fish every day for a year and then ll turn into one. wat kind of fish I DONT KNOW|`|MPtoz3uCaa	in your dreams hannah..<br>  u can try thinking about being a mermaid very hard before you go to sleep..then, maybe your will dream it..|`|SGz3dxD8aa	myth is on your fifteenth birthday but you cant really turn into a mermaid|`|Pxvl8vuzaa	hmmmm<br>  die.<br>  then youll turn ito a mermaid|`|559cbd9f1767902b6dff2e2c24c12ba5aa	uhhh.. i hate to break it to you but never.. sorry =[ <br>  how old are you?|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	no. i think you can only be born a mermaid.<br>  <br>  but idk keep searching.|`|y3jD0DDpaa	you get bitten by a fish and if you survive the next full moon you turn into a mermaid (sarcasm).|`|JMOLRKRraa	No you are human.

They would certainly not be happy to hear someone in the denomination they started did not think they were a Christian.  With that said---yes, methodists who have accepted Christ as their personal Lord and savior can and do go to heaven.  Does this mean you did not or have not or will not make a decision to make Christ your Lord and Savior?  Then I would pray you would re-think your situation.  If you do not know whether you have accepted Christ, pray about it.  Methodists CAN go to heaven.  Given the above parameters.<br>  <br>  My prayers are with you my friend.<br>  <br>  God Bless America|`|57fZyjvgaa	It doesn't matter what denomination you are... but the fact that you have to ask whether you'll go to heaven is a red flag. If you KNOW Jesus Christ and have a personal relationship with Him, you'll be in heaven no matter what denomination you are... so do you know Him? That's the real question.<br>  <br>  Many "Christians" who go to church every sunday and do good deeds won't be there.... why? they're just going through the actions, and they don't know Him.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Methodists are Christians.

God so loved the World that He gave us His Son...who-so-ever will believe on Him will be Saved for Eternity !  (absolutely no "religions" necessary)...  It's a free gift from God to you !!! (absolutely "no charge") ...the "religions" of the World will have you confused and jumping thru "hoops" and preforming "religious gymnastics" to reach God according to "their" traditions, dogma, rules and regulations, catechisms and spiritual nonsense...  <br>  <br>  God is smart enough to know that "we" have no way of reaching Him...so, He made a "Way" to reach Him...  Read the Book of John, not as a "religious" text but as a Spiritual Book of Righteous information on how to know God and reach Him... Absolutely NO "religion" needed !  (Faith... faith in God !)  Remember, God is NOT a religious "god"...  He is a Righteous and Sovereign God...|`|2RKPtuL9aa	Sure, if Jesus Christ is in your heart. Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:<br>  <br>  Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesus’s sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It's not about having a label.  It's about believing in Jesus alone for salvation.  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|NGpztOIMaa	Methodists are Christians.

See, no one is perfect and no one is good enough to go to heaven.   God, loved us so much he sent his one and only son to die for us, so that when we believe in him, we will not die, but have everlasting life. Ask Jesus to forgive you for your sins and accept his sacrifice for YOU that He made. He loves YOU and He is completely real and alive right now. He knows you by name and knows everything about you. Even though you are not perfect, he loves you anyway. He just wants you to love Him back. That's why he made us. God bless you friend and get a Bible-the New Living Translation is good.

jJDN2Uhpaa	A cholo is the Hispanic equivalent of a gangster. A gangster is someone who is affiliated with a gang, a typically violent association of individuals seeking social acceptance and security at whatever cost. Gang affiliation gives members a sense of belonging they crave and allows them to understand what it means to be an adult in local context.

This selfish ego is the cause for anything negative we see in the world today.<br>  This is how we are born, so it is not actually our fault.<br>  But our task, and our purpose in life is to change this negative quality to a positive one, the quality of unconditional giving, and love.<br>  It happens gradually, provided we follow the specific practical method, which was designed for this purpose.<br>  At the end we reach the level of the Creating force.<br>  This whole process is happening by connecting to our fellow human beings, creating a single, united human creature.<br>  At present our ego is standing in between us.

(Eph 5:26)<br>  <br>  I believes this is the same as baptism that "now saves you -- not not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience--through the resurrection of Jesus Christ."<br>  <br>  I believe this is the same as the baptism that is "in the name (i.e., by the authority of) Jesus Christ unto the remission of sins". (Acts 2:38)<br>  <br>  I believe this is the same as the baptism that Jesus spoke of when he said, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved." (Mark 16:16)<br>  <br>  "Shall be" clearly puts "saved" after belief and baptism.<br>  <br>  "And" joins the verbs "believe" and "is baptized" together.  Basic grammer will tell you that when two verbs are joined together with "and", both must be true for the statement to to be true.<br>  <br>  Some will say that a person believes, is saved, and then he shall be baptized.  That is not the same thing Jesus said.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Man can claim no righteousness as his own. It is God who does the work in baptism. God saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewal of the Holy Spirit. “The washing of regeneration, and renewal of the Holy Spirit” is a reference to baptism. This makes perfect harmony when viewed in light of other scriptures such as John 3:3-5, Acts 2:38, Colossians 2:12, I Peter 3:21, and Romans 6:3-6<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The word "washing" is from the Greek word loutron, which refers to (according to Thayer's Lexicon) the act of bathing and is used here in the New Testament and in other writings to refer to baptism. The word "regeneration" is from the Greek word palingenesia, which is taken from two root words "born" and "again."

ECbyFWLCaa	Not related, but the Muslim preachers will attempt to piggy-back on it, claiming it was about Islam. This is because Islam is a totalitarian religion, so it's followers are offended when something is not about Islam. They go "me me me". You know the type.<br>  <br>  However, you may make a point about it, if you want to:<br>  Saddam was a secular leader, meaning in Iraq, women was allowed to walk outdoors without carrying a tent around them. Kuwait- like Saudi-Arabia - was a lot more fanatic. Bush and his family is buddies of Saudi-Arabia, because of the money, so they helped to crush Saddam. It was a bad move. The world would have been better off with Iraq - and Saddam - taking over the land.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Well, Saddam Hussein attacked Kuwait because he didn't want to repay his country's debt to them. Saudi Arabia got involved because it felt threatened. Islamic extremists became upset that the US had soldiers living in the land most holy to Islam.|`|LF4vun1maa	Islam has probably had very little influence on the current gulf war although the current gulf war has probably had considerable influence on Islam.<br>  <br>  The factors causing this war may involve Christianity but go beyond that.|`|jHWEEZmCaa	the real reason for the war was to protect the jewish masonic state from saddam. since bush was a major masonic leader.<br>  your teacher wouldn't like the truth, so the only clear thing that you may say, is that the presence of christian soldiers in arabia, so close to mecca, upset the wahhabi leader osama ben laden who was an ally to saudi arabia and usa in the war in afghanistan.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	It's nothing to do with Islam,its territorial dispute with Kuwait since Britishers left,ongoing negotiations failed in 1990 ,Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait.Gulf war is UN authorized military action to free Kuwait from Iraq.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	The same way chocolate is related to Pluto being declared a non-planet.

God gifted it to decendents of abhraim. and the Muslims are decendent of Ismail. so i dont know why on the earth are they fighting with muslims (us) to achive the promise land? if you wanna ask more contact me!

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

W9LcpYiKaa	Infant baptism is an initiation of that child into the Church... not only the local, actual church that we attend, but of the "universal" Church. That is a beautiful thing to think about! The Catholic Church is a church that is basically the same all around the world... the same beliefs, the same traditions, the same Lord (maybe just different languages and styles of worship). This child is to be supported and loved and taught by all of its new brothers and sisters in Christ in the church.<br>  <br>  Peter explained what happens at baptism when he said, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).  But he didn't restrict this teaching only to adults. He added, "For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him" (2:39).<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church has always held that Christ's law applies to infants as well as adults. Jesus said that no one can enter heaven unless he has been born again of water and the Holy Spirit (John 3:5). His words can be taken to apply to anyone capable of having a right to his kingdom. He asserted such a right even for children: "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 19:14).|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

(Matt. 19:14). According to the Apostle Paul, one cannot truly come to Christ except through Baptism. (Rom. 6:3-4). Christ must will it because the Apostles baptized ``all the people'' (Luke 3:21 ) and whole households (Acts 16:15, 1 Cor. 1:16). Certainly ``all the people'' and whole ``households'' included infants. Christ must will it because He stated categorically that Baptism is a necessary prerequisite for salvation (John 3:5), and He certainly desires the salvation of infants. He must will it because the primitive Christian Church, which had fresh firsthand knowledge of His Will, baptized infants. In the ancient catacombs of Rome the inscriptions on the tombs of infants make mention of their having been baptized. One such inscription reads: ``Here rests Archillia, a newly-baptized; she was one year and five months old; died February 23rd.'' <br>  An unbaptized infant is not simply in a ``natural'' state; it is in the state of reprobation, living under the reign of Satan, with the sin of Adam ``staining'' its soul. Therefore infants should be baptized as soon as is reasonably possible--usually within 2-3 weeks of birth. When children grow up with Our Lord dwelling in their souls, they have a powerful protection against sin.<br>  God bless.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Here is the best I've ever found. <br>  Sermon 16. Infant Baptism <br>  <a href="http://www.newmanreader.org/works/parochial/volume7/sermon16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmanreader.org/works/paroch...</a><br>  <br>  "Now, for fifteen hundred years there was no dispute or difficulty in answering this question all over the Christian world; none who acknowledged the duty of baptizing at all, but administered the rite to infants, as we do at present. But about three hundred years ago strange opinions were set afloat, and sects arose, doing every thing which had not been done before, and undoing every thing which had been done before, and all this (as they professed) on the principle that it was every one's duty to judge and act for himself; and among these new sects there was one which maintained that Infant Baptism was a mistake, and that, mainly upon this short argument,—that it was nowhere commanded in Scripture. "|`|YupMCYHlaa	I don't think there's anything in the Bible about infant baptism.<br>  <br>  But you know how they say life expectancy in the Middle Ages was 35 years?  That's true but it's misleading.  Infant and child mortality was very high then.  If you made it to 15 years old you had an excellent chance of living into your 60s or 70s, and people that old were not unusual.<br>  <br>  Typically a couple would have five six children hoping to have two or three of them survive to adulthood.<br>  <br>  Imagine how hard it is to lose a child.  (I don't have kids, but I can imagine).  This was a very common thing, part of normal life.<br>  <br>  So people figured, if they couldn't be sure a kid was going to be around long enough to reach an age where they could make the decision for themselves to be baptized, well they would baptize them as babies, as soon as they were born!<br>  <br>  Over the years it got to be a sort of a ceremonial thing.  It gave the new parents a chance to 'present' the baby to their friends and fellow churchgoers, to show the baby off, so to speak.  The baby now became an official member of the church, its name registered in official church records, and included in the nuns' prayers.<br>  <br>  You ask if it's right or wrong.  Well that's a value judgement.  It's not Biblical but so much of what Christians 'know' is not Biblical but traditional.  If it made everyone feel better, what was the harm in it?|`|0fnzDpKXaa	First, why don't you look for places in the Bible where it says not to.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't, by the way.  The Bible commands baptism, period.  It doesn't say anything about age.  And why should it?<br>  <br>  Different branches of Christianity understand baptism differently.  Some say you should reach a certain age because an infant wouldn't have any sins.  But they're talking about ACTUAL sins, not ORIGINAL sin - the two are very different things.  Traditional Christians baptize infants for the remission of ORIGINAL sin.  Baptists and other more conservative branches baptize for the remission of ACTUAL sins.  So neither side is wrong or right, depending on their understanding of it.|`|py57svUyaa	I think it originally simply originated in the fact that not many children ever survived childhood. Out of 16 kids my great great father came from only 3 ever reach adulthood, some died during childhood but most did not make it past 1 year of age. <br>  <br>  Of course it is discussable if a child goes to heaven if it is not baptized but in this case it is a strong Pascal wager. After all, Catholics, which is the main church having infant baptisms have confirmations later in puberty. <br>  <br>  If you ask me, it's just water anyway.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Bible: John the Baptist required that people repent of (abandon) their sins and bring forth good fruits (good works) before he would consent to baptize them.  Obviously, these are beyond the abilities of babies.  Not that babies have any burden of sin on them, you understand.  From the lives of Adam and Eve we can see that sin is imputed only when there is an understanding of good and evil, which is also beyond a baby's faculties.<br>  <br>  If you care, a Book of Mormon prophet called baptism a solemn mockery before God.  He also said that if someone were do die in the middle of thinking that babies have to be baptized to be saved, his soul is in peril because of his lack of charity.  Strong words!  he said that little children are alive in Christ, and that if there were any such thing as original sin, the atonement has covered it, bringing us each back to a fresh start so (like I keep on saying) we can be judged according to our own works.|`|AA10034051	Our children are already partaking in the keeping of God's commandments such as keeping the Sabbath and eating clean.  We are raising them to love and believe in Jesus.  Why shouldn't they also be able to be sealed with his name in baptism? <br>  <br>  Deut. 6: 6&7 <br>  6.  And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: <br>  7.  And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. <br>  <br>  Proverbs 22: 6 <br>  6.  Train up a child in the way he should go:  and when he is old, he will not depart from it. <br>  <br>  Acts 2: 38&39 <br>  38.  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name ofJesus Messiah for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <br>  39.  For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as God shall call. <br>  <br>  I believe, the children of the believers, were included when Peter said, every one of you.  And in verse 39, the promise of God's Spirit is for our children too.  John was filled from the womb and leaped for joy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Baptism is not an option for believers, but a commandment to be obeyed (Matthew 28:19,20). Infant baptism is included in this commandment. It is part of the family covenantal influence which involves the commitment of the parents in bringing up their child in the saving grace of the Lord.<br>  The Old Covenant was entered into through circumcision; the New Covenant is entered into through Baptism: <br>  <br>  Colossians 2:11-12 <br>  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just as children were once circumsized as infants, they are now baptized as infants because the Kingdom of God, which is entered into through Baptism, most certainly includes them: <br>  <br>  Luke 18:16-17 <br>  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. <br>  <br>   Infant baptism just washes away the stain of original sin. When they are older they go thru their confirmation to confirm their beliefs.|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	The idea of infant baptism is related to the mistaken idea that babies are born with the guilt of inherited sin. If a baby is guilty of sin, the thought is that they should be baptized to wash away that sin.<br>  <br>  The Bible however teaches, "sin is the transgression of the law." (1 John 3:4) If a baby is guilty of sin, what law have they transgressed? A baby is not capable of transgressing, or even understanding, any law.<br>  <br>  But, what about inherited sin (guilt)?<br>  <br>  This idea goes against many verses, including Ezekiel 18:20.<br>  <br>  "The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself."<br>  <br>  “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.”  (2 Corinthians 5:10 )<br>  <br>  These verses clearly teach that children do not inherit the guilt of sin, but people will be judged based on their own relationship to God.  We will be judged based on what we have done, not based on what any other person has done, except Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Those who teach infant baptism many times point to the households that were baptized in the New Testament. They assume these households had infants and those young children were included in the baptism.<br>  <br>  This, however is just an assumption. It is risky to base your doctrine on a guess that cannot be proven from the Scriptures!<br>  <br>  In fact, the context of many of these scriptures DISPROVES infant baptism. Notice for example the household of the keeper of the prison in Acts 16.<br>  <br>  He was baptized with his household (verse 33). But notice also, all his household was taught ( verse 32), and they all believed (verse 34). An infant cannot be taught, and an infant cannot believe. Therefore, "household" here does not include any infants.<br>  <br>  In fact, to be baptized one must first believe and repent, therefore, baptism is not for infants. (Mark 16:16, Acts 2:38)<br>  <br>  Notice the eunuch in Acts 8. He asked, "What hinders me from being baptized?” (verse 36) "Then Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may.'" (verse 37)<br>  <br>  A baby cannot believe, therefore a baby would not meet this requirement for one to be baptized.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	Jesus said "believe and be baptized" in order to be baptized you have to know what you are getting yourself into. infant baptism is not biblical. you can not be baptized and then believe. baptism will not save you from hell.|`|303F69Woaa	Baptism is after taking in knowledge, John 17:3, and is the symbolism of your dedication to the doing of God's will and accepting Jesus Christ as your savior. A baby can do neither.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	No its not....I'm about letting the child grow up and choose on its own..|`|PsN79isyaa	To Baptize an infant is to bring comfort to the parents and family/friends - the extended community - in worse case because of DEATH. <br>  Infants die - and people know this - so if your faith states unbaptized people go to hell or limbo - how can this comfort the mother and father...it can't. So by baptizing the child the mother, especially, and father have a chance at less grief. Knowing their baby is in Heaven with Christ.<br>  As there are 7 Sacraments - the most important being Confirmation - when a person at the end of childhood age, and having full knowledge of what they are doing (by completing school/teachings) - accepts their faith, baptism is just a gate to enter through - not full understanding.  <br>  And to get to Confirmation - the child during studies learns to practice Confession, and understands Communion. Steps to being an adult Catholic/Christian.|`|liGEQEz4aa	Do you believe in 1) Keeping the traditions that have been taught, and 2) infant vaccinations?  Here's why I ask these 2 questions.<br>  1) St. Paul does say to stand fast and keep the traditions and the tradition in Christianity has historically been to baptize infants, until very recently, historically, in the Western world.  The fact that the Western world very recently (historically) began to leave out infant baptism doesn't make that the correct practice.  Christ left us the practice He thought was best for our salvation in the Church, and the historical tradition of that Church has always, from the beginning until now, been to baptize infants. Leaving an infant without spiritual protection of the Grace of God is equally ludicrous and damaging to the child.  Do you think that because you cannot see the spiritual influence of the Grace of Baptism, it doesn't exist?  Remember, we are speaking of spiritual life, where for the most part, it's all unseen.  That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. <br>  2) If you belief baptism brings the grace of God, why would you not want that spiritual "protection" for babies, the most vulnerable of our human population.  We're generally smart enough to know we have to make secular decisions for the protection of our children until they are old enough and wise enough to make their own decisions.  Why would we leave out something as important as giving them the protection of the Grace of God.  Maybe we should not vaccinate our children against childhood diseases, but let them decide when they are old enough whether or not they want those vaccines.  After all, they are controversial. Should that be a personal choice of each individual, or should we honor the parents' responsibility to make the best decisions on behalf of their children.  Maybe we shouldn't feed our children, but just wait and let them decide on their own what they want to eat---damned the consequences----they'll be old enough to decide for themselves one day.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Yes, it's right to baptize infants, but if you're a dispensationalist, you won't believe this.  On the other hand, you are stuck with some conundrums if you think it's believe first-then be baptized.<br>  <br>  The "children are never mentioned" argument is a burden-of-proof logical fallacy; but I find it far more significant that they are never denied the rite.<br>  <br>  You asked for biblical support and commentaries.  If you want to see covenant theology, I'd have to throw the whole Bible at you rather than the pages and verses thrown at you with the other answers (you WANT this thrown at you?).   For commentaries, go get your reading glasses, Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, the Westminster Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, plenty of writings & white papers at www.reformed.org, and do some Reformed baptism lookups at sermonaudio.com.  Lutherans & Presbyterians also believe in infant baptism, and of course you already have Catholic beliefs identified here.<br>  <br>  BTW yes, it's dreadfully wrong for Christian parents to not baptized their babies. Some would have you lump dirty, unwashed children of Christian parents with dirty, unwashed children of atheist parents, and call them all saved. Comfortable, easy-believism, why not just re-write the Bible and go with Universalism instead.  Everybody on the Heaven Bus, there is no Hell.  At least Catholics have indulgences...|`|bfWcfCKXaa	I would like the biblical support for the word "Trinity." Or where does it specifically say that Christ was "consubstantial" with the Father or had "two natures" and "two wills" in one "person." Fundamentalist Protestants are willingly to accept all the unbiblical Catholic and Orthodox creeds about Christ when they slice the baloney thin with non-biblical speech. But when it comes to things like infant baptism they want to do the Marla Gibbs routine: "Oh my Stars! Where does it specifically say that in the Bible?" "On my Stars!" Where does it say you can't smoke? Where does it specifically say you can't use pot? "Oh my Stars!" Where does it say as an evangelical minister it is OK to have a mega-Church and make 20 times the salary of the average parishoner, especially when Jesus was poor? "Oh my Stars!"|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	The Bible contains many indications of infant baptism, which is why the vast majority of Christians throughout history have believed and practiced it. <br>  <br>  The Bible contains no explicit command to baptize infants. But then, neither does it expressly prohibit it; nor does it tell us only to baptize adult believers, or those old enough to have made a free decision to believe in Jesus. What we can know and learn from the Bible on this matter is based on indirect indications. Even so, a fairly strong case can be made for infant baptism. Acts 16:15, 16:33, and 1 Corinthians 1:16 all state that ENTIRE households or families were baptized.<br>  <br>  The question then comes down to, "What is a household?" Was it likely to contain children, some of them below the age of reason? In the Biblical worldview (as in a commonsense view), "household" certainly strongly implies the conclusion of children. <br>  <br>  One can find many examples of this. Verses include, but are not limited to, Genesis 18:19, Genesis 36.6, Genesis 47:12, and Matthew 19:29.<br>  <br>  Moreover, the Bible also refers to households becoming Christian believers, or "saved" and teaches that infants are just as much a part of the covenant or Christian community as adults (see Deuteronomy 29:10-12). <br>  <br>  This indicates that salvation is regarded as a communal as well as an individual thing. This is understood by the apostle Paul's elaborate argument comparing baptism to circumcision. Since circumcision was performed on eight-day-old boys, it stands to reason that he baptism would also be performed on very young infants. <br>  <br>  We are all born stained with original sin. The purpose of baptism is to wash away original sin. Therefore, yes, it is wrong to NOT baptize infants! However, even if you are not baptized as an infant and wait until adulthood, baptism has the same purpose. All sins comitted up to that point are washed away, including and especially original sin.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	As a Christian, I'd say follow the example of Jesus.  He was baptized as an adult, even though He was fully aware that His Father was God at age 12 when he was reasoning w/ the elders at the temple. ("Don't you know that I would be about my Father's business?"  He replied when found by His mom.)  Baptism is your symbolic, public display that you identify w/ the death & resurrection of the Messiah.  A baby can not make that informed decision. BUT since people do it as an act of "protecting" the child, it should be known that you can "dedicate" your child to YHWH.  Acknowledge that your baby's true Father is in YHWH and give thanks for the honor of being chosen to raise up the child in the way it should go.|`|jJDN2Uhpaa	I was baptized within months of birth.

It's not Allah's fault they thought they were mature enough to have sex, yet not mature enough to handle getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for you accompanying her, I'm not sure. I mean she's your friend and you feel like she's already in an emotional state, and you not being there will not help. However by going, you are going against everything you believe in. It's like saying that you are completely against drinking alcohol and people who drink alcohol and yet accompanying someone to a bar. <br>  <br>  I think you should tell her that she'd be better of keeping the child, than aborting it. After all, Allah (swt) gave her the child for a reason. So she should take what Allah gave her and if it's too hard for her to look after it, she could give it to someone who can not have children. It's not the child's fault that his/her parents had sex irresponsibly, so why should the child die like that? I suggest you tell her to really think this through. I mean it's not like 'what clothes should I throw out?', but a human being's life on the line.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well for her.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	NO ABORTION!<br>  NOOOOOOOOO...that's murder!<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) will provide when it's best<br>  you're not allowed to terminate another's life for fear of being able to provide b/c Allah(swt) will provide the means required!<br>  <br>  don't support the abortion! try and sit and speak w/her!<br>  it IS their own fault, but insha'Allah if they do the right things instead of keep doing wrong and worse things, life might get better<br>  <br>  have faith!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Ugh.

And, I can definitely assure you that the parents will go insane if they find out their daughter not only had pre-martial sex, but she also had an abortion.<br>  <br>  Please talk her out of it.

6bC1HnyHaa	Praise be to Allaah.<br>  <br>  Firstly: <br>  <br>  There is a difference between permanent adornment which changes the colour or shape of part of the body, and temporary adornment. The former is haraam and is changing the creation of Allaah, and the latter is permissible.  <br>  <br>  Tattooing means changing the colour of the skin, by interesting a needle in the skin until blood flows, then injecting kohl or something else into that place so that the skin takes on a colour other than that which Allaah created. <br>  <br>  Dyeing with henna and the like does not come under this heading. It does not change the colour of the skin, rather it is drawing and decoration and colours that disappear after a while. <br>  <br>  Allaah has permitted women to adorn themselves in this manner on condition that the drawings do not represent animate beings such as humans or animals, and that she does not show this adornment before non-mahram men. <br>  <br>  There are three types of permanent tattoos in general, all of which come under the same ruling, which is that it is haraam. These types are: <br>  <br>  1 – The ancient traditional manner, which is what we mentioned above, where a needle is inserted into the skin and blood is made to flow, then the place is filled with kohl or some other dye. <br>  <br>  Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>  <br>  Waashimah refers to the one who does tattoos (washm), which means inserting a needle or the like in the back of the hand, wrist or lip, or elsewhere on the woman’s body until the blood flows, then that place is filled with kohl and it turns blue. That may be done with circles and decorations, and it may be a lot or a little. The woman who does this is called waashimah and the one to whom it is done is called mawshoomah, and if she asks for that to be done she is called mustawshimah. This is haraam for the one who does it and the one to whom it is done by her choice and at her request. End quote. <br>  <br>  Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim (14/106). <br>  <br>  For the evidence and the comments of the scholars on this issue please see the answer to question no. 2119. <br>  <br>  2 – Using chemicals or doing a surgical procedure to change the colour of the entire skin or part of it.  <br>  <br>  Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: <br>  <br>  Some people – especially women – use some chemical substances and natural herbs to change the colour of the skin, so that after using these chemicals and natural herbs for a while, dark skin becomes white and so on. Are there any shar’i reservations concerning this? Please note that some husbands order their wives to use these chemicals or herbs on the basis that the wife has to adorn herself for her husband. <br>  <br>  He replied: <br>  <br>  If this change is permanent then it is haraam and is a major sin, because it is a worse change in the creation of Allaah than tattooing. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who does hair extensions and the woman who has that done, and the woman who does tattoos and the woman who has them done. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: May Allaah curse the women who do tattoos and the women who have them done, and the women who pluck eyebrows and the women who have that done, and the women who file their teeth for the purpose of beautification, those who change the creation of Allaah. And he said: Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed? <br>  <br>  The one who does hair extensions means the one who has short hair, and she adds something to it, whether it is hair or something that resembles hair. <br>  <br>  The one who asks for hair extensions to be done is the one who asks for that to be added to her hair. <br>  <br>  The woman who does tattoos is the one who puts the tattoo on the skin by inserting a needle and the like, then fills that place with kohl or something similar which changes the colour of the skin.  <br>  <br>  The woman who asks for tattoos to be done is the one who asks someone to do a tattoo for her. <br>  <br>  The woman who plucks eyebrows means the one who plucks hair from the face, from the eyebrows or elsewhere, for herself or for someone else. <br>  <br>  The woman who asks for that to be done is the one who asks for her eyebrows to be plucked. <br>  <br>  The woman who files her teeth is the one who asks someone to file her teeth so as to widen the gaps between them. All of these things are changing the creation of Allaah. <br>  <br>  What is mentioned in the question is worse in terms of changing the creation of Allaah than that which is mentioned in the hadeeth. End quote. <br>  <br>  Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (17/ answer to question no. 4). <br>  <br>  See the answer to question no. 2895 for more information on this topic. <br>  <br>  3 – Temporary tattoos which may last for up to a year. <br>  <br>  Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: <br>  <br>  Recently there has appeared a new way of using kohl and outlining the lips by using a temporary tattoo which lasts for six months or a year, instead of using regular kohl and lip outliner pencils. What is the ruling on that? <br>  <br>  He replied: <br>  <br>  That is not permissible because it comes under the heading of tattooing, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who does tattoos and the woman who asks for that to be done. This outlining of the lips and eyes remains for a year or half a year, then it is done again when it fades and remains for a similar length of time, so it is similar to the tattooing that is haraam. <br>  <br>  The basic principle is that kohl is a remedy for the eyes, and its colour is black or grey; it is applied to the lashes and eyelids when there is a disorder in the eye, or in order to protect the eye from disease, and it may be a beauty and adornment for women, as a permissible kind of adornment. As for outlining the lips with a temporary tattoo, I think that it is not permissible, and women should keep away from doubtful matters.  <br>  <br>  And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon Muhammad and his family and companions. End quote from a fatwa on which is his signature. <br>  <br>  Secondly: <br>  <br>  What we think with regard to temporary tattoos is that they come under the same ruling as dyeing with henna, if they are done in the manner mentioned in the question and not in the way that is forbidden. This permissibility is subject to several conditions: <br>  <br>  1-     That the drawing should be temporary and will disappear, and not permanent<br>  <br>  2-     She should not put any drawings of animate beings<br>  <br>  3-     She should not appear with that adornment before non-mahram men<br>  <br>  4-     Those colours and dyes should not be harmful to the skin<br>  <br>  5-     There should be no resemblance to immoral or kaafir women<br>  <br>  6-     She should not put any drawings of symbols that venerate deviant religions, corrupt beliefs or misguided ways<br>  <br>  7-     If it is done by someone else, it should be another woman and it should not be put on any place that is ‘awrah. <br>  <br>  If these conditions are met, we do not see any reason why she should not adorn herself with it. <br>  <br>  Al-San’aani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: <br>  <br>  Some ahaadeeth give the reason for tattooing being haraam as being because it is changing the creation of Allaah, but it is not said that dyeing with henna and the like comes under this heading, and even if it does come under this heading, it is exempted according to scholarly consensus and because it happened at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  <br>  <br>  Subul al-Salaam (1/150). <br>  <br>  Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: <br>  <br>  It has become common among people – especially women – to use some chemicals and natural herbs that change the colour of the skin … we have quoted the question above. <br>  <br>  He replied: <br>  <br>  What is mentioned in the question is worse in terms of changing the creation of Allaah that that which is mentioned in the hadeeth.  <br>  <br>  But if the change is not permanent, such as henna and the like, there is nothing wrong with it, because it will disappear, so it is like kohl, blusher and lipstick. What must be avoided is that which changes the creation of Allaah and this warning should be spread among the ummah so that the evil will not spread and become difficult to change. End quote. <br>  <br>  Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (17/answer to question no. 4). <br>  <br>  We have quoted the Shaykh as saying in his fatwa that it is permissible so long as the drawings do not include images of animate beings. See the answer to question no. 8904. <br>  <br>  Some doctors have warned about the medical harm that is caused by these temporary tattoos. <br>  <br>  It says in the Saudi newspaper al-Yawm: <br>  <br>  Temporary tattoos are increasingly popular among girls of various ages, especially on Eids and during school holidays. <br>  <br>  Dr Usaamah Baghdadi, a specialist in skin diseases, has warned against getting carried away with these stickers which lead to disfigurement of the body and lead to many skin diseases in accordance with the amount of glue that is used, which may pass through the skin and enter the bloodstream, and the chemicals used for colouring also have a negative effect on overall health. End quote. <br>  <br>  Issue no. 11,159, thirty-ninth year, Saturday 11/11/1424 AH -- 3/1/2004 CE. <br>  <br>  If it is proven that this method is harmful and that it leads to skin diseases or other kinds of sickness, then it is forbidden according to sharee’ah, because the Muslim may not do anything that will harm himself or others. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ibn Majaah (784); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel. <br>  <br>  And Allaah knows best.<br>  Islam Q&A|`|UOB6Wo61aa	If it's haram,it's a strict nonsense.|`|rgGhtmnPaa	tatoo is not allowed in islam|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim<br>  <br>  Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br>  <br>  I just wanted to add the note that, while it is true that getting a tattoo is not permitted in Islam, if one has a tattoo, this is not a barrier to becoming a Muslim, as sins that one committed before becoming Muslim are all wiped out.  So if someone has a tattoo, or many tattoos, and wishes to become Muslim, there is nothing standing in the way of his doing so.  And Allah knows best.<br>  <br>  Fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid

6W4ZWOetaa	To expand on this some:<br>  <br>  Being Wiccan does not have anything to do with "powers".  Wicca is a religion/spiritual path like Christianity or Judaism is.  <br>  <br>  We are generally (although there are several variations...) worshippers of both masculine and feminine deity and we revere and worship the balances of nature, and usually promote acceptance of all people and other living things.<br>  <br>  Being a witch like Harry Potter is a fun fantasy idea, but that's just it.  It's a fantasy.  Wiccans are not like Harry Potter.<br>  <br>  If you really want to study Wicca you start studying it like any other religion.  Read books, talk to people who are wiccan.  Go to meetups.  <br>  <br>  A good book that I recommend to start with is Raymond Buckland's book "The Complete Guide to Witchcraft," or "Wicca for the Solitary Practitioner" by Scott Cunningham.<br>  <br>  You might also read "A Witches Bible" by Janet and Stuart Farrar.<br>  <br>  Movies like The Craft are absolutely not accurate.  <br>  <br>  Most of us wiccans are deeply spiritual, devoted, and accepting of other religions.  All paths lead up the same mountain.|`|AA11579058	1)  You know if you are a Wiccan if you chose at some point to be a Wiccan and you have studied enough of it to know what it means beyond simply a label.<br>  <br>  2)  You almost definitely do not have the kind of "powers" inferred by your question as said "powers" do not exist.  You will never be able to levitate yourself or other objects, you cannot produce magical light, you cannot transmogrify anything, neither curses nor hexes have any affect, nor do blessings and spells.  You cannot talk to animals, go out of your body or summon supernatural beings that do not exist.|`|AA11374522	Wicca is a religion. Like most other religions, you know you're a Wiccan when you believe in the concepts and have made a concious choice to become a Wiccan. Wiccans don't have "powers." We are not Willow, the charmed ones, or the girls from The Craft.|`|7b56875ec783eb5fc0c599bfcdfd5ce5aa	If you believe in the wiccan religion then you are wiccan and if you do not then you are not wiccan.

Whether it be to a pantheon or culture, or to the occult in general. But Wicca =/= witchcraft. You can have Wiccan witches, but not all witches are Wiccan, and not all Wiccans are witches. <br>  As for powers... that depends on what you define as powers. If you're waiting to turn into Harry Potter, you'll be waiting a while. Witches can't fly, can't shoot things out of their hands or wands, and they can't freeze time or anything like that. Our power is subtle, in comparison to hollywood type magick. <br>  Best bet for you is to read up on it, and find out.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	If you don't know if you're a Wiccan, clearly you're not.  Wicca is a religion.  It's something you either accept or your don't.  It's something you either believe in or you don't.  <br>  <br>  Wiccans do not have powers.  Wiccans are not born.

NwXnzARwaa	Some men display more homophobic attitudes when repressing homosexual urges that they are either unaware of or deny, and/or are overcompensating for an insecurity about their own masculinity.<br>  <br>  A University of Georgia study has shown that psychoanalytic theory holds that homophobia - the fear, anxiety, anger, discomfort and aversion that some ostensibly heterosexual people hold for gay individuals - is the result of repressed homosexual urges that the person is either unaware of or denies. A study appearing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, published by the American Psychological Association (APA), provides new empirical evidence that is consistent with that theory.<br>  <br>  A Cornell University study has shown that when men are more insecure about their masculinity, they display more homophobic attitudes. Masculine overcompensation explains some attitudes like animosity to homosexuals.|`|E71jweytaa	you sound very redneckaphobic why do you FEAR them|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	I think people are homophobic from what their upbringing is, meaning their parents influenced their values, whether they are correct or not and we are taught not to question our parents for the most part. Also, it may be due to a bad experience of being hit on by someone who was gay, even after explaining that they are not interested. Some people assume that if someone is gay they are attracted to every member of the same sex. The worst I ever heard was a friend of mine who was gay, he got a job at a daycare and someone he thought was his friend made a statement about a gay guy working with children, insinuating that all gay men are pedophiles or something, I was perplexed by this. Especially since most same-sex fancying pedophiles are married to the opposite sex.|`|88vcImqiaa	You mean why do some people not accept the "anythings goes" attitude that homosexuals have.

wB3AbJyLaa	Now, it's true that he did create the potential for evil to enter the world, because that was the only way to create the potential for authentic love. But it was human beings, with our free choice, who brought that potential into reality. But if God is God, couldn't he have known what would happen? Couldn't he have anticipated the consequences of giving people free choice? No doubt he did, but let me ask you a question: when you start a relationship, whether it's a friendship or a relationship that might possibly lead to falling in love, can you foresee the possibility that the other person may sometime disappoint you or hurt you or even walk away from you completely? So why do you ever make friends or start relationships? I guess it's worth the risk. Having good friends, and all the wonderful things about being in love, that more than makes up the risk of getting hurt. I think it's the same with God. He knew we'd rebel against him, but he also knew many people would choose to follow him. It must be worth it to him, because he not only created us with free choice, but he even created the way to bring us back to him after we rebel, through the suffering of his Son Jesus. Even if God didn't cause suffering in the first place, why doesn't he put a stop to it now? The fact that God deliberately allows certain things, which if we allowed them would turn us into monsters, doesn't necessarily count against God. If I said to my brother,"I could bail you out of a problem but I won't," I would probably be irresponsible and perhaps wicked. But we do that all the time. We don't do their homework for them. We don't put a bubble around them and protect them from every little hurt. I remember when my younger sister was trying to thread a needle in Brownies. It was very difficult for her. Every time she tried, she hit herself in the finger and a couple of times she bled. I was watching her, but I said to myself, "She can do it." After about five minutes she finally did it. After I came out of hiding my father walked into the room and she said, "Daddy, Daddy. Look what I did!" She was so proud she had threaded the needle that she had forgotten all about the pain. That time pain was good for her. Now, certainly God is much wiser than one of us. So it's at least possible that God is wise enough to foresee that we need pain for reasons which we may not understand but which he foresees as being necessary to some eventual good. Therefore he's not being evil by allowing that pain to exist. Imagine you're walking in the woods and came across a bear with his leg in a trap. You want to help him, but he thinks you're out to get him, so he fight you every time you get close. Finally, you shoot him with a tranquilizer gun. Now he really thinks you're out to hurt him. Then you get his leg out of the trap, you first have to push it deeper into the trap to release the tension on the spring. If the bear were semiconscious, he would be even more convinced you were out to hurt him. But he would be wrong. He can see the situation from his limited perspective, so he wonders, "Why are you making me suffer?" Now, how can you be sure it's not like that with us and God? I believe God does the same to us sometimes, and we can't understand why he does it any more than a bear could understand what you are doing. As a bear could have trusted you, so we can trust in God. Ask champion athletes whether they simply floated to the top of their sport or whether instead their training involved teeth-gritting sacrifice and suffering. They'll tell you, "No pain, no gain." They probably wouldn't go so far as to say the pain was good in itself, but something good definitely result form it. Just a grueling workout helps an athlete build stamina and strength, difficult life experiences can shape a person's character to make him or her a winner in some other way. The Bible describes it like this: "We rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope" Romans 5:3. I saw a real-life example of that guy in his mid-twenties named Craig. Craig really knows how to reach out to help hurting teenagers. He mentioned that the best preparation he had for his work was going through his own broken engagement. Do you think that was suffering for him? If you've ever experienced a broken relationship, you know it was. Do you think he rejoiced in it? Not at the time, I'm sure. But can you imagine going through a breakup yourself and wanting someone to talk to about it? Who would you rather talk to: someone who has never felt that pain or someone who knows just what you're going through? If you could ask Craig whether God can use painful experiences to strengthen him, he would say God can.|`|ODTe2l77aa	Stupid Theist Answer- So they can learn from it.<br>  Funny Atheist Answer- Because he's a sick, sadistic asshole.<br>  Real Answer- God doesn't exist.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	He really doesn't have any choice, because he's in a book and suffering is in the real world.<br>  <br>  This is a bit like asking why spider-man allows people to get mugged.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	Simply because the human race asked Him to "leave us alone".

We suffer because we are being tested in fire--problems (but why?) so that we become strong like refined gold.  Do you recall the message about the gold in the fire?  well before becomes pure it has to endure high heat so that the impurities burn up and float to the top where these are removed and so I see our suffering as that--God is putting us through the fire to make our spiritual man to become strong to resist the devil ( how come?) so that when the devil comes to tempt us (you know our weakness----anything that pretty much makes us lose control--fall into temptation; tpically sexual thoughts or feelings).  So we have to suffer to become stronger in our faith.  :D|`|WomRzhxPaa	Why does not God prevent cruelties in the world?<br>  <br>  Sri Sathya Sai Baba:<br>  God is only a witness (saakshibhoota). He does not act. Man acts according to the dictates of his intellect (buddhi) and himself suffers the consequences of his actions (karma). There is neither good nor bad for God. Take the knife as an example. A murderer uses a knife to kill another man, a slaughterer uses a knife to slay animals, a surgeon uses a knife to amputate, and a cook uses a knife to chop vegetables. If a magnet is placed among all these knives, it will attract them all equally and not according to the kind of tasks they perform. God is like this magnet. All knives are the same to Him. However, the hands that wield the knives have to bear the consequences of their actions, dependent on right and wrong.|`|UITfm0fjaa	The Bible's explanation is that Satan wants to prove a point, and God is allowing him to test whether or not he is a fit ruler.

A sick person speaks sickness, thinks sickness, and acts sick. A wealthy man thinks prosperously, speaks prosperously, and acts prosperous.<br>       God says that we reap what we sow.

He poured out his wrath on His own son instead of on us so that we can follow the example that Jesus left and so that we can one day join Him in Heaven.  the fact that He would even want any to do with us is beyond me.  <br>  We have to give thanks in all situations good and bad because God IS good and apart from Him there is NO good.  so we cant just expect everything to always be perfectly fine and nothing to go wrong because it wasnt even like that for Jesus Christ; the Son of God.  He had to face persecution, He had to face rejection, He had to face God's wrath, and He had to face death.  and all for us.  but He stayed true and faithful to God even after all the suffering He went through and now He's sitting at the right hand of God.  and know that God will NEVER put us through something that we cant handle, and as long as we follow the instructions God has given us (The Bible), theres nothing to worry about.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	There is no "logical" explanation for why God does things.

qEdhPD8Laa	Wikipedia defines a counter-culture as a subculture whose values and norms of behavior run counter to those of the social mainstream and expresses the ethos, aspirations, and dreams of a specific population during an era.<br>  <br>  I don't think the vampire subculture falls into this definition, because it doesn't meet the 2nd half of this definition.<br>  <br>  The Goth subculture, from which the vampire subculture emerged, could be said to be a counter-culture, because it expresses a more consistent style of aesthetic self-expression. Some self-professed vampires express a similar dark aesthetic, but many appear mainstream or are part of other subcultures, such as Neo-Pagan. I think there's too much diversity within the vampire subculture to label it a counter-culture. It also doesn't seek to change the mainstream culture, like the 1960's counter-culture did.<br>  <br>  The vampire subculture started to become visable to the mainstream culture in the 1990's. After bad press following the disappearance of reporter Susan Walsh and the murders by Rod Ferrel of his girlfriend's parents, some members of the subculture decided to counter with more positive media attention. Since then, more self-professed vampires have wanted to change the way they're perceived by the mainstream culture. They want to be more accpeted, but this isn't the same as wanting to change mainstream culture in other ways.<br>  <br>  These videos show the changing face of the vampire subculture.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxbtnyblTTI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxbtnyblT...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEjPPo4c_fA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEjPPo4c_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItnwxYw7T8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cItnwxYw7...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lnZWd4GJxI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lnZWd4GJ...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaaZus3PRHw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaaZus3PR...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYuT528fqvU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYuT528fq...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEzVU7zdQ74" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEzVU7zdQ...</a><br>  <br>  - P.|`|jLL7sDILaa	Subculture.

But in case you don't buy that, surely you know what St. Paul preaches in the Acts about fornication.  St. Paul is very clear that fornication is not for Christians, and all other sins are not committed with the body, but fornication dishonors the temple of the Holy Spirit.   In the historic Christian Church, there is Canon Law that forbids marriage between 2 people who've committed carnal acts together before marriage, because we are to marry a spiritual helpmate, and if our intended helpmate can't keep us from that fall, but falls into it as well, that person will not make a good spiritual helpmate.  The role of helpmate in spiritual terms is someone who can help us overcome our sinful weakness.  If both people fall to the same temptation, they will not be able to help each other through life struggle against each other's individual weakness.  In other words, if you really want to marry this person, keep your relationship pure.  Even if you leave out the question of a spiritual helpmate able to help you resist temptation, a carnal start on a marriage erodes trust.  Marriage is hard enough without the erosion of basic trust.|`|GrCj35muaa	you can look up the following, I found these in the Concordance of my Parallel Study Bible:<br>  <br>  Fornication: <br>  John 8:41<br>  Rev 14:8<br>  <br>  Fornicator:<br>  Eph 5:5<br>  Heb 12:16<br>  <br>  Fornicators:<br>  Heb 13:4<br>  <br>  Good Luck and you could always start considering marriage.|`|hNbNPFe3aa	there is no such verse...fornication comes from the greek word Pornia, which basically means "sex for money, or sex just for the sake of having sex." it's like the gluttony of lust.|`|0ba214520befec37e3ad7fa148b28bc7aa	<a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/sex-before-marriage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotquestions.org/sex-before-m...</a>

They would want us to be happy, and know that they are in a better place, removed from the pain and conflict we experience.  The dead are at peace, if they have kept the commandments while on earth, and done all that they knew was right, and have had their ordinances performed.  But I am sure it distresses them to see their living loved ones unhappy.<br>  <br>  I am aware of a young man who was killed in an accident, who came back as a spirit to tell his mother that his father was excessively grieving.

UO3i8BqVaa	I wonder if you meant "Knights Templar".<br>  I think you may be 700 years too late.<br>  <br>  "Modern Templar organizations<br>  By papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred to the Order of Hospitallers, which also absorbed many of the Templars' members. In effect, the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders.[61]<br>  <br>  The story of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars, especially their persecution and sudden dissolution, has been a tempting source for many other groups which have used alleged connections with the Templars as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery. [62] Since at least the 1700s the York Rite of Freemasonry has incorporated some Templar symbols and rituals,[4] and has a modern degree called "the Order of the Temple". The Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, founded in 1804, has achieved United Nations NGO status as a charitable organization.[63] There is no clear historical link between the Knights Templar, which were dismantled in the 1300s, and any of these other organizations, of which the earliest emerged in the 1700s.

AA11440601	Patrick was recognized as a saint well before the Catholic and Orthodox Churches split in 1054 so he would be recognized by both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<br>  <br>  Saint Patrick was born about 385 in Scotland. His parents, Calpurnius and Conchessa, were Catholic Romans living in Britain in charge of the colonies.  This might even make Saint Patrick an Italian.<br>  <br>  At the age of fourteen, raiders captured Patrick and took him as a slave to Ireland, a land of Druids and pagans. Patrick learned the Irish language and customs. <br>  <br>  While a slave, Patrick's faith in God grew and he wrote <br>  <br>  "The love of God and his fear grew in me more and more, as did the faith, and my soul was raised, so that, in a single day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers and in the night, nearly the same." "I prayed in the woods and on the mountain, even before dawn. I felt no hurt from the snow or ice or rain." <br>  <br>  When Patrick was twenty, he had a dream in which God told him to leave Ireland by going to the coast. He escaped and found a boat that took him back to Britain and his family.<br>  <br>  Later Patrick dreamed that Irish were calling, "We beg you, holy youth, to come and walk among us once more." <br>  <br>  Patrick studied, became a priest, and, later, a bishop. In 433, he went to take the Gospel to Ireland. <br>  <br>  Patrick preached the Gospel throughout Ireland, converted thousands, and began building churches.<br>  <br>  Patrick is famous for using the shamrock (a three-leaf clover) to explain the Trinity.<br>  <br>  Patrick preached for 40 years and died on March 17, 461 at Saul, where he had built the first church. <br>  <br>  Patrick's feast day is March 17 and he is the patron saint of Ireland.<br>  <br>  For more information, see: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11554a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11554a.h...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|E71jweytaa	as a saint yes<br>  <br>  protestants think we worship him, though we do not|`|yQNit56Qaa	No.  The Eastern Orthodox churches also recognizes his sainthood, and I suspect that the Anglican Church and several other early Protestant churches also recognize his sainthood.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|U81o09nHaa	Traditionally, yes, he's a Catholic saint.

pzY0ARqDaa	Step 1: Study the subject. Read everything you can on ghost sightings, spirits, orbs and apparitions to get an idea of what these phenomena are and how ghost hunters go about investigating them. <br>  <br>  Step 2: Join a local ghost hunting group. The best way to become a ghost hunter is to just get out there and do it. Check out the Ghosts and Hauntings website or the Ghostvillage website for information on groups in your area. Contact these groups (who you gonna call?) to see how you can go about becoming a new member. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Consider taking a class. While formal training isn't required to become a ghost hunter, the information that can be gleamed from an organized class with a knowledgeable instructor is invaluable. Several organizations, such as Flamel College and the International Ghost Hunters Society, offer online courses that you can complete at your own pace and in your own time. <br>  <br>  Step 4: Buy some ghost hunting equipment. If you don't have these already, invest in a digital camera, a notebook and pens, a tape recorder and a flashlight. As you gain knowledge and experience, you may also want to consider purchasing an EMF detector–a device commonly used by ghost hunters to detect disturbances in electric and magnetic fields. <br>  <br>  Step 5: Start hunting. Research local sites that are rumored to be haunted or where ghostly activity has been witnessed or recorded. Use the techniques you learned from your fellow ghost hunters or from your own studies to conduct an investigation. Be sure to record your findings for the benefit of other ghost hunters.|`|eXzUJbQJaa	Well firstly the most important thing of Alll is to have some Ghost to hunt, if u do actually find some, run back to ur pc and tell me all about it (i am actually being serious not sarcastic) and then i can tell the doctors to increase ur medication (no this last part is a joke by the way) <br>  <br>  the second thing u need is a magical net, or even a pet ghost-hunting dragon would be a must have...|`|RW566BSUaa	well you need your <br>  <br>  magical crossbow<br>  enchanted sword<br>  pixie dust<br>  and your vampire juice <br>  and your unicorn blood<br>  and your ONE WAY TICKET TO THE MENTAL HOSPITAL|`|GmEdWFPEaa	Can you help me out here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/aut5v3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/aut5v3</a><br>  <br>  You would be helping yourself out as well b/c it is reallly fun and addicting.

Even worse it is linked to cancers.<br>  <br>  Cannabis users display neuropsychological dysfunction (relative frontal lobe functioning deficits, cognitive inhibition) and attentional deficits similar to those found in schizotypal or schizophrenia patients. <br>  <br>  Regular use can shrink the parts of the brain which control memory, emotion and aggression. The hippocampus, which is thought to govern emotion and memory averages 12 percent smaller and the amygdala, which has a part in controlling fear and aggression, 7 percent  smaller.  This suggests that heavy daily use may be toxic to human brain tissue.<br>  <br>  Blood flow velocity is significantly higher in users and they have higher values on the pulsatility index (PI), which measures the amount of resistance to blood flow. This is thought to be due to narrowing of the blood vessels that occurs when the circulation system's ability to regulate itself is impaired.  This leads to abnormalities in the small blood vessels in the brain.<br>  <br>  The active chemical in MJ called delta-9-tetrahyrdocannabinol (THC) binds to cannabinoid (CB) receptors located on several cell types in various organs.  This greatly increases the risk for heart attacks and strokes in addition to impaired learning and memory.<br>  <br>  It can also effect physical health.  Three to four cannabis cigarettes a day cause the same amount of damage to the lungs as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day. Thus there are rising levels of lung diseases such as emphysema.<br>  In comparison to cigarettes marijuana smoke has significantly higher levels of toxic compounds, including ammonia and hydrogen cyanide.    Ammonia levels are 20 times higher while hydrogen cyanide, nitric oxide and certain aromatic amines occurred at levels 3-5 times higher.<br>  It can also effect the unborn child. Scientists have identified that endogenous cannabinoids, molecules naturally produced by our brains are functionally similar to THC from cannabis and play significant roles in establishing how certain nerve cells connect to each other.  Maternal cannabis use allows THC to travel through the placenta and impair fetal brain development and impose life-long cognitive, social, and motor deficits in affected offspring.<br>  <br>  Low doses of ?-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), equivalent to that in the bloodstream of an average marijuana smoker facilitate infection of skin cells and can cause these cells to turn into malignant sarcoma.  Men who regularly smoke cannabis have a 70 per cent increased risk of testicular cancer.<br>  <br>  <br>  And then there are all the car crashes caused by people driving under the influence of drugs that are at this moment being quantified but already show that more drug drivers kill than drink drivers!!|`|GGLh6nqYaa	The rastafarians mon|`|dcDY9pJeaa	some modern religions in america have gov't protection for peyote

As far back as 1950 in his encyclical of 1950, the Humani Generis, paragraph 36, Pope Pius XII declared that there was no conflict between belief in evolution as it applies to the body as long as you recognize the Divine origin of the soul.  Pope John Paul II reiterated the same point in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences of Oct 23, 1996.  In both cases they point out that since God is the author of both scripture and nature His truth can be found in the study of both, and if we seem to see a conflict it must be a problem of our understanding since Gods Truth cannot contradict itself.  That is a Catholic Principle going back centuries.

RarSAK4Haa	you are a scorpio. with a leo rising. Leo rising people cannot help but be noticed. They radiate a special energy and magnetism that gets others' attention. Sometimes it's because they are loud people who pay a lot of attention to their personal appearance (especially their hair!); other times it's due to a regal manner that simply demands interest from others.<br>  The tendency to overestimate things, and themselves, is generally present. This is due to a natural enthusiasm and optimism about any new undertaking. Sometimes, they are walking commercials. In fact, Leo rising people make excellent promoters. <br>  you need to watch out for a guy named Alex or Andrew.

6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Actually i don't celebrate it - but i can see why some Christians do.<br>  I like the answers from those who are for celebrating Lent. <br>  <br>  I might just give something up this Lent - thanks for bringing it to my attention.<br>  <br>  God bless Cyclops   -   enjoy that chocolate and beer lol  : )<br>  ~~~<br>  <br>  nondenominational Christian|`|8e940602f9b9bd6fa756f54788682a7aaa	You're right, there's nothing in the Bible about Lent; but, many practicing Christians observe this 40 day period before Easter as a time of meditation and study of Christ and the gift of everlasting life. It's a tradition that many of us look forward to-(I know, sounds strange) but it does make the Mardi Gras, Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday more significant.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Here is the meaning of Lent. Lent is an old English word meaning 'lengthen'. Lent is observed in spring, when the days begin to get longer.<br>  Now, here is why Christians have lent.....lengthy but worth it<br>  <br>  Lent is the period of forty days which comes before Easter in the Christian calendar. Beginning on Ash Wednesday, Lent is a season of reflection and preparation before the celebrations of Easter. By observing the forty days of Lent, Christians replicate Jesus Christ's sacrifice and withdrawal into the desert for forty days. Lent is marked by fasting, both from food and festivities.<br>  <br>  Whereas Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus after his death on the cross, Lent recalls the events leading up to and including Jesus' crucifixion by Rome. This is believed to have taken place in Roman occupied Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  The Christian churches that observe Lent in the 21st century (and not all do significantly) use it as a time for prayer and penance. Only a small number of people today fast for the whole of Lent, although some maintain the practice on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. It is more common these days for believers to surrender a particular vice such as favourite foods or smoking. Whatever the sacrifice it is a reflection of Jesus' deprivation in the wilderness and a test of self-discipline.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	The idea of Lent comes from the time Jesus spent in the desert (40 days and 40 nights.) Catholics often choose to "give something up" for Lent to simulate some of the suffering and sacrifice Jesus gave in the desert. (and the temptation he endured) You can do whatever you want, but leave everyone else alone.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Like the old saying..  "If you eye offends thee, cut it off", meaning, if there is 'something' hindering your 'walk' with God, then get rid of it!

It was stared by the early church|`|AA11923447	Not every spiritual discipline practiced by Christians has to be mentioned in the Bible. I'm not a Sola Scriptura Christian, nor does my church teach Biblical literalism. Lent is not as much a matter of legalism (although it can be turned into that by a shallow mind) as it is an intensive focus upon spiritual renewal. There's nothing wrong with taking 40 days to reflect upon Christ. If you don't observe Lent, that's fine. But many Christians do, and reap positive spiritual benefits from doing so.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	I don't either

2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	Evidently, he was transferred through earth’s atmosphere and placed on a different part of the globe. This is shown by the fact that Elisha does not hold any period of mourning for his master. A number of years after his ascension in the windstorm Elijah is still alive and active as a prophet, this time to the king of Judah. Because of the wicked course taken by King Jehoram of Judah, Elijah writes him a letter expressing Jehovah’s condemnation, which is fulfilled shortly thereafter.—2Ch 21:12-15; That Elijah did not ascend to the spiritual abode of Jehovah God was later confirmed by Jesus Christ, who declared: “No man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man,” that is, Jesus himself. (John 3:13) The way to heavenly life was first opened up to imperfect humans after the death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.—John 14:2, 3; Hebrews 9:24; 10:19, 20.<br>  Transfiguration,<br>  Jesus himself called what took place a “vision” (Mt 17:9), but not a mere illusion. Christ was actually there, though Moses and Elijah, who were dead, were not literally present. They were represented in vision.|`|LAJGAAMcaa	I don't think that the prophet Elijah's being taken up to heaven has anything to do with where the OT patriarchs where after death.

qtXsNipdaa	The tabernacle also shows the different levels of relationship we can have with God.  The outer court, the inner court, and the Holy of Holies.  Those that don't really want to spend time with Him remain in the outer court.  Those that spend time with Him are in the inner court.  Those that maintain a deep level in their walk and have an intimate relationship with Him can be brought into the Holy of Holies.<br>  <br>  We do wedding ceremonies using the tabernacle as similitude.  We start with the Brazen Alter and the couple kneels and prayers.  We have the Laver that washes away the past and washes away sin.  We have the candlestick, which is also the unity candle.  The individual self that we extinguish and the joining of the two becoming one. We have the Shewbread, which is communion (drink/bread).  We sometimes have the alter of incense, which represents His presence.

That is why they would tie some sort of rope around one of their ankles, so they could be pulled out if they did not survive.<br>  It's also a picture of sorts of how we should enter into worship,  as they did.

nzdDdKtyaa	You won't have to get rid of your wives, for you are already married to them---the Bible speaks against marrying under certain circumstance(mainly not to marry someone of a different faith) but if you are already married, even to 3 women, that is not a reason for divorce.<br>  <br>  The Bible itself never specifies that men and women HAVE TO practice monogamy--that's just the culture of most Christian nations.  While some may interpret it that way, I see many historical Bible figures having multiple wives with no negative tone to it.<br>  <br>  That being said, each individual marriage is between one man and one woman--but that doesn't mean it is sinful for a single man to have multiple marriages with multiple wives.<br>  <br>  The one time that I know of that the Bible speaks of monogamy is when in 1 Timothy 3:2 when it says that a member of the church leadership(such as pastors and deacons) should be "a husband of one wife." This is clearly to allow the man to focus on his church duties-a man with one wife can focus on their duties to the church more than a man with several.<br>  <br>  The Bible never commands a person to divorce their spouse under any circumstances(other than unfaithfulness), and I doubt any Christian would encourage it as well.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	dont join any church until you read the book of mormon. <br>  <br>  the mormons faced this problem too. some moved out of the country, some were allowed to continue their practice but the church has told its members other council on this matter <br>  <br>  i have no problem with you having 3 wives. the u.s government does, even though they allow adultery and fornication and many plural divorces.(truly this country is a country of infidels) if you have 3 wives where you are than it should matter if you are not in the U.S. just continue having them!|`|dF5clN4daa	God calls a person to repentance.

Jesus told us to love our neighbor. To me, "neighbor" includes everyone. Friends, family, co-workers, enemies, everyone. Loving your neighbors (in this case, your family members) doesn't include kicking them to the curb. And not all Christians are opposed to multiple and/or polygamous marriages. Many are, but I do have Christian friends who have multiple spouses.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Christianity says nothing on the subject of plural marriages unless you are seeking an office in the church such as Deacon or Bishop. Considering that changing your deen could mean risking your life and that of your family it's a big step. Be safe.
98db9265e124fe3bdd587062c20209e2aa	I first learned to Astral Project when I was in my teens. I got a book called "Journey's out of the body" by Robert Munroe. It was a great read and gave a simple exercise for having an OOBE. Youcan find the book on Amazon for a few cents and I'd recommend you get it.I tried the method and was successful although it was hard to regularly repeat the exercise. Years later(thanks to the internet) I was doing some research about Astral projection and found out that Robert Monroe was involved with a company called Hemisync, an organization in America doing research into altered states of conciousness. Hemisync is still around today, but a spinoff was born called Holosync (I'm sure you've heard of them).<br>  <br>  Both Hemisync and Holosync provide products which enable you to experience altered states with ease by using a process called brainwave entrainment. Brainwave entrainment enables you to alter your level of conciousness by listening to slightly differing tones through headphones. The audio stimuli then aligns the brains frequency to the frequency being played. This is called a frequency following response and is documented through scientific research.<br>  <br>  I found that by using this technology I could meditate with ease and astral project whenever I wanted. You really need to try it, it's so easy to do.<br>  <br>  The only thing about this amazing technology is that it carries a rather expensive price tag, but there are other alternatives which use the same technology and are at a fraction of the price. Moonfish Design have the Astral Inducer software which costs a few dollars and can be ordered from their website. The software is easy to use and has a very high success rate.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend that you visit the sites listed below and decide for yourself. If you truly want to have an OOBE then the sites below have the answers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	You have to be VERY relaxed for that to happen. For a beginner, the easiest way to practice is right before you fall asleep since that's when you're most relaxed. Right before you go to sleep, keep silently repeating the affirmation to yourself "I am going to have an out of body experience tonight". You can actually use any affirmation you'd feel most comfortable with. Once you reach the hypnagogic state, the state between being awake and falling asleep, your brain will be a LOT more receptive to these affirmations and they will carry over into your sleep. Don't expect it to happen the first time although it might. It takes a lot of consistent practice to have an OBE at will. I've had plenty of accidental ones but I haven't had a conscious one yet because I'm too lazy to keep up with the practices. Don't be like me though. Put in the work and you'll get the results.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Lie in bed and make sure it is very dark.

FGcwxZz0aa	There is a common Protestant misunderstanding of purgatory. At least one protestant minister, John Wesley, spoke of perfectionism in this life, possible but rare. He is one of the few to proclaim that one can be sanctified in this life and he left the Moravian Church over this issue after a rebuke by Count Zinzendorf for this teaching. <br>  <br>  People in purgatory are already justified by receiving the supernatural eternal life into our souls through Baptism making us a part of the Body of Christ. Those in purgatory have accepted Christ by faith and have not rejected Him by unrepentant mortal sin. It is a place where one is purified by fire (Mal 3:2). Imagine the joy of being in purgatory and knowing that you are there because you have passed judgment and are assured of being in the presence of God in heaven. Purgatory is not an eternal destination, there are only two, heaven or hell.<br>  <br>  We should not think of purgatory as some kind of legal punishment for past sins as it would be under the old law. Those in purgatory are already new creatures changed by Christ’s grace, they are the adopted children and part of God’s family in purgatory one receives final discipline and cleansing preparing one for the perfection of heaven. Catholics believe that sanctification is a process and is not completed when one comes to belief. So purgatory is not a suggestion that Christ’s atonement is insufficient but that we have not yet completed our sanctification through the grace of Christ. <br>  <br>  Cleansing or sanctification is a gradual process and we must endure to the end to be saved.<br>  <br>  (Mat 10:22 DRB) And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake: but he that shall persevere unto the end, he shall be saved.<br>  <br>  (Mat 24:13 DRB) But he that shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved.<br>  <br>  (Mar 13:13 DRB) And you shall be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he that shall endure unto the end, he shall be saved.<br>  <br>  Catholic soteriology recognizes that for some of us the process was not completed at death or that we died with unrepentant sin.<br>  <br>  (Heb 9:27 DRB) And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:<br>  <br>  The judgment is our eternal destiny and for those whose name is in the Lamb’s Book of Life, heaven is assured. But we know that one must be free of sin to be in God’s presence.<br>  <br>  (1Ti 6:14 DRB) That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>  <br>  It may be that one is not prepared to be in our Lord’s presence as we may still be with spiritual shortcomings or temporal effects of forgiven sins on our soul making it necessary for some form of purification to enter heaven in God’s presence. Since this is a process of purgation it is called purgatory and it is in keeping with prophecy of the prophet Habakkuk who said that only that which is holy may enter heaven.<br>  <br>  (Hab 1:13 DRB) Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things, and holdest thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than himself?<br>  <br>  St. Paul also taught of a process of purgation which may involve suffering on the soul of Christians and in his first letter to the Corinthian Church he describes the process of purgation after death.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:10 DRB) According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation: and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:11 DRB) For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:12 DRB) Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:13 DRB) Every man's work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:14 DRB) If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:15 DRB) If any mans work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.<br>  <br>  St. Paul speaks metaphorically that the results of sin that remain on one’s soul is like “wood, hay and straw” and are burned away in the process of final purification to be received in the presence of the Lord. St. Paul also speaks of one’s works as “gold, silver and precious stones” which are refined and retained.<br>  <br>  This passage reminds me of what Christ said in the following indicating that some sins may be forgiven after death.<br>  <br>  (Mat 12:32 DRB) And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come.<br>  <br>  Purgatory is also related to the parable of the unforgiving servant which is as follows…<br>  <br>  Mat 18:32 DRB) Then his lord called him: and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me:<br>  <br>  (Mat 18:33 DRB) Shouldst not thou then have had compassion also on thy fellow servant, even as I had compassion on thee?<br>  <br>  (Mat 18:34 DRB) And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he paid all the debt.<br>  <br>  After telling the parable Christ emphasizes His message lest it be misunderstood with this warning……..<br>  <br>  (Mat 18:35 DRB) So also shall my heavenly Father do to you, if you forgive not every one his brother from your hearts.<br>  <br>  Christ was warning us of the danger of a hard heart or anger making us unwilling to forgive others. We should acknowledge that these are the signs and example of a defective soul in need of purgation so that he that is imperfect may be in the presence of God and dwell in glory. (See CCC 1030-1032) <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	Unlike the common misconception, purgatory is NOT a place in between heaven and hell; nor is it a place of torment. Purgatory is a place where already saved souls go for cleansing of the stain of any sin before the enter the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  A more appropriate question would be, "Where do fundamentalists get the idea that it's perfectly OK for a soul in a state of sin to be in the presence of the Lord?"|`|IwlE0oFbaa	The idea of Purgatory as the above answers show comes from scriptures which implies the people have always practiced this.  <br>  <br>  Here is where you can see the free Catholic Bible if you wish to see some of the above verses for yourself:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/inde...</a><br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  <br>  The four last things are Death, Judgement, Heaven & Hell.  Purgatory is a state of the heavenbound.<br>  <br>  Democracy can be a good way of government if the government officials are not corrupt; the same for monarchies.  Catholics believe Christ is the true king.<br>  <br>  Because some men abused the practice of praying for the dead doesn't make all prayers for the dead evil.  I can go to any Church and ask a priest to schedule the intention for a Mass for $5 or $10 and only one such stipend may be taken per Mass.  <br>  <br>  I may also pray from my home for the deceased as I will as my cousin's son died last week at age 24.  If anyone wishes, you may offer a prayer for James Gutting.  I may also visit any cemetery and pray for the dead.  Catholics believe they know of our prayers and pray themselves for our good to God as intercessors.<br>  <br>  Here is how Gregory the Great explained purgatory:<br>  <br>  "608 St. Gregory the Great, Dial. 4, 39: PL 77, 396; cf. Mt 12:31. <br>  CITED TEXT:<br>  <br>  St. Gregory the Great, Dialogues 4, 39 <br>  <br>  In the Gospel our Lord says, 'Finish your journey while you still have the light.' (John 12:35) And in the words of the Prophet He declares, 'In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in the day of salvation I have helped thee.' (Isaiah 49:8) St. Paul's comment on this is: 'And here is the time of pardon; the day of salvation has come already.' (2 Cor 6:2) Solomon, too, says, 'Anything you can turn your hand to, do with what power you have; for there will be no work, nor reason, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the nether world where you are going.' (Eccl 9:10) And David adds, 'For his mercy endures forever.' (Ps 117:1) From these quotations it is clear that each one will be presented to the Judge exactly as he was when he departed this life. Yet, there must be a cleansing fire before judgment, because of some minor faults that may remain to be purged away. Does not Christ, the Truth, say that if anyone blasphemes against the Holy Spirit he shall not be forgiven 'either in this world or in the world to come'? (Mt 12:32) From this statement we learn that some sins can be forgiven in this world and some in the world to come. For, if forgiveness is refused for a particular sin, we conclude logically that it is granted for others. This must apply, as I said, to slight transgressions, such as persistent idle talking, immoderate laughter, or blame in the care of property, which can scarcely be administered without fault even by those who know the faults to be avoided, or errors due to ignorance in matters of no great importance. All these faults are troublesome for the soul after death if they are not forgiven while one is still alive. For, when St. Paul says that Christ is the foundation, he adds: 'But on this foundation different men will build in gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, or straw . . . and fire will test the quality of each man's workmanship. He will receive a reward, if the building he had added on stands firm! if it is burnt up, he will be the loser; and yet he himself will be saved, though only as men are saved by passing through fire.' (1 Cor 3:12-15) <br>  <br>  Although this may be taken to signify the fire of suffering we experience in this life, it may also refer to the cleansing fire of the world to come, and, if one accepts it in this sense, one must weigh St. Paul's words carefully. When he says that men are saved by passing through fire, he is not referring to men who build on this foundation in iron, bronze, or lead, that is, in mortal sins which are indestructible by fire. He specifies those who build on this foundation in wood, grass, and straw, that is, in venial or trivial sins which fire consumes easily. In this connection we should also remember that in the world to come no one will be cleansed even of the slightest faults, unless he has merited such a cleansing through good works performed in this life. <br>  <br>  Matthew 12:31 <br>  <br>  Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven."<br>  <br>  That comes from a footnote reference from the Catechism of the Catholic Church here:|`|AA11796124	Here's a sample:<br>  <br>  Purification After Death By Fire<br>  Heb. 12:29 - God is a consuming fire (of love in heaven, of purgation in purgatory, or of suffering and damnation in hell).<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:10-15 - works are judged after death and tested by fire. Some works are lost, but the person is still saved. Paul is referring to the state of purgation called purgatory. The venial sins (bad works) that were committed are burned up after death, but the person is still brought to salvation. This state after death cannot be heaven (no one with venial sins is present) or hell (there is no forgiveness and salvation). <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:15 – “if any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.” The phrase for "suffer loss" in the Greek is "zemiothesetai." The root word is "zemioo" which also refers to punishment. The construction “zemiothesetai” is used in Ex. 21:22 and Prov. 19:19 which refers to punishment (from the Hebrew “anash” meaning “punish” or “penalty”). Hence, this verse proves that there is an expiation of temporal punishment after our death, but the person is still saved. This cannot mean heaven (there is no punishment in heaven) and this cannot mean hell (the possibility of expiation no longer exists and the person is not saved). <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:15 – further, Paul writes “he himself will be saved, "but only" (or “yet so”) as through fire.” “He will be saved” in the Greek is “sothesetai” (which means eternal salvation). The phrase "but only" (or “yet so”) in the Greek is "houtos" which means "in the same manner." This means that man is both eternally rewarded and eternally saved in the same manner by fire. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:13 - when Paul writes about God revealing the quality of each man's work by fire and purifying him, this purification relates to his sins (not just his good works). Protestants, in attempting to disprove the reality of purgatory, argue that Paul was only writing about rewarding good works, and not punishing sins (because punishing and purifying a man from sins would be admitting that there is a purgatory). <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 3:17 - but this verse proves that the purgation after death deals with punishing sin. That is, destroying God's temple is a bad work, which is a mortal sin, which leads to death. 1 Cor. 3:14,15,17 - purgatory thus reveals the state of righteousness (v.14), state of venial sin (v.15) and the state of mortal sin (v.17), all of which are judged after death. <br>  <br>  1 Peter 1:6-7 - Peter refers to this purgatorial fire to test the fruits of our faith. <br>  <br>  Jude 1:23 - the people who are saved are being snatched out of the fire. People are already saved if they are in heaven, and there is no possibility of salvation if they are in hell. These people are being led to heaven from purgatory. <br>  <br>  Rev. 3:18-19 - Jesus refers to this fire as what refines into gold those He loves if they repent of their sins. This is in the context of after death because Jesus, speaking from heaven, awards the white garment of salvation after the purgation of fire (both after death). <br>  <br>  Dan 12:10 - Daniel refers to this refining by saying many shall purify themselves, make themselves white and be refined. <br>  <br>  Wis. 3:5-6 - the dead are disciplined and tested by fire to receive their heavenly reward. This is the fire of purgatory. <br>  <br>  Sirach 2:5 - for gold is tested in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. <br>  <br>  Zech. 13:8-9 - God says 2/3 shall perish, and 1/3 shall be left alive, put into the fire, and refined like silver and tested like gold. The ones that perish go to hell, and there is no need for refinement in heaven, so those being refined are in purgatory. <br>  <br>  Mal. 3:2-3 - also refers to God's purification of the righteous at their death.|`|AA10034051	First, a definition is in order: what is Purgatory?<br>  <br>  Purgatory is not Hell minus a few torments and degrees Fahrenheit; it's not Heaven minus joy. It's not a "Third Final Destination" of souls. Purgatory is simply the place where already saved souls are cleansed of the temporal effects of sin before they are allowed to see the holy face of Almighty God. Revelation 21:27 tells us that "...nothing unclean will enter [Heaven]." <br>  <br>  <br>  Daniel 12:2, Matthew 12:32, 1 Corinthians 3:13-15, 2 Timothy 1:16-18, Hebrews 12:14, Hebrews 12:22-23, 1 Peter 4:6 and Revelation 21:10, 27 all speak of Purgatory in their telling of the need for purification, prayers for the dead, Christ's preaching to the dead, or how nothing unclean will see God. <br>  <br>  prayers for the dead (Tobit 12:12; 2 Maccabees 12:39-45), <br>  <br>  Purgatory (Wisdom 3:1-7), <br>  <br>  intercession of dead saints (2 Maccabees 15:14),<br>  <br>  <br>  and intercession of angels as intermediaries (Tobit 12:12-15).<br>  <br>  Even the The Talmud speaks of Purgatory: <br>  <br>  Sabbath 33b: <br>  "The judgment of the wicked in purgatory is twelve months." <br>  Rosh HaShanah 16b-17a: <br>  "It has been taught that the school of Shammai says: "There will be three groups on Judgment Day (yom haDin):<br>  <br>  <br>  The completely righteous will be recorded and sealed at once for eternal life. The completely wicked will be recorded and doomed at once to Gehinnom, as it says: "And many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall rise up, some to eternal life and some to shame and eternal rejection" [Daniel 12:2]. Those in between will go down to Gehinnom and cry out and rise up, as it says: "And I will bring the third part through the fire and refine them as silver is refined and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name and I will answer them" [Zechariah 13:9]<br>  <br>  <br>  Rabbi Shammai (50 BC - AD 30), one of the two main teachers of early rabbinical Judaism, also is on record as having interpreted Zechariah 13:9 as referring to a state of purification after death. Isaiah 66:15-16 and Malachi 3:2-3 were also interpreted in rabbinic literature as referring to the purgatorial process, and the same theme is reflected in Wisdom 3:1-7 and II Maccabees 12:43-45, both contained in the Deuterocanonical<br>  <br>  That there are temporal effects of sin is obvious when one considers that even those who have been baptized, who have a deep and intimate relationshp with Jesus, who are the "elect" or "the saved/being saved," or what have you, are subject to pain, work, death and sickness.<br>  <br>  The best way to understand the idea of already being forgiven but still having to be cleansed of the temporal effects of sin is by analogy: imagine you are the parent of a 7-year old child who steals a candy bar from the local grocery. The child is repentant, in tears, sobbing his apologies. You, being the good parent (as God, our Father is!) forgive that child and love him and show him your mercy. But being a good parent means that you are also just and will expect that child to pay back the store. Purgatory is God's way of forgiving us, loving us, showing us His mercy and justice -- and making us "pay back the store." Can you imagine what would happen to the child of a parent who never expected that child to "pay back the store" (especially when that same parent believed also that there was nothing that child could do to become "disinherited," as in the "once saved, always saved" doctrine)? <br>  <br>  Purgatory is His way of ensuring that Revelation 21:27 is true and that nothing unclean will see Heaven. It is only through Christ's sacrifice that we are shown this mercy! It is Christ and Christ alone Who allows us access to the Father.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	There are different levels of purgatory. People who showed much mercy to the souls in purgatory while on earth, are shown much mercy by God when they are in purgatory. This can be through lessened sufferings or through shortened duration of their purgatory.<br>  <br>  Some people suffer much in purgatory. Some are severely tormented by fire. Some are forced to wear flaming handcuffs. Others suffer poverty, living in shacks in horrible weather conditions. Others suffer painful ulcers of the mouth for committing sins of speech. Many saints have written that one moment in purgatory is so horrible that it seems to last for many, many years.<br>  <br>  Mary, St. Joseph and St. Michael often come to visit purgatory. They bring comfort to those who were devoted to them during life.<br>  <br>  People in purgatory can be helped by the prayers of those on earth. The most efficacious prayer for helping the souls in purgatory is the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. The Rosary and devotion to the Holy Wounds are also very effective.<br>  <br>  Many souls in purgatory suffer for a long period of time because they have no one to pray for them. Mary has told us in her apparitions that the average length of a person's purgatory is 30 to 40 years. She has also told us that most people go to purgatory, the second most go to hell, and very few go straight to heaven.<br>  <br>  People in purgatory suffer with periodic consolations. They are occasionally shown visions of heaven. Those in purgatory suffer willingly and for love of God. Unlike hell, in purgatory there is no despair.<br>  <br>  To avoid purgatory, I recommend propagating the Devotion to the Seven Sorrows of Mary. See promise #7 below:<br>  <br>  The Seven Sorrows of Mary are as follow:<br>  <br>  1. The Prophecy of Simeon<br>  2. The Flight into Egypt<br>  3. The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple<br>  4. Mary Meets Jesus as He Carries His Cross<br>  5. The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus<br>  6. The Body of Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross and Placed into Mary's Arms<br>  7. Jesus is Placed in the Tomb.<br>  <br>  Mary wishes for us to pray one Hail Mary while meditating on each of the Seven Sorrows, for a total of seven Hail Marys. She has made the following promises to those who do this on a daily basis:<br>  <br>  1. I will grant peace to their families.<br>  2.They will be enlightened about the Divine mysteries.<br>  3. I will console them in their pains and I will accompany them in their work.<br>  4. I will give them as much as they ask for as long as it does not oppose the adorable will of my Divine Son or the sanctification of their souls.<br>  5. I will defend them in their spiritual battles with the infernal enemy and I will protect them at every instant of their lives.<br>  6. I will visibly help them at the moment of their death, they will see the face of their Mother.<br>  7. I have obtained this Grace from my Divine Son, that those who propagate this devotion to my tears and dolors, will be taken directly from this earthly life to eternal happiness since all their sins will be forgiven and my Son and I will be their eternal consolation and joy.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	try these <br>   rev.21:27<br>   heb.12:14<br>   1 cor. 3:15<br>   1 peter 1:7<br>   2 macc.12:42,46<br>   matt 12:32|`|ptIIkqq0aa	You ave received some very nice answers to your question!|`|oaEqLAT7aa	Here is your Bible verses... al least the few I learned in school, there is more I haven't learned yet<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:27 nothing imperfect enters Heaven<br>  <br>  So what do you think this saying...

Some are eternally united with God in Heaven, often envisioned as a paradise of eternal joy. Conversely, others are destined for Hell, a state of eternal separation from God often envisioned as a fiery place of punishment.<br>  <br>  In addition to accepting the states of heaven and hell, Roman Catholicism envisages a third state before being admitted to heaven. According to Roman Catholic doctrine, some souls are not sufficiently free from sin and its consequences to enter the state of heaven immediately, nor are they so sinful as to be destined for hell either. Such souls, ultimately destined to be united with God in heaven, must first endure purgatory—a state of purification. In purgatory, souls "achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."<br>  <br>  Roman Catholics make a distinction between two types of sin. Mortal sin is a "grave violation of God's law" that "turns man away from God", and if it is not redeemed by repentance and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell.<br>  <br>  In contrast, venial sin (meaning "forgivable" sin) "does not set us in direct opposition to the will and friendship of God" and, although still "constituting a moral disorder", does not deprive the sinner of friendship with God, and consequently the eternal happiness of heaven.<br>  <br>  According to Roman Catholicism, pardon of sins and purification can occur during life—for example, in the Sacrament of Baptism and the Sacrament of Penance. However, if this purification is not achieved in life, venial sins can still be purified after death. The specific name given to this purification of sin after death is "purgatory".|`|wVet0QXVaa	It's based on the Jewish and biblical idea of Gehenna.  According to what I've read, most Jewish people believe that Gehenna is a place where the soul goes to be punnished of purified for a period of up to 12 months.  (Catholics do not speculate on time period.)  Sheol (hell) is considered to be a seperate place.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this is part of the tradition that Christ would have been aware of.  That's not to say that our understanding of it is perfect, but there is Scriptural and Traditional evidence that it exists.<br>  <br>  This is an example of the Jewish beliefs on Gehenna.
