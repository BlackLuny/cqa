Also, since (I assume) the Endometriosis and adhesions were treated during her surgery, this should reduce pelvic inflammation, help any distortions caused by the adhesions, and overall improve her chances of pregnancy.  If, given her age (35+ = trying for up to 6 mons.; under 35 = trying for up to a year), she is not able to conceive within the "rule of thumb" timeframe, it is time to see a reproductive endocrinologist or other fertility specialist.<br>  <br>  Endometriosis will always come back if not meticulously and totally removed during surgery.  Superficial laser vaporization, fulguration, cauterization, ablation, etc. does not adequately treat the disease; it simply partially removes it from some locations temporarily.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both, and for you specifically, check out <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mendomen">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mendomen</a><br>  (Men Who Love Women with Endo, for men only).|`|J9oQ8dCYaa	The doctor will tell you this.

They say there is little that can be done to change fertility with this.  They are  not even sure why it causes infertility,  but not everyone with endometriosis is infertile.   It's  a hard thing all I can say is be there for her, tell her that your life will be just as happy with out children even though you want them to.  My husband got me a puppy which was really sweet and helped a lot.  The most important thing is that your there for one another.  Good luck|`|8011ff35e903e16d01eee5f83530baddaa	endometriosis is when you have too many hormones released and the uterine lining grows too fast and clogs up the fallopian tubes. it can also grow out of the tubes and into the abdomen which is what causes all of the pain. if she still has one ovary and tube connecting to the uterus she should still be able to get pregnant. the surgery i have heard of for endometriosis is to remove the excess tissue. women diagnosed with endometrosis are usually put on hormone therapy to alleviate this. it will be more difficult to conceive but it should def. be possible|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Endometriosis will likely decrease your chances of conceiving naturally especially with the removal of an ovary and tube. Hopefully, she still has one functioning ovary. Just ask her doctor the degree of severity of the endo on that ovary. Just so you know, having endo doesn't put your wife or the baby at risk once she becomes pregnant. Actually, being pregnant will stop the progression of the endo and she will be without any symptoms of endo during her entire pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I also have endo, severe and agressive. I had the surgery and unfortunately my pain started up again, just as bad, after only six weeks.  My doc wanted to remove my right ovary but I wouldn't let him. My husband and I tried to conceive for over three years. Even after the surgery my doc recommended that we try immediately to get pregnant. We continued without any help for 6 months. After no success, we finally tried IVF.|`|g1nj93ytaa	Obviously you want to help your wife.. I suggest you got to www.endocenter.org .

If Daddy even tries to pick her up she throws the hugest screaming kicking fit!    Funny story though about my 33 month old son.  He can tell a boy from a girl now when we are out, and he said a couple weeks ago that he is a boy and Abigail (his sister) is a girl.  So I asked what Mommy was, and he says "A big woman person" and so then I asked about Daddy, expecting a similar response.  Instead he says "Daddy is a big guy who does all the dishes!" I laughed for a long time over that! I guess he sees that as Daddy's role for some reason! haha    EDIT: Daddy obviously isn't the only one who does the dishes.  It is so funny to see how kids see things though!  We actually do everything 50/50, including dishes, laundry, bathing the kids, feeding the kids, potty breaks (both kids are potty trained!  before that we shared diaper duty), etc.  But my son was the same way my daughter is in the night, but with my husband! He had to have my husband from birth to 2 years old in the middle of the night, but was fine with us both during the day.  My daughter has been like that with me since birth; she will be 2 in 3 months, be curious to see what happens!|`|aEmdURPTaa	It all depends on how you raise your child, and your habits as parents.    I breastfeed and my baby decided to refuse the milk that I pump into bottles.  So, yeah, my child did associate me with milk and will not let my husband feed her.  However, we both play with her, give her her bath, put her to bed, dress her, change her, read her stories, wear her in a baby sling, etc.  So for the rest, our daughter accepts both of us for most roles.  It's easier for us that way, and she'll develop a deep attachment to both of us for most things.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	The roles arent really defined with us, as in my hubby also occasionally spoonfeeds our baby, changes nappies and sometimes gets her dressed etc.  He's the one she always laughs with though, maybe she thinks he's funny, he's good at making up silly games.  I'm the only one that can give her her milk though, so she comes to me for that, and consequently she's gotten used to me being the one to put her to bed and tend to her at night, so i'm now the only one she allows to do that.  My hubby also reads her bedtime stories but then i have to go up after to tuck her in or she wont go to sleep.  She's 9 months old, maybe a little young for your question but i thought i'd answer anyway
umGzyElZaa	He will probably want to do a c-section just for the baby's safety! My friend had the same problem!  Just so you know though... c-sections are not as bad as everyone on here says...Trust me I asked my share of ?'s on here when I found out I had to have one and EVERYONE scared me to death!  My Dr told me (my pubic arch is too narrow to deliver naturally...I had contractions 4-10 mins apt for 3 days and it did nothing, they didnt hurt at all though so it wasnt as bad as it sounds) that when you have a situations like these having a c-section is of course a higher risk for you, but very low for the baby! And its the opposite for a vaginal birth...ONLY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE...its higher for the baby and less for you. Thats when you have to say "Ok, its worth it for the baby's health!"   I was walking the very next day...walked up my stairs when I got home with no problem...took care of my son...and was back to normal in about a week! The worst part is getting out of the bed at home...and not having a hospital bed to push yourself up with. I loved my c-section! Its how it had to be done...and it was quick, easy, the safest option at the time, and you can hardly see my scar!  I pray though that your baby turns and this wont be necessary! BUT I just wanted to let you know how EASY c-sections are and not to be nervous just in case!!! Good luck and congrats!! :o)|`|MtC3CWZraa	It's up to your doc. Nothing says your child can't get back into the proper position in the next 2-3 weeks. You should ask your OB how (s)he deals with such events.     When my baby's position was a concern, my doc said if she wasn't head down by 38 weeks, he'd schedule us for a c-section at 39. Yours may have a different set of standards, (s)he uses though.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	There are some ways doctors can TRY to turn the baby (I've heard this can be very painful), there are certain stretches, yoga poses, etc that can help baby turn.  I would google about the poses, I've heard those can be very effective.  A friend of mine had a transverse baby and she used some kind of poses to help turn him, I'll see if I can find that website and I'll post it for you.  If none of that works, then it will most likely be a c-section.  Don't worry, some babies turn right before delivery.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	You may have to have a c-section.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	You might be able to get your baby to move in the head first position again,otherwise they might do a c section|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	If you want to try to get your baby's head down before birth you could try leaning over the back of the sofa or kneeling on the sofa and hanging your arms over the back.This lets gravity pull your bump down which can sometimes encourages the baby to move to a head-down position. Obstetricians can externally manipulate the baby and turn it around into a more favourable position but the Carters mummy is right, this can be uncomfortable at best, if not downright painful. If a doctor suggests this, ask them what experience they have and what their success rate is before you let them do it. Babies do turn at the last minute so don't worry too much yet, ok?

Breastfed for three weeks, but had to supplement with formula right from when he was a few days old while we were still in the hospital - he was losing weight, so not getting enough breastmilk.  Stopped altogether, because things were just not going well.    2. At approximately what age did you start introducing your child to solids?  Our son was a hungry boy (not a fat baby at all).

I breastfed only.  1b.  The health benefits for my daughter were the biggest reason.  Breastfeeding is also economical, healthier for the mother and baby, easy to do once you get the hang of it, and I took good care of my body beyond pregnancy so that my milk would be best for my daughter.  2.  I started introducing my baby to solids when she was 5.5 months old.  3a.  I used both.  3b.  It is really quite easy to make homemade baby food, making it yourself is MUCH cheaper, and the food servings last three times as long as the store-bought food.  However, there were some foods that were not recommended to feed a baby homemade (e.g., carrots) that I bought at the store.  As far as things like grains (oats, barley, rice), I did not prepare that myself because those are harder to prepare at home than fruits and veggies.  4a.  I basically went along with what my doc recommended.  The soft bite spoons and sippy cups are great ways to introduce a child to the concepts of feeding him/herself, for they're easy to use and also provide teething relief, believe it or not!  I essentially have gone along with my daughter's cues: if she shows she's ready for certain types of foods or utensils, then I'll introduce them.  Now that my daughter's getting older (8 months), I also give her "regular" food I know she can master, like yogurt.  4b.  I use Gerber cereals (I always had coupons from them for some reason) and Nature's Goodness prepared food, when I used the prepared food.  The NG brand is more reasonably priced, and they don't use as many additives.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	1. A) Did you.

I tried to breast feed my first but it was a big stuggle so at 2 weeks I gave up and gave him a bottle. It was more convenient for me since his dad could help me feeding and I didnt have to stress about how much he gets to eat.   Snce then I have also bottle fed another boy and a girl                2. At approximately what age did you start introducing your child to solids?  first at 4 mos  second at 3 mos  third at 4 mos                  3. A) When weaning your child, did you use homemade or prepared weaning foods?     both, more store bought though              B) Could you please explain why you chose this.   again it was easier for me to open a jar. I would make mash potatoes etc myself though              4. A) In general, which kinds of weaning products did you give to your child?  started with baby rice cereal, moved onto puree veg and fruit, then meats, added some cheerios and diced fruit pieces  as for products I used soft tip spoons, sippy cups and straw cups                    B) If you used prepared foods, did you use any brands in particular? If so, why did you choose these particular brands?  Gerber, Beechnut, the price and variety in food choices|`|aZjZyccsaa	1 - I breastfed my two daughters only       I breastfed and bottlefed my boys, but that was only because they're twins, if they'd been single babies I would have breastfed only!    Breastfeeding is MUCH easier, no hassle with bottles, food always there and ready, plus great for bonding with baby!    2 - 14/16wks for all 4    3 - My eldest I made everything homemade       My second daughter I used ready made food, same with my twins!    My reasons for using ready made food is because it's a lot harder to make fresh food when you have more than 1 child, plus I think the nutritional content is the same, if not more in ready made meals!    4 - I started with pureed fruit and veg.....    I used Hipp Organic, Heinz mums own, Organix and Cow & Gate    I would have stuck with the Hipp organic, but my twins were getting sick of the same foods over and over, as for the other brands, depends whats on special offer at the time!|`|HUrYSp4oaa	1. bottle feed only as was unable to breast feed    2. 12 wks as this was the norm 20 yrs ago    3 a. mixture of both    b.  homemade when at home, prepared if out/busy/none made up    4.  baby rice then other cereals eg weetabix, rusk, veg fruit and jars such as spagetti bolognese    cow and gate, heinz they were the main ones available at the time 20 yrs ago|`|UT2tv5N3aa	1)  breast fed only    b) health reasons  read whilst pregnant this was better for baby    2)  4 months    3)  both homemade and prepared     b)   i tried both i made some food at the beginning of the month and froze it but when there was not enough time or if i forgot to defrost i would use bought ones    4)  i think i tried most things    b)   didn't really stick to any one|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Hi, hope this helps    1.  A. Bottle Fed only  B. For 2 reasons really, one, I personally didn't want to breast feed       and wanted my husband to be able to feed our children to bond with       them. And two, because with breast feeding you can never tell how      much the baby has actually taken, at least with a bottle you can.    2. With my first, he was a really greedy baby so after having him on food for hungier babies, I started weaning at 3 half months. My second is now 3 months and is no where near ready for weaning yet.      3.  A. When weaning I started on pre prepsred food and went on to home       made after a few weeks.    B. I started with cow and gate baby rice as its eay to make to correct       consistency etc. I went on to home made pureed foods such as       fruit etc.    4.   A. I mostly only used the baby rice although did use a few jars now       and again if I was out somewhere    B. I always used Cow and Gate, The formula was cow and gate and I       Liked the different variety in flavours they had.    Good Luck x|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	1. A) Did you.  X Breast- feed only      B) Please explain why you chose to do this.  Several reasons:  1) Because breastmilk is the best thing for a baby.  2) Because that's the natural thing to do (although I do recognize that some people haven't a choice, so they must use formula).  3) Because it's way more convenient than formula.  4) Because it's way cheaper.  5) Because I love the bonding and closeness it brings.      2. At approximately what age did you start introducing your child to solids?  We started him on cereal with breastmilk at 4 months, veggies at 5 1/2 months, and fruit slightly after that.      3. A) When weaning your child, did you use homemade or prepared weaning foods?  He hasn't been weaned yet... he's 7 1/2 months old and I plan on nursing him until he's 12 months old.  I'm not sure what you mean by weaning foods though anyway.  I don't feed him homemade baby food, if that's what you mean, but I do use organic baby food.    B) Could you please explain why you chose this.   convenience and it's winter, so not very good produce around.    4. A) In general, which kinds of weaning products did you give to your child?  ??    B) If you used prepared foods, did you use any brands in particular? If so, why did you choose these particular brands?  Gerber Organic and some other organic brand my mom just bought for us to try... Nature's Best or something like that?|`|9qQFHK2Qaa	a1[ i bottled fed from start to finish as i felt more comfortable doing it.  2[at about 4 months  3[baby rice from chemists  b[i chose it because i knew it was safe and healthy and also it was a well known branded name also recommended by my health visitor.i also used the same branded cereals such as porridge and banana dessert.|`|5nk13Ifkaa	1. A) Did you.  Breast- feed only      Bottle-feed only      Breast-feed and bottle-feed mixed fed, combination of breast feeding, formula feeding, and pumped breast milk in bottles      (Please tick whichever box is appropriate)      B) Please explain why you chose to do this. Chose to mix feed so hubby could help with feeds and to give us more freedom. Also not very comfortable breast feeding in public so we always had the option of formula or pumped milk in a bottle.                2. At approximately what age did you start introducing your child to solids?   4 months for both of them                3. A) When weaning your child, did you use homemade or prepared weaning foods?  combination of both            B) Could you please explain why you chose this.   store bought stuff for convenience when no time to cook something for baby, homemade stuff when I could for the extra variety, better cost and nutrients.            4. A) In general, which kinds of weaning products did you give to your child?    started with baby rice cereal, moved onto puree veg and fruit, then meats            B) If you used prepared foods, did you use any brands in particular? If so, why did you choose these particular brands?  Mostly Beechnut, great quality, for much cheaper|`|SRsFkNBBaa	breast-fed & bottle-fed  i started off breastfeeding, then gradually moved to the bottle because my son had reflux. so i had to add ceral to his bottle. bring him to work with me, so i don't pump.my other 2 were dont the same way, only i started the bottle becuase i felt they weren't getting enough by the breast.  i started my first 2 on solids at 3 months. by the spoonful, about 4. this one, he gets rice in the bottle  i used both homemade and prepared foods to wean, why, because it was easier for the kids to just eat what we ate.while at home, and gone the prepared. the brands were gerber & nestle . i used these brand because i trusted it when they were younger, so i trusted it now.
NysFTExhaa	Amen!    My husband and I both had to pay our way through college and paid for our own wedding.  This helped us to be frugal with money and not blow a bunch on an extravagant wedding.  We've put a little money away for the kids but the bulk of their college money will have to be raised by themselves.     We're lucky that we haven't been criticized by our families about this because they did the same thing for us.|`|ivhojwpTaa	I'm not. I'll help with food, and things they need, but if they want to go to college, it's their choice and they should learn some financial responsibility.  My sister started an education fund for them, but it's her money and she can do what she wants with it.  You're not being a bad mom.  I'll help pay for the first wedding, after that, they're on their own.|`|jcXSNjowaa	ill pay some college..and no i wont pay a wedding but i will help.|`|TfAxeV3Maa	I have already started a college fund for my 6 month old..but it is a personal choice for every parent to make and there are pros and cons of both and I can completely respect your decision. My parents are paying for what scholarships and grants don't cover, so that may have impacted my decision. Weddings tho? Psh they're on their own!|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	For a wedding, yes. I do believe that family should help pay for their children's weddings.    The college thing, I'm not too sure. I know a couple who had 7 children, and all 7 of their children graduated college. The parents never paid a dime.    I know I won't pay ALL of their college bill, but I'm not sure if I wouldn't be willing to help out. My son is only 5 months old, so I guess I have time to decide! :)    However, I will say this. I don't think it's wrong for parents not to help with college, and I don't think is wrong for parents to help with college.|`|UwYS5fKQaa	not actually putting money away for college but we are buying 100$ I series savings bonds,they start off at face value and gain interest from there. Just once a year around his birthday we will be buying them, He isn't yet one yet.My family members are also buying them for him, these can be used for anything he wants when he is old enough to use them but i don't know if i will just give them to him when he is 18 though. Maybe when he is about to get married or graduates College. He wont know about them either (so im not going to be harassed for them.)|`|QveBSjFSaa	I am putting away money for my children to do with what they may, but of course, the accounts are in my name, which makes the discretion thereof up to me.  I pump up community college and eloping/small weddings, and I also pump up the importance of good grades, and extracurricular activities as a way to help with college or trade schools in the area of scholarships or grants.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Sheesh that's harsh!    College is so much more beneficial when you don't graduate with $40,000 or more of student loan debt to begin your life (and that could be for 1 year!).  Student loans stink and trying to pay them back when you get your measly first job out of college wages is very difficult.      Yes I have started a college fund for my son, it won't pay for everything but it will certainly help.    But I do believe there are scholarships and grants that can be utilized and applied for that are also a great help.    I mean even a small donation of $10 a week starting from birth will add up to a lot by the time they go to college and will be a huge help so I will certainly do so, if I can spend $10 on a few bags of pretzels I can certainly spend it on a college fund for my child.    Weddings:  I have a boy and am due with my second, also a boy, the girl's family can pay as they are supposed to! hehe|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I actually agree with you.  We have three kids...we don't have the means to put money away for their college/university...but even if we did, I agree, it isn't a parents responsability.  That doesn't mean I have a problem with those that can afford it and do afford it...it is great if you can, but a person should not ever feel guilty for not being able to afford it or believing they shouldn't...it is good for a perosn to figure out on thier own how to get that education...they will learn more from that then the actual education.    As for the wedding  thing....it is tradiition for the brides family to pay for the wedding....the world has changed a lot though...I told my daughters that if they marry straight out of our home prior to like 20 years old then we would probably do what we could towards the cost...not pay it all because we -probably couldn't anyway...if they've been an adult for some time and living thier own lives in their own homes then no, we would not contribute...I find it annoying when people pay for their 35 year old daughters wedding to the cost of thousands of dollars...get real.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I would definately put away some money for my kids education/wedding/blah blah if I could only get my act together and start saving some money... ^_^    It might be the case that most of our income will go toward actually raising my kid, and she'll have to just do well in school and apply for grants or financial aid if she wants to go to college. And if that happens, that'll be okay I think.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I will without a doubt be saving money for college.   I don't want her (soon to be them) to worry about spending years paying student loans back. Not everyone is entitled to grants, and not everyone receives scholarship.  Student loans can be really crippiling, I have seen it happen many times, and if I can in anyway help my daughter(daughters/son) to avoid them, I will do.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	No you do not have too...but I do not believe you stop being a parent when you kid turns 18 either. I do have college funds for them because I want to give them the best start into adulthood as possible. It will not be enough to cover the entire cost...they will still need to work, get grants, scholarships and such but it will help get them started. I worked my way in school,  but I remember how sometimes I was so stressed over finances, or that I had to work so many hours at a job... that it took away from my studies.   As for weddings, if and when the time comes I may help. But my kids may not get married or they may latter in adult life. What I do have is a 13 year old honor student with her eyes on Harvard and I intend to help her reach her dream. Do I have too...no. BUT I am her Mom and always will be, I would give her the world if I could ...so the least I can do is set aside some money for her.|`|kZRTekoJaa	i would love it if i could afford to pay for weddings and college and whatever else but realistically i don't think i will be able to afford it.  and honestly, i don't think there is anything wrong with the way you feel on this subject.  you are so right when you say that they don't need a wedding. not an expensive one especially. so if they choose to be out thousands of dollars or more for a wedding, why should you have to foot the bill? so don't let anyone make you feel bad for what you feel is right for your kids.    i personally, have a savings plan in mind for my kids b/c i would love to help them start their adult life off well if i can...but above all children need to be taught the importance of responsible spending. materialism (that led to living beyond ones means) is partly what's wrong with the economy right now! so as long as you teach your children how to be financially responsible then you are doing your parental duties and that's better then simply paying for everything for them.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	the current annual costs of attending my alma mater exceed $45,000/year.  doubtless they'll be substantially higher than that by the time my kids go to college.  no part-time job is going to pay for that, and when you're getting in the range of $200,000 for a 4-year education, that's a pretty massive debt to be saddled with one year out of college.  yes, i will help my kids pay for college to the extent i can.  i would like them to have the option to go to the best college they are admitted to.  that opportunity made a tremendous difference to me.    as for weddings, i'd contribute something if asked, but i'm not a fan of huge, expensive weddings and if one of my kids wants that then i think they can reasonably pay for that themselves.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I think it makes you are great mom and I'm with you!   My siblings and I all paid for our own education mostly through scholarships and I worked part time to pay for my expenses. This is their first step into adult hood and their first step to prove themselves responsible adults, doesn't do much for them when you are footing the bill for them while they learn how to do keg stands.   I will support them and drive them to every college interview and be completely involved but I will not go in debt for it.   I also will only be paying for part of a wedding and it will be more a gift and surely won't be over 100 dollars. The man my daughter wants to marry should prove himself an adult ready to take care of her and pay the bill for it, so should my son when he becomes a man. For as tradition, it is the mans responsibility to pay for the daughter (like a dowry was) this whole brides family pays for it thing is relatively new.|`|0TGpz08paa	My daughter is 3 and a half and so far, I have saved over 5 000 $ for her education and I will continue saving as much as I can for her.

Problem - I'm not loaded and at this point in time, it is more important that my husband and I take care of our future  needs than college when the kids can get loans for that.  I can't get a loan for my old age.  As for a wedding, my plan and goal is to assist.  My parents helped me.  I did not expect it nor demand it.  I appreciated it however.  Basically in the end - my parents paid for half and my husband and I paid half. It worked out that way.  My mom said I will pay for X and then my dad after he found out how much the reception was agreed to pay half.  i was expecting to pay the whole thing.  I genuinely appreciated their monetary help but I would have made it with out it.  I would like to do the same for my kids.|`|YQOT68xFaa	I'd love to sock away some money for their college if possible. And I will definitely put some away for their weddings. IMO a wedding IS something a person needs. I don't want my kids shacking up with anyone, and I don't want them to have to get married at the courthouse. A marriage is something worth celebrating! My folks set aside $2000 for my wedding and it was ample. We had a lovely wedding and I got the dress of my dreams (for $200!!).     Anyways, yes, I will help fund college and weddings if possible.

College is expensive; loans, grants, and scholarships dont cover everything. Espechally with the economy how it is, the gov't isnt giving out as much financial aid.    Most parents cant afford to cover all educational costs, but I think you should try to at least help contribute.    My parents and grandparents have saved enough to send me to a 4 year college PLUS grad school, and they are not rich... they just saved up, and put their money in a good educational fund that is tax free.     As a result, I dont have to work which is awesome, I have more time to study and I have a 3.7 GPA. That will come in handy getting into a good grad school and in turn making more money to someday take care of them in their old age.    College is not a necessity, but it is DEFINENTLY a smart idea to have a better shot at jobs and make more money.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	yes my baby isnt even here yet and i have alot of change in a piggy bank and i add to it daily and will until they go to college if they need a car to work i will ask them okay which do you perfer college money or a car if they say car then no i will not be paying for college.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Advil and Motrin are the same thing.    You are not supposed to bring a fever down to normal, just down to between 100-102F    http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...  A fever does not necessarily need to be treated. If a child is playful and comfortable, drinking plenty of fluids, and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to be helpful. Steps should be taken to lower a fever if the child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or having difficulty sleeping. The goal is to bring the temperature between about 100 and 102 degrees F -- not to eliminate the fever.    When trying to reduce a fever, first remove excess clothing or blankets. The environment should be comfortably cool (one layer of light weight clothing, and one lightweight blanket to sleep). Two medicines are useful for reducing fever in children: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Children's Advil or Motrin). Acetaminophen is given every 4-6 hours, and works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Don't use under three months of age without first having the child examined by a physician. Ibuprofen is given every 6-8 hours, and helps fight the inflammation at the source of the fever. It is not approved for children under 6 months. Both medicines may be given for stubborn fevers, but be very careful about using the correct dose of each.    A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a febrile child (after medication is given -- otherwise the temperature bounces right back up). Cold baths or alcohol rubs cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.    http://askdrsears.com/html/8/t082100.asp  ARE FEVERS DANGEROUS?    No. Many parents have a misconception that fevers are a bad thing and a sign that there is some serious underlying illness. This simply is not true. Fever is a normal and healthy response of the body to an illness. The body's immune system releases chemicals that raise the body temperature. This is part of the normal infection-fighting process.  WHAT TEMPERATURE CONSTITUTES A FEVER?        * Normal temperature ? 97 to 99 degrees (36 to 37.2 Celcius).      * Low-grade fever ? 99 to 100.9 degrees (37.3 to 38.3 Celcius).      * Common fever ? 101 to 103.5 degrees (38.4 to 39.7 Celcius).      * High fever ? any fever over 103.6 degrees (39.8 Celcius).     SHOULD I TREAT A LOW GRADE FEVER?    No. Low-grade fevers are helpful in fighting off infection. You should only treat a fever when it is making your child miserable. Treat your child, not the fever.     [..]    GETTING THROUGH THE NIGHT        * First step ? decide if the fever warrants treatment as discussed above.      * Medications            o Acetaminophen? this fever reducer/pain reliever has been around a long time and is effective is most cases. It can be given every 4 hours. Click on it for dosing chart.            o New research in 2001 has shown that giving an initial double dose of acetaminophen for high fevers is both safe and more effective to bring down that high fever fast. Only give a double dose if the fever is high. You can only give a double dose once every few days if needed. Any other doses should be the regular dose.            o Ibuprofen? this newer medication is also effective for fever and pain. It often works better for higher fevers, and lasts longer too. It can be given every 6 hours. It was previously only approved for children 6 months and older. Recently it was approved safe and effective for infants down to two months of age. Click on it for dosing chart.            o Using both medications ? it is best to only use one of these two medications. However, if one by itself isn't enough or wears off too soon, then it is safe to give the other medication on top of the first without waiting. Another option is to alternate between them every 3 hours. Give acetaminophen at 8:00, ibuprofen at 11:00, acetaminophen at 2:00 and so on.            o WARNING ? don't give ASPIRIN to children 12 and under.       * Vomiting - if your child is vomiting and won't keep down any medication, you can use acetaminophen suppositories available over the counter. Click here for the acetaminophen dosing chart.      * Lukewarm bath and cool washcloth ? this can help get a fever down fast, especially if it is high, but only use along with, not instead of fever lowing medication.      * Cool liquids to drink can help cool down a fever and keep your child well hydrated.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	Put in luck warm bath. If the fever persist I would speak with child's doctor|`|vue9NOhYaa	The first question is, DO you need to bring his fever down?  Fever is not harmful.  Fever is useful in helping the body fight infection.  So, if he's not uncomfortable from the fever itself, you don't have to bring it down.      If he IS uncomfortable, and normal meds aren't working, you could try a tepid bath.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	Try and put him in a tepid (NOT COLD) water and let him soak.  You never mentioned how high the fever is.  My daughter's pediatrician has told me that anything above 101.4 to bring her in.  If it is below that and as long as she is still eating and ESPECIALLY drinking then it is ok.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Is his temperature still 101 or above?

In the meantime, call the dr.    TX Mom|`|3gXQPso5aa	Motrin will work I had that problem the other day with my 2 year old. I went to the hospital and they gave her Mortin fever reducer and I worked. her fever was 102.1|`|HF97Rs9qaa	Give him LOTS of water or pedialyte... Moniter it, anything over 101 can be a concern for young children. If it goes up and he gets worse I would take him to the Dr or the ER.     Make him lay and rest, giving fluids regularly and maybe you can put cool rags on his head and neck.    You can keep trying tylenol in the correct dose amounts.    I am sorry the little guy is sick, I hope he gets well soon!!!|`|q595MhH8aa	Try Motrin! Motrin always seems to work best at breaking the fevers for the little one! Good Luck!!|`|AA11981363	I have a 2 yo (girl) my doctor has told me the following    1. Remove one layer of clothing (if more than 1)  2. Give her a bath with luke water for about 20 mins.  3. Give her advil.    So, if you already gave him advil and the fever is not coming down I would give him a bath...|`|GBcruGCmaa	Well how bad is it?  If its not higher than 101 leave it alone.  Second if it is ober 101. Put cold comprses on his head and feet. But make sure the coolness does not spook him. Make sure the water is cold, but not to cold and slowly dab it on his feet then leave the towel there. Then do the same with the head. After that for about 15 minutes, then wait for about 20 and repeat. If this dosent work call your doctor for further instructions.|`|62f1d0961574fb4ceb5c3f96048930aaaa	Get some Be Kool packs. they're sheets to put on the kids foreheads and backs that are really cheap and work wonders!!  It's like having a wet, cool washcloth on for 8 hours straight. I live by those things.  Motrin seems to work better than Tylenol and maybe youre not giving the right dosage -- your baby might weigh more.  Try the BeKool pads and dont dunk your baby in a bath. Just pass a cool wash cloth over her body and blow a little air on her.  That should work.     http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...
mqHL4UcRaa	Well, unfortunately there is no way of "preventing" stretch marks as the doctors say.     As for lotions, cocoa butter is the best you can use while being pregnant. It relieves itching/dryness like no other. And it stays on almost all day.    In my opinion I think you are more prone to stretch marks if you have really dry skin. I'm 26 weeks and I've been applying cocoa butter every morning & night, and so far I have no stretch marks and my skin looks great!!!  So I advise using it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nothing prevents stretch marks. If you are genetically inclined to get them you will. Rubbing lotion on your belly has other good effects though like baby bonding and it will help you not itch.|`|01vMpHkWaa	nothing prevents it, just makes them less apparent  if it has vitamin E in it, then is it just as good as cocoa butter  i also use olay body wash in the shower along with cocoa butter for stretch marks...    i dont have any stretch marks on my tummy...but i think that is because of my traits. i have a few on my breasts but thanks to the cocoa butter, they arent very noticeable|`|tu7aqUoxaa	TO BE HONEST, I DON'T EVEN THINK COCOA BUTTER REALLY WORKS|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Nothing can prevent stretch marks. All cocoa butter does is make your skin feel more comfortable while it stretches.     I don't call them stretch marks, I call them war wounds. :)|`|AA10015577	Nothing can prevent stretchmarks.  If you are bound to get them, then you will therefore get them.  Only lotions and oils can reduce the appearance and itchiness.  Now between choosing shea over cocoa in reducing appearance of stretchmarks, I don't know what would be better.  I would use both.  HTH!  Good luck!|`|He1sIjeyaa	just like everyone else is saying...you can't prevent them...if youre gonna get them theres nothing you can do to stop it...its horrible i know...i got some of the worst and tried everything!!|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	I bought cocoa butter that had shea butter and i thought it was working untill all of a sudden like 3 weeks ago stretch marks appeared I was pretty angry so its true what they say regardless of what cream you use if you are going to get them you are going to get them :( but i heard from other people that they used baby oil and almond oil and that helped them obviously because they didnt have stretch marks but they told me too late    Good Luck|`|qImMwhUHaa	None of it worked for me although it can help subside the itching from stretching. It depends on how much elastin is in your skin and how much weight you gain, not how much goo you rub on your belly:) Seriously.|`|NxyTBTMvaa	cocoa butter is very good for strechmarks. i used it when i gained weight to fast and had stretch marks. but if you want better results you can buy a stretch mark cream specialy made for being pregnant, i use maternity thyme stretch mark cream from the maternity store and im 31 weeks and  have no stretch marks . but i dont think shea butter is the same as cocoa butter . i guess it depends on your skin type to.
VudhjHi2aa	I had the same problem. And I got my son the same Earth Best biscuits and my son hated them. He just would not eat them. But I did find the Gerber ones at H.E.B. and Baby's R US. And when I gave him that one He LOVED them.    If you don't have these stores near you I would try your local grocery store.    Good Luck :o)|`|KG3MptIdaa	I usually find them at Shaw's, but every once in awhile I can't find certain baby foods/snacks anywhere because someone makes a huge purchase of their entire stock... And the surrounding areas Market Basket, Wal-Mart, Rite-Aid, etc.     It usually takes a couple days for the stores to restock if that happens. Next time you are at whatever store you go to locally, just ask the management if it is something they carry regularly or if they could possibly carry it (since I am sure their are other moms in your area that would like them too).     When all else fails... Call the stores before you go there and they can check the inventory for you and hold it.    Best of luck!|`|8DnIXwnyaa	no i just bought some the other day.  they are called biter biscuits.|`|ENANtueuaa	Gerber still makes them. They are called Biter Biscuits, and they are in a yellow box. I have seen them at walmart in with the other Gerber snacks for toddlers. Hope this helps!|`|pXeskVZwaa	Don't buy things from WalMart, it only gets a recall a week later|`|xCFTIqpxaa	they have the biter biscuits at wal mart or even your local sotre, i see them everywhere,i would reccoment the other puff thigns in the container tho, theye not as messy! the biters stain like you wouldnt believe!
QGkBZFqWaa	Okay I reccomend buying the plasic applicators because they slide in easier.    1. Unwrap the tampon.    2. Before putting it in, try getting it a teeny bit moist, it makes it easier.    3. Find your vagina hole and push it in a couple inches.    4. You know the part where the string sticks out? Push that layer up towards your vagina to release the tampon. The string should hang out of you    5. Pull the applicator away from you [the tampon should be inside of you]    6. Wrap the applicator in toilet paper and throw it away.    To take the tampon out all you have to do is pull the string out of your vagina and the rest comes with it. Flush the tampon down the toilet. Good luck! It's not so bad once you get used to it, then it jusat becomes a hassle lol.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	You take it and put inside as far as the bottom of  top applicator than you pull that down. I change mine if I start to see blood on the string or if it has been about 4-5 hrs since i last changed it. You don't have to take it out to use the restroom But I always do if I am going  2. I hope this helps|`|vue9NOhYaa	There are instructions in the box.  Relax, and follow the instructions.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	get the slender ones with pastic app/ use KY jelly adnd relax it will be ok|`|yjQOeuTGaa	Just relax. Use a slender one and jst know that u'll be okay.|`|ClbJXmr6aa	open the box of tampons find the direction diagram and do everything on it step by step... dont be scared they are ALOT better than pads|`|AA10647819	the package should have instructions in it; get the smallest size possible.    it's nervewracking the first time; i'm old & a mom  now and i still remember just about passing out trying to use one for the first time.    just read the instructions that come in the package. & i'm sure you can find something online.|`|aPN7NsvXaa	Is this a serious question?  A...ask your mom, or your school nurse.  B...all tampon boxes come with an insert.    And...it is recommended that you do not use tampons until you have had your period at least a year.|`|3LvlXDOAaa	there's instructions and diagrams on the leaflet in the box.|`|MsLKIJWJaa	ok I was scared too when I first tried a tampon.   don't use the cardboard ones because those hurt idk I never managed to get one all the way in. I use the tampax pearl ones because they are much more easier to put on well all the plastic applicators are easier. Sometimes when I have a heavy flow I gently squish the super ones because it feels uncomfortable when I sit.     1st you open the tampon.  2nd find the opening which is in like the middleish   3rd slip it in but don't go all the way up.   4th push the stick that lets the tampon out of the container.   5th take out the plastic applicator and throw it away.    you have to relax while doing this and also make sure you put it in right because it hurts when you don't. don't use it more that 4 hours and wear a light pad just incase you leak ... there are also instructions with the tampons and their pretty helpful just breath and relax. hope everything goes well.
m0PVHJIvaa	maybe try Planned Parenthood...the website is http://www.plannedparenthood.org/nyc/ and street address:  Administrative Office  26 Bleecker Street  New York, NY 10012-2413|`|jNgh3e3Faa	What is dpo?  Blood tests are rarely free, I think.   Planned parenthood and crisis pregnancy may be able to help. Call around and ask.   You should make a doctor's appointment if you are concerned.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No one does a blood test for free. If a urine test isn't working for you you will have to pay. Planned parenthood may be able to do it at a reduced fee though.    Urine tests cost about 40 cents each in bulk. That is why public health offices can afford to give them for free. Phlebotomists don't work for free though.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call around the free clinics in your local phonebook. Planned Parenthood doesn't give free blood tests but they test for a smaller fee than doctors offices. It may not be pregnancy though...Keep that in mind. You might want to see a doctor along with getting a blood test.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	planned parenthood?  free clinics?    google "planned parenthood city, nyc" or "free clinics city, nyc"|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Planned Parenthood MIGHT supply them.  Google pregnancy clinics in your area.
5N3odm3Qaa	No, four weeks with two babies does not make sense. I could see how you might think that but it just doesn't work that way.    Perhaps she only miscarried one fetus. The other may still be inside of her. It happens and I've seen it several times.    Another guess is that the former twin is normal and is a bit undersized. Thus, on an ultrasound it may show 8 weeks gestation but in the absence of another fetus as a reference point, the doctor made some incorrect assumptions. Bear in mind that those ultrasound machines are not bullet proof. Your friend may very well be 5 or 6 weeks pregnant. A woman is most fertile in the weeks and months after being pregnant. She may have conceived again almost immediately.    Your friend may have also missed her periods because of the terminated pregnancy. Many women can take months to resume their period after being pregnant.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I agree with Baby Boy Due...    But also, did she see a doctor about her miscarriage?  Did they make sure it was a complete miscarriage?|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Maybe she was pregnant with twins and miscarried only 1 of them.|`|GEfpzUNvaa	UM her dr should have investigated more on those dates.. that makes no sense... they should be doing an ultra sound yesterday|`|kT7GVOosaa	umm... no. that has nothing to do with twins. when I finally went to the dr. my LMP said I was 10 weeks and I was only 4. dates don't have to add up. plus it take a while for the sperm ti fertilize the egg anyway. the true conception date can never be known because no one actually knows how long it takes each mans sperm to get to each woman's eggs.

PS- That sounds so sweet :)|`|yjQOeuTGaa	I agree. Its more important to have friends. Go ahead and send him one with a sorry note and write Friends? and if he wants to be all weird about it, let him. If i really wanna be friends, he will respond. Besides, even if he doesnt, everything will work out fine. U can just grab some new friends. im sure you can.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	this is the perfect opportunity! send him a heart that says "I'm really sorry.

"Giving a buck to ______, and getting to say "hope you're doing well" also.  What a bargain!"    It opens the door for him, without seeming at all stalker-ish.|`|zB2PIUmzaa	send one!|`|852b64707eee9567246c31b995f4a087aa	If you have promised to leave him alone, don't contact him.

b4fYwZeraa	I had some minor cramping and was lightheaded. My periods became so light I only have to use panty liners now and I had some pretty heavy periods before I got the Mirena. After it's removed there is a quick return to fertility and  you can begin trying to concieve right away.|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is some pain during insertion of the Mirena. (Or any IUD). But it doesn't take very long, and once it's in place, you shouldn't feel it.    The Mirena does not make your periods heavier. Quite the reverse, in fact.  Most women who have it find that, after a few months, their periods become extremely light, or disappear completely.    (Other, non-hormone IUDs do often result in heavier, more painful periods.)    It should not cause any long term fertility issues once it's removed.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	When having it inserted I felt minor cramping, nothing to bad.  After having it inserted I bled lightly for 6 weeks. Now I only get a period every 3 months and it's not heavy at all.

Give it a couple of weeks and see how it goes if its making no difference then try something else. Its just like buying make up, what works for you might not work for someone else and what do you do if you buy a foundation you don't like? You try another brand. Dieting is no different.
kZRTekoJaa	you deserve to be punished. first off, the child lives in America. and either way, a child is not responsible for how any gov't runs.  why did you choose to make an example out of him? you could have picked any boy that had to use the bathroom, any day. choosing him makes him a target for immature and racist 6th grader comments about a society he is not even part of.  not to mention the embarrassment he surely felt wetting his pants in front of his peers.  if he was my child, i would sue the school, school district, whoever i had to, until you were fired. personally, what you did disgusts me. it's not about political correctness; it's about you embarrassing and singling out a child and you're only defense is that Saudi Arabia is a sexist society.  i think the school should make an example out of you and fire you, to teach your students that rude sexist acts (such as yours) should be punished.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	I would have fired you that same day. You need to end teaching children and find a job that is not connected in any way with children.  What on gods green earth were you thinking of. Did you not learn anything when you took your training. Do you realize, this could cause this child to have medical problems ? When you teach, every student in you class room is treated equal, no matter race, size, or his / her ability.  Do the rest of us who teach a big favour.  Resign and do it right now. Your class will be far better off with a sub in for a few days, till another teacher can take over.  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th.

I'm not one for political correctness, personally, but I do think that respect for human beings - regardless of color or anything else - is of utmost importance.  It's about respect.

You should also lose your US citzenship.|`|pXeskVZwaa	Don't know why people respond to trolls :/|`|muAEP3bGaa	That may be true that women in Saudi Arabia can't go to the bathroom when they want to, but that doesn't give you the right to deny this child the opportunity to relieve himself, especially when he needs to!      You didn't let him go because he's Arab or because he's Muslim? If it's "Arab", it was a "racist" act; if it's "Muslim", it was an act of "religious hatred".  In this case, since women not being allowed to go to the bathroom when they want sounds more like a religious doctrine, I'd say it was the latter.     I can empathize with a potential job loss, so if I were you I would tell them that you sincerely regret the incident and have learned from it.  Better yet, offer to make a formal apology and (if possible) some charity or community service.  It may be humbling, but you'll be a better person for it - hopefully, you'll save your job in the process but, even if you don't, you'll have grown as a person.|`|smGTHpTmaa	HA HA HA HA YOU DESERVE TO LOSE YOUR JOB.

I'm german, if I were in your class would you tell me I couldn't go the bathroom, because Jews suffered during the Holocaust??????    You are ignorant and shouldn't teach anywhere, ever!|`|dbgf2Vuhaa	HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!! WOW YOU SHOULD GET FIRED U RASIST IF I WAS HIM I WOULD CRY!!!!|`|2ZzcOkWkaa	I really hope you're trolling to get a reaction out of people. How in the hell can you think that a boy in 6th grade is responsible for what other people do, let alone other people that has no relation to him aside from his ethnicity and religion, in an entirely different country? You are, indeed, a racist prick. You're the racist and sexist one for discriminating against this innocent boy in such a bigoted way. You're also quite the bigot for assuming all people of Muslim faith and of Arabian ethnicity are sexist. A large percentage of Muslims, especially Muslim-Americans, do not practice nor do they represent the sexist stereotypes that idiots like Fox News and idiots like you brand them with. Stop promoting stereotypes and acting flaunting your mis-placed authority. And please get the **** out of our country - You're the kind of idiot that needs to get stoned.    I really hope you do get fired, and I hope you get your *** sued.
xZG0q6vXaa	After my tubes were cut, burned, then re-tied, I took several tests (even with the doctor) that said I was pregnant!      It might just be cause every month does not have the same amount of days; February really messes things up with it's 28 days {29 days every 4 years}.    I do have a niece that the entire time 9 months the tests said negative.  Only ultra sound showed positive when she was 5 or 6 months.|`|NFeKUgWCaa	My last period was December 22nd, and I still haven't gotten it.  I took a test a week ago and it came back negative..   Take a blood test, you'll find out soon.  I took one today, and I'll find out tomorrow. :)
bTlhBX3daa	It means that you are effacing. I.e. your cervix is thinning out. This happens so that the baby can get through the birth canal. It may mean early labor since you are not due until April, but if your Dr. didn't say anything about being worried, I'm sure you are fine.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	if you arent due for 2 months you should not be that short.  I saw the perinatologist this morning because I'm considered high risk due to have one preemie already (35 weeks).      THe cervix should be at a 4 or greater is what they told me (unless of course you are near your due date.  Mine was 4.7.  They said a 4 is about the length of your index finger.      Are the going to do vaginal sonos regularly until you deliver to check the length?    I'm supposed to have one every 2 weeks until I deliver from here on out.      I would maybe ask about steriod injections to help babies lungs mature because it seems as though you will be delivering early.      effacement/thinning out/and shortening are all the same thing.  It is not the same as dilating.    I wanted to add i babysit a little boy born at 32 weeks and weighing 2lbs and 13 oz . He is now 25 months old. He only spent 13 days in the nicu and is now a healthy/happy little guy.  My son born at 35 weeks weight 7lbs 6 oz!  and was as healthy as can be (aside from some jaundice)|`|3EhoJ42zaa	It means your body is progressing to get ready for labor and delivery.  You got some good answers with your first question, you're only going to get similar responses.  You need to be 10cm and 100% effaced to deliver.  You are only a 1cm, it doesn't mean anything at this point.  It just means your cervix is thinning and opening up, however long this takes nobody knows.  You can sit at 1cm for weeks or go into labor in a few days.  Next time you have a question regarding your pregnancy, ask your doctor.  That is what they are paid for.  When they say something you do not understand just simply ask "what does that mean?"      It does NOT mean early labor.  It  is nothing to worry abotu at all.  Women can be dilated and effaced for months before delivery and still go over due or sometimes women are not dilated at all and then the next day go into labor.  So do not worry, it is normal and does not indicate early labor.|`|jcXSNjowaa	that its effacing. thinning out.|`|tu7aqUoxaa	YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE DOCTOR
32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Sonja Elise is a beautiful Name.and I really like it..|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Very pretty|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Very pretty. I love Elise as a middle name. Sonja would be pretty spelled Sonia too.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	wellllllllll.............|`|9A5UgnNVaa	I like it, it's very pretty. :)|`|EkLJDcc7aa	I like it.  Another name that would sound nice is Sophia Elise.|`|0hNGStuOaa	I am disapointed with the name Sonja Elise.|`|xZG0q6vXaa	I like both names!  Am curious as to how you will pronounce first name?  The correct way is the same as SONYA, but I had a classmate who said it with a "J" sound.|`|e8WVidSsaa	I really do like it, except for one thing. Since the first name ends with a vowel and the middle name starts with one, it tends to run together when you say it.|`|oIwyc5w2aa	I don't care for the name Sonja.  Bad memory from high school.  Elise is pretty though.
819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	I bought a regular pregnancy test and it was a week before my missed period and it told me i was pregnant right away and i took 4 more and they all said the same thing. if its 3 days im pretty sure it can start sensing the chemical already to see if your pregnant    Good Luck :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I just looked up the amount of hormone it detects and it depends on the type, if it's the + or - one then you can go ahead and try now. If it's the one that has two windows and one window would give you two lines if you were pregnant I I then you should wait. Keep in mind even if you are testing early and are pregnant it may not show up until later. Give it a shot though if you want. You may get lucky ;)|`|9vgZNLP8aa	The "early detection" tests are very misleading. Sure, they can tell up to so many days before your period is due but ONLY if your body is making enough of the pregnancy hormone required to get a positive result.     Good luck.|`|RcVnujilaa	Check the box.  I think most all of them say they can be used up to 5 days before your missed period...but they are more likely to show an accurate result after you have missed your period. When the levels are higher.  Id say wait, but i totally understand not wanting to! :)  Good luck!|`|InZU5aaxaa	Stop thinking about it. Give your period a full week then try. I found that the cheap pregnancy test is just as effective as the regular early predictive test. If you do decided to use the one at home go buy another one. Buy a cheap one, I'm telling you they work just as good.|`|NxyTBTMvaa	some pregnacy tests detect the pregnancy hormone better then others, i took first response and it said i wasn't pregnant and then a week later i took another and it said i was so it all depends how far along you are. most tests cant detect until atleast 4weeks anyways so count back to the first day of your last period and then count four weeks and if by your fourth week and it says your not pregnant wait another week and check again if you still havent got your period and if it still says your not pregnant go to your doctor they will send you for a blood test .
5IlaGPxUaa	Your an idiot...  Where are your morals?    God i Hate Trolls!!|`|HMBVk5cYaa	Bad idea.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Why would he want to bring his children into a broken home?  Children DESERVE a mother and a father who love each other and are a family.  I'm not sure what YOUR issues are, but you need to straighten them out.  I have a feeling your marriage isn't going to make it.|`|JuRtPdiVaa	are you stupid?|`|weE5FxCfaa	having a child with someone creates an incredible bond.  your fiance may choose to be with the mother of his children over you in the end.  also i am a parent and i would be so sad to see my kids only on the weekend or a few days a week so your fiance may want to be with his kids more than you are willing to give.  kids also take 100% of the attention so are you willing to take a back seat to his children when they are around?  also if it would not bother you for your fiance to have sex with some random woman then i think you don't truly love him like you think you do.  it can take months of regular sex to achieve pregnancy. are you really willing for that to happen?  seems to me that if your fiance wants children that badly and you don't then you are not meant to be together, because that is a HUGE issue in a marriage and will eventually lead to divorce.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Stupid idea!  You are playing around, not only with your feelings, but your fiances feelings, the woman he would be fathering the kids of...and...most importantly...those children to be.  Now, there is nothing wrong with you not wanting children and him wanting children...unfortunately, this does not work in a relationship.  Sorry, but your relationship is destined to fail if you both feel so totally different about his issue...we aren't talking about you likeing chinese food and him preferring Tai food...we are talking about a life long commitment to have or not to have children...its a biggy...not fiar to him not to have em and not fair to you or (the children) if you have them and only one of you wants them. Sorry, I know you probably don't want to hear this, but then you shouldn't have asked the fquestion if you weren't prepared to hear things you didn't want to hear.|`|FP8Avd3oaa	Wow!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	whats the point of getting married than? if you truly can not agree on an issue as big as this, you might as well just break it off and find someone with the same views as you. he probably wants to have kids with you, not just some ho who happens to come along.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Okay so you are saying that you want your husband to have an affair just to get pregnant. An affair that may get him to want this woman more than you because she actually wants to have kids, just so you wont have to change diapers and be around kids. It sounds like you just need to break it off now before he dumps you for his baby's momma|`|GuK9yLGJaa	uhh wow ok it could work but dont you think that a relationship would develope between the two? she will have sex take his money for child support and im sure you will at some point have to yell at them i think that is a good idea in theory but there are alot of things that will bother you in the long run it would probably just be best to not do that.|`|vPo8Ima8aa	You're a nut. Why don't you give up on the relationship now because if this is your solution then you don't belong in a family and you should either find someone who doesn't want kids or grow old alone.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	good grief.i bet next time you are on here, you will ask if it is okay that your husband sees his baby mamas on the side. because, after all, he wants more than one child, right?    i see that you are serious. if you think there will be nothing between the childs mother and your husband you are wrong. after all, he is "picking" her right? why would he pick somone he doesn't like? his child will be coming from her. thats why people get married and have children with their partners, becuase they like them,thier personalties, looks, morals values, goals etc. and the worst thing you can be in any relationship is over-confident. that is when the **** usually starts to open up. is when you think you have it in the bag-  one thing you aren't mentioning is the "mother". what happens if she does develop a liking/love towards your husband, and when and if he doesn't towards her, she becomes mad, and takes him to court? alot of the time in these situations, the whole thing doesn't go well anyway. she decides that she made a mistake, and acts on it accordingly. it is a bad situation all around, and i think you should think about it before you do it. there are planty of men out there that do not want children. and their are plenty of women that do.|`|Bi7esswoaa	Marriage is for one man & one woman.  It is a marriage between 2 people and 2 people only.  Part of marriage is growing a family.  If you ever consider another woman to take part of ANYTHING that has been set asaid for 1 husband & 1 wife, you are giving place to total and complete destructin to your marriage from the beginning.  If any of these thoughts are genuine, you should forget about even considering marriage, take some time and find out what marriage is REALLY all about (re-evaluate your concept of marriage) and just give yourself asome time to mature before making this decision on marriage.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	ur insane.
Bs8sllD9aa	Try to eat small meal 6 times a day you might have had your sugar levels to low.|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I heard the hot flashes occur because your hormone levels are going down and that this is perfectly normal. I've had the shortness of breath too.  Just relax, take it easy, eathealthyy and all that jazz.  If you start getting other weird symptoms that worry you I suggest you call up your doctor. He or she won't get mad that you call often.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. I get that all the time. Where I will over heat, feel like Im getting hot flashes, and I'll start to get really dizzy. Thats normal in pregnancy. Don't worry about it.
oDyNiJi7aa	My daughter is 3.  She helps with everything. What I mean is this.  If something needs to be thrown out she says "me do it"! So, I'll let her do it.  If I am cleaning up she wants to help me.  When I hang up her clothes she wants to help so I do get her involved with it.  She helps make her bed, she picks up her toys, and washes her body.  When it is time to get dressed she does it all by herself.  There are plenty of activities a child can do.  My daughter likes to draw, read books, play with play dough, paint, color, play with her dolls, go on walks, play at the park, throw the ball, roller skate, rides her bike, and her scooter.  The possibilities are endless.  Safety measures for a 3 year old is the same as a smaller child.  Once the child is older they get into so much more.  As for what I do in my home is I have door knob covers one the doors I don't want to open, cabinets have locks on them that I don't want her to get into. Discipline measures that I use are the 1-2-3 magic, love and logic, and natural consequences. When it comes to discipline it is a personal choice.  If you spank make sure it isn't out of anger.  Make sure what ever you choose to do you are consistence with it.   I wish you the best of luck on your journey of parenting!|`|3fYRi1y4aa	My son is 4 and hes in prek.  He cleans his room.  Like picking up his dirty clothes making sure they go to the hamper.  Puts his toys back in place.  After supper he will put his dishes in the sink.  He helps alot with my one year old as in bringing me a diaper when its time for a change little things like that.  I dont believe hes old enough to do more than that.  He likes to be read to and just talk (alot) we take him outside and let him play thats alot better than cartoons.  Not to say that a little cartoons will kill them.  They are pretty much able to make sure that they dont get hurt.  I still dont think old enough to be left unsupervised in the tub.  When punishing him he gets 1 minute of time out per year so he gets 4 mins.  Or if its really bad some toys will get taken away.

AA10939037	Usually you can take a test about 10-14 days after ovulation, but sometimes it may take longer. Or you could wait until about a week after a missed period. Just an FYI...if you aren't getting pregnant, I would recommend buying an ovulation test. My husband and I had been ttc for about a year and finally figured out that I wasn't ovulating in the normal time range. Good luck!
wBpennsMaa	Totally normal! The fluid that is coming out is called colostrum (pre-milk.)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Totally normal. Your body is gearing up for breastfeeding. I know it seems early but that is TOTALLY normal. I started leaking at 3 months with my first.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	yes this is normal it means you got your colostrum in already when i was about 21 weeks I woke up and my whole sheet was wet I was pretty embarrassed my husband is like what is that lol|`|VT24zOomaa	yep, it's happened to me a few times throughout pregnancy. around 20 weeks is when it started. it's kinda gross, but mine comes and goes, sometimes a lot, and sometimes hardly anything.    your body is just getting ready!|`|bTlhBX3daa	Yes, it's normal. I started leaking about that time also. It is just colostrum at this point. When the baby comes, he/she will feed on the colostrum for a couple days (which is great for their development) before the milk comes in.     One reason for the leaking is if your nipples get stimulated. You might find that sleeping in a sports bra will help, as loose clothing tends to rub. Also, it wouldn't hurt to have some nursing pads on hand just in case. If you leak a lot, you will want to wear them during the day so you don't leak and cause yourself embarassment.     Just another one of the joys of pregnancy.   Congratulations by the way.|`|AA10458750	haha yes that's normal...mine leaked out when I was 14 weeks they do it on & off....maybe you were having a passionate dream?!|`|OtbbKdITaa	It's normal. My spelling may be off, but it's called colostrum. It's the fluid stored in your breasts before the milk comes in (which doesn't happen until a couple days after delivery).|`|yuh7OsHDaa	its all good and normal  dont worry:)
Tc23KWgzaa	I don't know why.  Is he still on formula?  He'll be okay, even if he only drinks his bottle.  Just keep offering him tidbits of fingerfoods as tho nothing is wrong.  If you don't get uptight, he won't either, and he'll be back to eating soon.    TX Mom|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Have you tried letting him feed himself real food.    All babies eventually get sick of having someone spoon feed them and get sick of bland baby food.|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	Maybe he is ready for something besides baby food, it is possible that someone gave him a taste of mashed potatoes or something and he wants that taste again. Only reason he possibly still takes the bottle is for the sucking it, being a baby and all. Try some mashed potatoes with just a pinch of salt and butter for taste and prepare it with a bit of formula as opposed to real milk. I tried this with my babies and it worked very well. From there we progressed to soft foods like macaroni. I would also add a tea spoon or two of  mashed potatoes or baby cereal in their bottles at night to help them stay full longer, which helped me sleep better and longer. You will just maybe have to put a slightly bigger hole in the nipple of the bottle.
qXq0nmBzaa	surprisingly, it's rather pretty    Rowan is considered unisex so a really feminine first name works well.|`|0eabb6823f3dd9ff4491488ee1b5f7b9aa	9- i really like it ?|`|oIwyc5w2aa	I give it an 8.

I rate that name 9  Rowan sounds like a boy name! I rate That a 2|`|qqiVKUBpaa	I think Maia Rowen would be prettier, I think Rowen with an e just looks more feminine. But I don't really like Rowan/Rowen as a middle name with Maia, I think Rowan/Rowen would be prettier in front. So I'd have to say a 3.|`|i2RSpZ6caa	8 - very pretty!    I love Rowan for a middle name!
T7fVO1HFaa	it'll happen, but you have to play the waiting game like the rest of us.  But you're headed in the right direction by getting professional help.  Have hope, don't psyche yourself out!!|`|AA10939037	Don't give up hope, it will happen! My husband and I had been ttc for about 2 years using a donor (my husband had a vasectomy during his first marriage and it's very expensive to get it reversed!) and I was in the same boat as you. I decided to give it a rest because of the disappointment of those negative results, but then about a month later we finally got pregnant. Found out that vasectomies are not permanent in all cases! I'm due in 9 weeks, so it can happen. Keep trying and keep positive!!
xue72D76aa	You can absolutely still be pregnant.  It is best to wait to take a hpt a few days into a missed period, not before.  I know all the tests advertize about finding out earlier, blah blah, but when you read the fine print, there is a large degree of error when you test early.  Good luck and baby dust!|`|RPszYGXkaa	Yep, no need to bum just yet!  I too tested early when I was pregnant with my daughter.  They were all negative, and I believed them.  When I was two days overdue for AF, I thought I would try one more time....guess what I got my BFP!!!  The early tests don't work for everyone...don't give up hope until ugly AF rears her head.  Here's hoping she doesn't come around....BABY DUST!!!|`|QB5D0rG4aa	yes you still could be pregnant. I would wait a couple of days after your missed period to test again. good luck ! baby dust !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kT7GVOosaa	you could still be pregnant. wait and take another one after you miss your period.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I never have a positive pregnancy test until after the period was missed, even when using First Response.   And remember to use your morning's urine, not later in the day.|`|nBlSS6HUaa	Here is some info I found from babycenter.com  Q1. When can I take a pregnancy test and get an accurate result?    It's best to wait about a week after you miss your period to take a home pregnancy test. By that time, most newly pregnant women have enough human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in their urine for the tests to detect it.    Many home pregnancy tests claim to be "greater than 99 percent accurate" and imply that you can use them as early as the day you miss your period, but a study published in 2004 in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology has shown that this can be misleading.    Researchers at the University of New Mexico evaluated 18 tests and found that only one was consistently sensitive enough to detect the levels of hCG that most pregnant women were likely to have on the first day of their missed period. Most of the other tests were able to pick up about 16 percent of pregnancies at that point.    Q2. How can I get the best results from a pregnancy test?    First, check the expiration date on the test and make sure it's still good. If you've been storing the home pregnancy test anywhere that gets moist or warm (like the bathroom), it may have deteriorated, so throw it away and get a new one.    When you're ready to test, read the directions carefully because the instructions vary with different brands. For the most accurate results, take the test first thing in the morning, when your urine is most concentrated.    If the test shows a negative result and you still haven't gotten your period, wait another few days or a week and try again. Don't assume that one negative result means you're not pregnant. If you don't get your period as expected, remember that you might still be pregnant. (It's no time to go off on a drinking binge or do other things that are unsafe during pregnancy.)    Q3. Does even a faint line mean I'm pregnant?    If you see a positive result on your test, even if it's very light, chances are good that you're pregnant. For a home pregnancy test to show a positive result, your body has to be making a detectable level of hCG. You may get a faintly positive result if you're not as far along as you thought. To be sure, take another test in two or three days.    If the second positive result is more pronounced, congratulations. If the second test is completely negative, you may have had a very early miscarriage. Experts estimate that 20 to 30 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, so unfortunately this is very common.      Most pregnancy tests say that you can check results within five minutes, but a study at the University of New Mexico found that in some cases, it was necessary to wait ten minutes for a positive result.      Confused about our timing? We begin our pregnancy calculations from the first day of your last period, as most healthcare practitioners do. So by the time you miss your period and test positive on a pregnancy test, you're probably four or five weeks pregnant.         We have been TTC since April 2008. And we had 2 miscarriages. 11-12-08 and 12-12-08 both natural.  And I am currently waiting to see my DR on Thursday to see if I am pregnant this time. It has been 30 days since my last cycle. And I have no sighn of starting! But I do have some pregnancy symptoms. So I guess I will see on thursday!    Please pray for me...and hopefully my baby!!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Dont lose hope!! It was probably just too soon, there is still a good chance that you are pregnant. Wait until you are at least a few days late to test just to be sure. Good luck and i hope you get your bfp!|`|lMNK48Heaa	Yes, it really is too early.  The first time I got pregnant I tested 3 days before my period was due.  Then I tested the day I was due to start and got a positive.  Don't get bummed!  I was due to start today, but I haven't yet, but feel like I am going to.  I took a test Sunday and got a negative, but I still have hope.  Good luck to you.    BTW, if you read the insert for the test, it actually will say 4 days, even though the box says 5 days.  It is also only 50-60% effective that early.|`|G2ULVLbCaa	don't panic yet. Wait until your period really is due and then if it doesn't show take another one.      The best advice i can give is to not stress over it...just find something fun to entertain yourself these next few days.
etTfgJyvaa	You could have, unfortunately you probably will never know!<br>  If you want a baby just keep trying, if you have any more issues see your doctor!|`|ELzTIqiqaa	It's possible. Talk to a doctor about that. They might could do some tests to find out for sure.|`|68835352539b4ee15103e4c100c437f7aa	It could be possible that you had a miscarriage. Since you had three weeks of bleeding maybe you should contact your doctor to see if everything if ok...especially if you are trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
2E7wovNNaa	I understand your pain, I've been there.  Your child watches over you as a guardian angel and will always be with you.  The stars that twinkle at night send you love and let you know that child is ok.  You'll see that child again, one day.  Don't forget to allow yourself to be emotional today and embrace what you feel.  Don't judge.  You are ok and a lot of woman understand what you are feeling.  You are not alone.  :)|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I'm not sure if this is what you want to hear or if your religious or not, but I'm not sure anything could really make you smile. Don't think about your child dying he/she went to go live a life of no pain with Jesus. He/She is probably looking down on you wanting you to smile.

o8OTk6xYaa	They don't have a name.  There are normally two umbilical arteries and an umbilical vein supported by loose gelatinous tissue called Wharton's Jelly.  Go to any high-verbage medical site, and none of them "name" the arteries or vein.|`|WOyCgGYGaa	There are two arteries and one vein that make up the umbilical cord...hope that helps!|`|l4elu5ewaa	I don't know that there are specific names for them but they are all blood vessels rather than tubes. One carries oxygen and nutrient rich blood from the placenta to the fetus. The other two carry blood filled with waste products from the baby back to the placenta and after being filtered are returned back to mother's blood to dispose of the waste. Hope this helps.

ILIep3tVaa	Hate to tell ya, but its far, far better to be overweight than underweight!!!!<br>  I have 2 and all of my complications were a result of toxemia and/or the baby wrapping - in this case - himself up in the umbilical cord. I'm bigger than you! It wouldn't hurt to start slowly walking or other light exercise (with your doc's approval). <br>  There are many overweight women who have had babies with NO complications and skinny-minnies who have had major complications. <br>  I know a girl who is over 100 lbs overweight. She just had #5 and no problems with ANY of them!<br>  Good luck!|`|EvlZc0BPaa	with my first three pregnancies i was about 60 pounds overweight. they told me because of this i only needed to gain 15-25 pounds. i ended up losing 15 the first month due to sickness in all of my pregnancies and with my first two only ended up gaining 15 pounds, the third one i had twins and i gained 25. i was at my pre pregnancy weight the day i had all of my babies. i had no problems due to this. anyway i lost the 60 pounds before i got pregnant this time, the only thing i've noticed is i am gaining faster. so that is frustrating!!!!<br>  <br>  just watch what you eat, watch your portion sizes, get plenty of exercise and you will be okay!|`|yWUHnskAaa	Just be sensible...i was a little chubby before pregnancy and then i gained 40 lbs during pregnancy...my dr never said anything about my weight to me ....I would just watch your weight and drink plenty of water... My pregnancy went smoothly...i am having difficultly loosing the last bit of weight though and i think that is my only major problem!!|`|AA11046049	I am 35 and 80 pounds over weight and I am 14 weeks. Ill tell you I have had no problems this pregnancy...its like I was not even pregnant. So every pregnancy that you will have overweight or not is different. <br>  <br>  since you have the weight you might want to ask if you should see a Hish Risk ob. I do for other reasons and my weight is never an issue.|`|d7LpdFluaa	yes, I'm over wieght, and 27 weeks pregnant w/2nd pregnancy.  my first I had gestational diabetes at 32 weeks.  I wasn't over wieght then, but now I have ges. diab. again already.  I think that really is your biggest concern really.  and high blood preasure.  I find that I do a lot of walking.  and I havn't gained a pound.  I even lost 25 pounds in my first trimester b/c I was so sick.  you might even loose too.  if your concerned a lot, your doc might have you talk to a dietition soon, or have you tested early for diabetes.  if you are looking for more info or advice, you can email me any time and ask anything.  I'll be glad to answer:)  congrats!|`|gAqho7EXaa	Walk daily, and you will be fine. This excercise is good for you and the baby.|`|wcQeyt4laa	Well to be honest, i am quite a bit overweight to begin with, always have been. I have not had any symptoms through this pregnancy, the baby is fine and healthy. I am 17 and a half weeks and everything is fine. I found out through my blood work that i have a thyroid problem (which could explain why i've always been overweight, my thyroid doesn't work, so even when i don't eat anything, i still gained weight. Go figure.) I've gained 5 lbs only this far during the pregnancy. Anyway...now i am on medicine to control it my thyroid, but my Blood Pressure is fine and everything else is fine. I am not high risk because i am overweight. Everything is fine so far and hopefully i am being super careful because i had a miscarriage last year, so we're taking precautions. But no, as long as you take care of yourself, you should be fine. Good luck! :)|`|V5u5TxmUaa	im 20wks pregnant and bout 100lbs overweight.  i have had no complications.  i have gained probably bout 10lbs so far and nothing has happened.  i think that the worst thing might be that it might take awhile for you to feel the baby move.  that is my problem.  i felt the baby move a couple of weeks ago, and nothing since.   i read somewhere that if you are overweight its a little harder to feel the baby kick early.  just try to watch what you eat and go for walks.  and if your doctor doesnt have a problem with it, neither should you.  enjoy pregnancy.  remember that every woman is different and every pregnancy is different.|`|c69b8f538cfcde5fdb6fb6e0b17ea8caaa	that much wieght could be bad but i lost 20 lbs from pregnacy.  that by throwing up every day for 9 months, not on purpose i wish i could have stopped|`|hAbIAE6Laa	As much as I hate to admit it I started this pregnancy at about 220lbs (gulp) Yeah I'm over weight too lol. Right now I am 33 weeks and weigh 228. So I haven't gained that much. I was also very sick in the 1st trimester and ended up losing 10lbs so I just put back on 8 of the 10 I lost. My doctor says my weight gain is fine because of my size.  As for problems this is my second child and I have always been told the 2nd time around is harder then the 1st. My legs hurt a lot because of RLS (restless leg syndrome) My feet hurt too. My hips hurt a a lot too. Now I don't know if it's just because of the pregnancy or because of the extra weight I have carried. As for high risk not me. I had a few minor problems with the baby though none were related to being over weight. But they ended up fixing them selves up so no more worries.
Sa2WNGe9aa	She shouldn't really need the feedings in the middle of the night anymore, but she might want the comfort and be used to eating.  One trick I learned is to let her start suckling but at the first sign that she is drifting off break the suction with your finger.  Using this for a few nights, you might be able to limit her and it will help decrease your milk supply, too.<br>  <br>  You should also cut out the bedtime nursing.  Incorporate a bedtime snack at the table followed by a sippy cup of warm milk while sitting on your lap somewhere other than where you usually nurse her.  Then when she gets tired, take her to bed.  She might cry a little bit, and if the fussing is too much you can try letting her have a little sip from the breast but not a full nursing session.<br>  <br>  Other than that you might just have to let her cry it out a bit.  I know it's hard, especially when you don't want to disturb other people who are trying to sleep.  You may have to sleep with her in another room until she gets used to being weaned.<br>  <br>  I assume that she is using a sippy cup during the day.  Be sure she is getting plenty of liquids that way.  If she doesn't like cold milk, try warming it up or mixing in a bit strawberry.<br>   syrup.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3zeiddmwaa	I'm dealing with the same problem and I just had a thought while reading your question. What if you tried eating a lot of spicy food? It might change the taste and put her off it. I know mine is doing it for comfort, not hunger, because he will fall asleep in seconds once the breast is in his mouth.<br>  <br>  Yum, I'm off to get some Indian for dinner....|`|553SJaxRaa	I started making the bottle nipples a bit bigger and then gave her the nuby brand sippy cups. THose are so much like the bottle. Also at walmart you can get this bottle with a sippy type nipple. good luck.|`|TLZl4aX8aa	I hear you on the living situation.  That how I was with my second too.  And she hated the idea of having to use a sippy.  She would steal her older brother's but wouldn't use her own.  This is what I did...<br>  I went and got the softer nipple sippys.  Then I would offer her one every day for every feeding.  If she refused I would offer again.  If she refused then I would give her a bottle.  Then the next time I would do that again.  After about a week of that then I took away her bottle all together.  She hated me at first but I promise you she got thirsty and would take whatever I gave her.  Now she drinks out of a cup just fine.  You just have to put your foot down and realize that she will do what she can to go without using a cup.  You just have to be firm.  And it really doesn't take long for her to get that the cup has great milk in there too.  Just be patient and consistent.|`|eQZ5UNSaaa	There should come a time shortly, a window, where she will be less interested in it. Keep an eye out for it. My kids usually had that window around 11 and 14 months, where there is sometimes alot going on, so they are distracted more.. But, with one of them, I had to take a weekend, and just give him to Daddy and let Daddy give him the bottle.. He cried and cried, but it worked..Took the weekend to do it. If you live in an apartment, just warn your neighbors. That's what I used to do..Good luck!|`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	damn....just lost my answer.<br>  <br>  I hear you. My little girl nursed to 3...BUT we cut down a LOT at just over one.<br>  <br>  We left the last pre-bed nursing until last. It was a really important part of the day for her. <br>  I broke the waking up for a nurse habit and it was HARD.<br>  After she nursed before bed I covered up my breasts. I put band-aids over my nipples and told her they were ouchy. (other people just make sure shirts are tucked in and wear bras)<br>  I offered her a sippy cup on the off chance she was thirsty (which she batted away in a rage). <br>  She cried....but I didn`t leave her to cry. I cuddled and rocked her until she calmed down and went to sleep. <br>  <br>  I continued that for a few nights and she improved pretty quickly (though the first few nights were not fun). It didn`t take long before she generally wasn`t waking up.and if she did wake up she went back to sleep very quickly.<br>  <br>  With the last nursing before bed I used the 10 count system where she can only nurse for a count of ten. You start VERY slowly so she will definitely be finished or close to. Gradually you speed up the count. By the end I was saying it really fast.<br>  <br>  My little one was much older when she finally dropped this one nurse so she actually eventually gave it up for a book.
etTfgJyvaa	i went from 3 cm to fully dialated in 3 hrs|`|nIYUkb7baa	Personal experiance has taught me that you can dilate in seconds!! I went from 3cm to giving birth in 20 mins with my first, then from 5cm to giving birth in 12 mins with my second. There was a lady on here a few days ago who was saying she had been in labor at the hospital and dilated to 3, then things stopped, and they told her that she had gone back to the way she was before, not even a fingertip! So yes I guess you can stop.|`|KebBwKYDaa	I went from 0 cm dilation to holding my newborn baby in less than 4 hours!to answer the secon part of your question- yes, your body can stall on dilation at any point, especially if it is happening prior to labor.

There are also some other simple blood test you can have done to check ovulation and hormone levels (progesterone and prolactin.)   Also, if you have had a change in diet or exercise, it can cause you to have funky periods.  Good Luck!
o8OTk6xYaa	Oh yeah!  There are test kits you can buy, but I recommend starting with learning your body's cycle.  Natural Family Planning books explain this well (check your local library, internet for classes, or read The Art of Natural Family Planning).<br>  <br>  There are 4 things to watch:<br>  <br>  14 days from the start of your last period (You are fertile 9-15 days after the start of your period, as sperm can live up to 5 days in your body.  Refrain from sex at least 3 days before the start of your fertile period).<br>  <br>  Elevated temperature (the best way to know this is if you have been tracking it for at least 2 weeks)<br>  <br>  By feeling your cervix (it will be long and closed when not fertile, and shorter and open when you are) While you are doing this, retain some of your mucous and test it by:<br>  <br>  Changes in your mucous (stretch it between two fingers -- if it is stringy, you are fertile -- if watery, you are not) When it is stringy, your body is trying to hold onto the sperm.<br>  <br>  Don't mean to sound so technical (or gross), but this is just the way things are!|`|PxJpyHYTaa	Most of the time it takes a women 6 months to a year before she can get pregnant.  You need to just keep trying and have fun doing it.<br>  <br>  Most doctors will not check for infertileity until you have been trying for at least a year or 6 months if you are 35 or older. <br>  <br>  You can try tracking your ovulation and basil temp.  Also try staying in bed with your hips up for at least 20 minuets after sex.  Also only have sex every other day when it is your fertil time.  The missionary position is usual the best but others will work too.  I have listed some sites that might help you with any other question you might have.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes and Baby Dust.|`|2391473d00c29c73fd7237bba57427e5aa	I would really recommend the book <br>  Taking Charge of Your Fertility By Toni Weschler to any one trying to get pregnant; it is wonderful in helping understand your cycles and when your ovulating.|`|EHmLgpr6aa	Charting your cervical mucus can also be a good indicator. Check out www.fertilityfriend.com<br>  <br>  For example, egg white cervical mucus (discharge resembling an egg white in consistency is the most fertile)|`|iwtetdBoaa	for me it took 2 mos to get pregant- what i did was  have sex  dont get out of the bed- stay in bed relax-  and put ur legs in the air for 15 mins with a pillow under ur booty lol worked for me....try that   - when u are fertle try a ovu test for a doller at the doller store..... good luck girl|`|mh773Hqsaa	4 months is still not a long time...I would see a doctor after a full year or more if it still hasn't happened.  I would also remain positive and hopeful that you will become pregnant.  Easy, less expensive ways to help you determine when you are most fertile include using ovulation prediction kits from the drugstore...they also sell male fertility kits.  If you find your ovulation kit shows a positive, thats a good start.  Again see your doctor after a year.  A good book i used is "getting pregnant."

But it is normal, no need to worry, the doctor knows what he/she is talking about and will let you know if something is wrong.|`|Fn2TvUZvaa	In my experience the baby's fine.  I have five children.  Everyone is different.  I got huge with all mine but my mother was so tiny the entire time she was pregnant with me.  no-one really ever knew she was pregnant.  So try not to worry that's not good for the baby.  Just think positive i'm sure it'll be just fine.|`|PRQnnSuVaa	Dont worry! All the doctors have their own "weight gain" standards. As long as baby is fine and growing ( which they can tell with U/S) I wouldnt worry. I lost 20 lbs with my firdt pregnancy. I ate like crazy but kept losing weight. My doc stayed on me the entire pregnancy but my baby was fine. The stress about gaining weight is worse. So just chill. Itll be ok!
616434493dd6cd3f3c290abde6cdf661aa	They count from LMP. Don't be too worried about the miscalculation... that's all it is - a calculation based on the exact length they measure. One millimeter slip when they click the mouse can skew your measurement.  <br>  <br>  They quoted me 6 weeks when I was 8 and then later, the measurement was within a day of what it should be.  As you get further along, the date will become more accurate.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|S6N7hatNaa	Don't worry about it to much this early on. They can only measure so much crown-rump and as your get further along (like 24 weeks) they willbe able to better guess where you are at and your baby is at. By that time, he/she should weigh about a pound or so. <br>  For me, I'm 24 weeks today and my baby is already 1lb 6oz and measuring at 25.5 weeks! So, in the beginning, the size really isn't a big factor. They really just look at it to make sure all internal and extreal things that should be there at that time, are in fact there. <br>  So, don't put to much thought into it. :)<br>  Hope this helped a little!!|`|etTfgJyvaa	If you are 8 weeks pregnant you should have a 6 week foetus, silly isnt it!

Aloe vera gel is know to be a very powerful herb in maintaining the sugar level.It is 100% natural and organic. Give it a try.<br>  The weight lot program last for 7 days and it goes like this:<br>  You should use  Artic see omega 3.  Take 2 omega3 with the meal twice a day and drink one quoter of aloe veral gel tree times a day. I did this treatment and last 12 lbs in 7 days. In the mean time you should only eat vegetables and fruits. That's a hard part but if you survive you will benifit a lot. This company is the bigest producer of omega 3 and aloe vera gel in the world. Omega 3  brakes down the fet cells and melts it. They are also the best producers of aloe vera which is known to have over 200 nutriance. ( vitamis, minerals, amino acids) You don't need any multy vitamin or a diet pill that they sell  in the drug store.Those really don't work. Nature made everything in one very powerfull plant. Your body will be stisfied and you will not crave a lot of food any more after trying aloe. I garantee you. The most important thing is to drink half a glas of aloe first thing in the morning, and than continue for two more times during the day for seven days.You need to drink a lot of water during that time. All togheter you will need 3 bottles of aloe vera gel and 1 bottle of artic see omega 3.Give it a shoot.<br>  Source(s):<br>  www.foreverliving.com<br>  id# 200001179116

KlK5yHF5aa	I'm 22 weeks with my first and I've found that anything goes in that first trimester!  Here's some coping tips:<br>  <br>  1. Watch what you eat.  Is there something you've been eating before you get sick that doesn't agree with you?  It doesn't matter if it didn't upset you in the past.  Like I said, anything goes.  I LOVE pizza, but it really messed me up and I simply ('sigh') had to avoid it.  So avoid foods that aggravate your symptoms.  Believe it or not, you CAN help an upset stomach by avoiding certain foods.  Some major culprits could be fried foods (anything greasy), cheese or dairy, sugar, some veges (broccoli in particular can be bad), carbonated drinks or especially fatty foods.  An overload of any of things could send anyone rushing to the bathroom.  <br>  <br>  2. Load up on whole grains.  I got so sick of being sick that for a while all I could stomach was cold cereal.  I discovered that it actually made me feel better.  Whole grains make everything move a little faster.  Unlike fatty foods, they won't sit in your stomach and stagnate, causing an upset stomach.  Try cereals like Wheaties, Frosted Mini-Wheats or Wheat Chex.  I eat it for breakfast and a snack and it's made a world of difference.  It's fast food without the fat (or cost!).  Also, there's lots of nutrients and minerals in cereal--very good for you!<br>  <br>  3. Tums are your friends.  Your "upset stomach" could simply be a case of heartburn, which is almost a requirement of pregnancy.  Tums work fast and are mild.  Not to mention they contain tons of calcium, which we need.  In my experience, ginger didn't help me any.  In fact, someone told me to try ginger ale, and that only made things worse.  But to each her own . . .<br>  <br>  4. Exercise.  Talk a little walk after dinner when you suspect tummy troubles are on the way.  It gets your blood pumping to places other than your stomach and can take your mind off it.  Not to mention it can get your digestive system moving.<br>  <br>  5. If nothing else, rest.  Try not to stress.  Just know this won't last forever.  Hold on tight and remember that your body is creating life--it's a rough job.  Go easy on yourself.<br>  <br>  Man, I'm sorry you feel bad.  I can sympathize somewhat, although our bodies are all different.  Oh, and if some old bat tells you, "Oh just wait until you're nine months, etc.) slap them in the face for me.  Hope I helped and hey, CONGRATULATIONS!|`|33b14b7e99d6f8aaa409f58b9bf4fc61aa	i had an upset stomach in early pregnancy to. i aslso had morning sickness.l i think u just have to wait til it passes. your body changes so much in pregnancy and the high levels of hormones will affect you to.|`|DqoA3K7taa	Yep thats morning sickness, i was exactly the same whilst pregnant with my son, felt sick but was very rarely sick.<br>  <br>  Congratulations x|`|etTfgJyvaa	This is what I had when I wa pregnant with my son, I was only sick twice through the whole pregnancy but I had nausea for the first 12 weeks non-stop, but don't worry it should clear up by the end of the first trimester if not sooner! Ginger helps!|`|EgZz6EK9aa	thats how morning sickness is|`|abU5xi0iaa	yep, plays all sorts of tricks on you! i thought i was bloated and constipated but turned out to be 5 weeks gone. that was the only symptom i had...just eat healthily and keep up the veg and fruit and enjoy the ride!|`|26SqFq6Iaa	its part of the morning/night/or all day sickness. its normal|`|qgJDdCiHaa	Oh yeah....my actually first symptoms of being pregnant EVERY time is diarrhea and nausea. If I didn't know I was pregnant I usually thought I just had a stomach virus...which you get used to with little kids around the house. It'll usually fade, for me at least, by like week 6-8 so hopefully you won't suffer too much longer.
fcjlz3bXaa	i think with all the popping of pills you may have just screwed up your cycle. its too soon to tell if you're pregnant. wait a couple weeks and test if you're nervous. or use protection next time and avoid being tense about it in the first place.|`|etTfgJyvaa	Everything you've taken will have really messed up your cycle, give it a couple of weeks if still no period take a test!|`|55edfed2dbe8b9bfbaa4b58856967831aa	tension can also stop your flow. and yes you can b  pregnant go down to the clinic and take a blood test.God bless.|`|9eee6931ca4d12e686e82a5b1ed17edbaa	My advice: Less poppin'
AA12227720	Yes it has.  You won't get a postive test unless it has.  It happens about 8 - 10 days after the egg is fertilized.  So sometime about last week or even a few days ago for you.  It's really strange that you are actually concidered pregnant when you are not yet.  Although you ARE 4 weeks,  Your baby has been developing for only about 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy!!!|`|CkzY5TzQaa	2 weeks after fertilization.  Yes, it already happend. It happend your second week.|`|NdeEqubRaa	YES,it is implanted into the  endometriumof the anterir or posterior wall of the body of fundus of the uterus within a wk.implantation occur through four stages eg;apposition, adhesion, penetration, invasion.|`|UH35t6Y2aa	It happens about two weeks after conception, and sometimes causes spotting. This spotting will usually be light and kind of a brown color, nothing to worry about.  (Bleeding in the first trimester is common, only bright red blood is cause for high concern.)|`|etTfgJyvaa	I think its some thing like 4-10 days from conception so yest i would have already happened!!|`|eQZ5UNSaaa	yup.. It takes probably no more than a week...tops
pgCE81FQaa	The vast majority of women go on to conceive after a miscarriage with no problems.   <br>  <br>      * It is recommended, though, that you wait anywhere from one to three months after miscarrying before you conceive again.<br>  <br>      * Even if you are physically ready to conceive, you may not be emotionally ready. Take your time and grieve if that's what feels right for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|26SqFq6Iaa	i wouldn't try to have another one yet after a couple weeks. Best I'd wait until 6 mos - 12 mos to try again.|`|9da4d70041b61bade51eb02559d7d038aa	This really depends on the person and the medical reason for their miscarriage. Most miscarriages are just spontaneous and no one knows why. Most of these women are able to go on and carry another baby to full term. Some miscarriages are due to physical problems the mother may need to address before conceiving again such as blood type, tube pregnancy, etc.etc. <br>  No one can tell you that a pregnancy will or will not carry to full term, or is safe.<br>  Your Dr. knows your body and medical history. He/She can tell you specifically what you can do to have the greatest chance of carrying a healthy baby to term.|`|BkDwgC9eaa	my doctor had said to me, i should wait 2 months and then i could try again. ask your doctor to be sure|`|CTwTFLmUaa	I think it depends on how far along you were when you lost the pregnancy.  I lost a pregnancy at 5 months and my Dr advised me not to get pregnant fofr a couple months.  Then I lost one a week after I found out I was pregnant.  My Dr termed it a "Chemical Pregnancy" and she said to just consider as my period and keep trying.  So If you're somewhere in between there, the best advice will come from your Dr.|`|etTfgJyvaa	Depends on the situation, speak to your doctor!|`|AA11471470	yes bcuz u try again|`|Lp4WAtAQaa	Yes, it happens all the time.  And it seems to help the mom's mental state to be carrying the next baby. It helps her get over the sadness of the one she lost.|`|MBqPCYzaaa	Yes it's safe. My wife had two miscarriages in three months. Then immediately after that we found out she was pregnant again. This time a wonderfully health boy.|`|NVE78F6Faa	it depends on the  situation.  you need to contact your doctor about that.|`|wtLKS3hBaa	Each situation is different, I can only say that I assume so.<br>  <br>  I miscarried at 15 weeks 10th Jan last year; noone knows exactly when I conceived again due to lack of periods but my daughter was due on the 12 th November; 43 weeks 5 days after my miscarriage. I didn't plan to conceive again so soon, in fact was back on birth control and didn't find out I had until 22 weeks gone. My daughter was born perfectly healthy and is now 6 months old.<br>  <br>  It doesn't answer your question because there are too many ifs buts and maybes; but most of the time in simple spontaneous miscarriage, the woman doesn't go on to suffer any complications with future pregnancies no matter how soon they occur.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps you.
bbe04cc8f7e140928de11ccab01dd722aa	quit having sex.  If you are having abortions it is because you don't want a baby yet.  Guess what causes pregnancy? SEX!!!!!!!!!  Start using birth control AND condoms or try something called celibacy (no sex at all).|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	you do realize that you are suppose to wait at least two weeks after you have an abortion to have sex again.?  Didn't your doctor tell you that.?<br>  <br>  You should have started having a period once you had the abortion or something close to a period.  <br>  <br>  Is the bleeding heavier then usual when you have a period.? Are you in any pain.?   If yes, then you need to see someone.  <br>  <br>  How about you stop  having sex for at least a month and let you body relax.  It wont kill you..|`|NbjYOULjaa	You need to go to the doctor ASAP! Run, Quick, Go to the emergency room! You may have an infection or fragments of the fetus may not have come out of you. You should hurry or else you may become sterile, as in not be able to have kids. So, go on run, drive, call the ambulance as soon as you get this response.|`|2Cpgm9rraa	i would call my doctor ASAP!!!|`|2pT5IL7Caa	after abortion. you will still have you regular mens. if you are worry call your doc.|`|f5d8540b70eef50dbad4a7d2eff7348aaa	How long did you wait to have sex?|`|ztpRHo49aa	Well...prolly means you just killed the next messiah....thanks...
6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	It's possible you are pregnant. It's also possible you might have experienced a really early miscarriage, which might explain the negative test results after getting a positive.<br>  <br>  You could get a blood test to be sure.|`|IBgnIfHHaa	Go to the doctor|`|1274187c3126117cd5159e53fc44c3c5aa	A symptom of pregnancy is implantation bleeding when the embryo implants in the uterus, around five to ten days after conception. Implantation bleeding is usually light to medium pink in color (not red, like a period) and is spotty. So it is possible that you're pregnant.|`|etTfgJyvaa	I'm sorry to say it sounds like it could have been an early miscarriage! See your doctor NOW!
244251ad5ee9bb9d0b3b9df8ef35f5a2aa	Sounds like braxton hicks....if you get up and move around and the cramping subsides its false labor just your body getting ready.  If the pain does not go away or insensifies my moving you could be beginning to have contractions.  Some women have contractions for weeks before going fully into labor.  Discuss it with your ob at your next visit they will probably want to check your cervix which is the only accurate way to ascertain if you may be in labor.|`|etTfgJyvaa	It is probably just that you can feel your babies head in your pelvis!
66d221d2d458f675c0f7e4bc024fd417aa	about 1 month and 3 weeks. CONGRATS!!!!|`|AA11735904	Weeks is determined by the date of your last period not the date you actually conceived. Yes, it can be confusing but if you count from the date of your last period (probably around 2 weeks before April 1st??) to now that will give you the number of weeks. A pregnancy is 40 weeks from the date of your LMP.|`|etTfgJyvaa	your 11 weeks<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/pregnancy_calendar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/parenting/pregnancy...</a><br>  <br>  congratulations!
VIyzcaNlaa	very normal... a lot of ladies don't even figure out they are expecting until 12-16 weeks along because it feels like normal period pains|`|b20ca9d605e92706a3c109f997d04674aa	Yes, it is normal (as long as you aren't spotting).  I had mild cramping early on in both pregnancies.  Your uterus is growing.|`|etTfgJyvaa	Thats perfectly normal hunni!|`|AA11276415	Yes, it's normal and spotting can be normal too. The spotting would be implantation bleeding....if you are bleeding heavily call your doctor (just incase you start bleeding)|`|HD7P1lhfaa	it's normal.if you can't manage your son these days keep somebody for help.congragulations!!!!!!!!!!!
d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	want to say...MathewsMommy{s answer is spot on. I used all those things to cut down on nursing and (much later) to wean completely.<br>  Cutting down on nursing really helped increase the amount of food my daughter ate.<br>  <br>  To add...I really suggest you contact your local La Leche League group<br>  <br>  Things she can feed herself......my little one only wanted to feed herself too. I gave her  large chunks of banana and very soft fruit to suck and munch on. My daughter didn`t have any problems with choking so I also gave her pieces of bread, avocardo, steamed vegies, small pieces of pasta and noodles, little tiny rice balls.|`|8ISnDPziaa	Keep the tittie in the bra. When she cries, give her food. If she won;t take it, wait a bit and try again.<br>  <br>  Remember, You are the mamma, and in charge. Not her.|`|AA11431597	I got mine used to solids by using toddler formula or the Enfamil AR formula (for acid reflux) and adding a scoop of rice cereal to it, to make it a bit thicker.  I eventually would add one scoop for each 2 oz of formula, to help his tummy get used to it,and it worked.  They soy formula isn't that tasty.  If she isn't still allergic to dairy, you can do 1/2 AR or toddler formula and 1/2 soy formula.  I mixed it like that for a long time.  My son also loves vanilla or regular soy milk.|`|CFCKW1WMaa	Maybe she has acid reflux.  Docs can give you scripts for that and it will help, but if she won't eat and they won't do anything then get a second opinion. Also, they have soy milk, try that and try different nipples or sippy cups since she is a bit older to see which one she likes best.|`|VO8IDQ98aa	tell her they're all gone and just stop! she's old enough to understand that much. and she will not starve, she'll eat when she gets hungry enough.|`|aZdz2eyvaa	There are a few weaning methods to use with a toddler. 1 is don't ask don't refuse- this 1 you don't offer to nurse, but if they ask you nurse them. 2. Cut down the # of nursing sessions by 1 every few days. This helps so that you don't get mastitis or clogged ducts from a dramatic decrease in nursing. 3. You can tell her that there is no more milk or that they are broken and put bandaids on them (I've heard this works with some toddlers). <br>  As far as the solids go, maybe soft solids. They have mashed potatos without milk in them that can be prepared with soy or rice milk. <br>  Have you tried flat soft spout sippy's? There are only 3 that I have found. Gerber comfort hold transition cup, Nuby, and avent magic sippy. Those are the only ones my son will drink from.<br>  Good luck!|`|xjPG9kmraa	Try her on the soy based milks.  My granddaughter loves the Silk brand (No dairy products).  Even if she has a milk allergy she may be able to tolerate fat free yogurt products (don't try without talking to your doctor).  <br>   To wean her, I assume she can drink from a cup?  Refuse to give her the breast.  It will not hurt her and will make her unhappy for a while, just keep explaining that she is a big girl and big girls drink from cups.  Don't give in, she will expect you to. Be patient, be consistent, if necessary leave her with her someone and take a 20 minute break.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	This is a hard one.  Does she take a cup or bottle?<br>  What have the doctors advised  you to feed her?<br>  I'd try fruit smoothies in a cup.  And let them gradually get thicker.  Soups.
e8Hzuro9aa	If you don't want the baby why not try for an open adoption there is so many people that wants to have a baby and can't and with an open adoption you will still be able to see how the baby is doing. Some familes will even take you in till you have the baby. Good luck Honey|`|b9532c7fa197923180e586a568d84295aa	If you are pregnant , you must consider it a big reward. it really is . there are thousands or millions of women who try all their lives to have a baby and they just can't . if your baby is going to be born, it 's because he o she has a especial mission , and even if you don'r understand it now. you will in the future. why do you say your family won't help you? first  let them know about it because you are thinking in advance..there are many possibilities for you and your baby. . you are a blessed  girl. , just think about it.|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	If those are the two choices, then I would certainly abort.  I know that some people won't like that answer, but that's where I stand on the issue.|`|3a79b51cda6182933b2e1318c9e4fb1baa	I'll tell you what I've told many girls I've known in real life and in your situation...do what's right for you. Not for mom, dad, boyfriend...but for you. There is no "right choice" one size fits all for every person.  For some it may be to give it up, for others to keep, and yes, still others the right choice for them is to abort.  I don't think you would regret the decision to keep a child...you may have to seek financial help and resources elsewhere and it will not be an easy path...but my lord, children are worth all the blood sweat and tears you put into them.  Again, it's completely your decision, so make it a careful one.|`|8d2b4311f2fe2d187e4fffd77d2d27bfaa	Please dont choose abortion!

I wish you the best of luck!|`|SdpwWxDxaa	Call a good adoption/counseling agency.<br>  <br>  That eternal law that you are to have no sexual relations except with your spouse, to whom you are legally and lawfully wedded, was given so that you might have peace of mind.

Give the gift of adoption. Your baby will get the chance of a complete family and you will make a childless couple very happy. How unselfish and loving is that? I thank my biological mom (in my heart) every day for giving me up to a very good family, and a chance at a great life. She was a single/unmarried woman who could not take care of me. She had no job and no money. But she had a big heart. Think it over honey.

Please do not abort your living child!  Adoption, is a great option.

The love for your unborn child to give it a better life.  I really hope that you choose adoption.  God Bless and Good Luck.|`|MCndkkCTaa	Your parents have a legal responsibility to take care of you and make sure you get medical attention.  <br>  If they can't, or won't do this, there may be help for you from several different government agencies.  <br>  Personally, I would try to patch things up with the father, but that's all up to you.  <br>  If you need any help, with anything, planned parenthood is a fabulous resource.  They have discounted medical care, information and counselors.  Something as simple as a phone call could change how you think about your pregnancy.  <br>  If there is any way possible to keep the pregnancy (even if you decide to give up the baby for adoption), please do.  Terminating a pregnancy is something that you could really regret for the rest of your life.  <br>  Please seek help from a counselor, priest, teacher, or a trusted family friend.|`|Oe6Zh28saa	I'm 19 and pregnant and the father of my baby ran off on me as soon as I told him. Would I change it? Heck no! would I think about aborting this innocent baby cause the man was too much of an idiot to be part of the babies life? No, not at all. I think you should have this baby and love it, its the most amazing thing in the world, how a baby is formed and all the stages it goes thru is absolutley amazing. I understand its gonna be a tight squeeze with money, but you can try getting a job. This baby is totally worth it. Its there for a reason, god wouldnt give it to you if he didnt see it fit. Best of luck and congratulations.|`|nWQ8fJTgaa	I am very sorry that you are in this situation and I will try to help out some.  If you decide not to keep the baby I would give it up for adoption.  There are so many people out there who would raise the child with love and care.  Just look in the news paper for listings.  I wouldn't worry about making a decision right now.  I would wait a little while until your heart heals some and you can think better.  This is a tough time in your life and you have a rough road ahead of you.  If you make a decision now while you are upset you may end up doing something you will regret.  Just remember God won't put any more on you than you can bare.  If he knew you could do it then you can! You have been blessed with the gift of life.  I would pray also because maybe it was ment for you to give the baby to someone who can't have a baby and you just sort of had their baby for them.  Pray and ask god for a clear mind and guidance to show you how he wants you to decide.|`|pl2cysm1aa	Ask yourself:<br>  <br>  If he had not cheated, would you still abort?  If no, then why let him rule you even after you've broken up.  That's no reason to abort, just because all of a sudden you're single.  Don't get me wrong or think that I'm lecturing because I'm Pro-Choice.  However, I think abortion should be used under different circumstances.<br>  <br>  Just because you feel like you can't do it alone or that you can't afford it, you can.  There are many young mothers out there that are making it.  Besides, you can get help from the state you live in, and the father would be required to pay child support.  You can do it if you really want to.<br>  <br>  Adoption is also a good choice.  If you are not ready to have a child, think about it.  There are families out there that are praying for a newborn.  Plus, you can get it to where you can still be a part of his life too!  <br>  <br>  Think it through.  If you do decide to abort, you should do it now, before it gets any bigger.  I'm 11 weeks and my baby is already formed, the organs are formed, the heart is beating, he/she has long arms and long legs and looked like it was doing jumping jacks in the ultrasound.|`|uHK1UiYhaa	Please not abortion. If need be do an open adoption. Where you can still keep in touch with your baby. I think once you have this child your parents will come along and eventually support you.

For this you'll need health insurance or be elligible for Medicaid or any local free health clinic. During pregnancy women aren't usually themselves. You'll have morning sickness, mood swings and a series of discomforts (this is the usual).<br>  (2) During these 9 months, you'll need a roof over your shoulders. If you're not working and have no one to support you, then you'll need to look for a job (which is difficult to get if they know you're pregnant). <br>  (3) Once you've given birth, you'll be responsible for the care of this child until he or she is an 18 year-old. <br>  (4) Having a baby at your age and without any support- like the way you claim- will limit your future because instead of focusing only on you-like most of us- you'll have a child to deprive you from an education or financial freedom.<br>  (5)  If you get a job, you'll need someone to watch him while you're working. Hence, you'll have to pay a nanny. You will need to provide a safe place, special food, diapers, clothes, and health care. <br>  (6) You may need to rent an apartment instead of a room that may be cheaper because most people with an apartment will be reluctant to rent a room to a teenager with a new born. People don't want to be disturbed with other people's babies.<br>  (7) Right now, you're unemployed, may have not enough job experience, and may not have a savings account to cover for the costs associated with having a baby. If you do have a credit card, its credit limit must be very small due to your age.<br>  (8) So far you say you don't even have a job- if you don't have enough for you- how would you be able to provide all these things to someone else?<br>  (9) Whether you like it or not, the father of the baby will have rights over him, after the baby is born. In the event that he wants to fight for custody over the baby- he has that right.<br>  (10) You'll be linked to that jerk through this baby. So you have no way to make him disappear at your will.<br>  <br>  If you decide with option B, ending your pregnancy, then you may have the following consequences:<br>  <br>  (1) You'll need the money to do just that, abort. If you decide to do this, please, find out of a safe place. Ask your doctor, but if you don't have one ask a friend to ask her doctor. Also, make sure that they do a test to confirm that you ARE in fact pregnant. A friend of mine thought she was pregnant, and she told me that she had scheduled her abortion. Fortunately, I advised my friend to go to another place suggested by my doctor, when she went she was told she was not pregnant. Remember that she had already had a date set for the abortion- so you'd better be dilligent.<br>  (2) Depending on your state, you may need parental approval.<br>  (3) After having the procedure done, you may experience minimal physical discomfort.<br>  (4) You may be sad or regretful of your decision for a short or long time. <br>  (5) You'll be able to get a job and focus on yourself. You'll time will be divided between your job and school.<br>  (6) You won't ever have to speak again to the jerk who cheated on you, unless you want to.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Your doctor should be able to tell you what is best for you. My husband and I tried IUI seven times before we opted for IVF. It was my doctor who finally convinced us to go ahead with IVF. He told me that if I didn't do it soon, then it may never happen at all. <br>  <br>  You should be thankful that your insurance is going to pay for one treatment of IVF. Mine didn't. IVF isn't as expensive as it used to be and there are several financing options available. <br>  <br>  If your doctor recommends IVF as your next round of treatment, then go ahead with it. However, your doctor will most likely have you wait a few months to get the other fertility drugs completely out of your system before proceeding with IVF.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|db1bee1992e6439478c94c69e5ad4b62aa	What does your doctor recommend? Sometimes IVF just doesn't work the 1st time. If you're covered for it again, i'd try it again. I never heard of the 'stay in bed' thing after IVF.

Anyway, this is my non expert opinion.<br>  <br>  From what you said though, your kid is very active in high risk activities that are likely to get her hurt. Add to that the fact that she is entering puberty.<br>  <br>  The importance of puberty on these injuries are at least two:<br>  1) She begins growing faster and gets clumsy.<br>  2) Her peers get more aggressive in their play (specially in sk8) and she'll tend to follow and try more radical maneuvers.<br>  <br>  The rapid growth could also mean she needs more calcium and she might not be getting as much as needed.|`|AcJ6It8kaa	Well, she should get a check up but I am not a doctor so don't take my word for it but maybe it's just what happens when you're a gymnast.

Also if you are predisposed to the conditions (such as your motherhad them when she was pregnant for you, or you had them while pregnant before) your chances are obviously much higher. <br>  Here is what webmd.com says:<br>  Who Is at Risk for Preeclampsia?<br>  Preeclampsia is most often seen in first-time pregnancies and in pregnant teens and women over 40. Other risk factors include:<br>  <br>  A history of high blood pressure prior to pregnancy. <br>  Previous history of preeclampsia. <br>  A history of preeclampsia in mother or sisters. <br>  Obesity prior to pregnancy. <br>  Carrying more than one baby. <br>  History of diabetes, kidney disease, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. <br>  <br>  Here is the full link if you would like to check it out-<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/preeclampsia-eclampsia" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/preeclam...</a>|`|26SqFq6Iaa	i think it has to do with the weight!|`|O0SDdEtraa	It is the luck of the draw..

El centro de gravedad se mueve hacia adelante y ejerce más tensión en la parte inferior de la espalda. <br>  -Presión sobre los músculos debilitados y estirados del abdomen que soportan la columna vertebral.<br>  <br>  Es normal sentir dolor de espalda siempre que no sea un dolor fuerte o agudo. éste puede ser un signo de advertencia de infecciones o complicaciones, en especial cuando viene acompa?ado de fiebre u otros síntomas.<br>  <br>  Dolor de espalda: Qué puede hacer<br>  Si sigue estos consejos, puede aliviar ligeramente el dolor normal de espalda que se siente durante el embarazo: <br>  -Postura. Preste atención a su postura. Trate de mantener las caderas hacia adelante y la espalda recta. No camine arqueando la espalda ni sacando la panza. <br>  -Calzado. Use zapatos de tacón bajo con buen apoyo en el arco del pie. Evite usar zapatos de tacón alto porque ponen presión sobre los músculos de la cintura. <br>  -Levantar objetos. Evite levantar objetos pesados porque significa aun más esfuerzo para la espalda. Si tiene que levantar algo del piso, flexione las rodillas y mantenga la espalda recta. <br>  -Agacharse y estirarse. Tenga a mano las cosas que necesita para que no deba agacharse ni estirarse para alcanzarlas. Recuerde que es más fácil perder el equilibrio cuando está embarazada. <br>  -Pararse. Evite en lo posible pasar mucho tiempo de pie. Si tiene que estar parada durante un tiempo largo, descanse un pie sobre un banquito o caja. Así aliviará la tensión en la espalda. <br>  -Sentarse. Siéntese en sillas que tengan buen apoyo para la espalda. Coloque una almohada peque?a detrás de la cintura para que tenga más apoyo cuando esté sentada. <br>  -Dormir. El mejor apoyo para la espalda es un colchón firme más que uno blando. Si su colchón es demasiado blando, coloque una tabla entre el colchón y la base. Duerma de costado en lugar de dormir boca arriba. Coloque una almohada entre las piernas cuando se acueste de costado. La almohada le ayudará a mantener recta la columna vertebral y le dará más apoyo a la espalda. <br>  -Apoyo. Use pantalones de embarazo con una banda ancha de elástico que caiga debajo de la curva de la panza. Esa banda le ayudará a sostener el peso extra. También hay fajas especiales de apoyo abdominal que le brindan ese tipo de soporte lumbar. <br>  -Alivio del dolor. Por lo general no conviene tomar medicamentos para aliviar el dolor de espalda durante el embarazo. Antes de tomar cualquier tipo de remedio, consulte con el profesional de la salud. Puede aliviar el dolor de espalda con una almohadilla térmica, una bolsa de agua caliente o compresas frías. <br>  -Ejercicios. Puede hacer algunos ejercicios para fortalecer y estirar los músculos de la espalda. Eso le ayudará a mejorar la postura y fortalecer los músculos abdominales en preparación para el parto. No olvide consultar con el profesional de la salud qué ejercicios son buenos para usted y cuánto tiempo puede mantener el programa de actividad física.|`|XZHgC7lpaa	es por el peso extra que llevas dentro... no estas acostumbrada a tanto pesoo es por esoo!|`|lXPizkd9aa	debe de ser porque tu cuerpo se esta adaptando al bebe, y preparando para su salida.<br>  Imagina q de un momento a otro empiece a crecer acelerdamente otro cuerpo en un lugar q esta dise?ado para solo los organos vitales.|`|lkGpGWyNaa	eso normalmente sucede porke el creciemiento del bebe, obviamente implica crecimiento de la barriga, entonces eso hace ke exista un peso y tu posicion se incline un poco, por eso recomiendan hacerce masajes en la espalda y tratar de colocar una mejor posicion para ke no duela mucho, ah has ejercicios eso ayuda...espero te sirva!!!!...|`|oW6YjIhaaa	Es normal el dolor de espalda en las 3 primeros meses, porque tu esqueleto y todo tu organismo se esta acomodando para dar espacio al nuevo ser que se está desarrollando dentro de tí; pero es mas dolorolos en los últimos meses por el peso del feto.<br>  Es recomendable dormir acostado de lado izquierdo para mayor comodidad del futuro bebé y evitar dolores musculares.|`|q7fivPeoaa	por el peso de la barriga y por el stres..chau besus!|`|tztogC1daa	por el peso extra de tu cuerpo, pero no te preocupes que todo vale la pena y pasa cuando tengas a tu baby en tu brazos|`|zVuGBpQLaa	Porque tienes un ser en el utero eso quieras o no tiene que tirar para delante|`|1a39b3e151b2e2755e3dfd94f46c9fe6aa	por que la columna vertebral se va acomodando de acorde al crecimiento del bebe.. en la parte del estomago se va undiendo....
74455667f124980a51403ffa72db4cd8aa	My first one was horrible, it felt like a blow torch was constantly on me after the anesthesia wore off, the second one a piece of cake, no pain, the third one was a bit painful, but I had extra pain medication....good drugs.....<br>  My first one was because my baby was breech, teh second one was b/c I had a first one and that is why I had the 3rd one too.....you have to remember it is an operation, so you have to heal afterwards.|`|hCuBMdqXaa	i had a c section with my daughter she wouldnt engage in to the pelvis and i was carrying a lot of water i was 42 weeks pregnant and they couldnt get my labour to start they said it would be safer to have a c section as bursting my waters could lead to an emergancy c section if the cord came out 1st so i had a planned c section i had a spinal block but had side effects from it and my blood pressure droped and as soon as i seen my daughter fell asleep and didnt wake up for aproximatly 6 hours later so my mum had to look after my daughter (as her father doesnt want to be involved) and i missed out on the 1st few hours of my daughters life.But i do it all over again.but the worse part was recovering after the csection its so much herder to do anything and takes longer before you can leave hospital and get in to a routine.|`|0321b0879a95ede6235c499677b58625aa	My first one was torture. It took me forever to finally walk upright. I was on pain meds constantly. My second was really easy. I was walking very fast and I hardly used any pain meds. My 3rd was okay, but recovery has been longer than my other ones. I had my 3rd c-section on june 14th and I've already torn 3 stitches.|`|39d22b21d49992d4ea9f5aa39ddf879faa	Soory but the first ew weeks were rough, but i was discharged w/o pain medication, so that explains alot. recovery took a month or so to really feel more than ok, ut it was unplanned and an emergency after 30 hours of labor. I had it rough but it was all worth it and my 2nd is due soon so i hope it goes easier. Wish me luck
o8OTk6xYaa	Since you have an irregular cycle, there is really no way to pinpoint your fertile time.  If you suspect pregnancy, I would request a blood test.  They can detect hcG in as little as 7 days from conception.<br>  <br>  Hope you get the result you want!|`|eECytyckaa	you get your period 14 days after you ovulate. the most accurate results are one week after you were supposed to get you period. also sperm can live at least 7 days do to add it all up. July 6th would be the best date.|`|qt7GI4sLaa	If you go to a doctor, you could know as soon as the results come back, as long as you get a QUANTITATIVE test result. If you get a QUALITATIVE, it only says yes or no to pregnancy hormones, and it may come back as a false negative. I found out that I was expecting both of my kids about a week after conception on home pregnancy tests, but the line was so faint that you could barely see it, and so I still wound up going to the doctor for something more definitive anyway. OB/GYN's usually make you get a blood test to make sure you didn't get a false positive on a home test before they'll treat you for anything, anyway, so it might just be best (and easiest) to go to the doctor and be sure. :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :-)
74455667f124980a51403ffa72db4cd8aa	She could be, or she could be having hormemonal issues.  But yes she could be pregnant.|`|63b1d460fc3f45c71b6d9ca6ba11088aaa	not necessarily but it's possible<br>  I was late twice this year , basically skipped 2 months... ran to the doc... she said it's normal to skip your period (stress, weather, hormones can triger it) . She said to worry if I bleed more than usual, bec that could be something serious.<br>  SO relax!!! It could be just a skippy month <br>  or<br>  a baby.<br>  Never know...|`|AD4Lo9diaa	not necessarily. alot of women get there mestral cycle late. it cud just mean that shes having problems wit hormones or something. if she gets it like a couple weeks late, get her to a doctor, she more in likely is pregnant. but she cud be pregnant, so dont give up hope yet.|`|NkiGYmiCaa	yes, but tests are 99% accurate. stress may be making her late. but 6 days is pretty late,wait another week and test. if its still negitive, then go to the doctor<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ff7271b03839a79af8a7d6c3b33993d2aa	yes, the only sure fire way is a blood test, make an appt

qkjQ4mG1aa	Gostaria muito de te responder, mas a asclara<br>  falou tudo e um pouco mais, n?o sobrou nada<br>  para mim.<br>  bjuss|`|kV1pDZynaa	Em se tratando de qualquer anticoncepcional tem que usar à partir do 1o dia da menstrua??o onde inicia cada ciclo.<br>  Se você come?ar mais adiante no ciclo, um dos oócitos já estará mais desenvolvido e provável que a medica??o n?o fa?a mais, efeito de impedir de completar sua matura??o e ovula??o, e acabar tendo fertilidade.<br>  Ou ainda, provocar forma??o de ovário policísticos, que n?o é comum em humanos.(maturar vários ao mesmo tempo) e assim que parasse iria liberar vários ao mesmo tempo. Ou desequilibrar tudo e n?o surtir mais, efeito de anticoncep??o, por alguns ciclos.<br>  <br>  Bula do Mesigyna:<br>  Composi??o <br>  cada ml contém 50 mg de enantato denoretisterona e 5 mg de valerato de estradiol em solu??o oleosa. <br>  <br>  - Posologia e Administra??o <br>  Mesigyna deve sempre ser administrada por via intramuscular profunda (de preferência na regi?o glútea, e como alternativa no bra?o). As rea??es de curta dura??o (cócegas na garganta, acessos de tosse, dispnéia ) que podem ocorrer em casos isolados, durante ou imediatamente após a inje??o intramuscular de solu??es oleosas, podem ser evitadas, conforme tem-se comprovado, administrando-se a inje??o lentamente. é recomendável cobrir a regi?o onde se administrou o produto com esparadrapo, para evitar o refluxo da solu??o. A primeira inje??o deve ser administrada no primeiro dia de um ciclo menstrual. As inje??es seguintes devem ser administradas, independentemente do padr?o menstrual, em intervalos de 30 (mais ou menos 3) dias, isto é, no mínimo 27 e no máximo 33 dias. Transcorrendo intervalos de inje??o superiores aos 33 dias, n?o se pode contar, a partir desta data, com o grau de seguran?a contraceptiva necessário. Se dentro dos 30 dias posteriores à administra??o do produto n?o ocorrer sangramento por priva??o hormonal, deve-se afastar a possibilidade de gravidez por meio de teste adequado. Uma ou duas semanas após a primeira inje??o ocorrerá sangramento vaginal. Com a continua??o do tratamento, os episódios de sangramento apresentar-se-?o geralmente em intervalos de 30 dias. O dia da inje??o mensal estará normalmente dentro do intervalo livre de sangramento. Em geral, decorridos 60 dias após a última inje??o de Mesigyna recupera-se a capacidade normal de concep??o. Entretanto, se neste período n?o se estabelecer o curso fisiológico do ciclo, é aconselhável estabelecer tratamento adequado nas mulheres que desejam engravidar. <br>  <br>  - Precau??es <br>  antes de iniciar o tratamento devem ser realizados exames clínico detalhado e ginecológico minucioso (incluindo mamas e citologia cervical), inclusive com cuidadosa anamnese familiar. Devem ser descartados distúrbios do sistema de coagula??o quando houver histórico familiar, durante a juventude, de enfermidades tromboembólicas (por exemplo, trombose  venosa profunda, apoplexia, infarto  do miocárdio). A possibilidade de haver gesta??o deve ser excluída. Durante o tratamento recomendam-se exames de controle em intervalos de aproximadamente 6 meses. Deve-se evitar a administra??o de uma nova inje??o se durante o tratamento ocorrerem, pela primeira vez, cefaléias do tipo enxaqueca  ou cefaléias com freqüência fora do habitual; perturba??es repentinas de percep??o (por exemplo, da vis?o, da audi??o); sinais precursores de tromboflebites ou tromboembolias (por exemplo, edema  ou dores habituais nas pernas, dores do tipo pontada ao respirar ou tossir, de origem desconhecida); sensa??o de dor e constri??o no tórax. Também em casos de cirurgias já planejadas (6 semanas antes da data prevista) ou imobiliza??o for?ada decorrente, por exemplo, de acidentes, a medica??o deve ser suspensa. Em todos estes casos pode existir um risco maior de trombose . S?o também raz?es para suspender a medica??o: o aparecimento de icterícia ; hepatite ; prurido  generalizado; aumento de ataques epilépticos; acentuada eleva??o da press?o arterial e gravidez. Segundo os conhecimentos atuais, n?o se pode excluir a associa??o entre o uso de contraceptivos hormonais e um aumento do risco de doen?as tromboembólicas venosas e arteriais. Com rela??o à trombose  arterial (por exemplo, apoplexia e infarto  do miocárdio) parece ocorrer aumento do risco relativo quando existem concomitantemente os seguintes fatores: consumo intenso de cigarro, idade mais avan?ada e tratamento com contraceptivos hormonais combinados. Durante o tratamento com substancias hormonais, tais como as contidas em Mesigyna, foram observadas, em casos raros, altera??es hepáticas benignas e, mais raramente altera??es malignas, que em casos isolados podem ocasionar hemorragias intra-abdominais com risco de vida para a paciente. Se ocorrerem transtornos epigástricos graves, aumento de tamanho do fígado ou sinais de hemorragia  intra-abdominal, deve-se incluir tumor  hepático nas considera??es diagnóstico-diferenciais. Pacientes com diabetes mellitus ; tendência a diabetes ; hipertens?o; varizes ; antecedentes de flebite ; otosclerose; esclerose múltipla ; epilepsia ; porfiria; tetania ou coréia menor devem ser mantidas sob cuidadosa vigilancia. Mesigyna n?o apresenta efeito inibidor sobre o mecanismo de lacta??o. Também n?o foram observados até o presente efeitos desfavoráveis sobre lactentes, embora deva ser considerado que pequenas quantidades de esteróides podem passar para o leite materno. Como ocorre com outros esteróides, existe, portanto, a possibilidade teórica, principalmente durante a primeira semana de vida do lactente, de que se modifiquem os processos de degrada??o da bilirrubina . Se o recém-nascido apresentar icterícia  neonatal de maior grau ou t?o prolongada que requeira tratamento médico, a lacta??o deve ser interrompida durante o mesmo. <br>  <br>  - Rea??es adversas <br>  durante o tratamento com Mesigyna podem ocorrer, em casos isolados, cefaléias, distúrbios gástricos, náuseas , tens?o mamária, altera??es do peso e da libido, bem como estados depressivos. Isoladamente, podem ocorrer amenorréias e sangramento por disrup??o. Na presen?a de sangramentos por disrup??o intensos, persistentes e recorrentes, que n?o desapare?am espontaneamente, o medicamento deve ser suspenso para que se exclua alguma causa organica. Após tratamentos prolongados, pode ocorrer, às vezes, cloasma em mulheres predispostas, que se acentua com a exposi??o prolongada ao sol. Recomenda-se a mulheres com esta tendência que n?o se exponham durante muito tempo aos raios solares. Tem-se observado em casos isolados, uma diminui??o da tolerancia frente a lentes de contato. <br>  <br>  - Contra-Indica??es <br>  gravidez; altera??es graves da fun??o hepática; antecedentes de icterícia  idiopática gravídica ou prurido  gestacional grave; síndrome  de Dubin-Johnson e de Rotor; tumores hepáticos atuais ou antecedentes dos mesmos; processos tromboembólicos arteriais ou venosos ou antecedentes dos mesmos, bem como condi??es que aumentem a tendência a tais enfermidades (por exemplo, distúrbios do sistema de coagula??o com tendência a trombose , determinadas cardiopatias); anemia  falciforme; carcinoma  de mama ou de endométrio , ou antecedentes dos mesmos; diabetes mellitus  grave com altera??es vasculares; transtornos do metabolismo  lipídico; antecedentes de herpes gravídico; otosclerose com agravamento durante alguma gesta??o anterior. <br>  <br>  - Indica??es <br>  contracep??o hormonal. <br>  <br>  - Apresenta??o <br>  cartucho com 1 seringa pré-carregada com 1 ml + agulha. <br>  <br>  <br>  - Laboratório<br>  <br>  Schering do Brasil <br>  Rua Cancioneiro de évora, 255/339/383 <br>  S?o Paulo/SP - CEP: 04708-010 <br>  Tel: 55 (011)536-4611 <br>  Fax: 55 (011) 536-3939 <br>  Site: <a href="http://www.schering.com.br/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schering.com.br/</a>|`|26F4bVjUaa	oi é por que os primeiros dia é o tempo mas fertio.|`|4KXnidUxaa	A primeira dose apenas que tem q ser tomada no primeiro dia da menstru??o, quando vc iniciar o medicamento!<br>  Agora se vc tomar no ultimo dia, acho que n?o deve ter a mesma eficacia!!<br>  fa?a como sua medica mandou.....é o melhor......<br>  espero ter ajudado um pouquinhu!<br>  bjinhus

5NLyGGq2aa	olá, bem!!!! o parto normal deve doer só na hora de ganhar...mas a cesária, comcertesa vai doer por uma semana, fora os cuidados q, deve ter, para n?o infexcionar...avantagem do parto normal, é q, aparte q, me interessa, volta ao normal...a cesária, se n?o for feita uma boa sirurgia...imagine a cicatrix q, pode ficar depois....abra?o...|`|LgJWpDeLaa	N?o tem vantagem nenhuma, deveria ser apenas uma alternativa para casos de emergência.<br>  <br>  Se você está pensando na dor, converse com seu médico, pois é possível aplicar anestesia no parto normal.<br>  <br>  E essa história de que na cesárea n?o tem dor é a maior bobagem!! O corte dói muito depois! Fora o risco de ter aderência, aí é dor pro resto da vida.|`|09d096d54ab3ffc7caed63fe7bedc77eaa	N?o tem vantagem nenhuma!!!<br>  <br>  O parto cesárea é utilizado quando a m?e n?o consegue ter o filho por parto normal.<br>  <br>  A mulher que tem filho por parto normal se recupera em 1 dia e no segumdo já vai para casa, pois n?o há cirurgia ou corte algum no corpo.<br>  <br>  Além disso, o nenê cresce mais saudável, a m?e também e n?o fica cicatriz na m?e. é muito melhor o parto normal; o nome já diz "normal", a cesária é que é uma alternativa.<br>  <br>  O problema é que no normal o médico tem que esperar a hora em que a crian?a vai nascer; ent?o os médicos querem fazer sempre cesárea pois assim poder escolher a hora do parto, marcar hora, entendeu. Além disso, se for médico particular, ou convênio, é que eles querem fazer cesárea, pois a cesárea é uma cirurgia, ou seja, BEM MAIS CARO que um parto normal; sendo asim o médico ou o hospital ganha mais e perde menos tempo fazendo cesáreas.<br>  <br>  Pense na saúde de seu filho e fa?a uma parto normal!!!<br>  <br>  Boa sorte!!!|`|26F4bVjUaa	que n?o dói é só isso. um abra?o!!!!!|`|3zFsFMmOaa	pra mim,foi indicada pelo fato do bebe ser maior que minha bacia.eu amei fazer cesarea,nao senti dor antes e nem depois.pretendo ter mais 1 filho,mas antes de engravidar vou ao meu ginecologista p/ele me garantir que vou fazer cesarea de novo.quanto ao fato de recupera?ao,depende da mulher:eu no segundo dia andava normalmente,ja tem algumas que se aproveitam e ficam deitadas 40dias.|`|KDueLIG0aa	Nenhuma, o parto norma é muito melhor vc sente dor na hora mais depois que nasce vc n?o sente mais nada, vai logo pra casa e volta ao corpo normal mais rápido, a cesária vc n?o sente dor na hora mais depois, vai depender da ajuda de todo mundo pra fazer as coisas e vai ficar sentindo muita dor..|`|MQ6udk4saa	oi tudo bem.meu parto foi cezaria pois meu bebe estava sentado.minha bolsa estouro em casa 1:00h tomei banho me troquei e fui para o hospital o medico viu que ele estava sentado,nisso n?o sentia nenhuma dor e já era 3:30.ai subi e fui direto para centro cirrurgico e ganhei no sus santa marcelina.vantagens vai de organismo e de pisicologico em rela??o a dor eu n?o senti nada eu falo que n?o sei o que é ter filho mais nem por isso vou fazer uma creche kkkkk! n?o levei pontos e é bem baixa mesmo e bem clarinha quase n?o se ver vai tambem de cicatriza??o.fiquei 3 dias.o normal tambem se leva pontos em baixo depende do tamanho da crian?a.e tem todo aquele tempo para chegar aos 10 dedos de dilata??o,e a crian?a nasceu a dor passou! ai vai da escolha no parto normal tambem pode se tomar anestesia que vc n?o sente dor  das contra?oes,mais tem que fazer bastante for?a.os medicos em alguns casos n?o d?o pois o intuito das contra?oes nada mais é um estimulo para que a m?e fassa for?a para o bebe sair.e algumas m?es por n?osentire a dor n?o fazem a for?a nescessaria para espulsar o bebe.espero que eu tenha colaborado e veja com o médico a escolha é melhor  beijinhos|`|b1538f64318783209660b6290e615ffeaa	O parto cesárea tem indica??es específicas, há crian?as que n?o nasceriam se o parto fosse normal.<br>  <br>  Fora dessas indica??es, se o parto puder ser normal, é muito melhor tanto para a m?e quanto para o bebê.

If you have a cyst on your ovaries, then you could be having problems with that and that may make you think you are pregnant.  Your cyst could be bleeding and that is what is causing pain as well.  <br>  Don't just sit and wonder, go to the doctor, because it could be more serious as being pregnant.|`|4tQwZhQxaa	my naswer is that you should talk to a friend or tell your mother.

8nss9A5Faa	I'd love to be a Grandma. Mine are still way too young for that, but I plan on being there for my Grandkids and my adult children. I hadn't really thought about the spoiling part, only the teaching them how to make the perfect cookie, going to the game when they start a sport, having them over for nice long visits, etc.|`|UEHm04oUaa	I hope I have grandchildren someday...a long, long time in the future. I probably will spoil them some. I won't do anything to spoil them that his/her parent's don't agree with though. It really upsets me when my son's grandparent's do something with him that I don't agree with or isn't good for him. (like feeding him milk products when he has a milk allergy, or giving him lots of sweets when they know that I limit his sugar intake, or let him play with things that could hurt him just because he crys for it, etc.)|`|jLYTKr33aa	After recently telling me what he wants to be when he grows up, my son asked me what I want to be when HE grows up.  Of course, I said I want to be a Grammy.  I like to think that I'll strictly adhere to the rules that my son and his wife set for their children, but I know I'll spoil them.  After all, what  good is a Grammy if she doesn't indulge the kids?  =)|`|GO9mJ95xaa	Yes, my wife and I would love grand kids. But our children are more interested in their careers than having families.|`|LmGakmZxaa	Yes and Yes! I have thought of this quite a bit lately..lol Which is funny as we are bringing our youngest home from the NICU next week. I have made some allowances in how I am setting things up for the future in regards to being a grandma. I spoil my children so I imagine my grandchildren will be even more spoiled. I just hope our oldest children wait a few more years. I would hate for her or him to struggle as teen parents. School, college and then decide.|`|ZRoSQhG7aa	I AM a grandparent and no, I do not spoil my granddaughter. That would be a disservice to her. I want her to grow into a lovely adult just like her mother. Why in the world would I want to spoil that?<br>  <br>  I love my granddaughter dearly. I would do anything in the world to help her, but spoiling her would not help her. <br>  <br>  When my granddaughter misbehaves I am right there to help her learn how to behave better.

7gE81Rdvaa	Sounds like a normal newborn! Be CAREFUL giving a baby that young tylenol! He shouldnt be anywhere NEAR teething at 6 wks old! <br>  <br>  This is a trick the nurses told me about...<br>  Get an exercise ball (giant bouncy ball that they carry just about everywhere). Blow it up and sit on it while carefully holding your baby. CAREFULL bounce  on the ball a little. The bouncing will calm the baby almost immediately.<br>  <br>  If you dont have a ball, go in the bathroom and turn the water on in the sink while you hold your baby. Dont get him wet, just let him listen to the sound. This often calms fussy babies. <br>  <br>  You can also try holding him in your arm so his belly in on your arm and his back is facing up at you (so hes face down but then turn his face to the side for comfort and safety). This will help his belly feel better if he has gas.|`|60ea6ae5b2632d859dde05bbe67e16d9aa	Be patient. He may just cry himself to sleep theres nothing wrong with that. He could have diarhia just give him some juice in a bottle so its not as uncomfortable. If he's teething give him a cool temperature toy to chew on. Teething usually causes fevers and diarhia. Check with a doctor to see what kind of medicine reduces fever or if he needs it at all.<br>   Good luck!|`|C4JYCZFkaa	First off if he is 6 weeks old he isn't going to be teething yet.<br>  I don't think you are supposed to give Tylenol even baby Tylenol to an infant.  Take him to the hospital, he could get dehydrated if he is the "runs".  After all of this is over PLEASE go and buy books on being a new mother.|`|cqtSrvjtaa	why would you give a 6 week old tylenol his little body cant handle that right now. if his temp goes over 101.8 then call dr but nothing else, so dirty diapers referring to poop right , alot of it could be something he has eaten are you nursing if thats the case then it was something you ate that was different , broccoli, califlower spicy foods, if you are formula feeding then it could be the formula most children have 3 different kinds of formaul before finding the Right one for them , he is not teething he wouldnt have these symptoms, give him a comfortable bath feed him a small amount or nurse and comfort him he will be fine, <br>  <br>  so that he doesnt get a rash on his butt from you cleaning take precautions such as a wet rag instead of using wetwipes.|`|tIMG2jmZaa	Try giving your baby a massage and giving him gripe water, my baby also gets fussy but its more at night than day! You can also try drinking fennel seed tea, it helps to ease gas pains since your baby is breastfeeding. Keep him on his stomach, I find that helps my son aswell and it lets out the gas. You shouldnt give tylenol too much, and at 6 weeks he isnt teething quite yet, most babies teethe between 5 monthes onwards.|`|406106893148460c03b8c4326e2a6c5aaa	is he sleeping?|`|4e75168694f0f2cfb2b2b478bf424397aa	Most babies don't teeth until they are closer to 1 year, still there are some that are born with teeth. I doubt seriously that your baby is teething. If you are truly concerned call your doctor and see what they say. It's always better to be safe. Good luck!|`|Wkq4qK4caa	It wouldn't hurt to have him checked out.  As a mom, you will always get gut insticts, go with them.  :-)
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	The doctors gave me 50/50% chance to conceive. I was 29 at the time. My problem was endometriosis scarring on my uterus, ovaries and tubes. I only produced 5 usable eggs during my cycle regardless of the increase in medication. Ultimately I only had 3 viable embryoes to transfer.<br>  <br>  I now have a beautiful 1 year old that was conceived after only one round of IVF. Keep your chin up. A great attitude will help a lot. And spend the first 24 hours after transfer in bed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|Ur9dwWRraa	Have a look at www.fertilityfriends.co.uk especially the message boards. <br>  As for chances with IVF it depends on lots of different factors, mainly aroud the age of the woman, but also on the expertise of the clinic. If you have a look on the HFEA website, they publish all of the data reported on success rates. So far, the highest performing clinic for women in your age group is the ARGC in London.<br>  <br>  Did your doctor explain where s/he derived the 50-60% stats from?<br>  Best of luck with it. x
d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	I have one word for you......<br>  <br>  PORTABLE DVD PLAYER<br>  <br>  or an ipod with video function...or a laptop on which you can play dvds.<br>  I have only one child, but have done many long international flights (and all my friends travel with their small kids)....and the dvd player has been a life-saver. <br>  This is in addition to a little bag each with small toys. A small colouring book with crayons or coloured pencils.....and the great success for the 21/2-31/2 age....a sticker book with reusable stickers (do NOT get stickers that you cannot remove in case they stick them around the plane)....a magic drawing board (my dollar store has small ones)...<br>  Bring snacks that take a lot of concentration to eat....cherios, raisins etc.....maybe a selection of small bags of snacks. If you can order child meals make sure you do....the childrens meals arrive first. Find out how much liquid you can bring and use that for juice....a great calming agent.......in my expereince the flight attendants brought juice pretty quickly too!<br>  Also make sure that you get on the plane last (even though small children can board first)....you want them to be able to expend as much energy as possible BEFORE they get on the plane. I always waited near the gate until they announced final call (if there is an empty gate lounge nearby they can use it to play hide and seek until the last minute). <br>  Also check out the airport website (if they have one)..... some big airports have kids play rooms. <br>  Don`t expect help from ANYONE....even the flight attendants!<br>  So visualise how you will carry everything. I got my little girl a wheely bag when she was just turned 3 and she loves wheeling it herself (with her toys/activites inside). You can do this with your little girl.....but only you know if that will work with your boys (maybe small backpacks might be better)<br>  <br>  Get to the airport with plenty of time to spare.....watch the planes taking off then let them run off energy before getting on the plane.<br>  <br>  I wish you so much luck. In my experience the mobile baby days were more difficult than the toddler/preschooler days......but I have a friend with twins (now 4 yo) and I have watched them wind each other up......so I can totally understand your panic. Luckily this age is more easily entertained than the 1-2 age group.<br>  <br>  You will survive!!!!|`|8rbQBaIeaa	I have flown with my grandson who was three at the time. I took a small toy, coloring book and boy, did I spend the time playing with him...LOL It was a three hour trip to Miami Fl. Will you have someone on the plane with you?

Good Luck...wish I had more for you|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Oh man thats scary!  Pack each of them a little back pack with coloring books, toys, snacks, little games they can play, thats all I can think of.

KtdlJbrOaa	My daughter drank an entire bottle of Motrin when she was little (child-proof, my a$$).  I did call Poison Control as well - and they told me there was nothing to worry about - watch for vomiting, etc.  <br>  <br>  Point is - I don't think the Tums will be harmful, but I also know it's hard to stop worrying.  Plus, I imagine you are blaming yourself a bit.  Don't - these things happen.  Some children just "explore" more than others & seem to find things we think we had in a safe place.  Quit beating yourself up, sit with him and read a story.  He'll be fine.  |`|xCTqOGxqaa	Yes while babysitting my sister when she was only 2 she ate some laxative pills they were coated with that red sweet  coat and I think she thought theywere candy but it was scary but it happens and I think the lesson I learned is kids will find a way to do the weirdest thing in a blink of an eye. <br>  <br>  Don't be hard on yourself it happens..<br>  My sister is fine she's 21 now  they just told me to watch her for seriuos symptoms just like you .|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	If it makes you feel any better I phoned my brother who is an ER physician and a pediatrician ( he also did a fellowship in pediatric intensive care at Vandy) and he said the same thing your doctor and poison control said. He also said this happens alot and that Tums is a favorite of children.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I am sure he will be fine.  You did all the right things as far as poison control and such.  It is hard to find spots where they can't get into.  We finally (with the 3rd kid) put a simple hook and eye latch on the linen closet and we keep all meds in there and the latch is up at the top of the door frame.  My husband tho, is notorious for taking something out and leaving it on his vanity counter!  <br>  <br>  Stuff happens, be thankful it wan't anything worse.  You did everythign right. |`|y7osL8qPaa	You don't think you need to be worried about it and you really don't need to make your self feel sick. Things happen and if that is the worst thing he gets in to as a child your doing great...  If you spoke with poison control and they are not telling you to go to the ER he should be fine. |`|FvYqKZSMaa	I work at a hospital and they are right.I know as a parent you are feeling uneasy and nervous.In the future make sure he does not get into other meds.He should be fine.And yes the med.cabinet is the best place.Try givig him water.It should deslove some of it.|`|xuhTe9X8aa	One things for sure.....He ain't gonna get heart burn!|`|nfzQkvqraa	My son has experimented with diaper rash cream, and clorox spray cleaner both which would worry me more than tums.  I thought his insides would literally melt away, but each time I called poison control they said the same thing they said to you.  And NOTHING happened either time.  That's not to say that we as parents shouldn't be a little more careful about where we put things, but accidents happen and are always going to which is why they have a poison control number for us to call.  He will be find I'm sure.|`|Lh9sR24Raa	Be thankful it was Tums. If you are still feeling uneasy, take him to the emergency room. <br>  <br>  Next time keep stuff like that "out of reach".<br>  |`|5dapG40caa	It happens to the best of us.  I have 4 and they get into everything, regardless of where we put it.  It will not hurt him to have eaten a few tums, as they contain calcium which is good for him.  Give him some warm milk to settle his stomach if it gets upset and he will be fine.  My little ones have done the same thing, they are all fine.  Just be glad it wasn't your Ex-lax, that's a messy one.  You don't need to feel sick yourself, children are forever getting into everything, as long as you are doing your best to keep things out of reach you are doing your part.  My three year old is part monkey as she climbs to get into everything and is doing fine.  Your son will be okay and you will too.  Sit down and have a snack with him and both of you can relax a minute.|`|AS6rRiBEaa	Yes My son was 2 and a half. He and another three year old were at my friends house, while we were in the living room the boys went into the laundry room climb on the washer and got a spray bottle from the cabnit above. They were spraying the stuff into there mouths. When he walk in to the room he came up to me and said this water is yucky! I took the bottle and smelled it only to my horror it was bleach!  I called 911 immediately. I lived in the back woody ares of Auburn, CA, so it took over 28 mins for a ambulance to reach us. The 911 operator told us to have him drink nothing.  They rushed him into Roseville hospital.  They had a surgeon ready to open his throat in case he was to vomit. B/C the bleach would burn this throat like acid coming back up.  After alot of time he was deemed ok and we got to go,  They said the only thing that probably saved his life was  he ate a huge plate of spaghetti right before, so the spaghetti absorbed the bleach and made it better to digest. Thank God He Saved him too!  He has no ill effect now and he in 18!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Tums is just calcium, you did the right thing by calling the ped and poison control, he's going to be just fine.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Call poison control.  The number is: 1-800-222-1222.  I actually have that number is my cell (I know, I'm a little crazy) but I'm glad I did!  I caught my 1 year son with a bottle of clear finger nail polish that my 3 year had opened and given him.  They were great and helped me calm down and gave me good info on what to do.  Awesome, awesome resource for parents!|`|miPubuDYaa	I don't think the tums will do anything to harm him.He definitly will not have heartburn today j/k.

awZ51aLHaa	You do not have to put him on the birth cert. for him to pay child support.<br>  <br>  I didn't put my baby's father on the BC and all they have to do is just give him a DNA test when the baby is born and everything gets settled for court.<br>  <br>  He can demand custody but I seriously doubt that he'll get it because of him not being there throughout your pregnancy.<br>  He could only get custody if he can prove you're an unfit parent meaning you do drugs or have had a child abuse or sexual assault in the past. I wouldn't worry about that part too much considering he hasn't been there really so far so you really have nothing to to worry about when it comes to the custody part.<br>  <br>  To avoid any problems in the future, I wouldn't put him on the BC.<br>  <br>  I don't have any regrets of not putting my baby's father on hers.<br>  That's what was best for my daughter.|`|xzKemZWPaa	What you need to do is contact health and human services in your state that know the local laws and can help you.  <a href="http://www.mdhs.state.ms.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdhs.state.ms.us/</a>  That is a link I found just doing a quick search online...  Good luck!|`|r5YAyYkLaa	You can't put him on the birth certificate without his signature.<br>  If he does sign and later down the road you want your husband to adopt the father on the certificate will have to be involved in the process to give up rights and sign papers. <br>  If you want to get child support he has to be on the birth certificate.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	You do need to put his name on the birth certificate so that he is named the presumptive father.  Child support will not be automatic, however, you will need to contact your county child support agency to set up an order.  If his paychecks are irregular since he is a server, they can figure the amount he needs to pay by using his past tax returns.  <br>  <br>  Joint custody is the norm, with the non custodial parent having visitation one day/night a week and every other weekend.  If you want anything different, you will have to tell the court why.  <br>  <br>  He will be responsible for making the payments weekly, whether he receives a check or not.  If he does not get a check, the judge would expect him to go to the county clerk to make the payment.  <br>  <br>  If a stepfather wanted to adopt your child, this does not automatically terminate the biological father's financial responsibility to the child.  You would have to petition the court for that.  (You would also have to notify the presumptive father of any adoption).  <br>  <br>  Should he not pay - arrears will accrue and you will receive what is due to the child from any tax refunds or lottery winnings he may be entitled to.  |`|aWU6YCH3aa	If you put his name on the birth certificate, yes he will pay child support or go to jail if he doesnt pay, but that will also give him rights to your child so he would be able to have visitation. <br>  If you are married and put the the fathers name on the BC yes you will have to track him down hire a lawyer and terminate his rights, then your husband can adopt your child.|`|Q2RqoosQaa	He will have to pay child support and all this stuff will have to be determined in court.  Very expensive because you will have to hire an attorney.  He can't "demand" custody and in every state it is extremely hard for a father to take a child away from the mother.  Trust me...<br>  <br>  With the birth certificate - in order for your new husband to be able to adopt the child, the father in question will have to sign off saying that he doesn't want anything to do with the child (if I remember correctly.)<br>  <br>  When they set the amount of child support, that will be done by the judge - I have no idea about the amount, but it is a percentage of wages.  As a server, you will not be getting very much from him - but after the child support is taken out of his check, he won't be getting hardly anything either.  <br>  <br>  This is just my opinion, but if you fear this is going to happen, maybe contact an attorney for an consultation to answer these types of questions.  They are very law specific and could be different than we are telling you.|`|UgX5WeGPaa	okay. yes he can get joint custody if he requests.  they will grant him visitation.  if you can prove he cannot provide a safe enviornment then i'm sure you can have limiations set.  <br>  they determine how much he owes based on a number of things.  his salary being one of them, child care and expenses another.  yes, if not paycheck, no garnishment.  if he does not pay it goes in arears and builds up. once at certain point of not paying a warrent will be issued for his arrest.  it will go against his credit and a lein can be placed.  he will not be able to buy anything until your paid.  <br>  most likely you'd have to try and track him down before being adoped.<br>  good luck and look the custody up in your state.  best way to get info.|`|iLLoc003aa	His child support will be whatever is proved that he makes...so if he is a server, they will go by min wage....he more than likely will not get custody but he will def get visitation if he is a good person...if you were to get married, yes your husband can adopt but the babies father would have to give up rights....if this is the case, don't put a name on the birth cert...just say you don't know who it is...may make you look bad but you won't have the hastle if you may not get chis support anyways...

Always makes my day.|`|y4XaIoxZaa	the most wonderful thing I EVER heard in my life was when she said mum-mum for the first time and reached out for me.

That's my favorite, especially when I do something to make my daughter laugh, and it is unintentional!  I gave her a bath last night, and since she has 2 different scents of shampoo, I let her pick one.  I was making the bottles 'talk', going back and forth between them with them each saying "pick me" - "no, pick me!".  She is 4, and got the biggest kick out of it!  Something I wouldn't imagine would be silly, she just cracks up laughing at!  It's awesome...|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Well . . . . hearing them sleep is up there.<br>  <br>  Nah, joking.

My son just laughs and laughs at the smallest thing.  For some reason he thinks that I am really funny.  It makes me laugh and then he laughs.  It is a wonderful cycle.  I like the phone ring as laughter.  I am going to try to set that up.  He doesn't talk yet, but I am hoping that Mommy is coming soon.|`|abL5DaiBaa	Nothing better than the noise and laughter of children, it tells us they are happy and healthy :) Also, the sound of their gentle breathing when asleep, is also a great sound to hear!<br>  <br>  I always see people telling their children to shut up or keep quite when they are happy as they are making too much noise!|`|7uVlYPEIaa	My mom always calls it angel music. I remember her saying it when I was a kid and she had my now 18 year old sister, and then again when my 11 year old sister was a baby. I didn't know what she meant until I had my son. I love that sound. Who can be upset or mad when their child smiles at them. My girls are starting to coo and smile great big now (3 1/2 months) and it just melts your heart. Even at 5 my son can brighten a day with his smile.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	I know what you mean.  I love to hear my daughter laugh with her friends when they sleep over.  They have jokes about their distintive laughs too, my daughter is said to have a  guinea pig stuck in her throat because when she 'really laughs' she sort or has a squeal thing happening.  Only if we could go back there too!

cAtWxJG1aa	How would it have helped to have called? If something serious had happened, nobody would have answered your call even if you had called, and there would have been nothing you could have done.  If something minor had happened, your daughter's caretaker would have called you.  <br>  <br>  Save beating yourself up for the times when you really could have done something.  You're not even in contention for worst mother if that's the best you can do.<br>  <br>  Glad everyone's okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  radiatio-- good (make that great) people generally refrain from gratuitously hurtful comments to upset strangers.  kicking yourself? just saying.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Radiation is a troll (FYI)  <br>  <br>  And as long as your daughter is fine, don't worry!   No, you shouldn't kick yourself.  :)|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Do not beat yourself up over this - it was just a few minutes.

As a single mother tho, it's just not really an option for me.  Does this make me a bad mother?|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I am sorry, but my Title is not up for sale.<br>  <br>  Mother's are still human.

You aren't a bad mother at all; you're just human. <br>  <br>  Last spring my mom had a total freakout in the parking lot as we were loading into the car after a long day at the beach shrieking, "where's the baby?" My stepdad, two sisters and I just stared at her as she continued to panic. The baby was in one of those baby bjorns on her chest and was probably getting sick as she ran around looking for him in a panic. Point being: when you're worn out, tired or going through a shock you make mistakes. <br>  <br>  It's okay. Your daughter is okay. Your husband is a loving dad who checked up on her and filled you in. You are all okay......<br>  <br>  Go have a coffee and give yourself a little break.|`|1ae77a9a7af549290e78fcd800756ae6aa	No you are not horrible! Your hubby called and checked on her/no need for two parents to call.  The daycare was most likely being bombarded with calls.  You must really trust them or she would not be with them in the first place!  That is a good thing.  Some people leave their kids with their parents and freak out about it. She must be in good hands:)|`|xErfHNKUaa	There is no reason to beat yourself up over this. Sometimes you forget things in a hectic day, it does not make you a bad mother, it makes you human. Everyone is ok and you sound pretty normal to me. God Bless|`|pzY0ARqDaa	Well, your not a bad mother.<br>  Your typical. There is far worst things that mothers can do out there and this certainly isnt one of them. <br>  Just be happy that she is okay!<br>  :-)|`|pXsVFH9Aaa	noo. it's fine. you just didn't know it was severe. it could have been anything. just be happy your daughters okay =]|`|DVvztK2Baa	noooooooooooooooo ur not <br>  you just weren't thinkin|`|7uVlYPEIaa	Worst mother? No those are the ones letting their 12 years old run around wild with no supervision to the point the know what sex is and have enough alone time to do it and get pregnant. You are far from worse mother. Worse mother would not of cared that she didn't call or that there was evan an earthquake there.<br>  <br>  Let up on yourself. If you still feel guilty after you get off work take her to McDonalds and then stop at the store and get ice cream to share over a movie or show she likes.|`|Z971opTYaa	I think that if you want to kick yourself then go ahead...A 3.6 earthquake is minor often felt,but rarely causes damage..You knew your daughter was in good hands and you did not know what was going on..I am sure earthquake was far from your mind...You did nothing wrong so do not beat yourself up about it...Relax and i was kidding about the kicking yourself :)

One morning right before christmas the grandmother died in her sleep and while the police and ems were there the little girl looked up at me with tears running down her face asked me to "please wake "nanny" up" it was gut wrenching. The saddest part happen the next morning... the little girl also passed away. They were buried in the same casket.

I'll be all by myself " and he let out this gut-wrenching cry that made my whole body shake. I felt sooooo bad. I didn't know what to do. On the one hand I was still grieving myself plus trying to help him with his plus trying to adjust and ease him into an adjustment of just him and me.

"It just wasn't important to daddy to come to your party". I was HORRIFIED. The little boy looked at me and said "Daddy thinks I'm not important?"<br>  <br>  I said "Of course he does honey! He just got lost on the way here!" The dad DID end up coming and I tore my friend a new one.

My girls are crazy about stuff like that.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Most kids that age are really into Hannah Montana, High School Musical, Jonas Brothers etc. All the popular Disney Channel stuff, you can get stuff having to do with that at walmart/target. If you want to opt for a more mutual gift, a journal set that comes with a diary, gel pens, stickers, and stuff like that is a good idea. Another good idea is some age appropriate jewelry(anything from Claire's, or they usually have a children's jewelry section in most stores), a decorate a purse kit, Stuff like that.  You could always ask her mom what she's into.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	for my 10yr old daughter i got her a small cheap digital camera for her to play around and take pictures of her friends.

8zdPI8Qsaa	I adore the privilege of being able to be home with my son all day! He's 14 months now, and we're pretty low-key. Don't have too many planned events during the week, but try to make a point of getting out once everyday. Our mornings are relaxed so we just have breakfast and play & then I shower during his morning nap. We have lunch around noon and then he's usually a big enough mess that he needs a bath. Our mid-afternoon time is when we usually try to either get groceries/other errands, or go over to my in-laws or have someone over. He then has an afternoon nap which is when I can get some cleaning done, and I'm lucky that my husband comes home by about 5 each day. We used to play out in the yard after nap time til he came home, and then my hubby & son play together while I make dinner. I love our little routine... but am finding the time change has made it harder! By the time he wakes up from his nap it's already getting dark which isn't very enjoyable. We're still trying to figure out what we're going to do with our late afternoons all winter when it gets dark so early. I wouldn't give it up for anything though... even those days that get long and lonely :-)|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I like it a lot. I went from working at a daycare for 12 1/2 years to staying at home. It was hard at first (went through severe PPD; was hospitalized for it for 5 days) but now that I am better I love it! If it's nice out, which it has been the past few days here in Ohio, I will take my 7 1/2 month old daughter to the park and put her in the bucket swing or go down the slide with her. I will set up a blanket in my front yard with toys and play with her out there. I take her to the library in the kids section and play with her there. We play in the house. Sometimes I go shopping with her if we need stuff. It works out pretty well. I admit I have let the house go a little. I should be cleaning more but when she naps I'm just exhausted and usually can't nap so I sit down by the computer, like I am doing now :)  We go on walks in the stroller and Baby B'jorn too.  Sometimes play with a friend.|`|HJNJCaFGaa	my daughter is 17 months old. she plays with toys, we read books, we watch a few DVDs, we go to the park, we go to the kids' museum, we listen to music and dance, we go shopping, we go to music class, we go to the library, we color. some days are more active than others...it all depends on the weather, what HAS to be done, etc. i do get cooking and cleaning and computer stuff done intermittently while she plays, and i exercise (we have an exercise bike) during her one nap. our only schedule is her nap and once weekly music class -- beyond that it is very loose. i could not bear to send her away for the day; i love being with her. of course, there are days when i miss being able to pee by myself, or running to the store quickly and alone, or getting a pedicure, but those moments of longing are nothing compared to how grateful i am that i get to be with her every day. also, now that she is older, i get a day off every other week at least, when she goes to her grandparents' for the day. so overall, i am super lucky and definitely know that. |`|kRqm2X2Baa	I love it! Generally I come on the computer when he is napping. But then we play a lot and sing when he is awake. Sometimes I clean while he is awake and just let him play by himself. He doesn't mind that so long as we are in the same room together. I only take him out of the room if I'm using chemicals. I love all the time I get to spend with him. In the morning we tend to watch tv in bed together and tickle and play till he falls asleep around 10 for his nap. |`|7sB3Lbdcaa	I have a 3 month old, a 4 year old, and a 6 year old. Though my 2 olders are in all day school, i like being home with the baby, but i went from always having a job, to not having anything. I like it other than not being able to control my own finances. All i do all day is clean and cook...and when there's nothing left to be cleaned..i find something to clean. Cook supper for my hubby, play with the baby, go for walks with the baby. I really enjoy getting to be home with the baby for her first months! Other than she is spoiled rotten!!!|`|aqnlHMTDaa	I am a SAHM as well. I am still adjusting to having 2 kids under 2. I just gave birth a month ago and I have a VERY BUSY 19 month old. I actually could use a few pointers on how to get organized and such. I have noticed that I have been getting frustrated with my 19 month old more because she has been acting up to get attention. So any tips would be great, please feel free to email me some at lil_chevy_momma2007@yahoo.com. <br>  thanks.|`|wH41PEllaa	I have a 7 month old baby, I am 26 years old so I find it very hard to stay at home!

I would take the kids to a cooperative preschool - in which I was very involved (president, fund raising chair, etc.), sometimes do lunch or another afternoon activity with another mom & her kids, I ran a daycare in my home, kept a very clean house, did laundry every day, was able to cook gourmet meals, go on fieldtrips with the kids.  <br>  <br>  Now I'm a single mom, so I have to work a full time and part time  job.  Thank goodness they are older (14, 12, & 9), but I really miss just being able to spend time with them, being able to come and see them at school.  There's just not enough hours in the day.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I wish I can be a stay at home momma. I always look forward to the weekends because that's when I have my babies ALL day long. <br>  <br>  I usually sleep till they wake up (6am) while they are having their morning bottle I can sometimes take a quick shower sometimes not. After breakfast, we sometimes take a walk if the weather is nice. They nap when we get back, I pick up the apt or watch a movie during that time.  Rest of the day, we play or run errans|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	i had a baby two months ago and i really dont do much at home just watch tv, and clean up a bit, i have cleaning deep on fridays and laundry on thurs. i cant do much either b/c my baby is till young and needs me 24 7, at first i liked being home but now i get bored, when days are good but the baby is fussy and want settle down i want help and want to be away. but soon i will return to work and i know i will miss my leo!!! and i will prob miss him more like when he is 5-8 months when they are more alert and play and can be entertained with dancing,playing. but my job is only while school is in session. i will be off for the whole summer so that will be good to catch. but its exhausting. plus i need to work for more money my husband and i want to buy a condo or a home and we need to save money$$$$|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I am a stay at home mom for the first time. My son is only about 4 and half weeks old. I am 22 years old. I LOVE being home with my baby I could not imagine leaving him with anyone else during the day it would break my heart and I would miss his far too much! <br>  <br>  During the day I am busy taking care of my little guy (obviously lol) I also clean, laundry, cook. Then I am taking online courses which keep me pretty busy!  I have a friend with a baby a few weeks older than mine we try to get together as often as possible!
KtdlJbrOaa	That is beautiful!  Your English is just fine.|`|b274bdcef529af1a95fd443e4e73d070aa	"A baby is God's opinion that the world should go on"<br>  <br>  Last week I dreamt twice of my baby! On Wednesday, I dreamt of a very tiny girl that I could hold on the palm of my right hand. On Thursday, I dreamt of a boy that I fed with kisses (in my dreams, the boy was the baby of my sister's best friend). I felt anguish because I thought he would not make it without food, but I was amazed that he was growing and looking very healthy because of my kisses! This dream showed me that the biggest thing my baby will have is going to be my love!<br>  <br>  Today I'm very happy because I'm going to see my baby again! Last week I felt him/her moving a lot while I was trying to sleep. It's a wonderful feeling... I don't care if I'm interrupted in my sleep. For me, everytime he/she moves it is like a knock from God in my womb to remind me that I'm blessed! That's why people say: Mom is mom!

AA10544101	Sippy cups come in all forms, shapes, and sizes. And each child is different. However, i would recommend trying a soft-tip sippy cup. The tip of the sippy cup is soft like the nipple of the bottle. This especially helps if your son is teething. You can buy these types of sippy cups at Walmart for about 1 buck.<br>  <br>  Another great thing to do is to take the plastic valve out. There should be a plastic valve under the lid of the sippy cup, which is what makes it spill proof. If you take the valve out, teh liquid just comes out, and the child has no choice but to drink. This will probably be messy, so i recommend starting with water first. Our second son was also not wanting to use a sippy cup, and taking out the valve is what finally did it.<br>  <br>  Let your son play with the sippy cup. Put a little water in it, or leave it empty, and jsut let him play with it. This helps him get comfortable with it. <br>  <br>  Dip the tip of the sippy cup in some juice or milk. This way, then he put the tip of the sippy cup in his mouth, he will taste something he likes, and will want to use it more.<br>  <br>  Don't give in. Many parents say..."Oh, just let them take their time. They will eventually do it." But now-a-days, parents are letting their kids 'take-their-time' a little too much. I see 4 years olds still in diapers, and 5 year olds still on a bottle because parents keep giving in and they think that its a bad idea to try and make them learn something. Dont give hima bottle if he starts to cry. He is at the exact age where they learn how to manipulate. Dont give in.|`|01a5366fa889bc0b1fd9a25b88be52aeaa	My sons wouldn't either so i introduced a normal cup at mealtimes which they took to really well but with a few spills. I only put a few sips worth in. Then try spout top bottle when your out and cant use a cup.|`|241ca2afa2991b9c68d0cc958b73e8dfaa	I was just recently having the same problem, except my son just turned 2 on the 29th of october.  He refused to drink out of a sippy, only bottles.  The day after his birthday, daddy made him a bottle and baby threw it at daddy, so daddy gave him a sippy and said "that's all you get today", and he immediately went up to the cup and started drinking out of it.  It just takes time, don't rush an 11 month old to grow into a big boy, cherish those baby years, they fly by.  He will drink from a sippy when he is ready!|`|26273c316fa490efa7ab68b788d98327aa	Because he feels like a big boys and he doesn't want a sippy cup he wants a regular cup or he wants his bottle back.|`|74b53f1370af68e2b5c96903c9ff27ecaa	My daughter had a hard time weening off the bottle to a sippy cup until we found Nuby cups.

Put only formula in his bottles and give him juice in his sippy cup.  Maybe even skip the sippy and go to the plasic cups with lids and straws.  My daughter took a sippy when she was 6 or 7 months old with juice then when she was used to that we got rid of the bottles.  Now that she's used to the lid with straw she'll drink out of that.  She sometimes uses a sippy but usually a cup and straw with lid.  She's 17 months old|`|AA11603761	Make it his only choice.|`|151d236db0cc9d95a4319f0fb2ec0469aa	He's just not used to it. You're just going to have to give it to him and if he uses it then great, if he doesn't that's fine too. Eventually he'll give into it when he realizes how thirsty he is. It's either him giving in once, or you giving in alot! :-)|`|21b4c950d22868ec047dd5b2e130b9abaa	Take out the little rubber thingy on the inside that makes it spill proof so that he can easily get the liquid out. As he gets more used to it, put it back in. He'll be a sippy cup pro in no time. Now if I can just convince my daughter that the dog is not going to learn out how to drink from a sippy cup.|`|3af50cb1ceffef2000edc43fa4591f00aa	don't worry, i had the same problem.  the transition cup that worked best for my kids was made by nubby, the mouthpeice is rubbery, the same consistancy of a nipple, but it's in the form of a sippy cup.  from there i converted them onto a straw cup.|`|AA11712072	my 9 month old baby girl dont like them i just give her water in a glass and help her drink out of it

bcc25e521e13f2b1553d085ce2944282aa	Dads have deeper voices. they are bigger and stronger than mom, and it was mom who breast fed or got up in the middle of the night to bottle. Mom is the first face they saw ever...it all adds up.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	Not in my house - my kids know their dad is a lot easier to get around than I am........they have him wrapped around their little fingers!

So dont give that bull!|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	It's the authority they respect.  Women need a backup - they're with the children most of the time, and the kids take them for granted.  Which is why single parenting is such a bad thing.|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	A man's voice is always associated with authority.  |`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	The child(ren) will listen to the parent who asserts their authority. In our house our children listen pretty much the same to both of us although there have been some incidences where one parent (Mom or Dad) was having a particularly rough time w/a child where reinforcements/backup was needed.<br>  More often then not, it's the stay-at-home-parent whom the children have less respect for their authority than the parent at work simply because it can become awfully tiresome raising children. What I mean is, if the sahp has their hands full, doing all the chores, running errands, preparing meals, tending to lessons,etc, while taking care of all the children and more often than not little to no social life, it can really wear the sahp down to the point where the same behavior time and time again throughout the day could provoke, instead of the needed consistency of the punishment (ex: time-out), to the parent stating "You wait until your father/mother gets home." Pretty much pushing the authority off on the other parent and stating the child, he/she is the head of household and we all listen to him/her.|`|APrvPTsNaa	If I'm honest, I think it's because kids get used to hearing mum nagging at them. I do it. They just tune you out, knowing that ultimately they'll have to do it, but also that they can do it on their terms. When Dad says it, they pay more attention because a shouting Daddy is much scarier than a shouting mummy, who probably has meltdowns on a daily basis. Or is that just me?|`|f2NRVCdTaa	Its that way in my house too. My husband has a very deep voice, and when he tells them to do something they know he means Business. I knew if I didn't do something my father told me to do, I would probably get a spanking so it was good incentive. Whoever is the main disciplinarian in the house, is who they will listen to. |`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	Not in my house.<br>  I have to play the heavy as my husband doesn`t discipline at all.<br>  <br>  It`s funny when my husband says she can do something and then she checks with me to see if it is ok.<br>  BTW - I REALLY try not to contradict my husband in front of our daughter......but my daughter knows the rules in our house (that I have set) and likes to abide by them.|`|4a0a53942794765dcd1f4fa16f4aea7faa	That is exactly the same in my house, i have 2 daughters 3 + 5, i just need to give them a stern look and they stop what they are doing, maybe they see the father as figure of authority, as they spend more time with their mum whilst i am at work. |`|3GfFMfLnaa	what really happens that even a small kid knows that who is dominated by whom<br>  i.e if mother is dominating than father in the family then they will show more  awareness to the mother order and vice versa.<br>  its seems you r more dominating than your wife in your family<br>  |`|KRuATLreaa	I totally agree with you Emily Hobhouse. I too am a single mother of 3 dealing with no support from the father as far as discipline. Muffin you're completely wrong for blasting her. I think different circumstances determine how children react. |`|hLQrQ1bbaa	have you ever heard it when the mother says, wait til your father gets home? well its away of passing the buck with discipline
e4173fb8ce96e86fb799d3a08c0de68eaa	no...but you may want to not have sex until your off the antibiotic to be the safe thing...thats if you dont want to get pregnant...im a product of this...my mom didnt know this back in 86 so i was informed about it early on in life|`|KtdlJbrOaa	it's possible, but not very likely.|`|Wk4VXIlhaa	It is very unlikely that will happen. 
Mzvp1LPFaa	I remind myself that I am human, that I will occasionally react, and that children are incredibly resilient and not easily damaged for life.<br>  <br>  He may need some specific training to come when called.  I think confining him to his chair immediately afterward was perfect; the discipline fit the crime.  I would have swatted him for running off in the first place - it's one of the few things I spanked for.  By the time you got him home he probably had forgotten what it was that he did.  Preschoolers have rather short memories.  However, if you did tell him to lie down and stay there it was appropriate to swat his bum to enforce your authority when repeatedly putting him back  didn't work.<br>  <br>  I know you are mad right now, and with good reason!  Your child could have gotten to the parking lot or street and been hit by a car.  But once you  recover,  think about ways you could prevent him from getting too far away or ways you could distract and redirect (big colorful ball) so you're ready for next time.  They are fast and impulsive and can dart any direction toward something of interest in a moment's time.  Walking him in the soccer field was brilliant, since there is considerable space there away from the road.   Is there a small playground made for younger kids?  That would probably keep him enthralled for awhile.<br>  <br>  Please do not beat yourself up.  You did the best you could under the circumstances and you showed remarkable restraint considering how stressed and scared you were.  He isn't damaged for life. Next time he probably won't even remember.  Keep going to the park to socialize him to other people and to burn off the excess energy.  It's great for both of you and very healthy.|`|0N3ks6r0aa	Well first of all, you didn't do anything wrong.  Every parent has days and times when they feel like the worst in the world, and (I don't say this to make you feel worse), this will not be the only time that you feel bad or guilty about something you've done or a decision you've made.  This is totally normal behavior for your son, and a totally appropriate response from you.  As for the swat on the butt, I personally think that it's warranted and needed from time to time, for serious offenses - which this absolutely was.  What if he had run straight into traffic?  There are some things that children HAVE TO HAVE TO learn ASAP, and not running off is one of them.  Hopefully your seriousness and attention to the matter made it clear to him that what he did is not okay!  You're fine, and you really shouldn't worry any more about this.  Parenting is a tough as hell job, and it sounds like you're doing what you need to do.  :)|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Oh my goodness - I'm sure there are so many of us who have been there and done that.  I know you don't like doing it, but your son needs discipline now.  If you do not stay firm with him he will only get more & more out of control.  You should not feel badly about a light swat on the behind.  By no means did you "beat" him - you were enforcing your point.  Bravo to you for disciplining him.  <br>  <br>  Oh, & just an FYI - it does get better, say from 4-10 years old, but when they do hit the teen years, they seem to revert to toddler behavior & tantrums sometimes.  It's a tough thing, but we do it  because we love them.  Good luck.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	-- 2-year-olds are tough on everybody;<br>  -- I'm a non-spanker, but even I don't think the fact that by giving your son one tap on the bottom you've even remotely ruined him for life.  If kids were that fragile every parent would have irretrievably messed up their kid somehow before the age of 3;<br>  -- just make a plan for how to handle it next time.  personally i'd hold his hand until you're sure he's got the idea, and if he runs off again he'd be immediately on his way home.  try for calm and consistent discipline, and keep in mind that it gets easier over time.  and when you're angry is a good time to put him in his room while you calm down, because it's hard to make your best-thought-out disciplinary decisions when you're mad;<br>  -- everyone else is going to tell you to spank.  that's ultimately up to you, but it's really not a requirement and i don't think you made a mistake in not spanking him when he ran away.  i agree with you it's hard to justify a "no one hits but the parent" rule.  my 2-year-old responds to time-outs, being carried away from the playground or whatever, and losing access to his favorite toy for awhile.  
dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Good nicknames <br>  <br>  I do not like them as first name|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like it actually but I am not so sure it should be a real name  A nick name is okay <br>  I found the name Flint and Arrow so I guess Scout would be okay too.|`|doLyOac0aa	Dogs Names,<br>  <br>  Not Baby Names,|`|NXcTnS9Xaa	don't like it|`|GpY2SF0oaa	You did it again! Heart raised again for a second time in a short time! <br>  Personally I don't like it but i don't see much wrong with the names. bit strange and out there for me but they are their kids. I prefer Scout but not by much! <br>  put it together and makes Scout Trip sounds like something you would enter on the calendar not call kids!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I had a high school teacher who named his DAUGHTER Scout after the character in To Kill A Mockingbird...she'd be like fourteen years old by now. (No, he wasn't even an English teacher) So, I guess I think of it more as a girl name, if a name at all. But I personally wouldn't DREAM of using it for a child of mine. Ick!|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Nicknames, sure.  Real names, no.|`|AA10826403	I like both names, but I really think they are both used best as nick names.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	Fine as nicknames, not so much as full names.|`|o2WEoWp5aa	They sound a bit like dog names.|`|kCiizn5oaa	Scout is quite cute and original<br>  <br>  Trip? ha ha no too far out for me sorry|`|KtdlJbrOaa	they are ok, I like Trip better<br>  |`|lfKBjUmmaa	Ah, Scout from To Kill A Mockingbird, my favorite book..

I don't mind the name, actually.|`|IjSVNOZraa	They're ok for nicknames, but not as names. <br>  <br>  Imagine writing that on a resume, Scout Smith. No one would take him seriously.|`|vQWt9Dcyaa	Scout reminds me of Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird (who's a girl) and Trip is just ridiculous.

KtdlJbrOaa	A child cannot truly thrive without some type of love and support.  It's one thing to provide the basics - food, clothing, & shelter - but a child needs more to be a thoughtful, caring citizen.  |`|A03NJA26aa	Both loving and providing are important. Some think providing is enough to justify love but it isn't. My parents provide for me and I understand and respect that but I never hear "i love you" on a daily basis and no  type of affection is shown in my house so no, it is not enough just to provide and say "I provide for you that's good enough". Any age is affected by this. I have been all my life. |`|yuBuNoPDaa	This is a really good question. It's not but I suspect that some parents actually think it's enough. That's pretty sad. Even senior citizens with health problems need more than just the basics. Of course kids do because they have much to learn. How are they going to survive? Are they going to have a hard life or maybe an easier one or at least one in which they are prepared? |`|GBofRdHYaa	No; providing the basic food/water/shelter/clothing isn't enough as a parent's role. Children need to know the Mom & Dad love them unconditionally. That said; children of all ages are to immature/ignorant to recognize what parents do for them. I think I was in my mid 20's with kids of my own before I began to understand and appreciate what my parents did for me.
xp4mhkqgaa	I would just tell them it means someone who's never had sex.  |`|F8KmTbqjaa	I would say somebody who has not had sex yet.  Assuming the 9 year old had already learned what sex is.  If they don't know about sex yet maybe it would be time to have "the talk"  but in a 9 year way like the birds and the bees version!  |`|MPX0f5jzaa	I'd say somebody who has never tried to make a baby before is a virgin.|`|nbSp469Waa	My 10 year old son just asked me this the other day.  I was honest with him, told him that it was someone that has never had sex.  Then he said, "So I'm a virgin"  and I said Yes.  It kinda shocked me at first, but then I remember asking my stepmom the same question when I was like 9 or 10.|`|AA11049717	You tell her that it is someone who has not had sex yet. If she is old enough to ask then she needs to know the truth. That also means if the questions keeps coming like "What is sex?" I have already had this talk with my 9 year old. She had lots of questions and I answered them honestly!|`|23jqdYMZaa	AWWWWW AWWWW AWWWW followed by more freaking out then a sensible conversation on the issue with her mom and me. Holy crap i'm not ready for that.|`|PtfaM7jEaa	tell her the truth do not lie to her <br>  most kids know what sex is now at that age|`|o6qWRBlTaa	You have to think, if you lied to your daughter about this how would she feel a few years from now when she learns what it really means? What would she think of you? Oops, I forgot, we already have the Santa Claus scenario to worry about for this. But anyways, I heard kids as young as 12 are becoming sexually active in our present time, so for a 9 year old to hear about this sounds pretty textbook. I remember when I was 8 years old and in the 2nd grade, the kids in my class were already saying "fu__ck", it doesn't surprise me that a 9 year old heard the word "virgin".<br>  <br>  Also, depending on how resourceful your daughter is, she can look up the word "virgin" in any hard copy dictionary or online dictionary, so why lie to her in the first place? It's like putting the cookie jar on the top shelf, your kitchen is full of chairs, tables, and other things that they can just use to climb up there and get the cookies to stuff their faces with. You can't hide anything from kids, not for long at least.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I would tell her the truth that a virgin is someone who has not had sexual intercourse yet.  I have always been open with my children from the time that they were very young.  By the age of nine they knew about sex and having a menses because I didn't want my three girls to learn about it from some one out side of the home.  I also didn't want them to start their menses with out an idea of what was happening to them.  I also told them about the development of boys so that they would understand things from their perspective and to combat what is being told to them by their friends.|`|qygYwdRpaa	I would simply say it means when someone has never done or tried something before.<br>  <br>  Doesn't have to mean sexual- like someone who has never used the Internet- they are an Internet Virgin...and so on|`|rUPjr7hjaa	I would tell her the truth.  |`|KtdlJbrOaa	I would tell the truth - it's someone who has not had sex.  |`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	just say someone who hasn't had sex
KtdlJbrOaa	It is a unique name, but I think he would get teased in school.

I think that he would have problems in school being teased by immature people because of it. People can be very mean, you know? But if you l.ike it, that's what matters.<br>  <br>  Congrats! & good luck.|`|OowhTf06aa	Its okaay...I would like Spencer better..Spicer would be cute if he was a lil chef.like Spicer's Spices..Or if he opened a spice company..yeah....How  cute..Not rly..Its not different, just weird..sorry.|`|L3Q76HxVaa	Not as a name, but even so it sounds more girly.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  please vot on mine!<br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9675595" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9675595</a>|`|BQeNaLGpaa	Actually i like it it's different.. for a middle name you should try Benjamin, Spicer Benjamin just sounds good to me lol|`|sIySBUotaa	not feeling that name, sorry girl. very unique though, maybe as a middle name.|`|MXioLr5zaa	unfortunately the poor kid will probably be teased to death in school. sorry :(|`|nolxYfzUaa	Go with Spencer.|`|RFX2PdO5aa	No, don't like it at all, sorry.|`|nlteggWIaa	no sorry im with your husband on this one i dont like it|`|ttqVUhc6aa	Eww !!!!! But if you like it|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sorry, I'm with your husband on this one.  It is weird.  Closest name I can think of that comes closest to it is Spence or Spence for short which sounds a lot nicer.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	not for a first name but maybe a MN!|`|8ff1197fcf334cda2870e53b90edf1dbaa	I don't care for it but if you LOVE it maybe you and your husband could compromise and use it as a middle name since it is a family name and therefore has special meaning to you|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't like it as a first name. You could use it as a middle name because it's a family name, but it sounds like food, not a baby boy|`|HXfHkoSHaa	yuck|`|tivpa7Vlaa	thumbs down for me....
AA11061445	i had 3 girls terrible morning sickness im 20 weeks with a little boy and have have none,<br>  its just an old wives tale.i was pregnant in april with terrible morning sickness and miscarried so it means nothing|`|A1S5KNUkaa	I've never had morning sickness on any of my pregnancies!!  Not had morning sickness on this one either so don't believe everything you read =)|`|mBeGdFO2aa	Many people don't have morning sickness and have healthy babies!!!<br>  <br>  What I've been told is if you have morning sickness you may have less of a chance of miscarriage, but that may just be an old wives tale made up to make sick women feel better.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, just be happy you're feeling well!!|`|AA11052660	My best friend had absolutely no morning sickness and her son is 3.5 years old now.<br>  <br>  Please do not worry unnecessarily.  Some women get morning sickness in pregnancy, but some are lucky and don't get it.  If you were previously suffering from morning sickness, and it suddenly stops (along with your other symptoms), it is believed that this COULD be a symptom of miscarriage, but even this is not definitive, especially as morning sickness can sometimes go away around the 12 week mark anyway.|`|c790c0f3ca4b5ca33ae20dba3a6be536aa	nope.  Since you are already on your 11th week, your morning sickness will now fade.  Symptoms are different for every woman and not always the same.  Others do not have morning sickness at all.  Their tummy just grows without any signs of being pregnant|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i didnt have any morning sickness at all not even cravings or tiredness through out this whole pregnancy now i am full term(9mths) and  my unborn boy is still well and kicking. so far so good.|`|DDFSITiYaa	The chemcial that is released in the body in early pregnancy (HGC) which is what pregnancy tests test for, is a known cause of morning sickness.  Many women react to this chemical by being sick and because it rises during those early weeks, it is likely if you react to it, it will be during that time.   I think the old wives tales came about because when you miscarry, your levels of HGC drop as the embryo dies which would make you feel less sick and hence, the correlation. <br>  <br>  But many women, myself included, never suffer from morning sickness because we don't react to HGC. .  Some people have morning sickness with some pregnancies and not others because the theory is that the HGC levels can vary.  I've had 3 healthy pregnancies without any morning sickness, 2 girls and 1 boy.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones! |`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	NOT TRUE<br>  <br>  I had 3 miscarriages and really believed that this was true as I had very little morning sickness.<br>  <br>  However, in my 4th and thankfully successful pregnancy I had no morning sickness either.<br>  <br>  btw....my baby from my 4th pregnancy just turned 5 yesterday.....healthy and happy!<br>  <br>  I am just lucky enough not to get morning sickness.....and don`t get seasick either.|`|BcjFssaEaa	no many people have no symptoms, others have different symptoms for different sex babies.<br>  <br>  remember every1 n every pregnancy is different so if u dont follow "trend" it doesnt mean u r weird strange or there is something wrong it means u r a different women to those in a book.<br>  <br>  best of luck xx|`|Bwf4olwDaa	you don't have to have EVERY symptom. your fine :D|`|ukNw9cVgaa	nope.  you're just lucky!

215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Hunter Austin is my fav. It is a strong name. Very  I masculine. I never liked Hunter as a girls name, it suits a boy much better.

wrmfcBpLaa	If there is NO medical NECESSITY, then I would flat out refuse and tell them you can NOT force me to accept a medical procedure and as much as I DESPISE frivilous lawsuits (they are a cancer to our nation and have caused medical care/insurance rates to skyrocket) I say in your case THREATEN AWAY!<br>  If worse comes to worse, find another hospital... Ultimately, they can NOT force you to accept medical treatment against your will. Tell them you will sign a waiver that says you are refusing the doctor's advice and they have no liability in the matter...<br>  <br>  Doctors can NOT force anything on you except if you are in a literal life/death, split second decision type of situation...<br>  <br>  Hold your ground and refuse to accept their answer, unless it's life saving/medically necessary.|`|K6uMahjtaa	You can ask if they will try and proceed with a natural birth, and if any complications at all arise that you go to have a C-section.. it is not right that they will not allow you to make the decesion on your own.. I know a woman who had a c-section with her first and her doctor said with this pregnancy she can try natural but if any complications come up they will go straight to c -section. Goodluck|`|4ec27dca9c261de9c39abd8e0dd218f5aa	Can you go to another hospital? My hospital encourages VBACs!|`|yQWnMSc6aa	You cannot SUE them for having a NO VBAC policy. You can go to another doctor/hospital who does VBAC but you cannot sue doctors that refuse to do it - they are in no way being negligent. <br>  <br>  Many doctors have a no VBAC policy for fear of lawsuits. People in this country are lawsuit crazy on doctors - especially OBs.<br>  <br>  The hospital's lawyers are the ones who have put in place a no VBAC policy. You can try to litgate with the lawyers which would most likely be unsuccessful - but you could try and it would be expensive.|`|TFdhL7LKaa	It is up to interpretation. You say that they doctors will cut you "open without concern of your well being". I say they will cut you open with the concern of your well being. Did you know that your old scar tissue can rupture during the birth causing harm or death to your little baby. why would the doctors want to risk that for.... if anything happened you are probably the type of person to sue them regardless. Why are you so determined to have a natural birth when you must have agreed to have 2 c-sections previously? 
wzmo2Ju7aa	Hmm, Roxas is a bit of an unusual name, but I really like it. You could always switch the names to Gabriel Roxas. Also, I love Savannah Leigh Myona, I'm not fond of Jessica and its spellings but Neveah is gorgeous. And honestly, when it comes to your family, if their input is important to you then you should consider it, but remember this is your baby and not theirs and that you have the right to call him or her anything that you want, and in this case, the names that you have chosen you seem to really love, so why shouldn't you give them to your child?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4U973JfHaa	Maybe have your parents write down names they like and see if you and your fiance like any of them?  See if there are any family names you could use or variations of them?<br>  <br>  I will make one comment...my first name is Jessica and I really do not like it spelled Jesyca...sorry...  :(|`|633f3a8b519b67edeca7960de8dff5feaa	We have kept all 3 or our children's names a secret until after it is written on the birth certificate and cannot be changed. That way there is no bickering, or snide comments. This child is YOUR child and there is nothing that says you have to tell them the name until you want to...|`|o9B4alJwaa	You might want to really listen to what they say and why they are saying it. I had a lot of people question my sons name and now I wish I would have listen to them. I do not care for the name Roxas, I find it a little feminine, as for the girls I prefer Savannah.|`|1KWWxWORaa	to hell with your families.  its your baby and the 2 of you only have to please eachother. i dont like the names either--but you definately dont have to please me!!!|`|xoSYImeQaa	Savannah Navaeh .<br>  <br>  But what I'd do is tell them to pick out a first or middle and you'll pick out the other, that way youll both be happy <3<br>  <br>  Best wishes and God bless :]<br>  |`|xZPHZBQgaa	I like Gabriel Roxas Better.<br>  Savannah Leigh Myona is very pretty for a girl.|`|A7Aa4ycPaa	I agree, I'd change the boys name to Gabriel Roxas. Roxas is WAY too associated with Kingdom Hearts for me - I wouldn't use any names from video games unless they had a strong history of use elsewhere. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'm not a fan of the girls names either, but in the end it's what you like that matters. Remember that when they see your baby, the name won't matter to them nearly as much as the child itself. <br>  <br>  If you really do want to please them name-wise, though, I'd change Jesyca to Jessica, and I'd drop Nevaeh altogether. Jessica's popular no matter how you spell it, and spelling it differently will just make her "Jessica with a Y" instead of "Jessica M/Jessica S". Nevaeh's way too popular, cheesy, and could even be seen as sac religious (heaven backwards?). <br>  As for Savannah Leigh, I'm personally not a fan, but there's nothing terribly wrong with it. I just can't imagine it on an adult, and Leigh seems like such a filler to me - give her something interesting to say when her friends ask what her middle name is, instead of just saying "Oh, it's just another Marie/Leigh/Anne". <br>  <br>  Sorry if I offended you in any way - it's just one way you may be able to make them a bit happier, if that's the sort of change you're looking for. =)|`|Qeab6IjKaa	Name the boy Gabriel and the girl Jessica Leigh.<br>  The rest are godawful.<br>  |`|AA11117186	The only one I like is Savannah Leigh.|`|ZkrJdAZ6aa	I'm guessing that your family thinks that the names you've come up with are too strange for their tastes. I think if you normalize them a little bit it will help a lot.<br>  <br>  For boys, I don't like the name Roxas at all, even though I love Kingdom Hearts. If you're set on the name, I'd use it as a middle name. Gabriel Roxas sounds much more "normal" but is still unique. <br>  <br>  Savannah Leigh Myona is a nice name for a girl. Jessica is ok as well, but it's very common(although common isn't necessarily a bad thing!). I'd definitely get rid of the weird spelling of it and totally forget about heaven backwards as a middle name -- both look juvenile.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think those minor adjustments alone will appease your family. <br>  If not, just remember that once your baby is actually here, your family will be crazy about him or her no matter what name you choose. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|OHfZFR31aa	I like Gabriel Roxas better. That way the child has a choice when he gets older to use a creative or a more traditional name. You can always call him Roxas, but you also have to think about how that is going to look on a resume some day.<br>  <br>  Savannah Leigh is pretty.<br>  <br>  I can't stand Jesyca Nevaeh - the wrong spelling of Jessica just looks like someone illiterate spelled it, and Nevaeh is the most ridiculous made up name of the past few years, especially since in occult traditions, spelling a word backwards gives it the opposite meaning, so the opposite of heaven is hell. |`|SF1uPJZhaa	I can see why your family would hate these.....<br>  <br>  Roxas? "Rocks us". Rock me Amadeus! Gabriel is lovely but Roxas is awful.<br>  Myona sounds like a medical condition and don't even get me started on the horrible spelling of Jessica and Nevaeh is just trashtastic.<br>  |`|0owa0uSHaa	Well I had this problem with my first child so we told everyone in our family to write a list of names that they liked. Then my husband and I collected all the list and we picked off of those list. If there is a middle or first name that you are just set on then make sure you tell them that!<br>  <br>  You will be suprised but you will probley find something you will love|`|AA12134223	i say it is ur baby <br>  you can't please ALL of them and you too<br>  they should consider that they are causing you stress an that's not good...relax you and you fiancee have DECIDED both parents should understand that|`|CApnEZ83aa	You should name your child what you want to.  When the baby comes, trust me, everyone will love the baby and will love the name too!  It happened for me and my sister's.  Good luck!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Gabriel Roxas for a boy.

It means he feels responsibility for the welfare of his younger brother and that he's a great older brother.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Yes, it's fine. As long as he is getting your son clean. Do not listen to all these judging people, potty training takes time. I know plenty of mother's with 3 year olds who haven't quite gotten the potty thing down and need to wear diapers, they all progress at different ages and stages!|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Sure, my oldest daughter changed her brother's diaper when she was probably 6 or 7 (just a wet one).  It's good for kids to learn how to do these things.  12 years old is certainly old enough - plus it's a skill that a babysitter would need to have should your older child ever want to do that.|`|JHqt7Jz8aa	I feel that if you son doesnt mind helping you out then you should let him, he is trying to be helpful to you so it will make him feel good to help you. And it will improve the relationship between him and his brother with his helping to take care of him. =)|`|HWeajklaaa	i dont see a problem with it. Why would it be a problem? and i agree with some of the other people, a 3 year old should be pretty much potty training about now|`|4TaTwZNBaa	Absolutely, then hey you have another helper so that you can have a little me time to yourself.|`|ftdd64E3aa	there should be no problem with that but why is the 3 year old still in diapers? do you mean pull ups?<br>  at three you should really be thinking about potty training him.|`|mBfvthNaaa	Why not?  But why is a 3 year old still wearing diapers?|`|zHJm18rKaa	I love how you ask a question about diaper changing and get told to potty train your child. As if people on here know your circumstances and your child. Some children don't gain the muscle (sphincter) tone to potty train with success until they are 3 and a half. Some children have physical issues that delay potty training. Whatever your situation is has nothing to do with your question, and I am sorry that people on here have judged you with no information. Anyway sorry I had to say that but to answer your question yes it's fine. My 12 year old son helps with diaper changing as well as taking his brother to the potty when I'm busy with the youngest. I think it's great that he is willing to help out. I hope this helped, I'm sure to get thumbs down from the nags I addressed but oh well. |`|GhBHK1Nbaa	My oldest (of six) was 13 when the baby was born.<br>  He changed diapers sometimes.  Didn't ask if he'd mind - even I don't like poopy diapers, but it was helpful to me because three were in diapers at the same time.  He was, of course, rewarded appropriately.|`|kHuyMTYKaa	Of course it's ok...but as you have already been told...the child is 3..he's NOT a baby...time to POTTY TRAIN him...UNLESS he has a Medical Condition.<br>  <br>  ETA...TB...did you just call me a NAG? LOL..I had to laugh at that...that's what we used to call our horses.<br>  <br>  Charli...some of the things I used to call my Stud <br>  Arabian...would have made you flinch...lol!  He was <br>  STUBBORN and Ornery!<br>  <br>  BTW...TB..It wasn't me who gave you the Thumbs Down...I loved your Answer!  :-)<br>  <br>  LOL..Charli...You REALY have to stop waving your G-String in that Horses Face to get him to do what you want...you'll make a Pervert out of him yet!  :-0  :-)|`|i7IyScCHaa	I dont see a problem in it, but you need to start potty training. |`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Yup, it's fine. But that 3 year old needs to start potty training (not to judge or anything-but it is time by this age.)  |`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	Yep, its fine.   nothing wrong w/ that.|`|WrGq35zSaa	Sure it's fine.<br>  <br>  What's with all the questions about why is he still in diapers?? How is it any of their business.....|`|DdLfaEzNaa	Yes, of course.  Anytime a sibling does a service for another sibling it increases their love for that sibling.  I've even had my 5-year-old change a non-poopy diaper of my 10-month-old and he didn't mind at all.|`|LXc9tGJVaa	I think that's fine and it shows that he's trying to be responsible and help out by doing it. |`|6mwtZ20Kaa	If he wants to help, great! Moms can always use the extra help!
KtdlJbrOaa	I like it - it's unique|`|Elxuvon8aa	for a middle name it is hard to pronounce from the spelling for the USA|`|v6nJaXZuaa	I like it but spelled Ines (the Hispanic spelling).|`|80Bzomu1aa	I think it's a pretty name! It's unique in it's own way and the spelling is too. I also like the name spelled Ines much more.Either way I think it's a cute name!|`|Ux0F7WJJaa	I knew a girl with that last name growing up.

410fcc41bc347bf1fb885c265d6c25ebaa	i'm 17 and i'm bisexual. i don't really know, if i caught my child i would sit him down and tell him what i saw and tell him  that if he is gay i'm okay with it, but just like any other person you need to respect yourself and have safe sex. you obviously seem like a good mom in the way you're handling it. if you were my mom i would be far easier to talk about that sort of thing. it makes coming out easier. good luck.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	If you do, just make it casual. You do not want him to be uncomfortable about it. If you sense him about to tell you just tell him you know already. Otherwise I would just let him tell you in his own time. Bring up that you would be fine with it and it may prompt the conversation. |`|PLK1p8cUaa	Wait until he approaches you.  His sexual orientation is not of your business unless it is causing problems with in the family.  No matter what, love him anyway.  Good luck.|`|AA11828439	Honesty can't be beat. Just don't be judgmental! You probably knew before he did, didn't you?|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	I personally wouldn’t tell him that just because he might think you were judging him etc, but I think the best thing would be to set up son and mother date so you two can talk and let him know that you did indeed see him with the other guy and you are supporting him 100%. I think that will make him feel comfortable and able to come to you when he needs too. |`|B9GVxFVFaa	I think you should talk to him.  Be very supportive no matter what your opinion is.  As always, we need to support our kids no matter what path they choose.  If he hasn't come to you now he may already feel some type of disapproval, so be the best parent you can especially regarding this subject.  Good luck!  |`|7SnD5TrVaa	Yes, it will only hurt you're relationship if he feels that he has to hide it. Make sure to tell him that it doesn't matter to you, that it is not his fault, and it is nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  If you don't tolerate gay people, then start to have a more open mind|`|RdIwtjURaa	I would talk to your husband about it, and see how you both feel about it. I would not confront your son untill you are ready to except him the way he is and not be judgmental. <br>  if you plan on freaking out about it, then don't bother. |`|H6D5e9poaa	No.<br>  You should let him tell you on his own.<br>  But, you should let him know (discretely, i may add) that you approve of the homosexual lifestyle.<br>  But, if you choose to do that, i suggest you don't overdo it.  |`|C5jvhCviaa	no, don't tell him you know.  wait until he's ready to come to you about it.  regardless of what so many people think, this is about him and not you or your husband or anyone else for that matter.|`|aZRmEBT1aa	tell him sure. so he knows that you support him...|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I personally wouldn't tell him I knew he was gay (depending how old he is, he may still be working that out for himself), but I would certainly take opportunities to make positive comments about people I knew and respected who were openly gay, or express my disgust with gay-bashing when I saw it, or comment on current events that had to do with gay rights (in the news right now because of Connecticut's recognition of gay marriage), so that I used multiple chances to make very clear to my son that I was fine with any kind of sexual orientation.  I would want him to come to me in his own time, but I would want him to be sure that when he did come to me, I'd be supportive.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes, I would talk to him and let him know that you saw.  It'd probably be a relief for him not to have to hide it from you anymore.
481a43c36ce16419eb0d6762bb896606aa	You should be able to test next week on Oct. 21 and on. The hormones will be present in your system by then. It is too early for the pregnancy tests to detect the hormones in your system.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Wait to test until the first morning after the due date of your next period (so, the 22nd).  If it comes up negative again, you may be having these symptoms because you are anxious about becoming pregnant.

xi7mq1xGaa	Actually Cat, in many areas of the UK it doesn't matter when the child's birthday is, all the Reception children start together in September. Even if the school has a Nursery class. I teach a Nursery class, and one of the children in the Reception class is only a week older than one of mine yet he does full days, she does half, and she's a lot more 'ready' for school in some ways than he is. I really think there shouldn't be hard and fast cut off dates, but that parents' and Nursery/playgroup staff's opinions on whether the child is ready yet should be taken into account.<br>  <br>  Anyway, onto your question. Unfortunately, some teachers seem to want to find the faults with children. It's no good other people saying 'she's the professional, she knows.' She is also human and for some reason some humans like to find fault. There are children in my Nursery class who can't cut with scissors. I don't think that's a huge problem. And he's only a few weeks older than them. Just because he's in Reception it doesn't stop him from being almost a year younger than some of the other children. I don't think the teacher is taking this into account. It's like anything else, if you don't do something a lot then you can't do it. You admit that he never really used scissors at home, and that's fair enough, he wasn't particularly interested. But obviously this is going to show itself in comparison to little girls who might be a lot older than him, and who have probably enjoyed cutting activities for a couple of years. Of course he's not going to be as good as them, and the teacher should accept this. And instead of worrying you, she should be making suggestions that this is something you can work on at home, which you've said you have done now anyway. And some teachers don't seem to think that left handers have more difficulty with fine motor skills than right handers but in my experience they do. My brother, a left hander, went through school constantly being told off for messy handwriting, but he ended up with a First class degree in maths and physics, so it didn't really hold him back! Honestly, all I can say is don't worry. Knowing his alphabet and numbers to over 20 would put him at the top of most Reception classes anyway. It sounds like you're doing lots to help him in the areas he struggles a bit with anyway but if you want more suggestions try things like play dough, threading beads, jigsaws, pegs and boards, finger painting, etc. Also, obviously babies move their arms around before they gain control of their fingers, well this works with older children too. Encourage big arm movements such as painting with water on walls outside, and swirling streamers around. Gross motor skills help to develop the finer motor skills. As for not initiating conversation, I don't think that sounds like a huge problem. Some children are naturally quieter in class than others anyway, and it's her job to encourage him to want to speak to her. If she's constantly finding fault with him then he's probably not getting the vibe that she's a kind person who he would like to talk to! And, adults are a lot bigger than children, which makes them naturally intimidating! After a couple of weeks I don't think it's fair to expect all children to feel really comfortable around them. There's a little girl in the Year 1 class in the school where I teach who barely speaks to any adults or children, yet everyone accepts that she's shy, it's her personality, she still does her work, and her parents say she is happy, so we haven't 'labelled' her with anything. If you've seen him talking normally to others and playing happily with children then just take what was said with a pinch of salt.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I don't get it. <br>  <br>  The teacher mentioned some issues she thinks your son may have.<br>  You yourself have already identified them as areas where he struggles.<br>  <br>  Now you need to ask yourself - how many 4 year olds do you have close experience with, over a period of how many years? How many do you think the teacher has close experience with?<br>  <br>  You know your son. She knows four year olds. Your son is behind the average in some areas. This is not a "judgement", it is her expert opinion based on what she has seen. You don't get to have an expert opinion on what's normal for other four year olds unless you have lots of experience with lots of them. He's not necessarily a typical boy. All you can really say as a parent is that he's a typical your son.<br>  <br>  Did she mention autism or Aspergers? If so then you should be aggrieved - it's not her place to diagnose. If not then you are drawing conclusions, not her. Your child is not perfect and has started school with some areas of weakness - just like every other child, and especially those who are young in their year. Telling you about them is her job, not a personal insult. |`|QfYGhtVwaa	It must be difficult having the teacher describe a child who doesn't really sound like your own!. <br>  <br>  It is possible of course that she is not a great teacher in the respect of picking up on what your son can and cannot do. <br>  <br>  It is also possible that your son is less confident inside class and so can not show his teacher what he is capable of!<br>  <br>  I would keep encouraging him to do his best with the fine motor skills etc at home. When the teacher tells you these negative things, continue to tell her the positive progress that you see at home.<br>  <br>  I would not get too worked up about this, no spectrum disorder type tests have been suggested by the school have they?. Also I would say to  you to keep your doubts about the teachers ability Quiet, just reiterate how you believe your son to be progressing!. It really doesn't help children when their p arents are up at the school criticizing the staff, seriously I would hold my tongue a little unless things change for the worse.|`|AA10529334	It has been my experience that teachers are really quick to "label" kids with these things instead of giving extra time for those children who need some extra help. <br>  <br>  When my son was in Kindergarten his teacher tried to tell me he had ADD -- which I did not believe for a moment as he was fine at home. Come to find out she had told every parent with a boy the same thing. Seems like teachers don't want to put in the extra effort it takes to get young boys to sit and learn.<br>  <br>  If you are at all concerned about him- have him tested privately (not by the school) then the results are yours and the school doesn't have the child "mislabeled"!|`|AA11437439	having had a lad who was diagnosed with aspergers at the age of 4 at reception (although i already had my concerns way before that) i am thinking that school is full time for him?<br>  <br>  personally i think that full time at age 4/5 is too much too soon but the school system gives parents very little choice in the matter (sigh - government initiatives and all that jazz!)<br>  <br>  if he has gone from full time to part time when he is less than 4 1/2 then it could be he needs more time to adjust?<br>  <br>  my son had clear signs of aspergers tho with violence towards his peer group for little or no provocation, obsessive attention to a few of his 'pet' topics and a dislike of unexpected changes.  on the plus side he had a good attention span even very young and has retained an excellent memory for all kinds of things and now in year 6 is considered a model pupil who is especially considerate with other children with obvious problems.<br>  <br>  i am thinking that your school are trying to help with looking at children who show signs of struggling - that is a good sign of a caring school?  it could be that your child doesn't have any additional needs - just is needing more time to adjust but isn't it better that they flag up a concern and it doesn't amount to anything than they ignore a child's needs that are obvious to everyone else?|`|ANnPZWm2aa	he sounds like a perfectly normal little boy tbh. i think your right about the fact that 2 weeks is far too early to be making judgements, moving into school is a big deal and can take a while to adjust. <br>  <br>  as for the the teacher saying that he isnt mixing well, or doesnt initiate play, it could just be that he is shy or doesnt quite know where his place in the class is just yet, especially if his fellow classmates didnt go to the same playschool as him. he obviously is more socialble at home and towards you as that is within his comfort zone. <br>  <br>  give it a couple of months and then if there are still issues that the teacher is worried about, then would be the ideal time to deal with them as he/she will have more of an idea of what your sons strenghts and weaknesses are. |`|tTksfeufaa	your son is fine - please don't worry.<br>  my son's birthday  is end of july so he was youngest in class too - he had no problems learning, but struggled with personal skills such as wiping bottom, doing up shoes, putting on coat ec, so this may be why your son is a bit reluctant with PE, getting changed by yourself is a big deal when you are 4!<br>  Children learn at different rates - dont be too concerned with numbers and letters at this age - let them experiment thorugh play.  support their learning at home in everything you do, and give him loads of praise and encouragement.<br>  the school can support him by providing left handed scissors.<br>  it is way too soon to be diagnosing aspergers syndrome - children are repetative at this age - it is how they learn and remember by repetition.<br>  it sounds to me that your son is a perfectly normal four year old child, getting to frips with his new environment.  |`|3IXDx9nhaa	My advice would be, start him at school as late as you can!  I even enrolled my child in 1st grade sort of year later to give her an edge. Paying off now with 'A's and 'Credits' in English and Computer Skills in NSW Uni. Tests.  Then again seek all the help and support you need.|`|J6Fj7iQFaa	From what I hear your son is a normal happy little boy. Aspergers has nothing to do with ability so him being able to do all the things you listed does not mean that he does not have it, however you know your son better than anyone and I'm sure you would notice a problem if this were the case. I suggest speaking to the teacher and explain that the issues she is mentioning are not concerns of yours and you would appreciate it if she only spoke to you about important issues or any new concerns. Keep an eye on the things she is pointing out as it is proberly just him adjusting to school hence why he dosn't do it at home.|`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	My daughter started pre-school this year...and had some of the some problems.<br>  She is also left-handed....but was still working out what hand she wanted to use when school started...so hadn`t had a lot of experience usuing scissors (I was still trying to work out whether to get her left-handed or right handed scissors). She couldn`t even cut a line when she started!<br>  Now, she can cut most things and writes and draws a lot. I have just realised that she uses a four fingered grip....as do I (also left-handed)! I am trying to change this at home (and change my own grip).<br>  <br>  My daughter isn`t the youngest in her class, but she is the only bilingual child.....and so wasn`t as verbal as the others. The teacher was worried about the way she wouldn`t initiate conversations and didn`t mix well.....but I knew she could at home with me and friends she had known for years.<br>  <br>  I had to stand my ground with the teachers...and over the last few months she has come in leaps and bounds. I made sure she had left-handed scissors for class and I am thinking of getting pencil grips. <br>  Your son has also had to make a HUGE life transition.....and it will take time for him to find his place. <br>  <br>  You could say something like....I understand your concern, but I think he needs time to settle in. We don`t have concerns with those areas at home at all. Lets just wait and see for a while.<br>  As far as the motor skills goes....point out that he is left handed and that left-handed kids need more time to learn motor skills....and that you feel that the main thing is that he doesn`t feel pressured. Do your own research about left-handedness.<br>  <br>  If you feel that your son is fine....I would say that he is. How on earth do they think they can judge a child`s progress after 2 weeks?!! Ridiculous!!! <br>  He doesn`t want to do PE and he didn`t eat his lunch......sound pretty normal for a small child who is in a new environment. Doesn`t initiate conversations? He does it with you...but not with the teacher - sounds perfectly understandable to me. He needs to adjust to the teacher and know that he can trust her......really she is still almost a stranger to him!<br>  <br>  Just keep on repeating "I understand your concerns, but I feel he needs time to adjust"|`|h6hNQjn5aa	Children develop at their own rate.It does seem rather early-even now-for teachers to start giving concerns about children in their care.This kind of thing takes weeks of observations and assessments so how your son's teacher can comment that early on I don't know!! He is still very young-I'm an end of August baby and distinctly remember being the youngest in the whole school when I first started!! I would love to be a fly on the wall in my daughters classroom-kids never tell you what they have been doing at school so it's very hard to get anything out of them!! I wouldn't be too concerned if I was you-if you think he's ok at home then he probably is.He certainly doesn't sound autistic! But you can always see your health visitor to put your mind at rest.|`|kdu80NXzaa	Is he doing a full day already? I assume the school doesn't have a nursery otherwise he wouldn't be in reception already.My son has just turned 5 and he has also just started reception, most of the younger ones won't start until after christmas so it's not surprising that your son is struggling.  I would try to work with the teacher as they are quite good at spotting when children are struggling to settle in. This is all it sounds like to me, and together you can help him. There is a lot of learning through play, ask if you can go into the classroom to help out and see how things work. It is really very enjoyable! If the teacher has actually mentioned aspergers then I would ignore it unless you hear it from someone that is actually qualified to diagnose this!
KtdlJbrOaa	We went to the dollar store & bought a couple of funky pairs & then he wore one of each.  One pair was even the "toe" socks - where each individual toe is stitched - like a glove.|`|Nbl7r9tFaa	get him some of your hubby knee socks and attach pieces of candy <br>  or attach halloween creatures like that you get in walmart <br>  or draw a haunted house and hot glue on a scene....a skeleton etc<br>  You could one sock look like a skeleton by hot gluing on chicken bones etc and make the other one a mummy with gauze and a marker.  So he has a different creature on each foot.  <br>  <br>  You are so lucky to go to a school that lets the kids have fun with halloween still. So many have banned it and it just is so sad.<br>  Have a great day and enjoy!<br>  |`|UY3j47ozaa	1 orange sock and 1 purple sock and roll his pants up!
hl5WdXnbaa	Yes, it is not because I do not trust my child... I do not trust the strangers she could meet online.  My husband is a cop and I know many of his fellow officers who work in internet crimes so I have heard of the statistics first hand. one in eleven kids online will have contact  with a predator .<br>   My daughter and I have a great relationship... I know her friends, she tells me almost everything. She knows I will not go online  just to snoop and be nosey. I have only looked at her stuff once when she went threw a time when she was depressed and upset for about 2 weeks and did not want to talk about it.  I love my kids and would do anything to protect them.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Yes. If a child is doing nothing wrong why would they care? This is 2008. Sexual predators have been using the computer for over two decades to meet and abduct children. With years of experience they are just getting better and more creative.<br>  <br>  I will tell my daughter that I am monitoring her online usage so she knows, and that way she will know she shouldn't do things online she wouldn't want me to know about. There is no breech of trust that way. As long as your son knows you have his passwords and will be monitoring what he does online I don't see it as a big deal. Just don't do it secretly behind his back.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Absolutely, because a 14yr old is a minor..<br>  and it's a parents responsibility to protect them<br>  from predators and other internet crap.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	Absolutely.  When y daughter is old enough to use the computer, we will tell her that everything she does on the Internet will be monitored for her safety, and that's just part of being allowed to use the Internet.  A child can't be expected to protect themselves from online predators because they are naive - they don't understand that there are people in the world who pretend to be nice but really mean to hurt them.  My daughter will be allowed to have a diary that is 100% off limits to me, but the Internet isn't the place for a child to have privacy.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	Yes - I have access to my 14 yr olds myspace page.  You just have no way of knowing what kind of people are out there talking to your kids.  it's up to you, as a parent, to keep your child as safe as possible.|`|siDcjgJCaa	YES! Absolutely its just common sense and good parenting to be aware of what your kids are doing on line. As a parent you have a responsibility to monitor them and keep them safe. Especially at 14|`|HV7pDizNaa	Yes even if your child is trustworthy. 14 year olds can still be naive and unaware of the dangers which exist. My children know that in order for them to have access to our computer, my husband and I will have access to their passwords. However, we let them know that we will monitor it only if they demonstrate they are unable to be trusted or are lacking good judgment. |`|Mfz4byLwaa	yes, but i wouldn't use it to snoop, really.  just check in like once a month since the page is in a public domain you need to see what others are seeing. also, if you notice a change in behavior, sudden secrecy, etc.  it's like reading a kid's diary - they deserve their privacy, to an extent, but if they are in danger or doing something really bad, then the ends justify the means.|`|0VU3LzZKaa	Why not just talk to him instead of snooping? Get to know his friends, where he hangs out regularly, etc. If you have a good relationship with him you won't have to go behind his back. And besides, would you have wanted your parents to do that to you when you were 14? <br>  <br>

I went back on b/c after this, however due to being off it for a wile i did forget to take it at times resulting in a chemical pregnancy.  After this my doctor did bloodtests, all of which came back normal, she has just put it down to bad luck and says my womb just hadn't fully recovered and repaired from each m/c to carry the pregnancy.  I am curretnly back on b/c and am waiting at least 6 months which will bring me up to March'09 before even deciding to try again, i am living in hope that what the doctor says is correct and i am also a firm believer in whats meant to be will be when the time is right.  Please don't give up, if this is something you really want then just continue to try, i believe that at some stage it will happen and if you give up you will always wonder 'what if'.  I know it is so hard at the minute to even contemplate trying again incase something goes wrong again but hopefully in both our cases it will turn out to be worth it.  I wish you all the very best for the future

d1HO25Qaaa	It may be a phase, or it may be how you feel in the long term. Moving in with him might not be a good idea just now, but I would suggest you don't share your feelings with him yet, because you could cause an awful lot of unnecessary heart ache if you change your mind. <br>  Hang in there and focus on your pregnancy for the next few months. When hormones settle and the baby is here you may be able to make a better decision for all of you.<br>  Good luck|`|RSAOwUEqaa	it's a phase. I went through the same thing. but now i hate to be away from him. I can't wait till he gets home from work every day. hes great and going to be amazing. i think once you get a belly and morning sickness goes away...you will want to be with him. good luck.|`|tlK4x0J8aa	You'll be just another single mother who had a child with a man she doesn't want to stay with. Nobody else bothers nowadays, so don't worry. The kids will just have to get used to lots of uncles if your other relationships don't work out. |`|DcffYZo5aa	i think that u may b going through a phase i mean .....if u seriously thought and planned this child obviously love him ....i too get that way with my husband where im like err go away ..but come them cold nights and weekends and love songs playin awww i want my hubby back lol ....i would tell him u kno make an excuse to b away for a bit and see if the grass is really greener on the other side cause come 9 mths it will b and the baby ....u sure u want to do it by urself when u dont have too??|`|XhsCwkrqaa	Your pregnant and your hormones are especially high, its normal to have these feeling and even be scared. My suggestion is to talk out everything with the guy if you think that it's worth working out. You have a while to decide what you want to do depending on how far along you are. It is normal to have the feeling of wanting security for you and your baby too. Who knows, maybe you will decided that you will want to be with him after all. Take some time to think it out.|`|jMVL0nI9aa	When I found out I was pregnant with my 1st child I did something similar. I broke up with the father (though I had good reasons) and then we ended up getting back together about a year later and eventually got married. I think hormones change how you feel about a person somewhat, not to mention you start to think about raising a child and question, is this person good enough? I wouldn't do anything to rash.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am now remarried to a wonderful man who has since adopted my daughter. Her loser sperm donor showed his true side after we were married for almost a year and we ended up getting divorced. But he was a loser and I should have known better. The guy you are with sounds like a good guy.|`|nLTIbIPZaa	I went through the same thing. Everyone told me that it was just a phase and at first i thought it was but they longer it got the worse it got. No one can tell you what to do but i think you should do what you feels is best for you and the baby. Maybe you two need to take a break. Not talk to each other for a while. Maybe down the road things will change but just tell him you need to do this for yourself right now. To make sure this is what you and your baby want. Really if you arent sure if you want to be with him then you just need sometime for yourself to think and weigh everything out. Hope this helps :)|`|Axcy1DYlaa	Normally I'd say listen to your heart. BUT I am living proof that your heart and head don't always think rationally when you're pregnant! I think i've broken up with my boyfriend (the love of my life) twice since i've been pregnant! Fortunately he knows that my hormones are running a muck and he sticks with me and knows i'll regret it like a day later. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying youre feeling this way ONLY because you're pregnant... it could be real that you're wanting to leave him. <br>  <br>  But just from my experience, i found myself not even liking him sometimes and I'd break up with him and say things to him like "i'll call you after the next appt so you know whats going on" and just other rude things for no reason! I just felt that I wanted to do this alone. Without him.. i didnt need him! all I needed was this baby! <br>  <br>  So it's very difficult to say what you're feeling exactly. I'd give it a little time. If you love him, it's worth a little time and patience. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and congrats! |`|AA10458750	Theres no rule saying you ahve to be with that man forever or live with him! Listen to your heart, if you're not feeling 100% about him then don't move in. Its better to have a stable relationship for the baby then try and make things work and end up arguing  all the time.|`|HntAuUW3aa	you don't have to move in with him but at least try to work things out with him cause the baby needs a daddy |`|bl8vA1mpaa	I THINK YOU ARE GOING THROUGH A PHASE<br>  YES! ALL DUE TO YOUR PREGNANCY HORMONES :)|`|9x9WPoNHaa	It's not bad, I think it's kind of normal, especially now that your hormones are crazy. Honestly, I think your mom is right, you do need to give yourself some time to think things through before doing anything you might regret later on. If you love him, it's probably more the hormones talking than anything else. But don't do anything drastic, remember, this is your baby's father. Whether you like, love, hate, despise or adore him, he will be in both of your lives for at least the next 18 years. It's best to keep things amiccable for the baby's sake. Good luck.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be with him, but I do agree with your mother.  I had 3 children - & my hormones fluctuated a lot.  At the beginning of each pregnancy, I went through periods where I wanted nothing to do with my husband.  I would wait to move in though - until you are certain exactly how you feel about him.  If you decide after all you want to be with him, then great, you can proceed with living together and being a family.  If you do ultimately decide that you don't want to be with him - you have not moved in so it will be a little easier to make a break.
AA11061445	was there a heart beat?<br>  at 7 weeks my doc could see a heart beat but not hear one if there is no heart beat 7 weeks is still to early to worry,<br>  don't do anything just wait with my first i did not see  Heart beat until 8 weeks i had my dates wrong|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	at 7 weeks i had an ultrasound and saw a baby well a blob and a heart beat. i would definetly get a second opinion. dont make any decisons until you see someone else.|`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	ok.....as someone who had this same experience twice I hope I can help you. <br>  I`m sure at this stage he is trying to SEE the heartbeat with the trans-vaginal ultrasound. This is quite normal and you can usually see the heartbeat at around 7-8 weeks.<br>  I had the same news at 7 weeks and was told to come back in one week, when they checked again for a heartbeat. In my case the news was bad and the baby had died. I was scheduled for a D&C....although I started to miscarry first.<br>  I didn`t want to believe it...and it was so hard to believe that my baby had died. It was easier when I did start to bleed as I knew there was no mistake then.<br>   I am so sorry, but based on my experience it does seem that your baby has already died (called a missed miscarriage) and the doctors want to do the d&c for your health.  Perhaps you can ask them to wait a few days.....and definitely get them to explain EXACTLY what they think happened. <br>  Big HUGS...this is a really sad and difficult time for you. If it is indeed a miscarriage - I am so sorry for your loss.|`|MVDu7K72aa	OMG I hope you are o.k honey I am in early pregnancy myself and feel for you.  please let us know that you are o.k after your appointment.<br>  <br>  dont get rid if you dont want to he was stupid for even suggesting that.<br>  <br>  good luck sweet heart.|`|O5WberWnaa	hi hun...when i was 7wks and 3days i went for a tv scan and i saw my babys h/b.<br>  did he say anything esle besides the babys heartbeat?<br>  |`|xul847vwaa	When i was 7wks i saw the heartbeat are u sure u didn't see it because u can't hear it until 10wks! and sometimes u can't hear it then!

Why do you want to combine the two names? The two combined just sounds jumbled - to me it could never sound like one name... just two mushed together. |`|bhvW1nMbaa	Long but pretty. I suggest if you do name her this, you go with a short, one or two syllable middle name like Faye or Marie.<br>  |`|lpUYyEbYaa	Holy cow, that's huge.  She's going to have a heck of a time trying to learn to write her name.  what about just Arianna?|`|PdwMd0zQaa	Totally looks like two separate names.  Do not like this at all!

You will FOREVER be telling people how to spell it and pronounce it.|`|sr8r41LXaa	I like it, but maybe Arianna Elise might be a better alternative|`|lInnTHK0aa	No. Much to much. I suggest Annaliese Marie. |`|MeWk0J5yaa	yeah bit long, sounds a little bit like mayonnaise.<br>  Can u break the name into two? maybe better|`|dUFytFcBaa	Not really, When the baby is older they are going to be wondering What was my mom thinking! it is tooo long to start off
222b275605b13f67cc62d39dde66821baa	yOu need to see a doctor. If you aren't pregnant (and I am willing to bet my savings you aren't) something else could be wrong (and I am willing to go double or nothing that it is an STD).  You can go to a planned parenthood and get a pregnancy test and an STD test where you pay on a sliding scale.  Good luck.  Get it taken care of right away though.  Not only could having an STD get worse and worse...some can kill you even though they start out harmless.  |`|eIVy7xkXaa	There's probably a health clinic that's a public health service.  In addition, you might check out books in the public health library.  There are also internet sites on this issue.  It may be more time consuming than going to a doctor, but your baby is worth you time and effort.<br>  |`|9a1901b64759c6de3c15bd8884927a46aa	Could be an STD ask your partner about his area too if there's been something funny lately with him|`|idjrnkVaaa	go to the store and buy yeast infection cream and use it. it may work. <br>  <br>  and if youre that late, and it shows negative, youre probably not pregnant. |`|6UPpG7GOaa	You masturbated to much and god is punishing you.|`|1b97b2404034f11a8990d436626832bbaa	STD!!!<br>  <br>  You got the Coodies!!|`|u6p7UmCtaa	Smell your fingers, then have a dog pee on your feet.|`|sO9l6cxxaa	my xgf had a problem like this all u can do is let it run its course unforchenitly it should clear up when ur period finally comes
KtdlJbrOaa	It certainly sounds like it - I would take a home pregnancy test.  
KtdlJbrOaa	Having a baby causes your body to change - your hormones have been rearranged so to speak.  |`|kfCVRyVjaa	Well you don't say how long you've been trying and how much you weighed when you started to diet.  It may be that you haven't given it enough time yet.  You should be aiming at a loss of no more than 1-2 lbs a week.  Don't forget it took you 9 months to put it on so it'll take at least that to get it off again.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're following a healthy diet (try WeightWatchers if you need a structure) and get some proper exercise in every day.|`|Ve1EQWFTaa	Drink water only.. eat more fruits and veggies, and exercise more.. sometimes chasing after a little one isn't enough exercise to help us lose weight even though it feels like we have run miles by the end of the day...
KtdlJbrOaa	The baby would go to the maternal grandparents until paternity is established.  |`|HvALvdc7aa	I would think it would be the father. But im not sure.|`|TcR4EJjHaa	Well, I assume the father would WANT to have his child.He might have to prove paternity first if the Grandparents have custody.|`|Ve1EQWFTaa	Should be the Father in any state... But it may have to wait until after a paternity test is done to prove he is the father... In the end the courts will decide what is in the best interest of the child.|`|kdL5dgiZaa	Unless the father was unfit or didn't want the child, he would get the baby. Otherwise the grandparents would probably become the guardian. :)|`|RwKeHjUMaa	the mailman
KtdlJbrOaa	You need an attorney now - call your local bar association for a referral to a family law attorney that will either take payments, or work for you pro bono (free).  Custody of your children is not a diy matter.  You have to have good reasons to squelch a motion, and it's not good to ask for continuance after continuance - the judge will become tired of you.  |`|TQW5E6olaa	It takes a lot more than the husband disliking the boyfriend to have children taken away from their mother. In that same regard, it's going to take some hard work to get them back. You need a lawyer, find one who'll take payments.|`|Ylrc1hkXaa	If your eldest child is 13 then surely they should have some say in who they live with. <br>  <br>  |`|8713cc2e67b99221b0fa9404a5ed87bdaa	i realy feel for you i was in the exact same situation and also had no lawyer and also lost my kids for no good reason other than he had money and a lawyer and i did not. my advice is DO NOT do anything without a lawyer. If you have to wait a while until you have money to afford it, then wait! Remember that waiting a few extra weeks without your kids is a whole lot better then waitng the rest of there live s without them.|`|kfCVRyVjaa	I;'m not sure a large inheritance is going to get your kids back.  You don't give any info as to why you haven't been granted custody and have only been given visitation rights to your kids.  This is very unusual unless the mother has been proven to be unfit to care for her children.<br>  <br>  Really if you just go on what you've written, maybe its best for the kids that they stay where they are...
KtdlJbrOaa	Two weeks - just like any other job.  |`|G4qP2gATaa	Two weeks notice I would say, so she has time to find another sitter.|`|l1JPmh5Taa	I would give them a week. Tell them that with the current arrangements of whenever you feel like bringing your kid or picking him up for that matter is not working for you and they need to find a new sitter ASAP. If you ever babysit again if that happens just once tell the parents you can not have this happen or they will be looking for a new sitter. I do daycare for a living while I am going to school and if any of my parents did this I would put my foot down. |`|PHzyDoKuaa	you only have to give 2 weeks notice if you have a signed contract with them.<br>  if not then you can't quit and never work for them again.<br>  <br>  but it would be polite if you gave them a weeks notice to find somebody else!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	2 weeks babysitting is still a job and well it is polite to give 2 weeks no matter the job

z6IekuwSaa	You need to support him in his decision. It is something very honorable that you should be proud of. <br>  <br>  It also benefits you because:<br>  The Marines take money out of his pay and send it directly to you for child support, he will never be able to miss a payment<br>  Your daughter will have amazing healthcare, you will pay nothing at all for all of her health<br>  <br>  If you guys get married there are tons of benefits too. Email me or message me on myspace. www.myspace.com/osurae<br>  <br>  We had PCS orders when I was pregnant, gave birth, 5 days later we moved to our new duty station, one week after that he left me on a DET. So there I was with a 2 week old in a new place, I thought it was hard, but I had a family to take care of me, the Marine Corps<br>  <br>  Semper Fi!|`|LfZk2NGBaa	You may not think this now but this is the best thing he can do for your family. The USMC will take great care of your family and the health care is great. If you guys are pretty serious I would look into getting married before he joins so you are able to get health care for yourself as well as housing when he gets out of bootcamp and schooling.|`|HyrWtJ0caa	try talking to his parents and see if they'll reason with you, maybe with their help you can convince him to stay|`|n6wZV8n0aa	Maybe he's doing it now because he sees it as a way to support his family and provide you with housing and medical etc? Just a thought.|`|t0mb150gaa	You can't make him stay. If this is something he needs to do then there is nothing you can do to change his heart so just support his dream and find out what this means for you and the baby. You need to be strong and know that if you end up doing this alone that you can do it. I know this is a hard time for you but you will get through it and be a stronger person from it. Best wishes|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I don't know. You'd be better off asking him that question. <br>  <br>  But many,many women on here and even locally where you live have men aboard in the armed services. So,you won't be alone.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	This is why you need to be MARRIED before bringing children into the situation. You're not married he has no obligation to ask your permission to do anything. By law the only obligation he has is to financially support his offspring. I hope you use your experience to tell other girls to be in a stable happy marriage before conceiving.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	I know you don't want him to go fight, but its a good thing he's going.  All the benefits him and your kid will get.....child support is gauranteed.....its not like he's going to hang out with a bunch of women or anything! Quite the opposite!....nothing to worry about, and if I were you I would be proud of him!|`|avx7bLnKaa	maybe he feels that this is the best way to financially support his baby.... fathers get weird thoughts in their heads sometimes|`|QNuW7ivyaa	i know the timing is bad.  BUT (as the mother of a marine corps baby, who was born while her father was deployed) - this is a good time!  By the time he takes all his tests and gets ready to go - your son will be in that "easier" phase of infancy where you can actually get things done!  By him joining the marines, hes guarenteeing himself a steady (recession proof) income, with benefits for both him and your son (and hopefully one day you!) If he choses the right career path, it could set him up for life - thus setting you and your son up for life! <br>  <br>  Your son is at the age where he wont remember daddy wasnt there. Your son will (hopefully) be at the age where you arent AS dependant on having two parents around (Mine was born while daddy was deployed - he didnt meet her until she was 6months and STILL lives in another state - so i do it ALL solo, with help of my friends).  I think you can do it - just dont be afraid to ask for help from friends and family.  I have faith in you.

AND THAT IS IT DUMB***!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|11ffd6027fb168eed1cc7ddf2c7c6315aa	It seems you posted this question to elicit a certain response against President Bush probably because it's the only way you know how to justify your political beliefs.<br>  <br>  Assuming that you don't support President Bush, you probably do so because you are more sympathetic toward the liberal agenda in this nation. Therefore, you probably support homosexual marriage and equal rights for people with different sexual orientation. So what's the problem if President Bush IS indeed gay?<br>  <br>  It seems that the left-wing likes to support certain types of people, e.g. laborers, homosexuals, etc. but then liberals have no problem turning their back on them and bashing them. In this instance, you used 'gay' as something derogatory, yet your political beliefs probably state otherwise. Why is there in an inconsistency in your action?<br>  <br>  If you want a better example, look to Alec Baldwin who called Sean Hannity a 'construction worker.' He meant it as an insult, yet his party supposedly supports the construction worker...so why would he use the occupation as an insult?<br>  <br>  INCONSISTENCY.

I bleed some while i was pregnant with my second child, i thought i was getting ready to start my period, but i was wrong. The bleeding was caused by implantation. That is when the fertilized egg is attaching to the uterus. I also felt some discomfort with cramps, backache, and tender breast. I disregarded these things thinking i was going to start my period, but they were symptoms of pregnancy.

PyzUPKBRaa	I don't have a website to "prove" anything, but what I can tell you is personal experience; you can take it or leave it.<br>  During one of my pregnancies, I had a transvaginal u/s done at 5w 3d.  They not only found the heartbeat, but they found twins.  One was in a sac that measured x number of mm long & had a heartbeat that jumped back & forth from the 120s to the 140s; the other was in a sac that was a few mm shorter in length but in that one, they could not detect a heartbeat.  They called it a "vanishing twin."<br>  <br>  So, to answer your questions: yes, it's very normal for the heartrate to jump around like that; and could you be having twins?  Sure, you could be; but the fact that they didn't say anything about that at your u/s leads me to believe you probably aren't.  They'd definitely have been able to find out if it was a multiple pregnancy; in fact, that's one of the things they look for in an early u/s like that.<br>  My daughter is 5'6" & 118lbs, also small-framed, and she was poofing out pretty early too, though her doctor said it was more likely bloating than actual baby.  We have twins in our family too.<br>  <br>  Another way to tell would be with the Hcg levels in your blood.  They're usually quite noticeably higher in a multiple pregnancy.|`|o8OTk6xYaa	Heartrates are not the conclusive way to detemine twins... sorry.  A baby's heartrate changes minute to minute.  It may have experienced stress when the ultrasound waves interuppted it's quiet world.<br>  <br>  There are other factors that will develop if there are twins.  One is the size of your uterus.  1.  If you are large for dates, especially around the 20th week  2.  Your provider feels more body parts than expected 3.  An ultrasound shows more than one baby (though they miss it 15% of the time).<br>  <br>  As fun as the possibility of twins are, be patient and realistic.  No website to pass on... just lots of experience with pregnant women.|`|1udoiFIDaa	I believe that it is totally normal for this to happen. Did you ask your dr. while you were there?<br>  here is a website i found hope it helps.<br>  <a href="http://www.childbirths.com/cypress/fetalmonitoringetc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.childbirths.com/cypress/fetal...</a>|`|1cjdA3Kmaa	<a href="http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OBGYN_101/MyDocuments4/Text/Pregnancy/fetal_heart_beat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/O...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detaillb_for_printer.cfm?article_ID=ZZZC02AX60D&sub_cat=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.medem.com/MedLB/article_detai...</a><br>  <br>  i always use website's my writting skills are poor.lol<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ilUcl2WNaa	Your baby will naturally have sudden increases in heart rate when they move. At such an early time in a pregnancy your baby has a large space to move in and he/she will take advantage of it! If you were having twins the ultrasound tech/Dr. should have noticed two babies but like I said it is early in the pregnancy...I am certain that this is normal and not simply caused my multiple gestation.
V8ySzPrHaa	Trust me, suppositories are not as bad as they sound.  They don't hurt and are not generally uncomfortable.  I have had them for pain when I had gall bladder problems.  They probably prescribe these instead of oral medication because oral meds pass through the placenta better.|`|26SqFq6Iaa	no and never heard of this before.! goodluck|`|d7LpdFluaa	I've never heard of someone having to do this before.  I would deffinetly ask your doctor if it's even worth you doing this all the time.  that would be kinda annyoying, but if it's going to help your baby out, maybe that really is what's best.  good luck, and congrats.|`|75yaELvzaa	Wow! I have never heard of this and I had two pregnancies with pre-term labor. They put me on various medications and bed rest, but never a suppository. I was hospitalized several times with it.  Did you ask them how this was supposed to help you? Look it up at the library or on Web-MD and see what the benefits of it are. Just seems so strange to me.|`|AA12215331	i would get more info... but if its a vaginally  suppository its all fine.. anal ones, no clue..<br>  <br>  just ask doc for more info.<br>  how long do you have to take them, etc
yYujYJFZaa	Sam, are you also having pains in your stomach? Does it hurt to pee? Do you have pains in your back?  If you do, and it is an on and off thing, i would get to the hospital you could be having contractions, and possibly in labor.<br>  I wouldn't take any chances at this point.  <br>  Good luck<br>  Oh i forgot.  If it hurts to pee, you might have a bladder infection. Have them do a test.  Also your pelvis might hurt just because your body is getting ready to deliver and it is dialating and your actually feeling it.|`|mth4sA7Baa	I had a lot of pain in my groin area when I was pregnant and I felt like it was my pelvic bone was hurting all the time. All it was is the way the babies were sitting it was putting a strain on my muscle in that area and that why it hurt so bad.|`|jrrYbhw3aa	When I was pregnant with my first child I, too, experienced a lot of discomfort in the groin area--like you describe--at around 36 weeks.  It was especially uncomfortable when sitting up in a chair at work.  I think this was due to the baby dropping down into position.  My son, who ended up weighing in at 10lbs (!), also had a really large head (off the chart for size/age) and I think this was a contributing factor.  But that's not meant to make you worry!  I had a normal, vaginal delivery and healthy baby.  Talk to your midwife and try to find resting positions that are comfortable.  For me it was having my feet up. The last month is the most uncomfortable but then it's over!  Good luck!
Dza3ZUGvaa	My best advice is to call your doctor office and ask to have a nurse call you back because you have a few questions about your ultrasound.  They will be more than happy to answer all your questions.|`|WHJ3KkJEaa	I don't know but i think it means centimeters and milliliters.Sincerely,Cherylle!|`|jYTZmrLgaa	These are all measurements they take to determine your baby's well being and more accurate due date.|`|o8OTk6xYaa	I agree that you should not be embarrassed to ask what these symbols mean.  I'm not sure myself.<br>  <br>  I do know that ultrasounds done before or around 20 weeks serve a double purpose to confirm your due date.  This is done by meausring the the femur length, biparietal diameter (diameter of the head, abb.

Natural Family Planning is the best, and least invasive.|`|T5Gj3fvVaa	my mom had the same thing happen to her and it turned out it was her gallbladder causing her to be sick, you may want to have that checked out|`|AA11574767	It might be a urinary infection.  I've had a couple and I would feel nauseaus all the time but there was no burning during urination or anything else that would indicate I had a bladder infection, just nausea.
446c5659113692df8e22a106e70fe36faa	sounds right to me.  At 8 weeks they will be able to see the heartbeat (not hear it yet though) on the ultrasound.  Most first appointments are around 8 weeks or so.  This is also the best time to date your pregnancy.  Through ultrasound, thy can give you a very specific date as to when yo conceived your baby, therefore you will knwo exactly how far along you are...no guessing or anything (incase you didnt knwo when you ovulated, etc).<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats.|`|19b74a930bfa44b893b4826066919803aa	could be...sometimes they see you just to confirm the pregnancy, but often they want to wait a little to be sure they aren't going to cause trouble in your pregnancy.....the first thing they should do at that appointment is your pap and blood tests though...if you aren't sure, question them, remember it's your body and your baby, and there are other doctors :)|`|75yaELvzaa	No, it doesn't sound right at all. I have 4 children, youngest is 6 months. When I did a home test and it was positive, I called my midwife and scheduled an appointment. I saw her when I was at about six weeks, but my first appointment was with a nurse. She went over everything and gave me my prescription for prenatal vitamins. I think I would be finding another place to go. I personally don't care for doctors when it comes to babies unless there is a major problem with you and baby. I had a BAD experience with an OB my first pregnancy and have used midwives ever since.|`|ncpl2ruzaa	well no that doesnt sound right at all, when you find out your pregnant is when you need to make a app right away so they can get you on prenatel pills and find out how far you really are and do a pap and urine test, so if i was you id go to another doctor.|`|23a85680ec993c60fd32e09dada51156aa	yes that does sound right, most drs wait until 8 weeks.|`|2SmMzF5Jaa	That sounds normal for a lot of doctors. Mine said come in right away, but from other people that I have talked to that's really not the norm.|`|4Gg2698maa	It sounds like a doctor who certainly doesn't believe in wasting any time. Some doctors don't believe in seeing patients unless they're further along so they can get all the details right, as the ultrasound is most likely to show the development and heartbeat of the fetus at that time.<br>  However, thats not a great approach, as each body is unique and some people may require some extra care in the beginning to ensure a healthy growth of the fetus.<br>  I went to the doctor as soon as I found out - and I was 5 weeks along. The ultrasound showed a gestational sac with a yolk sac and she gave me some medication and asked me to come back in a week's time. At 6 weeks, we could hear the fetal heartbeat. By the time I was 8 weeks, she had everything in order for me - and I got all the care I needed for the starting months.<br>  <br>  A lot of doctors also discuss precautions and a good diet plan with their patients. I think you should get an appointment soon enough as knowing all the details will help you get through a healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Goof Luck!|`|5FktUuz9aa	no that doesnt sound right... how long ago did you find out?? your doctor should be willing to take you as soon as possible especially to answer any questions and things like that... thats really odd that he told you that...|`|9a186f24c2475ddb35038c5be30dfddfaa	yes they usally wait untill they can see they baby and its a fetus.<br>  right now your baby is cells and blood and has no heart beat.<br>  SO yeah 8 weeks is about right.|`|ZcoJqmZ9aa	That's a little strange to me. I know you go in once a month, and then every two weeks, and then once a week at the end. When I was pregnant, after confirmed by the doctor, he had me make an appointment for the same month.|`|ZzMe3HFpaa	This all depends on if you,ve already had an internal exam and blood work and all is well. 8 weeks is for drs to play it safe, but you could have a sonagram as early as 3weeks. Only you know your circumstances|`|5d72d00e596ce5a506a4ea3db9ae0be4aa	Yes it's perfectly normal.|`|MiJvSQaEaa	that sounds right to me. most doctors don't want to see you until after 8 weeks. i didn't have my first appointment until 9 weeks.

o8OTk6xYaa	Let me get this straight...<br>  <br>  Your scan (ultrasound) used your last period as a starting point, and said you conceived 2 weeks after this date.  That is usually the way it works, date wise.  An early ultrasound is fairly accurate, as most babies are about the same size in the 1st trimester.<br>  <br>  If you think the dates don't match up to when you know you were likely to conceive, you need to talk to your provider.  A discrepency of more than 2 weeks needs to be re-evaluated.  Your belly measurements later on should validate the early guesses at your due date.|`|42f738e0a88a38a51293015509890057aa	i dont think a scan is capable of telling you when your last period was! when you are preggers they go from the last day of your last period because there is no way of knowing precisely when you conceived after that...although most likey 2 weeks ish. the dating scan is to confirm that as bubs are all about the same size for first 3 months, they will use that along with you input to estimate your due date.<br>  <br>  your question isnt very clear.|`|iuT4qb3zaa	Your 'pregancy week' is from the 1st day of your last LMP..... for example, mine was 3rd Feb so I'm 16 weeks gone.  I didn't actually conceive until 14th/15th Feb so that would only make me 14 weeks in terms of actual fetus age..   2 weeks after LPm is usually about right.|`|yAWBQ3udaa	You would have conceived around 2 weeks after the start of your LMP, which is when your egg is released.<br>  Your pregnancy is measured as 40 weeks long, from the start of your LMP, but in actual fact your pregnancy is only around 38 weeks long.<br>  So when you are told you are 4 weeks pregnant, you are only 2 weeks pregnant!<br>  The first scan you have is usually very accurate so when they give you your due date, count backwards 38 weeks and that should give you the date of conception. Your midwife will use a little circular chart that can tell you this too.
o8OTk6xYaa	There is no absolute standard for hcG levels, as norms have a wide range.  Normal pregnancies increase by 50-65% hcG levels every day until about 12 weeks along, so by today, your hcG is probably closer to /at least 300 (75 x 2 Wed. and 150 x 2 Thurs.).  I start with lower levels of hcG, but have very healthy babies and easy pregnancies.  As long as there is not a distinct drop or extremely slow rise in  your levels, there should be no cause for concern.<br>  <br>  Congrats!!!<br>  <br>  *****<br>  Just re-read the question... 5 weeks after LMP, meaning 3 weeks after conception... this level is quite low, even in the normal range.  I would talk to your provider more about this, as you can ask for a quantitive hcG test to confirm that this is a viable pregnancy (sorry, there's no other way to put that).|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	Have you been to a doctor yet? I'd ask them about the HcG hormone levels. They will get a lot more higher in the next few weeks. Congratulations!!
o8OTk6xYaa	I had a client who was dialated to 5 cm for over 3 weeks before going into labor.  The diagnosis was based on the part of the cervix that could be felt closest to the canal.  The upper part of the cervix, however, was fairly closed (making the cervix look like a triangle).  This is common for those having their second or later baby.  Sometimes, a provider "stretches" the cervix when measuring, thus giving a false assessment.<br>  <br>  If you're not in labor now, you will probably have a very short labor very soon.  I was painlessly dialated to 3 cm for a few weeks before labor, and once those contractions started, it only took 45 minutes to have a baby in my arms.|`|6d98935c50e0bf009986311d1ea676beaa	I thought that they were supposed to admit you if you're passed 4 cm. When I was dilated to 5 I was in the hospital.|`|0a91394ce1d7abbd0ccc24aa44f6bcfcaa	I was dilated to 5 cm. with my last pregnancy and didnt even know it either. You just have to be extra careful, in my case, when labor got going... all i noticed was a little extra dishcarge and got checked 'just in case'. I had my baby 15 minutes after arriving at the hospital. Please go whenever u notice anything different! There were no contractions or pain.|`|SWuC91Pcaa	Some women can handle pain a lot better than others. You are probably having them and not realizing it. Because as far as I know contractions are the only thing that can dilate you. Good luck and take it and congrats!! When i was 5cm they admitted me into the hospital.|`|pjFBKXDQaa	It is pretty common for the cervix to start to open due to the pressure of the baby on it. You probably haven't had any really contractions, your body is just making is self a bit more comfortable, the muscles and ligament are loosening to prepare for the birth of your child and all of that is normal. And think of it this way, the more you dilate without pain now the less your body has to do when you are in labor. <br>  Congratulations! Enjoy your little one when he/she comes.|`|rLwxwJomaa	Totally possible. I was 5 cm for 4 weeks before I went into full active labor. I barely felt contractions at all. My second I went to 10cm without any noticable feeling contractions. So it can happen. Hopefully your birth will be a breeze, you are almost there!
GEBYhp3laa	It okay im a huge worrier too... but i dont think u have anything to worrie about...the chances of her being pregant because of that are very slim...but if u wanna be sure just ask her take a test....|`|xyjg3FkPaa	You already asked this question last week. Are you wanting someone to really answer or are you trying to get your kicks by typing something sexually suggestive?<br>  If you are serious then the chances are nearly zero. If she was on her period she wasnt ovulating she was shedding the egg that wasnt fertilized and she couldnt get pregnant anyway even if she had happened to have a lot of precum on her hand.<br>  Hope you get the answer you are looking for so you can quit asking the same thing over and over.|`|9188e664bf5dfd84bce1fd2f5a4d9697aa	lol... <br>  Keep worrying like this and surely she wont get pregnant it seems like you would not go with out a condom for sure.
7PNbjit0aa	Wow! What a mess for you to be in.  l would just talk to your cousin (assuming she's approachable), and ask her why she was considering an abortion.  She may feel herself like she isn't coping, and maybe you could provide the support she needs to get help and start looking after her little baby.  The things you've mentioned would be a huge concern to me, and l think you're right to be worried.  lt sounds to me like the Mother-in-Law isn't the right person to be helping your cousin out with child rearing advice.  Also, as much as someone NEVER has the right to talk a person into having an abortion, they also don't have the right to talk them out of it either.  A similar situation existed within my own family, and suffice to say that three years on there is a very unhappy little child who knows he is not wanted by his parents, it's heartbreaking to watch.  That said, it's not your or anyones place to advise this young lady on whether or not she should abort, but you could definately encourage her to speak to a counsellor about this.  As a last resort, if your cousin is completely unable to listen to reason, you must call CPS if the safety of that child is at risk.  I hope this helps you, and to answer your main question, l would say definately speak to your cousin, but steer clear of the abortion topic.  Good luck to you and those poor babies.|`|0A3Cybukaa	tell her to get an abortion.  she's only harming the fetus by using drugs and smoking.   she's clearly not ready to have kids. and even if she had it the kid will come out with a whole load of problems health wise and emotional wise.  and thats nbot fair to the baby.|`|DQZavaJJaa	I gotta say it: If you care about that child, and it's unborn sibling, AND the parents won't take classes or get help, you have to advocate for that child.  Many cities have programs designed to help families with education and support, but if your cousin isn't willing to make the effort, you HAVE to notify the authorities.  It's not pretty, and it will cause a LOT of grief in your family, but if it's done early, you CAN make a positive change in that child's life.  Please don't wait.  We all learn at a very young age what to expect of the world.  Give that kid a chance to know love.  Sometimes the threat of losing custody is enough to make a mom grow up.  If not, that child is better off elsewhere.  The adults will blame you, but if they were doing their job, this never would have come up.  The blame and responsibility is completely theirs.  Thank You for your concern.  Good luck, and God Bless.|`|nynF5phSaa	If the conditions are that bad, you need to contact child services to make sure the baby (babies) are looked after properly.  I am pro-life, so I disagree with the idea of abortion, but that is my opinion.

HBV is found in highest concentrations in the blood, and lower concentrations in semen, vaginal secretions, and wound exudates. Sexual transmission accounts for most adult HBV infections in the United States . Approximately 25% of the regular sexual contacts of infected individuals will themselves become seropositive. <br>  <br>  About one half of acute HBV infections are symptomatic in adults with 1% of cases resulting in acute liver failure and death. Acutely infected individuals develop clinically apparent acute hepatitis with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. 10-20% of women seropositive for HBsAg transmit the virus to their neonates in the absence of immunoprophylaxis. In women who are seropositive for both HBsAg and HBeAg vertical transmission is approximately 90% .In patients with acute hepatitis B vertical transmission occurs in up to 10% of neonates when infection occurs in the first trimester and in 80 -90% of neonates when acute infection occurs in the third trimester .<br>  <br>  Who to test <br>  <br>  -all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). <br>  -Women admitted for delivery who have not had prenatal HBsAg testing should have blood drawn for testing|`|oR0srZCBaa	Simple answer. It is a blood test to see if you have active hepatitis B. You are tested during pregnancy. If you are positive, then your baby will get a shot of a medication shortly after birth to attempt to prevent transmission in addition to the routine vaccination. This will also alert the pediatrician to any special precautions or extra care that might be needed. All of our prenatal patients have this done.|`|x0H0sfcDaa	It's a Hepatitis B test.

o8OTk6xYaa	Ultrasounds done before 20 weeks are typically accepted as more accurate than later ultrasounds for dating purposes.

After 28 weeks there is a huge amount of variation in fetal size due to macrosomia and intrauterine growth restriction. With a certain LMP it is not a good idea to change the due date in the third trimester based on ultrasound measurements until the pregnancy has been fully evaluated.mportance of an Accurate EDC<br>  <br>  Obstetrical ultrasound is extremely useful for establishing an accurate EDC. The practical benefits of accurate dates include:<br>  <br>  the correct diagnosis of premature labor- (distinguished from intrauterine growth restriction at term),<br>  the correct diagnosis of post dates pregnancy- (the incidence of presumed post dates is reduced dramatically in populations in whom routine ultrasound is practiced),<br>  the correct diagnosis of growth disorders- (including a reduced incidence of the inappropriate dianosis of growth restriction in fetuses who actually have a later due date than calculated from menstrual dates), and<br>  allowing for appropriate management of pregnancy complications- (deliver or manage expectantly?)..."<br>  <br>   BTW, EDC=EDD<br>  The doctor has limitations due to the limitations of current technology.  But if you have no confidence that your current doctor is skilled and educated and up to date, choose another doctor-usually those associated with a university that does medical research and trains doctors will be forced to keep up to date and have credentials -check to see if he is a board certifed in OBGYN Or you can choose a certified nurse midwife<br>   Please stick with the most knowledgable ones who can prove their experience rather than get annoyed iver minutia with your current doctor and get a less skilled one just to "get even". -unless the doc is rude or unprofessional. <br>  Even knowing the "exact date" there is no way to know when your body will go into labor. can you focus on something else for a while like enjoy your time alone with the first and prepare the child for a sibling Let the doc do the worrying once you have the basic questions answered he is paid to do that- once you have done all the usual pregancy and birth classes you dont need to obsess over it really especially not now Follow all the usual pregnancy health instructions and take care of yourself!|`|fOv5aisvaa	Ultrasound is the most accurate way of dating a pregnancy, but it isn't 100%.

0FaIUP8taa	Que te puedo decir si ese es el nombre de mi hijo, simplemente me encanta.<br>  <br>  IAN es un nombre corto, fácil de recordar, para él fue muy fácil aprender a decir y leer su nombre. Además es un nombre con un significado muy bonito: "Dios es misericordioso", "Regalo de Dios".<br>  <br>  Nosotros vivimos en México (frontera con TX), y el  único inconveniente que le hemos encontrado es que la mayoría de las personas lo pronuncian mal y tenemos que estar diciéndoles como se pronuncia. Por lo general en lugar de pronunciarlo correctamente "EE an" lo dicen como "jan", "yahn" o "ee AN", pero la mayoría de la familia o personas que nos conocen ya aprendieron a decirlo bien, de hecho hasta mi peque cuando le pronuncian mal el nombre los corrije ense?ándoles como debe ser.<br>  <br>  Pero ese en realidad no es ningún inconveniente para que tu ni?o se llame IAN si ese fue el nombre que ustedes eligieron con tanto amor para él.<br>  <br>  El análisis del nombre IAN que te incluye Dalia Alhelí coincide realmente con la personalidad de mi hijo, así es él en la mayoría de los aspectos que menciona.<br>  <br>  Lo reitero, es un nombre muy bonito y felicidades por su baby IAN.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Esta muy bonito, sobre todo si los dos lo han acordado, es espléndido.|`|09b9a1dbecc6545c0d7908a63ed72c04aa	Es bonito, me gusta mucho!!!<br>  <br>  Suerte!!!|`|3f0d1e6826d65574550f6064665126e2aa	IAN:<br>  <br>  Nombre Masculino de origen Hebreo. <br>  Dios el misericordioso.<br>  <br>  Análisis por numerología del nombre Ian:<br>  Naturaleza Emotiva:<br>  Naturaleza emotiva, amable y condescendiente. Suave, cordial, sagaz. Ama la armonía de las formas y los métodos persuasivos. Le gusta sentirse alabado.<br>  <br>  Naturaleza Expresiva:<br>  Es exigente. Se expresa en forma original en la intimidad y en la integridad. Se distingue por su delicadeza. Ama el buen criterio y el misterio. Busca la aprobación.<br>  <br>  Talento Natural:<br>  Es mente de pensamiento desbordado. Se expresa como pensador inspirado que eleva las ideas y hace de cada idealización una realización. Recibe aumento en labores que requieren de la comunión de su pensamiento con la cosa pensada. Labores más bien cerebrales que manuales. Ama las cosas del pensamiento, más al crearlas que al disfrutarlas.<br>  Podría destacar en profesiones como médico, enfermero, filántropo, abogado, escritor, pintor, bailarín o en labor comunitaria, sirviendo al público.<br>  Número de Suerte: 9<br>  <br>  Es un nombre precioso, no muy común y con un hermoso significado!!<br>  Espero que te sirva!!!|`|TibuOOzaaa	muy bueno me encanta ese nombre desde ke <br>  vi la pelicula Casarse esta en Griego por <br>  <br>  Ian Miller =)<br>  <br>  creo que es muy buen nombre pero definitivamente <br>  debes ponerle otro por ke es muy korto <br>  <br>  Ian Abraham (en mexico se dice  abram y en eua eibrajam)|`|UKxkNmI9aa	Es precioso, además cuando tenga que escribirlo es muy fácil.
