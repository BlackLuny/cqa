0D4q4Q2Raa	I'm sorry that you have to deal with that. You know that rule that says guys can't hit girls? A twisted b tch doesn't count in that rule. This is what I would do: The next time she makes fun of you calmly tell her that is is offensive when she does that and that you want her to stop. If she continues, calmly warn her that you are going to hurt her if she continues. Usually, she will either stop here or tell the teacher. If she stops, then problem solved. If she tells the teacher, you can tell the teacher why you threatened her. If she just continues to make fun of you, hit her right in the nose as hard as you can and walk away like nothing happened.

Otherwise, you pretty much cannot get a kidney infection unless you first had a bladder infection that spread up into the kidneys.  So, if you have not recently had a bladder infection, you can't have a kidney infection.  Bladder infections are usually hard to miss - frequent urge to urinate, foul-smelling urine, itching or discomfort with the bladder or urethrea.   Kidney infections tend to have the same symptoms, plus pain and possible a few additional symptoms.     If you have not had a recent bladder infection, then it's possible you have a kidney stone.  Often, the first sign of a kidney stone is intermittent pain.|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	Severe back pain, fever, painful urination.    Back pain tends to be main symptom.
IMPvzBk1aa	Isopropyl rubbing alcohol comes in 70% and 99% solutions.|`|JINK3IHiaa	Nothing has 99% alcohol, the closest you can get is Everclear 95%, but rubbing alcohol usually has around 70% if you're under 21.|`|YC8X25OXaa	The only thing that contains that much alcohol is pure or 'absolute' ethanol, which is pretty much 100% alcohol.  But it can do a lot of damage so I think you can only get it from chemical suppliers for chemistry labs and things.  I'm not certain, but I don't think so.     Otherwise, you can get things like methylated spirit and ethanol 95% from lots of hardware stores and places like that, because you can use it for cleaning paintbrushes.
aOmDuXubaa	Sounds like you have sciatica.  What happens is the muscles of your core (your hips, thighs, back and most importantly your abs) get knotted and in spasm.  You may have done something to irritate any of those muscles or to hurt your spine, like lift something heavy.  If this is the case your spine sounds like it is compressed and because of that it's irritating those nerves around the compression and causing you all kinds of pains.  When these muscles are irritated they pull the lower back and pelvis out of alignment and that causes painful sciatica and other problems.  I hurt my back before and a friend turned me onto inversion therapy or hanging upside down.  After just one try I could feel the muscles in my abs start to stretch out as the spasms broke up and the muscles relaxed.  As your abs loosen they will release their grip on your hip muscles and thighs.  As those muscles all loosen they will release their grip on your lower back muscles. As they relax and loosen they will release their grip on your lower spine and pelvis.  Once all the muscles are relaxed your lower back and pelvis will be free to go back into alignment naturally and this is what will stop your pain and sciatica.  Stretching the muscles is the most important thing!  Hope this helps.|`|55b6b6044398395cf0baf0b11b60ccf8aa	That's horrible. Back pain is the worst. A few months ago I was experiencing some back pain of my own. I was pretty much in bed for an entire week. During that week I couldn't even walk to the bathroom, I was crawling and even that hurt!     Sitting a bunch can definitely trigger lower back pain especially if you don't get much exercise. Still there can be a number of causes, such as being overweight. If someone were to be overweight for several years, it's possible that the pain could become more prominent in older age.     Hands down if someone is experiencing back pain they should go see a doctor and get some x-rays done. Perhaps even go to a chiropractor. Things that you can do by yourself to help ease the pain is take pain killers, soak in hot water, do stretches that target the area in pain, make sure to sleep on your back and walk. Sleeping on your back can be tricky but with practice comes ease. If you do try sleeping on your back make sure that you put a pillow underneath your knees so that your back is properly aligned. Walking just as stretching and heating the area helps loosen up the muscles. Even though walking may be difficult and the pain is excruciating with each step it is a must to relieve the pressure.    Hope that some of my two cents can help. Feel better soon!

pn88K8UXaa	yes. you can always refuse treatment. tell your doctor and you will sign a paper saying basically "im going against what my dr. is suggesting and no one will sue him/her because of it." my aunt did that. she didn't want to face treatment. your dr. may get upset, but you definitely have the right to refuse cancer treatment.    i suggest reading these articles though.    good luck!|`|Q4ggnG0waa	If you HAD cancer, you wouldn't be asking this question.

I mean they can't MAKE you go through treatment, but they love to find loopholes so that they don't have to pay for stuff.

If you do not want cancer treatments then you have a right to, let your doctor know.  It is a personal decision which is a very difficult one to make so I would suggest that any one facing the possibility of cancer treatments take the time to understand and learn all about it first before making a decision such as refusal of treatment. I would also make sure that this is discussed with your loved ones, parents and of course your doctor.  Hope that helped you..|`|8goEkQ49aa	Yes.  As a legal adult, you have the right to make any choice you want about the treatment of any disease.  Since you are so young, I would urge you to talk to a therapist a couple of times before making such a huge decision.    However:  if you choose not to treat the cancer, you still have a right to treatment of the side-effects and pain-control.  And Hospice, at the end of life.      Very good luck to you.|`|9FIvoZQaaa	Just like the other posters responded, yes, you can refuse treatment.     IF you refuse treatment, your doctor can choose to "fire" you as a patient. If/when you decide to go to another doctor for some reason, s/he may refuse to see you, since you have a known record of refusing treatment.    I would suggest going over every option with your doctor, other than the usual "chemo and/or radiation therapy" route. You can always ask for a second opinion as well. Do your homework, too. Check the internet for information about the type of cancer you have. Check mortality rates and read survival stories.    Before you make a decision like this, though, make sure you talk with your doctors and family/friends. Make sure they understand why you want to make a choice like this.     Another poster got angry when they read that families can have members "committed," but it is true. They can take away your right to make medical decisions if they feel you aren't mentally capable of doing so. That is why it is so important to discuss this with your family in a calm manner, without shouting or cursing.|`|Mula85EKaa	yes but why would you and its better then not taking treatment your odds are better|`|nsAGZtS7aa	Don't Throw The Baby Out With The Bath Water.

RGvNRH8Iaa	OK sweetie, if its uncomfortable while you are wearing it, its in wrong. You shouldnt feel a tampon at all once its in.  Make sure when you put it in, to push the applicator in as far as you can without losing it inside yourself.  When I first started wearing them, I had trouble too, and a lot of times it was cause I didnt put them in far enough.  Dont pull on the applicator until youve already pushed the plunger all the way in if that makes sense.    Also, try to avoid pulling them out when they havent been in long enough to be saturated with blood.  Pulling out a dry tampon is always painful!  If you really must pull it out while its still dry, sit in a bathtub full of water for a few minutes first--that will make it a lot easier!|`|22UexUdCaa	its proabably to thick for you..try the slim ones since you're still 13..|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	you should be using padss|`|EjyD1sXeaa	Buy tampons with a plastic or cardboard applicator so that will help keep the actual tampon straight. also there are instructions in the packaging.

And make sure your positioned correctly which is-legs apart, pointer finger covering the part of the applicator where the string hangs over, with the rest of your fingers(thumb on one side, rest on the other)gripping the part at the top of the outer ring. You remind of myself when I first tried tampons. :] I put one of the cardboard pieces in my body and sat down with it in! I thought tampons were always that uncomfortable until I read the instructions more thoroughly a month later and discovered my mistake. My mom and sis use pads, so I was all alone on my knowledge. I am now 14, and it's really easy. You'll get better at it as time passes, just keep "practicing". :) Hope I help!|`|VzEfgidCaa	you should talk to a parent or friend.|`|AFbyQ0opaa	In order to be able to use a tampon, one must first lose her virginity.  Do not worry, this is a common fact girls are misinformed about. Find yourself a nice "male-tampon" and then Blair's dick pumped harder and faster into Melissa. He let out a grunt as he strained with every muscle to maintain his speed. The loud moans escaping her mouth were muffled by the pillow and the sounds of bad music that she insisted on playing. Her short black hair stuck to her neck with sweat, her small *** arching to better accomodate his throbbing mutton leg. Her moans grew louder and she sped up the quick rythym she was playing on her ravenous clitoris. Blair slid in and out of her *** with ease, he was kneeling on the bed trying his hardest to keep up the tempo he had set. He could feel the orgasm pushing but suppressed it with an inner dialogue of chanting. Melissa bucked against his dick and moaned harder, her voice slipping out of audible frequency every now and then. She began to fumble with her clit as an orgasm exploded from her prostate. She wiggled against Blair, pushing him deeper into his ***. Blair let his orgasm spurt out of his rod. Hot jets of steaming come layered her anal walls in white. It was all he could do to stop himself collapsing. His dick emptied and they both fell to the mattress, vision blurred and panting.    HAVE FUN!|`|1uyhFsFsaa	the tampons you are using could be too big for you try a smaller size if you are not using the smallest. the other reason is if your blood flow isn't very heavy the tampon may still be quite dry when you try to pull it out. i find tampons tend to absorb the natural juices inside your vagina as well so when you try to pull it out if it is still quite dry there is no natural lubrication to help it slip out easily. if your flow is quite light and you are having this problem use pads and tampons for heavier flow.   sounds like you were putting them in right otherwise you would have been very uncomfortable all the time the tampon was in.|`|RiwGi7hhaa	Well it doesnt matter if your a virgin or not. your doing it right because thats the way i do it. im 12 btw. if they are too uncomfortable try wearing them only during like PE or swimming. I think you might get uses to the feeling after a while.

And yes, you're doing something wrong. Haha. It hurts to pull out if you don't have enough blood on the tampon. If the tampon is full, it should pull out comfortably. Try using a smaller size tampon to really match your flow. Or, try leaving the tampon in longer, but NEVER more than 8 hours as it can cause TSS. Good luck!|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	It is normal. I only started using tampons in August and I found them uncomfortable to take out too. It should begin to feel more comfortable as you use them more.

ilzSv9Ltaa	It would depend on how long you have had them and you really have to watch out with bacteria. when you put them in the case at night make sure you put new solution in there and when you wake up in the morning put solution in your clean hands and put the contact in the solution in the solution in your hand and gently rub the contact around in the solution. Also all day long constantly put eye drops in your eyes too. you might want to get new ones and start all over.  Hope this helps:)|`|xeeQ9QkLaa	i don't understand, why are you putting these things in your eyes?? they are not supposed to be there. these contacts they make so people can have different eye colors are cheap and should not be used at all. your eyes are fine, don't abuse them.
73GZMpzlaa	It takes quite a long time of standing with the knees locked before  one begins to feel light-headed and eventually pass out.  This is affected by temperature, with fainting more likely on hot days.  But in any event, the key is standing with knees locked for long periods, not simply locking your knees.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I only know that locking your knees while standing can cause you to pass out because it cuts off the blood flow. I didn't believe it until I saw it happen to someone at a wedding.    I think it's something that you will have to just make yourself aware of and train yourself to stop doing it.

WXpdkbG8aa	Are you taking the birth control pills consecutively or are you taking the placebos in between? You should take all of the active pills and then 7 days of placebo. If you blew off the placebo and jumped right to birth control pills, you skipped your period via estrogen and hormones.   When I want to go without a period for a month, I will skip my placebo pills and begin a new pack. The best thing I can suggest is taking another pregnancy test or go to Planned Parenthood as their pregnancy tests are much more accurate than a store bought. Good luck!|`|LMRaSXFeaa	if youve been stressed that could contribute to your period not comming.|`|cXK9sY1raa	Try another test - they can give false readings in the earliest stages of pregnancy if there is not enough hormone to detect.

KXtLoktraa	You should visit a dentist as soon as possible in order to find out this question. You might not be in pain besides the headaches, but a lot of the time, infection can occur between the teeth and the gums which can cause rotting    Not to mention that as these teeth come in, they could potentially push your other teeth if there is not enough room for them. That could lead to having to get braces and what not after they have been removed.    Some people do however have no problems and can live with them. Good luck at the dentist!|`|46uiaxPUaa	You should but definetly DO NOT get them all out at once, I did and it was hell my mouth was swollen, I was in massive amounts of pain and I couldn't eat, sleep, talk or go to work!|`|YC8X25OXaa	Not necessarily.  I've got two wisdom teeth and although they hurt coming through, they've not bothered me since so I'm not having them out.     However, if they are causing you pain then it's probably a good idea.  Go and see your dentist or orthodontist.  They'll tell you whether they're causing or likely to cause problems and advise you as to whether you should have them out or not.    If you do decide to have them out, they'll take them all out, to prevent any problems in the future.  Just as a warning (though you may know already) it is an operation that almost always requires general anaesthetic.  It also hurts a lot afterwards (most of my friends had theirs' out) and you will look like a hamster for a few days.  But it may well be better for you in the long term - go and talk to your dentist.
Pmb0MeB8aa	Everyone has a 6-pack, just most people have a layer of fat covering them! So it doesn't even matter if you do sit-ups..as long as you lose body fat you will have a 6-pack. The location/shape of them will be genetic. If you want your last 2 to show up, just try exercising, not eating fast food, and not drinking regular sodas. You probably need to lose about 3-4% body fat for the last 2, which should take you about a month of exercising and watching what you eat.    Good luck!|`|NNdkhCy0aa	Physiologically everyone has a six pack.  Unless for some reason they have a birth defect etc..  They are not always in balanced pairs either. It is, as others say, down to the low fat percentage on the body.  I think, from the way you describe yourself, that actually your middle two abs are hidden and you are looking for the bottom two when you can already see them.  The wiki link in the sources should clear up where everything is!  You can only 'see' a six pack when your diet properly.  There is little point in doing endless crunches and sit ups, there just isn't enough resistance to make any difference.  For your lower abs to get stronger you need to do things like hanging from a bar and raising your feet vertical to horizontally out in front of you.  But that just affects the hip flexors.  To really make it pay off you have to curl your hips up as well.  It hurts!  But don't go for thousands.  To lose the last bit of weight you can do the right kind of cardio.  By that I mean making sure that you aren't just doing lots of the aerobic bad kind.  I mean you are doing cardio that counts (cardio just means getting your heart pumping and your blood rushing around your veins.  Breaking a sweat?  That's cardiovascular!).  So rather then jumping up and down, or treadmill work or stationary bike, do some pressups followed by squats and lunges with no break in the middle.  That will burn off the fat nicely.  The other rule of thumb is to cut back on the carbohydrates to about 100g of carbs per hour of exercise, and then keep it low-ish at other times.|`|Lau1sLTDaa	everyone has a six pack, but the abdominals are covered in a layer of fat. you need to be near 10% to see results. 90% of having a six pack is diet, 10% exercise, with slow, controlled ab exercises. i would know, because i have a six pack|`|pIMXHktGaa	everyone has a six pack, you just need to exercise so the layer of fat covering them disapears and they are visible.|`|5kXxr6r0aa	yes, your abdominals, like all muscles, are made up of many tendons. In the case of your abdominals (excluding the lower ones often placed in the same muscle group), there are six tendons, hence the six-pack. This is not something that varies genetically, so yes everybody has a six-pack.    what does matter genetically, is the possibility of having the lowest two tendons become visible, more commonly known as having an 8-pack. the genetic variation lies with whether or not the tendons split or not. more people tend to have the tendons appear as one large tendon, with nothing dividing them. Most people involved in bodybuilding will call it an 8-pack as long as it is showing, but your typical "beach bums" only call an 8 pack an 8 pack if they can actually count 8 tendons just from looking.    so yes, everyone has a six pack, its just that some people have too much fat in front, some people have abs that are too weak and small to be seen visibly, and the really unlucky people have both situations.|`|haAtwu3iaa	Yes, you just can't see everyones because fat is covering it up.    - hoped this helped!|`|Qr0UfKOuaa	I do not.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	From their site, it doesn't look like they have T-coils... which seems pretty odd to me.  Although they are a good company, this is the downfall to the "one size fits all" approach to hearing aids.  If he feels like his hearing has changed, he needs to go get evaluated again.  Progressive hearing loss that fast is not normal.      That said... it doesn't appear they have ANY capability to be used with any assistive listening devices as there are no ports or boot spots that would have allowed him to use an FM or infrared system (had to call 3 different stores to get this answer... lol).  This makes me kind of sad, as they can be very helpful.  What I'd do is have your grandfather go back and have the hearing aid reprogrammed after he has his hearing rechecked.  Also, the hearing aid may have lost some of its power, so they should be able to check the integrity of the hearing aid, too.  Good luck!

346683d356126a2c7bdb62721d918419aa	Perioral dermatitis is a skin disorder characterized by tiny red papules (bumps) around the mouth. I never heard of it on the chin.    However, Avoid using any topical steroids on your face, unless specifically directed by your dermatologist.     Avoid sodium hydroxide, propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate found in many soaps, toothpastes, shampoos, etc. These are a major factor in worsening eczema for a lot of people. The use of natural products will help but you should still read the labels as they will sometimes have these chemicals as well. Also, avoid using perfumes, deodorants and cosmetics that are not natural. The chemicals in these also trigger a reaction.    Use natural laundry products that are free of dyes and perfumes and avoid fabric softeners. Vinegar is a natural fabric softener. Use 1/2 cup in the wash cycle. (But don't use bleach at the same timemixing vinegar and bleach may create toxic fumes.) Absolutely don't use dryer sheets.     People with allergies, asthma, eczema and other immune disorders usually have a weakened immune system. Beef it up with Echinacea capsules, L-Lysine tablets, Vit. C [along with daily vitamins] and Red Clover tablets which are blood purifiers.    And keep the colon cleansed. Eat fiberous foods, Greens and Green Leaf Lettuce. Metamucil or Citrucel daily.      Apple Cider Vinegar -- Take one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and honey (if sugar isn't a problem) in a glass full of water three times a day. Use raw honey if possible. You can also apply it to your skin several times daily by mixing 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar into half a cup of water. If you want, you can put the mixture into a spray bottle and just spray it on your skin. There is usually a potassium deficiency in people suffering from eczema and apple cider vinegar has some potassium as well.    Apple cider vinegar, good natural remedy for skin allergies.    Zinc -- Chronic inflammation can place demands on the body's zinc load that may be more than what is available. A zinc deficiency can occur and may then cause inflammatory skin conditions, such as eczema. A zinc deficiency can also impair the body's ability to heal efficiently.     B- Comple vitamin supplement espicially Vitamin B-12eczema tends to occur in people with a vitamin B12 deficiency.     Fish Oil -- Fish oil O mega 3 can lesson the inflammatory symptoms that are associated with allergies such as hay fever, asthma, eczema and other skin conditions such as PD. The fatty acids that are in fish oil are part of the Omega 3 group of fatty acids. They can boost the immune system and reduce inflammation in the body.Also great for the heart!    Zinc -- Chronic inflammation can place demands on the body's zinc load that may be more than what is available. A zinc deficiency can occur and may then cause inflammatory skin conditions, such as eczema. A zinc deficiency can also impair the body's ability to heal efficiently.   ______________________________________...    Topically,  Your skin condition 'could' be realted possibly to a yeast infection.  You could try to put a "yogurt mask" on your face once a day and within two weeks the PD should be gone due to the  ACIDOPHILUS, the good flora or good bacteria in yogurt and needed in our intestines.      I hope I was able to help you. : D    God Bless,     ' J '|`|8cVrd4qlaa	Okay I use these pills for acne and they are takeing away the acne "natures cure" and this really works better than all the other stuff i had used it has 1 a day pill take by mouth and this cream.You can buy this at walmart for $8.00 or some where around there....... hope it works out for you if you try it|`|37U0P66naa	i have the same problem. i just squeeze my pimples. just squeeze them when you get them. that's all i can say about it.|`|S730dpLfaa	Read this blog before taking any action, your answer is right here:  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best method.  Hope this helps|`|haAtwu3iaa	Water is the key to health/healthy looking skin, so drink LOTS of it.    HONEY is another thing, put 1-2 table spoons of honey in a pan or pot, warm it up but DON'T BOIL it!!    smooth this on to your face with CLEAN HANDS!  let it sit on your face for 10-15 minutes, which every you prefer.  rinse with warm water, moisturize your face (a little olive oil is good).    *Honey reduces redness and acne.            - hope this helped!|`|ZSvNNl1Laa	This may sound strange, but I used Rectinol (in the green tube) on my face to alleviate  the same condition you describe. Only use a small amount and rub gently on the affected area. It will lessen  the symptoms very quickly and is not dangerous to use.
WXpdkbG8aa	Yes, your body is adjusting to the regulated hormones and estrogen. I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you begin noticing other symptoms such as dizziness, a fever, etc. then you should speak with your doctor. In the meantime, try and ride it out. You will bleed eventually.|`|vSmop8Vhaa	On the first month you are on the pill, you might and might not 'bleed' or spot. It will take approximately THREE months for your body to adjust to the regular homones intake.    Since you are now on your sugar pills, again, you might and might not get your period and just have a very very light flow.    Coming this MONDAY, you will be on your white pills again (your first active pills)....a new pack.    Give it two more months (you've got one down already) and it should be able to be 'regular' (as the way the pills are suppose to work). Often time, your period doesn't really show up on the FIRST sugar pill but few days after.     So when you don't get your period on the first day you are on your sugar pill, relax...it will come.     I usually get mine on Wed and last thru Saturday. Once Monday comes by, I'm done.    They'll be months that you might have a VERY light period and times you will have a heavy period. Expect that.|`|700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	i think your body is just getting used to the pill.    i guess wait a week or so & if you're really concerned about it, go see your doctor.|`|b5xJqC5oaa	i can be a false one ... it probaly is|`|2bkS1VIIaa	that's weird|`|Rf2r23sYaa	If you didn't have sex then you're not pregnant, as you know. It's not serious. In fact, I think it says that on the pill packaging that you could miss periods. I missed quite a few of them when I was on the pill. Some women never take the placebo pills so they don't ever have a period. Really. It's totally safe.|`|QKoU0dLsaa	go to doctor..|`|o1irBbeNaa	no the same thing happened to me, it probably isnt serious but talk to your mom just to be sure|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I had extremely irregular periods too and I was put on birth control. I was freaking out at first too when I finished my first pack because my period didn't come until I was on my 4th sugar pill. And it's come during my 4th sugar pill every cycle ever since. Never missed a period. Your period doesn't necessarily come at the very 1st sugar pill. And it's different for everyone.    Have you started a new pack yet? Or you're on the sugar pills now?|`|VzEfgidCaa	I wouldn't worry about it. When I was on the pill it made me miss my period occasionally, even though they say it regulates it. I really wouldn't worry, it will most likely come next month.|`|ldaSfLvFaa	Sometimes it takes a couple of months for your body to adjust to the birth control pills. If you do not have your first cycle on the pill by your next due date for one you would need to contact the doctor. If this is worrisome and you are having any other symptoms with it then you would need to call the doctors office and see what he or she says that you should do. Also,if you were given a sheet with information about the pills you are on be sure to read that. It should list side affects,what to watch for and things of that sort. Good luck!|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Yes it is best to check with your physician but also your body maybe adjusting to the pills or stress can also change your periods regularity|`|hh403SkVaa	i only have one every 2 months!!|`|BrHAp7oqaa	I have been on the pill for about 3 years.  When I first started using it, my period would either be really light or I wouldn't have one at all.   If there is no way you can be pregnant, I wouldn't worry...especially since you just started using the pill.  Once your body adjusts, your period will start coming (normally in smaller amounts and lasting for 2-3 days) and you should be fine! :)|`|hPNhqsKmaa	the pill|`|ZmdLwlseaa	i dont think you have much to worry about. this happened to my best friend, and she was on the pill for the same reason. if it happens again, get it checked out.
6CAsx3jaaa	it kinda depends on a few things . if your young enough to still be growing you need more weight. if your an elite athlete than that might be normal. when your young you need lots of calories to contunie growing|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Yes.  You are.  My husband is 6'4" also, so I know and I am telling you the truth.  You are unhealthy-thin.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	nope. yoiur in great shape.your not too thin|`|E64juLwJaa	No,if you feel fine then you are not to thin at all.  Planets
zNSXNrpXaa	I'm not sure, but I would suggest asking your doctor.   it's a really good thing that you're thinking about this before it gets worse though! (if it even would get worse, which I don't know!)  so yeah, ask your doctor, and good luck!|`|E4hFt3RRaa	Dont feel bad you just dont like eating around others. As long as you eat...|`|tTdhu8Mkaa	oh yeah is it just cause your embarresed to eat in public? I used to be like that. Its just something you have to get over. Good luck!|`|9Q1muFGXaa	You can develop OCD over even things like your food touching. If you are still eating and not focused on your weight then i would say no you don't have an eating disorder. I would talk to your family doctor about it. Good luck and don't worry to much about it. We all have to eat to. Remember your not the only person to ever eat in public. I would talk to your doctor so he could help you manage this issue better for you. good luck.|`|aBqJhdufaa	The first two, yes. But the last one's not that bad, my dad doesn't like food to touch lol and I don't really either. You should ask your doctor about what to do if you are developing an eating disorder.
pRn1h2Hlaa	Cammomile tea works wonders for headaches. I get migrains and it helps with those too|`|LfyaujQAaa	just take advil    hope i helped :)
sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to sleep better naturally".|`|ASkz2SCDaa	I would try exercising mid day, some serious Cardio (running, biking, swimming), so your body craves the rest. This will also make you feel better, release stress, and clear your head..it will also help the body release natural hormones and endorphins, which will promote sleep towards the evening. Don't do this option to late (past 4-5) cause it will have the reverse effect...    if this doesn't work, you could always try something herbal or melatonin, although these can leave you groggy...    if neither options work after a day or two, i would schedule a consult with a doctor, they may give you a prescription sleep aid, if needed. from the sounds of it, your a student, so you *might* be able to get a free consult on campus, if your school has the facility...    hope this helps...|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Turkey, carbohydrates, bread, milk--they all have chemicals to help you sleep.

AA11765949	There is not much you can do, people can't be fired because of their illnesses, I am in a similar position..my boss has manic depression and is on Prozac I recognise her illness and try to be sensitive to her illness, she never thanks me for doing most of her work as well as my own  and at times  she is so unnecessarily  rude to me that the only way I can cope is to give her some of her own back that usually changes her attitude. They need to realise we too have emotions and it's not all about them and their illness. Perhaps you will have to be blunt with her and tell her to" give it a rest" as she is getting you down.|`|7QewqiP9aa	You should be empathetic to her condition. It is difficult dealing with anxiety, but I do understand how frustrating it can be to those around her. I would recommend that she go see a counselor and start medication. Do this in a very caring way. Not everyone has the confidence that you have. She may have had some life trauma or experiences that have made her insecure. It good that you care enough to ask.
DcEBhY02aa	You growed six inches in a year that is amazing. I doubt you will grow much anymore maybe 1 or 2 more inches or none at all.

N84a3Ei4aa	No you'll be completely clean - it usually only stays in your system for a maximum of about a week, and since you don't smoke that much you'll be fine. Just drink some water over the next couple days as a precautionary measure, or just to make you feel better about passing.    You will pass 100% though|`|mqXyDTwwaa	It depends on your metabolism, your bodyfat percentage, and the strength of the pot you smoked. Cranberry juice and water helps, but it isn't perfect. In other words, you might get busted. There's no way to really tell.|`|Y8cc02uyaa	drink tons of water...like lots. it will be out of your system.|`|MKApbLCVaa	Hi   I think you be Ok  But to be sure check  -use a home drug test kit ( get a single panel thc test kit found at any Walgreen's or CVS from $4.95 to $12.95) and use the first piss of the day.  Also.. cranberry juice and water help but a natural diuretic (cranberry juice) is going to flush things out quicker (this may lead to what is called a "blank test") meaning all the creatine in your system has been washed out and you're basically just peeing water. Drink some creatine.
YdjX5fOWaa	It sounds like your stress is keeping you up.  I would definitely consider going to a doctor and see what they have to say.  You can also try melatonin, it's an over the counter natural supplement that helps with natural sleep - it's not a sleeping pill.  Sometimes our body doesn't produce enough.  But still see a doctor.  You need your sleep!
aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	Good question. The short answer: people are stupid. The long answer:     Basically, some guy a long time ago wrote an article that said Chinese food made him sick and people starting believing that msg was the cause. If you feel bad after eating a lot of Chinese food, it is more likely due to the high amount of oil and salt that was used. Drinking alcohol may also have contributed to the guy's sick feeling.     Unless you are allergic to glutamate, msg is a harmless food additive that occurs naturally in foods like cheese and tomatoes. It is kind of like protein or starch. Monosodium glutamate is the crystallized form of glutamate that is used in cooking. Msg is also added to common American foods like fried chicken, ranch dressing, some steak sauces, and flavored snack chips like bbq Fritos. It is used in a lot of fast food places like McDonalds and KFC.     You can buy msg in the grocery store. It usually most effective when added during cooking, instead of at the table. Msg is said to activate special tastes buds that make savory foods taste better and may increase your appetite.    Advertisements that say 'no msg' are basically just gimmicks to get people to buy their products, and not out of concern for the few people who may actually be allergic.
D3hLhqR7aa	Spacers hurt way more than the actual braces in my opinion. So I would suggest not trying to eat anything hard because it's so painful and about impossible to chew. So do not try to eat chips, cereal, granola bars, etc.    I would suggest having soup, scrambled eggs, ice cream, pudding.|`|mwbas9QKaa	you can eat anything but hard things. Be careful because if you bite down to hard you will feel a sharp pain.|`|bqT4IIhFaa	I would suggest that you do not eat anything that is gummy or gooey. Like gum, carmel, candys.   pretty much anything that can stick to the spacer and pull it out.  Also i have had spacers and i suggest taking an advil or tylenol before bed because by the next morning they are usually bothersome or painful.
hHjfoKEHaa	I was in the exact same situation. Unfortunately the only ways to get rid of social anxiety involve dealing with people. the easiest way to deal with it would be to talk to a doctor. difficult i know, but you got to give a little if you want to help yourself. The doctor could prescribe medication and that should be a big help. Otherwise you got to deal with it the way you'd deal with a phobia. Face it. Force yourself to talk to others. You don't have to say much, just a 'hi' to your deskmate would do.   You might think people are watching you, waiting for you to screw up so they can call you an idiot. But there not. When you are next in class, bother to glance around and see how many people are actually staring at you. Normally, they're to busy with their own lives. It helps to fidget with something when your anxiety level rises. I usually wear a bracelet and i play with my lip ring too. It helps if your teachers know because then they don't ask you questions that often in class.|`|Znzx92mEaa	The next time you go to the store there is a vitamin like product that's made by Nature Made called SAM-e complete. It's a dietary supplement that has worked wonders for me. I had a panic attack in a dentist chair a while back for no reason what so ever. Granted I've been under a lot of stress for a long time but the vitamin does help some.|`|WdHyIUVhaa	The best that you can do is to consult a psychologist, if it is systemic it would be better.

AA11565057	Right.    So you want to kill yourself and destroy the one and only person (in your opinion) who is normal and might be a good role model for that child? And you want to do this because a crazy woman who cheats on you and plays emotional games might get with other men?    That's not logical!    You're making this all about you and this woman. It's NOT. You have a child to think of, potentially other family and friends. Your life is not over just because you've had a failed relationship with someone who didn't treat you right.    1. Don't kill yourself. Call a suicide prevention hotline, see your doctor and get immediate assistance.   2. Think about your baby - Do you want this child to grow up without a father?   3. Stay away from the woman. Just try to get partial custody of the child. With children, it's not healthy for them to have two parents who constantly fight. It's better for parents to be separated and be amicable than together and fighting. I would stay away from the woman, but still spend time with your child.|`|9Q1muFGXaa	You should really hang in there, fight for custody. the mom doesn't always win like most think. If need be prove she is unfit to raise your son. If all else fails make sure you at least get visitation rights. Be a good father to your son than when he gets old enough to be able to decide who he wants to live with, chances are he is going to pick you and not his mom. Kids are more observant then people think. He will want to live where he is truly loved and cared for. Good luck. Also if things get to bad for yourself then seek counseling. It helps. You don't want to miss out on his life. You have more to offer this little boy then she does.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Please call your local suicide hot line or Crisis Intervention as soon as possible.

The courts will no doubt see that how she is acting is horrible conditions to raise a child in. You should fight for your sons sake. The courts know that it isn't healthy for a child to be raised in a home where the boyfriend changes every night, where she cheats on her long committed relationship with other guys and lies about it. It is definitely worth a shot to fight for the custody. She may have given birth to that baby, but you helped create him and she isn't stable enough to raise him.     However, the fact that you think suicide is the best option worries me. You should see someone for that and work your problems out with them. But I'm not sure if you really mean that you want to die, or if you think that that would be the only way for your son to have a better life. But I want to tell you, it will only hurt your son to not know what a caring dad you can and will be.     Fight for your son. He deserves the best.|`|dysIWGMoaa	Please talk to me Rae.  I am going through the same thing, but my wife already left me.  I am trying to get help and can't find any.  Cry on my shoulder, I will listen and try to advise.

Please talk to me.|`|D0YUsj01aa	dude stuff that option.    she has too much power over you(you've given her too much power to a degree) and thus you are feeling like this.  empower yourself by stepping away and not subjecting yourself to this treatment from her. she obviously is putting you last..she has feelings elsewhere so empower yourself by making a good decision instead of depowering yourself by her sapping at your esteem and your life and everything good in you. you are a good person ok!!    that decision is to step away. leave that environment. next step talk to officials about custody, how could you not have a case. she has been cheating on you non stop and that is why you left in the first place.  i can't see how you could not have rights    as to ignoring her, forget it. you are just abusing yourself by putting up with that. make good decisions. the real decisions not the decisions living out of your head and tied in with the past.  so step one, phone someone to ask who you could phone reguarding finding your custody rights. You will feel better after that conversation i promise you  you would be a brilliant father so atleast find out 100percent if it is or not possible..then make your next step.  one step at a time!!

4flomCyJaa	If you want to do well at the game, don't sleep for 15hrs. Just go to sleep early, and whenever your body says to wake up, wake up. Not getting enough sleep is obviously bad, but too much sleep is also harmful. Don't aim for too much past 10hrs at the max.|`|jZHzgfGHaa	You can take a sleep aid if you're ok to do so medically but 15 hours is a bit excessive. Maybe you'll get 10 hours or so? If you're having a problem sleeping look at your diet and caffeine intake as well and try to regulate your schedule if possible (go to sleep the same time each night, even weekends, etc.)  Good luck with your game.

vqgGKWagaa	Ok ignore that person don't be influenced into something pathetic like that, it's amazing how many people are naive to how to lose weight.  If you even need to lose weight of course you need to exercise whether you hate it or not, starving yourself will not work because as soon as you start to eat again you will probably gain more weight than you lost because your body will go in to 'survival' mode and will store more food than it usually would've because it will be scared of being starved again. As boring as it is a healthy diet and exercise are the best most effective ways to lose weight and keep it off and this should be the method you follow. See your doctor or a dietician first and they can tell you a plan that would work for you.|`|JoIyi9gsaa	eat little and often around 800 - 1000 caloires )    hardly no carbs and mostly veg ( no sugar and no wheat works really well )     yeah and low fat yoghurt works ( burns fat and is a great natrual duretic)    carrots bloat me....|`|fqnmZ23taa	Lazy *****....|`|PNLwOIOraa	Starve your self!|`|7tLDdtqGaa	stop eating. eat only lettuce and carrots and yogurt.|`|GXnfJfU8aa	No pain no gain.

Oh and don't forget eating foods like baby carrots, celery, and apples with peanut butter and hummus for a dip instead of foods like chips and creamy dip.|`|hjNbiqMiaa	well, doing excessive amounts of coke will curb that appetite, which in turn will make you not want to eat, which is turn will make you skinny and there fore you would not have to excerise.

ptGhiqe3aa	Well, I'm a girl and it's pretty gross when I see a guy in class with a *****, but my good friend, who's a guy... told me that it just randomly happens.   He usually flips it up into his waistband (haha!) and just waits it out.    There's really no way to get rid of it i guess, like if you try not to think about it.. it'll come into your mind even more.  unavoidable.  just try and act casual about it and dont make a big deal or like try to be tough and not hide it, becasue girl's will notice and then they will talk about it with their friends later.    good luck.|`|HBvsCZmLaa	hey,    you could try jerking off before school or when you do get one at school goto the bathroom and jerk off..  also try wearing jox instead of boxers, usally helps to keep it down when you get hard.|`|1HnD9yylaa	normal|`|bLAwx3uvaa	Think of naked dudes.|`|jVD2zg8caa	put it side ways in your pants!|`|8lDmtlOcaa	i'm a girl and i'm 17 and i've never noticed a guy having one, so i'm guessing girls won't notice. but ummm idk, thinking about something disgusting like raw meat or poop usually turns people off, right?|`|buLYCudWaa	See if one of the chicks will take care of it.|`|B667elmWaa	It's absolutely normal for boys in their teens.

goksyck9aa	Why can't you lose it before you go through puberty? It wouldn't be right in my opinion, I mean what 10 year do you know that wants to have sex. And about the anal part.... um no. Your *** has nothing to do with losing virginity... at all. Its another form of sex that has nothing to do with a hymen that has to break in order for you or anyone else to lose their virginity. If you want to have sex before you hit puberty then thats your decision just don't be stupid about it.|`|DZJS59Jdaa	No. It is kept safe and locked away in both cases until you are ready. I know.
vSmop8Vhaa	It can be that you are stressed and are not building that much of a 'wall of blood' (to put it in simple terms) for you to shed each time you have your period.    Your menstrual cycle is also based on your lifestyle as well.    My mom and her mom are the same way. Very short period (grandma had 10 kids, mom had 2....I have none....but long & painful/cramping periods).    If it further concerns you, I would drop by a free clinic and they can do a quick screening for you :)|`|BNpIvD2Haa	you are a very very lucky woman.  i saw on tv that anything between 2 and 11 days is normal so i'm sure you're fine!|`|088b2f23da252d7364143178b0433b20aa	This is completely normal. A woman's cycle is unique and can last from around 2 days to 7. Although most women usually last around 4 days on their period, anything in that range is normal.|`|96RDuDofaa	Well, is your flow heavy during those two days? If so, it is perfectly normal for it be short. Even if it isn't all that heavy, its still normal for it to only last two days because everyone menstruates at their own pace.  Good luck..|`|Wgf5Wrfjaa	It can be perfectly normal for a short cycle. If you are really concerned find a family planning clinic. They might put you on BC to straighten out your cycle if there is something wrong with it which can be helpful if you plan on eventually having children. But most likely there is nothing wrong but it never hurts to be certain especially if it worries you.|`|b05fe691e5ceb5cc16ca919cd11e5eccaa	I too am the same way and wonder about it often. If you think something might seriously be wrong you should consider seeing a doctor. Hope this helps.
XzLUA7ataa	The mood swings that you are experiencing are not healthy.  So, yes, by all means tell your Mom.  Ask if she can make an appointment for you to seek professional help with the sadness and the high and low feelings that you are describing.|`|g3MBOYDPaa	I would tell her exactly what you are feeling. Say "Look ma, I feel really crappy and depressed a lot of the time and then out of nowhere I feel fine like nothing is bothering me and then I feel like crap again. Whats going on ma?" If she doesn't give you a good reason for why you feel this way then go to your family doctor and talk to him/her? Mood swings like that might show and underlying problem. Hope you feel better soon!!|`|jTM6Upm5aa	" Mom, I`m having strange mood swings, I`m scared, please help me", start with that. If she doesn`t respond, talk to a professional.
AA10977218	hot compresses work, and there are drops you can buy at the pharmacy. usually though its due to a clogged hair folicle. so the compress will at least make it feel better. it should go away in a few days. don't wear makeup or contacts.  and always always ask your doctor before following anyone's advice.|`|1TradJBIaa	get a hot, wet, wash cloth and hold it with a little pressure on your sty for like ten-fiteen minutes. It helps|`|xWEVX5qSaa	you don't need to go to the doctor try a hot compress because a sty is basically like a zit but in your eye|`|xRxaVMI1aa	A Stye is a clogged oil gland in the lid that can get infected. The medical term is a chalazion. If this happens, it gets red, swollen, sore. If it's not infected you can just use hot packs a few times a day to help get the oil moving. Also, there is a good scrub solution called Sterilid that is over the counter. If it is infected you should see a doctor to get a good medicine that can penetrate the skin of the lid.|`|pIMXHktGaa	go to your doctor and have them presscribe cream for it. thats what they did for me.|`|tpY1A9M8aa	i get them a lot and i use a hot compress|`|g2lFmtqeaa	I have a friend who uses baby shampoo on her sty.

AA11305153	Everyone bleeds a different amount during their menstration.  The average is about 2 tbsp. a day.  Of course this is going to vary depending on age, weight, lifestyle and how far along into your period you are.  Some menses are lighter than others.

On my first day, I will bleed through a tampon and a pad in 20 minutes.  Birth control can help.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	it is normal. Every women has a different flow when they have their period.

My friend and I used to have to use TWO pads on our period at a time!   Something that can help this is birth control :) You may want to ask your doctor about trying that...it's help keep you regular and reduce cramps also!    :]|`|J47FzOQmaa	well they say a teaspoon aint that a lie! i bleed heavily too|`|m2T75uOYaa	Actually, you only "pass" about 2-4 Tbls. of blood during your period. It varies for every person, so don't be alarmed. Hope I help!|`|TIbVnfIgaa	yup, its different with every girl :)|`|I2tsgufaaa	it can be, depending how often and how long your periods last. How long have you had it? How long has it been heavily bleeding?|`|QQvzOu1saa	yes it is normal, it all depends on the person.|`|NArS7hYEaa	It varies between people. if your drinking a lot of water, that could be it. some woman just spot, and others bleed alot. don't worry about it. it's normal.|`|F1d4i4WSaa	everyone bleeds differently. I use to bleed very very heavy. so yes it is normal. But if your concerned talk to your mom or sister or Dr.|`|kUXelHWIaa	That is completly normal. I have to change my tampon at least 6 times a day.

If your periods are really long and you bleed heavily the whole time, you might could see your doctor.  But yes...it is normal to have heavy periods.

JoIyi9gsaa	70 pounds is way to much hun, don't be dramatic, for your height losing 40 pounds is really good.  Id say 1 hour of cardio a day, weather its walking and running together, jogging at a good pace or rowing. you will see very good results if you were to even try this for just a mouth. remember losing weight is a big thing on the body, so be persistent and patient while eating well of course.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	70 lbs is way to much  your kidna tall and then ull be way to skinny  a good goal would be 130 at most  the best sport to do is swimming because it works your whole body and is easy on your joints.  do a lot of situps a day and stay off all the crap food. its garbage|`|4qh1FkXMaa	1 hour or more depending on your current stamina you have.
9Q1muFGXaa	Well I'm sorry to hear about how upset you are. Some of the people on myspace I can tell you that it is for a show. They put on there what they want people to see.  The people you are seeing that are all happy and seems life has been so easy for them may not be the case. Not many people are going to get a myspace account and post only bad things about there life and how crappy it is for them. I have a myspace and i suppose it seems i have a happy fullfilled life and that's not really the case. i hope you understand what i'm trying to say. Life is hard and how we live through the hard times is what makes you who you are as a person. So when you see people that you want to hate because how good they try to make their life seem so wonderful and easy, just remember you see only what they want you to see. There will always be someone's life who is better than yours and at the same time there will always be someone's life who is worse than yours. Just live your life the best you can and don't focus on other people who you don't even know. There are always people to listen when you need to talk. I am usually on myspace a lot and respond to every message i get no matter how well i know them or not. My life has been at its worse the past 2 yrs and i'm bi-polar so things are more challenging for me to deal with. I don't mention on myspace all the crap that goes on in my life. Most would never know that my younger brother sued our mom and she is now serving 2 yrs in prison. Long story. You dont find many people who air out there dirty laundry. myspace is to make friends and find old friends, not to see whose life is worse. hope this helped.|`|nci2WOYXaa	Yeah, I just went back on to facebook today after feeling so uncomfortable with it that I just had to cancel. The few friends I do have told me to sign back on though cause they think it would be good for me. I'm ADD.|`|AA11565057	This rant looks like one giant symptom of your borderline personality disorder. You're devaluing people you don't even know, assuming they're alpha males when you have no idea and they've never spoken to them. You look at photos of them smiling and assume they have no problems.    You're 31. Grow up. Really.     You are not the only one who has had problems. It sounds like your life hasn't been at all easy, but your emotions and responses to events are your responsibility, not anyone elses. Just because other people don't wear their hearts on their sleeves and tell everyone what a rotten life they've had doesn't mean they've not been through bad things. It just means they cope in a more healthy manner than you!    If you don't like browsing myspace, stay away from it. That's bleedingly obvious.|`|pr40exIGaa	Ya know..it is all in your mind..simply use your self to enpower you not to tear your self up.    at the end of the day we are all equal many people have troubles it is just that many keep them masked up and lash out many many diffrent ways act certain ways to compensate their underlying problems..which they refuse to let out.    and then theres some who are genualy successfull people but do not be jeouls, life is complicated ? for me yes i base the way i feel from how others feel i stay equal to. most the time im battling inside my mind for my identity..wanting no fears...wanting to fullfill my desires/feelings. i cant seem to let it all out. i only see in black and white ( everything all at once or nothing at all)....you see no one is perfect just keep marching along :D    "Beliefs are such an important factor of success that you must learn to get rid of the negative, self-limiting ones and create positive, self-enabling beliefs. If programming creates your beliefs, and your beliefs guide your actions,  and your actions create your reality, wouldnt it make sense to get rid of the negative programming?"

You should have no problem using tampons though.

WXpdkbG8aa	Your body will get rid of the urine as long as your drinking water. Water is very healthy though. It cleanses your system and urinating is your body's way of disposing of all of the toxins and waste that are inside of your body. While it may be a nuisance, I would keep up with it because it's totally worth it. Keep an eye on the color of your urine. The lighter of a yellow it becomes, the healthier your body is! Good luck!|`|38f1f2503fc6c449546776a1a667e539aa	Water is good for your skin, hair, health, nails, bones and gives oxygen to the brain and blood.    Keep drinking more. Although you will go the bathroom a lot you will be eliminating waste the water is cleaning through your body.  If you want to go to the loo less, then limit intake of water.    Thanks.

I would think the medications would be milder, but again, I do not know.      Very good luck to you -- I know this is a tough time to be going through.
RGvNRH8Iaa	People are answering thinking you are asking about a colonoscopy, not a colposcopy!    You will not be given any meds unfortunately.  I had one and it sucked, but honestly it was no worse than a regular Pap smear, really!  It just sucked for me cause I think normal Pap smears are extremely painful.  They will put the speculum inside you (just like a pap smear) and the doctor will actually use a light and look at your cervix to check for any obvious abnormalities.  If they see anything suspicious (or sometimes even if they dont), they will take a biopsy on the spot, but to me that was no more painful than when they scrape your cervix during a Pap smear.  I think the only real difference between a colpo and a Pap was the colpo took a bit longer.    good luck, I hope it turns out ok!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	i'm supposed to have one but keep putting it off. friends tell me the worst thing is the prep, when you have to clean yourself out and you're on the toilet for the entire day. they put you under now for the test itself. i'm sure they'd do a biopsy right then and there....    From what i gather they stick the scope in and look at everything for abnormalities, growths etc.    Some day I'll get mine....naw.    good luck!|`|ojEkgJoqaa	they give you meds to make you woosy and you don't remember anything at all.  if they do a biopsy it is done during the procedure.    it is no big thing and you won't remember a thing|`|GItb4cxmaa	No, but I've had an endoscopy. It's basically the same thing, but they looked at my esophagus and stomach instead of colon.    They do the biopsy right there and then. You won't have to go back especially for it. Basically they knock you out, then they just proceed. It only takes about 15 minutes, and then will also snip any polyps IF they even find any. The day before the procedure, you will have to drink a lot of laxatives so that you clean out your system fully.|`|lzcglDnMaa	They will do the biopsy when they do the colposcopy. Expect to bleed after that and have some grayish looking discharge. You will also feel really crampy like sensations. Nothing that ibuprophen or tylenol won't fix. I had mine done at the hospital and they put me to sleep. I was in pain when I woke up, but after taking a pain pill I was fine. Good luck to you.

It isn't curable so while you might not always have a sore you will always be able to spread it and you will probably get one again. Just use blistex or something on it.

However, to get a pretty good idea, you can visit sites such as http://www.americanheart.org or http://www.nutritiondata.com/ both of which have nutrition calculators that pull the different factors into account.    I hope this helps.  Of course, before starting any diet plan, you should always consult with your physician.|`|C2M2StR1aa	No one should go under about 1200.    Your body burns a certain amount of calories each day whether you exercise or not. We each have what is called a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This rate gradually decreases with age.  To the BMR you add the total calories used during the day due to all exercise and activity, which gives you your Active Metabolic Rate.     I am 6', 170 lbs and 52 years old. My basal metabolic rate is about 1700 calories burned per day. To that number I can add whatever calories I burn during the day due to activity and exercise. That will tell me approximately how many total calories I will burn up in a day.     Once you know this number you can eat however many calories you choose in order to lose, gain or maintain your weight.   You burn about 3500 more calories than you consume to lose a pound.     I have a page posted at my website that explains this further.  You can also input your own info to see your own numbers as far as calories used in a day.     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...     Good health and good luck!

I had to pressure my dermatologist to give me it, you must have very bad acne, and you have to have failed atleast 3 other acne treatments by your doctor.

8jKvUJISaa	Hi,    I have a three year old and you wouldn't know it because I used a stretch mark cream to get rid of my stretchmarks!  People don't think a stretch mark cream will work but it does.  I didn't just buy the first stretch mark cream I saw though--I performed an online search and did some comparison shopping.  I then visited http://www.stretchmark.org to get an idea of all the different types of creams viable and located Revitagen the brand I used. If you follow the directions Revitagen work pretty fast.  I picked Revitagen as it was the most highly regarded and reviewed stretch mark cream available!  Check out this Revitagen review at the link below, and see if it will work for you -- it did for me!|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Bio Oil or Palmer's range of creams and lotions for stretchmarks... chemists and supermarkets sell them readily.|`|T0m0gZAtaa	Brush your skin with a loofah or skin brush when you shower to stimulate circulation.    Massage cocoa butter into the stretch marks.    Use vitamin E oil on your stretch marks. Massage it into your skin after a shower.    Talk to your doctor about using tretinoin cream on stretch marks. It is available by prescription only.    Eat foods high in vitamins A, E and C (see Related eHows), or take supplements in addition to your diet. However, pregnant women should avoid taking more than 25,000 IU of vitamin A.    Add foods or supplements to your diet that are high in zinc (see Related eHow), which is good for the skin, and silica (beets, brown rice, bell peppers, soybeans, leafy green vegetables and whole grains), which helps form collagen, the supporting fibers in the skin.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	bio oil|`|hjNbiqMiaa	Cocoa and Shea Butter lotion.  Works wonders.  You have to use it religiously for a month or so, but you will start to notice that the stretch marks will fade because the elastic in your skin will start to be rejuvenated.
QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them. So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well). Look for specific butt workouts, i.e. http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout... and others.|`|Cha4lyL9aa	Im losing inches at the moment on my thighs, bum and hips too.

Inner thighs, sit on the floor knees slightly bent, arms together slightly bent in between ur legs, open arms, thus makin ur legs open then pulling arms against ur legs, squeeze ur legs closed against ur arms. (hope u can work out what i mean sorry)   this will work the inner muscles at the top of ur legs.  do these 3 times a week with day of rest in between.

Stretch your legs and arms any way you are accustomed to. Stretching is key in developing muscles.    * Start with squats. Do 15 repetitions.    * Go down on your exercise mat and do the donkey kick. (15 reps for your right leg and then 15 reps for your left)    * Lie down flat on your front and do leg raises. You could also lift alternate arms if you want to but its optional. (15 reps for both legs)    * Lastly target the calf by doing 20 reps of calf raise workout. For maximum effect, stand on a stack of books or stairs but it can also be done on the floor.    * Now stretch your legs and do all 4 workouts again with the same amount of reps for each. After that, you're all done! Keep doing this workout AT LEAST 3 times a week and you will see results in 2 weeks if not sooner.
1oBilGHuaa	When you first notice any signs of anxiety, try to nip it in the bud before it has a chance to build up.  Be sure to breathe slowly and deeply.  Inhale to the count of eight and then exhale to the count of eight.  Try to relax all the muscles in your body.  Let your mind go blank.  I hope you can take charge of your anxiety instead of your anxiety taking charge of you.  Best Wishes.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Panic attacks are caused because of too much stress, negative thinkings and because tha attack increases the anxiety.    try to relax realizing that your are suffereing an attack: think positively, breathe calmely saying to yourself: It's ok, I'm having an anxiety attack but I'm going to overcom it, I'm right, I'm brreathing calmely, I'm relax...If you feel very bad and there is someone near you ask for help.    If the panic attack is very strong go to a hospital for a diagnosis.    If your are under a big stress, try different ways to get free from that stress.|`|2SgsPKF9aa	I have suffered from panic attacks most of my life and my 25 yr old son does also. We both take anti-anxiety meds to help as they are severe. When you are having one, first is go to a different place than where you are. If inside, go outside and just walk and breathe.If not open a window and breathe the air. If you can tell someone, just tell them what you are experiencing and just ask them to talk with you for a while. Sometimes listening to music or watch something funny on tv helps.You can also call a hotline and just talk with someone and they will get you through it. It is a scary feeling and you think you are going to die but you won't, just find the best way for you.And some people look at you like you have 2 heads and are a nut but this is a very real disorder that is frightening.Good luck.|`|6CAsx3jaaa	try breathing into a paper bag to slow your breathing.|`|RFn0AiSnaa	there is nothing you can do because everyone is out to get you|`|eWk2AMsVaa	Guitar Hero.

I take xanax and valium. The first one I had I had no idea what it was and it scared me. Now I can pretty much tell when it comes on. At times I have woken up with a panic attack. Walking around and just going to a different area does help to. Just find what works best for you. Definately keep a paper bag with you if you happen to hyper ventalate. Definately tell someone.

m9riBMMGaa	no positives. You have increased mucous in your lungs, which makes you cough a lot----oftentimes people have to slap your back to get the mucous out. Also, it causes constipation because the mucous in the bowels thickens. Chronic coughing. Since there is so much mucous, patients with CF often get bacterial infections because the mucous is an excellent medium for baterial growth.
6DfqKpOXaa	I have used the pyramid program for bench and if followed correctly it is highly effective. it has a chart where you find your max and then do sets of 12, 8x,6x,4x,3x,2x and a 5x5 set. you are not supposed to be able to finish the workout it is designed for you to fail. if you are able to complete all of the sets you need to move onto the next max program. we do this at school for weight training and in our football lifting workouts. try googling it for the exact weight and the chart.

GBG2hbQ4aa	You could choke...that's the truth.  Physiologically, your throat is designed with two tubes...the trachea which allows air flow into your lungs, and the esophagus which takes food down into the stomach.  There is a valve that closes the trachea off when you are swallowing food; keeps the food going where it's supposed to go.      When you talk, your airway gets involved in the action.  So you can cause that valve to open the trachea at a time when it needs to be closed.  Food goes down your airway, and chokes you (at the very least).  Food can get into your lungs and not come back out.  That food can cause a serious respiratory infection (such as pneumonia).    Not to mention, it is gross to see the contents of someone's mouth while they are eating.  Blah.|`|XzLUA7ataa	You could choke!|`|cd4f6915efe98bd45a2247d1ad1e9fbaaa	Its gross.
PWBXjCgSaa	Dont put any ointment or anything on it! also do not take advice from wikipedia! anyone can write anything on that... It is going to take a couple days to heal. One thing you can do is stay hydrated and take aspirin, if the burn feels uncomfortable, rinse it with cool water, it will help the burning sensation! also, when your hair grows back, use a deep conditioner on it because of the damage caused to the cell.Hope this helps:)|`|l2lpOvfoaa	it would probably take 1-2 weeks. just DONT pick or touch the scab, it can cause infection and leave a scar.|`|MOhFynFTaa	ouch! :(    It will probably scab for a few days.. don't pick at it!

Also, something called Emu Oil works really. Don't ask me why, I have no clue, but it works wonders. Takes away most of the sting, and helps prevent scar tissue from forming.    I'll post a link to wikipedia, read it yourself
cyxbfPuEaa	depression? anemia? malnutrition? lack of sleep? are you overweight, possibly sleep apnea, do you snore? Here's a few of the more common things that would cause you to be fatigued all the time.  but start with the most simple solution. Take a multivitamin every Morning, and eat a good amount of red meat, greens or another food that high in iron.  Get at least 8 hours of sleep a night.  If you snore, try breathing strips, they might help.  If all that fails, it may be beneficial to see a psychiatrist, depression may be a problem.

AA10003191	The paramedic is wrong.    The reason they don't want to shock her heart is that she's likely been in AF and built up clots. Shocking (or chemically) converting such a patient is like asking for a stroke.    The ICD is designed to shock vfib, not afib. It would be rare for any device to be set to shock AF. If the device fires, it might kick a clot, but if it didn't fire, she wouldn't survive.    The problem with blood "thickeners" is that they directly counteract coumadin. It's virtually impossibly to perfectly reverse someone.    You need to sit down with her cardiologist, lay out your concerns, and get answers.    Good luck.|`|HQPvKObxaa	I'm not sure why they won't do an elective cardioversion for her Afib. The only contraindication that I know of for cardioversion due to Afib is if the tachycardia is either from poison or a drug OD. The reason they took her off the blood thinners is because if your gums are starting to bleed, then you risk internal bleeding in another part of the body, possibly the brain, which could cause a hemorrhagic stroke. The blood clots are caused because the blood is being churned up in her heart because her top chambers (atria) are almost quivering. I would definitely get a second opinion. You can have another cardiologist come and evaluate her in the hospital. If you do not feel comfortable with her leaving the hospital, then you need to say so. You can ask to speak to a patient representative or some type of family liaison to tell them your concerns.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Something doesn't add up here.  The risk of blood clots is life-threatening, but bleeding gums are just an annoyance - it doesn't make any sense that you would put someone's life at risk to avoid bleeding gums.       To sort this out, recognize that blood thinners do not actually make blood thinner - they reduce the ability of the blood to clot.  The very last thing you want when a person has atrial fibrillation is to have blood start to clot inside the heart, so the blood has to remain "thinned."  Under these circumstances, having blood that is too thin is exactly what you want to have - that means she doesn't need any medicine to prevent clotting.  What doesn't make any sense is why the docs would say on one hand that the blood is too thin, while at the same time saying that they can't apply electrical shocks due to blood clot risk.  These two conditions are mutually exclusive unless she has some type of blood disorder.     My advice is to ask the docs to explain this all to you again, and if you don't get a satisfactory answer, take her to a different cardiologist ASAP.|`|3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	Well, I am not an expert as far as the defibrillator. However, the matter of her coumadin level (blood test - PT), yes there is a way to make her blood "thick" that would be vitamin K. But, they will only use that if her PT results are extremely abnormal and I'm not sure that would be a wise idea because of the risk of blood clots. My mother was on chemo and it caused her coumadin to go completely off the charts. They gave her two units of fresh frozen plasma and within 24 hours her level was back in therapeutic range. Ultimately, I guess I really don't have any suggestions, none that would make more sense then what her cardiologist has already tried. You could always ask for a second opinion. Your wife is a lucky lady to have you (and I am sure you feel equally blessed). Take care.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I also suggest you ask for them to explain your wifes situation again as it doesnt really make sense. I am thinking you may have misunderstood some of the things happening and the reasons why.    If your wifes INR is too high she may get a bleed...usually for this to happen it would need to be way over the recommended range of around 2.5-3.5 possibly something closer to 8-10 for bleeding to occur and if it were that high they would treat it and get her back in-range.  If it is too low she is in danger of throwing a clot and having a stroke which is much worse.  You can replace blood but you cant replace  brain cells.
Iar0ngMXaa	depends on the individual and also depends on clinical factors such as how it looks under a micrscope, how much the cells resemble the normal tissue around it. a well differentiated cancer is typically less aggressive and slower growing, while a poorly differentiated cancer is typically more aggressive and faster growing. good news is if it is caught at stage 1 the chances for remission are good. I wont say cure because remission and cure are not the same things. you can go into remission and have absolutely no evidence of disease and then it can return.|`|8goEkQ49aa	if you have stage 1 ovarian cancer, you're very lucky (believe it or not).  It is rarely found at that stage, because there are usually no symptoms.    I do know that ovarian cancer grows relatively slowly, although of course, it varies per individual.    If you get treatment quickly, there may be no stage four.  There may not even be stage 2!  Usually stage one can be treated (Surgically, I believe).  There may be some medical follow-through, like chemo or radiation; I don't know.  But, again, stage one is the easiest to treat successfully.  Very good luck to you.|`|d2AzNKEFaa	THIS WOULD DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE TYPE OF CANCER CELLS THIS PERSON HAS AND HOW FAST IT GROWS|`|nsAGZtS7aa	Please read  what I posted on "Can I Refuse Cancer Treatment?"  The same information applies.  In fact most if not all of the health questions could be answered by visiting the sites that I mentioned. The idea is  what caused the cancer in the first place.  Dr. Neal Barnard mentioned one study, (only one if you can believe it), that they found that women who developed ovarian ca, had a higher intake of Yogurt.  That was only one study, and you need more studies, (no money).  Misho Kushi "The Cancer Prevention Diet," mentioned eating eggs as the problem.  So the idea of going from Stage 1 to Stage IV.  Well maybe if you don't feed the cancer it may stay at stage 1.    T. Colin Campbell, Phd,  Author of "The China Study," talks about the dangers of dairy.  Could check out:  zazzle.com/seapearls.  That's my source.I hope this helps
AA10198728	You're horny.  Masturbate or have sex more often and it'll happen less frequently.

Some women spot a tiny bit when they ovulate.(However, if your next period is late and there is a chance you might be pregnant, then buy a home test.)|`|DtaIFmNHaa	yea i had my period 4 4 weeks then got it the next day so ur just having ur period 2day

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	It appears that your doc was not very helpful on this matter.  Most of the time, these things eventually work their way to the surface of the skin, pop open, and drain, so it makes sense that a doc might dismiss this as unimportant.  However, if this thing has lasted nearly a year and is causing itching, it's not unimportant.   Sometimes the fluid dries up and forms a semi-permanent cyst - this appears to be your situation.    Once a hardened cysts forms, the only treatment is surgical removal or waiting years for it to go away.  Removal is pretty minor surgery that can be performed by  a dermatologist in the office.  You could make an appointment with a dermatologist to see what can be done.
RBQrgByeaa	I used to work out at night a lot. It's not as good. The caffeine has worn off -- my numbers on the machines proved I was weakening.    Instead of 30 minutes on one machine, try 15 minutes on two machines (or whatever proportion). That way you don't have time to weaken in one particular area.|`|MpTZjdLJaa	working out that late is a bad idea  reason is, your body needs to rest during your sleep  if you work your body hard  right before you go to sleep then you are forcing your body to work harder during your sleep and you don't get to the state of heavy sleeping as fast and it ends sooner. you should give your body about an hour (atleast) rest before you go to sleep.|`|OSkDgKcnaa	the gym wont help much if u dont have the energy etc as u describe. i suggest ditch the gym, and instead take ur kids for long stroller walks.  start small then extend the time. when the walks become easier, jog also. it would be great cardio, also, u can use the night to sleep like u need to. and when u get more sleep, u have more enery in the day for longer and better excersizes.    good luck|`|NNdkhCy0aa	So do I!  It's more convenient... yes I also have small children and a wife.  When they have all gone to bed I convert my lounge to a weight training gym.  This is what I do.  I try and grab a 15 minute doze sometime after 8pm, but no later than an hour before I exercise.  That resets my brain.  Then, half an hour before exercise, black coffee and a banana.  The banana releases its sugar at just the right moment for a hit halfway through my work out.  The effects of the caffeine late at night are worn off by the cortisol effects of the training.    PowerBars are expensive - I suggest two options if you want some protein.  Either have a bodybuilder's shake, or eat a small pot of cottage cheese.  Don't forget to have a small amount of carbohydrate immediately after your workout otherwise you will start to lose muscle mass as your body will use the proteins to recharge your flagging fuel levels.  Have the carbs, the insulin is released and it will stop muscle break down.  Your body will then use body fat instead at a much slower rate.    last thought.  Don't do any an-aerobic activity late at night.  The adrenalin level is too high at the end!  I would also suggest being careful of the contents in those chewy bars.  Often they contain sweeteners and other processed sugars which won't do your body any good.  The hormone levels it affects will slow down weight loss etc.. Try to stick to natural diets. That said, I don't know what is in a PowerBar, so it might be perfectly ok.  I personally avoid them.|`|qpLwBNkoaa	I workout quite late a lot too, i try and eat a snack about an hour before hand. Then sometimes before going have a choc bar 30mins before if tired. I always find making a mid day meal pasta or high in any carb food will store up the energy for you.  An iso energy drink will help you, i don't know about the bars, i had one once and could feel it while at the gym,eugh. Also if you're tired and hungry at the end, make sure you have some food,fruit or somthing on hand to get recovering, otherwise you're going to be knakkered in the morning! I always finish with a protein shake, but there are lots of general nutritional drinks to take there. I also found taking a multivitamin after work was good.
dByIPgJXaa	It sounds somewhat like a panic attack to me, If it was an absence seizure you wouldn't have been able to run to the bathroom I don't think. But still you should see a doctor about it.|`|jK9yiQq6aa	its called an absence seizure, like when you stare off into space without even knowing, you probabley had trouble remembering what happened, its harmless but you should see a doctor about controlling them|`|uRcx9llkaa	you were hyperventilating. sounds like u had anxiety/panic attack. the reason why u get this is because u r stressed.

pEaR7iuxaa	hi   found this hope it helps   http://www.tipking.co.uk/Health/Remedies...|`|djvmu3N9aa	I have found two quick remedies:  use a basic saline solution, such as Eye Wash from Safeway and keep rinsing your eye repeatedly for a while.  The other thing I've found that works great is to take a very clean wash cloth, moisten it with the Eye Wash solution, and with your finger inside the cloth, rub the wet cloth firmly across the rim of the eyelid where the stye blister is forming. I've found that this will break off the blister, removing the stye!  Then rinse your eye again a couple of times.

Wgf5Wrfjaa	you might want to try www.sparkteens.com you can key in your information and select that you want to maintain your weight and it should give you a general range to eat in. I know for me I am a 33 year old woman, 5'5, 148pounds trying to lose 18 pounds and I am to eat between 1200 to 1550 a day for losing weight and that is with a low activity level.

It is better to go and have nothing wrong than for it to be serious and not go.    Some women experience a brown discharge prior to their period.  Some women pass clots when they have their period.  A golf ball sized clot sounds painful to pass, but I'm guessing it was not solid. Lots of women experience headaches and cramping.      I would go to the doctor and see if you have a hormonal imbalance, this can cause changes in your periods and make them more uncomfortable.  Different hormonal supplements can be used to alleviate the symptoms, some doctors will prescribe birth control to help regulate your periods.    You don't pee out the clots, they come from two completely different holes.|`|1w9AXincaa	oh my god, your giving birth to alien babys.  lmfao, kidding. but clots are normal, just not golf ball sized ones.  you might wanna ask your mom about it ?|`|16b650b8bb336f97d89495b4f9933d3daa	1 - Irey H - it's not "pieces of your uterus"...or else we'd all be walking around with chunks out of our wombs.  The clots are coagulated "chunks" -for lack of a better word- of the endometrial tissue that our bodies accumulate every monthly cycle.    Now, for the question at hand...I'm not going to give a diagnosis because that's for a doctor to do...however...I do suffer from ovarian cysts that make ovulation painful, and then I have endometriosis (diagnosed by symptoms only...not a laparoscopy ...yet), which compunded with the cysts means heavy bleeding with "clots" anywhere from a marble to a small orange (lovely), constipation, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, constant pain in perineal area, and nausea and headaches, caused by the pain.  I have done everything from heating pads, and narcotic pain killers, to herbal remedies like red raspberry.  There are days that the pain gets so bad that I lay on my back with a heating pad in the back, heating pad on the belly and one between the legs. (believe me it works).  Also...take notice of your stress level...if you are finding yourself stressed, or even anxious about having your period, then it will be worse.  I find that the months that I'm not really looking forward to having it...the pain is more intense.    I know this is a lot of information to digest...but i do hope it helps you.  In the long run...many of our repoductive issues stem from hormone inbalance of some sort...so I suggest eating smart, exercising and keeping a positive attitude as well.
5yq9R52Eaa	It seems to me that your blood pressure is very good for a girl your age.  I am not sure what the parameters are for a 13 year old person, but most adults would like to have that kind of pressure!  Keep your weight at a normal range and get lots of exercise and you should be able to maintain a good blood pressure.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	very good blood pressure|`|L4kLAGRxaa	that is a great blood pressure i know that for sure sinci i am a heart and bypass patient|`|ByWRzuuraa	Its really good actually.

AA11404315	Oh fate sweetheart,          sounds like you have a classic case of a type of depression disorder, dont worry I think 80% of the world should be on something, actually thats been proven. Dont come here asking what you should do, have your mom take you to the docs and get evaluated. Do it girl! It wont happen overnight with time released meds but when the chemicals get balanced you will feel so focused and gain yourself back.|`|4tI5tE4Oaa	yeah it can be hard. just tell your mom that you would like to go to some therapy appointment. they either perscribe you the meds or they tell you ways you can cope with it. it can be hard. but it wi all be good.|`|whTnHQqfaa	i have been depressed for the last year and then this year, i have cut myself and blacked both of my eyes, my mom has noticed my depression and has started taking me to therapists they do the best they can but doesnt seem to help me feels like its only making things worse because i have to go talk to a stranger to talk about my problems...but thats diffrent i would just talk to my mom about it because she is noticing the depression in you also. i would try the anti depressants|`|f7GfjH91aa	Tell her everything you just put in this.   If you are worried about it, write her a note and explain   everything you are feeling. Leave it somewhere she will see it,   maybe on your way out of the house or something.   If you want to talk to her directly, do some reasearch   on anti-depressents so you can have an educated conversation.   She will know you are more serious if you know what you   are talking about.|`|lgSF2TH7aa	just tell her your not feeling well and you need to make a dr. appt. and then explain it to your dr. in privacy, the dr. coul;d then talk to your ma bout it, be careful tho , alot of the new anti-deppressant medicine can be more harmful than good for some one your age , they seem to make things worse.......|`|VnQymt4Raa	Doesn't necessarily sound like depression. I was diagnosed a year ago and at the time I constantly thought about killing myself. They told me I had a mild case. It sounds like you are just having a downer time. Try to stay away from depression medication though. For me it made me anorexic and then when I went off of it I gained 30 pounds in a month. It does weird things to your weight, sex drive, it can make you suicidal... try taking st. johns wart. It's a natural antidepressant. It takes about 6 weeks to fully work, but if you take that and get your mood up a little, then you will feel like exercising and that will get your mood up even more. If you start to desire dying though, get to your doctor!|`|AA11176856	by letting her know that you've been feeling like over a yr...n u want to get better by taking anti-depressants..hope that helps
KzYjmNkPaa	it's hard to speed up the processes but you can make it less visible with lotion and make up....it will probably take a week or less to become completely disappear and 80%(relative number) of all healing is done in the first 2 days..then the healing slows down for the most part. also keep it clean or it won't heal properly then it just takes forever to heal.|`|LLElLZnUaa	Depends on how this happened in the first place.

VkKS8nQuaa	I was told by my family physician two years ago that I was diabetic.  Not that I was going to be, could become... that I was.  I changed my diet habits, started exercising, avoided certain foods and ate healthier.     I had a physical this year... I asked about my diabetes and he said:  "You don't have it".    YES... you can do something about it in the early stages.  I did.|`|1u4wSz4raa	Yes the diabetes symptoms will go away and this is how you can do it.Very natural and effective method to stay healthy.  These pranayam exercises will help control the diabetes and the side effects.Build up the timing gradually.If you feel tired or dizzy, stop and resume later(after about a minute).The benefits will be noticed in weeks as the sugar level is checked daily.Over the long term the diabetes will be in full control and the medicine can be reduced in consultation with the doctor.    Kapalbhati -(Do it before eating) Push air forcefully out through the nose about once per second. Stomach will itself go in(contract in). The breathing in(through the nose) will happen automatically. Establish a rhythm and do for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day.  Children under 15 years  do 5 to 10 minutes twice a day.   Not for pregnant women. Seriously ill people do it gently.     Anulom Vilom    Close your right nostril with thumb and deep breath-in through left nostril   then  close left nostril with two fingers and breath-out through right nostril   then -keeping the left nostril closed deep breath-in through right nostril   then - close your right nostril with thumb and breath-out through left nostril.  This is one cycle of anulom vilom.  Repeat this cycle for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day.   Children under 15 years -  do 5 to 10 minutes twice a day.  You can do this before breakfast/lunch/dinner or before bedtime or in bed.Remember to take deep long breaths into the lungs.You can do this while sitting on floor or chair or lying in bed.     Also everyday, press the centre point of the palm of both your  hands 40 times with the thumb and press the tips of all fingers 40 times each.  Also do this: kneel down, breathe out,pull in stomach, keep your both hands on stomach, bend forward and try to touch the floor with your forehead.Do this 3 times to stimulate the kidney and pancreas.  Continue the exercises once a day, after the diabetes is in full control.

You can also go to a family planning center and get a test.

vSmop8Vhaa	Plan B will throw you out of wack for a couple days and even a month or two. Just go ahead and start taking your pills when you're suppose to. However, I remember taking Plan B, and starting the pills the next day (the plan B I took was only ONE pill instead of two).    You might not get your period until you finish your first pack of pill since you've taken Plan B.    The spotting is normal but don't believe it's your period.

RGvNRH8Iaa	It is normal to have weird periods for a while after you first start.  The only problem with this is that you could become anemic from bleeding heavily for so many days.  If it doesnt clear up within a couple months you may want to see a doctor.  They can put you on the pill to shorten your periods if necessary.|`|30iQkwJlaa	yes totally. sometimes my periods last 3 to 4 days and are very light. then the next time it will be soo heavy. but that is normal.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	yes it's normal. your period changes all the time depending on your stress level or how physically active you are. = )|`|9huxAcK9aa	Oh this sounds familiar  My period got super heavy like that when I became regular.

EQPE72hpaa	They should let you change the color every monthly appointment for tightening your braces.  What they do is they usually change the wire or add rings or add rubber bands. It all depends. They'll stop hurting maybe 1-3 days. But don't worry, they gradually hurt less and less with every tightening appointment. The pain only means that your teeth are moving! They hurt every time you change them... but to relieve it, you can take Tylenol, motrin, or advil... something along those lines. Those medicines will relieve it. But consult a guardian first before taking any medications, just to make sure!  Good luck(:|`|gVCZlEPIaa	Usually the colors change every other appointment in your choice.

I would gain a second opinion at the doctor, it is possible to have anxiety begin in this manner, I had a sudden on set of anxiety that began the same way confusion, low energy and tired, anxiety can act much like depression. If you return to the doctor and still are clear medically, ask them if anxiety may be an option, if you have journeyed threw neg. personal relations, stress at work school etc, anxiety can be a result, it is very important if these things are true to return to your medical doctor, this will head off future illnesses that stress can cause your body.    a second opinion is never a bad opinion,especially when you try the basics diet vitamins etc, and  do not see a change.    blessings to you     I would not panic with feeling like you have a disease, however their are cold virus going around the us that cause the same feelings, and hang on to the victim who gets it for close to a month.

But you can make them look bigger!    1. Choose tops that enhance your chest.  ((Get tees with high, asymmetrical necklines. If you have slender arms, sleeveless t-shirts will draw your attention to them and give the illusion of a larger bust. Stay away from deep v-necks or very low scoop-necks, although vees are better than scoops. Tighter fitting tops are better too. ))  2. Cross your bra straps.  ((In the back of your bra (behind, where it clasps) unhook the two straps and switch the little loophole they're fastened in. This will pull up your breasts, and make them look larger!))  3. Get a push-up or padded bra.     andd     When you have clipped your bra in place, bend forwards and shake your bra from the bottom, this fills the bra more, stand up straight and grab your breast and pull towards the other breast this gets more fat into the bra making them look bigger, tighten the straps until the cups have moved up your chest a good inch and pull your breasts towards each other again. This makes your boobs look perky and a lot larger.     andd    I do this when i wear a low cut top;  Use one shade darkers powder foundation and outline your boobs with them. Like ( and ). only turn the paraentethis to the right. Then take a shade lighter foundation (powder) and put it in the middle of the clev.|`|GJJbk023aa	You could gain weight, but maybe it's just best to love yourself as you are.

You look huge! Or get one of those gel bras or those gel inserts. I heard they are really good. Or you could get implants or that cream! Sorry, there's no natural way unless you gain weight. I would go with the other choices though because you'll never know where the weight will go! Just get a push up bra! That's what I did! Try victoria's secret or Macy's if you need something cheap!|`|0pIUYzfiaa	You can't "naturally" make your breasts grow.  Sorry to say, but that is kind of an immature question.  If your like 10-16 or whatever, get over it. They will grow eventually  everyones different. And I'm sick of telling my friends this because they do the same thing.

At a school gym, or real gym, there's something called at Peck Deck. Ask someone to watch you because if its not done properly, you can injure your spine badly. Anyways, do about 15 minutes on it. 3 sets of 12-16 reps. Once you can handle around 30 lbs, stick to it. After about three weeks, Your pecks ( which are the muscles under Your boobs) will grow, and push boobs outwards, making them look bigger.

K4zsztkRaa	It's impossible for just plain protien to make you fat. The only thing that uses protien is your muscle, if that's not using it up it will just go through your system. It won't turn to fat.     Why protien is great, it's great in the morning or RIGHT after you work out, like in the locker room after you work out.  You only need to drink it once maybe twice a day.  remamber you have to get one gram of protien per pound of muscle you have on your body per day. (not fat weight, pounds of muscle only)      -Connor
g01zjegEaa	You might've been misdiagnosed, but there are forms of autism that will disappear over time, but only for some people.

Not all.|`|jazKtgENaa	There's no cure|`|I83sYbARaa	Who are 'they',,   can you ask them?  Maybe you didnt have it?  Maybe whatever it was your body rebounded and healed itself...  Western medicine doesnt have a cure for a lot of things, they dont even know how people get autism, the cause... specualtion is strong that it is induced by vaccinations as children, but no one knows for sure, only the mothers say it is the vaccinations...  Was someone just being mean to say this to you?  Are you sure you had it?  research it more|`|AA11765949	Unfortunately there is no cure for autism, perhaps you were incorrectly diagnosed. Talk to your doctor about it. Glad you are ok now.|`|LwW1wacHaa	Well then it wasn't Autism or you had a person working with you that brought you into reality or you had a very light case of it. But no there is no cause. Try asking the person who told you you had autism like you parents or you doctor. Or  you were misdiagnosed.

The surgery will restore your ability to do basic things, which will allow you to take care of yourself, your child, and your puppy on your own.   Back pain can be debilitating. The compressed/pinched nerves causes painful muscle spasms which can be so tight and/or painful that you cannot move. The nerve pain in your leg(s) can be hard to deal with because it is a painful, burning sensation. Its definately not pleasant, and the surgery will help lessen these symptoms, or even better, cause them to go away all together.  I have recently been recently diagnosed with spondylolisthesis (L5/S1), which is caused by one vertabrae slipping over another. I am not needing surgery at this time, but I am currently scheduled to get a second epidural steroid injection to help with the spasms, pain, and nerve pain/numbness in my right leg. I HATE needles (as in terrified, total basket case..lol), but if this helps me, than I'm all for it! I like the minimal down time, which is a only day or two.  In your case surgery is much more invasive, and the more you wait, the worse your condition could get. This surgery could require extensive recovery time, rehabilitation (physical therapy), but you could get your life back. No one has time to be down like this, as many of us have a more physical job that requires standing, walking, lifting, ect.   Unfortunatly we adults have bills to pay, and its extremely difficult to have to take time away from work/life to recover. Check if disability insurance (sometimes it is paid 100% by the employer, other times you have to enroll and pay a small premium) is available at work. This will allow you receive a portion, and in some cases, all, of your current salary to help pay the bills while you are out. The Family Medical Leave Act allows you to take time off for things like this and still retain your current salary when you return. This prohibits employers from firing you for taking time off for medical problems/treatments. You may have paperwork to fill out, so get started right away. You might be able to look into Social Security Disability Insurance. If you revieve both types of disability pay, payments from both may be reduced. You can apply for food stamps, or you could call your local food bank for assistance with your grocery bill.  As for child care, talk to your trusted neighbors and family members. Look into programs for disabled/injured people to help with costs if needed. After a procedure or surgery requiring some downtime, my parents have always come in to help. The United Way is a good charity to look to for assistance. Here is a website, enter your city and zip code: http://www.liveunited.org/myuw/ .  Back pain like this can be disabling, and depressing. It affects your ability to do simple tasks, such as doing laundry or putting dishes into the dishwasher. Waiting too long could cause your condition to worsen. I wish the best for you, and schedule your surgery as soon as you can.|`|JODVNkU8aa	Hi  Have you tried a osteopath, I have been seeing one privately while waiting for an op as the pain has got so bad that I just could not function a normal day to day life.  The doctors gave me 3 different types of painkillers to take together and all that did was dull the pain and made me feel like I was in another world. I now only take one painkiller and just keep the others if the pain gets really bad.  Wish you all the best|`|X4NIyjUkaa	ask the one u love to take care of your child and your dog.i have it but it just started today so i can only say take back pain pills and then when u go to the hospital then bring the pills to the hospital so the doctor can see them.|`|Q0v41NA1aa	I would recommend a Chiropractor.  He/she will manipulate your spine to get it into place and you only lose the time it takes to get there and return,plus about one or two hours for the treatment.  You will be able to return to nomal life immediately and no medications.
974f0b5b6385aa54a25619cd68541a47aa	Tablets only take the feeling of the pain away temporarily.  Do some stretching like Yoga, that also helps to strengthen your back and loosen you up at the same time, there's some moves that specifically focus on the back, you'll feel good for it!    Try a few sessions of chiropactic - I've tried osteopathy, acupuncture, sports therapy, everything,, and find chiropratic the best for improving the back pain, a bit expensive, but well worth it.    Also, I believe that a good diet also affects the pain, so look into eating more veg, fish, iron, protein, all that stuff.    Cold ice packs are very good for relieving back pain, not heat packs.    Hope you feel better soon!|`|shiiRrcoaa	The treatment depends on the cause of your back pain.      For example, if you have a herniated or degenerated disc, you need immediate medical attention...possibly surgery.  If you have a pinched nerve you may need injections and physical therapy.  If you have a pulled muscle you may need heat and relaxation.  If your back pain is due to being overweight, you might need to lose weight and in the meantime do strengthening and stretching exercises.  If you are pregnant, the stress can be relieved through how you sit and position your back while pregnant as well as massage.    So you see.. more info is needed to provide you with the best direction to go in.  But know that back pain can be dealt with if the origination of it is understood.|`|8NqQvOqQaa	nevermind tablets  try heatpads   ;)|`|dP37ygplaa	I wood see your dr first but also try ling on the floor 4 a bit but it may not work 4 you as it dose for me but I wood see my gp first|`|X4NIyjUkaa	i have the same pain and it moved from my shoulder bone to my middle back,i don't know of your answer but i say it is either your bed or your bones are weak.mine is my bed and my room so technically it is me not sleeping well.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	Heat applied to the affected area will provide some relief. You may take acetaminophen, aspirin,, ibuprofen, or naproxen as long as you feel significant pain.    The person should sleep, pillowless, in one of the following arrangement: on a very firm mattress, with a bed board under the mattress, on a waterbed, or even on the floor.  A folder towel beneath the low back and a pillow under the knees may increase comfort. And good luck.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	if u find out please do tell me|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	The only thing that has ever really worked for me are steroid injections but they wear off and you can't have them repeatedly.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	for me, an ice pack applied on the bad spot for 45min, paracetomol, later, use a heat pack to loosen it up a bit    and rest up a couple days, just like anything else that hurts, go easy

DKnBzCUpaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.      Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|iZk9jEBpaa	No thanks i'd rather let nature take it's course.|`|rkePX77Xaa	Does it matter how old you are?
00EknjYOaa	I think 30 grams should be enough im 6'2 190 and i consume no more than 40 grams of protein after a workout, and if you want to gain muscle be sure you are eating more calories than you need to maintain so lets say you need 2600 calories daily to maintain you would want to eat about 200 to 500 more to build more muscle just don't eat too much fat and try to eat good carbs like vegetables whole grains etc., also you should try to consume 20 to 25% of total calories in protein and another 25% of fat and the rest of carbs, and remember to rest your muscles or else they wont grow as fast|`|OiNfQzRaaa	Protein is an essential part to your diet and workout routine. Your daily protein intake should be about 1 gram of protein per pound you weight. But also make sure that you consume carbs after working out, because it is really important to restore energy to your body, and if you don't eat enough carbs your body will attack your muscles for energy instead.      You can also take the route of weight gainers to aid in your muscle and weight growth.    Do some research on proper dieting for muscle growth, it is really easy to find good information and very very interesting.
DVryUlrSaa	if you can feel it in your eye,  you may have contact inside out.    check it by taking it out,  and putting it on your finger like you're about to put it in.  here's a picture of what it should and shouldn't look like.    http://i2.allaboutvision.com/i/right_vs_...        if it's not inside out,  you could have torn the edge, or have something in your eye.|`|hAB7m8otaa	it could be inside out or there may be something in your eye.  if your contacts start to bother or hurt your eyes, take them out.|`|1KbOWbcsaa	it might be inside out. take it out and flip it inside out and out it back in. see if that helps.|`|fazWgkePaa	It may take a day or so to get used to, but if it still bothers you in a day or so go back to your eye doc...maybe he gave you the wrong size.|`|32f9cc5fba26f1df236e4cf01ec98d8eaa	If you can feel the contact it's probably because it is dry and you just need some re-wetting drops.  You can use the solution that you store your contacts in for this also.  Good Luck|`|1TradJBIaa	well it may just be your eyes getting used to having contacts in them! But you could try taking out the one that is bothering you, and rinsing it off with solution.  OR it could possibly be in backwards. If you take it out and hold it on your fingertip and look at it eye level, it should look like a perfect bowl. If the "bowl" looks like the rim is curled under/outward then it is most likely just in backwards, flip it the right way, rinse off and put it back in.  :] hope i helped|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	You should not put your contact lens solution directly in your eye. It's not going to hurt anything but it won't help you as much as a re-wetting drop would if dryness really is your problem.    Take your lens out, rinse it well. Check to make sure it's not inside out, inspect it closely for any tears, divits, rips, etc...even the smallest defect in your lens can be incredibly uncomfortable once it's on your eye.    You will get used to them and will not be able to feel them after awhile, but if you JUST got them, there will be an acclemation period, usually a week or so...it's all new to your eye so you may be aware of them this week, but they should not ever be painful.    If it persists, call your eye doc back in a day. It could be that the lens in defective. It doesn't usually happen but it is not impossible. They can give you a new one if you are still wearing a trial pair. Otherwise, she may tell you to take a new one from your supply that you bought and see if that solves the problem. If not, it could be your eye. Some people have misshapen corneas and it makes contact lens wearing uncomfortable or impossible.    Good luck!
DXJ6Ws8oaa	it's not too bad. it depends on the person you are sucking up too. In life sometimes you WILL have to suck up to some people but you should try to avoid it at all cost even if it means seeming like an @sshole.

QEPC7nveaa	Join this site and add me (kissme) as a friend:  http://www.livinganxious.com/    It's like myspace (with a photo gallery, polls, an arcade filled with games, forums, blogs, profiles...etc.), but for social anxious people. You can write blogs about your daily social anxiety (or random other things you're going through) and people will respond to you and try to help you. In fact, if you ask 'what can I do about my social anxiety' in a blog you'll get many helpful answers most likely! You can also learn from other people's experiences. Some blog about doctors who they go to specifically for their SA (social anxiety) some talk about groups they've gone to or are planning on going to. I'm 17 and I have an account, but there's a variety of different age groups. People in their teens, people in their 20's and even people in their 50's and older! Some have SA so bad that they can't leave their house and some you doubt they actually have SA because they can hide it so well. I know it probably sounds like I'm promoting this website, but check it out and you'll see why! :P    Long answer short: To get over your SA it's best to learn from others experiences and have other people helping you rather than doing it alone. Good luck and I hope to see you on the site soon!    Also, check out this link:   http://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-a-Social...    It's from wikihow, but the tips are great.    Oh, I should also mention that to overcome social anxiety you really have to change your way of thinking and embrace yourself the way you are. Many people have SA because they're worried about what people will think about them in social situations. They're worried they'll say or do something stupid and they'll embarrass themselves.|`|gupPAwvqaa	well i would say that its normal and your not the only one...i was the same at your age..and guess what i've managed to overcome it but not completely...its something that every human experiences only some more than others...check out this website..itt will give you information on the anxiety..but i think that the way to help make it less of a problem to you is by just making friends...having someone to talk to...once you start that...you begin gaining confidence..and little by little will go away...if you need to talk...im here....|`|TRuV4OS1aa	ok wat you should do is go with some people for a beer cause you can drink at your age in england right  well alcohol is a social lubricant and i helps you to lose you inhibitions and feel more comfortable around other people
96RDuDofaa	Try taking Midol--it works really well for menstrual fatigue and other "monthly issues". Also, I highly recommend Red Bull;; it tastes great and keeps you energized and focused all day long  xD
qdw3ZOYFaa	Do you have other symptoms aside from what you think is temperature? For example..have you a sore throat..throbbing headache..sniffles....watery eyes..etc Are you tired. And do you have aches and pains.... or you are out of breath? If not you may have a viral infection. I prefer you to  take paracetemol instead of Advils (does this contain ibuprofen,,,which is bad for your stomach).....2 every 4 hours but do not exceed 8 in 24 hours. Do not take any 'cold medications' with this as you may be overdosing If your temperature does not improve in 4 to 5  days...or you start develeping the above symptoms during the 4 to 5 days..or after..seek medical assistance as you may have a bacterial infection which needs antibiotics|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	yes it can be a flu.  It may be a flu you were not vaccinated against.|`|t1lzvI0iaa	the flu shot helps in some cases. But basically all it does is put a little bit of a dead flu virus into you so that your body learns to become immune to it. But this doesn't always work sometimes it just makes you sick. If you do not get any better soon you should probally call or see a doctor.|`|LvLINOu1aa	Its just a fever.    Flu shot doesnt protect you from the flu 100%.    Take Tylenol Severe.  Its almost triple the size of a regular tylenol.   It works for me everytime.|`|I2tsgufaaa	I had the same problem and my temp was 105! This also happened after i got the flu shot. I went to the doctor and of course it was just a bad case of the flu. Just take it very easy, it took me a week to get over mine.   Please drink plenty of fluids, i hope you feel better.|`|3djzVF4uaa	My friend was feeling the same way last week. I told her to take some Theraflu. I usually drink the drink mix kind. Drink some gatorade too. These always make me feel better. Especialy Theraflu. Drink it while its hot. Well..not TOO hot.
F08HDRvraa	All types of cows milk (even powdered milk) has sugar in it naturally - lactose.  If she decides to switch to soy milk - be sure and check the label to make sure sugar has not been added.  Even though it has sugar, milk is a good source of protein and calcium, so your mom should be able to have it in controlled amounts, so she should be able to have her milk and coffee.  Or she can try to find a sugar free non dairy creamer.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,    She should try Almond Milk and Soy based milk, and see if they will help.    How high is her sugar level?    Things that are not so good for any diabetic are cheese, caffeine, and animal fats.  It would be better if she gave up coffee, but I understand that it is difficult to give up.    Just about everything that you eat will turn into blood sugars once it reaches the small intestines.  This is what foods do, and it is how everyone survives.  Just that milk and the processed sugars in the coffee turn into higher levels of sugar than the body requires, so the body will normally produce insulin, ,and turn the excess sugar levels into body fat cells.    When more sugar is needed than the body has in the bloodstream, then the liver makes a hormone that causes some of the fat cells to release sugars back into the bloodstream.    She can reduce the sugar levels naturally by eating less meats, cheese, and also by eating much smaller meals, say 5-6 times a day.  Then each blood sugar spike will only be a small amount, because of the small amount of food consumed with each meal.    Before the sugars are all burned by the body muscles, there will be another meal on the way, to provide more sugars.    Good Luck!|`|5iOHJHUzaa	unsweetened soy milk.|`|8asG4WCwaa	She can switch to a no sugar added powdered milk coffee creamer (Coffemate makes it, I believe).  Or, there are brands of real milk that have reduced sugar content (in Texas, HEB stores carry MooTopia, but there are others on the market).

I bet you are though!|`|jZHzgfGHaa	A healthy diet and some exercise can help. Do be sure you stop buying junk food for the whole house and change the eating habit of the family instead of just for your daughter.  124 pounds is very light so she probably just needs a bit of toning to get happy with her mid section .Walking, swimming, biking, using a stability ball can all help. Most importantly, she should feel good about her self image and 124 pounds doesn't sound like it's too high.|`|8xSlwrLoaa	Seriously? What an awful thing to ask about your daughter.|`|sGQprLf8aa	Where's the problem?!? That is a perfectly normal weight for her height! Are you stressing about this more than she is? Or is she stressing about it? At that age I think all girls feel like that. According to the BMI Calculator your daughter is only at 22! That is EXCELLENT!!! A normal BMI is between 18 and 25. And one isnt considered overweight until they hit the 30 mark. You daughter is fine! EVERYONE has fat on their body. And belly fat is particularly common among nearly ever female. In my opinion your daughter is fine! But if this is really bothering her (in a healthy, non-eating disorder kind of way), then all she needs to do is eat right and exercise 30 minutes a day. DO NOT obsess over this. She's fine!!!
n6KzVBc7aa	colors are generally more noticeable. avoid getting white anything, because it makes your teeth look yellow. A lot of girls get pink, I got blue almost every time because I thought it was really pretty. Remember, you can change the colors every time you go back, so if you decide you don't like whatever you pick, no big deal! :)    good luck, I'm sure you'll be just fine.
2SgsPKF9aa	You don't say how old you are but it doesn't matter. You are in a high stress situation and your brain is trying to cope by shutting down. Everyone handles things differently. I agree that you need some help. Maybe for a short time some anti-anxiey meds and some therapy. Then learn ways to handle the stress better. I have been in your shoes with an enormous amount of stress and started just sitting in the chair and staring at the tv and then staying in bed and wanting to sleep until I felt better. But I finally admitted myself to a hospital for therapy and am very glad I did.|`|LFwQPrxbaa	What lame-a$$ doctor told you that you're OK?!?!  It sounds like you are really carrying a huge burden and dimissing you and saying it's "just stress" is like saying a tornado is "just a bit of wind"....    I don't have any good advice because I don't know your situation, but I just wanted to post a few words of encouragement.  Try to find a dr who understands that you need some help (whether an Rx or some kind of outside, part time family aid) and ask if/how you can what you need to help your brother and mother through this situation without YOU losing your mind.    Good Luck!

9NpXU7D2aa	it would scatch the lenses and ruin them. and there is a chance that not all the paste will come off then you get it in your eye and it irritates it.   if your sister in law swears by it ok what ever but if i was you i wouldn't try it yourself.|`|a855134c17cde877bc9f379821785833aa	You should not use anything except water and contact lens cleaning solution on your contacts. Baking soda is gritty, so it may create small scratches on the lenses, which can make them less transparent. In addition, some of the baking soda will stay on the lens, and it can get in your eyes which can cause major problems because it is basic/alkaline. Lastly, you should not try to extend the life of your contacts, because the more you wear them, the more bacteria and protein collects on them.|`|IQXnS893aa	don't do that it will ruin your contacts|`|C5aYxbAjaa	I am not sure where she got the idea from, but only clean contact lenses with the recommended cleaning solution.  Contact lenses will last a predefined length of time depending on what type it is, cleaning it with certain solution wont help prolonging its life.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	Why would you use a blowdryer?!!  I just don't understand this concept at all.  If you have an earache, it's because you have an infection.  OTC drops won't take care of this.  You need to see a physician and get antibiotics.  It won't go away by itself if it's infection.|`|1b3ab1f5bfb9839f6af7c79693195feeaa	My girlfriend does not believe me when I tell her to do this, but it works. Stomp on your foot.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	Now, see your health care provider as soon as possible. If is does become necessary to remove it (ear wax), use drops such as carbamide peroxide (Debrox Drops, E.R.O. Drops), or try the following home recipe: Mix half a teaspoon of baking soda in 2 ounces of warm water and pour into a dropper bottle. Use a few drops twice a day for up to a wee, and discard any leftover solution. ( Don't use ear drops if you have a perforated eardrum or are prone to ear infections.) And good luck.
MpTZjdLJaa	900 calories eh  that means all veggies, nothing else and a lot of water  kinda boring eh  a 900 calorie diet is not a good idea  i would say 1700-2000 calories for you  a low calorie lunch is a bag o broccoli (raw becuase thats the best way to have it), a sandwich, whole wheat bread, ham, mustard, and lettuce and a bottle of water.|`|90cyv9f0aa	don't forget   1 EAT BREAKFAST WHICH IS HIGH IN CARBOHYDRATES    2 ELIMINATE SWEETS COMPLETELY- INCLUDING ANY DRINKS WITH SUGAR- DRINK DIET SODAS IF YOU MUST!   3 NEVER- NEVER EAT AFTER 6 p.m    prove to yourself after 30 days how quickly you lost weight and how little you suffered...|`|I24AuawZaa	DO NOT EAT LESS  Now we have that out the way.     If you're wanting to change what you're eating, substitute things like fruit instead of chocolate.   And make sure you have a decent Breakfast everyday is one of the best things you can do.     Working out is also helpful.   How about going for a jog every morning or something?  You need to get your heart rate working at least 3 times a week, at 20 minutes each time.|`|haAtwu3iaa	Drink lots of water.    Try intervals.  One of my girlfriends has this walking/running routine:    walk - 10 minutes  run - 3minutes.  repeat 3x    THAT'S OVER 30 MINUTES OF EXERCISE!  and since you want to lose weight "fast"  I would consider doing this 4 times a week.    maintain a healthy diet, cut out the fast food, processed sugar/candy&sweets, dairy (try almond, rice, or soy milk), and meat will put the pounds on you to (try fish instead of beef, chicken, ham, or turkey, you can also try mock meat that's what I eat).      - hope this helped!|`|A1i7l7KCaa	1 get on a more healthy diet and work out more!NEVER EAT LESS but eat till your tummy say "im full!!" lol   do you have a work out system in you basement if not do you have "on demand" on you tv??? well they have free work out videos   and there really fun i've done them with my friends... but you have hope be strong!!!!!

dDVKReVJaa	Okay, I'm a mother to two teenaged girls, and I'm telling you, it doesn't stop when you get older. I still do it, too!  And then you fall into the cycle, where you get angry because you're crying and you feel like a dork, which makes  you even madder, which makes you cry more, which makes you madder............  You get the picture.  Just learn to control the aggression, and once you get over the hormonal hump that comes with being a teenager, it'll get a little easier to deal with.  Until you get pregnant. Then WOAH!!!!!!! You'll find yourself crying at everything!  Isn't it great being female??|`|Wt81sGW5aa	that's normal i know a lot of people who do that|`|WdHyIUVhaa	Your different reaction when you are mad is not weird.  The weird thing is that event that cause the madness.  You could learn something of you of that.    Take care!|`|I83sYbARaa	This could be several things....   it could be just emotions you could deal with better, pent up anger, you could deal with , or an actual neurological problem., hormonal, or other.any of which could cause you to have a little trouble breathing when you feel this way.  .To have a complete workup and answer you would have to have a complete work up by people trained in this area, and it would be expensive without insurance, you could check with your parents and see if their insurance could cover it and look up the PNP center in Dallas, Texas by Dr. Lawlis....... did you see Dr. Phil lately where the lady had the same problem since she was your age?  Go to his site and read, also about it... it was just monday, i think...  That is one perspective....  Another thing that might help is if you know anyone you could trust to talk to about it, like a trained counselor, or someone... or even your parents, or trusted family member...  There is a site at www.emofree.com that gives a free technique for dealing with any emotion and removing the harmful effects safely and it is easy to learn and apply...... read there...... learn and apply and see if it works.... you can also download the free manual on the technique if you want to....... try it.....   this is exceptional advice for you to try....  You can heal this, and the tears are normal for many people who get angry....  because under the anger is fear, and sometimes hurt... the real feelings the anger masks, or is expressed so that one isnt so vulnerable....  There are counselors at the site I gave also, If you want them....|`|a0Wf8RXBaa	no its not weird, its an expression of your emotions, its a problem if you become violent. try counting from 1 to 10 slowly with deep breaths,  if that doesn't work punch your pillow to get your anger out, it will let tension out. also try and talk to someone about why you get angry, you may feel better. a problem shared is a problem halve.|`|goksyck9aa	I don't think so.

icgTII3Maa	I wouldn't take an extra 3.75mg pill if I were you. It would be better if you let your doctor know that the dose he gave is not working and it may be increased to 5mg first, then up to 7.5mg, whatever he finds suitable for you.
yNMc5g7paa	It doesnt cause ulcers, but if you already have a defect in your stomach, it could potentially lead to ulcers.    The reason is that you are chewing, making your brain believe that you are eating, sending a signal down to your gut to send acid to your stomach.    If there is nothing for the acid to "eat", it will just attack your stomach lining, causing an ulcer.    This does not always happen, and could only be a problem if you already have a defect with your stomach.    Gum shouldnt be a cause for ulcers though, its usually something else that does it.|`|gupPAwvqaa	i dont think so..havent heard that..|`|VgE6HSdtaa	lol. i hope not. i love gum|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	no herpes does|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	wherever you heard that was a bad source. i chew packs of gum a day and ive never had any problems.|`|Cmj2S5S4aa	it can cause stomach ulsurs              and  it makes you memory slightly worse (we did an experiment in school)  :P|`|SSnCjOsbaa	ive never heard that before
eOUQ07mJaa	look at the link for a video of how to roll on a condom  try not to pierce the condom with your finger nails and don't try to put it on like you are trying to smother something.  Just roll it on.  It should be pretty quick.    Generally, even a bigger condom will fit just that it will have some extra room.  Try out different ones to see.  From closer ones to regular to larger.|`|6lmFyr2maa	ok well just put the condom on the end of your penis and roll it down. Just make sure you leave a little of condom spare at the end. Pinch the litte bit of condom at the top of the penis to get the air out. This will provide space for the *** to go instead of shooting up the sides and out the top.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Juts but normal condoms as they fit most guys . Unless of course you are very long or thick   It is best you buy a couple of differing types and try them out on your own to make sure you understand how to put one on   Each pack contains instructions including diagrams , but basically as soon as you are erect you remove the condom from the foil , holding the end between two fingers  , with the other hand just roll it back over the full length of your penis   As for your friend getting his girl to put it on , lots of guys do this as it can be quite exciting . Maybe they had an issue at one time and she was able to satisfy herself that it was on properly and has continued to do it . So go out and buy some now to try them out , but do not dispose of any used one down the loo as they have a habit of floating straight back after you flush !!!  and your mum might find it|`|ZZJLiG3Xaa	WELL FIRST HOW BIG ARE YOU AND TBOT THAT YOU THINK WILL FIT YOU AND THEN READ THE DIRECTIONS DAHHHHEND GET A|`|EcVixpwBaa	take a ruler to it and tell the guy who sells condoms what size to get then have your mate put it on 4 u|`|HBvsCZmLaa	just go buy some "regular" sized condoms from the supermarket. they have insturctions inside on how to put them on.. usally just get hard and then hold the tip of the condom and then hold the base of your penis and then roll the condom over the top until it reachs the base.. it should be firm fitting and not loose. you dont want it comming off during sex.

RGvNRH8Iaa	I believe proper nutrition absolutely does affect fertility.  If your body is deficient in nutrients it will sometimes turn off functions that are not necessary for its own survival, such as reproduction.  Obviously, that doesnt happen to most people even if they are deficient, or we would   have a lot less babies around!  But for some women who struggle with infertility, good nutrition can make conception possible for them.    I just read an article about this earlier today!  It was on naturalnews.com--it was saying that infertility treatments/drugs have been linked with cancer and that those who have trouble conceiving should turn to nutrition instead.
fFqzD3aMaa	Use the fast pneumonic    Facial weakness  Arm weakness  Speech difficulties  Time to call 911    It wasn't a stroke|`|HQPvKObxaa	Many people have what are called TIAs or transient ischemic attacks. They can be precursors to strokes and often present the same as your symptoms. Many people overlook them because they feel okay afterwards, which usually causes them to not go to the hospital when they actually have a stroke because they think it will go away. Dizziness and blurred vision would be more than enough to send me to the ER.

VBMOuIuxaa	you need to see the doctor. just for your own knowledge. there is NO shame in seeing the doctor about your sexual health. believe it or not, an untreated STD infection can cause infertility in women. please go get checked. on a slightly less scary note, usually the most common infection from oral to genital contact is Candida albicans (aka YEAST). which is an easy fix. promise. good luck, hope i helped
wdmp9eYXaa	most definitely. you need to talk with your parents if you are under 18 and then set up an appointment to go and see your regular doctor and for a check up . while there explain to him/her what you have been experiencing and follow any directions that you are given. you might be directed to see a psychiatrist to be put on medicine for depression with follow ups to make sure that the medicine is working okay and that you are doing okay on it. i have been in your shoes and depression can have an effect on every part of your life if left untreated.|`|goksyck9aa	Uh, yeah?

I think for your height the calories are good if you work out as you say but I'm around your height and eat fewer calories (my metabolism is really slow...I aim for 1100 at the most)    I would look into a cleanser of some sort or beginning with a toxin removal diet (you don't eat any sugar, dairy, meat, alcohol) for 21 days to clear your body of toxins that might make it difficult to lose weight. it's hard but the results are amazing!    Some other tips to consider:    1. cardio for 25-30 min three times a week    2. yoga or pilates three times a week on days you're "resting"    3. interval training and muscle confusion workouts    4. eating greens     5. protein over carbs any day    Don't eat after 9 and cut out all soda and alcohol.

Nobody should feel this way, it's very stressful to deal with especially at such a young and vulnerable age. Firstly, having a father who doesn't care does make you feel alone and sad but you did nothing wrong. He made the choice to ignore you for all of those years he wasn't there and it's your choice on whether or not you want to see him. Of course, I think it'll do you good to get your feelings out in the open to him. If you keep quiet he might think he can walk in and out of your life whenever it's appropriate to him so if you make it clear now that he needs to clean his act up or that's it then at least he knows where he stands. What you need to do is live for yourself and those who love you - ok, so your best friend changed and your Father has caused multiple amounts of stress for you but your Mother loves you deeply and you need to get help for her if not yourself. It must be hard telling her about these feelings but I'm sure she must have noticed you looking a bit down unless you're good at hiding it. If you're scared of hurting her feelings then don't be - she'll be more grateful if anything that you were able to confide in her and trust her. Don't feel like this is a burden for her either, because your life in her eyes is way too precious. This depression thing is obviously becoming a problem at school also because of your grades so I would suggest you see a counselor. This will allow you to talk about things and get help when you need it - it'll really give you a motivation boost. It will also do you good to talk to someone especially as you feel you can't open up to your friends. A symptom of depression is loss of interest in activities you'd normally partake in which describes why you don't want to do the swimming anymore. Listen, I know it's hard but you do need some professional help here. It's too much to deal with on your own. As for the anger, it's all because you're bottling these hidden feelings up.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Single blood pressure readings should never be considered diagnostic. You'll ideally need to have 24 hour BP monitoring to get a more accurate reading. Being hypertensive in pregnancy puts you at an increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia later on in pregnancy, so you will require monitoring.     There is nothing you can really do at this juncture to lower your blood pressure yourself-  try and reduce sodium in your diet and eat healthily. Also try and exercise where possible. If your average reading is high, then you will require hypertension lowering drug therapy.    Your blood pressure may have been high prior to the pregnancy- do you have any other recent readings? Sometimes it's just one of those things that happens. Try not to worry too much.    Edit  140 isn't really indicative for drug therapy at this stage. They will monitor you throughout your pregnancy and if there is a change they will provide treatment accordingly.|`|5yq9R52Eaa	You don't mention your age or weight, or whether you have additional health problems.  Generally, if you don't normally have high blood pressure you could try to lose weight if you are overweight, increase your activities, walking, etc. and avoid fatty and salty foods.  If you are also having swelling in your feet and ankles you are probably retaining water, which will also make your blood pressure higher.  Drinks lots of water also.  Frequently women will have high blood pressure later in the pregnancy and it is a serious concern.  You need to do all you can to get it back to normal.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Only a very small percentage of persons with high blood pressure are salt sensitive and would possibly benefit from reducing sodium intake. You need to make sure that you maintain a proper amount of sodium in your body when you are pregnant. The amniotic fluid should be as salty as the ocean is.    140/90 is high but not excessively so. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure, usually greater than 140/90.

tRkIfBOyaa	You unfortunately can't prevent them but I have taken Lysine on a daily basis.  It's an over the counter amino acid that has helped me and my family members from getting them so frequently.  When I get cold sores (which I have way to many to count them) I also use rubbing alcohol to help keep it dried out.  I also will take Ibuprofen to help with the fever in it and use ice on it too.  I don't use very many moisturizers when i have a cold sore since that will keep it moist and not heel as quickly.  But when it gets to that point where it's starting to crack a little i keep a little carmex or neosporin on it to help that.  Good luck!|`|b2686104ef2480397eb802150472c27aaa	You cant prevent them.

I really like the carmex chapstick though...it helps with them too and you can use it as regular chapstick!       Hope that helps!

Brilliant website for sport especially! Another reason stomachs may not appear flat is due to excess fat on the body which can only be got rid of by dieting or cardiovascular exercise. Bloating may also cause a less than flat stomach and carbonated drinks may cause this. An increase in the fibre of your diet should help this
IgNADy1Taa	- Wear different clothes while smoking (i.e. if you're wearing a sweater outside that covers all your clothes, stash it away before you come into class...it should offer some protection to your clothes underneath)    - Use Febreeze or another odour-remover on your clothes and hair...Febreeze and similar products actually remove odour rather than mask it    - You could try using deoderant/cologne to mask the smell, but a) it might not work as well as the above and b) it's always suspicious when kids smell too good    - If you don't mind people knowing you smoke regular cigarettes, I find the smell of normal smoke/tobacco pretty much dominates any other smell in the room    - Make sure you don't have any leftover weed on you/near you, especially half-smoked joints or crushed buds in a bag which really reek    - Smoke in an open space, preferably outside where it's windy, and not cooped up indoors somewhere|`|7XqQTkUuaa	Not surprisingly, marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions, impaired coordination, difficulty in thinking and problem solving, and problems with learning and memory. Research has shown that marijuanas adverse impact on learning and memory can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off.2 As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a suboptimal intellectual level all of the time.    Effects on the Heart  One study found that an abusers risk of heart attack more than quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana.7 The researchers suggest that such an outcome might occur from marijuanas effects on blood pressure and heart rate (it increases both) and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.    Effects on the Lungs  Numerous studies have shown marijuana smoke to contain carcinogens and to be an irritant to the lungs. In fact, marijuana smoke contains 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than tobacco smoke. Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which further increases the lungs exposure to carcinogenic smoke. Marijuana smokers show dysregulated growth of epithelial cells in their lung tissue, which could lead to cancer;8 however, a recent case-controlled study found no positive associations between marijuana use and lung, upper respiratory, or upper digestive tract cancers.9 Thus, the link between marijuana smoking and these cancers remains unsubstantiated at this time.    Why would you risk your health this way?  My mom smoked weed for years, and now she can't even remember my name.|`|PVe6jK78aa	I have a classic and simple solution. Take a toilet paper roll or paper towel roll and fill with dryer sheets. You exhale into the roll slowly and if you do it right the smoke doesn't even come out of the roll. Be sure to keep your mouth up to the roll and inhale through your nose and out through your mouth a few times. The best part is that when you use febreeze, axe, cologne, etc. it doesn't full cover up the smell it just mixes not to mention you'll look mad sketchy but with this the smell is never there to begin with and the dryer sheet smell only lasts like 10min then it smells like your room again.      P.S. Do NOT use a joint or blunt because the smoke from the joint will fill the room.

6gapssLfaa	Yea... I think your a little to young, and I'm pretty sure the Maine doesn't have a very reputable medicinal marijuana program going on over there. And just because you have "chronic depression, and severe anxiety" doesn't mean you should smoke weed just to get high legally. There are plenty of other medicines that you could take that would do a lot better of a job. Plus medicinal marijuana isn't federal under any state so your just trying to get some free weed. I smoked weed before and medicinal is some low-quality stuff.    Now get off the couch, put the chips down and do yourself some good and get a freakin job.    EDIT:    Weed increases anxiety and also interferes with anti-depressants. THC affects the cannabanoid receptors causing an increase in dopamine produced in the brain, which gets you high, but could also worsen depression to a deadly state, so you don't know what the f u c k you're talking about.    EDIT: I'm not trying to insult you, but you said it first. Listen I totalt understand what you are trying to say, and I'm not saying that weed is bad I support it to become legal but from all the people I do know with depression, weed is a short term affect, and unless your gonna be doling a joint every 4 hours I don't see how otherwise it could work, also going to college and smoking weed wouldn't be a very good idea either. How do you plan on gettig a job? Just because you have a medical marijuana card saying you could smoke doesn't mean that fedeal government supports it. And most companies follow governent regulations other then state regulations and preform drug tests on a regular basis, go to college, get a degree, and do something great with your life, but keep weed out of it, I've seen enough people turned down in several different situations just becuase of drugs not just weed.    EDIT: it's okay I understand your situation, but one of the first things you could do is get of the Prozac, some of the possible side effects are thoughts of suicide which is something you really don't want, I know the weather must be freezing outside in Maine right now, but try to get outside and play sports. Doing this releases endorphins into your body making you feel better, also try taking multi vitamin pills or vitamin d, whichcould help with depression. As for physical pain and by wanting to go to school, just try to stay positive and GO. I know It may sound risky but maybe your friends could help cheer you up. Also eat a lot of nutrient rich food like fruits and vegtables to make your body feel better.     I smoked weed, and absolutely enjoyed it, but there are plenty of other alternatives to make you feel good.    EDIT: you should try a different doctor if the one you are currently with aren't really helping. And if it's possible, try homeschooling or independant study. If you get even more depressed around people maybe try meeting people with similar problems and try to talk things through if possible. Try to find someone that would understand from your point of veiw rather than just writing you a prescription and sending you away, there are specialists for this, you just need to find them    EDIT: no problem but if you do need any other help or need to talk feel free to message or e-mail me|`|I83sYbARaa	First you must immediately get off the Prozac if you are feeling worse and suicidal...

cASB8Sh3aa	It depends on what kind of sick you are.  If you are throwing up then you should test hourly.  If you are not throwing up then every couple of hours is OK.  The risk of not doing it alot is that your sugar can spike due to your illness in a matter of 2 to 3 hours and put you into ketoacidosis.  If that happens you can get super sick and your body can shut down.  Plus there is a high chance that you will have to spend time in the hospital.  It is easier to just test alot and correct as necessary when you feel ill to try to avoid getting worse.  I have been diabetic over 20 years (I am also type I) and I have never had to go to the hospital due to getting sick and then getting ketoacidosis.  I know this is because I test like crazy if I am sick to be on the safe side.|`|0MU16s8Raa	check every hour.   you don't want to end up in hospital (:|`|1wFMGizXaa	Are you Type 1 or Type 2? If you're Type 2, that's probably excessive. While it's true that illness can drive blood sugar up or down, every hour is overkill. Test before and after meals, as well as when you wake up and before you go to bed. If you're Type 1, you might need to test more often because you don't make your own insulin and your blood sugar could rise dramatically, quickly.

At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|osiEeqQHaa	workout!

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	You are telling me that no doctor has tested you for TB?  Go to the county health department and get a TB test, call them first, I am sure that the do that.  I don' think there is any need to get your physician to do it, the county will do it for free.  If it happens to be TB, and hopefully it is not, the treatment for most of it is very good, cheap (free if the county gives you medicine), and that will solve the issue.  I was diagnosed with TB in 1972 and then the treatment was 2 years long, today, with better drugs, it is really short.|`|jK9yiQq6aa	no the doctors didnt say it was normal, coughing up blood isnt normal. do you know what tuberculosis is?
RwfwcS94aa	dont use a paper to smoke salvia  you can make a pipe out of an apple if you need to, but the thing is, if you use a paper, the salvia will not combust fast enough and you will not get a good hit    salvia need to be smoked with a much hotter flame than marijuana to get the full effect because of its chemical makeup  you should use a pipe, load a pinch at a time of salvia, use a jet lighter with a blue flame, and keep the flame on the slavia the entire time you are hitting it.  inhale deep and hold it as long as possible, exhale as slowly as possible    salvia wont get you high in the same way marijuana gets you high, it is closer to a dmt or lsd trip, but it only lasts around 2-7 minutes, depending on the quality of the salvia    if you dont feel it the first time you may need to try a couple of times, salvia is a reverse tollerance drug, so the more you smoke, the stronger the effect|`|exMPHWKHaa	Your not going to really feel anything from a joint.

hIAKXlsNaa	Hi.  I use Secret Clinical Strength.  It smells really good and works very very well.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it since it works so well.  Remember to put it in the bends of your elbows, behind your knees, and on the back of your neck.  You sweat in those places so it helps to put it there too.  Hope it works good for you!  :^)|`|QtII0R54aa	I have hyperhydrosis and my doctor prescribed me Ditropan. I think it's a bladder medication but in low doses it controls sweat (my hands use to drip but now they don't sweat at all as long as I take the pill every morning).|`|b3MtlxSEaa	Try a stronger one like Driclor which contains aluminiun chloride.    Or go to see a doctor (I did) and they can prescribe you a good antiperspirant.    You may have hyperhidrosis (which I doubt because you said 'ewww' which someone who had it would not say because it would make them feel bad about themselves). If you do you can get botox in your armpits (many celebs do before the Oscars, etc).    As for the smell, wash daily and maybe wash your armpits in the sink during the day (after school obviously and not with a top on because it gets wet...trust me). Use a smell deodrant (not non-smell ones) or perfume. Keep body spray handy as well.    You could also keep tissues with you to wipe of sweat or wipes to get rid of the smell.    Hope I helped!|`|CFU77qCbaa	I'm just 10 but I use Body Series. It seems to work for me.
KAyVeRezaa	Shoulder dislocation is the worst. The shoulder is a less stable joint than the knee and once you dislocate your shoulder, you weaken the other ligaments surrounding the joint and there's a good chance for re-occurring subluxations and even dislocations.     ACL tear is not as bad. The only bad thing about it is the recovery after surgery. People that injure their ACL and are more aware of protecting their knee from any further injury because the legs are used more often.     The re-occuring dislocations your having is weakening your shoulder so, if you have insurance, you should get an MRI and see what else may be affected. Get surgery and do the rehab program. Your shoulder would be 90-100% recovered after all that if followed properly.|`|5zTI9G3Taa	I've had both and they both hurt like hell. Neither is good and both required painful operations and long recoveries.|`|nAp688tZaa	I have had both done and have to say that the SLAP tear is harder to recover from than the ACL, but both suck!  If it is not causing you pain or chronic dislocation I would not do the shoulder surgery. I would have both of my knees operated on again versus the shoulder.  It takes way too long to heal.  I spent nearly 8 months in Physical Therapy after that surgery!

2sycPf8Daa	Sorry to hear about your feelings. Honestly, there is no quick fix for life, so you can't expect one. You need to take things slowly, and see how they end up working out. If not go see a counsellor for some help. You're not stuck...stuck is a choice that you've made so make the choice to get unstuck one step at a time but you need to begin to take responsibility for your own life and not blame others for where you are. Getting moving...the sooner you do the sooner you will have both feet unstuck.    Plan to follow your dream. Plan to "do" for the rest of your life, precisely that which you would just love doing almost all the time, in your spare time, when you're robbing time from other chores.   WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MUST BECOME the Best THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY BECOME AT IT. Life won't come to you. You have to go get it. You can decide that your stuck and live everyday with a miserable helplessness, or you can choose to make YOUR choices in YOUR life.    You sound like a great person who's losing themselves in their life. Find some defiance in you. After all, the world runs according to survival of the fittest. By not standing up and making your decisions, you're saying that you're not strong enough to deal with the challenges that thousands of people deal with every day. I'm sure this isn't true. Don't prove it to me or others, prove it to yourself.  Take care as always!|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Is there anything about yourself that makes you self conscious? Do you have a physical feature or is it just part of an introverted personality? Some people try to do act in school plays or take public speaking courses. It may be hard to overcome a tendency toward shyness but it is worth working for. Some people by nature are not very confident and without cause.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	One of the best decisions you make, whether it's now or when you're 45, is when you decide to stop caring so much what people think.    As Judge Judy said: "If you spend your life deferring to someone else, you lose yourself in service. Is that what you want out of your life? It's a high price to be paid for being liked." http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/006092...    The people who put so much effort into being popular and conforming to some kind of ideal don't develop anything else, and so they don't deal with the real world very well when they get out there. Much better to have independent thoughts and do what pleases you. It will be better for you in the long run. Trust me. Or not. Whatever you want.

I tried three brands. First, they slide off your teeth as soon as you put them on. And forget about closing your mouth with them on. Slides even worse. Then you got the twenty minutes to wait. After that, you have to let the gel on your teeth dry. You still can't let your lips touch your teeth because the gel will wash off. I had to use a hair dryer to dry them. Just brush normally and pocket the $30.

SZ6q8Jfxaa	i have the same problem. i lived in florida for 5 years, california, southern alabama all my life and now i'm in illinois. what happens when you move to a northern state or a state where its cloudy, rainy, or cold in the winter and fall is you dont get enough sun. the sun triggers the "happy hormone" in your body, i dont know what its called. the lack of that hormone causes the sad feeling that you feel, and the mundane everything is boring. what helps me is tanning in the winter. its not perfect, but it helps. get a cd of your fav. songs and go tanning. or if youre inside, open the windows on a cold but sunny day. and find someone to share the indoor things that you love. then you wont look forward to spring and summer so much. if it does get so bad that you feel overwhelmed you may want to see a doctor or a therapist because sometimes just talking to someone can make a huge difference.

Sounds like you're not moving around enough, try walking around the block twice a day use the meds the Dr. gave you and try to get a better diet and exercise regimen going, even if your weight isn't causing it I am sure it does not help matters. I am not being critical as I am a big girl myself. But it really doesn't help when we're over weight. But no, it does not sound like restless leg syndrome.

AA12254455	Sorry!  I used to get killer cramps, too.    One of the best over-the-counter medicines is naproxen, which goes by the brand name Aleve.  It's a pain reliever and an anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen, and it may work better for cramps than acetaminophen (brand name = Tylenol).    You can get generic Aleve at any drug store.  You can take 2 pills as your first dose, and then take one pill every 12 hours after that.    Many people find that exercise helps...  If anything, it can distract you.    I think the best way to deal with it is to keep it from getting that bad in the first place- it's easier to prevent pain than it is to get it back under control once it's gotten really bad.  I have a pretty regular period, and I also know when it's coming because I get hot flashes and can't sleep a night or two before I get it each month.  I start taking Aleve then, so it's already in my system when it hits full-force.    It's also something you can talk to your doctor about, if it's bad enough that it's keeping you functioning in work or school, there are options like birth control pills that can make your periods way lighter or even make you not have them at all!  Which is nice!|`|ZaMzRSrraa	heating pad  they have ones at the store you tape to your abdomen( self adhesive ) they come in a box and work very well !!

One of the best ways to prevent type 2 diabetes is to exersise and have a well balanced diet. You should go to the doctors and have your blood presure and sugar checked too. hope i helped(:|`|dByIPgJXaa	Well, you don't have type 1 diabetes because you weren't born with it, and there is no way you could have type II diabetes because of how slim you are. To develope type II diabetes you have to be obese. But in the future there is no saying how your metabolism could change, so you should learn good eating habits now as a kid, so that when you're older you can follow those habits, because when you get older your metabolism could slow down and if you keep eating junk food then there is a chance you could develope diabetes.|`|5zTI9G3Taa	There are 2 types of diabetes. The first type is genetic and you can not do anything to prevent it. Type I diabetes is normally diagnosed early in life, some time before your mid 20's. It is caused by an inability to produce enough insulin (the stuff that deals with the sugar you eat). It is controlled by injecting yourself on a daily basis with insulin.     Type II diabetes (which is what your father most likely has as he was diagnosed at a late age) also has a genetic component but you can do things to help prevent it. Staying fit and healthy, eating a healthy balanced diet and not becoming overweight will all help to decrease the likelihood of getting Type II diabetes. Type II diabetes is more an insensitivity to insulin and is controlled by diet and sometimes tablets and/or injections.|`|qMhUhAALaa	Hello sweetheart, I read your post in here! Does your Dad have type 1 or type 2? Although Diabetes can be inherited and there is some proof that it is passed on, you are smart to keep a look out for it now. Make sure you do your yearly physical and tell your Dr that Diabetes runs in your family, that way they will do an A1c or a fasting test as part of the yearly physical. Diet and excercise is definately a key factor. Knowledge is power, and the fact that you are concerned already tells me you will be fine. Having a fast Metabolism may be your age. Chocolate cravings are in all of us!! lol your fine sweetheart!|`|272432c99dbeec69f81907d1afbeaf20aa	yes exercise will help but you have to have a very well diet like 1or 2 sweets a week.even if you do this you still could get it though if its passed on to you. so hope i helped.|`|xLmtXZJ0aa	Hi,  I am in similar condition because I have a fast metabolism and I exercise a lot and my younger brother has diabetes.  Signs of diabetes are peeing a lot and feeling drowsy.  Diabetes is when your body cant produce insulin and you have to suply it via needles or a pump.  to provent diabetes you need to get lot's of vitamin D and avoid too much sugar, especially if it runs in your family.    PS- this is only for type 1|`|apXIw0ZJaa	Just because your dad has it doesn't mean that you will. Genetics play a VERY small part. But since it does run in your family you should be getting checked for it annually. I am not sure about the fast metabolism though. I had a pretty good metabolism, ate somewhat healthy and exercised daily...but I still got type 1 diabetes. It can happen to anyone. I would suggest getting tested...This website can help you with all you need to know about diabetes. Or you can always ask your dad! :-) Good Luck!    http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/type-1-...
E64juLwJaa	Think he has a taste for it and watched a lot of gay porn.  Communicate and find out.  Planets.|`|0oMiJGBNaa	LOL sorry don t mean to laugh but NO straight guy i have ever known is into that EVER   you either r or ur not.......|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	As far as I am aware the only difference between a straight guy and a gay guy is that gay guys like to have sex with other men....    So why wouldn't a regular straight guy know a lot about gay guys? They're still both guys, guys tend to know what they like and want. Its just gay guys.... are gay.    Additional details: Not even all gay men like to having something shoved up their butt. Some prefer to be the giver rather than the receiver. Seeing as how the majority of men are not gay, I would say no it is not normal (is in unusual) to want something put up your butt.|`|3kaa5Vfkaa	Do you think your husband is secretly gay and has a man on the side?|`|K0iFV73Gaa	I've heard the guy g spot is in the butt hole. However I don't want anything up my butt. I don't want to know anything about gay stuff anddont care. Communication is key...I thnk I'm only16. I'm straight and how would I know bout gays? How, if I was gay. That is my opinion. Maybe he has a creapy past or was molested. Was he in the navy? Family friend had that problem.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Thtas weird. My husband doesnt know anything about gay stuff.      Well ive seen straight guys that like putting stuff there. For me its too extrange. Talk to him about it.
gkqmrIAGaa	Seroquel is very good for helping you to sleep but this dosage is way to high. You need to talk to your doctor about trying a lower dosage. You should be very proud of yourself for stopping the alcohol. I hope everything works out for you and your child. You sound like a mother trying very hard to do the right thing and I wish you success.|`|O7nyzkGdaa	When i first went on seroquel i had tremors and i thought they were never going to go away, i thought i was going to have parkinsons i think its called, eventually my side effects diminished, so you should try it for a few weeks, then talk to your dr. I think they didnt go through 10 years of school to lie to you.|`|94NYYq5Haa	Seroquel is associated with a number of side effects, which for many are worse than moderate anxiety symptoms.  I would never take it for those purposes.  I'm also wondering what a judge will think of you being prescribed an antipsychotic.  This is probably a bad choice of medications for you.  There are many, many other options.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I take 75mg. to 100mg. for sleep.  Seroquel makes you sleepy, and everyone is different...our bodies are different...so for some 100mg. or 200mg. may be too much or too little.  I went as high as 300mg., and that was way too much for me.  I didn't react well with that dosage, but I do well with what I'm on now.  So work with your doctor and tell him exactly your reaction and he should decrease it to what level is best for your body.    It may seem to you like the doctor gave you Seroquel for alcoholism, but if you told him you were using alcohol for insomnia...alcohol has the opposite effect.  It gives you an erratic sleep...you pass out and awake and pass out and awake, etc....you don't sleep well with alcohol.  And of course in high doses, alcohol is not good for your physical health, mental health and spiritual health.  The only cure for alcoholism is abstinence and going to AA meetings.  Check in your community for a meeting...there are many meetings...and there are women-only AA mtngs. because some women feel more comfortable talking with other women about sensitive issues.  Take Care and Good Luck.
NUDpnREEaa	I'm 12 and I've been through a stage where I felt like everyone at my school thought I was ugly and didn't like me. I went on forever thinking that until I turned to God for help. Since then I've stopped feeling that way and I've even made a couple of friends. So here's the moral of the story: When you turn to God for help, He will make your problem better. Maybe not right away, but He will. Trust me.|`|voGSTX1Saa	I also agree with the kitten thing.. Animals really help..    But, you need to tell your mom about these feelings... It could be a side affect of the medicine. Sometimes in teenagers and young adults it can have a reverse affect and make you feel worse. Have your mom call your doctor and they can try some different meds that will work for you.. hang in there sweetie:)|`|R5G9h2ygaa	I say you should consciously try and change your outlook on life and try to appreciate peoples differences rather than scorn them. The source of almost all hate between people is their differences. This doesnt make a whole lot of sense but its true. U should also try and embrace challenges in your life as a chance for self improvement rather than a burden|`|3meIiIsmaa	Call your Dr. and make an appointment to talk with her - you may need your meds adjusted.  You are 14 and have so much to live for - and so much life to experience, and so much to contribute to make the world a better place because you were in it.  Please don't consider taking your life.  That is a permanent solution to temporary problems.  It is something you can not do over.   It takes a while for meds to kick in - give yourself time to adjust. But let your Dr. know how you are doing now - and please get into therapy -  part of your problem may be hormones or a chemical imbalance. Give your therapy a little more time.  God Bless you ---|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Lots of people feel like this. Maybe the key is to appreciate things more. You say: "i loved my fam, my friends, my school, the world and even life in general" - what more could you want? You may just need to remind yourself how lucky you are. It's very easy to focus on things that you don't have and take for granted what you do. "Count your blessings" as they say. Watch Schindler's List if you need to be shown how good you've got it.    Perhaps I'm way off, and I'm truly sorry if I wasn't more help, but I think you need to decide what's important and then not let all the other things bother you. Just relax.|`|H1YQ14Haaa	Get a kitten.  Kittens always make everything better...  You CANNOT hate a cute, innocent little kitten.|`|NqOxQzlraa	"but for some reason, now that i dont hate myself as much, i hate everything alot more than i did before"    Therein lies the issue and potential solution.  Instead of thinking automatically bad stuff when things are good, think automatically of good stuff when things are bad.    Hope that helps.|`|Rruh4lvtaa	tell your mom ..... before your'e like me!..... and plus she should know. maybe you shouldn't take any medicine but idk.    and we will all miss you if you leave us.  I will be like super depressed for like ever and i will  miss you the mostest out of everyone.     ooh and for the cat thing  get a hairless cat lol or or umm idk lol
AA12254455	You can swim when you have your period.  Did someone tell you that you couldn't?  There's nothing that you can't do while you're on your period.  Period!    However, you would not want to wear a maxi pad in your swimsuit while swimming.  That would get all wet and be gross.  You would need to use a tampon instead.    Sometimes younger girls aren't comfortable using tampons for a while after they start their periods for the first time, and they only use pads.  In that case, they wouldn't swim while on their periods.  Maybe that's why you thought it wasn't okay.|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	use a tampon.. it wont leak|`|30iQkwJlaa	wear a tampon.|`|hRRsnfglaa	HELLO DUMMY NOT UNLESS WANT THE WHOLE POOL TO LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY WAS MURDERED THERE|`|AA11286455	Use a tampon.|`|R3AN5WO0aa	if its in the ocean well then yea some animals like ummm sharks like blood  but in a pool itll leak through ur bikini  and stain and when u swim youll have this red area around you      get one of those sports tampon that adjust to your body if ur going swimming|`|LMRaSXFeaa	you can swim, just use a tampon.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	You can, but you'll have to wear a tampon.

Many STD's are transmitted by blood.  while they stand little chance of living long in pool water. What would you think about swimming in a pool that boys were pumping semen into.       Well.  The same is true blood or pee.  Still Pee is actually sterile and many young people pee in pools.  When they get older they figure it out but if you see youngsters... Well..  You are swimming in their pee.   We all know it but who cares.  Fish pee in the water too.    Where I lived it was against the law for women to swim in the river during the summer month.   ( The reason :  ?? )    Piranha are attracted to blood and there would be no chance to get away if the detected a woman in her period.   Keep in mind that sharks and other fish can detect one drop of blood from several hundred feet if the current takes it past them.    Its like detecting a 1.5 volt battery from 20 miles !  So the next time you enter water there may be other reasons for you to reconsider your decision.  Not all females know exactly when they will bleed.    I hope this helps...|`|Oq7gDQPzaa	well thats not true you can swim while on your period just swim with a tampon in|`|0QXQu5hvaa	because you will bleed in the pool  you can use a tampon if you want to go swimming while on you period.  how old r u...?|`|XwVaWbrzaa	well i guess you could swim while on your period but wear a tampon, not a pad, it will get all big and it will look like you went  2 in ur bathing suit    hope i helped|`|ijGBvjMwaa	Tampons.

g3AdLLUPaa	Just like you, thousands of people from all over the world suffer from mild to moderate acne, and just like you they have tried everything with little or no results. Knowing that topical chemicals can be harsh, we spent years researching and developing a solution that is safe and works to cleanse the entire body.    Acne is caused from imbalances and impurities within the body, and that's why we treat the problem an internal cleansing treatment that goes right to the source and fights acne before it even begins. Acnezine provides antioxidants that can help eliminate the free radicals that may cause mild acne.
AA11707096	Depending on the root of this fear it's called either Phagophobia or Anginophobia.  A phobia is an abnormal and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels you avoid it, even though you are aware it is harmless. So, yeah, thinking you'll choke every time you eat could be considered phobic. If you believe phobias are effed up, then you might feel effed up.  I wouldn't let yourself get too worked up, unless at some point it causes you to stop eating. There is probably a phobia for everything we think or feel or fear.  Check out the phobia list links below. I included two Google searches for you, as well:|`|alyr0SB8aa	I went through the same thing once, I thought I forgot how to chew and swallow and got scared of eating.<br>  Just ignore it or try to block it out with something else (watch Tv while eating and you'll probably forget about it).|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	You need to breath slowly and fully when you are eating to calm yourself down.  It is not unusual.  But you need to get some help to get over it.|`|tfgAayNgaa	haha I once knew a person who had a phobia of puppies, not dogs, but puppies.

Really not a way to treat a phobia, but most have em, phobias of spiders,snakes,heart attacks etc. Whenever you feel the phobia start put your mind on something that makes you happy, beach etc. You must not overthink your phobia or it will just get worse. Some might say hynossis might work but im not convinced about that<br>  <br>  <br>  by that happening to you at an early age yes it can help cause the phobia, you experienced a scary situation  at an early age and im sure as a child everything is terrible and sticks with you.|`|b95d3948683c7afd43c89eba8e412306aa	Phagophobia- a fear of swallowing. it is expressed in various swallowing complaints without any apparent physical reason detectable by physical inspection and Laboratory analysis. An obsolete term for the fear of choking.<br>      Phagophobia may lead to ( and be confused with ) fear of eating, and subsequent malnutrition and weight loss.

5M0FBU89aa	This is a special kind of crown, called an "extended root crown" -   If it goes below the gum line - If your tooth broke at the gum line, they're gonna have to drill below it to get a good contact margin.       It typically costs a couple hundred more and insurance rarely pays for it.     As long as the root remains healthy, the dentist will probably not recommend a root canal- but if you have root pain, (s)he will prolly recommend that as well, because otherwise you'll have pain after all the work is done and (s)he'l have to drill thru it- possibly cracking it.    Alternatively, (s)he may pull 1 or two and recommend a bridge... but a 2-tooth span of a bridge may not adhere.    Good luck,|`|XJEGTZJqaa	Def put in fakes in and stratin those crooked 1z|`|VnQymt4Raa	I've seen this so many times in the office I work at. From what you have described, you don't have that much tooth left. No matter what you will HAVE to have a root canal, there is no getting around that. To be honest, I am 90% positive you will have the teeth removed. You cannot have a bridge there because it's two teeth in a row so a bridge is not possible. You can have dentures, but most likely you will need implants. They will put a screw into your bone and then put a crown on top of that. They will definately put the implants in so that you will not need braces. You are paying for the implants so you want them to look nice. They wouldn't put fake teeth in and then make you get braces on top of that. You would go to an oral surgeon or a dentist that does implants. An orthodontist does not deal with fake teeth.
IgNADy1Taa	It's not how much you eat that keeps you satisfied, but what you eat. Does what you eat differ on days where you feel hungry as opposed to days where you don't?    Fibruous foods like vegetables/fruit/wholemeal products stay in the stomach longer (and are bulkier) so generally tend to make people feel fuller.    Complex carbohydrates like pasta and bread release sugar/energy into the bloodstream slowly, so you don't get cravings until far later - whereas with simple sugars like candy/chocolate etc you get a rush and then a low which makes you crave more and more. I too could eat something like chocolate bars all day and still feel hungry!     Bottom line: you should really try to figure out what it is you do differently on days you feel much hungrier. Do you engage in more physical activity? Do you have less sleep (not enough sleep makes you hungry throughout the day)? Do you have more simple sugar which causes cravings? Do you go without something you normally have - e.g. coffee - that might normally curb your appetite?|`|jgpESnd7aa	Hi  you need to have a balanced diet  depends what you consume ...

gemaW0KQaa	Your body will stop losing weight completely because it will try to conserve what you do consume.  You should eat more (1000 calories a day) and exercise 5 days a week vs. than 3.      Eat 6 small healthy meals that add up to 1000 calories.    The idea is to burn more than what you eat -without starving yourself.  Try doing cardio for 1 hour 5 days a week and watch what you eat.  Your meals can consist of:    Morning -Yogurt  2nd breakfast/snack -toast  lunch -wrap  snack -fruit  dinner-salad  snack    Good Luck and don't starve yourself. :)|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	you don't need to lose any weight...if you want to get FIT and firm. just work on light weights and crunches. etc. and eat a BALANCED meal. you're starving yourself if you keep that up...    sorry that's not what you wanted to read.|`|J3A9Pqq2aa	None, because your body will go in starvation mode actually preventing weight loss.|`|ua9zB4vTaa	I know you might not realise this now, but you're skinny. 5 years from now you're going to look at a photo of you at age 15 and go "Why the hell did I think I was overweight?"

0I9Fm00Naa	Half of your ability to quit is to have the sincere desire to quit.Change your habits, If you normally would get up in the morning and smoke ,try putting it off until after you have breakfast.If you smoke when your drive ,stop smoking in your car as well , If your going to go someplace (like the grocery store or gas station ) leave your cigarettes and lighter home. Remove the items that would trigger you into smoking a cigarette ( Pack of Smokes, Ashtray's,lighters etc) if you don't see it chances are you won't have the desire as often, so keep them out of your sight.Try cutting back , instead of smoking a whole one ,only take a couple of puff's and put it out, ( I know there expensive but you can get a metal or ceramic piece to put it out and the next time you have the desire use the one you had used previously) Don't try to quit cold turkey,If your smoking a full flavor , switch to lites, the next pack switch to ultra lites.The key  is to slowly reduce the nicotine dependence , you will get use to the liter brands . Talk to your doctor about using Zyban or Wellbutrin They are both the same and affect the area in the brain that causes you to have the urge to smoke. Try to occupy some of your free time by getting a hobby , Bake a cake or make some cookies. anything that will get your mind off smoking.To sum it up: Change your smoking habits, Remove The triggers that give you the urge, cut down and switch to a liter brand, Get a hobby to occupy your hands and get it off your mind.Talk to your Health Care Provider about Zyban or Wellbutrin.|`|ebd0709787e62f7161e7f80c6c1daffaaa	Every time you have a craving replace with one thing such as tea or whatever you choose and eventually your body with think of tea or whatever you choose when you want a cigarette .

I am working on a plan of improving my life with vitamins Omega 3, Calcium, Magnesium and vitamin D.  I am also eating healthier and getting more exercise and trying to focus on the good things in my life instead of the things that stress me out.  If you do have to have a prescription, start at the lowest dose possible, keep in contact with your Dr. about side effects. Brain fog, blurry visions, lack of concentration etc.    Just popping in here to let you know, I agree, personality disorders are  a reallly difficult thing to deal with, and to let you know I care enough about what you are going through so you don't have to go through what I went through in withdrawals.  I hope not only you, but my self can solve this problem in a healthy way that works for us.     I should know with in a week or two if what I am doing works.  I know I will not get on addictive drugs again because they were ruining my life.|`|TeIDixQTaa	I've been on and off many types of antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedatives and anti-anxiety pills since I was a youngster.  I don't want to give bad advice, but none of them have ever worked for me. All I experienced were the negative side effects, which made my moods far FAR worse. However, the medical service in Ireland is useless, so perhaps you may have a better experience.|`|0guifP2xaa	Yes there are medications that can help you.  First you need to see a phychiatrist you could possibly have bi-polar dissorder a very common illness that can be easily treated.  Illegal drugs or alcohol will only make the problem worse trust me I know from experience.  Good luck|`|gkqmrIAGaa	I have a family member with BPD and I know that you are suffering. There are many safe medications that can help you. You should be taking an antidepressant and an antipsychotic to stop the anger. With the antidepressants one will work for one person but not another. If yours isn't working you will want to change. If after 3 to 4 weeks you are not feeling better you need a change.  There is a very good book written by someone who grew up with BPD and how she has been able to learn to lead a normal life. It is called "I Hate You, Don't Leave Me"  It is a really helpful book. There are therapies specifically designed for those who have BPD. One is Cognitive Restructuring Therapy which helps you change how you feel about yourself and how to like yourself. Another is Emotion Regulation that teaches you healthy skills to deal with the anger and the feelings of lonliness and abandonment issues. There is also a new one called EMDR which is new and revolutionary and works pretty quickly.  I hope that you are persistent in getting help. It is there and can help change your life for the better.  I wish you the best!
2SgsPKF9aa	PLEASEdo me a favor and show this answer to your parents. I have a son who is 25 and has been suffering social anxiety disorder since his teens. He has been called lazy, a slacker and depressed. It is none of that. It is a true disorder. It NEEDS to be taken care of by a doctor and therapists. You can get better with help and the SUPPORT of your parents. Look up social anxiety disorder on the internet and read it. And let your parents read it and tell them that is how you feel. If they still do not want to recognize that you have a real problem then my honest suggestion to you is to call an ambulance and tell them you feel suicidal and your parents will not help you. They will put you on the behavioral health floor of the hospital to be evaluated.It might sound scary but I don't want you to die. I feel for you as I saw my son suffer for so long and he is just now after some therapy getting more confident and is feeling better about himself. I takes time but you need help NOW not tomorrow since you are feeling so desperate.If someone does not have a disorder or know someone that has it, they do not know how bad it can be.I can and my son can.Please show them this and show them an internet article about your disorder.They would risk the chance of losing you either to suicide or through social services taking you away from them for denying to get you treatment. Good luck to you and hang in there, there is hope and help out there.|`|QEPC7nveaa	Please! Don't kill yourself! It's not worth it! You CAN get through it. I would know.   I'm 17 and day by day my social anxiety is getting better with the help of the kind people on this website:  http://www.livinganxious.com/    It's like myspace for people with social anxiety. It's wonderful. You can post blogs about your day to day struggle with anything (including social anxiety) and people will respond and try to help you. You get used to talking to different people on the site, and you gain the confidence you need to talk to people in real life. There are many different age groups on the site. Some are young like us (I'm 17) and some are older. Some have been suffering with social anxiety their entire life whereas for some it's a newly aquired disease. Some people have absolutely no people to turn to and the ones they do are just cruel. Some have friends and family that want to help, but they still feel like they're by themselves and alone. I really think you should give the site a try. You can take your mind off of your social anxiety by playing in the arcade, chatting in the chatroom, or going on the forums. Whatever you want!    I hope to see you there! Look me up, my username is kissme. :D|`|0rpN2419aa	I am so sorry, I don't know why kids have to be mean and ruin people's lives. A girl made fun of me in school and it was awful,  She got a bunch of kids with her.  But guess what, guess who has the most friends now, she made fun of lots of kids and never comes around. The bullies eventually lose their friends unless they have a mental health problems and have gotten help.   You are worrying a lot about that other kids might be laughing at you, and hopefully, they aren't.  Be a good listener when the others are talking to you.  I found this is what worked best for me.  I have a bit of a problem like you do, with what shall I say, so I just listen, laugh with them, feel bad with them, care with them, I have to take the focus off me.  People care...the bullies are the one with the major problems!  I really hope things get better for you.  Pleease, don't think of commiting suicide.  That worries me.   The mental pain does cause physical pain.  You might talk to your parents a little more about what your feelings are and how you are being treated to make you feel this way.  I have a real close connection with my grandchildren ages 6 to 23 and we always talk things out.  I do have anxiety and am working on it.  Just smile, listen, and be friendly.  Remember as I said, focusing on the other person instead of yourself helps.  There must be some nice girls in your school.  Maybe a new girl and you can help her find her way around and help her.  If you think negative thoughts, it will show in your  expression.  Please take good care of yourself and think positively.  There are people out here who care about you,  I do and that is why I am hoping I can help you.|`|a0Wf8RXBaa	i think you would be best going to see your doctor, tell them how you feel. maybe then you could go and see a counsellor to get to the bottom of whats going on with your anxiety, they will listen and help you.(don't give up).

Or something else.<br>  -Not eating enough. <br>  -Being underweight. <br>  My best advise is, if your blood comes back negative then tell your doctor, work out what stress's you have in your life and how to minimise them. Maybe get a counsellor? Doctors will get you in contact with them. My thought is that you are pregnant, and it may be to early to know through a test.

346683d356126a2c7bdb62721d918419aa	Hi erin, I feel your pain! : (      There are two tried and true [safe] home remedies I know about on getting rid of [Navi] skin moles.    [1] Take a clove of garlic, cut in two halves. Then place the cut part of the garlic on the mole. Leave on overnight by securing it with a bandage.  The sulfur juices in the garlic will work on the mole'    Withing 2-3 days the mole should be gone!      [2] Slice a potato on place it on the mole same procedure as the garlic.  Do this for several nights as you retire.You will find the mole has begun to disappear.    Make sure your taking in enough potassium in your diet. Potassium among other health benefits is very helpful in the removal process of moles.You can take Apple Cider Vinegar on a daily basis which is a rich source of potassium such as bananas and potatoes are.    Note: Don't ever pick a mole!! And make sure the moles are not malignant and possible cancer tumors by getting a skin specialist to check them out.      I hope I really helped you.    God Bless,     ' J '|`|Ho9bF2Ccaa	You really should not try to remove them yourself because they will leave scars. A Dermatologist can remove them safely without scars/infections & if you have health insurance, it may be fully covered. But, if you just want to hide them for modeling, you should try cover creams. www.dermablend.com has good cover creams that could cover almost any skin imperfection up. Hope that helped!
3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	My daughter also has asthma that gets worse when she has a cold. She has a nebulizer at home and when it gets bad her doctor has her on atrovent and pulmicort together, then four hours later albuterol and continue that way until the symptoms subside. So basically I would see if your insurance would pay for you to have a nebulizer at home (if you don't already have one). We have been able to avoid some asthma attacks by not taking any antihistamines or decongestants. She uses saline nose sprays instead. We also use a cool mist humidifier when she starts to get a cold. Loads of liquids and she chokes down licorice tea because that was a suggestion by a health food store. I hope this helps. The nebulizer therapy was finally given to her after she missed many days of school. She went to see an asthma specialist and this is the plan he came up with. Fortunately other than when she gets a cold, her asthma is in control. Maybe your parents could find an asthma specialist for you too. Good Luck!|`|wLHjvTuBaa	go to the hospital and tell them whats wrong then tell them to stop healing you every time and just tell you how to heal yourself also you might want to have some hot water and sleep warm

nAp688tZaa	There is a moderate drug interaction between these two medications because they both act on the central nervous system and could depress breathing and heart rate, as well as lower the blood pressure significantly.  Assuming that both have been prescribed to you, call the pharmacist and make sure that it is safe to take them together.  It would also be advisable to have someone with you that knows exactly what you have taken and when.  This person should watch for any signs of distressed breathing, confusion, extreme dizziness and fatigue, and fainting.  They would be able to take you into the hospital if something happens.  Even if the pharmacist says it is safe to take them together, you should still be careful if you have never taken them together before.  Xanax is a pretty strong anti-anxiety med that usually puts people to sleep, so you may not even need the Flexeril.|`|4hfZir8zaa	Why are you taking xanax for muscle relaxers? those are downers. I would stop taking those if I were you
KC5vBg4uaa	george, bad breath may be true, but yellow teeth is not a short term affect unless you smoke yellow die or something.    I've never done tobacco before, but supposedly it just makes you feel a little light headed and relaxed.    Marijuana makes you high and makes you more emotional, makes music sound good, makes you hungry, makes you tired, makes your short term memory bad (short term only, not long term like many anti-drug people would have you believe).    There's plenty of other stuff one could smoke but these are the more common ones (I've only ever done marijuana).|`|9oCbI6pBaa	bad breath yellow teeth|`|kj507W26aa	Smoke what ?

Ho9bF2Ccaa	Yes, that count towards the 8 glasses of fluid a day. Green Tea is even better because it has anti-oxidants in it!|`|8e7e2fd391e28bb3b4818c8a3c3bee59aa	Yes, for the most part.  Green tea has some slight amount of caffeine which can cause you to urinate more, but the amount of water loose is way way compensated by the amount of water you put in.|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	Sure.  Caffeine no longer causes dehydration I guess. These are the same people who changed the rules against swimming after 2 hours.|`|845400aac246186231a221a901d00121aa	Yes. It's still water, it's just got a little flavouring, colouring and caffeine in it.    You might be better off with orange cordial, however.|`|419b54befe425a1ea6fbb7f00aaf095aaa	No, green-tea does not count as water. You have to have just plain water for it to count as water.|`|ulLvajqfaa	Absolutely! If it's just green tea and nothing else added, than think of it like super-charged water. The caffeine in green tea is negligible in my opinion.
Jswomud7aa	You don't need a degree at all.    In fact, if an office is willing to train you, you don't even need a certificate (but in order to get a job it's helpful to have gone to D.A. school)    There are many schools that offer a dental or medical assistant program that can be completed in about 8 months to one year.    PS To be a hygienist you would need a 4-year degree... at that point why not just be a dentist? it's only 2 more years...|`|qPd5G3dSaa	instead of going with an assistant which, you need to be certified most likely, go to college for 2 years get your associates in dental hygene and have your own room in an office... you will not have to deal with the dentist, just clean peoples teeth... which is a great beniffit because some dentists are cranky and YOU will not have to deal with them with other patients besides if a patient needs a procedure|`|vXa7IeDiaa	i am pretty sure you just need a certificate..they have dental assisting classes at trade schools..like bryman college..western career college..i'm not sure if these schools are in your area..i'm from the west coast..the bay area..and these trade schools offer that class..|`|b3JKcQXGaa	Not sure, but here's a great site!

AA12082265	Zoloft is famous for the side effects of lightheadness, fast heartbeat and chest pain-like symptoms.. Ask your doctor to put you on paxil which is also an SSRI and is in the same family of drugs as zoloft...But has lesser side effects.. I cannot believe the doctor has not picked up on this.

I used to have a lot of sinus and allergy problems and since I have discovered the netpot I've not had them nearly as bad. The one I got already had a bunch of packets of the mixture in the box with the pot when I bought it. Follow the directions on the box and use that at least once in the morning and once right before bed. I know it sounds gross to use a kettle looking thing to pour salt water through your nose but it's better than a botched recital.  Also push the bottled water. Usually when you have any type of sinus problem it's due to being dehydrated. the coughing and sore throat is most likely due to the draining from the runny nose. watery eyes due to that and allergies. and the sore tummy is because all of the mucus is draining into your stomach. The saline nasal spray is a quick fix when you're on the go throughout the day. Good luck!|`|I83sYbARaa	It isnt true that there is no cure for virus....  the chinese medicine have had it for thousand s of years, it is just that western medicine wont recognize it, and dont tell people, many doctors dont know it themselves.....  In the short run look in your phone book under acupuncturists who normally have herbal remedies and ask for GAN MAO LING.... that should do it....or get a referral number for a traditional chinese medical doctor... or call an asian store and ask them for it...  There are many others formulas but that will probably be the most likely one they would have on hand...  mentha (peppermint) and licorice are the known teas to soothe the throat......     For those of you who dont believe this, look it up yourselves, and then ask yourself how many other things doctors either dont know, or dont tell you.....  you'll be amazed, and if you get into it, eventually outraged.........   peace

Thus, the benefit of the operation may not outweigh the risk.|`|msNXomjTaa	I also have prism lenses.<br>  <br>  The laser will correct other problems, like astigmatism.  However, the prism is to correct crossed eyes, or eyes that do not track properly (lazy eye).  To correct this, you need surgery.  Laser surgery would still result in your eyes looking the wrong direction, and you would still need prism glasses.  You just might need less correction for the other things that might be wrong.

IKakoOfyaa	Staph is a bacterial infection that needs treatment with antibiotics to cure.  It may be highly contagious.|`|RXRmRmqpaa	staph is short for staphylococcus which is a bacteria & has a number of different species. It normally resides on the skin of healthy people and usually causes no problem in healthy individuals. It can cause a problem is you have low immunity, are ill or have open wounds. MRSA stands for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Which basically means it is a strain of the staph bacteria which is resistant to many antibiotic treatments. And some people carry MRSA on their skin particularly in the nose, armpits and groin without being aware of this, and it only causes them a problem if they have an operation or become very ill. Of course if they carry MRSA they can pass it on to ill people by touching them and cause them to be ill because they are too weak to fight the infection and it is allowed to spread, or it can get into an open wound and cause a lot of problems. This is why hospitals ask visitors to use alcohol gel hand rubs to prevent spreading infection to patients, and restrict physical contact with ill patients. Hope this helps to explain.|`|JS2QJfdMaa	staph infection is a skin irritation you get and it comes with a fever  and it's very harmful.  you get it from i think, touching something that someone who has it touched.i think...can probably google it to make sure.
AA10725882	Referring to one answer above - pancreatic carcinomas are usually not among the fastest growing.  They are so deadly because they are only found at the very end stage of a long disease process.  They have usually been growing for long periods of time "under the radar" before they cause symptoms or signs that lead to late stage diagnosis.    Small cell lung cancer generally grow faster than the several non-small cell lung cancer types.  That is why they respond much better to chemotherapy.    Some of the two dozen plus types of lymphoma grow very fast - and they can shrink very fast with chemotherapy. Sometimes large lymphoma masses shrink so fast that patients become sick (kidney and metabolic problems) from the rapid destruction of so many tumor cells.    Undifferentiated or poorly differentiated malignancies of many types often have high growth fractions.  One of the fastest tumor growths I saw in 20 years as a cancer doctor was a poorly differentiated facial (mandibular) sarcoma that literally doubled in size over three weeks - even after a cycle of very expensive chemotherapy.  Fortunately we switched to different combination chemotherapy plus radiation and surgery that gained a complete lasting remission in that teen age woman.    The bottoms line is that growth rates vary tremendously even within specific cancer types.  Each person's malignancy is different.  No two women with breast cancer are exactly alike.  Some breast cancers progress very aggressively, and some grow very slowly.  There is wide variation between cases of prostate cancer in men.    Cancers are far more complicated diseases than most people realize.    As for preventing lung cancer after smoking cessation, many people have ideas and anecdotal suggestions, but nothing is better than simply not using tobacco further and surviving for the number of years required for the risk of lung cancer to diminish.   Exactly how many years this takes is also highly variable and debatable from statistics.    I know it is frustrating to receive seemingly "wishy washy" answers from cancer doctors.  We simply do not have all of the answers for each individual person.  Our bodies, our susceptibilities, and our malignant disease are all very much individualized.  Statistics never tell us what to expect in any one special person.|`|8e7e2fd391e28bb3b4818c8a3c3bee59aa	Its really hard to say.  Cancers of specific organs (mouth, throat, lung, etc.) come in different types and each have its own natural history.  Lung cancer however is the most deadly.  For the most part it is because it's usually not detected until pretty late in the disease, there is almost no symptoms in early stage lung cancer.  In contrast mouth and throat cancer are usually found earlier because it much harder to miss a mass in your mouth or throat.      The best thing to reduce cancer risk is to stop smoking.  Study have show that after 3 years of stopping smoking the risk is reduced by 30%, and 50% after 10 years.|`|I83sYbARaa	Actually pancreatic cancer is the fastest most deadly cancer, i think brain cancer is next, but it truely depends on the individual..... the best way I have researched to prevent cancer is to alkalize your body and keep it in the right ph range...  usually between 6.5 and 7.5....   you will have to research this, but there are several alkalizing agents that must be used responsibly and with caution, and knowledge, or you could make something else worse, like upsetting your enzymes, or mineral balances.... so be careful...  find knowledgeable people to talk to , not just anyone on the internet...  Western doctors dont know how to prevent cancer.,, the only ones trying and doing is successfully are people into alternatives, for which western doctors attack all the time...  Lung cancers usually progress slowly....  The nicotine and harmful substances leave the body relatively quickly, it is the damage done by them that is harder to fix.....   start walking to increase oxygen content in your body and circulation....  and you may want to look into traditional chinese medicine for herbal formulas specific to your needs.... try looking for articles by dr. subhuti dharmananda.....    there are many qualified good herbalists... good luck   ask an ear/nose/throat doctor for the ultraviolet screen of your mouth...  oxygen kills/prevents cancer, too.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes .  -We should go to a laboratory and you should smoke and do as I show and take blood test ,then only we can believe that that method is   working for you  -You can write  e mails to me|`|bznwjAI7aa	I do not know which cancer grows the fastest but I can say with certainty that smoking can cause mouth cancer even after you quit.    My cousin chewed tobacco for 3 years but then he quit for 5 years. And after 5 years of no tobacco at all (or any types of drugs or alcohol), he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. So the moral of the story is, it doesn't matter how long you use tobacco and for how long you quit. It all depends on your body so the best thing to do is to avoid tobacco (cigars, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, etc.) all together.
uJU7jGtHaa	why have you not been eating? if your not eating coz u are ill they might just see whats wrong with you???<br>  then he will probably talk to you about your problems, if theres something wrong with you it needs to be sorted. you cant go without food. maybe your depressed? i dunno. the doctor aint scary and if your that worried about going on your own then take a friend or someone x|`|3qLIRorjaa	Tell you to eat...|`|vrfuO9Asaa	the sme 2 me i do eat but a lil and i can never get 2 sleep easily.x|`|JWYs2pBgaa	sounds to me like the problem isn't 'medical' as such, as in not something you've caught.. sounds to me like you're having some kind of how can i put this politely lol sounds like you could have things on your mind that is bothering you, getting to you, that's what you need to deal with when you deal with that, and the only way to deal with that is openly and honestly (to yourself mostly) then you can deal with the physical side of things.  You do need to see your doctor, but you do need to tell him/her the truth about the 'not a good place in your head' then they will have a basis to work from.<br>  <br>  hope things get better|`|yqFIDnfBaa	Have courage and I am sure every thing will be alright.

SScijhn5aa	It's a stress headache. Your to stressed! You need to calm down. I get those all the time. And changing classes won't help. I find that if I drink coffee, or eat some with sugar in it, I feel better. I had to go to the ER because they got so bad. They put me on this medicine which is made from caffeine. So go to the Dr. if it gets worse. Or if you feel one coming on, put your head down and rest a bit. Just don't fall asleep, in school!   GL

K0G3BZRwaa	Okay I have consuling 2.  To get out of it    On the first visit Act normal like nothings wrong and try not to look at her  Then Say you have a lot of friends  Then talk about how you love her dog, still not looking at her  She'll think your a normal happy little person and send you away to never come back    I wanted to do that but my consular turned out nice and nothing like my mom described :)    Don't judge her if you don't know her. Thats wrong|`|QMAqzpKEaa	It's not a psychiatrist or psychologist. It is just a counselor. It may sound scary but it's someone you can chat to who will keep everything you say confidential and not judge you. Some people have to pay 30/hour or more to see one and you're getting one free!  In the U.K counselors are looked at with scepticism but in the US everyone has a counselor or "shrink".  It does not mean your not normal or you are mentally ill if you are seeing a counselor.   Your mum probably thinks that you need to talk to someone and she does not feel equipped to deal with it herself. It does not make her a bad parent though. She is a good parent because she recognises that it can be easier for an individual or child to talk to a stranger than to family at times. It is sometimes harder to express feelings to a stranger, as you feel less judged than by those you know.|`|kkXc4hAIaa	u to god i though i was the only one my mom making me go to a counselor tomorrow and i don't want to, gl|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	make her think your really happy. but if your mom is sending you, then you probbly need it.|`|9Em45SYLaa	don't say the words I DONT NEED COUNSLING sure sign of hiding something at least thats what they say try not to seem nervous just be urself     try to avoid eye contact with the dog it will just make you seem creepy|`|ezI5HwRWaa	If your mom is taking you to a counselor then she probably feels that you need it. Don't be afraid of it. That person is there to help you. It will be a little awkward or uncomfortable at first, but things should get better. If they don't, tell your mom that you don't like it and it isn't helping you. Go into this with an open mind, because they might be able to help you, but only if you give them a chance.    If you feel comfortable with this, maybe you could ask your mom to stay with you the first time, if it's ok with the counselor.    I would have been greatful to have been able to see a counselor years ago when I was depressed. Take this opportunity.

Im a guy and for some strange reason, i mean i know its suppose to be normal, but I watch a lot of porn. I feel addicted. I watch way more than most people that I know. What i have figured out that works is finding a sex partner and actually having sex. It really reduces the urge to do the things that I do without them. Masturbation is also a good out. There is nothing wrong with that. Its all natural. If someone wants to judge you for that then just dont worry about it. You probably get more than they do anyways. Haha. But anyways thats about the best advice I can give. I hoped this helped you out. :)|`|623zz8d7aa	Call  your local hospital and ask to speak to a mental health professional. Make an appointment.

One obsesses over sex and sexual situations to the point that they compulsively act it out. Once acted out, they continue to obsess and act out. A never ending loop. It is not just enough to tell someone to stop thinking about it. The mind has it's own agenda and if sexual thoughts raise the levels of mood altering chemicals in the brain, then the brain will want more and more of it, creating and tempting you into the obsession. There are 12 step groups that deal with sexual and compulsive addictions. They can give you the tools necessary to deal with the compulsive and obsessive aspects. They can also give you a place to feel free to be who you are as well as an opportunity to help others. SAA and SLA are two that come to mind. Hang in there. Like all addictions this too can take everything from you, by leading you into unhealthy and dangerous relationships where disease and drug use are prominent. Contact a local 12 step group and talk to someone. They know what you are going through and will walk you through the steps. A good book is, "Out of the Shadows" by Patrick Carnes.    Good luck.
Q0v41NA1aa	Try talking to an ambulance service in the area,they should be able to give you information.  I took mine through one.
6NA2MXNPaa	Do you have a primary care doctor? If so, forget the ER doc, contact your primary doctor and have him/her schedule it or refer you to the place you'd go to get it done. Otherwise, if you're supposed to get it done at the hospital where you went to the ER, call their GI clinic (gastroenterology) and see if the doctor made a referral for you to be seen there. If you still can't get anywhere then call the ER and ask them what to do. Good luck and take care! Glad to see you're following up with this!|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Call the hospital and ask for the Endoscopy lab area and see if your on the schedule. If that doesnt work, look at your discharge papers and see if the name is on the paperwork as a referral.  If still no luck call Endoscopy back and describe the doctor to them if he was a GI consult (not the ER dr).  If that doesnt work, call the main hospital and ask for help.  I wish you the best. I have had it done 2x and the day before is by far the worst part. It is, however, the best way to find where the blood was coming from and why.
wT3dGUSkaa	The Gastroenterology department will probably be calling you to schedule the test.  When they call depends on how many patients they have on their list before you.  Do you have an HMO or PPO for your insurance?  If so, call your primary care physician's office, they may be able to tell you what number to call.  Or you can try calling the insurance company themselves, they may need to give an ok for a referral.  If so, they will know where they will be sending you. Hope everything turns out OK.
Uu51cmdjaa	It's possible you have a cold, but to me it almost sounds more like allergies. If you had the flu, you'd know it. My oldest son went to work on Saturday, just to come home an hour later, sick. He said he felt a little bad when he got up Sat. morning, but thought it was nothing. After about one hour, they sent him home. He vomited, then I checked his temp. and it was over 101. After that, his symptoms were diarreah (I know, gross, sorry!) chills, sore throat, cough, etc. Long story short, the flu will give you fever. On Sunday, his temp. was 102. If you don't start to run fever, then you don't have the flu. And I know everyone is different, but generally with a cold, I and most of my family will also feel a little chilled and slight body aches. You didn't mention that you had chills or body aches, so I'd say no to flu, and prob. no to a cold. Also, the itchy eyes you mentioned also makes it sound like allergies. My advice, take your temp. just to make sure, make yourself some hot herbal tea and flavor with honey and lemon, and take some Emegen-C or try some Zicam (don't know if I spelled that right). Both work well. Also, eat all the antioxidants you can get. If you like berries, fresh blueberries are great. Whenever my kids or myself gets sick, the hot teas and berries are a must!   Get well.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	Better consult your Doctor|`|c011b76bad6ad0a0eb8d7acd8454debbaa	sounds like an alergy or the weather change, def not flu you would ache all over|`|f8QNgweaaa	No.  If you had the flu you'd feel like you are dying.
QBUypAmAaa	Who cares about the guys at school. Actually for me, if I ever do get around to being comfortable with walking around a locker room naked, I would want it to be with me looking like I have an uncut penis. I don't care if they think uncut is stupid or ugly, but to me it means the world if my penis looks intact.    I'm 21 and I've been restoring off and on for 2 years prior to now, and have started full time restoration this past December. I can only proclaim benefits since I've started, my glans is much more sensitive and more moist, and orgasm feels wonderful with the skin there to roll over at the glans and corona.   And if you're going to be living in other places around the world like me (Japan and UK here) you would look so awkward being circumcised, it's abnormal in those places. So it's your friends who think that cut is the only way to be, who are on the short end of the stick here.    It's your prerogative, if you feel strongly about it, and it sounds like you do. Go through with it, and get back some of what was taken from you. Now I'll say it's not a walk in the park, it takes many years, but you definitely won't be disappointed if you stick with it to the end. Even the smallest results reap rewards.    If you have any other questions regarding restoration or need advice or tips on it, shoot me an e-mail through my profile. I'd be glad to help a fellow restorer or even if you decide not to, I still wouldn't mind helping if you needed it.     -KH|`|TsjqzanQaa	I'm restoring my foreskin, back to as much as I can of what nature intended.      There's nothing shameful or wrong with this; the only shameful thing is the penis butchers who mutilate infants.     This is infant sexual abuse, and a violation of the basic human right to a complete and intact body.    I'm also a member of NORM, the National Organization of Restoring Men, together with some other support groups.     There are about 200,000 men restoring, as more and more guys find out that the best part of the sexual experience was stolen from them with their foreskins.    Restoring my foreskin is the best thing that I've ever done for myself.  I feel more whole, more normal, and the appearance is far better than the butchered, scarred and partial look; the hateful scar that was a constant reminder of what had been perpetrated on me.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|fnXITOVnaa	Hey man, I see no reason why you should be worried about it. For one thing... Kids in school, Im assuming youre in high school, are stupid and prey on others simply because they are different. There is no problem with wanting to restore it. As long as you're happy with it, why worry about what other people have to say? Go with what you want and everything will be perfect : ) In the big scheme of things it won't matter who likes it. If your girlfriend (or future one) happens not to like it, then she doesn't really care about you, because a good person would accept you no matter what.. And don't even worry about the kids at school. It won't matter in a few years. Good luck man : )|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Ask yourself why you want to do it. Why do you feel it is necessary to restore your foreskin. Is it out of emotional distress? Maybe you feel violated and have some resentment because of your circumcision? Understand why you want to have it done. Then weigh in the factor of being criticized. If your feelings about being circumcised out weight your fear of criticism, then I think getting it done is more important.     Its more important to be happy with who you are than it is to please others.|`|AA10350894	If you want to do it, do it. Who cares what others think, they ain't the ones who have to live with your penis, you are!  Just read up on it and learn all about it before you begin.|`|lCvJHS13aa	If they are laughing at being uncut, just consider the sources.  I will take a guess that you live in the USA?  If you were in the UK, being cut would be more abnormal.    I have gone through restoration and have never been more pleased.  The reason I started is because I felt like I was missing something, and I was right.  If you feel it's right for you, do it.  Don't worry about everyone else.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	I have been restoring my foreskin for the past two years and it is the best thing I have ever done for myself.  I think if you look into it, you will find that a lot of people are restoring,...more than you think.  There are a great many benefits to restoring.  I cannot believe what a difference it has made in my life.  There are four very informative links below that you should read.  There is no reason why anyone should find out about it.  If your friends laughed at an uncut guy, remember he is the natural one,..the way nature made him.  Your friends are the mutilated ones who have had their most nerve enervated skin hacked off at birth by some careless doctor who only is in it for money. They have no reason to laugh.  Being intact, not circumcised is the way we are made.  Nature did not give us a foreskin by accident.  It has purpose, and reason.  Read up and if you have more questions, I can help you get started.  Please feel free to write me.  Good luck.  This is one of the greatest adventures of your life.  Like all things worthwhile, remember it is also a time committment.  There is no magic pill or quick and easy way to restore your foreskin.  It will take dedication and cannot be hurried.|`|VKldHIljaa	combine what the first 2w said and you have a perfect answer|`|qD3r5sfCaa	Opinions are mixed. I have a friend who did foreskin restoration, but wished he hadn't and had to be circumcised twice. He learned a valuable lesson in being content with what he had.    I honestly can't see why you would want to do that. Uncircumcised penises are more sensitive, but to tell you the truth it doesn't make sex any better. Circumcision has a much more enveloped feeling. You're actually feeling the girl rubbing on you rather than your own skin. Circumcised penises are more sanitary, and they look more masculine. I mean come on, the foreskin makes your **** look like a taquito.    People who mourn the loss of their foreskins are silly. Would ice cream taste better if I still had my tonsils? Would your life be enriched if you never had a haircut? Who cares!? If your emotional security depends on satisfying needs you didn't have until someone said, "MY BODY IS BETTER", then you're always going to be frustrated. The grass is greener on the other side, and will be forever.     Do it if you want, but enjoy your body in the meantime. I'm glad my parents had me cut. Circumcision is awesome.

It should all be whole raw organic salads with a medley of vegetables like colored bell peppers, tomatoes, radishes, green onions, and raw fruit like citrus, pineapple, guava, mango, papaya, etc.  For protein, eat whole organic no hormones or antibiotic chicken or turkey slices.  Switch from processed standard brand breads to sprouted multi grain bread.<br>  <br>  Absolutely no processed foods for snacks.  Absolutely no white flour products.  Whole organic nuts, seeds fruits and or carbs that are whole grain or organic corn chips dipped in home made salsa (not jarred or canned).<br>  <br>  As far as junk food once a week, NO fried food!  No sweet chili sub they are loaded with enough sugar and white bread to make someone spike a normal person's insulin too high and it will make you sleepy.  <br>  <br>  Pizza is junk food! Switch to an al dente pasta with added veggies and some choice of meat. Find a recipe on google, no frozen pre prepared junk like Stofers. It is pure junk, eat real food!<br>  <br>  If you have to show up at Subway, oder a turkey or chicken sandwich with the raw veggies and no cheese. Better yet, make your own home made sandwiches and make sure the meat has no nitrates in it like the Subway sandwich meats are loaded with.  Added nitrates in processed deli meats cause brain damage and cancer so read your labels!<br>  <br>  Absolutely NO Mcdonalds french fries or fried nuggets or fried anything.  The oils are omega 6's but once you eat even a small order of Mcdonald's fries it sucks all of the Omega 3's right out of your body. If you have no omega 3's you suffer dier health issues from heart disease later in life or Alzheimers. Omega 3's cushion nerve cells and the brain cells are made out of Omega 3's which are found in flax seeds, raw fish, and grass fed organic cows meat is loaded with Omega 3's but the beef industry keeps feeding them grain and they have no Omega 3's anymore.<br>  <br>  If you have to eat anything at Mcdonald's, the packaging the food comes in is far more nutritious than the junk food they pass off as food! - A Mcdonald's fries were analyzed for nutrition compared to the cardboard box it came in and the cardboard box had more nutrition than the fries! Go to a mom and pop hamburger place and get a real burger or better yet, cook your own burger.<br>  <br>  The truth is that if anyone wants to get to their desired goal in fat loss and to stay lean for life, they cannot have junk food, cannot have smooshy white flour products or white potato products at all... no exceptions.  <br>  <br>  You can have, however, a desert once a week that you have prepared on your own, not store bought frozen cookies, but make your own and buy a great organic ice cream and treat yourself to a scoop with fresh berries.<br>  <br>  Just the way it is if you are doing all of that exercising, because the only way you can become tone is to feed your lean with proper nutrition.  You need a complete overhaul if you want to be tone.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, the foods you list are going to end up making you tired and flabby with not enough energy to keep up with exercise.<br>  <br>  Educated people make educated decisions.

If you can get Prozac through your health insurance .sure why not.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Yes, in many cases pharmaceutical solutions will help people to cope with various mental illnesses. These drugs can't be used just as a "go to" solution however, they must be paired with counseling and individual coping practices.<br>  <br>    There are many drugs out there that have proven to be extremely helpful in dealing with Nervous condidtions like anxiety. Not everything works though so see your doctor to find out what is available to you and your body type.
fkQUCwUhaa	im very sorry to hear this,  my condolences   this is what i discovered :<br>  <br>  <br>  Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to subcutaneous small arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but usually fatal. Disorders of calcium metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in dialysis patients but calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development. Methods: We studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis in our service from january 2001 to december 2006. Results: All patients were female with mean age at diagnosis 68.5 ± 6.7 years. All patients were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 patients had been receiving hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had diabetes mellitus type II and all patients were obese (BMI > 25 kg/m2). All patients had metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn′t have severe alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus < 55. All patients developed low blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment (98.3 ± 22.7/60 ± 18,29 mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions like abdomen and thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers. Conclusions: calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, without specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to develop calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In these patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis, dialysis hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia of subcutaneous adipose tissue.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.revistanefrologia.com/nlm/fichanlm.asp?id=4024" rel="nofollow">http://www.revistanefrologia.com/nlm/fic...</a>
crFPLMbsaa	you can do that with healthy eating and lots of cardio exercise    you should eat alot of protein foods like chicken, tuna, salmon, turkey  you should not eat many carbs- bread, pasta, potatoes etc    but have some carbs in the morning to kick start your metabolism (a slice of toast)    it is better for you to eat 6 small meals a day rather than 1 or 2 larger meals. if you constantly give your body small amounts of food it will constantly burn it off.    the kind of exercise you should do is aerobic exercise. ei: anything that makes your heart pump fast. (jogging,swimming laps, skipping rope etc)|`|BUCwZYnzaa	hip hop abs.  i love taht and it works. you do crunches with out doing crunches. or tae bo|`|HfQBeykkaa	go to the store and buy it !!!!!|`|AA11148143	Your desires are contradictory; abs are muscles. You can just lose fat, but that's not a six-pack, it will just be smooth.

AA10608549	You Know - that sounds like a question you should ask the Dentist (or the receptionist) about.
0rpN2419aa	I'm right there with you.  I have had insomnia for so many years along with anxiety/panic and depression.  I think the lack of sleep causes all kinds of other conditions with our health.  When I think of things I wish there was a little sleep knob on my head that I could turn off my thoughts and drift into sleep.  We need built in alarm systems for this, though...:-)  I have a notebook by bed that I write my thoughts down on, and that relaxes me a little.  I got into the prescription drugs and it was the worst mistake I made for me, maybe not for you, but I got addicted and started having terrible side effects, lack of coordination, lack of energy, blurry vision.  Sleeplessness can cause the same symptoms and it can be very difficult.|`|c3e28d1de34738af175ecd2df41d3be5aa	I also have problems with insomnia. What I've done is go to gym before and do a vigirous work out then go home and take a hot shower. By the time I have to go to bed I'm tired from the work out but relaxed by the hot shower.|`|DRSU2pz4aa	I used to have a similar problem. I think everybody goes through patches of lack-of-sleep, whether they or short or very long.    What I do (when needed) and what I did was focus on something I like thinking about right before I go to sleep, maybe have a dialogue going in my head that will distract me from anything else. I always fall asleep shortly after doing that.    I can't just say "relax" as I find that is the most useless advice somebody can give to another person, but hopefully what I suggested helped you a bit. Having gone through a year of pretty bad anxiety and depression, I know what it's like to have difficulty falling asleep. I can relate.    Once again, hope this helped.
mMGQCGMsaa	Yes.  Your GP is an idiot who isn't taking you seriously.  I have terrible pain with sex and was found to have endometriosis.  I went through THREE gyns before being diagnosed.  The first two said it was in my head, that I must have some negative views about sex, and that I needed to see a psychiatrist.  The third one did a laparoscopy and found the endo, which he lasered off.  My endo was in a place where it couldn't be detected through a routine pelvic exam, b/c with the first two doctors, they found nothing with the routine pelvic exam.  Endo also cannot be found on an ultrasound or any other type of imaging b/c it is flat lesions.  It requires a laparoscopy to detect it.  Go back to your doctor, tell her you are still having problems, and if you aren't taken seriously, go to a different doctor.  Even if you have never had problems before, endometriosis can strike at different ages.  It could also be something like an ovarian cyst.|`|fHEt1Xj6aa	you could have pulled a muscle or strained alot lately|`|DtG4zpM2aa	You should go back to your GP, and if she doesn't seem to be taking things seriously, ask to see someone else.  You may need referred to gynaecology for further tests.  There's a number of possible causes of pain like this including infections and endometriosis (a condition where tissue like the lining of the uterus is present in places where it shouldn't normally be, such as the ovaries).|`|8NqQvOqQaa	that's really strange  that can't be normal  i dont know why your GP isn't prescribing you with something.  you should re-visit your GP and say that your not pregnant and that the pain is still occurring because this pain could be something serious.|`|hkSJSW55aa	i had this same prob a couple of months back. i went to the ER and they did a ultrasound. i found out i had a ovarian cyst on my right ovary. You should try and find someone else to check u. hope this helps. =D|`|NB1cbRm0aa	i've experienced that before, but for me it would go away naturally in a few days. I haven't had that problem for a while now.    For me it seems to be normal since it goes away, I don't know about you depending on how long it has been going on...  could just be a muscle problem...    Anyway, go back to your GP telling her you did what she told you to do, and that it did not solve the problem. Then she should suggest something else, or do something! It sucks for sex to hurt.|`|xl6936Ifaa	no
0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	Yes that's normal. You won't bleed again until you stop taking them.

Many of these diets are difficult and can be very challenging to follow. They have austere rules and complicated dietary schedules. Do you think that these detoxification diets are worth the effort? Do they really work?<br>  <br>  In Asian medicine, detoxification is a fact of life. In fact, all disease and illness is thought to stem from toxins in the body that disrupt your body's natural life flow. Naturally toxins are eliminated within hours of consumptions. But the human liver is not so efficient when it's constantly bombarded by harsh toxins.<br>  <br>  So what's the proof that detoxifying your body actually works?<br>  <br>  If you take blood test before and after a detox, you will actually see that pH changes in your blood. Before you detox your body, your blood would be more acidic but after detoxification, your blood will change back to its healthy state which is slightly alkaline.<br>  <br>  There are many real life testimonials and accounts that high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, and even diabetes can be reduced or even cured by detoxification. Diabetics can maintain their proper insulin levels after a detox diet (must be under the supervision of the medical doctor). People with high blood pressure have better control over their blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Much of the effects of detoxification depend largely on the detox program or diet you choose. Certain factors such as suitability, your body, the intensity of the detox diet, would really determine whether a detox diet really works. It would be up to your own judgment and doctor's advice to help you detox effectively and safely.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes absolutely, great idea, I've done it many times. 8 weeks per year keeps me detoxed enough to eat what I like for most of the year.<br>  <br>  I only ever do it using diet, and never buy products because they are expensive, too harsh and completely unnecessary. It's called the liver cleansing diet and has been worked up and perfectly balanced by a doctor, Sandra Cabot.<br>  <br>  This diet needs you to eliminate all red meat, animal fats, dairy, all processed food and anything containing additives. Replace it with fish/seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables (raw is better) and fruit, wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. Drink lots of water to help flush out all the toxins. Raw vegie juices in the mornings are also great for cleansing.<br>  <br>  If you can do this without cheating you will lose 1-2 kg every week no problem. This works every time for me, and each time gets easier since there is less to get rid of. It's a nice diet and you don't have to starve. Exercise is important too, at least 30min a day.<br>  <br>  Read the articles I have added below, they will explain further and offer you an example diet plan and tips to organise yourself. Hope you like it. Best of luck.
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|a9btWYKRaa	Crunches are very good for toning your tum, Just be consistent and work hard. Don't give up when it starts to get tough you should work through it, This is when you are actually working your muscles to improve.|`|oz2mOkmyaa	I would suggest turbulence training. it combines strength training(for building lean muscle tissue) and cardio(for fat burning). you don't need any fancy equipment or an expensive gym membership. <br>  <br>  example: squats, push-ups, pull-ups, mountain climbers(if you can't do a push-up or pull-up=> use dumbbells or resistance bands & do a pushing exercise and a pulling exercise instead). do 15 reps of each back to back to back to back without resting. that equals 1 set. rest 30-60 secs. repeat. do 3-5 complete sets. Do this 3-4x/week.<br>  <br>  If you noticed there are no sit-ups or crunches in this workout. the best way to burn fat and tighten up your midsection & core is through total body exercises!<br>  <br>  These workouts are great for women or men!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|hPDMDrTqaa	Do lots of Crunches and Leg Lifts.<br>  Also theres lots of other things you can do on this site.<br>  <a href="http://www.the-fitness-motivator.com/ab-exercises.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.the-fitness-motivator.com/ab-...</a><br>  <br>  For explainations on Leg Lifts and Crunches:<br>  <br>  Leg Lifts<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Leg-Lifts" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Leg-Lifts</a><br>  <br>  Crunches<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Crunches" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Crunches</a>
aOmDuXubaa	Inversion therapy will work better for spinal alignment and back pain.  Inversion therapy uses the effects of gravity to weight down your spine and stretch it out.  As this happens your spine is allowed to decompress and as that happens it relieves the pinched nerves in your spine.  Inversion therapy causes your muscles of your core (the hips, thighs, buttocks, back muscles and most importantly the stomach muscles) to stretch out.  As they stretch the knots and spasms leave and when these muscles are all relaxed they loosen their grip on your lower back muscles, your spine and most importantly your pelvis, allowing them to go back into natural alignment.  As they align this will cause your sciatica to vanish.  It's like if your car is out of alignment it pulls to one side and screws up the tires, it's the same with your back.  Inversion therapy will help align your spine much quicker than some pillow while you're laying on your back.  Hope this helps.
9huxAcK9aa	Wow That's cool!  Anyhow, I would still exercise, maybe half the time you are supposed to work out.  Like you should normally workout 30-60 minutes, but you could decrease to 15-30 minutes.  Like if you take gym class or whatever, you don't have to worry about exercise at all.    That's really cool!  Hope this helped!  ~Summer|`|PK9R1V8gaa	it's probably the ones you burn doing nothing, since all you do at shool is basicaly sit around and learn.

IU2Znlv3aa	I've recently quit, and when the cravings get really bad i find something to chew on like a straw or chewing gum, it sort of helps with the oral fixation part of it.  It also helped me to tell my flatmates that i'm quitting so if i mention really needing one they can keep me busy.  Also if you have any cigarettes left over, give them to someone you live with or hide them away somewhere, so they aren't easy to get one but if you feel like you really really need one, it takes you a while to find them, and by that time you might have changed your mind. Also it helps me to know that i have them around, as it stops me thinking about how soon i can go and buy some.  If you do have one (i lasted 3 weeks before slipping up) it's not the end of the world, just write it off as a mistake, don't think you've ruined it.  It sounds really cliche but keep yourself busy, i find when im in the middle of something i don't really think about cigarettes. Also write down the date since you had one. I have it above my desk and it helps remind me that i'm doing a good job and how hard it would be to stay cigarette free for this long again if i give up and have one.  If you need some kind of nicotine replacement, then the nicorette inhalators are really good because they help keep your hands busy as well as providing you with nicotine and I've seen those electric cigarettes that danielle r mentioned, and i've always wanted to get them, but they cost like 50.  The gum works ok, if you prefer that, but i'm not crazy about the flavour of it. If you get the nicotine patch, make sure you get one with the right amount of nicotine as if you get one that's too strong it can make you feel really sh1t.  Good luck with quitting, i hope it works for you this time!    Just realised how long this essay is! Sorry!|`|66sYIR7Faa	i saw this cool thing in a magazine one day, it was a battery powered cigarette that only had the nicotine and not all the harmful chemicals|`|8e7e2fd391e28bb3b4818c8a3c3bee59aa	I take it that means you try nicotine replacement before and it hasn't work.

My sister stopped for her kid, and she said it really wasn't that hard after a while.|`|xb9ellaIaa	chew chewingum alot, use nicoret patches. keep ur handz buzy wid a pen or something. if u r a heavy smoker then u cannot just quit at once. keep a record of how much u smoke per day then reduce it day by day and then totally finish it|`|c4mAxz4iaa	Use meditation  Chew lots of gum and suck on candy  Make yourself donate money to charity every time you smoke  Make signs at your house everywhere that say no smoking  get support from friends  TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GBG2hbQ4aa	I don't live back east, so have no clue what is available there.  If you are inclined to do some research regarding your daughter's illness,  look into orthomolecular psychiatry.  Dr. Abrahm Hoffer is the father of orthomolecual psychiatry, and while he is quite old and retired now, his work continues.  He has several books out...I found most of them at Amazon.com.    He claims a high rate of recovery for patients with schizophrenia, using nutritional interventions.  Very unlike our American approach of using pharmaceuticals that have a very mixed success rate coupled with some very difficult side effects.  I haven't researched him on schizo-effective disorder, but you can give it a try.
31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	YOu can take care of most of that with good well balanced meals and vitamins.  The low blood sugar is the reason that you are tired - in my opinion.  that number should be more than 75 at the least.  However, you may have a low blood sugar for a variety of reasons.  If your doctor did not discuss the low blood sugar with you, I would ask him point blank.  That is called HYPOGLYCEMIA and can be dangerous if it continues.
GemKKO8Saa	Yes, you might be getting ready to start your period soon. Don't use tampons at first. Try tampons on your second or third period or later than that. There is a paper that should come in the box that will tell how to put in a tampon. If you still don't really know how then, ask your mom or close female adult.|`|nJTIkwSfaa	Sounds like you should have it very soon, i would get sore breasts and be grumpy about a week before mine, with regards to the tampons you are best to read the instructions, it will give you a step by step guide|`|dALX1qQdaa	yeah! just be ready for it, have a pad or tampon in your locker etc. there is no way to tell what date and time you will get it.    when you first start using tampons, buy the slender tampons.     http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/azhealt...|`|pMU6t89Faa	yea. i think ur starting i soon. probly like a week or two. idk how to use a tampon. i dont trust myself enough to stick something in me|`|QKGuNLb4aa	well if your urine smells you could have a uti but the discharge could be because you are ovulating which means that yes you will start your period soon. you usually have your period about two weeks after you ovulate.     i would seriously recommend that you try pads at first but if you are dead set on tampons then what you do is stand with your knees bent slightly put your middle finger and thumb on the applicator and then insert the tampon. push it until your finger and thumb are touching your vagina and then use your index finger to push the tampon out of the applicator..      good luck to ya|`|kUXelHWIaa	The stuff that you see in your underwear that is white is called C-U-M. i had to spell it out or it has little stars. But this is a little sign that you will be starting soon. Before i started my period i felt like i peed my pants to. i went to the bathroom and there was that *** in my underwear. you have no sign that you will be starting your period except cramps. thats a pain underneath your stomach near your pant line.     To insert a tampon there is instructions on the box, ***Playtex tampons are the best*** But if you wanna know now you can spread your legs when you are on the toliet knees at least 1 and a half feet apart.or you can lean against something and put on leg up high. and insert it going towards your back.    Hope i helped!!|`|z2UyScjVaa	the white stuff indicates u will start soon:)|`|5vFUYtdEaa	Ya, you are probably getting your period! it's natural, don't be embarressed! every woman in the entire world has had it in their life! and the "whitish stuff" is dicharge. it's normal! so dont worry if its heavy where a panty liner!    As for the tampon...if you get the box of tampons (perferably, tampax genal glide) the instructions are right there on the instruction paper in the box! and trust me you want to start with tampons! pads feel like dipers!|`|lZwWcMmBaa	ok the whole witeish stuff is called discharge the bitchy attituide is just your emotions and if someone says you were mean to them tell them its your fave time of the month and your sorry  The hole tampon thing put a mirror in between your legs and look into it try finding a hole and insert the tampons in.\\\Good Luck      Oh almost forgot your breasts, they feel heaver because they are, Your breasts are probably very tender and the only reason is your nipple is growing and gaining more nevers The nipple is the most sesitive part of the Female Private selection of gifts (i mean out of the nipple vag. and the breasts)

pMzq6B3paa	Talk to a lawyer, maybe you can sue.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You need to find out if you can qualify for state ins or fed ins plans *welfare type* to help you out with this. Im sorry you must not be feeling very well right now. At the hosipital did they offer to help you fill out paper to get this done? If not, call the hospital up and talk to the receptionist and see if she can help you, usually its easy to do at the hospital but you may of paid in cash and didnt get offfered (US only).  As funny as it sounds, it costs alot of money to sue people, you have to pay a lawyer, and then the filing costs etc.  Since there was no dangerous things going on other than the ice, you might possibly win a small amount, but then again youll have to get someone to serve them to get them to pay, its a lengthy process. Anyhow try to get on a program to help if you qualify for low income. I hope you are ok and feel better soon.|`|wSq80V1xaa	You can't sue them for having ice on their property.

fk9AvB25aa	Some can tell and some can't, if they can't tell then they should test, even if they are not 100 percent sure. I would never rely on just a visual when it comes to things like that. If it's a mild out break herpes can look like a pimply rash and you wouldn't have all of the classic symptoms, there could be just some bad aches or burning down there.  You should know that herpes can be passed on even if condoms are used. They only protect the shaft of the penis and genital herpes can affect all areas of the genitals, not just the shaft.   The swab culture is accurate so I would trust the results of that over a blood test or a visual exam. That is how I was diagnosed. I don't think I have heard of eczema happening on the genitals before but I supposed it's possible.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Well, now that you mentioned you have eczema, it could be just that. You should've informed your doctor about that because then he/she would have been able to rule the herpes out at least in theory, although they still would have to follow procedure and take samples for the lab in order to be sure.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	I hate to answer this question the wrong way, but it really does sound like you have genital herpes.  Gyno's know what they are looking for, and probably wouldn't have done the swab if they weren't certain it was herpes.  The symptoms seem to be that of Herpes - small bumps and pain in the groin.  Of course, the true diagnosis will be when the test comes back from the lab.  I know this is not what you want to hear, but either way, you will be fine.  Over 25% of Americans live with genital herpes, and have very meaningful and successful lives.  You will not be defined by your herpes, if that's what it turns out to be.  My best to you.|`|0aDTFQOdaa	80% sure.  and I know there are online std testing site.   maybe you can take a pic of your vagina and sent it to the std counselor at the std social site called pozcupid,  they will check that for you.|`|9GE7um9Jaa	I had herpes, I caught it from a coldsore which is the herpes virus, if ypu have been given oral sex by someone with a coldsore then it could be herpes, however you said they weren't irritable? Herpes hurts like hell and it is very itchy and painful and when you pass urine it BURNS. It sounds to me a lot more like genital warts, warts are exactly like what you described, red little bumps that dont hurt. Just go to your nearest sexual health clinic and they will tell you how to treat your problem if you have one, whatever happens they will tell you what the real problem is, doctors dont deal with the sexual side of illnesses, they can but prefer not to and are not very skilled so DEFINATLEY go to your nearest sexual health clinic - they are normally found in hospitals. GOOD LUCK : )

80Qa796baa	Well...  I'm 18.. 19 in 2 weeks  I've been drinking vodka since I was about 14..  As most teenagers do.  But I drank it a lot more than anyone else.. and actually developed a drinking problem from it.. which I couldn't get my head around because of my age..   Anywaaaay  I am now left with a stomach ulcer which 4 doctors and a specialist have proven was caused by drinking so much vodka  To some people a stomach ulcer may not sound like a big deal but it's actually very life threatening.  I've been on medication and sober for ages but I still cannot get rid of it and it is getting worse..  From keeling over in pain.. to fainting.. throwing up blood.. and causing panic attacks. If I doesn't start to heal soon it will eventually kill me.. and If I started drinking again I would literally die within months...  And an ulcer is only one of the small illnesses caused by drinking.. so I don't wanna even imagine what others are like..   So yeah... tell your friend.. it's not worth it.. and moderation is better than living in pain everyday.    Jaz x|`|XM59p7uQaa	Simple answer is his liver will pack up and will die  if he carries on drinking.|`|HKQHicZ1aa	An MD told me if you are going to drink, Vodka is your best alcohol since it is the most pure,ie, least toxic on your body.  But you need or must drink for your own health just one or two drinks a night more than 1 hour apart.  Key to a healthy and happier life is to structure your time by replacing the time you spend drinking with more positive activities: go exercise, no more time spent at the club or bar, take a fun class, coach some younger kids, volunteer, don't restructure your time into getting richer... reduce your stress instead.  Now if you are a heavy drinker and have structured your life around the bar/club scene:  Your program is to replace the drinking activities with non-drinking activities ASAP, plus no drinking for the next 10(ten) years.  If all goes well, you can then start drinking moderately for the rest of your life.  Like me though, once you get on a more positive path, you will no longer want to structure you life around booze at all.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Liver and kidney damage, brain damage, depression, heart failure, obesity, prostate damage and incontinence, impotence.

9cwM6S6Jaa	Did you just recently have it put in? I'd be curious to know how long you have had your IUD. I've had one for 5 years. For the first 3 days, I bled alot and had extreme cramping. For the first few months, I had irregular periods. By the end of the first year, I no longer had periods at all.     I sometimes experience "twitching" in my lower pelvis region too. Obviously in my case, I'm not pregnant. I think the "twitching" is just the muscles fluttering or slightly contracting around the IUD. It's not painful at all, not for me anyway, but it's noticeable. Your tissue grows around it as time goes on, so not anything serious.     The period situation can vary woman to woman, but usually you tend to lose your periods after awhile. Hard to say with you since you didn't state how long you've had it.     Just follow up with your doc as a precaution though. Good luck!

d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	It makes you ask questions like this?|`|CBfGXLvKaa	How do you smoke a liquid..? If there is a way to I would say it would be very dangerous!|`|SrmR5iNxaa	I am assuming you would put the alcohol on the paper and let it dry then smoke it.     Ummm yeah don't do that I don't think it would do good things to you.|`|ovCdqzFFaa	Your an idiot.  You cant smoke alcohol >=0  What are you on?!|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Well first off alcohol poisoning is far more likely to occur when you inhale alcohol. This is because when you drink alcohol it's absorbed over time, through the lining of your stomach and small intestine, but when you inhale alcohol it goes straight into your blood stream, via the lungs. Because of this they don't want recommend more than two shots and this could get you as really drunk, really fast. In fact it takes 20 minutes to inhale the alcohol using the devices meant for this to specifically counteract this effect. If you're using dry ice, there are no safeguards in place (including your stomach decision to vomit to get rid of some of the alcohol) and if you do too much you're just screwed. It's also more addictive than regular alcohol because like with mostly all inhalants, it effects your brain more than liquid. In fact when they want to get animals addicted to alcohol in lab studies, they vaporize the alcohol because its way more addictive (usually only taking a couple days) and easier to get the animals to use. In layman's terms, you're better off just knocking back a couple of beers doing shots of hard liquor than inhaling it. Read this article to learn more.

uVmwUqhIaa	Bleeding from gauging is normal. You are indeed stretching skin, and sometimes the stretch can be more of a tear. Did you get your ears pierced as an 8 gauge? If so, you should leave the gauges in for about a month or so. If you recently gauged to an 8, it may be a good idea to wait another two weeks, just to allow the skin to accommodate. When gauging, it doesn't hurt to clean your ears as though you just got them pierced, especially if your piercings bleed in the process. This will help prevent infection.  It would also be a good idea to use Bactine. This is an antiseptic, but it can also act as a lubricant when gauging your ears, making the transition a little less painful.    Good luck!

lavd3UHmaa	Running burns more calories than walking, but is a lot harder on your body.  I included a link of someone who gets really technical about the calories burned if your interested.http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read...|`|PK9R1V8gaa	nope, but some cardio exercises like tennis and running are especially good for you because you get toned along with losing all those calories.|`|XscVe0AYaa	Nothing, other than that more intense workouts will work your cardiovascular system more.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	no at all there is no different whatever your workout the result is the same it always depend on the duration of the workout and accuracy you make it by the way if you know that one step forward will make you burn 2 calories so how many you can make walking to work .|`|gERaZGZeaa	Yes, the more intense your workout, the more it raises your V02 max - "Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is widely accepted as the single best measure of cardiovascular fitness and maximal aerobic power"  Also, the more intense cardio works your heart, controlling blood pressure, and give you a lower resting BPM.    Cardio isn't to burn fat, it's to work your cardiovascular system.  Burning fat is just a side effect of that.    Edit: These people don't know what they're talking about.  There are a LOT more differences than just the amount you work out for.  Sheesh!|`|sq4BcGbIaa	Theres no difference between how you achieve it.    If you burn calories you burn calories, no exercise "tones" certain areas more than others - complete myth.

Put it out of your head.  Yes, you will be thinner, but you wont look good.  You will look terrible because your health will be falling apart and once your body runs out of fat to consume, it will start eating away at your muscles.  It doesnt sound pretty because its not.    Focus on eating less bread and pasta (unless it is whole wheat).  Eat less potatoes, and if you eat rice, try to eat brown rice instead of white.    No fried foods, no candy, sodas, etc.  Eat more fruits, vegetables, and lean meats.  Avoid milk but do eat yogurt cause you still need calcium.        Can you join any sports at school?  That would be a good way to burn fat and tone your body--it really doesnt matter what sport you pick.  If your school doesnt really have sports yet, see if your parents will buy you a Pilates workout DVD to use at home.  If you dont know what Pilates is, it is a type of exercise that tones your body without making you bulky, and you really dont need much equipment if any to do it.  My sister lost a lot of weight at 14 and she used home workout videos for exercise.    Just never forget to put your health first, and thinness will follow.

But probably not the best choice in your case, I've had insomnia to but there are plenty of non-addictive medicines out there now. You should try some of those first, and if those don't work then try consulting a doctor or therapist about the issue.
MPX0f5jzaa	If all you're doing is running and watching your diet, why would you have muscles?  You're doing this to yourself by not weight training.  That takes practice.  While you're busy criticizing people for being "douchebags" just because they work for their bodies, you're losing out on girls w/ your negativity.    Start over.  It's not all about running, all you're doing is burning more calories than you're taking in.  Too skinny.  Start lifting lightly at first and build as you go.  For God's sake eat some protein.    Genetics has nothing to do w/ it, nor does your family's lifestyle, it's all about you.  Don't make excuses, just brush up on your attitude and go back to work, you'll be a douchebag in no time.  LOL j/k    BTW, there's no such thing as not having "abs".  I think you're trying to say you don't have a six-pack.  Abdominals are muscles, you're not born without them.|`|apXIw0ZJaa	Because that is the way God designed you! :-) Don't worry about having all the girls...because right now that may seem great...but someday the perfect girl will come along for you! And you will be so glad you didn't waste your time with girls who have 12 boyfriends in a month. When you find Mrs.Right she will love you for you! Not what body type you have! And you will be suprised...there is prob. a girl out there who is dying to meet you and talk to you but you don't even know. Good Luck...hopefully oon you will accept you for you! I'll be praying for you!|`|1wFMGizXaa	You're not targeting the parts of your body that you want to improve. Buy some 10-pound weights and start lifting every day before school. Do sit-ups after school. Eventually, you'll see progress.    Every person builds muscle differently. Some of those muscle men in your school can't run as well as you can. And you don't build stomach and arm muscles as easily as other guys. That's okay. If you start actually working on your 'weak spots,' you WILL see muscles.     I've been lifting pathetic little 5-pound weights for about two weeks now and even I'm seeing improvement.|`|n9sRwB1naa	I don't know the answer to your genetics problem, but I can tell you that not all girls prefer muscle heads. When I was in high school I went for the mid range body type. Did you ever consider that you're just looking for the wrong girls? OPen your eyes a little more and you'll see that there are lots of cute nice girls that aren't that shallow. Or would you rather be with someone like that? One other thing...maybe you're being way too hard on yourself. Stop comparing yourself to the jocks so much and be proud that you can run all over the darn city and not puke (cross country). That's cool. I bet most of the football players wouldn't make it after a mile or two.|`|YL1NQ8ntaa	As a life-time jogger I say keep up the cross country. However, I will to gamble that you are missing a restful nights sleep. This may not come easy. You need to discover how long that is for you, you may have to change you environment. I must have not lights on at all. Sometimes soft background music helps. I have also found a health supplement that helps me. I sleep between 5 to 6 hours, more and I am groggy.     Visit my blog site, I wrote an article about restful sleep.     Best Wishes
GIkyDUulaa	Sometimes it feels like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders, and it would be easier to just sink than fight back.  Believe me, I know what you are going through, I battled with depression through high school.    You just have to count on things getting better, and they will.  It might take awhile, but life is never as bad as it seems.  Count on the good in your life, and focus on that.  You may call yourself a 'loser', but if you start to believe in yourself more and feel comfortable with who you are, your self-image will improve.  Be friendly, put yourself out there, make more friends you care about.    You might be doing poorly in school because you don't care anymore.  You might be surprised, but applying yourself might pay off, and you might feel better about yourself if you are rewarded with a good grade.  As for your sexual confusion, gay, straight, bi, whatever, people will accept you.  Some may not, but many are just like you and will support you.  You need to know you are not alone in your feelings.   As for your mom, just support her, let her know you care.  Believe me, if you turn around just small aspects of your life and love yourself, you will be rewarded.  Please never follow through with taking your life.  Your mother, however she may be, and other people love you, and will be hurt by that decision.  Your life is worthy, and you are strong enough to fight back.  It may seem so hard right now, but things will get better.  Believe that.    That all I had 5 years ago...faith.  And now, looking back, I am so happy I never took my own life, because now I see that it is worthy.    I hope that 5 or 10 years or even 6 months from now you can see that too.      youre strong enough to fight.  please try.    you can email me at any time herestogoodbye1@aol.com  (anytime you feel like you want to end it, I will always be willing to talk, youre not alone)|`|gainQWRsaa	I'm having a similar issue, and can't believe that I'm giving advice, but I am. Lately I have been thinking of suicide, but I can't kill myself. I'm not afraid of going to Hell or anything, as I don't believe in a higher power. Just don't kill yourself. I have managed and get this, my "dad" tried to KILL my mom, he wants to kill me and I haven't gone outside in 6 months because he is still in my neighborhood. I had a break down at school and now people avoid me and think I'm crazy. I might move to another country, I don't know, because I am unsure of everything. I fight depression everyday and do my best to work through it. If your gay thats fine. Who cares, and actually, I like talking to gay and bi kids more than straight kids. You are who you are. I still have a few good friends, and I don't have a boyfriend, which is fine. As for stopping you, you just have to decide to fight to live. Just because your a guy doesn't mean you can't cry, and crying helps. And lately my grades aren't so hot either, and thats fine too. Your going through a difficult time. Find a good friend to talk to or join a chat group online that deals with problems like your. Best of luck, and just keep holding on, and if it matters, I will do my best to fight to survive if you do!|`|02ad26187bfacf59127c844619d98752aa	http://www.kidshelpphone.com     they have helped me through so many things..   there are so many answers up there.. its pointless for me to repeat them all like i would    but if you ever think you need to talk right now.. and you think there is no one..   call them. its free and no one knows its you nor will it show up on the phone bill.     they are kind, and dont mind talking with you..   reach out.|`|ntIm2G5xaa	Hi Myles!  I'm so sorry for everything you have to deal with!  I know having suicidal thoughts can be rough (I have them all the time too), but maybe thinking of something, just one thing, you want to live for could help.  I know there have been times where I really thought I'd do it, but I also came up with a backup plan (for example mine involves school, if I don't make it into my dream college and have to go to one I hate I'm going to become a doctor instead of what I actually have planned on being, it may sound bizarre but it actually helps I've found).  Also, about a month ago I watched "It's A Wonderful Life" (old movie, but it's really good) and it was strangely helpful (it's about this man who contemplates suicide and this angel who helps him, but it's way better than just that).  I think it can show you what kind of influence you have on people's lives, even if you don't realize it. I know it's hard to believe sometimes, and I never believe people when they tell me, but I know it's still true.  You're a wonderful person you deserve to have a great life.  I know it's going to come to you.    Also, at school, you're cooler than the other people anyways.  However, if you want to expand your circle of friends maybe partner up with someone different in class (labs or group assignments).  I'm sure anyone would love to have you in their group.  No worries about them judging you base on your friends you already have either.  I know at my school people take each person as they are and forget about what group they belong to, so people will be looking at you for you.  People can always use more friends and you' d make an excellent one.  They'll see that just by talking to you.  At assemblies you could even sit by someone you aren't usually next to as well, and talk while everyone is getting settled.  Even if it doesn't seem it, I know your classmates would love to get to know you.  They're just unsure of the best way to show it right now, but soon they'll see.  Before you know it they will all know your awesome personality.    For the grades you could try going in for help at lunch time or after school.  Teachers love to see initiative.  You sound very smart, so please don't think these grades in any way reflect your level of intelligence.  You could even ask someone in your grade to help you out and that way you'd combine a new friend with higher grades.  Believe me, people will be flattered to be viewed as smart and helpful, as well as seen as your friend.  Before homeroom you could just approach someone you think looks nice and say, "Hey, that homework in *teacher's name* class was kind of hard, did you get it?  Mind helping me out?"  Anyone would be lucky to assist you. Everyone understands that not all homework is quick and simple.  It's great to bond over a tricky assignment.    Being gay is nothing to be ashamed of either : ).  You're perfect how you are.  I'm sure people won't think it's a big deal.  People are really very accepting of that.  I know some people who are gay and they're so nice no one cared at all when they found out.  If you're not ready to tell anyone yet you can keep it to yourself until you are, but please don't feel like you nee to be ashamed.  Maybe you could join a support group online, there are lots of teenagers going through this now as well.  You're wonderful how you are.      I'm really sorry about your mom doing pot.  I know how surprised I was when I found out my siblings did, but a parent is way rougher.  Do you have an aunt or an uncle you could tell?  Otherwise, could you tell the guidance counselor at school, or try talking to your mom (even together with the counselor)?  It's really important that you're safe and taken care of, you shouldn't have the added responsibility and worry of a parent who's not acting how they should.  Your mom loves you, but you deserve to not have to worry about her drug problem, so she needs to get over this for you.  This has a lot of help lines: http://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/ThisMorning... .  This has some information: http://www.fight-drug-addiction.com/chil... .  And I just saw that www.kidshelpphone.com has been posted already, so I agree with sourcherry119 posting that that's a good one to use.     It's always good to go to someone, including here, when you feel like you've reached the end of the line.  I definitely find it so helpful to get it out.  If you ever want to talk I'm here.  Please know that you are so amazing just how you are.  I know that life will work out and one day you really will be glad to be alive (it's so hard to see at times, and some days can be better than others, but it's true : ) ).  Just so you know, I would consider myself really blessed to have you as a friend.  I believe in you and I know you can get through this time in your life.      Sorry it's long, I hope you don't mind reading it.  The main thing is that you're a great person!    Also, if you feel you have a friend you like and trust maybe you'd like to reach out to them as well (not just now, but anytime you feel like you really can't live any longer; someone you could call and talk to).  I'm sure he or she would be very understanding.  This is tough to go through and you shouldn't have to go through it alone.  Again, I'm always here if you want to talk.|`|YAwvszITaa	Please know that whatever your problems and issues are suicide is not the answer. It is never so bad that that will be the only option. I know what it is like to feel like life is shi77y but killing yourself is not what you need. You should speak with a counselor and get help. You are worthy of living that is what you are here for. No matter what has happened you have got to stop judging yourself in such negative ways. I suggest you go to your mom too and don't be afraid to admit you need help. The sooner you do talk to someone the better because then you will get help quicker. If you don't like your grades study harder. I know this world is overwhelming but don't let it knock you down. If you are gay then that is something you have to LIVE with. Praying does help when you feel like you are the only one with your back against the wall. But please get help and fast so that you can get better and go on with a happy productive life with a stable future.http://www.suicidehotlines.com/ Please visit this site and they have resources and numbers for you to call someone there is bound to be able to help you sweetie don't give up.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	You are young yet and should not have such thoughts.

Hope this will help. all the best! =)|`|9Q1muFGXaa	You should go to your local mental health institution for counseling. It helps to talk to someone about your problems that can help with your problems. You could get a part time job and do activities that you may like to make new friends. A job will help you feel you have a purpose not only in school. You could even do volunteer work as well which is always a good feeling to have. You are young and you need to adventure out a bit more to find out who you are as a person. Talk to your mom about the pot. Try to get her help to if you can. Also focus more in school and work on getting your grades up. That will make you feel acomplished for completed a goal you set on better grades. As for maybe being gay well I wouldnt know how to find out if you were or not, but I guess just wait and see what happens on that subject. I'm sure there will be signs for you to help you find your sexuality and understand it in the future. True friends and loved ones are not going to care if your gay. Just be open about who you are and be happy with it. I'm a woman and been married for 5 yrs and sometimes think about girls.LOL. I don't know what makes you think you maybe gay but its normal to have thoughts of the same sex, your young. your mind may just be curious and there is nothing wrong with that. Try to get your mom to do family counseling if necessary to, that may help you both. Good luck with everything and I hope you can find the path that is best for you as a person.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	obviously you dont wanna commit suicide or you would have done it already instead of coming on here and complaining to a bunch of strangers. what you need is attention! get a job join some kinda after school activity and p.s. who cares if your gay everyone is gay now!!! lol|`|Yr5zBsIHaa	you can always pray! that helps the most!

aCJWXkmFaa	yes it is possible. i would check that out with a doctor immediatley
E64juLwJaa	That is because of the scar tissue :made the exit narrower.  Go see your Dr:this is no good .  Can lead to infections.  Soak in warm water and try to remove smegma before seeing the Dr.  Use a q-tip if you cannot retract at all.  Success:Planets.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Circumcision is NEVER necessary or desirable.    Don't listen to those advising it, and don't let some doctor talk you into this unnecessary mutilation; there are other solutions.    First you can try gradual and gentle stretching, so as not to cause additional scar tissue.     This will take several months to accomplish.  Don't try to rush it and don't try to do it so hard as to cause a lot of pain and discomfort.    Should this not succeed, there's always a preputioplasty, or dorsal slit.      Most doctors won't even offer it, as they are more intent on mutilating guys by circumcision, frequently they're members of the religions that try to perpetrate circumcision on all males.  They're biased, to say the least.    You're lucky to have a foreskin, as it is what makes your penis complete, and you will have 100% sexual sensitivity and enjoyment with a complete penis, others weren't so lucky.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|0x4MpgCNaa	yo man doesnt bein uncircumsized suck =[  haha nto realy actualy its not too bad but al my friends make fun of me for it even though my penis is bigger than theirs for sure mines 8 inch and im 13    but either get circumsized or go to a doctor    scratch that  go to a doctor 1st|`|DXJ6Ws8oaa	you should really see a doctor for this. trying to pull it back after you tore it and if its not healed could be dangerous|`|ONRpcM82aa	Try to pull it back every day and to stretch it a little at a time.  It might hurt a little but after a while it will loosen.  Its important that you do something because you want to be able to clean it.  Even when the skin tear, make sure you pull it back a few times a day so it will not tighten back up when it heals.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	As E.W. put it, circumcision is never necessary.  Follow the stretches in the three attached links and you will be able to re-stretch your foreskin so it will retract properly.  Just be careful you do not overstretch.  This causes micro tears (Like the one that caused this problem) in the end of the skin and these heal over with non elastic scar tissue.  You can also go to the doctor and ask for steroid cream that will help to relax and stretch your foreskin.  This could be a second alternative.  Do not ever let them hint at circumcision.  Be very firm and tell them it is not an option.  Good luck with this|`|1EOf9DbQaa	that is why they circumsize you when you are born . the forskin will get infected and cause yeast to grow. you need to get circumsized.|`|VKldHIljaa	bad if it starts to smell and theres no real way to fix that if its gotten to a sertain point....it is possible in some cases but in others its just to hard...probable solution is you need to get circumcised    but bad smell is bad possible infection or fungus.....|`|AA10251905	see your doctor.

That will give you the energy you need to work-out plus take away cravings.    Good Luck|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|biknsMtGaa	It would be very depends on a different factors. Its better if you read some testimonials from the customers before you buy.

3UQrUNMSaa	Slim Fast is mainly a group of shakes that has branched out into making meal bars; pasta, and an assortment of soups. The basis of the Slim Fast diet plan is using portion control and exercise along with sensible eating. With this diet you are encouraged to eat six smaller meals and snacks spread out throughout the day rather than three meals, as well as some moderate exercise daily. Every day you are supposed to use Slim Fast products for two meals and one snack each day. The rest of the meals and snacks are up to you. Although this diet doesn't tell you what not to eat or use in your meals, fruits, vegetables and lean proteins are advised.    While on the Slim Fast diet people usually lose about 10% of their body weight in the first six months. What's more about this diet is that it is a safe long-term solution to dieting, from one or two to even five years. The website has forums for support, 'Ask the Dietitian,' and other useful information. Many doctors like this diet because it has everything in it to encourage weight loss. Healthy meals; exercise, it doesn't leave you feeling hungry and it has many support pillars for its users. One of the best things about this diet plan is that when it comes to the shakes use to replace those two meals; they are perfectly balanced and measured out so that you're not missing out on any nutrients by substituting them.    So there you have it, a review of the Slim Fast diet plan. Now to answer the burning question, does Slim Fast really work? Absolutely, it's a safe and effective way to lose weight and keep it off for the long-term. Just follow the plan, do the exercise and use the online support and other resources that are there for you and you should have no problem realizing your weight loss goals.    Although the slim fast plan can be effective the main complaint would be if someone doesn't like the taste of the drinks and the plan isn't exactly something that teaches you long term healthy eating principles. If you need an actual diet that teaches you EXACTLY what and when to eat you may want to look elsewhere.

I would not due heat because if you have any bacteria in the wound it will cause them to multiply faster and increases chance of infections. ICE only.|`|u5isTA8waa	Aren't you supposed to stay in the hospital after a surgery?|`|a8UX1tHLaa	Don't use heat, you could get an infection. Use ice..

Jswomud7aa	Most likely, yes, you will need a root canal according to what you described. Your tooth fractured and probably exposed the nerve of your tooth which is extremely painful in some situations.     If it hurts really bad when you drink something hot, most likely you need a root canal.    You might be able to see the dentist on an emergency basis since you are in pain. He can do a procedure called an "open and med." That is where he will open your tooth and remove the nerve so you won't be in pain anymore, then put a medication down inside the tooth to relieve any inflammation and infection. You can then made a second appointment to finish the actual root canal procedure after that.     When they finish a root canal they full the canals that the nerves used to be in with a rubber plastic like material so that bacteria can not invade your tooth and create an infection. You will need a crown to cover the whole tooth after that as well.    To control the pain until you can see the dentist you should take 2 extra strength tylenol combined with 2 ibuprofen. That combination is the equivalent pain reliever strength as taking a vicodin, but being non-narcotic.|`|aFkHCpwKaa	I can tell you that the best thing I've found is eating a raw clove of garlic and keeping some on your tooth for a good three minutes.  Other than that, rinse with a cap of hydrogen peroxide and equal parts water. If you have tea tree oil put a drop in the rinse, too.  That should help battle the infection.

dUFzCWHOaa	Its normal for one of the testes to be bigger than the other (But not like super disproportionate).  And how much you ejaculate depends on what you consume and how much you masturbate. Nothing to worry about!! But that's just my opinion. You should still see the doctor.|`|E64juLwJaa	Testicles are never the same size:they are different in size in all men.  So that is nothing to worry about.  And that you ejaculated not that much,means nothing:maybe you were not horny at that time.  I see nothing bad here at all  Planets  But see your Dr to set your mind at ease.|`|mJOLjVaTaa	If you are concerned, please go see your doctor. You have nothing to lose. You will get the correct diagnostic, and you will be sure of what is wrong, if anything|`|b3JKcQXGaa	Sorry, but yeah, it could be bad. Testicular cancer is when a testicle lumps up on one side and keeps getting bigger slowly. If it's tender (more tender than normal obviously, they're always tender!) then it is possibly that. Hopefully it's not man! Sorry. Definetely see that doctor! I'm not sure tho! Good luck tho man!

AekVyLneaa	Check with your son's Dr. to see if he can prescribe him a preventative inhaler.  A preventative inhaler is usually taken once in the morning and once in the evening.  By taking this inhaler in the morning, it should help to prevent any asthma symptoms that he normally encounters during the day.  You can keep his rescue inhalers on standy by for in case that he may wheeze and needs a quick puff.  You are going to find a huge difference in his symptoms if he is prescribed a preventative inhaler.<br>  <br>  <br>  Preventatives that I am talking about are Advair and Symbicort.|`|rJgrwIodaa	Let him eat some dirt.  It's actually good for kids to get germs in their system very early in their development or their immune systems won't get strong.  That's why a lot of children these days have asthma and allergy problems.  Too many anti-bacterial products.  Germs evolve much faster than humans, so the more anti-bacterial products you use, the stronger you're making germs, but because parents are overly concerned with their childrens' health, they are preventing their childrens' immune systems from doing their job.  Obviously, there are times when we need to wash up, but being too clean is actually worse for their health.<br>  Talk to your doctor about why the boy has an aversion to cold things.  It may or may not be related to his breathing problems.|`|I1mhB3Zgaa	Boys are very active by nature, but the inhaler an steroids may cause him to be extra active. Ask your doctor about that. Also boys need to have space to run and play and get that energy out. Didn't mention the age but computer, games or tv does not let them get the energy out and they can't sit still. Basketball or any other activity will help-soccer--also, don't understand the cold inducing products he can't have??? Remember fruits etc turn into natural sugar but there are good books on diet for hyperactive boys. Try the exercise above computer and sit down activities until he is worn out from exercise. If you don't have a big yard try a park twice a day at least. Hope this helped|`|pcLOOgyqaa	i will sugges you to go for breathing exercise ie deep inhaling then hold for a while and then exhale in the morning preferably in the fresh air. this will improve his lung power. and this will definitely help him.
GEIRkfAeaa	It won't hurt you, helium is fine to be inhaled, its not dangerous unless there's a leak in a small enclosed space, then it displaces oxygen, and can cause asphyxiation. <br>  <br>  Do it, then add details about it, then I will too.  It sounds great.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Helium will reduce the effect of the weed.

KOYC3XkJaa	First of all, you should not be putting vinegar, salt, or rum in a wound. A good rule of thumb for home remedies like that is: would you put it in your eye? If you say no, then don't put it on a wound. (Note that is only a rule of thumb, not a hard and fast rule; for example I wouldn't put neosporin in my eye, but I would use it on cuts).<br>  Secondly, yes and no. Cleaning your wound will not make the wound heal faster directly. But keeping the wound clean will prevent infection; since infected wounds take much longer to heal, keeping the wound clean indirectly helps it heal faster. But over-cleaning, especially with harsh things such as peroxide, will slow down the healing process.<br>  Your best bet is wash the wound with soap and water, pat it dry, and apply an antibacterial ointment and a bandage. Change the bandage daily, reapplying ointment each time. That's really all you need to do.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Not necessarily. If done to excess certainly not! I'd say clean it initially then leave it alone.|`|OXP3tSuqaa	Cleaning the wound helps to free dirt and other contaminants that could cause the wound to infect.|`|08Vk3RtJaa	the things you mentioned are very old fashioned remedies (but not necessarily without merit).  Anyway cleaning the wound does help healing by reducing the risk of infection.  These days the wound is usually cleaned with clean water or an antiseptic solution (such as betadine) then covered with a clean dressing or bandage.  Once the wound has scabbed over or the skin has regrown (like in a surgical wound) it can be left unbandage.|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	You need to keep the wound for it to heal so therefore the answer would be yes.   If you do not clean it will become septic and once infested will take longer to heal or even end up poisoning you. I would not however recommend cleaning a would with vinegar, salt or rum.  Lemon is much better if you want to use natural remedy and this also helps the wound heal.    Surgical spirit would be the most recommended way of cleaning a wound|`|vGxipYJnaa	It depends. If you fell down on asphalt, cleaning the wound of any debris would make it heal faster. If you cut yourself with a knife, then no.<br>  <br>  You should always clean wounds to prevent infection.|`|33faa88c71884455d910e28f507d7e99aa	Cleaning the wound doesn't directly help it heal faster. However, it will stop it from becoming infected which would cause the wound to heal slower. So your better off cleaning it.|`|D2clQfVXaa	Yeah, dirt and bacteria cause infections. Infected cuts can take a very long time to heal or cause other complications.|`|46K4FtE0aa	Yes cleaning a wound will help it heal quicker as it gets rid of germs. A dirty wound will get infected and not heal.
IKakoOfyaa	Staph can be highly contagious if you come in direct contact with it.  I'm surprised she is in school with a staph infection unless the infection is localized and bandaged properly.
nlmZI3Xiaa	no no dont worry about it... its common|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I think this might be pieces of tissue from your uterine lining instead of skin. The best thing to do would be to ask your doctor, but I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.|`|GXm20LUKaa	That is sooooo weird I think you should definitely have that checked out by your doctor asap.|`|UdU7E5MIaa	I don't think it's skin, it's probably a bit of sloughed off tissue from your uterus and nothing to worry about.  If you know how periods work, you'll know your body enriches the lining of your uterus in anticipation for a fertilized egg, and when that doesn't happen that lining sheds, and sometimes doesn't completely degenerate before being expelled from the body.  If it persists, speak to your health care provider, but it's not really anything to worry about in small amounts.|`|nq2LWqoKaa	I don't think its anything to worry about. Call your OB and talk to a nurse if it really worries you.
5rJ6nf2oaa	If you feel fine on 1000cal per day then that probably is fine. Your exercise program sounds great and this should keep your metabolism up. If you find your weight loss starts to plateau then that would be the time to up your calorie intake, but the calories need to be derived from the right foods. Read the articles below to understand what these are (you may already know) and how to stimulate your liver to increase it's fat burning function.<br>  Best wishes.|`|vGxipYJnaa	This is a bad idea - sorry. You need a diet that is much more sustainable. You're going to have to start eating more than that eventually, and when you do, you'll pile the pounds back on quickly. <br>  <br>  Your should increase your calories immediately - you might also end up permanently slowing your metabolism if you don't!|`|c3f0c2ff42137562e3110961086554beaa	I would say if you have done the 2 weeks on 1000 calories, thats enough time to kickstart your weightloss, which you have done. I think you should increase your calories to 1300, which is still low, but continue the exercise and you will continue to lose weight. Even without exercise 1300 will cause you to lose weight, however exercise makes your body nice and lean and toned so keep it up!! Why not try 1300 during the week and 1500 at weekends? changing it up keeps your body burning up that fat. good luck!|`|0ab6fc7bd98309110aaef7ff59e4615caa	1000 calorie is not enough and you wont lose the weight that much!  You will need to eat between 1400 to 1600 calorie a day so it will help you to lose the weight.  Eat Breakfast, am snack, lunch, pm snack, and dinner.  Dont eat after 8pm.

0YTuN71aaa	The production of generic versions of brand name drugs is regulated by the government, so you're getting the same active ingredient.  Unless you're sensitive to some fillers in the generic pill, you shouldn't have any problems.  You can contact the pharmacist and tell them about your symptoms, they'll let you know if it's something you should inform your doctor about.
hTmwr6VAaa	you never stop wanting it really, like cigarettes, you just get use to not having it.... i was a heavy pot smoker and then just stopped as my brain was fried... however, i was not paranoid or anything, just stupid all the time! lol.

I used to be a really big user, constant smoking. I didn't have to quit but I chose to, I wanted to live life clearer. It took me roughly a week and a half to sleep without it and the same amount of time before I felt I was thinking normal. Good luck, it really isn't that hard to get over it.

08Vk3RtJaa	it sounds more like an allergy or a type of fungal rash which you are spreading by touch.  Try not to panic.  See a doctor who may prescribe a cream or medication, if that doesn't work he may refer you to a dermatologist (specialist skin doctor) who can check you for allergic reactions.  Aids sufferers who develop a rash are usually fairly advanced with the disease, the rash is not an early symtom.  Since you sound very worried about STDs and AIDS I am guessing you have put yourself at risk (by having unprotected sex), please practise safe sex as your next partner could very well infect you with either of these diseases.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	Sounds like plain 'ol dermatitis to me.

VvwVpl2Yaa	You are probably a teenager. That's normal. You should wash your face twice a day (not more). Lemon juice is really good for reducing excess oil production. Put a lemon juice on your problem zones for 10 - 15 minutes and then wash your face.

bxxwhP04aa	I have gained about 50 pounds in three years on Lexapro.  I was JUST told by a gastroenterologist that this happens ! And he also said it is very diffucult to lose those pounds.  Well,  I am on the track to proving him wrong.  I think the Lexapro makes me hungry all the time.  And I am determined to stop eating only what I need for good health. No more sweet stuff......with sugar in it......and no more second helpings.  I can do it, and so can you !  Best wishes !|`|4Z0G5x52aa	I am in the middle of the same thing, but have successfully lost around ten pounds after gaining nearly 35. A lot of people think that Zoloft causes weight gain because it decreases your metabolism speed, but what I have heard is that it just increases your appetite (which it did for me). It is definitely difficult to lose weight. You got to start off slow. Here's how I did it. I changed my routine. Every morning, I would wake up and eat a BIG breakfast. Make sure that you fill up with carbs, as well as proteins (but don't go crazy on the fats). I would then be full up until lunch, and even then I wasn't too hungry. For lunch, try eating something pretty small. I usually have a peanut butter and banana sandwich (pieces of banana inside). It sounds gross, but it's delicious and VERY nutritious. From lunch to dinner, try to eat maybe an apple or something light, but no HUGE snack. Just something to keep you moving along. Then at dinner, eat something with some carbs and possibly a little fat (maybe spaghetti with meatballs). It may sound like a lot and it may sound worse than your current diet plan (since you are saying you already have a good diet), and I know you aren't looking for diet advice, but sometimes HOW you eat and WHEN can make all the difference. You just need to relax and stay healthy and eventually the weight will start coming off. Also, trying to improve your happiness with Zoloft will help. Being depressed alone makes you gain weight. Good luck.
UdU7E5MIaa	If you miss 3 pills you are supposed to discard that cycle, have your period and then start again that Sunday (read your information pamphlet for your pills).<br>  <br>  You may very well be pregnant.  Missing pills makes them ineffective and it takes an average of about 1-2 weeks for the pills to become effective (if taken correctly) again.  You only took them for a limited time and then stopped again for the placebo (sugar pill) which means that once you resumed taking them, that they weren't effective right off the bat because the correct hormone level was not achieved.  <br>  <br>  Take a test to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Any time you miss EVEN ONE pill you must use an alternative method of protection for SEVEN days.<br>  <a href="http://www.lybrel.com/taking/miss/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lybrel.com/taking/miss/</a>|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Take a test and find out.

Another thing it could say is that she has young children.  When my kids (2 boys) were younger, my car was often more messy than what it usually is now.

Hope it helps.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	chips, cookies, candies, soda, cakes, any sweets, Im sure you can tell if somehting is junk food ro not?|`|1JsWMX0daa	candy, chocolate, cookies, cakes, and sugary/fatty pastries. pringles & such are not too great either.<br>  <br>  oh yea- SODA!!!!|`|SwyZkNn6aa	While all of the above things are obvious foods to stay away from (fast food, chips, cookies, burgers, etc), there are so many foods that might SEEM healthy that are NOT!<br>  <br>  For example, I never eat anything with enriched or bleached white flour.  It is an addictive food and found in even some things that are labeled "whole wheat", so it's important to check labels.  Think of it this way... Remember the paste you used to make in art class with white flour and water?  Well this is what it turns into in your body.  It's awful stuff and hard to digest.  Stick to whole grains (think Triscuits, even Wheat Thins have bleached flour!).  I also stay away from foods that are high in sugar.  In addition, opt for brown rather than white rice, which has also gone through the enriching process.  <br>  <br>  If you eat salads, get the salad with baby spinach rather than plain lettuce.  Spinach has a lot of nutritional value whereas lettuce tends to be mostly water.  And pay attention to your salad dressing, which can be loaded with calories or fat!  I generally use olive oil with balsamic vinaigrette.  <br>  <br>  Drink tons of water.  I try to drink about 70 oz per day.  Water flushes out all of the toxins as well as the stored water in your body.  When your body is getting enough water, it won't "hoard" it which is what makes you gain water weight and look bloated.  <br>  <br>  I started following this nutritional diet and I feel amazing, in addition to working out I can tell a big difference in how I look, too.  You're talking to a girl who loved beer and Chipotle and wine.  I'm actually looking forward to putting on a bikini in a few months!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|HhgWWMRPaa	Hello , <br>  junk food it's mean ( Eating your self to death)..<br>  Junk food is a term used for foods that taste good, are high in calories and quick to prepare, and have little nutritional value. While most people have their own list of foods that they would consider junk food, it generally refers to foods that are high in sugar (such as soda pop, candy, ice cream and most pastries), high in fat (particularly, saturated fat—such as burgers, pizza, hot dogs, french fries and most fried foods) and high in salt.<br>  <br>  thats it, I got more answers , but u must read this first .. <br>  take care of ur self , and Drink Green tea , with out sugar .. <br>  you will lose weight..<br>  take care ,<br>  Unlucky|`|TzPofCDxaa	McDonalds<br>  KFC<br>  Burger King<br>  Chips|`|goch9Twpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  If there’s one thing that’s typically always true about human beings, it’s that they love to eat. Now when I say eat, I mean consume a lot of food. But guess what ? We’re not talking carrots and celery here. Generally we prefer to gorge on junk food galore. Why ? Simply due to the fact that it tastes great! There’s certainly a satisfaction that comes with snacking on some nachos or scarfing down a brownie sundae. My apologies if I’m making you hungry.<br>  <br>  Anyway, different individuals have a different take on whether junk food should be consumed or not. If you ask me, I’d say that all of those tasty sweets and snacks are okay to nibble on, if you put a limit on how much and how often you indulge. Naturally there should be a limit to your junk food intake.<br>  <br>  What would you consider to be unhealthy or junk food ? Most people pinpoint fast food restaurants and sweets. At this point, I think it’s pretty obvious what falls into the junk food category and what does not. Treats like chips, movie theater concessions, candy, chocolate, soft drinks, cakes, pies, and pizza are all clearly foods that do nothing great for your body or health. However, we all already know this. But it definitely doesn’t stop us from purchasing these foods on a routine basis.<br>  <br>  I even know health nuts who eat poorly on occasion. Hey, we all love some junk food. Therefore we’ll all look for ways to eat it sometimes, whether we typically stick to a well-balanced diet or not. When it comes down to it, much of the convenient foods that are bad for you, are also convenient and often less pricey than the healthy foods.<br>  <br>  Since we live in the age of cyberspace, you’d better believe that you can find any and all sorts of junk food just by hopping on the web. Purchase fine chocolates from all over the world, order delicacies that can’t be found in your home town or small city, or buy low-priced bulk items with the simple click of a mouse.<br>  <br>  All sorts of treats and goodies can be found on the Internet. The trick is to limit your junk food intake and be prudent when it comes to your overall health and diet plan. You can enjoy the “junk,” but don’t go too far and allow it to damage your health.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)
pIvN6TY7aa	I've done quite a bit of research about tummy tucks, because I lost a lot of weight quite suddenly (illness), and was left with a bunch of belly wrinkles.<br>  <br>  I was astonished to find that it was going to cost over $8,000 in a Vancouver clinic. <br>  <br>  It was also quite a surprise to find out how seriously invasive the surgery is for a tummy tuck.  It's not just a business of "a nip and a tuck", it involves muscles as well as skin, and a number of weeks (or even months) before being able to resume previous activity.<br>  <br>  I'm not knocking cosmetic surgery: I'm planning to have some of the face & neck bagginess tightened. It's that particular surgical procedure I'm concerned about.<br>  <br>  Yes, I have tummy wrinkles and breast wrinkles and inner-thigh wrinkles.  But I'm also working out a bit with free weights.  (And showing off my shoulders.  I've got great shoulders!!)<br>  <br>  If you do intend to have cosmetic surgery, it is ESSENTIAL that you not be smoking cigarettes.

It may leave scarring and if you have stretch marks they don't go away.|`|h1Fel940aa	I'd do it. If you have loose skin that won't go away, that might be your only option. There's nothing wrong with getting it done. You should be comfortable in your own skin. Plus, it's like a reward for going through 3 pregnancies and losing all that weight. Go for it!!!
xvxT46iJaa	Like everyone else has suggested, i would go to your doctor. They can prescribe you something (like roaccutane sp?).<br>  <br>  Also, this might sound stupid, and i'm aware that this is probably seen as an old wives tale, but when i drink enough water (2 litres a day for me) my skin is better. I'm not saying it will cure you, but for me, if i don't drink enough water (not tea/squash/cordial/diet coke etc just water) on top of whatever else i drink, my skin gets worse.<br>  Try drinking more water and look at what you eat.

Proactiv works great and Neutrogena products are also good for acne. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Zt6eh6VRaa	You have to keep the acne from forming in the first place and you have to use products that go down inside the pore where the problem starts.<br>  <br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.  Then once your skin acclimates to this, then get a stronger benzoyl peroxide formuation – but make sure it doesn’t have pore-clogging ingredients in it. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. It usually takes a combination of a strong exfoliating serum and benzoyl peroxide to get clear. The other thing is to stay ahead of your skin's ability to adapt to products. If you use the same products in the same way your skin won't get clear either. You need to strengthen your homecare every couple of weeks - like using a stronger benzoyl peroxide or using the benzoyl twice a day.<br>  <br>  For free information about:<br>  <br>  1. Acne<br>  2.

It could be dust that's built up since the last time you used it. Checked for mold? Checked your oven? Anything different at work?|`|53524bbcb6ccdb1c71db548c7ef907a3aa	This could be cause by something as small as a viral infection. For example, bronchitis. Bronchitis is normally associated with sore throat, coughing, ect. While the sore throat can last a week the coughing can last for a much longer period of time. I would consult your physician so you can get whatever you may have cleared up as soon as possible. Good Luck and I hope you feel better!|`|s3cvyLYtaa	me 2. for like almost 2 months<br>  <br>  nothing is working for me|`|AA11540024	might be allergies|`|wQwYmhk4aa	ive been coughing for 3 months|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	yes and i have no idea why, nothings helping, I'm sick of it too

LOL|`|08Vk3RtJaa	everyone is different. a woman's cycle can be anywhere from around 24 - 30 days or so, and can change from month to month so you can never really expect it all to work exactly like clockwork.  Your period will probably be irregular for the first six months or so and it it also normal for the amount of discharge to change from month to month for the first little while.  After about 6 months (again this can be different for different girls) your period should settle down and you should become regular.|`|4lTsTliJaa	if you're only on your third month, it's totally okay to be irregular.  you'll start becoming more regular after about a year or so.  make sure to keep pads or tampons with you in case it comes unexpectedly!  if your period doesn't stop after a few days, definitely see your doctor.  but i think you're fine.|`|hMF3kg3Baa	It is normal for some and not normal for others. I started my period when i was about 13, and had them normal and then when I was about 16 I missed for three months and then got them again but they were never regular after that. Nothing was wrong with me it is just the way I got periods.|`|7XGjs8cyaa	It's Normal For it to be irregular.  I Didnt get cramps at first at all i didnt even feel it. But It'll happen in a few months! Dont wish for cramps! theeyy hurt! loL  A good website for you is <a href="http://beinggirl.com" rel="nofollow">http://beinggirl.com</a><br>  It will answer your questions it also has a period calendar it'll be like your bestfriend at the early ages of Puberty|`|PefglUNaaa	yea its completely normal. dont worry. it will be out of whack for about 2 years, so dont worry.|`|J4wTIhsoaa	you will be irregular for some time. It's normal for your first few months.|`|4BLGtt4Caa	when u 1st get it it will usually be very irregular.....|`|pzmqNxJiaa	Your periods will take time to become regular. For most girls it takes 1-2 years. However, it looks like you are kinda regular. Your period is arriving roughly every three weeks. Most women do not have periods every 28 days apart. Normal is considered anything around 21-35 days.<br>  <br>  For more info check this great site out: <br>  <a href="http://women.webmd.com/tc/normal-menstrual-cycle-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/tc/normal-menstru...</a>|`|Kew92tD6aa	Don't worry! It's totally normal. It will take about two years to regulate. I know that stinks, but i'm going through the same thing. I have done a lot of research about this stuff and most tests prove that it takes about two years. It is normal for you to not get cramps also. Sometimes you do and others you just gt lucky. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped:)|`|5sVgIj7faa	oh yeah that's totally fine i started in the summer and i did not get it for three months <br>  so iv been having it but for me it comes earlier than i think it is so yeah its okay happens to me to|`|1WNOQXVlaa	It really wont ever be exact.

[= <br>  The 1st year or 2 is always irregular. When you get older and your body starts to get used to your cycle then it will become normal. <br>  <br>  Like me, One time I was supposed to get my period the next month but it didn't come until 2 months later! haha <br>  Today I started my period but it came like 10days earlier! <br>  So yes, its normal. [=|`|soYU9Tk6aa	sweetie, if this is your first time getting your period, this is COMPLETELY normal. Also, if it isn't, stress can cause spotting and the onset of your period. You could also just be a bit irregular, which is when you are young. If you really feel problems about your periods, you can always talk to a respected woman and an obgyn.|`|5NShLkTkaa	It is normal, very normal to be irregular at first.  Just carry protection with you for unexpected surprises and it takes a couple years, sometimes to be regular.  And when you do become regular, it still doesn't come like clockwork but you will be able to "guestemate" about when.  Don't stress, just let nature do its thing.  This has been going on for a long. long time!|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	Very common when you first start your periods, as they go on they can regulate.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	ya. sometimes my period are like that.
r1Vg6djRaa	carefully position it into the indent and grab the earring with ur pointer finger in front & thumb in the back.. & grab your ear with your other hand and push it through, dont jam it but dont do it slowly either <br>  you'll need some force in order for it to go through. also make sure it doesnt slip or you may end up with two holes<br>  <br>  & it wont really hurt too much it will just get really warm for a few minutes, no big deal|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	So you're trying to stab a blunt object through?  Have you considered opening the hole with a sterilized needle first?|`|iC7cSqotaa	i think it depends on your pain tenancies.  i have this problem too.  I start out inserting the earring slowly, but have trouble pushing through the rear of the earlobe, so i have to jam it in.  Try both.  In that order.  you don't want to aggravate the earring hole, but either way its not going to feel great.  Try some ibuprofen.|`|32QenZrsaa	do it fast, slow hurts more
G0s5uxrEaa	Well, I am in your same age group, and I go on the treadmill every day for a minimum of 20 minutes. The maximum speed I do is 3.6 mph. I do the fat burn program, so the speed increases and decreases which will help you burn fat faster.  So, if your treadmill offers that, it's a good program. For weight lifting, I lift about 8 pounds a day. Starting off, go easy, not too much weight and then gradually lift more weight. Going on the treadmill and lifting weights will help you lose weight and help your muscles get stronger. Good luck! :)|`|J2gBU0NDaa	You do not say how tall you are. However, the basic rule is walking at a good pace, meaning your pulse is above 120-but below 135, for 60mins.  everyday.  Although you will lose a few more calories by running the fat you want to lose on your body, is better lost when you have aerobic workout.  As for weight lifting. Lift enough so you can do 8-12 reps.  And proper way is doing it slow. 2-4 sec. each way.  Do your upper body one day, and the lower body the next.  Have one day a week of full rest.  And doing the walk it can be broken up, 4-15min. 3-20min. or 2-30 mins.  Good luck.
laO3osrwaa	Dude! This totally happened to me! And i actually just went to the doctor today and she told me i have a bladder infection and have to take a persciption. :( Maybe its the same thing for you. YOu should go check it out. O and cranberry juice helps with that aswell. :D|`|PTxaUkwKaa	You're still young, your period won't be completely normal like clockwork. Actually, it won't ever be completely predictable, so relax. Just wear a light day pad if the flow stops earlier than usual, to be safe.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	are you sexually active, if you are it could be serious. If not talk to your doctor.
GcWRPLd6aa	its supposed to be a straw color or lighter. Eating high amounts of fruits/veggies, multi-vitamins could turn it brighter. Also dehydration is a big cause <br>  <br>  it depends on how much you work out or sweat, for exercise it is recommended to drink more for sweat loss|`|BcHLu6uraa	the more deep yellow the pee, the more water you need, ideally, your pee should just have a slight yellow tint.|`|ZyS4Eejqaa	fruits and stuff can turn that color, but if you havent been eating fruit you probably just arent drinking enough water. and yes it should be clear with a little yellow
AP2FnaWcaa	Depends whats wrong with you<br>  <br>  Anything like a cold or flu etc, take vitamin C and immune boosting vitamins. Berries and orange juice is good! Oh and plenty of water so you dont get dehydrated anymore than you already are|`|5KbCIEOTaa	Hot water + 1 slice of lemon + 2 spoonful of honey<br>  <br>  Treats/soothes sore throats, headaches, runny noses, and dizziness.|`|xSayuJ2Baa	drink lots of hot liquids and crackers.|`|nlmZI3Xiaa	go for milk and fruits|`|5UEugyzvaa	Eat chicken noodle soup, and drink tea
GcWRPLd6aa	sounds like you may have a fungal infection of the toe. You might have to talk to the doctor to prescribe some oral lamisil or other anti-fungal treatment. It is pretty common, but treatment is sorta long (up to 6 months) since you have to wait for total new growth of the toe-nails|`|4IPvjWbTaa	go ask your docter
n6IBfiDPaa	ahh! I hate that! It hurts so bad! lol<br>  It either means they are old and you need new ones, most likely<br>  Or they are dirty|`|eWObKmBSaa	You said that you recently started wearing contacts.  ARe they new or is this your first pair?   You need to soak them in a solution thru the night, then when going to apply them in the morning, you need to wash them.  Also if this is a first time with contacts, you can only wear them a few hours a day.  If you are wearing them too long, each day, that could surely    make them burn.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	How long have you had this pair in?<br>  <br>  If over 2 weeks, you need to change them.<br>  <br>  It could be a number of things; your eyes could just be irritated, you could have them on inside out, your contacts are old, you need to clean them better with your solution, you aren't washing your hands before you put them in, or maybe your eyes don't like the solution you are using.<br>  <br>  Try changing them.  If that doesn't work, try changing your solution to one that is made for sensitive eyes.|`|uKFgRHeqaa	possibley. it might be your solution too my solution makes my eyes sting sometimes. Get some blink and clean eye drops put them on your contacts before you put them in. thats what i do hope it helps|`|XzAD49iraa	maybe your eyes dont like the solution..<br>  <br>  i dont know.<br>  <br>  maybe your eyes arnt used to the contacts so thats how they are reacting.<br>  <br>  that what happend to me.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	That means your eyes or dry.<br>  <br>  Or there is something on you fingers that burns your eyes when you try to put them in.|`|z3g6G4cTaa	use solution with it|`|CssyQVD0aa	Stop storing them in Vodka dude!!!|`|668551ae8f7b043f957455c854361b2daa	it either means that they're old or yur hands are just dirty . *|`|3vWpUXsmaa	Make sure you wash your hands really good before you put them in and be sure to clean them with solution before you put them in your eye. I put mine in my palm with some solution and rub them around to be sure they are clean.|`|o34sVykcaa	you have to use solution and make sure your fingers are clean.<br>  sometimes very small particles can stick to your contacts and then it burns.
aSuLnvoSaa	sleep with a cold gel pack around your stumach.<br>  or a hot bath. stretching helps too.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	stretching them out...it may hurt at first, but it feels good afterwords. just lay on the ground and kind of stretch your self out...if you can, try doing a little bridge or bendbackwards to stretch them out...trust me..same thing happened to me yesterday except i did this crazy pilates routine on fit tv...now my abs are good from stretching|`|fOfqPATaaa	Only thing that will take the soreness away is time =( sorry|`|jeDLn5bzaa	enjoy the burn <br>  i love the burn|`|P4I2dCS5aa	Stop getting pregnant.|`|52cnHd6faa	It sounds like you may have strained or pulled some ab muscles because of the sudden and intense workout you've been giving them. A good idea would be to slow down on the ab workouts and let your muscles recover, maybe take this time to work on other muscles? It's important to give your body recovery time after you exercise<br>  Also, you may want to try stretching your abs. a good stretch is to lie down on a floor, face down. Then,place your hands against the floor near your armpits and push yourself up with your hips and legs still against the ground so your back is very arched. you should make a "C-shape" and some people say that doing that stretch makes you look like a seal.<br>  Good luck with your abs!|`|5bHcozktaa	Well I'm not the an expert at this whole exercising thing but I've done what you did oh my god you are right..it can be incredibly painful. However I think you are focusing on the speed of your sit ups too much. Whether you go fast or slow while doing sit ups, either way you are using the muscle so trying to get super fast while doing crunches wont make a huge difference, if anything the slower and longer you hold the crunches, the more it will challenge your muscles, make sense? <br>  ALSO if you awant to avoid sore abs I would work up to a large amount of sit-ups instead of going all out the first time and doing hundreds of sit ups. Start out at like 50 or 100 ...even if you do it every other night you will still get results you don't need to do it ever single night. Then once your abs don't hurt, increase the number little by little. This is actually more effective because you work your way up instead of doing it backwords..this should work your muscles more, build up a tolerance, and challenge them.<br>  I ramble haha...but this is just my experience..work your way up little by little and you will probably get better results and less pain.

She should understand. I hated telling mine cos I thought it would be SO embarassing, but it really wasn't so bad. Just do it. It'll be okay.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	The first person I called was my mom when I got my period. She's a woman too, she's known for years what it's like to have a period! Just tell her, there could be something wrong, and you might need to go to the doctor. She's your mom, all she wants is to be there for you. Trust me, i'm a mom, and I'm only 21.

Promax bars are good. If you have money, get some Wheyobolic 60 and stack it with amplified creatine 189. I'd suggest 1 1/2 cups of wheyobolic in 2 cups of 2% milk. A promax bar and my suggestion for a protein shake is about 750 calories and 65 grams of protein.|`|25782c307317c0aaffde04836672cc50aa	drinks lots of protein and work out your muscles daily in different sections.

3mU9hRluaa	Hi. I use Acuvue Oasys contact lenses and they're really great! <br>  Contacts don't hurt at all. You're eye might be a little sore from poking them when you're first learning to insert them and take them out but after that, you won't feel them at all.<br>  I usually put them in at around 7 AM and take them out later at night around maybe 9 PM. You can just tell when you need to take them out. Ya know? If you can't take them out because you aren't home or something, I suggest buying some rewetting drops. Make sure they are for contacts! I'm 14 and I got my contacts when I was 12 and in 6th grade. I used to freak out about anything in my eye. But now it doesn't bother me. I can touch my eye and it doesn't even bother me. Just make sure you wash your hands before putting in your contacts! Talk to your eye doctor. They're really great things! :D<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Y6xL1D70aa	I remember the first time I ever put them in it was absolute hell!! But you gradually get used to them and they really don't hurt a bit, If they do that means that theres something on the lense. I use acuve and I highly recommend them. You should always take your contacts out before you go to bed, unless you buy the contacts that are specially made for long time wear. I know the doctor will show you how to put them in but I watched a video on youtube that helped alot more than the doctor did... Heres the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX1KmYcyP4Q&feature=PlayList&p=1D5A91BE7CF6844B&index=0&playnext=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX1KmYcyP...</a>|`|of049X1waa	contacts do not hurt at all!  They might be a little difficult to put in at first, but they are easy to take out, and you don't even feel them.  I use Acuvue 2 and basically it doesn't even feel like there is anything in my eye.  I sometimes even forget I am wearing them and put my glasses on!<br>  <br>  As for taking them out, you should not sleep in them.  Take them out in the evening and put them back in when you wake up.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	They don't hurt, they might feel different from not having them in, but i personally think they are totally comfortable.  The only time they would hurt is if like a peice of dust or whatever is on it when you put them on, but you just have to clean them well and they'll be fine.  <br>  I put mine on  in the morning and take them off at night, i can't have them on too long, like more than like 15 hours, after 12 hours they start to bother me and start to get kinda blurry which i need to take them out now.  <br>  My mom on the other hand practically never takes off her contacts and sleeps with them on and she says they don't bother her at all, but i can't do that, and plus that isn't healthy for your eyes.  <br>  <br>  Contacts are fine, they don't hurt, i've been wearing them for years.  At first they are a little hard to put them in and out but after a while it becomes really easy and quick.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what brand i have, i just trust my eye doctor(but i hate the eyedoctor i currently have, she is stupid, never going back there again)  But i have a special brand cause my stupid eye doctor said that i needed special one's that fit better-meanwhile i've always had regular contacts, and the "special" ones cost a ton of money, i hate that doctor.  <br>  <br>  But yea, you should get them.  Just make sure you clean them everyday and do as is directed.
WOHc22Xiaa	All the impression is, is to take a mold of your gums so the partial fits exactly into your mouth. The medal thing does not hurt it is just exactly as they say so it will snap onto your teeth. The partial needs something to hold onto. you'll be fine.
a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	If you are talking about the side effect of Depo Provera regarding bone loss, it does not matter what part of the body you get the shot.|`|PTxaUkwKaa	By "bone density", do you mean your calcium level being low, causing bone loss? That's what the shot does, wherever you get it. It depletes your calcium level a bit, your doc probably tells you to take calcium supplements. I always got it in my hip, because it's a fleshier area. I stopped getting the shot, because I hate taking huge calcium pills, and it really screwed with my body. I now take the pill, and will never take the shot again. Your choice, though.

And i feel like im wearing a diaper. i also felt really nervous to use them so when i finally tried it stung really bad. and i have tried to use them since but i get the same stinging feeling so i have stopped. im going to a concert this weekend and i have my period at the moment so i want to get a hold on using them before then because i dont want to wear a pad while im jumping up and down. :(<br>  <br>  some of my friends have told me that using lubricant to slide it in, means it wont hurt. I dont know if i want to do that though but if you have to...then i guess you just have to.<br>  <br>  I hope ive helped at least a little bit.

I can get the applicator in that's not the hard part, It just hurts really bad to get the actual tampon in. You could try laying on your bed with your feet up and then inserting the tampon(I heard that works, I might try it).<br>  <br>  And it's messed up because my mom said when she was a teen she wore tampons for swimming and they hurted every time. Where as my sister wheres tampons and they don't hurt at all. And then ME, I try to wear tampons and they hurt! It sucks, trust me. I'm a dancer(leotards), I feel your pain.<br>  <br>  I think every girl is different.

Go ahead and give them a shot!<br>  <br>      * Fiber -- Both types of fiber, insoluble and soluble can help your weight loss efforts.<br>  <br>            o Insoluble fiber provides volume to food without adding a lot of calories. Foods rich in insoluble fiber include high fiber cereal, whole wheat bread, wheat bran, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>            o Soluble fiber helps stabilize your blood sugar levels, which in turn can better control hunger and cravings. Also, this type of fiber slows down the transit time of food in your gut, so it may keep you fuller for longer. Foods rich in soluble fiber include strawberries, apples, pears, oatmeal, chickpeas, and beans.<br>  <br>      * Juicy Foods -- Fruits and veggies with a high water content "built into the food" helps to fill you up, so you'll eat less collectively throughout the day. Go for watermelon, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, mushrooms, grapefruit, and cantaloupe.<br>  <br>      * Lean Protein -- Protein can slightly rev your metabolism after ingestion (more so than carbs and fat). Be sure to include some type of lean protein with every meal. Good sources include chicken breast, canned light tuna, wild salmon (fresh and canned), egg whites, crab, shrimp, tilapia, turkey breast, tofu, lean red meat, low-fat dairy, beans and lentils.  <br>  <br>      * Foods That Make You Work  -- People eat less of the very same foods when they require a bit of work. For example, buy shelled peanuts versus unshelled peanuts and prepare soybeans in the pod versus the straight bean.<br>  <br>      * Sugarless Gum -- Contrary to what people think, sugarless gum does not stimulate your appetite. In fact, it's a great way to give your taste buds a shot of flavor and prevent yourself from popping something caloric in your mouth. Keep a pack of sugarless gum on hand (or a pack of mints).<br>  <br>      * Hot Beverages -- Sipping a hot, low-cal beverage is a great way to stave off extra calories when you're looking to eat out of pure boredom. And because they're hot, you'll have to slowly sip over an extended period of time. Choose beverages under 100-calories such as green and herbal teas, diet hot cocoa, skim latte and cappuccino, and reduced sodium bouillon.<br>  <br>      * Spicy Food and Capsaicin -- Personal clients and research have reported that you're often satisfied with less food when the meal is spicy hot. Plus, you automatically eat slower and drink more water! If your taste buds can handle the heat, add chili peppers, hot sauce and salsa to your meals.<br>  <br>      * Pre-portioned Snacks -- There's no chance of overeating when you only have one portion in front of you. Try the following legalized snacks when you want something fun: 100-Calorie Pack, Glenny's soy crisps, Skinny Cow-Silhouette flying saucer, Healthy Pop mini bag microwave popcorn, Nature Valley granola bar, Pria bar, People Pop, Tootsie Pop, Weight Watchers ice cream pops, or a Swiss Miss/Jell-O fat free pudding.|`|JynXHKoVaa	celery<br>  apples|`|qv5OyWoPaa	a big burgerrrrrrrrr make u lose weight. lol
z3g6G4cTaa	that happened to me once, but it went away in a few days|`|j6Qa4DbEaa	Hmm...could be pink eye, in which cause it is contagious and could spread to your other eye. You really should go see the Dr. so he can give you meds to make it go away.
KiVHOebQaa	you just stay calm. if you dont feel nothing then theres nothing wrong. maybe the amount of nail polish you ingested is too small that it had no ill effect. anyway if you were poisoned by that you would have probably been vomiting or nauseated already.|`|wocyfQ2Xaa	Take A deep breath and relax. Generally small amounts of a substance will not affect a person. If you begin to vomit, feel week, or dizzy then i suggest calling 911 or a national poison control center. Please remember to keep handy the substance you ingested just incase their is an issue.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped<br>  Get well soon :)|`|5yRtpe9baa	probably to be safe you should call poison control and ask them if what's happening is ok and stuff. it should have the number on back of the nail polish remover|`|Z2ErfHpoaa	You should relax. An amount that small won't do anything except leave a bad taste in your mouth. I would eat something, though.|`|DdSKcoOSaa	cut some water chestnut to eat /blend it with water into the blender to drink.repeat three four times.this was advise by elderly folks .|`|OCEYVPGXaa	you should read the back of the remover bottle and see what you should do ASAP|`|um6rmdegaa	if you are concerned call the national poison control 1 800 376 4766|`|ZHAIyaIDaa	If it was just a teeny tiny bit then dont worry your fine. I accidently do that too. And when I do I just eat a piece of bread and drink some milk. I dunno why though. But it works.
P76MLs5caa	It is very high! You need to stop exercises for now and immediately  see a doctor!!! 204 is way too high!  DO NOT DO ANY EXERCISES WITHOUT CONSULTING A DOCTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|9Ik3OMRKaa	204/90 is way too high for any circumstance.<br>  <br>  Normal should be 120/80.<br>  <br>  Anything over 140/90 on either number, needs to be treated.<br>  <br>  Get daily blood pressure readings for a week, then go see your MD with the results, if they are abnormal.<br>  <br>  There is always the chance that the reading of 204/90 was an error.|`|dHg78Phdaa	that seems pretty high. Se your doctor and he give you a blood pressure medicine like propranolol or verapamil.|`|sHEgcXHaaa	Well, you aren't supposed to measure your blood pressure after exercising...you're supposed to wait until you've completely become rested again...<br>  <br>  If you check it right after exercising of COURSE it will be high...blood's been pumping through you like crazy!<br>  <br>  Check again when you're completely at rest...then it should look better...
gfmTgLDKaa	Yes that is very good indeed, but first off 30 minutes isn't going to cut walk/jog it has to be jog/run for at least an hour. Since your toning and not maintaining you have to work harder, the work out is fine though, I don't know about anyone else but personally I think that's an excellent routine.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to stretch :D<br>  <br>  P.S. doing such routine build strength in the ab muscle, doesn't necessarily mean it will be toned. What you must do is burn the layers of fat that is in front of the ab muscle, you can do this by running, cardio workout, and the likes. Eating the right food is also very impactive.|`|7fIAqGpuaa	that seems like a really long core workout. mine isnt near that and i got a 6 pack out of it.<br>  i do:<br>  plank (however long im feelin it lol)<br>  side plank ( same thing)<br>  leg lifts - 3 sets of 25<br>  sit upd - 3 sets of 25 <br>  <br>  i also add in a few every now and then. it varies quit a bit but it basically revolves around those. hope this sorta helps
cZhxp9f4aa	I haven't had my period for at least 2 years when i went to the doctors they said i had enlarged ovaries.. they put me on the pill but i recently stopped taking it because it made me gain a lot of weight and it made my skin bad..<br>  <br>  depends on what doctor you go to i went to my health doctor and they did a ultrasound and saw my ovaries were enlarged.<br>  <br>  but being underweight can stop your period also working out can affect it also.<br>  <br>  your best bet is just seeing a doctor. <br>  the side effects might make you have trouble having kids in the near future.|`|VUKDrd2taa	Wow, you seriously need to go to the doctor, somethings not right, they probably will do a pap smear but those aren't bad.<br>  <br>  Not all birth control pills will make you gain weight, just talk to your doctor about which one is right for you.<br>  <br>  Im not sure about the side effects because you dont know whats wrong, but it could be dangerous to let it go that long.|`|9FNUgfg7aa	you ll ve to get it checked out. it is not normal. and it certainly is not due to any exercise. they might give you some estrogenic drug most probably. i would like to know if you re usin any drug right now...? some androgenic to improve your performance? anyways please get it checked as soon as possible. a pap smear is to rule out cancer and is routinely done on women. it isnt painful either. you dont ve any symptoms of cancer... so cool bout it alright...? if you dont get yourself treated it might affect you when you want to ve a family. so pls get it checked. all the best.
dHg78Phdaa	Drysol is a anti-perspirant. You really cant overdose on it.
1JsWMX0daa	very good as far as it is high in protein & low in fat. add a good mix of fruits & especially veggies for your vitamins & minerals, or at least add a vitamin supplement to make sure you are not missing any nutrients. GNC is the best for vitamins- just dont get anything else there. take a look at the ultra mega line. just keep good variety in both your diet & excercise routine. good job & good luck.|`|WS9TooJKaa	That's the best meal plan I've ever seen. But add 2 more fruits/vegetables.
jbEibn2Naa	It's a good idea you are telling her now, because lots of girls are having them earlier, and she needs to be prepared. You can find lots of books at the local library, they are thousands out there. It will come naturally when you explain what they periods are, and listen to all her questions and be prepared to hear '... 'does it hurt?' or 'really???? Is this true', because you will get loads of questions, and she'll feel safer hearing information from you, rather than a book.|`|jLo14Xj2aa	don't go to books..it should come natural to you as a mother. wait until shes at least 11 or 12. and school should teach her too if you have trouble.|`|tVHFekZlaa	Oh its so akward and it will make her so uncomfortable. But, there is this book called "girls book on growing up" its very descriptive. I think that you should just warn her about her period but dont like train her because she will learn it in 6th grade and it just gets annoying when parents nag you about stuff. I mean once she gets her period then talk to her about how much a child costs. Good luck|`|WLLqdPXeaa	This is a fact of life. Don't hesitate and tell your experiences to your daughter but not in advance. Just wait for it and only then tell her anything. There is no need of any book.|`|PgYWSUeEaa	honesly just tell her about your experiences. shes going to be grossed out and act like she doesnt want to here it but it will be nice bonding time. make it into a joke or a secret itll be fun.|`|YJgf8SzGaa	go ask alice<br>  <br>  is a great book to cover drugs sex puberty <br>  its a little revealing <br>  and might take some innocence from her but she will eventually learn it <br>  why hold back?
EWCQ4XDKaa	I agree with Mike Q|`|0ectWZxAaa	I had a friend that was writing a book about why fear was bad. He did not believe in fear. He ended up robbing a store, breaking out of prison and killing 2 cops. Now he is on death row. <br>  <br>  Some fear is good and protects you from consequences.|`|tgROmqffaa	not really. you can't do anything physically to change it.  Its all in the mind and is completely normal in all living creatures.  If you were immune to fear you couldn't live because you would get killed doing something stupid that you can't do.|`|Tq8B6zF8aa	do everything in the whole world thats scary to you|`|AfhqGA1kaa	um...not that i know of..try therape.or something!|`|jGacenaiaa	Don't do drugs or drink.|`|Wf5p3jqKaa	Booze
jcXsclHYaa	You need to be patient. the effects will come. Just remember that you are drinking a lot of water, which weights as well. So I am sure you are losing fat, you and not losing weight because you are drinking a lot of water.<br>  <br>  To improve the effects remember to exercise. 5 times a week would be great.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You need to eat LESS to lose weight, not just better.  You need to consume less calories than you`re burning and it doesn`t matter if you eat 3000 calories of vegetables and other healthy foods if you only need 2000 (for example).|`|0AyWQ9Blaa	Three ads for one questions. Not bad... <br>  <br>  You're gaining weight in water. You'll pee it out in a few days, so don't worry about it.

Your BMI is pretty much ideal. In other words, you should weigh basically what you weigh now! The "right" weight is all subjective though, as some people are physically incapable of reaching their appropriate BMI and still look quite slim. You have to take bone and muscle mass into account here. If you're a tiny framed 5'8, you should weigh less than someone with a larger structure. But if you're looking for a full-on SHOULD here, congrats- you're at it!|`|gM3tw8Ifaa	OMG your perfect!!!

3nCA4768aa	Well, certain parts of your body are more sensitive than others. I was born with high pain tollerance, and bassicly what that means is you can handle pain much more easily than most other people. It doesnt mean you dont feel pain as bad as anyone else. However you may have stronger muscles in your feet than your freinds. It may just be natural to you. Some girls fake it for attention though. In your case you may have sprained it in a lesser degree than what you might expect it to be. It all depends, everyoen yells when they stub their toe lol i know i do, mostly because im mad or wasnt expecting it. My parents say they only remember me crying once, and that was when i broke my leg in Pre-K lol.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	pain tolerance is basically how much pain you can tolerate, i have no tolerance so anything out of the ordinary is too much for me, a sprained ankle does hurt, I have had many and ankle and knee surgeries, but everyone's tolerance is different a high tolerance only means you can withstand a lot of pain
kdSuwt8paa	You just have to eat more than that.   I presume you eat dairy products if you are not vegan?   You need to have breakfast and lunch.   You can have toast with honey or vegemite for breakfast and alternate that with cereal and yoghurt.   Take a proper lunch - a big salad and a cheese sandwich would be a good option.    You could include a hard-boiled egg instead of cheese on some days.    Still have your nibbles during the day and then your evening meal as usual.   You are not a good advertisment for vegetarianism if it means you are not eating properly!    That breakfast and lunch is perfectly ordinary food and is suitable for vegetarians (but not vegans).|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	You sound like me, I will sometimes eat some dinner and snack during day.  I don't have a thing for  food the way most people do.  I use it only to live not to live to eat.|`|UOWQb3KYaa	I LOVE EATING EAT CHOCOLATE ITS VERY ADDICTING!!!<br>  <br>  Chocolate is my herion<br>  <br>  ooooooooohhhh i just made that up right now thats gonna be my new sig <33 XD<br>  lol<br>  <br>  make soup get chicken broth...and veggietables and salt and pepper and make it its D-LICIOUS <3333333<br>  <br>  wow ur skinny <3 (so am i)|`|GZonOcBhaa	i would look up some good recipes on the internet for vegetarians. if you like fruit try some strawberries and blueberries 4 breakfast.
nqXJ9SGXaa	everyone is different and there is no certain age because not everyone gets wet dreams and not everyone ever has them go away. simple as that. if you do not like wet dreams, try masturbating before bed, or if you have a partner, engage in safe sexual activity to calm those hormones down.|`|PgYWSUeEaa	a wet dream is you pretty much masterbating in your sleep. i would suggest masterbating b4 you go to bed or tie your hands to the posts of you bed =\ sorry|`|zp0LvPrPaa	when you are sexually satisfied tehe|`|7f2neJLraa	you control it the way you feel.|`|a13c13011ce2a1be44f3299d6d2dc21eaa	Masturbate before going to bed|`|764Hudunaa	if you are single at 80 or iuntil you have sex regularly with a partner|`|DCixOqsnaa	Just enjoy it.

HcS8vzNCaa	Acai berriy ads seem to be everywhere these days.  Every time you open your email box, you find half a dozen more.  Then there are the pay-per-click ads wherever you go too.  How do we sift through all the information to find the truth that lies beyond making a fast buck?<br>  <br>  The first place to go has to be academic research institutions.  Their conclusions are most credible.  The least credible place to go to find out if acai berries "really work" is the hucksters who will say virtually anything to make a quick buck.  <br>  <br>  Researchers at the University of Florida have analyzed the acai berry extensively.   Dr. Stephen Talcott, director of the stidy, found that the anti-oxidants in acai berries destroyed cultured human cancer cells. <br>  <br>  Another report from Amherst touted the nutritive benefits of the little purple berry from the Amazon rain forests.  (Let's hope we don't destroy what's left of the Amazon rain forest looking for these berries.)<br>  <br>  This small, dark blue  berry is packed with natural antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E and special phytonutrients called anthocyanins.  An important tool for ensuring our diets contain enough anti-oxidants is the ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) scale developed by the USDA.  Anti-oxidants destroy harmful free radicals..  Acai berries rank very high on the list <br>  <br>  However, the marketing of acai has been an arena full of scams.  Some companies have been known to dilute the acai berry portion of the  pills to nothing or next to nothing.  Others will keep taking auitomatic payments out of your checking account even after demanding such payments stop.Acai Power has been involved with consumers who claim their accounts were dunned long after notifying the company to stop shipping.  Please read the rip-off report below.<br>  <br>  Remember reading about the California Gold Rush of the mid-nineteenth century? Keep in mind that the real economic winners were those shrewd enough to sell miners' tools and clothes. Google makes money off all those ads for Acai Berries, even if the advertisers don't.  <br>  <br>  Acai berries are a legitimately healthy food to eat, but please do some research before you buy anything online. I would avoid the Acai Power, since I can see they have a history of billing problems.<br>  <br>  Review sites can be misleading too. The reveiwer of the review sites often needs to be reviewed. Does his commercial interrest in the products he reviews override his objectivity?<br>  <br>  The best bet would be buy some in person at a local health food store, on a one-time purchase.  See how you feel after taking the capsules.  I would avoid those online purchases that involve automatic billing until you are more sure of whom you are dealing with.|`|T8IFOfHCaa	no but wu yi tea does|`|cQhSLfKYaa	This site reviews different brands of Acai, it should help<br>  <a href="http://acai-for-health.onthewebs.com" rel="nofollow">http://acai-for-health.onthewebs.com</a><br>  <br>  they have some good discounts too.

wocyfQ2Xaa	Hi im 15 and I recently experienced the same problem. After a visit to my primary physician she informed me that my diet(meat, cheese, raw materials, and fruits) had caused parasites in my intestines. The problem was very serious, I was admitted to the and kept for several days for treatment. I advise you see your primary physician soon, or if you do not have one report to the ER. This problem requires immediate medical attention!<br>  <br>  I hope this helped<br>  Get Well Soon :)|`|0rpN2419aa	You are young to have had your gall bladder removed.  Have you discussed these symptoms with your Dr.?  It could be because of the diet you are eating too...meats, cheese and eggs are fatty foods, and I think after you have had your gall bladder removed, you need to eat a diet higher in fruits and vegetables and low fat meats.  <br>  I have had gall bladder problems and have pain right in the middle of my tummy...need to have it taken out, but because of serious  other health problems, I hesitate.<br>  <br>  Please cut down on the fatty foods and see how you do.  If you aren't feeling well after that, you need to go back to your Dr. and tell him your symptoms.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel about sarcstic answers.  They hurt and there is no reason for people to be unkind when we are hurting.<br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon!  take care!|`|AA10860286	Obviously, I'm no doctor. Obvious also is the fact that there is something wrong. It could be a reaction to your diet, or have something to do with your gall bladder removal, but on another level, it could be a virus or something, and you are dehydrating because of the amount of water you are losing. That is one of the dangers of diarrhea. You should consult a doctor, because it may be something simple, or maybe not. There are over the counter things like Imodium that can help if it's just a temporary condition. You won't find a cure or even good medical advice here except for the obvious "see a doctor".|`|87f15c1d0470297070f9c2979c0db020aa	You may have post-cholecystectomy diarrhea.  Your Dr. may give you Questran to bind the bile acid.  I'd see my Dr. for this.|`|um6rmdegaa	the smart thing to do is to call your doc. or th e.r. for info.|`|OCEYVPGXaa	i agree with (Older) you should call your doctor cause i got my gal bladder remover and it ain't no joke its serious
Mumfvpuzaa	100% covered.  right before surgery i was thinking i would miss them.  but i am so happy with the result.  i was a 32DDD/E and now i am a 32C.  the scars are flat and thin and a little noticable but by next oct (1 year) they will be barely visible.<br>  i would make the same decision again, i love the results.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	It probably looks like I did and they accidently took too much out. haha but sadly no :( <br>  Its just how I am lol|`|MiKrWuM6aa	My mom had one, but it was for medical reasons.  She was getting migraine headaches because of too much weight from her breasts.  It was pulling on my neck, giving her the headaches.  If worked for a little bit, but after awhile the headaches came back.  She says she would have never gone through the surgery if she knew it would not work.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	I like my 34C bossom =)<br>  <br>  But if ever I had the size like yours, I think I would consider reduction as well. Sometimes, huge boobies tends to make you look chubbier.
IMPvzBk1aa	Avoid constipation by altering your diet, and use Preparation H to treat symptoms.|`|rHXNxmgbaa	The best thing to do is to AVOID EATING HOT FOOD. If you've gone to the doctor, continue to use the ointment the doctor prescribed.
IMPvzBk1aa	It isn't recommended.  the constriction of circulation has been thought to contribute to a risk of breast cancer.  I'm not sure whether or not that has been disputed.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	yes, a lot of women do.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I do, never take it off unless i'm going to shower. Could be because I'm not comfortable with my breast flopping around all over the place, but that is just me. Some say it'll help them stay up where they're supposed to be. If you comfortable with it, no biggie!|`|PTxaUkwKaa	If it feels comfortable, sure.

NVxGp317aa	I would continue to ice it and keep it elevated. I would definetly get a repeat xray and if necessary they can do a mri.sometimes if there is a lot of swelling they can miss smaller fractures. Also the theory of if u can move your hands or fingers its not broken is false. Depending on were the break is our how bad it is you can possiable still have movement it will just be painful. Take some tylenol and try not to use it. If you don't trust the dr go to a urgent aid or a walk in clinic. Good luck.|`|Y4PlORYqaa	If its swollen and sensitive then it is most likely broken. I broke my wrist also and I could move my fingers still and the wrist a tiny bit so just because you can move your fingers doesn't mean you didn't break it. I would get another X-Ray just to be safe.|`|N64xw4lNaa	if you can move your hand and your fingers without a problem, its not broken.|`|7WRMpSVXaa	get an x-ray|`|wwwiWaK8aa	if u cant move it , it's broken.<br>  go back for a proper x ray<br>  don't wait too long!|`|AA11989999	You'd know if the wrist were broken, There would be a big sag in your forearm (unless it were just a hairline fracture.). And X-rays see through the entire arm, so there is no correct side to x-ray, although a better view might have been had from a different angle. Relax. You are 99% probably OK. Severe bruising of muscle, tendons, etc., would make that big sag I talked about , if you had a real break in the bone.
d1acfd2b69dcb7239283328cfde761c5aa	Since your so young, I would recommend just taking a good protein powder and a multivitamin. and some Omega complex. And eat allot of course.|`|AA10093963	Thats alot dude! Here take it from me I am a personal trainer at Bally Total Fitness. First of all you are waaaaaaaaaaaay to young to be taken any type of supplements right now your 16 so your body is till growing my advice is to eat a chicken breast after every workout there is your protein right there, but if you insist I would recommend only taking WHEY protein after your workouts. You should not have to stack different supplements with eachother it also depends on your workout routine you should being doing one hour max with no breaks, then ingest your protein and call it a day. By the way if anyone ever suggests taking Creatine don't take it! FYI Creatine justs adds water weight to your muscles and water weight eventually turns into fat you don't want to have flabby muscles. I hope this helps!
dpgXzMenaa	Sounds to me like he was just as eager as you were... but a lot less certain of how to handle it than you were.<br>  <br>  If you like the guy, give him time... and encourage him, but not too aggressively: sounds like he's pretty unsure of himself just yet.|`|rswiEosSaa	I don't know.

Try to concentrate on the grades first, worry about boys and the little games they play later.|`|AA10480735	He was probably just surprised that you were wanting to make out with him. <br>  Wait a few days and see if he'll talk about it or do it again.|`|iQwvYzZraa	He's a player.

He's probably waiting for some sign from you that you're up for it.  He doesn't want to scare you or take things too fast.  If you're dating and you want it, go for it.  If he's not into it, he'll tell you.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	You are still too young is what it means.

f8mLpPXlaa	The essence of her perfume persisted to linger in my immediate area.  Receding with the breeze but drawing me with it to try to capture that moment again. It was like my world was centered on that scent. It wouldn't just leave my mind.And it kind of aroused me too, as perfumes are supposed to do. Then a cop pulled over and told me I had been  lingering too long. There was no way to explain the moment but i knew it would be a part of me forever.|`|z50SEsYiaa	Linger is an Infinitive Verb<br>  Lingering is a past/present tense verb<br>  <br>  I hate people who Linger.<br>  The man was lingering around the corner.
g9vw4ovGaa	I got my first abnormal pap smear while I was pregnant, normally it is due to hormones, and my  next annual visit my pap came back normal. I had dysplesia, which is known to come from the HPV desies, which I didn't even have! Alot of women's paps come back abnormal after or during pregnancy, no need to worry unless they say its cancer cells!|`|pJiTbIpYaa	I had an abnormal smear just as i find out i was pregnant. I was very worried for a while but is was like yours and very mild. It has been almost two year and everything is still fine. My mother has abnormal smears too so it might just be genetic for me. If it bothers you i would ask the doctor to do a pap smear every six months. That way you will have peace of mind.
396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	Lots of people rally and come back from AIDS related illnesses.  I had PCP last February.  My t-cells were 13 and I had the same diarrhea and weight loss.  It was all I could do to muster the energy to eat the food they brought me and to simply keep breathing.  I am catholic and my family had a priest come in to give me last rights.  When the priest anointed my head, I felt a profound energy fill my body.  I believe it gave me the strength I needed to recover.  I'm doing much better now and my HIV is getting under control with my meds.  Hang in there.  I'll be praying for your brother and for you.|`|GrnIjiMiaa	The other's have summed it up really well. I just wanted to add that both you and your brother will be in my thoughts during this difficult time. I can't imagine what either one of you are going through....wishing peace and good health|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Things will depend how well he responds to the treatments that he is getting. One thing for sure he is in a good place for medical care. If he can fight and gain a little weight and stay on his medication there is a chance he can still have quality of life. What would be good information to get is where his T-cell count is. I had to be 200 or below to be diagnosed with AIDS, but I have know people who have rallied, even if that should happen the AIDS label will not be removed.<br>  <br>  As it was suggested it might be a good idea to have a conversation with him about what he wants. My partner had been HIV+ for 25 years, T-cells are nearing 200 and has major liver problems from the medications. He has made it very clear if he is hospitalized with no hope for quality of life that no special measures are to be taken, we have this with health care proxies, DNR's, and wills. Is there someone there that has these instruments?  For his quality care this is very important. <br>  <br>  On a very personal note, somehow you will get the strength to get through all of this, you do have a lot on your plate, my thoughts and prayers are with you and your brother.|`|AA10928446	This is a loaded question because so many factors go into determining the lifespan of someone with AIDS, such as whether or not he is on a drug cocktail, what his CD4 count is, what his overall health was prior to Salmonella poisoning. I will be honest with you and tell you that once a person reaches full blown AIDS their CD4 count gets dangerously low. This means that their body is unable to protect them from common illnesses that healthy people would not get sick by. This is what makes them so fragile in terms of health. I assume that he is not on any antiviral medication regime since he has been AIDS for the past 2 years. This will cause his CD4 to get progressively lower until his body is unable to protect him at all. Im sorry that you have to go through this with your brother. You yourself need to begin to prepare yourself for the eventual death of your brother. I know this is something that is extremely difficult but you need to be prepared for the worst case scenario.|`|zkWM5wMgaa	In addition to Dr. Emily. You should be talking with your brother and it would be a great idea to have a sort of "family conference" with your brother and the physician. That way you can ask all of your questions to his physician and then he or she can address them for you.<br>  <br>  Also, in most hospitals there are chaplains available (not only for religious reasons) and they may be able to help you with what you are going through. There are many resources available to you, you just need to ask someone (a nurse, physician, unit clerk...) to point them out to you.
f8mLpPXlaa	A cold. Your membranes inside your nose are swollen and don't let air in and out easily so you get that whistling or wheezing sound. Try a nasl spray. There are lots of them on the market. Just ask the pharmacist and tall him what the problem is and he'll be sure to direct you to the product he makes the most profit on. Or just go to that aisle and choose one yourself. Benadryl is really good but makes you sleepy. Proably best taken at night.

WWVshXqiaa	I'm thinking that you mostly just need to work on your muscles.  Yes, you should jog and eat healthy but the thing I think will help you would be to do crunchs and different exercised that will work your ab muscles.  You may need to lose a little weight too, it really depends on the situation.
aEeloKicaa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

If you really stop eating sugar this will help stop your craving.<br>  3. Eat enough vegetables & fruit, in that order. LOTS of raw veggies will help the cravings.<br>  4. If all else fails, masturbate at night when you get these cravings.  The brain has 'pleasure sensors" that you can 'feed' with sex instead of food.<br>  Try it, it works!

xmibEEdcaa	It doesn't target the headache itself. It lowers the degree of pain you're feeling from anything, by acting on your central nervous system.<br>  <br>  Here's an excerpt of one explanation of how it works:<br>  <br>  "Non-opioid analgesics work by inhibiting an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is a catalyst for the conversion of a fatty acid contained in cell walls—arachidonic acid—to substances known as prostaglandins.<br>  <br>  "Prostaglandins serve a number of protective functions in the body, but they can also produce pain, inflammation and fever. They cause pain and inflammation after cell injury by a number of mechanisms, primarily at the site of the injury in the peripheral nervous system, that is, nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, but also in the central nervous system. They elevate body temperature by affecting the heat regulating center of a region of the brain known as the hypothalamus.<br>  <br>  "By blocking COX and, therefore, the subsequent production of prostaglandins in the central and peripheral nervous systems, non-opioid analgesics reduce both fever and inflammation. Acetaminophen, however, differs from the other non-opioids in that it does not block COX in the peripheral nervous system to an appreciable extent. It appears to reduce pain primarily in the central nervous system by more than one mechanism, possibly in part by inhibiting a form of COX known as COX-3, although this is the subject of much debate."<br>  <br>  -- Ewan McNicol, Tufts Journal<br>  <a href="http://tuftsjournal.tufts.edu/2008/04/professor/01/" rel="nofollow">http://tuftsjournal.tufts.edu/2008/04/pr...</a><br>  <br>  Also, as you can see, Tylenol isn't an NSAID.  NSAID stands for "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug." Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are the most common NSAIDs. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) has no anti-inflammatory properties and therefore isn't one, although it is a great pain-reliever.|`|upwwspFIaa	It doesnt find your headache.

I have spent the last few months building muscle but its under a gnarly layer of fat I can't stand to look at.  I have talked to a number of body builders in the past few weeks and they all agree its time to "diet down".  Here is the hard part.  You have to reduce the amount of strength training and raise your cardio. My friend is getting ready for a competition in May and she has extended her cardio to 2 hours a day and completely cut out carbs... Meaning no cheerios friend. Slim Fast is heavy in sugar (even thou the label says no).  Her diet is  oatmeal (1cup) in the am, protein shake 3 hours later, cabbage and a piece of chicken @ lunch, 3 eggs @ three after that.  Then chicken and a salad for dinner. If u are in hungry after that then have another protein shake...  The key here is that u have little or no sugar. Coupled with the cardio boost you should be in good shape....BING......!the bonus would be the loss of man boobs...= )|`|ZY2GT7edaa	be persistent....results may be slow but it'll work...maybe up your cardio to 30-45 minutes and then do intense weight lifting....perhaps get a gym membership....? plus remember protein builds muscle and carbs such as cheerios aren't really good breakfast foods. try to up your protein intake, lower the carb intake, but still have lots of veggies and minimal fruit (cause it still has sugars!) if you get a craving for something, chew on gum.|`|aEeloKicaa	try to keep in mind your still growing ! boys bodies stop growing around the age of 21, and you rarely see a 21 year old with "man boobs" lol unless they are overall chubby themselves. keep doing what your doing, and have patience. in time your body will tone itself up.|`|nxzPUrHKaa	Mate, You're 14.<br>  <br>  I can remember those days.<br>  <br>  Ok, heres a few tips.<br>  <br>  Drop the 20min Cardio before your workout.<br>  instead do 5mins, enough to get the blood pumping.<br>  <br>  Alterate you weight training days, with Cardio.<br>  <br>  Eg, Because you are 14, you need to be lifting correctly, but allowing enough time for your body to grow.

It will show you everything from what exercises you have done to how much you have lifted.<br>  I have only been doing it in the last 2years, n I can honestly say, Im in better shape because of it!<br>  Its a Diary, you DEFINATELY need!!!<br>  <br>  Now the key here is not the lifting in the gym, but the Cardio.<br>  <br>  Sprint Training.<br>  <br>  look at this chart Carefully<br>  <br>  Minutes       Intensity (Percentage of maximum effort)<br>  1                    50 (Warm Up)<br>  2                    50 (Warm Up)<br>  3                    60<br>  4                    70<br>  5                    80<br>  6                    90 <br>  7                    60<br>  8                    70<br>  9                    80<br>  10                  90<br>  11                  60<br>  12                  70<br>  13                  80<br>  14                  90<br>  15                  60<br>  16                  70<br>  17                  80<br>  18                  90<br>  19                  100<br>  20                  50 (Cool Down)<br>  <br>  Now as you can see, for the first couple of minutes, you are warming up, then you are increasing the intensity to 60% and then the next minute up to 70% n so on.<br>  <br>  all you need to do is Cardio for 20mins.<br>  <br>  Consume a diet, higher in Protein.<br>  Because you are young, you'll be able to eat anything n everything n be able to burn it off.<br>  But if you eat Healthier than most then you'll lose more than most.<br>  <br>  For your info.<br>  <br>  When your body Processes food, it wants to eat Carbs n Fats first.<br>  So if you only feed your body Protein, it will still want those Carbs n Fats.

BylAxQOGaa	Unfortunately tantechrissie just going on a diet doesn't help with weight gained from birth control.  I've been off my hormonal birth control for two months.  I've been watching what eat very carefully as well as exercising and I haven't lost ONE OUNCE of the 20 pounds I gained in the four months I've been using it.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Unfortunately it is exactly the same as any other weight gain when it comes to losing it.    Healthy eating and a good brisk walk every day will put you on the right path.    Absolutely forbidden is chocolate, cheese or junk foods.    No sodas either.    With a healthy eating and exercise programme you should lose at least 1lb a week.   If that doesn't happen you could start a more rigorous diet, but slow but steady is better.
AKfZDADmaa	Your hair grows thicker and thicker as you grow. You might be a little sick But i do not think it is. It depends on what the symptoms are. If you have bad coughing or head ache it may be sickness. But if you do not have any of that stuff it is just because your growing. There are points that your hair grows thick fast and their are points were your hair becomes thicker fast. My hair has gotten much thicker as i grow older.<br>  It is just because you are growing.|`|bES0ltC8aa	ummm it might help but then again it could jus be ur shampoo|`|AfhqGA1kaa	OK so my grama and sister used biotin when this happened to her...my sis is 17 too and  she has thick hair now!you can get it over ther counter at like wal-mart and target or maybe kmart|`|u8CJFHPcaa	you have better to<br>  I think the problem may be your shampoo
C306HcKbaa	there are little hairs in your nose and when something gets inside (dust, another hair, etc.) your body's reaction is to sneeze in order to get the foreign object out. you can put your finger over your nostrils to try and prevent to sneeze from occurring... but this only works about 50% of the time.|`|29hxVukYaa	Its usually dust or something moving in your nose which hits a "trigger" and causes you to sneeze. There is really no way around this so you just have to sneeze.
etV271ARaa	So you missed a period. Could be the lexapro. Could be something random and harmless. Dont worry. I have grown up daughters and it watching them grow was the best time of my life but they had so many problems with their periods etc but eventually they all went away. Dont worry too much about it. Its probably harmless|`|xreWOKBYaa	yes, that could do it!|`|FQxUpc9baa	yes that could b it or it could just be changing my it self
TCpTlCTRaa	If the breakage is very close to the scalp it could be ringworm. Ringworm, also known as tinea capitis can cause hair to break off very close to the scalp which can cause a bald spot. If it is ringworm, a form of fungus, It can be treated with tea tree oil.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Never heard that one.|`|t36Dce0Laa	Nope.|`|drK7vxEvaa	me neither
RCfc9hMKaa	Yes. It's OK to take a sick day when you don't feel well, and I don't see why you can't still go... You just have to pay to get in now. Feel better and don't worry about it!|`|0QEJIk0Gaa	I know the feeling. It's hard to just stop everything, but it's important to take care of yourself. I'm so used to doing everything for other people, it's hard when I get sick to be dependent on others, but it is important to rest. You're sick, you need to take care of yourself right now and forget about the rest of the world.
I1mhB3Zgaa	Make sure he smokes outside so second hand smoke won't hurt anyone in house. Encourage him to quit because of his health. Look up on computer how many deaths there are a year smoke related. Its so high. Get him educational material to help. Ask him to do it for you. There are enough things against us in this World to spend the money to buy trouble.|`|IUw0f5u5aa	Make sure he smokes in the garden - you are just as much at risk as he from passive smoking, he is being very selfish, ask him to think of you even if he does not give a f--- about himself.   I would hate to suck on an ashtray.|`|HS7qRRiWaa	If your hubby won't quit for the obvious reasons then you'll have to deal with it. Of course it is not healthy but he must want to quit, nagging him about it will only make it worse. As far as bad for the environment, that's a stretch.|`|AA12044809	Here's a true story and you can show him this if you want. <br>  <br>  A good friend of mine had a husband who owned two parrots. Her husband smoked. Then one day her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer. He passed away. She was alone in her house doing some dishes and kept hearing what sounded like her husband cough. Just for a quick second she kept thinking that it was her husband and then realized it was the parrots. She recalls that he sat in front of them for 20 years and watched tv, chained smoked cigarettes , drank whiskey and coughed. That is what she remembers about her husband everyday. Not fond memories, just the coughing from the birds which remind her everyday of how selfish he was.
0fe8214b030dd7de007c637233de5a4daa	Ok I am assuming your grandfather has a cath. bag since your mother and you know about the blood or he wears adult diapers.  I have worked hemodialysis over 10yrs.  Yes there is a name for blood in the urine called hematuria and it is always a symptom and not the problem itself.  It can be be nerve wreaking cause it looks like more then it is. Blood shows really easily in urine so it looks like more then it is.  It is something to go to the Dr. about.  Usally nothing serious. Could be a number of factors that your Dr. can easily test for and be able to tell the cause.  It could be as simple as missplacement of the cath(if he has one) to a stone.  So calm down take a breath and go to the Dr.  I know you love him but try not to worry about as hard as that may be.|`|oojO4WAraa	Good thing he is going to the doctor.  Maybe it is just a bad bladder/kidney infection, maybe it is something more serious.  Going to the doctor is the only way to know for sure.  Good luck.  Hope everything turns out okay for him.|`|46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	I wouldn't be going to the doctors I would be going staright the the emergency room/ A&E|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	could be anything- and also depends on where you live. Some tropical parasites are a possibility (schistosoma) also kidney/ bladder stones, some infections and tumours. Might also be an injury or some chemical rinsed from the body.<br>  <br>  Either way- no way of telling on sight alone. He needs a urine exam, possibly a urine culture (bacteria, etc) prostate exam. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen would be a big plus. An X-ray too- but only if the ultrasound shows anything.<br>  Full blood picture, Urea, Creatinine and PSA levels, also bleeding factors|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Haematuria (blood in urine) can be down to quite a few factors and requires investigation. Those factors include a bladder or kidney infection, but try not to worry, he'll be seen and treated pretty quickly. <br>  <br>  Hope he gets well soon.|`|AA11103493	Could just be a bladder infection, or kidney stones or a cancer.  Try not to panic because it's more than likely a bladder infection that can be cleared up by antibiotics.<br>  Normal advice with blood in urine is to get to the doc asap.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Is he having any pain? That sounds like a kidney stone.|`|AA11222226	my mum had this, she hadnt had periods for years, suddenly she started passing blood whilse weeing, she had malignant warts in her bladder, they check her out every 6 months and remove them. best thing for you to do is try not to worry to much and make sure he gets checked out asap.|`|QCAJeDxzaa	It may be diverticulitis. It can happen as you get older. I have an aunt with it.  Tell him to cut down on eating anything with seeds (ex. strawberries) and nuts. A diet high in fiber is what is suggested.|`|713d09d4e24b6e6ced1f1de7fff7fc4aaa	Wait for the Drs report so you do not get all confused.  It might just be a vein which broke and emptied.   Don't panic, just be calm and cheerful for him on his return from the Dr.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	There could be any number of reasons.  Older men often suffer with problems relating to the prostate gland.  Hope he gets on OK at the Drs.<br>  <br>  x|`|6gPCA7jHaa	It could be caused by kidney stones.|`|lPXscuKSaa	Bye bye grandad|`|cMsC5a14aa	Not a doctor and i suggest you go see one right away
08Vk3RtJaa	it sounds like a peri-anal (meaning near the anus) abcess.  It could have started with something as simple as a pimple or in-grown hair follicle which has become infected.  See your doctor and he will probably give you anti-biotics to clear it up.  Try not to squeeze or pop it as this will open it up to further infection. Be sure to take the full course of anti-biotics as this will ensure the infection is totally cleared up and less likely to reoccur.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	It could be a number of things. It sounds to me like it's either a boil or a hemorrhoid. Most likely a hemorrhoid.You should get it checked by a doctor. An open sore that close to your anus can lead to infection. Good luck!
sVaKQxtGaa	I'm not sure of the cause, but you should visit an eye doc. He or she will likely advise you to get vision therapy/vision training. It just means your brain is not in sync with your eyes.
8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|AA10352420	To some extent they are good But if you really want better options then choose the  natural food items ( no sugars, no salt and additives etc|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Read the ingredients on the pack. If any flavours, colours or other additives (usually will have a number for a name) are present then this is not healthy. These things are toxic to the liver and the end result is lower fat burning function. Read more below if you want to learn about effects on your liver.|`|TGHNc1kHaa	Yes they are good, better than crisps and chocolate. However, be careful of the sweeter snack a jacks such as the caramel and popcorn as they are very sugary.|`|hRV18njLaa	You don't know until you look at the fat and salt content, cos most of the cheaper brands have more than the real brands.|`|rvjgwJwuaa	I think so and they are most definately better than crisps would be.<br>  <br>  The boring answer is eat grapes or fruit when you need to snack though!|`|UjSBk8LCaa	yes in moderation
WOHc22Xiaa	Could be from sucking on the cough drops so much.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	What type of cough drops did u take?Are u sure u dont have some kind of allergic reaction to them?Its possible that they arent frm a good company or that u have used them so often that they have affected ure mouth.STOP the cough drops go to the dentist and explain ure predicament,and take the cough drops with you to show him what u have been taking.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	WE<<< can not help you.  But your doctor can.  I suggest seeing them NOW.  But its probably irritation from all the cough drops and then it probably got infected.|`|791369017fd575cf3f0e23a2ea22a6a3aa	You might have cold sores.|`|hdBMsEbnaa	It sounds like canker sores.. They can be red or white. Swish with warm salt water 2-3 times a day.
YQuRVHl9aa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, many people would declare impossible, nevertheless the sole diet which definitely worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Fox News and CNN. I lost 20 pounds, it definitely does work!
uKFgRHeqaa	your contacts might be old. or you could have an infection. in either case its best to see an eye doctor
uJKTR4d2aa	only way is to keep on exercising. your body will take it off once you lose more weight|`|8SRjELNBaa	Keep up the weight loss buddy!<br>  <br>  As you keep slimming down you'll look better in the mirror & your waist trimmer can go in a "Good Will" bag.
KOYC3XkJaa	When there is no broken skin, open wounds, or blisters. Then you can use makeup.<br>  For the moment, you're unfortunately just going to have to deal with it. As tempting as it may be, do not break the blister. That will make it take longer to heal and open you up to infection.<br>  If I were you I would go to the doctor's. Burns tend to scar quite a bit, and you don't want that, especially since it's on your face. The doctor can also give you some prescription medication (ie silver sulfidiazine) to help heal your burn faster.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	steffi is that you?<br>  <br>  read some of the comments on this video many good recommends<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvc2sq7cTHQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvc2sq7cT...</a>|`|wObFm9B4aa	don't use make up u freaking idiot<br>  thats what you want a nice staff infection on your FACE

You'll have 5 years to think what you want to do with your life- and all your life before you.<br>  Drugs will give you an hour's "rest" then all hell will break loose. And if you repeat it- your life (as you know it) ends.<br>  <br>  So use your head|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I know a lot of people who take drugs and the moment you do take drugs you mite just as well give up your life as it will mess your life up good and proper taking drugs is a no win situation the only people that win are the drug dealers.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Well, as a health educator, I will provide you with a decision making model, because in the end, it is your decision. How many people on here tell you you should or shouldn't isn't really going to make up your mind for you. You already know that drugs are terrible for your body, but can make you temporarily feel good. And you also know that this can lead to addiction and possibly ruin your life or cut it short.<br>  <br>  So first of all<br>  <br>  1. Identify the problem: I am under a lot of pressure<br>  <br>  2. Decide possible alternatives:<br>  -drugs<br>  -video games<br>  -finding new friends<br>  -anything else YOU can think of, I don't know you personally<br>  <br>  3. Evaluate each alternative:<br>  (here you list pros and cons for each alternative)<br>  Again, I don't know what is going through your mind, so you have to answer this part yourself<br>  <br>  4. Act out plan/decision<br>  <br>  5. Learn from the experience.<br>  <br>  Maybe you pick one alternative (drugs) and learn that it isn't all it is cracked up to be, then you can always change your mind (unless of course you try hardcore drugs first and become instantly addicted and end up dieing before you can make a new choice -hah, sorry for the scare tactics)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with making your decision!<br>  <br>  Drugs are really only a temporary cure for a long term problem...|`|Uj6sVcJKaa	Its not gona solve your problems. <br>  Its just gona give you another thing to worry about. <br>  It's wayyyy better to try to work things out w/ your parents and those two friendships. <br>  I choose to do drugs as a way out and it sucks.|`|Wsa7yvqNaa	Ecstasy+alcohol maybe a little bit of acid on the side|`|rVPrhd26aa	smoke lots of crack and shoot up daily that's what all the cool are doing... you are cool right? ;)|`|FC2Kdo29aa	don't turn to drugs in hard times babe, that's the easiest way to develop a habit for them that's hard to break.<br>  <br>  if you really do want to do drugs sometime in the future, do it because you're content and you just want to know what it feels like, not because you want to escape from all the stress in your life.<br>  <br>  the easiest thing to do in the situation where you're surrounded by stress is to withdraw from people for a while. focus on your studies and start finding a hobby that will help you release your stress, i.e. painting writing or drawing, ofr if something physical would be better, kickboxing or karate. there are many things besides drugs that you can do to relieve stress.<br>  <br>  once again, don't ever turn to drugs when you're sad, pissed off, depressed, or any other negative emotion. some drugs may effect these feelings in negative ways and get you in a shitload of trouble. try drugs if and when you're ready, but not now because of all the stress.<br>  <br>  hope i helped <3|`|upwwspFIaa	Go to an N/A or A/A meeting. Or find new friends. Talk to your parents as hard as that might be. I know that the things I just listed probably seem ridiculous but Im serious. You sound like you have addictive behavior. Reaching for drugs in times of stress or under pressure is a really bad thing. It means your coping skills are not to good. This is a perfect recipe for an addict. Take it from me I was on heroin for 10 years and I am now finally living drug free. I started out the same as you and feeling like you. And it took me down a very long hard road that you want no parts of. Trust me. A drug craving only lasts 15 minutes. So if you resist that long it will subside. Now it will come back and that's why you need to reach out to people who are just like you. There are tons of Narcotics Anonymous meeting everywhere. And there are now young people meetings so you dont have to sit around with a bunch of lame old people listening about the good ol' days. If you look online you will find the 800 number for N/A and they will give you all the spots near you that you can go and get some advice and possibly help. Going doesn't mean you ARE an addict or a bad person, loser or anything like that. You might even meet some REAL friends there. Drugs aren't cool neither is drinking. And remember if you lay down with dogs, you will come up with fleas. Good luck|`|Y0DugutZaa	dont do it is not worth it you'll mes up everything even more, plus they are depressants and will make you more depressed.<br>  <br>  if you start you might not stop and u dont want that, ditto for using alcohol. i spent 6 months in a rehab (for depression) but everyone else were either alcoholics or drug addicts, you dont want to go there, i have never seen so much human misery in one place, what some did for drugs and the things they did on drugs was truly frightening, please dont try drugs.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Wont help you any but taken in moderation they can be fun
08Vk3RtJaa	if the blood is bright red it is probably a small tear in your anal passage which can easily happen if you are straining on the toilet.  Pain killers can often cause constipation and hard stools which are difficult to pass.  If that is the case your problem ease when you stop the pain killers, in the meantime drink plenty of water and take a mild natural laxative if you are very constipated.  If you are passing black coloured stools you could have a bleed higher up in your bowel and this should be checked immediately, but if this is the case you would not actually notice any bright blood when you clean yourself after using your bowels.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	red blood in the stool is from a fissure (crack) in the rectum or hemmorioids.... nothing to be concerned over unles it continues after you've cleaned off and gone about your day.....straining causes it... or heavy coughing, can , too.... or having a lot of peanuts pass thru.....|`|AA10727113	Blood in your stools is never a good thing.  If it was bright red it could be something like a tear on your anus or a lesion on your colon.  If it was more dark or like coffee grounds it would be a bleed further up in the intestines.  Either way you need to go into the ER.  Knew someone who lost 3/4 of their blood volume without even knowing it through his stool.|`|6mOOskuBaa	Don't waste time on the computer. Go the the ER now!

The longest strep can live on household surfaces is 48 hours, a bit longer in confined and/or moist areas and up to 15 days on something that has had direct contect with the bacteria, such as a toothbrush.<br>  <br>  What seems more feasible is that perhaps your daughter's strep hadn't resolved completely (many times, unless you stand there and watch your children take their medication, they won't take it) or she may be a carrier.|`|DMhAPurkaa	More probable that they both were in contact with the bacteria<br>  It is Strep season<br>  MY son just had it and the nurse said the municpal water had a bacteria count too high and it was being coerrected, but she wondered if that was why they were treating so many lately<br>  My son just had it.<br>  It starts with a sinus infection sometimes and the post nasal drip comes in contact with the throat <br>  Strep is bacterial <br>  however they use antibiotics to treat the infection<br>  Was grandma changing her toothbrush regularly, or better yet<br>  microwaving or dishwasher ing it or soaking it in antibacterial solution, such as hydrogen peroxide/water solution; or Listerine solution?<br>  She could have picked it up on her hands from anyone or on a surface<br>  you just don t know.
f2XhfAoIaa	Eating badly for one day isn't going to make you gain weight.
mAZi1eH7aa	As long as you are eating balanced meals as well. If a liquid diet is the mainstay of your diet, then what food you eat will be stored as fat, instead of proper discharge. It would have the opposite effect to what you want. Just avoid sugars. Skip the splenda (it is no different than sugar / just advertising / your body does not require extra sugar) and use Stevia instead. It is actually good for you and has no calories.<br>  Avoid all junk foods and avoid anything deep fried. Avoid soft drinks. Drink milk and unsweetened juices.<br>  There is no miracle. It just takes smart eating and 3 meals a day and being active. No great exercise routine is required. Just be active. Walk. Swim. Take the stairs. Have fun. The weight will soon drop off.|`|qNLnXfcpaa	sure and if you drink alot of water before eating it will make u stuff faster and you wont eat as much.

It's something I read about a few months ago. I think I have it too, I have this bumps on my upper arm that are the color of my skin, but they sometimes look like acne. It's just because your body creates too much of a certain protein, causing those bumps. That's the only thing that it causes, it really doesn't do anything else. There are treatments, but if it is Keratosis Pilaris, it'll probably go away on its own.

KAwYumFfaa	Your are right, that is the muscle in your neck. Probably u sprained it without noticing what you have done. There is no need to panic in there okay? Has it been days since that pain has occurred? So, there is no need for you to put on the ice. Instead, luke warm water. That should do, coz cold remedy should only be done the first 24 hours, past that should be warm. Try putting on some patch with menthol in it. That should also increase the blood flow to the muscles in your neck. Also, you might wanna splint your neck to minimize the movements so to decrease healing time. That should do the trick..  :)

5wqjStm3aa	Heroin is an illegal, highly addictive drug. It is both the most abused and the most rapidly acting of the opiates. Heroin is processed from morphine, a naturally occurring substance extracted from the seed pod of certain varieties of poppy plants. It is typically sold as a white or brownish powder or as the black sticky substance known on the streets as "black tar heroin." Although purer heroin is becoming more common, most street heroin is "cut" with other drugs or with substances such as sugar, starch, powdered milk, or quinine. Street heroin can also be cut with strychnine or other poisons. Because heroin abusers do not know the actual strength of the drug or its true contents, they are at risk of overdose or death. Heroin also poses special problems because of the transmission of HIV and other diseases that can occur from sharing needles or other injection equipment. Heroin is usually injected, sniffed/snorted, or smoked. Typically, a heroin abuser may inject up to four times a day. Intravenous injection provides the greatest intensity and most rapid onset of euphoria (7 to 8 seconds), while intramuscular injection produces a relatively slow onset of euphoria (5 to 8 minutes). When heroin is sniffed or smoked, peak effects are usually felt within 10 to 15 minutes. Although smoking and sniffing heroin do not produce a "rush" as quickly or as intensely as intravenous injection, NIDA researchers have confirmed that all three forms of heroin administration are addictive.<br>  <br>  According to the 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which may actually underestimate illicit opiate (heroin) use, an estimated 2.4 million people had used heroin at some time in their lives, and nearly 130,000 of them reported using it within the month preceding the survey. The survey report estimates that there were 81,000 new heroin users in 1997. A large proportion of these recent new users were smoking, snorting, or sniffing heroin, and most (87 percent) were under age 26. In 1992, only 61 percent were younger than 26.<br>  <br>  The 1998 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), which collects data on drug-related hospital emergency department (ED) episodes from 21 metropolitan areas, estimates that 14 percent of all drug-related ED episodes involved heroin. Even more alarming is the fact that between 1991 and 1996, heroin-related ED episodes more than doubled (from 35,898 to 73,846). Among youths aged 12 to 17, heroin-related episodes nearly quadrupled.<br>  <br>  Heroin was mentioned most often as the primary drug of abuse in drug abuse treatment admissions in Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, Newark, New York, and San Francisco.<br>  <br>  plz call his number 1-800-251-9445<br>  <br>  they will help|`|W7DKw3oOaa	there r drug hotlines too call or tell someone u trust and have them talk to u|`|AA10827567	When he/she has the stuff on them, call the police.

KAX9FURMaa	A brown vaginal discharge is a sign of blood (or dried up old blood). If you have just started taking the BC pill i don't think it is anything to worry about. But if you have been taking the BC pill for more the 2-3 months, i would recommend you go see your doctor to get it investigated. If you are on the hormone pill (not the placebo) you should not have any bleeding.<br>  <br>  Although, try not to worry, sometimes hormones run amuck, which can cause things like abnormal discharges.

Y5FyAekkaa	Just like anywhere else on your body with skin you can develop either infected hair follicles or acne that can lead to embarrassing bumps, even larger ones. However since you say that they are fairly frequent you need to wonder about STDs like genital warts. If you are not sexually active then you should check with a gyno. I don't know ur family situation but if you need some inexpensive or even free advice check with your local planned parenthood.  They do more than just birth control and can give you an exam. Also i have had lots of luck on WebMd figuring out potential health concerns.  Genitals in both males and females can do very funny things and lots of time its of no big concern. Take the leap though and get in touch with someone who can perform an exam. Better safe than sorry.|`|GpFqItSvaa	I know, it sounds crazy.<br>  really crazy.<br>  SUPER crazy.<br>  but...<br>  you need to tell your dad.

You could have a vaginal infection, and it might be serious, so crazy as it sounds...<br>  tell your dad.|`|GkYsmunZaa	If you are sexually active, it could be a sexually transmitted disease.  <br>  <br>  Another possibility is that they could be pimples.  Basically, you can get pimples anywhere on your body, and if you are not washing down their properly, or it gets a lot of sweat from working out or sports, you could be irritating that area or getting ingrown hairs.  <br>  <br>  I know it might not be comfortable, but you need to tell your dad.  If you are embarrassed to tell him exactly what it is, ask him if you can go see a doctor because you are worried about "some feminine issues".  Or tell you are afraid you might have an infection down there and would like to go to the doctor.  I'm sure he will understand.  <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario, is there a female nurse at school that you can ask to speak to?  <br>  <br>  Don't worry - I'm sure it will all be fine!|`|enW5Iai0aa	well you should get an ultrasound. thats what you should do. in the mean time if you cantwait any longer, do your own pre-test. <br>  <br>  this is called transillumination test, use a flashlight that is bright and shine it through your skin through the lumps. look for dark stains(the lumps will be pretty dark) or heavy/dense looking material.  that is looking for cancer/tumor. a cyst will just be lightly shaded, or semi translucent. so you will tell the difference if its a tumor or just a little cyst, which is benign.  the cyst is light and evenly shaded, the tumor is dark and (blotchy) <br>  <br>  now since its spreading or multiplying than it could be an STD but im not sure i want to put that idea into your head.. just make sure to check with a doctor, get there soon. <br>  <br>  could be something simple like pimples, just clean!!<br>  <br>  good luck, i hope you good health, and good results from your doctors visit(S).  follow up if you can, i'd like to know the results!! :)|`|rK61Oabxaa	I know telling your dad might seem like the WORST idea.<br>  But it is the BEST idea!!<br>  You need to tell him, you mgiht need to go to a doctor and get it checked out.<br>  You don't want it to turn into something worse.<br>  && HAHAHAHA You thought you were growing testicles wow LOL.<br>  Yeah,<br>  Good luck[:<br>  Hope this helps.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	do you shave? could be an ingrown hair.<br>  <br>  <br>  could be a pimple, you get them everywhere.<br>  <br>  <br>  do you have a sex life? could be an STD or an STI.|`|4ku0wasbaa	It could just be hormones and the lumps are just filling up with fluid and that would explain their  changing size.  It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to your doctor about them though.  good luck and sorry to hear about your mom :(
iQLYRzRUaa	just take like 6+ benadryl <br>  makes you really sleepy though|`|Zg4Wfjnnaa	lol.<br>  ive been in that same place, we looked it up on a few sites.<br>  we ended up buying a bad up shelled peanuts, peeling them.. and tryin to smoke them<br>  it did nothing.<br>  <br>  my best alternatice.<br>  nutmeg.<br>  make it into a tea.<br>  ground some up.. grate it.<br>  it taste feral.<br>  its not the best feeling..<br>  but its not sober.<br>  its gets you really dead.. and you kinda feel stoned.<br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=17568" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.ph...</a><br>  <br>  have fun :)|`|2Ov1k6Reaa	no no no no no no, don't put anything in your bong. Instead, put your bong in your ***.|`|W5AWUOm0aa	an aa card maybe. sounds like you have a problem
a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Isn't expired nyquil....   Dayquil?<br>   Hope you feel better.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	No it just wont work as well, get off the couch and get some new meds, if it's really so bad you can't take yourself to the drug store then get to a doctor.|`|AA12290249	you're stupid, sorry.<br>  <br>  **haha i'm sorry, but if it's expired, you really should just try your best to get ahold of a friend or family member ha ha.<br>  <br>  if i was that sick, i'd just try to sleep it off or w/e and do what helps, instead of taking something i'm not sure about ha ha.<br>  <br>  but i'm sorry. there's your sympathy. **|`|oyvRHQmaaa	It won't hurt you,..It just might not be as effective as fresh medicine would be....|`|IWzYB44raa	LOL  *smooch*   poor baby|`|2lakZBgiaa	yes, your gonna get astropostrophe, and die painfully, first the decaying nyquil will start with your toes, slowly eating them from the inside, soon enough your toes will get numb and turn blue, it'll start moving up from there, sucks for us cause, it doesn't skip you dick, so you're gonna loose that too, then once it gets to the heart, you start coughing out blood and peeing outta your ***, then, its just pure hell from there. you can't breath, you wanna cry but you cry out nothing! then you just stop breathing and eventually, die in a slow and painful way.<br>  good luck!|`|bPDQUYU9aa	I would think it would just lose potency, but definitely call poison control if you're seriously concerned or if you feel weird
IWzYB44raa	I have taken expired medicine before and it didn't hurt or kill me.  The only thing I noticed is that it wasn't as strong as it would have been if it had been new.  I would take it.  It's better than taking nothing!<br>  <br>  You won't die!  I promise!  If so, I would have died myself many times over.|`|KHFehqzyaa	No. It's one thing if it's a day or two past the expiration, but over-the-counter medicines are usually really old by the time they reach the expiration date anyway...up there with batteries.<br>  <br>  If by any chance you have a drugstore that delivers (or know someone who can pick it up for you) I would say make a phone call and have some brought to you.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Do not take the Nyquill. Do you have a friend or family member you can call to get you some?|`|25782c307317c0aaffde04836672cc50aa	How long ago did it expire?  If its over a year you should not take it.  But if its not that long ago, it might just have lost some of its potency.
0ectWZxAaa	the gel pills work so much better for me, because you don't have to taste the nastyness. I don't know if one is faster than the other tho.
DErZDyBQaa	Your muscles aren't just muscles, they are communicated through the nervous system. When you do an action that you haven't done in a while, you are weaker because your body is confused. Your body just adjusted to the bench pressing movement.<br>  <br>  Gj on getting sore, I love the feeling in the pecs ;)
3BfVbk5haa	First of all 155 five times so you did 5 sets of 5 reps or 3 sets of 5 reps with that kind of reps your making muscle mass adding more reps less weight is body toning , obviously your muscle hurt your lifting more then you can handle so your ripping a lot of muscles
cIuNyjUNaa	Make sure you clean your jewelry before inserting it, and clean the piercing several times a day. You could use something like an antibiotic cream for the piercing, and rubbing alcohol for the jewelry. Never share jewelry without cleaning thoroughly. Good Luck.|`|ukMzHgFdaa	put ointment on it, and dont wear shirts that will get caught to it.|`|y2XKYhsyaa	dont wear tight tight shirts. it rubs on the piercing and causes irritation.
WlZ66KnZaa	I lost about 40 pound so I know how you feel. A good way to lose is by following a 1200 calorie diet. I still sometimes eat when I am bored. When bored drink water and do a different task (exercising, computer, tv) Walkings good to start out with. Also jumping jacks or something fun like wii fit or dance dance revolution. Drinking water and getting enough sleep are very important. When stressed listen to music while on a walk. If you want I can help make a food plan for 1200 calorie diet that has plenty of food. this is an awesome site that will help- <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/" rel="nofollow">http://caloriecount.about.com/</a>
IuN3FwCKaa	Its always good to reward yourself. <br>  One thing about being skinny is giving into your cravings. There is no rule about not being able to have 1 serving of sweet a day. lol really just eat some ice cream just moderately|`|JLBuXqStaa	in moderation, have about a cup<br>  <br>  you ate really healthy today and ran for 30 minutes, reward yourself! just dont go overboard<br>  <br>  you seem to be off to a good start, congrats and good luck! :]|`|RKtQAAxxaa	yes. eat it. Ice cream is the best!!
4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	If you cut back your intake of fatty foods and salty foods you should be okay. If you exersize properly you can eat what ever you want but at a moderate style. I am walking in the mornings and doing stomach crunches, drinking more water (with those packets that you can add flavor no carbs no sugar), I cut my soda intake and lost 15 lbs automatically.<br>  <br>  For some people losing weight is like a job you hate b/c you have to work at it hard to get what you want.<br>  <br>  GL and I hope you do get to where you want but sensibly :)|`|aEeloKicaa	wow im impressed that someone so young thought of a healthy weight loss plan. your plan sounds way better then most of the adults out there lol. your plan will definatly work if you stick to it. <br>  if you eat a little junk food now and then after may i dont think it will cause you to gain your 15 lbs back. if you stay active and eat right, with junk food only sometimes, then you should be in good shape.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>   to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis this calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

I8lFqyyFaa	These are 2 separate problems.  For the vaginal one, I'd go see the Dr.  The smell might indicate something like BV (bacterial vaginosis.)  There's no way of knowing without an exam.  The Dr can also smell what you're smelling that way and can tell you if it's normal or not.  Unless it's not your vagina, since you describe it as your underwear, and it's really just musky crotch sweat.  In that case, try breathable cotton underwear and clothes, and some powder.<br>  <br>  Your teeth - brushing isn't enough.  Make sure you're flossing every day.  And when you do brush, don't miss doing your tongue too.  Dry mouth can really make your breath bad too (don't be a mouth breather.)  Mouthwash like listerine is alcohol based and can make your mouth dryer, and your bad breath even worse, actually.  There are non-alcohol mouthwashes you can try if you use them, and other things like sugar-free candies you can suck on to keep your mouth from drying out too much.  If your mouth is getting too dry all the time, think about what might be causing it.  Are you on any drugs, or maybe dehydrated?  I also get bad breath any time I get a sinus/nose thing going on, like a cold, but it passes with the cold.  Some people have post nasal drip more regularly, like with allergies, that can affect their breath.  Get rid of the sinus drippiness, get rid of the smell, if that's your issue.|`|PTxaUkwKaa	It might be a yeast infection, if it's in your mouth, too. What do you mean by "wash", do you put soap around your vaginal area? That can cause infections. You shouldn't have to use soap, just rinse the area with water. Whatever the case, see your doctor ASAP.|`|dHg78Phdaa	you got sum nasty **** wrong with you. GO see the vagina doctor and ave him stick sum **** in ya pussy and see whats poppin up in there.|`|4g1qMBDFaa	you need to see a doctor and let them some tests on you. I can suggest a douch and maybe that will help with the odour. Sometimes when you have a bad tooth in your mouth you can get a bad odour from that, my hubby had this a few time and let me tell you his breath was unbearable untill he got it fixed. You should get checked out in both cases, sorry i cant be of any more help
WRQMTLxjaa	Yes, I do get period cramps often, tylenol helps.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	Therma Care brand heat wraps makes a heating pad that adheres to the panel of your panties.  Up to 12 hours of blessed warmth to ease those cramps away.  You can wear it anyplace and no one will see it.  Of course, you have to wear your "grannie panties," but most of us do during our periods anyway.<br>  <br>  You also might want to find a pad you can live with using overnight.  If you are a tampon wearer it is better to flow more freely if you are cramping.  I know tampons do slow down my flow.|`|3OcR5eFraa	Try Midol! i have awful cramps with my period and it works wonders! I actually forget breifly throught out the day i have mine sometimes. they used to be so bad i couldnt stand sitting, my hips and legs hurt, it was awful. but midol is available at any drug store like rite aid or walgreens, cvs...etc..<br>  <br>  really try it! lol good luck =]|`|pvCz6z4uaa	Yeah, mine have gotten worse for me in the past year as well.  A few times they're doubling over in pain bad, and it happens at night w/ a little nausea.  I take ibuprofen as well which helps, and pepto bismol for the nausea.  Also, heating pads, warm baths/showers, or a hot water bottle are all good ways to help.  Just try to keep your mind off of them and relax.  You can always ask your doctor if he/she has any good ideas for them as well.<br>  <br>  and of course there's always curling up in a ball!! lol<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|l7Y8gg7iaa	I get them so bad that i am almost in tears most the time, if you lie on your side and put your legs up to your chest it might help. Or i usually just lay down with my pjs on and put the heating pad on my tummy, normally that takes care of it.|`|c8f41e7ef5a2e7310f5e27dfdf71c18baa	yes it usually hurts on the first day for me, i usually sleep it out and it goes away
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I have taken it several times to get a kick start cure for a yeast infection.  However, I always used Monistat 7 in conjunction with the pill to make sure that the infection went completely away.  I never really trusted the pill to cure the yeast without some other medicine to go with it.<br>  <br>  best wishes..
Q5hVEyfoaa	Way 2 go, sounds like you're on track. Keep up the good work:)|`|8SRjELNBaa	Sounds like you've got the right idea, we all had to start out at square one.  If you choose to, you can be more strict with your diet as you become more self-disciplined to the concept of a diet.<br>  <br>  Increasing the intensity if your cardio workouts will help boost results.  So will doing anything to maintain a high metabolism.  Theres tons of little tricks you can do for yourself to shed calories here or there. (Like eating spicy food).<br>  <br>  Stay focused, keep up the work.
fOfqPATaaa	You should talk to a professional sweetie=(
3buQDaRDaa	Standing long jump= good<br>  Bench= bad<br>  Squat= good
XKhNw221aa	No, look at Micheal Phelps.<br>  and plenty of other great athletes toke up from time to time|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Smoking is always bad. Yes, it will affect you because when you smoke you take in smoke so then it ruins your ability to run a lot without running out of breath. Quickly. I have a friend that used to play football he was an amazing quarterback, then he discovered weed and he can't run and play like he used to he had to quit football, and carries an oxygen tank around with him and he is only 17. So try to quit if you are. I hope this answers your question.|`|0H63P4jAaa	only if you smoke it before a baseball game haha.|`|HHuS48u5aa	yes....<br>  <br>  unless in extreme moderation.|`|HACa4Y74aa	Only if you smoke too much.|`|kXdXJKEMaa	ummm idk if it will effect u on the baseball field but u shouldnt smoke PERIOD|`|RUuQ3syDaa	are you serious? duh! why, did you think it was good for you?|`|aAZaqTpEaa	yeah...|`|2lakZBgiaa	all of these people are dumb asses, it only slows your reflexes when you are actually high, but when your not your fine, in fact, when im high i can run for soooo long and not get tired, its weird! and i know that its real cause i video taped me joggin around my neighborhood when i was high and watched it when i wasn't, and at the end of the jog i wasn't even breathing hard!|`|Zw35BW3zaa	I would think so, it is a toxin you introduce in your body, so I would figure it would cause physical damage probably to your lungs similar to smoking tobacco|`|VJ2O4akQaa	yes. it is just like smoking the regluar crap that you see in stores. but weed does a lot more to your health and all of your insides|`|cg5A0DsDaa	YES knumbskull.<br>  that's a silly question. didnt you finish high school?<br>  health class? or were you too "cool" and skipped those.... -_-|`|VCpZunivaa	weed..... hmmmm depends on how much you smoke, do ECSTASYYY only once a month n it won't damage ur brain, ull never go back to weed lol n it won't make you weak either just happy n lovable!|`|IfRh4sldaa	DUH! YES IT CAN|`|DXzUCgj8aa	yes  smoking cause u to run slower and shorter  cuz  it makes  u get out of breath faster|`|29hxVukYaa	yes definitely|`|pZ8evSJ0aa	Do you think that's a smart thing to do with all the drug testing now a days? Think about it.|`|DROjvDKlaa	probably yeah|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	I never thought it was bad|`|gUg1tjfcaa	yea... it damages your lungs which will make u cough more, WHICH will make u not run as fast etc...|`|6kA3TwZvaa	YEAH|`|SOxzD2Waaa	no.|`|IIIKFDOoaa	duh stupid, that can ruin your lungs and do you understand how terrible that is for your body???!!!|`|vyGyLV7paa	YES dont smoke.  if your coach finds out that u do you can get kicked off the team|`|qzqmXnLbaa	yes, its not as bad as smoking cigarettes but smoking weed is still smoking and damages your lungs to a smaller degree than cigarettes. It will also decrease your sperm count, give you stoner moments of short term memory loss and give you the munchies. now if you were trying to loose weight and could control yourself well, smoking pot will increase your metabolism and if you don't eat while high you will loose weight. Now i've also heard that if you smoke out of a vaporizer it does not hurt your lungs at all or as much. Just remember, it takes up two weeks for pot to leave your system and more depending on how much or how often you smoke.|`|U8lUcAj9aa	Definitely not. Smoking of any kind (week, pot, cigarettes, anything really) damages your lungs and puts you at risk of cancer so I wouldn't chance it. If you really want to improve in your performance I say practice, practice, practice. It's really the only way anyone can do to improve whatever they want too. So give it your all. ^-^|`|JnsdkOu6aa	Honestly all the people here are going to say that it will. <br>  But i'm going to straight up tell you. <br>  Nawww, it won't<br>  Maybe if you were like 80 years old. <br>  But if your young and already in shape. <br>  No. <br>  But cigarettes defiantly would.|`|tuGlMFdhaa	yes i think it can effect your performance that is if u do alot of it, or a little before you play but weed has never killed anybody and it is said to like be just as harmfull as tobbacco.|`|u4lS6C4eaa	Smoking anything is bad for your physical health. You are inhaling smoke deeply into your lungs. That's a dangerous thing to do. Period.|`|qqKJL16xaa	It has the same effect on the lungs as nicotine, so yes.  Weed also slows your physical responses and mental processes.|`|ed8c394758bb815b5025dbae82e638aeaa	no but its just stupid<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhAFF4veo7eWMik2a8lbKlQazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304092121AACJUDA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XGImYVpLaa	yes. <br>   weed slows down your mental abilitys to do everyday things- such as baseball ;;<br>  <br>  if you want to be a great player, than S T O P !!!|`|f38AJE6maa	only because it decreases your lung capacity. that's it, unless you're toking up directly before a game. that's stupid.|`|JyO8sBkuaa	ummmmmm yea of course it diminishes your physical abilities, and your brain.|`|tu81vdQWaa	ahahah woww dudee|`|7xJpfheZaa	yes, it will slow your reflexes. why, are you getting bored standing in the field?|`|w63hYc7saa	uhh...yeah!

So it depends how much you smoke.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	No, because baseball is an anaerobic sport, it does affect athletes that play football or run track or any other aerobic sports, but not baseball|`|AA11556445	New studies have suggested that smoking "weed" can actually cause testicular cancer in men.|`|Lkp4mfqHaa	not at all
tQYtebgEaa	Honestly, there's no way to really tell without seeing a professional. I'm not going to tell you to talk to someone because that's something that you need to decide how to approach on your own. I'm sure the vast majority of people here saying she should see a therapist or alert the authorities would never do that if they were in the situation, it's just easier to say the 'right thing' because the internet is so impersonal.  <br>  <br>  Sexual abuse can effect different people in different ways. I was also sexually abused and it has had close to no, if any effect on me.  A lot of times people want to make a big deal out of stuff like this and they will tell you that you have to be upset about it. Maybe she just isn't harboring any negative emotions over the situation. Trauma is caused by the way we react to a situation, not by the situation itself.<br>  Of course, there is always the possibility that it is greatly effecting her and she's only putting a smile on so that you don't worry. Or she may have subconsciously blocked out the emotional trauma that the molestation caused caused her. The best thing for her would probably be therapy, but I understand that that is a very personal and hard step to take.   You would be an absolutely amazing friend if you always, always offered a shoulder to cry on when she needs it.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	They need intensive counseling to help them. They will have major issues with their own sexuality, and 15 is too young to see how it manifests.<br>  <br>  Not until she is in a long-term relationship involving normal sexual relations would this issue come to light. It will cause an abnormal sex life, most likely disappointing to her man, and end in a bad break-up.<br>  <br>  Counseling is critical to this girl having a healthy sex life.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I was sexually abused for many years as a girl, and seemed ok. When I was 15, I started having crying jags and was inconsolable. At age 16, I poisoned myself & had to go to the hospital.  Sexual abuse is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a child, and the younger it started, the worse it will be. If a child is abused starting after the age of 12, they usually make a pretty solid recovery, I have read.  The fact that she was abused over many years means it is more likely she will have problems. Mental illnesses come on in a person's teens and 20's, when the brain is rewiring itself from a child brain into an adult brain.  There are HUGE changes in the brain during this time. This process finishes up at about age 25.<br>  <br>  The abuser needs to be reported to the authorities. It is very likely this person has abused other girls and damaged their lives also, and will continue to do so, until they are stopped by the authorities. Many abusers destroy dozens of people's lives. <br>  <br>  She probably does not realize how much the sexual abuse has damaged her. I am sure that it has.  For me, the only symptom until I was 15 was that I wet the bed every night. That didn't stop until I was 25 and read a book on sexual abuse that said bedwetting is a symptom - and the bedwetting stopped forever after that. It was nearly every night before.  Many people are in denial about how bad it is, or perhaps she is still living with her abuser, who has possibly moved on to other victims.<br>  <br>  I am 44 now, had a lot of therapy, and am still damaged by what happened.|`|kdSuwt8paa	People deal with things in different ways.    Some people can move on, accept that it happened, that it was not their fault and they have nothing to be ashamed off, and just get on with their lives.   I hope your friend is like that, and not just in denial.   Deep down she may still suffer and talking to a professional might ease her suffering, but only she can know that.   The very fact that she has told you is a positive sign.   When she is older and falls in love it may make her feel reluctant to have a physical relationship with someone.    She might need help then even if she feels ok for now.    The other thing is that she may feel that she doesn't want to pursue the matter legally but she might need advice about that.   If the person is still around are other children safe?   She might feel very guilty if she did nothing and then another little girl had to go through what she went through.    I think I would encourage her to talk to someone when she feels ready.    Has she talked to her mother about it?|`|xGI9z01Maa	Depends on the person.  <br>  <br>  You have to go through a healing.  If you don't heal, then you never get better.  Healing is different for everyone.  <br>  <br>  She need to read up on the healing process if she is unwilling to see someone.  And if she is always happy then that could be a sign that she is not and she is just trying to be normal.  But I don't believe that any one is completely "Normal".  Who put together what is "Normal"?  And were they actually "Normal" or where they just believing that they were "Normal"?|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	Yes, at some point it will affect her.

PMen0pvdaa	This is my husbands yahoo page but I am going to try to answer this the best I can.  It is worth it if you can stick with it.  It's just like any other diet though if you stop you gain the weight back.  I lost 23 pounds on the South Beach Diet just by using Agatston's books that I got at a discount book store for under $10.  I have gained about 10-12 pounds of that back just because I am the only one in my family that needs to lose weight and it is hard.  The books give you recipes and insight into how the diet works.  The first 14 days is to cleanse you of unhealthy cravings.  The first 14 days you avoid all fruit and fruit juices, all starchy foods like bread etc., and some dairy.  You can have sugar free jello and no sugar added fudgsicles in Stage 1 though and they are yummy.  You will eat a lot of salads the first two weeks.  Satge 2 you introduce some fruit and some bread into the diet slowly.  Stage 3 is adding even more but in moderation.  The diet is big on not starving yourself.  You have breakfast, mid morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner.  My favorite snacks include part skim mozzarella sticks, Laughing Cow Light Cheese, and nuts.  Hummus is also good but I don't like the store bought kind.  There are also some websites that have South Beach Diet recipes.<br>  <a href="http://www.southbeach-diet-plan.com/recipecollection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.southbeach-diet-plan.com/reci...</a><br>  Good Luck I hope I was of some help!<br>  Lisa

Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|q7c0ma4faa	Stick to 1250 calories a day. It's best to cut out the white processed breads and stick with wheat bread, pasta. Cut out the extra fats and stick with unsaturated fats, ex: olive oil. Don't eat fried foods, eat more fish and chicken. Don't forget salads and veggies!

Either way go to the doctor, even if he/she doesn't want to stitch they can give you steri-strips which are sticky strips used to hold wounds closed, they are very strong and will stay on even if wet and can last for about a week, this would give your wounds time to heal over.

Our bodies burn both fat and carbohydrates for energy, but carbs are used first. By drastically reducing carbs and eating more protein and fat, our bodies naturally lose weight by burning stored body fat more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Although it's undoubtedly the weight-loss claims -- and noted success stories -- that are selling the books, the Center for Complementary Medicine in New York (which Atkins founded) claims that most people follow the Atkins diet for weight maintenance, good health, and disease prevention.|`|ERCxeKhtaa	FIRST OFF LET ME TELL YOU,, THIS DIET WORKS!!<br>  <br>  <br>  okay. the thing with atkins is, you have to keep doing it. you have to make it your lifestyle. but hey, you can eat a TON of great food and keep a GREAT body!!! for the rest of your life!!<br>  <br>  I have just started the atkins diet, and i'm 14 years old. <br>  The Atkins diet is, you can only eat 20 carbs a day. and thats pushing it<br>  a little bit. but, you CANNOT eat over that much no matter what. <br>  <br>  you can eat a ton of great food like,, <br>  BACON<br>  EGGS<br>  BUTTER<br>  MAYONAISE<br>  LOWFAT KETHUP<br>  ANY KIND OF MEAT<br>  OLIVE OIL<br>  SUNFLOWER OIL<br>  BAKERS NO SUGAR CHOCOLATE (ITS BITTER BUT YUMMY)<br>  OLIVES<br>  MUSTARD<br>  SALAD, CELERY (ETC...)<br>  TEA<br>  COFFEE<br>  VODKA (AND A TON MORE ALCOHOL .....LOL)<br>  CHEESE<br>  WHIPPING CREAM..MMMMM :))<br>  SOUR CREAM<br>  CUCUMBERS<br>  PICKLES<br>  COTTAGE CHEESE<br>  CREAM CHEESE<br>  CINNAMON<br>  PEANUT BUTTER<br>  MACADAMIA NUTS<br>  ONION SOUP<br>  CHICKEN BROTH<br>  PEPPERS<br>  PLUMS<br>  FISH STICKS<br>  PUMPKIN AND SQUASH KERNALS<br>  SUNFLOWER SEEDS<br>  TOMATOES..........................<br>  <br>  and so much MORE!<br>  just no, breads, wheat, some fruit... and i think thats it.. no fatty food.<br>  <br>  and if one day you just can't take it, and go eat a cake.. it's okay... <br>  you just have to get back on the diet again.. but, you can't go doing that all of the time. <br>  <br>  you lose up to 14 pounds in 2 weeks. but you don't start losing anything until up about a week, then you start losing weight rapidly. <br>  YOU CANNOT CHEAT ON THIS DIET. <br>  your body goes into something called, ketosis. <br>  that means for a week your body has had no carbs, and you start dropping weight. <br>  <br>  like i said, you have to stick to this diet, or you'll gain the weight all back. <br>  <br>  you can eat when you feel like it. but try not to eat of boredom. <br>  calories don't matter in this diet. trust me. <br>  <br>  if you purchase the atkins diet book, they'll give you a ton of good recipes of things to make that have no carbs :)<br>  you can even make pizza!!<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|zaCagGRPaa	its where you eat no carbs at all. and it works for a while but then the minute you put carbs in your mouth you gain it all back. sorry. try weight watchers it worked 4 me

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	At your age, it is pretty easy. Just get active again, exercise every day - it can just be dancing for an hour or something else fun - and don't eat junk food. Stay away from caffeine, sugary foods, fried foods. Load up on fiber rich foods and fruits, veggies. The weight will come off easily.|`|etgjETFZaa	i used to be one of the people that could eat anything they wanted and still stay extremely skinny and never have to work out. im 15 now too and my body changed a lot last year and now i hav a bigger boned build and everything i eat affects me.  lol its sad.  anyway i have found working out is seriously key. try to run on the tredmill or do the elliptical for a half hour or hour. Also eat smaller portions and skip desert occasionally. try starting your lunch with an apple so you are not as hungry. do not try skipping meals or going a crzy diet because they can harm you in the long run. working out and eating a little less made all the difference. hope this helped!|`|mdudtx7zaa	It's normal to gain weight when you get into a bad habit like you did (you got lazy). Take things slow and set small goals for yourself. At first pick maybe 2 lbs a week, then maybe 4 lbs a week. Looks like you want to loose about 30 lbs or so. At 3 lbs / week, that's 10 weeks (which is about 2 1/2 months). Try to eat smaller portions and do some exercise along with that. This should be really doable for you. Even a small amount of weight change should get the guys looking at you again.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Rob|`|O4SgF5o2aa	change you diet, consume a lot fruits and vegetables instead of snack from refine sugar like biscuits and sweets, stop eating when you feel not hungry/do not eat until full, eat small meal 5 to 6 times a day better than large meal once a day.|`|1vfockYEaa	See a dietitian and do exercise!

dpgXzMenaa	One simple and cheap way to help with cramps (it's also the quickest, and the most convenient and natural) is having an orgasm by masturbating.   It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining.

Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible.

JdkPNBuYaa	Ginger always helps and also ginsing (you can chew it or brew it)  oranges only help when you haven't gotten the sore throat yet, but it might help if it isn't that severe yet.  Get LOTS of sleep.  This allows your body to rest and fight to make your throat better as well as rebuild the tissues there.  If you feel phlem in your throat get it ALL out take a cotton ball and sab the back of your throat slightly but dont make your self throw up.  also hydrate yourself with ONLY WATER water will really help so drink lots|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You need to go to the doctor if it is this severe instead of guessing and trying to self diagnose.

If its not strep throat it could be bronchitis, some people I know seem to get it this time of year. Normally, not all the time, the sore throat can last about a week, and the worst of it is around the third day. This is known as acute bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis, on the other hand, is a case of acute bronchitis, but it keeps coming back.  I would go to the doctor to see if they can put you on anti-biotics. Good luck!|`|FJpPCVTCaa	could try some oranges and ginger.
94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Hormonal and copper IUDs work in different ways. With a copper IUD, a small amount of copper is released into the uterus. This type of IUD does not affect  ovulation or the menstrual cycle. Copper IUDs prevent sperm from being able to go into the egg by immobilizing the sperm on the way to the fallopian tubes. If an egg does become fertilized, implantation on the wall of the uterus is prevented because copper changes the lining of the uterus.<br>  <br>  With hormonal IUDs, a small amount of progestin or a similar hormone is released into the uterus. These hormones thicken cervical mucus and make it difficult for sperm to enter the cervix. Hormonal IUDs also slow down the growth of the uterine lining, making it inhospitable for fertilized eggs.
AA10640653	Interesting question you might want to ask a plastic surgeon about it. I would think it is possible by trying to extend the clitoris into a small penis and still leaving the vaginal cavity intact. <br>  <br>  The penis probably wouldn't enlarge much and would probably be pretty much useless unless she took testosterone supplements,but then she would start growing a beard, excess body hair and things like that.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	No, a transplanted penis can't just sit there flopping as an ornament, it needs the mechanism behind it to cause erection at least, your g/f will not have that.<br>  You could both work on her clitoris, with manipulation and possibly piercing it can be made bigger and more sensitive, it is the nearest thing any female has to a penis!|`|fUKWTjjiaa	no
I8lFqyyFaa	Is there a reason that telling her it's for cramps and period regularity isn't working?  You can also use pills that reduce or eliminate the number of periods you're having.  Most women don't menstruate at all after their first few months on depo.  You can tell her you'd like to menstruate less, or that you're hoping it might help with mood swings.  But if you think she'd be upset at the idea you're having sex, you really don't want to see her reaction if you have to tell her you're pregnant.  So in the meantime, make sure you're using barriers - like condoms - with spermicides *every* time, and are aware plan B contraceptives are available if a condom breaks.  And don't wait for her to do all this for you.  Ask her if it's okay to make an appointment for the pills, and if she agrees, call yourself and make it.  You can do this if you're grown up enough to have sex - both the conversation with mom and the appointment making.  You've given her your reason why you want this, and she can accept the surface reason if she likes.  Be aware, most moms are no fools though.  You say "cramps" and she knows damn well "boyfriend" which is why she isn't going to jump to call the Dr herself.  But these decoy reasons allow you both a way to talk about what you need without confronting the actual situation if it's not comfortable for either of you.|`|uMlxKEbUaa	How old are you? If you're 16, in most states, you can get birth control without parent consent. <br>  <br>  Well, this is scary, but you might want to try to talk to her about it. Tell her that you aren't having sex yet, but you feel like you're getting close to a point that you might. Tell her that you're trying to be mature and responsible but you need her help in doing so. Tell her that you know there is a lot of teen pregnancy these days and you don't want to become a statistic. You might be surprised how she reacts. <br>  <br>  BUT if you feel like you absolutely can't talk to her about it. Use condoms until you're 16 and can get birth control without her consent. Remember to use the condoms correctly.|`|l7Y8gg7iaa	you can go to a planned parenthood clinic and they will give it to you for cheap of you dont make  money. and im pretty sure its confidential.

Q8m6BGKVaa	I'm quite sure, they can't.  In most states, chiropractors are not medical doctors.  amongst U.S. civilians (it's more strict in most other industrial countries), unless  someone is also a licensed nurse-practitioner or physician's assistant working under the license of an M.D. they may not dispense medications at all, and certainly no controlled substances.|`|9olha1dKaa	No. Chiropractors do not prescribe controlled prescription medications, non-controlled prescription medications, or OTC medications.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Most cannot.

Some days it's all the way up to my thighs.  If I elevate my legs at night by the time I get to work they're back swollen.  My blood test and blood clot tests came back normal.  I don't have much pain associated with the swelling but if I press down hard on my ankles (which I did a few times just to see what would happen) it hurts a little.  The doctor is still running tests but I think it may be a circulation problem.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	um most likely that is a sign of fluid overload, dvt, or even heart failure.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	2 weeks will not make all that much difference towards your progress.  Remember also that the inflammation stage involves more than just swelling, there are a lot of chemical things going on as well.  I agree with the physician's decision to wait. <br>  <br>  There is some evidence that a course of PT can be beneficial prior to surgery, but I doubt two weeks would make that much difference.  <br>  <br>  You might also be having unrealistic expectations about returning to football this fall. Most surgeons want you to wait at least 6 months prior to return to sports and this would be pushing it a little...especially if your sport is football as opposed to a non-contact sport.  You need to have this discussion with your surgeon.|`|5KNUCGHtaa	The thing that sucks about this kind of surgery is that you can't get impatient. I was on the same boat as you i tore my acl and meniscus in football but it was my senior year and i missed out on cross country and track too. He wants you to wait two weeks so the inflammation will go down inside your knee even though it seems like the swelling has gone down from the outside. You should definitely be doing physical therapy before surgery because once you have surgery you will suffer from major muscular atrophy(you will lose a lot of muscle in your leg), and doing this will strengthen these muscles so you won't have such a hard strengthening them post-surgery. I suggest riding a stationary bike and your athletic trainer should have some exercises for you do to on a table to strenghten the muscles that support your knee. This injury sucks and just remember be patient and you have a long road of therapy ahead of you but don't let that discourage you. Good Luck with your surgery!

AA11155064	You've asked a big question with little information to work with.<br>  <br>  There can be a multitude of explanations; some can be physical, psychological, environmental, health, technique or age related among others.<br>  The fact you mention a statistic in relation to your experience, suggests you have some knowledge or have researched the situation to some extent. As with most things in life, some -- not all -- advice received will be useful. You will have to do your own in-depth research.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions to consider:<br>  1) What is orgasm to you? People vary, responses vary, experiences vary. Not everyone will feel orgasm the same -- and very few as Hollywood portrays it. Find what you understand orgasm to be: be ready to recognise it --and don't squander the chance expecting <br>  <br>  2) Relax. Don't stress expecting experience with immediacy. Like life, few things respond readily to urgency: stressing only inhibits perfection possibility. Like love and most happiness's, surprise is the element that gives value.<br>  <br>  3) Masturbate regularly. If you are unfamiliar with your own body and it's responses, how will you know what works to give pleasure? Finding out what doesn't give pleasure or makes dis-pleasure is a plus on what to avoid. If you don't know what gives you orgasms, how could a partner know what works?<br>  <br>  4) Reward your partner. Let them know of your situation, discuss options non-confrontationally and involve them in your pursuit. Mix up the shared experiences to find what works best: avoid humdrum. Compliment even marginal progress: non-praise for non-progress will be noted but not accusatory.<br>  <br>  5) Develop an open attitude. Allow yourself enjoyment; don't deny yourself for any oppresive belief structure. Masturbation isn't sinful: unborns do it in the womb. Non-procreative sex -- within or without marriage or "permanent" bonding -- CAN be not just pleasurable but truly transporting. Accept ALL predilictions and expressions of sexuality, without feeling obliged to experience or embrace them.<br>  <br>  In this forum, answers can only be brief.

You can try varying positions to find one that puts more pressure on your clitoris and G-spot. Also get bf to give you longer foreplay and oral or shame him by getting a vibrator!<br>  <br>  You should be able to orgasm by masturbating, use either fingers or vibrator/toys. <br>  <br>  If not there may be some psychological reason why you hold back and just can't relax enough to ***. Need to loosen up and not worry about it. It's just sex.|`|c234708de9d5b6e1c8b08c8e21176048aa	There are a LOT of variables here that you don't state.<br>  I'm an older guy, and I've been a LOT of girl's first orgasm, so I think I have a unique perspective on this, that probably most of the other people answering don't have.<br>  <br>  A few general facts about female orgasms:<br>  1. Many women don't get their first orgasm until they are in their late 20's to early 40's.<br>  2. The single biggest cause of being non-orgasmic is your mind - sexual guilt. It's almost never a physical problem with your body.<br>  3. Most women orgasm from clitoral stimulation, FAR more than through vaginal stimulation.<br>  4. Most women orgasms FIRST from masturbation, before they can get off from someone else giving them an orgasm.<br>  <br>  OK, there are the 'clinical' facts.<br>  Now here is what I've helped a lot of girls & women get past to have their first orgasms:<br>  <br>  1. You MUST be able to feel comfortable with the pleasure you're feeling. You have to get past the guilt feelings about sex, religious guilt about sex, etc.  <br>  You have to get over feeling distracted by ANYTHING while you're being pleasured (or pleasuring yourself), like worrying about what you look like, if you deserve to feel this much pleasure, etc.<br>  A LOT of girls/women get close to orgasm, then they feel like they 'just can't keep going' or whatever.  This is what you have to push past!!!  You MUST keep going!<br>  <br>  You need to learn how to masturbate.<br>  Start on your clit. You are not very likely to orgasm from putting anything in your vagina, until you've first learned how to have a clitoral orgasm.<br>  If you have a mate, then you need to concentrate on getting this person to become a master at oral sex! <br>  An experienced person at oral sex is going to be the quickest road to a good orgasm!<br>  (I'm assuming you're an adult here with this next advice).<br>  If all else fails, put an ad on something like www.swinglifestyle.com asking for an older man to do nothing but go down on you.<br>  I'm serious. There are lots of older guys like me who would love to do this for you! Just be sure to follow all the usual safe practices, like meeting the guy in public first, tell people where you're going, even run a background check on the person if you want to.<br>  An orgasm is a wonderful thing, and there's no reason you should not have one, so you should go to almost any extreme to have one!!!<br>  Once you have one, it's kinda like riding a bicycle - you will have an easier time for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Feel free to PM me if you want more advice.|`|BZ1LQGDGaa	well, i think you need some communitcation with your partner to figure out stuff that can turn you on and give u an orgasm.
YupMCYHlaa	Absentmindedness is usually just a minor annoyance.  But in extreme cases it can be a health problem.  Some people have serious problems with short-term memory, which can be caused by different kinds of brain diseases and dementia, or even just hypoglycemia.  But for most of us it's just a minor thing.<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with diabetes about five years ago.  It was really shocked and frightened and I changed my diet abruptly to include very very little carbohydrates.  In the next few weeks I had serious problems with absentmindedness and short-term memory loss.  I would leave the house, get 100 yards away in the car and wonder if I had locked the door.  I didn't remember locking the door!  I'd come back, and the door would be locked, and I'd leave again and 100 yards away I'd wonder AGAIN if I had locked the door!  It really drove me nuts!<br>  <br>  I had other problems like not being able to keep track of conversations, suddenly wondering what we were talking about.  That was really scary.  I thought I must be developing some kind of dementia.<br>  <br>  Finally I learned that my body had reacted to my sudden change in diet.  It was acting like I had low blood sugar, even though I didn't, just because it had lowered so quickly.  I began sneaking a few grams of carbohydrate back into my diet, and the symptoms went away.<br>  <br>  That was a serious health problem!  But a temporary one, thank goodness.|`|HHuS48u5aa	not on its own..<br>  <br>  could indicate dehydration...
gvukdlOjaa	From what I understand, yes, carrots do make you somewhat orange is that's all you eat.<br>  <br>  Eating little slows down your metabolism.  You should eat several small meals a day.  Most I know who do this eat small quanities five times a day.  I'd recommend the meals to be 40% lean protein, 30% HEALTHY carbs, and 30% healthy fats.  <br>  <br>  If you don't know what healthy carbs are, they're complex carbs such as those in whole wheat items or things like brown rice.  Healthy fats are those low is saturated fats such as olive oil.<br>  <br>  And here's a thought if you're trying to loose weight...EXERCISE!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, but that's too hard...no one wants to do that...|`|R8fVBPnmaa	That's not a smart thing to do at all !!.1.) starving your body even for a short time I think could be sendind mixed signals to your body functions & or brain !?! Which could have damaging effects on ones self !! "EAT TO SURRVIVE/stay healthy & or alive"!!. "EXCERCISE to work off or burn off calories from fat!! & to tell or help your body to burn off the bad things you do'nt want to stick/keep & or build as un`wanted body fat or weight !?!.   rRr|`|mdudtx7zaa	In my opinion, this is not good for you. I'd suggest eating several small meals through out the day. If you eat too little your body will start acting like it's starving and will slow your metabolism down even more. Also, you want to have a balanced diet for your health. While carrots are good for you, you need to have a balance of foods. If you still only want to eat one meal a day (calorie wise), I'd suggest breaking that up to at least 3 meals a day (i.e., split up the meal into 3 portions through out the day) and you'll have more success losing weight.<br>  <br>  With regard to turning orange, you'd have to eat a lot of carrots for that even to have any affect. Probably won't happen in your case|`|wkN4wjYfaa	Eating only one mean a day is not good for you. And you probably won't loose that much weight. Because you're not feeding your body enough and it will hold all the fat on it. You would loose more weight and it would be better for you if you eat 3 meals a day. HEALTHY meals, or course. And maybe a veggie or fruit as a snack. And also you must excersise, thats the most important part.|`|hqaSMGD7aa	Yes, it is bad. You are still depriving your body of nutrients, and your body will go into starvation mode and conserve as much fat as it can so you won't lose any weight at all.<br>  <br>  My advice is to eat smarter. Whole grains, fruits and veggies, lean meats. Counting calories will help too, but if you're a teenager do not go under 1500. You're only hurting yourself that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|186fe2ae6cf96d737b74484879d9d50daa	you'll burn more calories if you eat smaller meals throughout the day, whcih will keep your energy up....and possibly your brain functioning?!!!|`|5yRtpe9baa	yes it is a really bad idea. your body needs nutrients and even fats, oils and sugars to work properly. you should eat three meals a day but healthier meals, or even work out some. im sure you can find some figures online.

JdkPNBuYaa	the only way you're really fat is if you can see flab hanging from your stomach or if your thighs have fat.  I'm 5'5" and i weigh 130 ish, but i'm not fat because i'm fit.  Fatness also depends on your bone density as well as how much muscle you have.  Muscle weighs more than fat.  Since i am fit and well-toned i have muscle.  I run track as well so i have a lot of muscle in my legs, therefore i would wiegh more than a supermodel.  However, i am not fat because i have no flab whatsoever
6kA3TwZvaa	NO BE A MAN AND SUCK IT UP. IT IS JUST A CUT. SCARES HEAL|`|AA11318156	Also I'm not a doctor, but you seem to have taken the basic precautions for a puncture wound. Continue monitoring the site for additional redness, swelling, and/or oozing. If any of this occurs/persists, contact your doctor.|`|aAZaqTpEaa	Well from what you described its just a small cut. Depending on how small you mean but you should be fine. Like you said your dog has been vaccinated, and its your dog, not a stray. If it starts to get infected, then yes go to the clinic, but if not, you should be fine. My dogs have bitten me and I have never had to go to the doctor.|`|e88874ba1e4887779acb81efdc9e8183aa	I am not a doctor.

You likely do not need to visit an emergency room.|`|XObPozpmaa	i've had worse.<br>  but if the dog is vaccinated, then you should be fine (but if starts to hurt then yeah, call a doctor)|`|29hxVukYaa	keep it clean and watch it for a few days.

AA11318156	Each person has a specific level of tolerance based on their age, height/weight, level of the drug, and many other circumstances. Many medications do have a certain limitation for usage before a tolerance is built up and the drug is no longer as effective as it once was.|`|GI0WvmFDaa	Thats really too broad of a question to give a specific answer... but yeah the human body can build up a tolerance to certain drugs very quickly|`|A9AurTy3aa	It depends on the person its called tolerance level. What your body can tolerate depends on how often you take the drug and your body type.

046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	The only sure way to know if you have breast cancer is to have a biopsy done.  That is when a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from your breast for analysis.  This is way ahead of other steps you can take to determine if you need to see a doctor.<br>  Google The American Cancer Society.  They will have instructions on how to do a self-breast exam.  Mensturating females need to do one monthly.  Doing it around the time of your period will help you remember.  <br>  Remember that breasts are generally lumpy anyway and once you've done enough exams you'll be familiar with your own lumps and you'll be able to tell the difference if a growth occurs.<br>  <br>  You are still in puberty.  Some breast discomfort comes with normal development.  Those "pimple like" bumps are normal.  They'll help deliver milk to a baby when you become a breast feeding mother.  They are tube like structures.  Some women's are more pronounced than others.  <br>  <br>  Relax.  Go to the site.  I doubt you have a growth. See your doctor if you are still in doubt after learning from the website.  It will ease your mind.

Muscle is waaaayyyy sexier than fat, even on girls...because its skinny and it shapes your body<br>  And don't worry, unless you are taking steroids, its really hard for girls to become bulky like guys do, so by all means, get muscular, it rocks...|`|MyKyEJUvaa	try using weight gainer it has more calories
3OL3gZX4aa	What would work to lose weight without going to the gym is, playing sports, get involved, it helps you burn weight and tone your muscles. You can try martial arts, it's also calorie burning. Also, you can do some yardwork, For added workout, get a regular lawnmower. One that isn't a vehicle, and doesn't push for you. It may be a pain in the rear end, but you'll notice your rear end will be getting smaller and smaller.  Also, if you go to your local grocery store, you might notice they have president's choice, and they have blue menu products, they are low in fat, and contain lots of fibre, this will help you while excersing around the house.
xKyBUnesaa	Hi,<br>  I've heard about a condition with symptoms your describing but I can't remember the name.

I would see a doctor just to be on the safe side so everything is clear.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	Typically, 3-4 hours is the maximum duration of a cannabis high. Duration has more to do with THC content and genetic strain, with some cannabis producing longer and/or more intense highs than others. The amount you consume also plays a role. "3 huge puffs" of mediocre weed may produce less of a high that two moderate hits of really good weed. Eating, especially sweets, will help bring you down.|`|Yh4CXJgdaa	9 or 10<br>  lol<br>  too high huh<br>  not me :0|`|6f9a391059cc9f9810218a27760396e9aa	If you don't feel good, you could start feeling better in around 20 minutes, you won't be sober but you will probably start feeling better in around that much time.
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	My dad practices cranial sacral on small children and babies. I don't quite understand it myself, but he has a good number of regular clients that swear by it and keep coming back to him. He used to do it to me when I was little and it never bothered me.<br>  <br>  I know for certain that he truly believes in it and doesn't tell people a bunch of hoodoo crap just go get money. He's been studying it for years and is apparently quite good at it.

It would be hella easy to just wake up and drink a half gallon of water and 2000 calories of food and be set for the day but our bodies don't work like that.|`|LKyGCaFQaa	90g of protein in one meal is alot of protein just in that its alot of food or powder.  3 meals of 30g would be alot easier for your body to digest.  On absorption rates Whey protein  is digested slower and feeds your muscles at a slower rate for a longer time.  Casine protein is digested faster and provides nutrients at a faster rate for a shorter time.

And you were perhaps too lubed.  If there's too much wet or lube, just use a towel and dry it off a bit.  You might also try tightening your vaginal muscles during sex for a little extra resistance. <br>  On a different note, if you did have an allergic reaction to the condoms, you'd have some drying and swelling which would tighten things right up...  in a sort of undesireable way.|`|AA10285288	Tiny penis is my theory.|`|CGFAPKJOaa	He may have been too small.|`|ZMyABA8caa	what you can do is, even if he is too small doesnt matter.

Do a playback in your mind of what changed the day you started having the reaction.

9YXn58Vnaa	I didn't get ur reason for exercise...........however, if u r working out to get slim then u must sweat bcoz more u sweat more u loose calories. Remember there should be always a time gap of 1/2 an hour between exercise and your shower or else u r work out will be vain and u may fall ill. <br>  But if the reason is to remain fit and active then sweating is not necessary at all and morning walk is the best (as u r doing now). This will result in active mind and body and start intake fruit juice after every exercise. This will really work. Trust me...... :)<br>  Also u can do some exercises in the office also like stretching body, neck exercise (however don't know your job profile).|`|OQSdjIcoaa	not really, sweating is usually a good sign your burning calories well. The body produces sweat when you are hot. The reason for this is so that when the sweat evaporates off of your body it also grabs some of your body heat thus cooling you down. So if your not getting too hot from a routine.. chances are its not doing much. Theres a reason gym teachers say you should be sweating by the end of the workout.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D <br>  <br>  anyone answer mine? <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304171220AAdk0e3">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	I'm not sure.

So sweating is necessary for your body temp. to stay down!|`|GvBtoKsqaa	The effectiveness of your workout is not determined by how much you sweat.<br>  <br>  Your body only sweats when it's hot and if you're exercising in a cool place or something then you won't feel much sweat but you'll still be burning calories.<br>  <br>  If you're not sweating that could be a good thing, that means you're already in decent shape.|`|31718204759da1a7cdd40b824d43650aaa	Yes... Overheating can cause brain damage.<br>  The reason we have hair is to speed up evaporation.<br>  <br>  Evaporation is the principle at work in air conditioners.<br>  The primary component is a restriction tube and a device known as an evaporator and condenser. <br>  <br>  Hair increases the surface area from which the liquid can contact the drier air.  In a process known as wicking, or also known as capillary action. <br>  <br>  The body has a temperature range.  Higher or lower can cause death.<br>  <br>  Your correct answer.

JdkPNBuYaa	keep your self hydrated by drinking water!! DO NOT DRINK ORANGE JUICE! seriously orange juice will dehydrate you since it has other stuff in it unlike water.  However you can eat oranges.  Also get lots of sleep.  This allows your body to rest and rebuild its defense and fight more.  In addition you should cough up ALL of you phloem  you can do this by dipping a cotton ball in olive oil and touch the back of your throat, but dont make yourself throw up.

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Honestly you will be wasting your money.  A vasectomy reversal has less than a 25% chance of resulting in a natural pregnancy.  I do not care what the doctor who is selling false hope tells you.  They call any live sperm a "success".  That is why they can legally advertise 80% "success".<br>  <br>  Usually IVF is required after a reversal.  That cost about $27,000 a try.<br>  <br>  I am serious, and not just picking on you.<br>  <br>  Lots of luck.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	With all due respect to a prior response, I can tell you that the success rates vary widely but with the right surgeon, you can get 90-95% predictable success, not 25%.  <br>  <br>  I had a vasectomy in March, 2005 but due to complications known collectively as Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome (PVPS), I had a medically-necessary reversal in June, 2006.  While I didn't want more children, I wanted to ensure that my surgery was performed by an expert that could ensure (to the greatest degree possible) recontinuation of the normal flow of sperm in my reproductive tract so as to avoid the backpressure my epi's and testicles were experiencing while in a vasectomized state.<br>  <br>  So, I had my reversal at the world-reknown Cleveland Clinic by a microsurgical expert and pioneer in the field of microsurgical reconstruction of the reproductive tract.  I can tell you from personal experience that their results are far better than 25%.  In December, 2006, without trying, my wife and conceived our 4th daughter.  <br>  <br>  There are probably 10-20 true experts such as mine in the USA, but the cost will be $10,000 - $15,000 (not $25,000 as someone else suggested).  Dr. Marks in Tucson, AZ is a genius in this field, was trained at the Mayo Clinic, has performed over 3,000 reversals, offers a free phone consult, and charges around $10k.  He's a true gentleman.  Dr. Witt in Atlanta, Dr. Werthman in LA, and Dr. Lipshultz in Houston are other experts worth contacting.<br>  <br>  $1,700 sounds like a bargain basement price for a reason.  Plenty of urologists "do" reversals but achieve low success rates.  <br>  <br>  A highly skilled microsurgeon will greatly increase your chances of conceiving.|`|DCixOqsnaa	I would check with your local hospital or your family doctor. They know the urologists who might perform reversals in your area. Please keep in mind that this is a specialty surgery that is probably not covered by insurance. $1,700 seems very cheap for a reversal and I would be very careful. Make sure the doctor uses the microsurgery method and uses the double stitching method where he ties the inside of the vas tube as well as the outside.  You may need to travel to find a solid uro. Also ask how many reversals he has performed. DO NOT GO FLY BY NIGHT ON THIS!!! Good luck.

AUOp1j5Saa	The tests start to be reliable around a day or two before your missed period but are most reliable about a week or two afterwards provided you take them using morning urine.<br>  If you took the test and had a positive mark, which it sounds like you did although it's hard to tell with your grammar, then yes, you are almost definitely pregnant.<br>  It's much easier to get a false negative than a false positive on these tests because they look for a specific hormone that simply isn't in your system if you are not pregnant.<br>  I'm sorry, but the tests actually are quite accurate.

Practically a million things run through my brain in class alone, and it's really hard for me to pay attention.  Stress can be very physically and emotionally draining, and what i've found is that the easiest way to get rid of it is to talk to people about what's on your mind and what's bothering you.  I remember at 14 I had the hugest crush on a boy and I would think about that a lot.  My parents divorced and I had to deal with that. It really doesn't matter what age you are.

Teenagers need more sleep than adults ~ 10-11 hours a night. Be sure to go to bed early enough to get this much sleep. If you habitually stay up late at night your napping could be making this problem worse. You're tired so you nap, then at night you are awake, so you stay up late, then you are tired in the morning so you nap in the afternoon. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips that I have found helpful:<br>  1. Avoid naps.<br>  2. Turn off the tv, computer, video games, at least one hour before you want to go to bed. There is a light emitted from these devices that keeps your brain awake. <br>  3. Get up at the same time everyday. (Yes, even the weekends). When you sleep in on the weekends, you end up staying up later, making it difficult to get up in the next morning and resulting in sleep deprivation. <br>  4. Plan to get about 10 hours of sleep at night.<br>  5. Create a bedtime ritual. Read, meditate, or listen to music to help you wind down at the end of the day.<br>  6. Eat a well balanced diet. If you are eating a lot of carbs, sugar, empty calories, this is going to make you tired. You need to get a diet with fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and complex carbohydrates.<br>  7. Avoid energy drinks. They are loaded with sugar & caffeine which will make you crash.<br>  8. Avoid fancy coffee drinks -- same issue as above, plus they are loaded with fat and calories.

JFo1tiaQaa	Hi Nate, i have some ideas for you to help you get relief from a stiff neck and prevent a stiff neck in the first place. <br>  1. Do some simple neck stretches- this involves bringing your head towards your chest, extending your head up and laterally bending from side to side. Make sure you hold the stretch for at least 10-15 seconds. A moist heat pack can help facilitate your neck stretches before, or better yet, do them while in the shower. Here is a some easy neck stretches with pictures: <a href="http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page/993935" rel="nofollow">http://www.arc4life.com/site/615058/page...</a><br>  2. Get a good neck pillow to sleep on at night- this can make a huge difference because a cervical support neck pillow will ensure that your head and neck are aligned properly while sleeping. Don't sleep with too many neck pillows because that can bring your head way forward, creating spasms in the muscles. Check out Arc4life's Cervical traction neck pillow on their site www.arc4life.com<br>  3. Have someone do some muscle massage on your neck- work out the muscles using a topical analgesic pain gel<br>  4. Use a tens unit for muscle spasm relief at home<br>  5. Look at your workstation during the day and make sure you are seated ergonomically and not putting more stress on your neck and upper back while sitting. Here is a link for proper neck posture: <a href="http://www.neckpainreliefkit.com/neckposture" rel="nofollow">http://www.neckpainreliefkit.com/neckpos...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|TqEg1d97aa	i sometimes get a stiff and sore neck when i sleep sometimes. i usually take a hot bath with epsom salts, which in the past has really helped me. Try taking aleve, and also heating pads. I hope you feel better soon!|`|I9lwHvUgaa	I'm in the same situation u are in right now. Just wait it out. Take pain medication to ease the pain. I also tried something called "cupping" and i got a neck massage. I was painful but it did help alittle.|`|gW9dUa8Kaa	I had the same problem yesterday!

d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	you are not eating enough real food|`|o6ruEMVUaa	Is the organic low fat burrito something you make from scratch or is made homemade?<br>  <br>  is this a plan for one-three days a week? cause I agree with the person who said not enough real food :)<br>  <br>  Snacks should vary with variety of fruits and veggies. Try to get 4 to 6 servings of fruits and veggies daily. <br>  <br>  Remember some fat is good. Research good fat and incorporate it into diet. Gotta mix up your whole grains and switch up the dairy a little. Don't forget about protein (other than your protien bar and eggs). Variety is good for your body. :)
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	If done lightly and occasionally, such as one drink and one pill, it can be very effective in helping you relax and fall asleep. (I'll admit, I do that sometimes and it feels pretty good).<br>  <br>  If done in excess, it can kill you... you can go to sleep and never wake up... it stops your heart. That's how Marilyn Monroe died.|`|f2ebcc6f8692252ee4077de8f0b301a9aa	It can be fatal..mixing drugs, medicine & alcohol can very easily kill you..it's not worth taking a chance on to "feel good"|`|1558af5afc8a17386c4771aeef147603aa	Bad.

I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat<br>  <br>  Take a multi vitamin at night
etV271ARaa	Swim. There isnt anything better to trim your shoulders and upper back. I recommend the breaststroke. Take some protein drink which will give you the stamina you need and try slow strokes. The idea is to get a long slow workout which expands energy slowly and works all the muscles. STart with 5 laps, then increase progressively until you can do 40 non stop. But do it slowly and dont over strain so you cant do it everyday.
IX4mSxEMaa	I agree with your stand point... to a certain extent.  Sure in all likelihood, suicide is never the answer.  However to that highly impossible circumstance that's potrait in the movie warrant that sometime there really can be a need for it even if it seems wrong.  And for those who mentioned medically assisted suicides... on moral grounds I do not agree with it, however, for a patient who has suffered terminal illness and at current time with no hope to survive... if patient him or herself has expressed a wish to end it, such suicide still merits a real consideration not only on the medical staff but also patient, and their relatives.<br>  <br>  So to reiterate my stand point.  Generally speaking I do agree suicide is not the answer.  However I also believe every circumstance has an exception.  Therefor, I also feel there just may have some cases and circumstances where suicide is the best course of action to take even if personally I do not want it to be true.|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	Is it always the wrong answer?  What about someone who has a terminal disease that will only result in endless months of suffering?  What about someone who has heard voices and had delusions for years with no help from medication?  Can you imagine how much they must suffer?  Personally, I don't think suicide is always the wrong answer.|`|uvOhOUllaa	i believe that sometimes suicide is an acceptable answer. some people really do have problems that are too much, and some people can grow to hate themselves. hating yourself is no way to live, and so they decide they want to die.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	If you seriously don't enjoy life, if every second of your life is pain and suffering, isn't suicide the right answer?<br>  <br>  How can you say when someone may take their own life? Who gave you that authority?|`|aBWV0Pyraa	Lol!<br>  <br>  Who said it's the wrong answer in All Ways?|`|1K8NPRUOaa	maybe knows that life is really an important thing these days.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Why is it wrong?|`|BO3MiHRRaa	JUST BECAUSE IT ALWAYS IS!!|`|D0wM1Qpeaa	Suicide is the best drink what are you talking about????|`|NnhP2phpaa	well<br>  yeah<br>  suicide pretty much is the wrong answer|`|LOfZNNdfaa	Always the wrong answer?  What if your body had been injected by an evil scientists serum that contained the most deadly virus in the world that would eventually make you become a beast who could spread the virus just by touching people.  This would eventually lead to the formation of an army of ruthless mutant humans that would take over the world.  The virus is a parasite and needs you to be alive for it to survive.  There is no antidote and the fate of mankind is in your hands.  Do you kill yourself or be the onset of the end of mankind as we know it.  I ask you, in this case, is suicide the answer?|`|cidwIuJRaa	Because suicide may end all the questions,but is never really an answer.<br>  <br>  We've all been through some bad times in our lives,but that is never a reason to end our lives.There is alwayz someone out there that cares about us,and it would make them feel bad.<br>  <br>  This coming from someone who used to have a really good relationship with scissors may not mean much,but everyone can overcome whatever problem is making them feel like they want to do this,if they try.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	I totally believe that it doesn't solve anything and only causes more problems to those left behind. There's so many other options out there like getting help.|`|y78V0AlXaa	To me really, to be honest, it's the right way. I have one thing that I really wish I could tell of but I can't cuz I don't trust everyone out there and I'm not comfortable talking about one of my issues, but I know that I am a cutter and suicidal. I am doing everything in my power no to cut cuz I made a promise to someone, even though that someone hates me now. I so badly want to just end everything right now cuz of all the crap that is going on. If you read my recent question it states like a couple things. But my entire history in my life has been terrible and I'm sick of it all. So to me, it's not the wrong answer cuz there is no for me to live for. Which is the only reason I would want to live, is to be there for the person I love. Unfortunately, anyone that I love runs away...|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Because after that you are nothing more then a wandering spirit ;D<br>  <br>  or whatever other people believe when you die.|`|StJGeiFyaa	haha that's right-on. it really is the only thing that is always wrong.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Never take a permanent soultion to a temporary problem
KHhRgzXtaa	is ur daughter short?,, cos 48kg is pretty good<br>  my daughter is 12 and weighs 40, shes average height<br>  dont worry too much, shes still growin<br>  stop buying snacky foods like choc and chips, thatll stop her snackin on crap, good luck|`|OMYd6p3gaa	that is fine for a 13 year old, considering she is average height. If you are concerned, cook healthy meals for your family, and invite her in the process of preparing these meals. This is when kids learn about nutrition. If you want her to exercise, do something you know she likes without it being obvious that it is excercise. Take a swimming class with her, go  bike riding or rollerblading with her. Do family activities like going to the park, to the beach etc. She wont realise that it is exercise at all and will have a fun time enjoying her family. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|htBHCNDtaa	If we don't know the height it's useless knowing her weight.<br>  <br>  If she's 48,7kgs and 130cms tall then she's ok, a little round but normal, if she 170cms and 48.7kgs, she's almost anorexic.|`|3NdBYdlOaa	DONT SAY ANYTHING TO HER FOR GODS SAKE,she will be crushed,I would hate if my mom called me fat,just buy healthy food,so she'll have no reason to eat fatty foods,but dont crush her spirit,be sneaky|`|ww3ukbdVaa	eating healthy and exercise. your her mother and you should lead her instead of her not liking exercise. she is overweight therefore she does not like exersice. force her to do it|`|ZMyABA8caa	you should google for a BMI calculator which will tell you if shes obese or not.|`|qje4beuBaa	Google BMI (Body Mass Index)|`|AqRLweMwaa	idk but i think that you sould make her play more sports that she likes|`|eYmIlVnGaa	if you cook for her at dinner just cook healthier meals. Dont get her worrying about her body and neither of you should ever worry about weight but instead about being healthy! talk to her about being healthy and the two of you together should start making healthier choices. You could try going for a walk or run every day and invite her every time. try to thing of a bonding game you can do on the walk or use it as a mom and daughter talk time. the best thing you could do for her is show her how to be HEALTHY by example and neither of you should ever focus on weight!|`|e96934aa96b1acb2fc75182f85852f5aaa	Well, around 13 years old is the "okward time" anyways, if she is comfortable with her body thats the best thing, and she will start to grow into it. Dont put an emphasis on it, let here choose for herself to become heathy, but take the extra sweet and carb stuff out of your cuboards so its not an opiton, make sure the fruit bowl is plentiful as well as the veggie tray, and dont give her opportunitees to eat unheathy (such as going out for fast food) mabey make a family challenge, whoever can exersise the most minutes a week gets a prize or something.  Whatever you do, as long as she likes her body thats all that truly matters, <br>  Good luck!|`|2vBmRcv6aa	If she is overweight or not you should have healthy food in the house and not buy junk food.  Be physically active yourself. There isn't much you can do to make a 13 year old do things, but you can set a good example.<br>  You could use one of those bmi calculators to find out if she is overweight but that still depends on muscle mass.|`|rFlhIgJXaa	about 100 pounds... whats her height? i would just feed her healthier foods such as more vegetables, less starch (BUT STILL HAVE STARCH IN THE DIET)... if you can hide vegetables in good food (thats what one must do to make me eat them :D ) its a good idea (example... stew, soup, shepherd's pie)<br>  <br>  ... From the picture she looks to be fine, why are you worried about her weight... as long as she is happy why aren't you happy for her? I never exercise and i am 5'10 140lbs, i eat like no tomorrow.|`|cUtn9Wb3aa	buy a wii fit :) or suggest something fun like dancing or playing ddr if she doesn't like exercise.|`|cf6fd7a114fa1687119395d4a7148ffbaa	for all the other answerers, 48.7 kg~107 lbs.<br>   <br>  idk if she's overweight knowing the height would help|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	cook healthy things for her. She is 13 so everything she eats is being prepared or baught from you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|UjFgWnfBaa	she could be weighing more because of muscle mass especially if she does sports.. Ask her doctor when in doubt|`|bXmRWbEdaa	How tall is she?  At five feet tall, a good weight is 95 lbs.   Add 5 lbs for every inch and subtract 5 lbs for every inch under five feet tall.<br>  <br>  Don't give her a complex about her size.  Stop nagging her.  You may end up making her neurotic.|`|azY3Qmjdaa	hamsters can have human children!|`|V9uMoELzaa	I believe she is 107 pounds. She is probley a little over weight, I can't tell because her height isn't listed.<br>  <br>  The best thing is healthy eating!

Also, try to stay away from red meat cuz of high cholestrol.<br>  <br>  Remember--dont make her feel bad--be nice! Also, go on walks after lunch or sumthin for sum excersice. You could also sign her up for swimming, sports, or dance for sum fun excersize|`|GTwVNeHraa	um, can you translate that into pounds?<br>  <br>  and i don't know what the weight is, but if she's not over 125 pounds, she's good, she's growing and all that.|`|h31I5hSAaa	yea i have no idea about kg!<br>  <br>  **edit: i looked up kg --> lbs and no she is not overweight dont worry.|`|2ujGxeiEaa	107 pounds?! that sounds healthy. stop worrying.
xRQAsGRAaa	Buy a light dumbell, or resistance bands from walmart(or anywhere). Make sure it's pretty light, but also heavy enough that your arm will get pretty tired from lifting it 12-15 times.<br>  Curl it 12-15 times in a row. This is one set. Do 4-5 sets, taking a 30 second break between each set.<br>  Next, do tricep extensions.

Try to find a chiroprator whom also is a fan of alternative medicine.<br>  <br>  Yoga and tai chi and other forms of stretching are very good ways to help and maintain your backs health.|`|GXiCrhVYaa	I recommend that you see a physical therapist. It is not an easier way to heal your back, but it is a much more effective way to a healthy back, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  A physical therapist session usually starts with an ice pack, heat pack or ultrasound therapy, depending on your back problem. Sometimes a little massage is used. Then the PT will show then you non-strenuous  physical exercises specifically designed to help your back problem. In my opinion, when a chiropractor adjusts your spine, the problem is likely to come back in a day or two. It is better to work on PT exercises that strengthen the muscles of the back. <br>  <br>  In terms of pain relief, you can ask a pharmacist for suggestions. They will probably recommend Advil, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, etc. If this does not stop the pain, you might need to see an MD, who can prescribe more powerful pain medications. Some of them can be addictive, so please be careful.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Lift weights in a gym.

It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment, as it will often do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.<br>  <br>  I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care.

UZJ7wVc8aa	You need to eat WAY more than 1500 calories to gain weight. Yes you'll gain a bit of fat but there's no other way. 1500 calories isn't anywhere near enough to support muscle growth.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a>|`|3sPVbL2Naa	to gain muscle mass takes time and hard work, <br>  <br>  to get the muscle you want do low reps with heavy weights <br>  heavy enough that you have to push yourself but not to heavy that you struggle, and do low reps id say between 8-10 per set ( remember 2-3 sets is a good number) you only gain 2-3 pounds of dry muscle in a long period of time but it will definetly show and your strenght will also increace and you need to eat alot of lean protein and caolires to rebuild teh muscle
Mizlm9ndaa	Well, I've had symptoms very similar to what you describe, and if I were you I wouldn't be so quick to attribute them to "NO reason" other than brain chemistry.  Besides, our behaviors are not always a product of our brain chemistry.  Our behaviors can often be the cause of said chemistry.  The unconscious or subconscious mind is, by definition, at work more than we realize.  Rather than prescribe you some meds, I'd advise you to do some introspection.  That's what got me through it.  :D|`|jGacenaiaa	Do you drink alcohol or caffeine?|`|nOrWOZU4aa	I've had that almost asleep thing, then a panic, then wake up, and for no reason.  I don't know what that is, but I think everyone gets that at least once.  Your morning thing at noon and at first thing is probably related to sleeping badly the night before.  If you are drinking coffee or coke, stop, caffeine has ways to wreck sleep patterns and put people on red alert for no reason.  Try a night light, then it won't be so dark when you wake up in the middle of the night.|`|RoBCd6tSaa	i think you get advice to professional psychologist.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Here are a couple of screening tests.<br>  <a href="http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/anxiety.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/anxiety....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.freedomfromfear.org/screenrm.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedomfromfear.org/screenrm....</a><br>  <a href="http://remap.net/GAD_7.html" rel="nofollow">http://remap.net/GAD_7.html</a><br>  <br>  When I was in my 20's (I'm 59 now), I had many, many panic attacks.

tNsH0yQxaa	I rarely get pimples, but when I do they are as you have described. Very sore, big and swells, especially if you try to squeeze it. In a few days it will probably come to a head and you'll be able to see a white/yellow tip on it. There isn't much you can really do... Maybe get an anti-spot pen or something for next time, it'll dry it out and the swelling will go down. They're sold in chemists and pretty much anywhere that sells a good range of skin products. To stop it from getting worse make sure you keep your skin clean.|`|dxDSrpCbaa	might be infected hair on your face. put hot hot hot compresses on it for about 15 min. i mean as hot as you can stand it.|`|kW6vXLW3aa	yikes,i hate those!most likely a pimple/zit.<br>  just stop touching it or it'll get worse.

It's not like a magic pill that changes you... hopefully it will just make you feel better inside and not want to cut.

This is a personal decision that you need to discuss with your doctor. Be sure to find out about the side affects. There are some antidepressants that are not recommended for use by adolescents. Be sure to get all the information before you make a decision. If you decide to take meds, be sure to consult with your doctor before stopping use. There can be negative consequences of abruptly stopping.<br>  <br>  If you decide not to take medication, there are natural treatments for depression. The best treatment (even better than meds) is regular, vigorous exercise. Discuss this option with your doctor.|`|Ci681r6Laa	If your Doctor has prescribed medication for your depression you may want to give it a chance. When I went through my episode of depression and anxiety (by the way some say those two are cousins) I did not want to take the medication but I decided that if I want to get better it was well worth it to give it a try. I do not regret it.<br>  <br>  Some meds do have certain side effects but that depends on how your body assimilates it. If the side effects do not go away after a reasonable time, then your doctor can change the med until you find the one that suits you.<br>  <br>  Depression is a result of negative affirmations, traffic of negative thoughts going on for quite some time in your mind that you believe of yourself.<br>  <br>  So, take the plunge with faith and love yourself more and more.

It's fashionable among kids to condemn psyciatric drugs because they read these inane books and see retarded movies where people refuse to take their medication for schizophrenia and end up murdering a whole family. Antidepressants correct the chemical imbalance in your brain that contributes to feelings of depression. They don't affect your personality or any of that other stuff in the slightest. My advice is try the medicine. It's trial an error, and sometimes takes a few months and and a few medications to find the "right" one. If you don't like it you can always stop. No doctor will force you to take these if they have an adverse reaction.

W1xs3vYBaa	Everyone is born with an IQ range, and your range may be 120 to 131 or so. <br>  <br>  Right now your hormones are once again changing, as is your situation. This can all affect how you think. People often have good years and bad years based upon their health. If you feel like you are constantly mentally cloudy then I would go see a professional. It could be a symptom for something. <br>  <br>  IQ tests are not really reliable, so don't put too much in their numbers. Also, only put any weight into professionally taken ones.<br>  <br>  Still, if you are feeling slower and it is affecting your life I would see someone. As well, eat right. Take Omega 3's, it has been proven(oxford) that it can increase your neuro-transmitters which will make you feel more aware and comprehend ideas quicker. <br>  That and exercise and stretching are the best bets for quick and consistent health. <br>  <br>  However, we are just yahoo answers and cannot really judge the real cause.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Make sure you get enough sleep.  Do you have depression? that can really affect learning and memory.  Are you using medication (side effects?), or using illegal drugs(side effects, can cause brain damage in young people)?<br>  <br>  I have always credited the fact I didn't watch much TV as an adolescent/teen as a help to me - when other kids were watching TV, I was reading.  That gave me hours more time to keep my brain active.  I also did a lot of story writing with a friend of mine, and I'm sure that helped. Boggle and Scrabble and games like that probably helped.<br>  <br>  IQ does shift some with more education. Keep working on your weaker subjects, and that will help you. No meds or supplements will help IQ - only concentration.  IQ is genetic, plus a result of stimulating your brain (learning).  Are you multitasking all the time? Research shows that doing more than one thing at a time really wrecks your performance.<br>  <br>  I think you are being too hard on yourself - if your math was only OK and your english was terrible, you wouldn't score 120 on an IQ test. And where are people taking these IQ tests, anyhow? In all my life, I have never had an IQ test.  An IQ of 120 is about average for most professions requiring an advanced degree.<br>  <br>  PS sometimes people go thru a culture shock when they hit more advanced classes, at least in the US. I hardly ever did my homework in high school, but when I hit college, I had to study physics maybe 8 to 10 hours a week, and calculus at least 6, plus extra time before exams.  A lot of people just don't spend enough time studying. You have to do almost all the homework, not just a few problems, even if the professor doesn't make you turn this stuff in.  MOst people I know who do poorly at english, don't read for entertainment.|`|of049X1waa	your IQ cannot just change, so chances are it is something else.  Sounds like a concentration problem to me.  Consider things that might be distracting you.  Are you drinking now that you're in uni?  are you getting enough sleep and relaxation time? try taking a weekend off from seeing anyone, and just try to catch up on sleep.|`|8P1yz9t0aa	just do daily mental excises like counting backwards from 100 in 7s.|`|uIZDd3y5aa	I don't know, but this has recently happened to me too.|`|7f8d05e3674077143007bbb7d8600031aa	I feel the same way.  My grammar and spelling used to be sooo good, now I cannot believe i misspell some of the easiest things.  I took chemistry for 3 years and I just feel like now i don't get any of the simple concepts.  It's not necessarily your intelligence, it's just that certain things need refreshing.  Reading and studying up on them would help, but i think it would be a waste of time.  I for one can get math if i work on it, and it come natural then.  But I think you're just being too hard on yourself.  It's the basis of life you learn more things as you grow older and you need to rid yourself of some of the things that don't matter to make room for the new.  I for one don't think an intelligence test is going to tell you if you are really smart, there are other factors.

It is from the lack of food and then getting blood taken makes your body empty.  So when getting blood taken, don't forget to eat a meal.
GW2OLwn2aa	Well prevent is somewhat of a bad choice of word. There are couple possible reasons for myopia to occur. <br>  <br>  First one occur within the lens of your eyes. When you see far away objects, your lenses become as flat as possible to direct the incoming light source to the focal point behind your eye. In this case, your lens cannot become flat enough to redirect the light source directly at the focal point. <br>  <br>  Second one has to do with the shape of your eyeballs. During puberty your eyes might have grown in length/depth rather than a perfect circular shape. When this occur, your focal point behind your eye is not reaching the sensory neurons at the back of your eyes thus nearsighted. However some people have proven to be able to "fix" this. Your eyeballs are essentially two round muscles. One method is to practice staring at far away objects for a certain period of time throughout the day. This will work the top and bottom portion of your eyes and through this practice hopefully your eyes will become rounder again. There are books out there that talk about this, however the library at my university does not carry the book or it has been misplaced.<br>  <br>  As to your question, visual stress can cause myopia.
HnSUI518aa	No! tampons, Tylenol,pepto. Fix the problem don't block it. Stop lookin in your medicine cabinet for a band-aid  to cover up your symptoms. Go into your kitchen grab a couple of cloves of garlic and make a herbal infusion by crushing the garlic and let steep in HOT water for a few then drink. Garlic is antibacterial, anti fungal great for food poisoning.|`|NXodF671aa	They can stop the smell...... Here's what you do - Put the applicator in some oily solution - Check the kitchen, there might be some veggie oil or Pam cooking spray there. Once lubed, insert the applicator up your nose, and push the plunger. once inserted, do the other side. <br>  As a side note, this works really well for blocking any offensive odors.

TGMUFytraa	It's something that has happened because you were wearing earings. It doesn't go away on it's own and, like your doctor said, it can be removed. You shouldn't worry about it and there is NOTHING you can do about it. It's a bump that isn't doing any harm or will not do any harm. Just leave it or get it removed. There is nothing you can do or should do. It's like a bump like your nipple.

Give it a try!|`|ogeRU7KEaa	1 pound = 3500 calories.
EPaYoJaiaa	I don't think that's always the case. Sometimes things aren't as bad as they seem and though someone may be going through a tough time they can generally pull through it just fine. Sometimes lifes just hard and getting the blues is a part of being human. Just because you're down in the dumps and thinking about depression doesn't mean you're depressed.<br>  Being depressed is more about when things are going decent or well for you and you still can't seem to find reasons to get up in the morning or get yourself motivated to do even your favorite activities. It's more of a mindset than an emotion. <br>  Most people are in denial of it and often don't realize what's happening until friends and family get involved. There are some that can recognize it for what it is and either do something or choose not to do anything.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	The problem is that in english, we say "depression" for a sad mood, and then go and use the same word for clinical depression, which is much more than a sad mood, and goes on for much longer, usually.  Also, grief can get mixed up with depression - a person may be sad for a long time not only after the death of a loved one, but maybe they lost their home to foreclosure, got downsized out of a job, etc. It's when it goes on and on and on beyond any "reasonable" time (that's hard to define) that it would be depression.<br>  <br>  Many people do not realize they have depression. Not everyone cries. Some people get mystery illnesses, or aches and pains, or are very irritable.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of people here on yahoo answers who think they have depression, but do not, it is grief over a breakup, or something, or they are sad for a few hours.  There are lots of relatives here on yahoo answers, on the other hand, who wish their spouse or whomever would get help for depression, but they deny that they are depressed.<br>  <br>  I think for depression, a majority of people with depression do know they have it.|`|XNrFtyxOaa	everyone goes through "bouts" of depression which usually lasts for about a week or so then passes but if you or whoever this is has symptoms of depression such as: losing interest in things they usually enjoy or sleeping/eating too less or too much and having a continued low are some of the signs that you may have depression.  it is also said that depression can be heredity which means it can be passed from and to family members in some cases.|`|rJu4X6MDaa	I've been feeling like this for years, i thought everyone felt this way.

It may be good to go see a psychologist in case you really are depressed but in denial.|`|F86Ef0vhaa	Well, some people have it and either don't realize it, or deny it even when diagnosed, and some people have it and know it.

And if someone suggested to you that you are, you'd deny it.<br>  <br>  I don't know, that's just what I think.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Look up the symptoms, if you have enough of them chances are you are depressed. Remember, to be depressed it does have to be over an extended period of time, otherwise it's just a low mood.
La9fanNbaa	It is hard to say as it is different for everyone. Now mind you the likelihood of becoming pregnant within a week would be lower (most likely), as hcg levels are still elevated and the person will not be ovulating. That being the "likely" scenario anything could happen and people have been known to get prego in the 1st two weeks after the procedure. One thing to note though, you should be abstaining from sex within the 1st week as to avoid infection.<br>  So they are on birth control? If they are, chances are much lower and they should be ok if it was started immediately. <br>  Regarding Plan B, I assume it would be ok to take but I would read up on it or ask the pharmacist when you purchase.... if indeed that is what you decide to do.
PAvYZJK2aa	no it doesn't|`|CNW6eAjoaa	No, it will not affect the sperm later when you want to become a father.<br>  Regular masturbation promotes a healthy reproductive system as well as a whole list of other benefits.  Progressive thinking health groups are not admitting that masturbation is not to be considered the shameful guilty act it was in my youth.  They are promoting it as healthy activity (I could have told them that years ago).<br>  If you can bare with me for another moment, it sounds like you need some information so you do not have to live out your early adolescence with myths and whispered stories about masturbation.<br>  It will not make you go blind, it will not leave you with hairy palms, there will never be any outward sign that you masturbate, aside from the fact that you are alive, and everybody who is alive masturbates.<br>  You will not ruin or deplete your lifetime supply as it is made in your body throughout your entire life.  You can exhaust your daily supply with multiple masturbation in one day, but a night's rest will fix that up.<br>  Masturbation is a very personal act.  No one wants to walk in on you.  Choose a private place and time where you will not be disturbed.  Don't think that your parents don't know you masturbate.  They are older versions of you, and went through the same urges as you are going through now.

eYBX8yetaa	yeah if ur boobs are pure FAT|`|dyiuwz0qaa	Yes because breasts are made of fat, mostly, and while you lose weights your boobs get smaller.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Yes they usually do...mine went from a D cup to a B cup when I lost 20 pounds....it didnt happen suddenly it happened really slowly and I hardly noticed until my bras got too big.|`|7HBwudViaa	Yes, the first part of your body to loose weight is your breast. <br>  *don't worry that isn't an odd question, I have wondered many times* <br>  :)|`|TXIhaoFEaa	yeah, they should which is why athletes have small breasts since they don't have much fat on their bodies.|`|b60e07f79c44c712de0ab0ea550ce5e5aa	yes|`|5hz1DlqWaa	They stay the same.

ylLdktWoaa	i had the same issue when i first had my period. I didn't want to tell my mom or anything cuz i think it's embarrassing.

aJ1aaOi9aa	birth control!!!<br>  i havent had my period for 2 weeks and that time was the first time i have had in in 5 months! and they are shorter, only last about 3 days.<br>  ammazzinngg! gosh i love b.c.!<br>  i dont think it helps with my headaches though.. :/ lame.wish they did.<br>  <br>  <br>  i have seen many girls get birth control not just to prevent having a baby...but many people i know, their moms were fine with it to make their periods more even.<br>  <br>  also you are 13..this is just the beginning..|`|rQfzifT7aa	When it was like my last few days and I wanted to slow down, I would just take a bath.

It also helps with cramps, acne, not getting pregnant lol...<br>  <br>  it's pretty good stuff all around.
7W9W4G7saa	actually my best friend who is 19 is about your height still and weighs maybe less. she eats more than anyone i know. but her parents aren't skinny. its your metabolism rate that plays in also. as you get older your body will change so give it time. your still going through puberty and your body has a lot of changes that it still needs to go through. <br>  <br>  :-) hope this helps and i'm sure you don't look anorexic! :-)|`|11Vgs45Naa	I'm the same exact way. You have a fast metabolism, so it's so hard to gain weight. During puberty, you will gain a lot of weight.|`|jButcWbdaa	Yes you have the skinny genes, like me. I know you feel awkward now, but you'll fill out a bit more in a few years, but you'll probably always be thin. I bet you'll love it once you're in you reach your twenties and thirties.|`|YodKuYvbaa	you should eat healthy, but if you want to look less anorexic, i would suggest that you go the the gym and see a personal trainer who can make you more muscular (muscle weighs more than fat). don't engorge yourself in food---eat healthy!! And if you can't gain any weight its no big deal. it means your healthy the way you are, and your body is meant to be that way.|`|Dkwqj4Uxaa	You should eat foods like walnuts, salmon, and other healthy foods if you want to have some healthy fat. It is definitely possible! And don't worry too much, 98 pounds is okay for your height. But I think it would be healthy to gain a few pounds if you want to. Good luck!

Since you are already having sex I'm not going to go on and on about why you shouldn't be having sex.  I was older than you but no one could have said anything to stop me at the time.  Are you on birth control?  If you are then good for you.  If not then you need to be.  If you are old enough or mature enough to be having sex then you are old enough or mature enough to go to someone and talk about getting on the pill, patch, shot or whatever your choice is.  You can go to your mother, sister, aunt, friend...whoever you are close to.  If you feel that is not an option then find another reason to go see your doctor and ask them for birth control.  I'm not for telling lies to your parents but I'm still young enough to understand why you would.  If you have a planned parenthood around you can use them or the health department.  Please stay safe, you don't need a baby at 13 and it only takes once.|`|k54YiHIeaa	ok so technically im going to tell you what  i think about this. YOUR A ****** WHORE AND YOU SHOULDNT BE HAVING SEX AT THIRTEEN!!! you could get pregnant. and your probably thinking "well i can get an abortion" if you have atleast 200 dollars and you want to go through that tramma. in an abortion i doubt u know what happens bc when you go to a clinic they dont even tell you. they ****** lie to you so you do it anyway and get money. theres different ways like suction aspiration and saline injections. this is when they force ur cervix open and stick a currette into your vagina and cut up the baby then suck it out with a vaccumm through a tube. if they leave any parts behind like a finger it can get infected and lead to other problems. you can also hemorrage. In saline injection they stick a needle through ur abdomen and inject the amniotic sac with a salt solution that burns the baby alive. then they deliver the dead baby. this is inhumane and ur killing a life. and your so stupid for having sex and not thinking of the consequinces!!!!!!!  like honestly how stupid are people these days. and if you dont get pregnant you can get STDS that can lead to problems and even not being able to concieve.  so really stop being a ********|`|cCXGEZxaaa	I think that's a sign that at thirteen you probably shouldn't be having sex. <br>  Either way I'm hoping you didn't continue that's just plain gross.|`|raKcYQJMaa	i seriously hope you got pregnant, and your life is ruined...seriously think before you do something as serious as sex|`|7Y0a2G6Vaa	Oh my god, more reason for me to fear having a daughter!

dpgXzMenaa	I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|AA10358331	use the website www.letsmaturbate.com <br>  there are a lot of good way for a women to masturbate on there :) I even found a few i like!|`|2vrnakJDaa	Don't insert anything.

Sure, it will feel good, but you will get a lot more pleasure from doing things that work over your clit.<br>  If you have a detachable shower head, try spraying that right on your clit in the shower.<br>  Some girls even lay down while they're filling up the bathtub, getting their clit right under the waterspout.<br>  Otherwise, just rub it with your fingers in any way that feels good.<br>  You can also stick your fingers from your other hand inside you, and don't forget, your anus also has nerves that connect to your sex organs inside.<br>  So try sticking a finger in there as well. But DO NOT stick that inside you without washing it off, or you can get a nasty infection in your vagina!<br>  It's important to remember, wash anything you put inside of you FIRST, and don't put anything in there that's pointed or has sharp ends or angles.<br>  And also try massaging your breasts with your free hand, and/or pinching your nipples.<br>  And remember, you BRAIN is the biggest sex organ! Let your mind go wild and be free to think up any fantasy you want to. It's OK to do that.<br>  You have to relax, be somewhere that you're not worried about someone walking in on you, and also don't feel any guilt at all!!!  It's a totally normal thing to do, and everyone does it!!!<br>  Have fun!|`|jAouwgtlaa	masturbation is fun if you are not ready for sex yet.  and it is completely normal and FUN so if someone is like, "ew you masturbate, you're gross and must be addicted" just be like, "suck it BEEYOTCH."  anyway, a hairbrush is a good time.  IF you have nothing else cause if you're only 14 i'm sure you probably don't have a dildo.  but you will probably find as you do it more that your clit is the most sensitive spot and this is where you get the most pleasure from.  it is EXTREMELY hard to orgasm without clitoral stimulation.  so just like rub it.  until you get off.  you will know.  oh also use a little saliva or water or something cause when it's just skin-on-skin the friction HURTS.

Take your time and enjoy.<br>  Here's How:<br>  <br>     1. Make time for more than a quickie.<br>        Most guys first learn to masturbate in secret and furtive ways. They do it quickly and need to figure out what to do with the evidence afterward. This can create a powerful pattern of masturbating quickly, without paying attention to where your sexual arousal can take you. To start exploring something different, make sure you have some extended time and privacy for yourself, where you aren’t trying to finish quick before someone interrupts.<br>  <br>     2. Turn off the porn (just for a while) and tune into your body.<br>        Not everyone likes porn, but a lot of guys do, and while porn can be great, it also takes you out of your body a bit with the fantasy. This can distract you from what’s actually happening in your body. You don’t need to throw the porn away, but for a few times, masturbate without porn, and objectify yourself for a change!<br>  <br>     3. Do a…dry…run through.<br>        Bad pun aside, it’s a good idea to try the above suggestions, and then just masturbate as you normally would. As you do this pay attention:<br>            * Changes in your breathing: Does it become shallow and quick, slower and deeper?<br>            * Changes in your body: is there tension in some places, and relaxation in others? Is this the same every time you masturbate?<br>            * How does it feel just before you have an orgasm?<br>            * How does it feel as you orgasm, and immediately post-orgasm? <br>  <br>     4. Time to switch it up.<br>        Men learn early in their lives the most effective way to get themselves off. And most never waver from the utilitarian approach to self love. But sex is less like a well oiled machine, and more like a chaotic food fair, where there is an endless selection of ways to satisfy your appetites. So it’s time to throw a wrench in the works and shake up your routine. Try any combination of the following suggestions:<br>  <br>     5. Does your left hand know what your right hand is doing?<br>        Do you always use the same one hand to masturbate? Most guys do. If you’re among them, start with the simple tip of switching hands. It can feel strange at first, the rhythm might be off, it’s almost like sex with someone new for the first time. Enjoy the newness, and see if a new hand can teach an old hand some tricks.<br>  <br>     6. Experiment with positions.<br>        If you aren’t an experimental type, it’s time to start. If you’re used to masturbating lying down on your back, try sitting up. If you normally sit in a chair, try standing, or kneeling. As with all these changes, this might feel ridiculous at first, and you’ll probably go back to old faithful, but see what masturbation feels like in different positions, and notice if it brings with it any new sensations.<br>  <br>     7. Get your hips moving.<br>        The way your body moves when you masturbate is probably very different from the way it moves when you’re having sex with someone else. Many men don’t move at all when they masturbate. Try to move your hips when you masturbate, simulating the thrusting of intercourse. Notice how moving your hips in different ways can bring you closer to, and at times take you farther away from, the point of orgasm.<br>  <br>     8. Use different hand strokes.<br>        Most men learn early on that a vigorous stroke does the trick. This intense up and down stimulation usually ends in a good orgasm. But there are dozens of other strokes that each bring with them different sensations, and different orgasms. Roll your penis in between your hands, moving your hands up and down your shaft. Try using long twisting strokes instead of just up and down. Experiment with different movements, pressures, and speeds.<br>  <br>     9. Explore your shaft.<br>        While most of the nerve endings on the penis are at the head, and specifically the frenulum, many men will have spots on their shaft that are unusually sensitive. Try putting one hand at the base of your penis and press it towards your body while experimenting with different hand strokes along the shaft of your penis. Treat this like a treasure hunt, and try to feel the difference between one side and the other, between stimulation near the base and up near the tip.<br>  <br>    10. Reach around, yourself.<br>        For many men the balls (testicles) are a very sensitive area that responds well to feelings of touch and pressure. Take your forefinger and thumb and make them in a circle at the top of your scrotum. Gently tug on your scrotum as your masturbating. This is both a way to prevent you from ejaculating and a way to extend sexual feelings in your body. Experiment with other kinds of touch including tickling, scratching, and rubbing.<br>  <br>    11. Check out the neighborhood.<br>        While the penis and scrotum tend to be the epicenter of masturbatory attention, if you’re looking to open things up a bit, be sure to take a tour of some other nearby areas. The perineum, the area between the sc|`|WXkTi3JWaa	Pj j gave you way to much useless advice. <br>  <br>  Anyways I like to head over to the Betty Crocker website and then polish off a couple of recipes.|`|AA12022261	i never masterbaided before as the guy above the guy above explained|`|Ov8jbP1Taa	you hold your penis when its hard, and rub it up and down until you orgasm(spit semen from it)|`|uaMvnHEYaa	you spelt masturbate wrong...|`|60SXUwbqaa	you try to suck it *** hole|`|m9ZNsgCBaa	u jack off ( rub ur d***)

See what other people are doing and see if it works for you.  At this point, do anything is good for you, as long as you do it in good form (don't use your back if you're working out your arms, etc), and then do cardio exercises afterwards.  A good rule to work out with is that your basic set should be around 15 repetitions for anaerobic exercises (weight lifting, etc).  You should be tired out after 15 reps.  Then after you're done about 20-30 minutes of anaerobic exercises, do some cardio work, such as running or biking.|`|JCSRSW8paa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  The rules are simple.<br>  <br>  1) Consistancy, setup you work out program and stick to it come what may !

Those symptoms you described could be other things going on. If it persists with home treatment, you will want to get yourself checked out, that way you know for sure. Also, if your suffering from fatigue, that is a disorder itself and want to have it evaluated anyways. Might as well kill two birds with one stone. Please don't ignore it though.|`|NiIPFb40aa	I don't mean to be like people who just want 2 points when they don't know anything.

Have you been sleeping well?  Are you sleeping on an older mattress or in a weird position?  Have you been under unusual amounts of stress lately?<br>  <br>  You are definitely tight no matter what the answers to these questions are.  What I remembered that helped me was Physical Therapy.  I had some ultrasound, massage, heat, and stretching done on me.  It felt wonderful.  As I progressed, I would have the heat put on me first, then they would give me the exercises to do while they supervised.  It then became my responsibility to do them at home.  At the end of a session, I would get a little help on the final stretch as I lay down and allowed the therapist to manipulate my neck.  I would ice down and call it a day.  Within just a few visits, I felt so much better and within 4-6 weeks, I was brand new and the problem did not come back.<br>  <br>  I would suggest making an appointment to see your doctor.  He/She might want x-rays, MRIs or prescribe medication in addition to physical therapy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Feel Better!!

ly0TXATaaa	For size, we're looking at four main things:<br>  <br>    1) Increase the mass of your weight.  In my humble opinion, you're going to need to graduate yourself to a heavier weight than 35 pounds.  I've heard of guys curling 95 pounds, so if you really want the big guns, you're going to have to set your sights all the way up there.<br>  <br>    2) Decrease the the reps and the sets.  It seems like you are making your muscles run a marathon, and have you ever seen the legs of marathon runners?  Even though they can run for 26 miles straight, they have pretty skinny legs!<br>  <br>  For a larger sized muscle, we don't want quantity, we want quality.  That means larger weights, which will mean less reps.  The maximum rep of your largest weight should be 6.  Reps of 8-10 are good for all-around purposes, but if you're going for nothing but size, that's a little high for your maximum weight.<br>  <br>  In my 15 years of reading through muscle books and websites, I've never, ever read of a routine that recommended 12 sets for one particular muscle ar one particular weight.  I would recommend "pyramiding", which in your case would be something like 10 reps of 35 pounds, 8 reps of 45 pounds, 6 reps of 55 pounds, 4 reps of 65 pounds, 6 reps of 55 pounds, 8 reps of 45 pounds, 10 reps of 35 pounds.<br>  <br>    3) Watch your diet.  Make sure you are getting the protein and amino acids your body needs to actually build the muscle.<br>  <br>    4) Get the rest.  Your body does best at the actual repairing of the muscle (muscle building) when you're sleeping, so if you are getting 6-7 hours a night, that's not enough.  To build the muscle, we're going to want something between 8-10 hours a night.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  Good luck!|`|3yiXZ9bnaa	there are different types of bodies.  ectomorphs and 2 others, i dont remember right now. yahoo it.  anyhow, if your anything like me, your muscles are longer and leaner instead of shorter and larger?|`|cWgfavyTaa	well for one your overtraining<br>  2-3 times a week is WAY to much especially for arms<br>  you can do that with big bodyparts like legs or back but not arms and thats not even recommended cuz you can still be overtraining nd<br>  you need to vary your exercises nd<br>  12 sets is to much for biceps<br>  there a very small muscle and need little attention<br>  and thats way to much just for one exercise<br>  people dont even do that for squats or deadlifts<br>  <br>  see if i were you i would do....<br>  <br>  3 sets barbell curls (reps you like)<br>  2 sets dumbell curls(reps you like)<br>  2 sets incline curls(reps you like)<br>  1 or 2 sets of high pulley curls(12-15 reps)<br>  <br>  as my bicep workout<br>  <br>  for triceps..which you should be focussing on more if you want bigger arms since there 2/3 of your arms<br>  get it? tri means 3<br>  its made up of 3 parts<br>  bi means 2<br>  its made up of 2 parts<br>  so its not bs if you think im lying<br>  for triceps i would do...<br>  <br>  decline skullcrushers 3 sets of 4-6 reps<br>  tricep pushdown 2 sets of 10<br>  behind the back tricep pushdown 2 sets of 10<br>  overhead dumbell tricep extension 2 set of 8<br>  <br>  and you should really really really workout your whole body...just dont focus on arms but its your body not mine so i cant tell you what to do<br>  and only do this once a week<br>  idc if you wanna do it more it wont work<br>  and drink whey protein after you workout along with fast digesting carbs like gatorade or white bread<br>  and also have a decently high calorie and clean diet in the 3500-4k range<br>  <br>  nd if you dont wanna workout anything besides arms so you look stupid and deformed<br>  <br>  do triceps on a different day that biceps|`|eFW5O92Yaa	Some people actually have physical informalities which don't allow people to develop certain groups like the others. However this isn't anything of much importance and don't normally show, unless you lift. I really couldn't tell you what's going on though.<br>  <br>  Your routine really isn't healthy though. You should do arm routines twice a week, once every 3 days(in regular routines there's a day break every 6 days). And really you should do several varying excercises for each group. You should do either 4 different excercises for each group with 3 sets for each excercise, or 3 excercises with 4 sets. Your muscles will adapt to a routine and have what they call, a plateau effect. It's when it stops growing because of adaptation, which is why it's important to keep throwing a monkey wrench into the workout and changing it up, stimulating the muscle.|`|ZMyABA8caa	umm dude....If you wanna increase mass....12 sets for 1 exercise is too many sets...do 2-3 sets and about 8-10 reps. Do as much weight as possible in those reps, the last rep in the last set shud be very hard to do, and thats good. You should have bigger biceps after around 1-2 weeks. Increase the weight by 5 or 10 pounds each week or so.

Sometimes we're so stressed out that our body decreases the amount of a hormone (GnRH), which causes us to not ovulate or menstruate. Working with your doctor or midwife can help you figure out what you need to do to relax and get back on schedule.<br>  <br>   Illness<br>  A sudden, short illness or even a longer illness can cause your periods to be delayed. This is usually temporary.<br>  <br>  Change in Schedules<br>  Changing schedules can really throw off your body clock. This is particularly true if you go from days to nights at work or vice versa.<br>  <br>  Change in Medications<br>  Perhaps you're trying a new medication and a delayed or absent period is the cause. Be sure to talk to your doctor or midwife about this side effect. It is very common with some methods of birth control.<br>  <br>   Being Overweight<br>  Carrying around too much weight can hormonally shift your cycles and even stop them. Most women will see a return to normal cycles and fertility with the loss of some weight.<br>  <br>   Being Underweight<br>  If you do not have enough body fat you will not have regular periods, sometimes you can eve cause your periods to stop all together. This is called amenorrhea. Typically a weight gain will help you have your periods return. This is a frequent cause of a missed period in women who work out to an extreme or are professional athletes.<br>  <br>   Miscalculation[<br>  The menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman. While we say that the average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, that is not true for everyone. Sometimes our period is believed to be late when in all actuality we have simply miscalculated. If you have irregular menstrual cycles, but know when you ovulate, look for your period about two weeks after you ovulate. That may help you keep an easier track of your periods.<br>  <br>   Peri-Menopause<br>  Peri-menopause is the period of time where you are transitioning from reproductive age to a non-reproductive age. Your periods may be lighter, heavier, more frequent or less frequent - but mostly just not normal. If you do not wish to get pregnant, be sure to continue to use birth control because you are likely to still be fertile at least some of the time.<br>  <br>  Menopause<br>  Menopause is when you have reached the point in your life where you will no longer ovulate or menstruate. Menopause can be a natural life event or may happen surgically through hysterectomy or through chemical such as chemo therapies.<br>  <br>   Pregnancy<br>  Finally! Yes, your missed period might be because you're pregnant! A simple pregnancy test can usually help you determine if you have missed your period because you are pregnant. The urine pregnancy tests and blood pregnancy tests look for the hormone hCG.|`|zsLEy1IRaa	You're not going to know if your pregnant after only two weeks, have you been working out more lately, are stressed, i mean honestly periods can be irregular unless your on the pill or after pregnancy so really it could just be a fluke, check with your doc for a yeast infection.  Also dont stress yourself out too much until you know for sure your pregnant because you don't want to convince yourself that you are, especially if your not.  Good luck, and use protection lol|`|CJvq5rh7aa	Not to freak you out or anything but after your period you are left with a nice fresh egg for baby making. You are more likely to get pregnant shortly after your period then towards the actual time you get your period..<br>  <br>  And if you aren't on birth control that's no good.

The fact that you are feeling soreness on a particular side of your abdomen could be a symptom of an ectopic pregnancy, which is extremely dangerous. <br>  <br>  Take another HPT, using morning urine and waiting a full 4 or 5 minutes.<br>  If it's still negative, see your OBGYN.

But take heart, I have heard testimonials of people in a similar situation as you and have succeeded in reducing both their body shape and weight. There are certain things you can do if you wish to lose those inches and get into better shape. Losing weight can sometimes be a matter of just changing your normal eating habits to a healthier diet combined with better nutrition.<br>  <br>  For instance your healthy way of eating becomes your healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  A balanced diet is essential to provide your body with all the nutrients to make it function properly. Sometimes according to national statistics we make the wrong decisions and find making healthy choices a challenge.<br>  <br>  Here are just a few key points to optimise your health.<br>  a) you need a balanced diet with colourful fruits and vegetables, lean protein, good carbohydrates and the right amount of good fats.<br>  b) vitamins, minerals and fibre to provide the nitrition missing from your diet that your body needs for good health.<br>  c) regular exercise to condition your heart, relieve stress and to make it easier to maintain a healthy body weight.<br>  d) lastly, try to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day, excluding tea and coffee.<br>  <br>  There are 2 options that may be of interest to you,<br>  <br>  I'm fairly slim but like you there was unwanted flesh around my middle, I weighed just under 11 stone.

Don't eat so little that you're still hungry at the end of the day, but eat significantly less than you have been eating. Don't eat fast food more than once a month, and cut out junk food. Treat yourself once in a while. You will find that you'll stop craving the tastier food, and require less food to feel full after a few weeks of this if you do it right. This is how I recently lost 37lbs and got back to a healthy weight. It will take some will power at first, but it will get much easier after a few weeks and if you don't break the diet too much.<br>  You technically could still eat fast food and junk food and lose weight if you eat small portions, but it is still unhealthy. This will work if you can hold true eating this way. Good luck.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more.

Always watch what you eat, I have never really paid any attention to it but I have started to. Bread has a lot of calories that will have u feel full but it does more bad for you than anything.

211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	I totally know what you are saying!!  I hated my braces sooooooo much!!  I was so happy when they finally came off - but that took 3 years!!  And I STILL have a retainer cemented into the bottom of my front teeth - LOL!<br>  <br>  What I used to do is close my eyes and breathe through my nose.  I used to breathe in and think the word, "RE" and when I exhaled, I thought the word, "LAX."  So, by thinking the word RELAX, I was able to focus on just the word and my breathing.  A lot of times, it really did help.  On bad days, I went home and took some Advil and laid down and cried just like you.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would definitely ask the doctor for some valium to take to help you relax more before going to the office.  Let him/her know that every time you go, you are in terrible pain.  Or, you can ask the opposite... you can ask for medication for after your visit.  I remember when things hurt so bad that I couldn't even sleep at night, he would give me Tylenol 3 with codeine.  It helped with the pain a lot.  Unfortunately, the codeine bothered my belly, but there are other medications on the market that probably won't give you a belly ache.<br>  <br>  Definitely be upfront and honest with the doc.  To get you through tomorrow, think, RE-LAX, and ask him about medications.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Feel Better!  Also - just remember how beautiful you will look when all this is done and over with!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  BTW... How did it go today???

oMpNorCfaa	I've totally been in your situation before.  For me the pain was so severe that I had a migraine for a bit, then woke up again late at night and went to the hospital.  They ended up giving me an IV and a few IV drugs to take care of the immediate pain.  I went home the next morning and made an emergency appointment with a chiropractor.  I had never been to one before and I was so scared but I there was nothing else for me that would fix it.  I have been to a physiotherapist before that but they didn't work as well for me as quickly.  If you can't talk to your parents or doctor about getting an appointment with either of those, you could try:<br>  -Massaging the area to loosen it up, or getting someone to massage it for you<br>  - Actually try ice instead of heat.  That's what my chiropractor told me to do and it helped more than heat.  Or what would be best to try alternating heat and ice every 10-15 minutes<br>  - Take painkillers.  They don't have to be a presciption.  Ibuprofen worked best for me or take Tylenol or a muscle and back relief pill could help too.  Do not take more than the recommended dosage and only take what kind you are comfortable with.  Or if you can get to a doctor they could prescribe you a muscle relaxant that is more likely to work for you.<br>  Good luck!

Managed to lose about 20 lbs quite quickly and kept it off. Didnt really change my diet too much either. I tried some of the other fad diets over the years but didnt really have much luck.

If you get that then the Acia Berry is going to make you feel a lot lighter inisde which was a big relief. The bloated feeling also made me feel so lethargic and tired all the time.

rbBwkdQOaa	Don't use diet pills. They only solve the problem temporarily. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you started to take diet pills and took on unhealthy eating habits and then you stop taking the pills but you keep your old habits? You would be in worse shape then you were before. I would suggest you go to the gym and do cardio or try playing sports if you are worried about your weight. Another good thing to remember to help lose weight and keep it off is to stop eating fast food. Did you know the whopper value meal has about 1,000 calories? that is half of the recommended 2,000 calorie diet in only one meal and most people get refills and desserts and more fries. Fruit are very good for you and can help you lose weight. So there are some tips on how to lose weight and keep it off. And if you are wondering how I know this will work it is because I started doing this about 4 months ago and I had a noticeable stomach and I started lifting weights, doing cardio, eating healthier, and cut  out fast food and I have a 2-pack right now. So this does work you just have to apply yourself and not be lazy so get outside and do something.|`|ogeRU7KEaa	No, this could be very harmful to your health as you are a teenager and still growing.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is absolutely normal for an 18 year old girl to be depressed if she left everything she is accustomed to and went to a new country.  Seven days after I graduated high school, my family moved 1200 miles from where I was raised, and I entered this new community without a friend in the world.  I had no choice but to go with them, or I would have had no where to live and no income.  I was totally depressed and told them as soon as I could get the money I was going back "home".  Well, I got a good job, made new friends, a year later met a great guy, and married him.  Needless to say I never went "home".  That was many years ago (over 30) and I am still in the new town, married to the great guy and have long since gotten over the old depression.  <br>  <br>  Give this new place a chance and I am sure you will build a new life that will be just as great as the old one and you can always go visit "home".<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|7a910fce03d9f12a690e6099acf64e0daa	i think its probably normal. i moved from the southwest USA to the Northeast USA and it was a big change.

We all have days where we are extra hungry and feel like a bottomless pit, every girl has been there, and that's okay! It usually just means your hormone levels are up, your body is craving nutrients it might not be getting enough of and sometimes you're just HUNGRY! <br>  Also, if you were sick, you probably werent moving around alot were you? Because when are moving around less we tend to get more hungry, which is partly psychological. <br>  Also, what you ate is pretty much okay, you got alot of fiber, protein, and fruit. The only thing is you could have had more vegetables.<br>  Don't worry about it, you usually go the gym 4 days a week? Thats quite a bit. Don't feel bad, everyone has a day where they need to be a pig. I mean im sure you enjoyed yourself right? <br>  You'll get back into a lower calorie diet when you're feeling better for sure and when you're back into your regular routine. <br>  And it all leads up to : YES eat when you're hungry. But learn to recognize psychological hunger from real physical hunger!!! Going for a walk or drinking a glass or two of water can make you not hungry anymore and you'll wonder why you wanted food in the first place. Or eating something like a snack like an apple.|`|dbGOxdWIaa	When you are hungry, eat something, then wait for 20 min, then if you were still hungry, eat more.

You are probably working up an appetite.<br>  <br>  Still, have your doctor run some tests to determine if you have either diabetes or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

Finding out for sure if you are or aren't one or the other can be a huge help to you.<br>  <br>  Also, get with a dietician to get a meal plan for yourself.  If you are cleared by your doctor that there is no medical problem, you need to find those foods that will satisfy your hunger AND provide you with good nutrition.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
w2Z1SV1Gaa	I was on trinessa for a month (last month) and it was HORRIBLE! I normally get my bc filled at CVS (they use trisprintec) but decided to switch to Walgreens for the sake of convenience. Walgreens uses trinessa instead of trisprintec. Trinessa gave me horrible cramps, terrible bloating and made me very, very angry for the last 2 weeks of my pack (and I am a verrrry laid back person). My anger and violent outbursts got to the point that it was causing problems between my husband and me. Very bad. I went back to CVS yesterday for a refill of Trisprintec, which has been the best brand I have ever taken...no bloating, no cramps and, most important, no angry, violent behaviors.

LUBn5jtzaa	It just depends on your internal body settings.Your body defaults to feeling hot. Your blood vessels could be a little closer to the surface of your skin, causing the temperature sensors in your skin to feel the heat of your blood. Or your temp sensors could just be extra sensitive to heat. <br>  <br>  I'm the opposite of you...I'm always cold. It can be 75 degrees in a room and I'll be bundled up in several blankets.

AA11522944	It is perfectly normal NOT to be able to retract your foreskin when you are a child. When you are an infant the foreskin is actually attached to the glans (head) of your penis and naturally detaches itself normally somewhere between the age of 5 and 10. Smegma is formed as the foreskin adhesions break down.<br>  <br>  As well as being attached to the glans of the penis the foreskin of a child can also be naturally ‘tight’.  In other words not all boys have a foreskin that is loose and easily retractable even when it has detached from the glans.  It is somewhat normal therefore for the foreskin to require some stretching before it is easily retractable and an inability to retract the foreskin in children does not necessarily indicate a ‘problem’.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is stretched ‘naturally’ when the penis becomes erect or the boy himself manually retracts the foreskin to urinate, wash or masturbate.<br>  <br>  Check out the pics in the link below which shows how a foreskin retracts once detached from the glans and the foreskin is sufficiently loose.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_Foreskin_Retraction_Series.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_For...</a><br>  About 5% of males cannot retract their foreskin by the age of 17.<br>  <br>  Even when the foreskin is fully retractable there should still be a strip of skin called the 'frenulum' attached underneath... this never detaches. See the following link.  <a href="http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm</a><br>  <br>  If it is the frenulum that is stopping your foreskin from pulling back or it seems to be too short you could have a condition known as a ‘frenulum breve’. See these links<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/Glossary/frenulum-breve.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/Glo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.london-urology.co.uk/frenuloplasty.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.london-urology.co.uk/frenulop...</a><br>  <br>  If the foreskin is detached from the glans of your penis but is not fully retractable because the ‘hole’ in your foreskin is too small to allow the glans to come out AND the foreskin does not appear to be stretching over time you may have a condition known as ‘Phimosis’.<br>  <br>  Phimosis is not uncommon and often resolves itself through puberty as the normal practice of masturbation stretches the foreskin to the point where it retracts fully. To stretch your foreskin simply try to retract it a little more each time you shower, urinate or masturbate. Otherwise you can do stretching exercises as describe in the links below.<br>  <br>  You should NEVER force a tight foreskin back when you are erect or hold it back prior to becoming erect. Forcing or holding the foreskin back can hurt and cause injury including ‘Paraphimosis’ where the tight foreskin restricts blood flow to the glans.  <br>  <br>  If your foreskin is very tight, is not stretching or loosening over time, or still feels firmly attached to the head of your penis you should see a doctor.  A doctor can prescribe steroid creams which assist with the stretching process.<br>  <br>  In extreme cases of phimosis circumcision might be recommended but this is usually a last resort. <br>  <br>  Check out the links below<br>  <a href="http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/Factsheet_PenisProblems.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/tight_foreskin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care/boy-care2.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgS_BsYpEJnIQjyQ9xkG4EPg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080704035859AA2gWX8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Agv5irHjawO.lSGw14XGKkTg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080718012622AApCEx8">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|CNW6eAjoaa	I have attached several links with information on foreskin stretching methods that work.  The first link will show and explain how to do the stretches, and the other two are for information.  The more you know about this, the better you will be able to solve the problem.  Follow the stretching routine while taking a daily shower and you should see results in about two weeks.  Full and painless retraction could take 3-4 months.  Then, you will be set for life.  To give you a bit of information on this,...when males are born, their foreskin and glans are fused together by connective tissue (synechia).  This connective tissue breaks down naturally as the child ages and begins to manipulate his penis during urination and later through masturbation.<br>  The bond can break down between the ages of 6-18 years, permiting full and painless retraction.  You might need to pull your foreskin forward, off the end of your glans, away from your body.  This will help to break up the connective synechia and make it easier to retract.<br>  Give the stretches a try.<br>  As an alternative, you can ask a doctor for steroid cream that is made for this purpose.  Do not let the doctor, even hint at circumcision.  It is the last thing you need.  Be very firm and tell them it is not an option.<br>  Good luck with this, and remember to be gentle.  Do not stretch until you feel pain.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	look up foreskin or frenulum stretching excerises and get a steroid cream so the skin loosens up and retracts all the way|`|uclo2Um1aa	steroid cream is a great Idea but also keep trying to retract it. it will go back sooner or later.
wwRbkCMraa	Whey protein is safe and is already in many of the things you are probably eating daily. Did u know it's in Cheeze it crackers, candy bars, pop tarts and many other foods, including almost all dairy products like yogurt, milk, cheese etc. Baby food has whey protein, The protein in milk is 20% whey, so whey in its concentrated form should be perfectly fine at any age as long as you are not lactose intolerant.  Next time you are at the store look at the label on some baby formula.  Even that has whey protein in it.  Start reading labels and you will see many foods that contain whey, and are safe at any age.

wwP3ONCFaa	Fever itself is not an illness—it's a symptom of one. In fact, it's one of the body's defense mechanisms against infection. And fever may even serve a useful purpose: shortening an illness, increasing the power of antibiotics, and making an infection less contagious. These possibilities should be weighed against the discomfort involved in letting a slight fever run its course,<br>  <br>  feeling the need to extra relief is all you need:<br>  Liquefy your assets. When you're hot, your body perspires to cool you down. But if you lose too much water—as you might with a high fever—your body turns off its sweat ducts to forestall further water loss. That makes it more difficult for you to cope with your fever. The moral of this story: Drink up, mateys, or your ship will be sunk. In addition to plain water, I recommend you to take Fruit and vegetable juices.<br>  <br>   These are high in vitamins and minerals, I particularly favor nutrient-dense beet juice and carrot juice. If you're thirsty for tomato juice, choose one that is low in sodium.<br>  <br>  Sponge off. Evaporation also has a cooling effect on body temperature, I recommend cool tap water to help the skin dissipate excess heat. Although you can sponge the whole body,pay particular attention to spots where heat is generally greatest, such as the armpits and groin area. Wring out a sponge and wipe one section at a time, keeping the rest of the body covered. Body heat will evaporate the moisture, so you don't need to towel off.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|SYpVGGJTaa	A fever IS an indication that your body is fighting an infection however there can be negative effects on your body from the fever itself. Your body will continue to fight the infection even after you take a fever reducer but you will be less likely to become dehydrated etc.|`|PBBtIrPDaa	You are 100% correct.  A fever is the body's defense against viruses, bacteria, etc., which are killed by heat.  Personally, I have rarely treated myself or my children for fever.  I keep a watchful eye on what their temp is to make sure it does not rise too high, but other than that, I let the fever run its course.  Stay hydrated.  Eat if you feel hungry, it's not going to hurt, but make sure you are taking in alot of fluids.  A fever will dehydrate you.  Prescribing acetaminophen or ASA for a fever, in my book, is ridiculous.  The only reason that it is done is for ease of aches and pains and to make you more comfortable and allow you to do activities, like work or school.  Your body needs to rest.  That is why we feel like crap when we are sick.  Be diligent.  Keep an eye on your temp.  It should break after a day or two.  If not, see your doctor.  Also be aware of any additional symptoms that may be more serious, stiffness in neck, headache, other symptoms of meningitis.  But, if you are sure it is just a cold or flu, just get lots of rest, drink clear fluids (water, juice, soup broth, chicken soup), and let your body heal itself.  The Tylenol will not have any detrimental effects, but most people find that they are sick longer if they keep lowering their temperature, as the body has a harder time fighting the virus.  Laughter is also great when you're sick.  Watch some comedy.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	Your right. The Fever is the body over heating, killing the invaderz.<br>  <br>  But tylonol may help.

It thrives between the crease in the skin between the thigh and your ball sack.<br>  <br>  Radio waves that were able to do damage to fungus or bacteria would also be capable of doing damage to your gear.

TVzA5WE8aa	I normally do not recommend people to take ACNE products because they are just waste of money and time.<br>  All you should do is to consume a healthy diet and balance your self with variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grain.<br>  Most importantly, food that contains high in ZINC can help a lot with your acne.<br>  Do not consume junk food as your sneak, go for something organic or water instead. Because most of the time when you feel hungry, all you need is a bottle of water and you will find full again. You don't need "food" to save you in this case.<br>  <br>  Just eat a healthy balance of food.

Try to put down the Pepsi.<br>  3) Exercise. This cleans out the oil in your pores. But be sure to take a shower after.<br>  4) Always let your face air-dry. Don't wipe it with a towel or face-cloth. (if you don't have time to air-dry,  take a CLEAN towel and pat-dry.)<br>  5) Don't use conditioner. Conditioner clogs your pores. If you have to use it, only use it on the tips of your hair.<br>  6) Eat a spoonful of honey every morning.<br>  7)  NEVER touch your face. If you have to touch your face, always wash your hands. With SOAP.<br>  8) After you take a shower, before you get out, turn the cold water on. And put your face under the cold water for about a minute.  This closes your pores.<br>  9) Try not to wear make-up. It doesn't matter if it says "dermotoligist recommended" or anything.  Less make up, the better your skin.<br>  10) On ocassion, I take a orange and squeeze some of the juice onto my skin and let it dry. When I wash my face at night, it comes right off. This works great for acne scars.<br>  11) Have back acne? Take Head and Shoulders (yes, the shampoo) and wash your back with it. The longer you keep it on your back the better. (do this in the shower though)<br>  12) Have a cell phone? Or even use a regular phone? Try to disenfect it every now and then. Esepecially when you talk on it and press it directly against your skin.

BUI2nlUVaa	You know what I don 't understand, why it is that you actually think you're funny.  As mentioned numerous times before people are suffering and dying from Lupus every day.  It is a terrible disease.  God forbid that someone in your life, a loved one, actually gets diagnosed with Lupus.  <br>  <br>  Why not just come in here and say "is it leukemia" or is it "breast cancer".  You are a complete and utter douche.  I would suggest you move out of your mom's basement, clear up the acne, lose some weight, and actually try to find yourself a real, live girl, instead of playing World of Warcraft all day.|`|7Os9oipBaa	yeah.|`|dxDSrpCbaa	Lupus has to do with your blood cells. it can cause kidney failure if not treated  and all kinds of problems. there are treatments that your dr, can give you.|`|0KaKKAskaa	Nah, you just ate too many fish burritos.|`|f213b7fc9e8602b480155beec23c700faa	Yes. too bad for u
Rx31LHjbaa	If you didn't have sex (penis in vagina) you didn't lose your virginity.|`|7a910fce03d9f12a690e6099acf64e0daa	haha theres no test for virginity... its simple, if youve had intercourse then your not a virgin. if you havent had it, then your a virgin. if hes touched you its the same as if youve masturbated by yourself... your still a virgin. and it doesnt matter if your hymen is broken, it all depends on if he's put his weenie in your hole.|`|k54YiHIeaa	you only use your virginity if you engage in sex|`|nOrWOZU4aa	There is a way to test that at a doctors office, but riding a bike can break the hymen and make it look like you've had sex.  Darker blood usually means older blood.  Bright red blood is new blood.  So after the boyfriend's visit, that was blood from before.
7W9W4G7saa	For me the pill didn't do anything to my body except regulate my period and stop cramps. i didn't gain weight and my boobs didn't grow. while for some people it may increase both weight and breast size mine did not. if anything it kept me from over eating.|`|7xc8jgLXaa	it can (and that's not even guaranteed) but it's usually only a temporary response. When your body adjusts to the hormones in the birth control (or you stop taking it, whichever comes first), they typically go back to the way they were.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	i have heard of it doing tht to you.|`|nOrWOZU4aa	The theory is that when you take the pill, the hormones mimic a first month of pregnancy, so your body thinks it is pregnant and won't drop an egg.  So, whatever weight gain you would gain in a first month of pregnancy is what the pill would also give you.  For some women, it is more of an abdominal swelling and some an all over weight gain.  I took the pill for years and I noticed no swelling or weight gain.
wdriR7SAaa	No that isn't too much at all. At 5"6 and 18 (if ur a girl you should weight about 120-140.shoot to weigh like 130-that's perfect. Food wise you should eat like 2,000 calories a day. A goal day would be:<br>  B: cereal-like 1 cup. not sugar cereal<br>  good cereals are: raisin bran, special K, cheerioes, total, smart start, 1% or 2% milk, berries or banana<br>  S: Apple<br>  L: peanut butter sandwich, 6oz dannon fruited yogurt<br>  S: fruit, granola bar<br>  D: salom, asparagus, brown rice (like a cup cooked)<br>  S: 3 oreo cookies, grapes (like 25)|`|SWfGkyloaa	I think you have an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  If you eat this way and you are worried about it, you should start looking for some psichological help, it is not too much food.|`|LMHpNsipaa	The ice cream is the only negative thing I see here. A fudgesicle and a medium pinkberry is a typical day? I can understand if it's maybe once in a while, but not on a typical day.<br>  <br>  Try to cut back on the sweets. Peanut butter can also be unhealthy because many of them contain hydogenated or partically hydrogenated oils--which are really bad for you! So go for the organic peanut butter--it is very healthy and tasty. Always use whole grain bread or some other type of grain. White bread is basically junk. It is refined, unnutritional nonsense.<br>  <br>  Oatmeal is very good.<br>  <br>  By the way, it is not like you need to lose weight lol. Just look at it as eating healthier and possibly loosing weight along the way, rather than making it your absolute goal to lose weight.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Woops sorry..I shouldn't have assumed that that's what you eat in a typical day. But either way, just know that you shouldn't have ice cream too often!|`|5ba03d6093a9662261b1c4f424a27942aa	If you want to really drop that weight i would say eat absolutely nothing but water for the first three to four hours after you get up...and the last three to four hours before you go to bed....other than that eat whatever you would like, like you are during the rest of the day...this will teach you balance, self control moderation!!! 135 to 140 is a very healthy normal good weight though so dont stress out too much about it!|`|e7mhjF7Waa	If you excercise alot then what your eating isnt too much youll be fine just excercise like go to the gym and workout and stuff and eventually youll loose the weight
FAf1y4Q5aa	I lost a good bit of waight by admitting to myself I had an addiction to food!!! I didnt diet per say but I changed the psychology of the way I ate. It was hard but I adopted quite a few principals from AA and it really helped me I just changed the alcohol part of the program to food.<br>  <br>  for example if I really wanted to eat junk I would say ok....I WILL deffenately go to Mcdonalds and get a double cheese burger tonight if I find that I cant make it through the day without one and more often then not by the end of the day I actually didnt want one. It is a total snow ball effect once you start turning the food down it just starts getting easier!!! Its really hard and your not alone!!! it terrible the kind of power food has!!! the hardest part about an addiction to food is you have to fight it EVERYTIME you put something in your mouth!!!<br>  <br>  One tip...take you fav. snack food and put it in your fridge except...wrap it up in a whole bunch of seran wrap...I mean like a crazy excessive amount that way in order to eat it you have to unwrap it.....this will give you a bunch of time to really ask yourself "am I doing this to take away hunger? or for no real actual reason other then just to eat?" <br>  <br>  its total mental warfare!!! figure out your eating trigers and take it one day at a time (or if your like me...one minute lol) GOOD LUCK!!! feel free to e-mail me if you want to know some of the little mental tricks I had.....I lost 30 lbs with nothing but learning abut myself and I really do feel great!!!|`|FxAD44Moaa	stop eating processed foods..     they're low in minerals, vitamins and packed with chemically empty calories...<br>  <br>  <br>  that's why you are hungry,  you're starving yourself FAT.<br>  <br>  <br>  why not eat right..?   it can't be that hard.<br>  <br>  <br>  fresh fruits and veggies...    that's how i do it..|`|qZOuxR1Raa	keep yourself busy. the more your mind is on the foods your not eating, the more you'll crave them. Just keep yourself busy with other things and try not to think about itt. When your mind is in other places, you don't Even have time to be hungry. Also, don't stop eating, just cut down. For example, instead of getting a largee coke, get a small. Just eat smaller portions of foodd. Oh and when your eating, chew your food many times before swallowing. It helps you digest food quicker wich is healthy and it also makes yer meal last longer and that'll keep you full longer.|`|Z6sCMskNaa	Just try and resist the urge to buy a lot of food.

I find it hard to believe that the doctor would be FORCING her to carry it to full term, but the doc is probably strongly advising her to not have another abortion due to the state of her reproductive organs (PURELY SPECULATION)|`|jfmftlcNaa	the girl shouldn't have been so careless/reckless<br>  <br>  not only do i personally disagree with abortion (you are killing a baby.... come on), but she also must have no consideration at all for the gravity of sex and getting pregnant<br>  <br>  and she is not even out of high school? <br>  <br>  that's just wrong......<br>  <br>  In terms of your actual question, most likely since she has done it so many times (idiot) she probably for health/physical reasons can't do it again--- it takes a toll on your body, sometimes mentally too.....<br>  <br>  It's not like the law limits the amount of times you can get an abortion, so if that story is true, it must be some medical thing.<br>  <br>  here is my closing note - don't be like this girl. have some respect for yourself, sex, and the product (a child/person) that is created from this act<br>  <br>  also, not only would i say don't get an abortion because i don't support it, but you should realize how damaging (mentally is mainly what i am talking about here) it can be for some women--- they constantly are haunted by/think of the child that they didn't allow to live<br>  <br>  not trying to preach here, and hopefully i included an answer within here, but there are some things that people have to know/do|`|AUOp1j5Saa	1) She probably hasn't had 5+ abortions unless she's filthy rich and daddy pays for them all, which I highly doubt any parent, regardless of social-economic class would do. Abortions cost an upwards of 300 bucks, usually more. She's not getting them on a whim and what you're hearing is most likely just teenage gossip. Its rumors like these that perpetuate lies and falsities about abortion.<br>  <br>  2) No, she cannot technically be denied an abortion under law; however, any particular individual medical practitioner can refuse to perform the procedure on moral or religious grounds. The government cannot say she is not allowed to have an abortion, in other words, but a doctor can refuse to perform one.
18ypsv0oaa	That is a LOT of water. Its been shown to be a myth that water will help you feel fuller. Water is great but you are drinking 2.5 times as much as is recommended.<br>  <br>  You actually need more food so that you that your body doesn't go in to starvation mode and hold on to the pounds instead of losing.<br>  <br>  You need some milk in there to keep your bones and other body parts healthy. I suggest Fat Free or eat pudding or fat free yogurt.<br>  Great that you are having fruit and veggie burger but you need to bump up your servings of veggies.<br>  <br>  You also need whole grains.<br>  <br>  Also, eating the same thing every day will get boring real fast and make you more likely to quit. Weight loss should not be more than average of 2lbs /week. so You are looking any where from 38 weeks to a year and 1/2 to get the weight off in healthy manner and keep it off. Having a strict boring diet won't work.<br>  <br>  Give it a try.<br>  If you want to lose the weight and eat real foods join weight watchers. Guys go to the meetings too and become quite popular for doing so. Guys lose way faster than women on weight watchers and it seems pretty easy for them.  Going to meetings really helps but you can also do it online. Your lose 3x as much weight if you go to meetings.|`|lPnjjFkjaa	It's hard to say exactly how many calories/weight you'd burn.

Heat is what brings out the oils that make you high. I chew on the stems as well when I'm smoking. Just make sure you don't cook it in a place where you don't want to get caught.

F86Ef0vhaa	Definitely you need to talk to someone - parents, school counselor, mental health expert - or all of the above. You need a medical exam, not just a mental exam, because there are physical conditions that can cause emotional disturbances. You describe things consistent with depression, and with paranoia, and you don't have to feel this way. There is help and you aren't alone. You need to talk to someone who can understand and help you. I'm listing a website below that has links to self-assessments for depression, which is, by the way, the most common mental health problem in the US, so know that when you ask for help, there will people who know how to do that. Good luck!|`|lOfRbA54aa	This may just be the ordinary pain of adolescence. Emotions are extremely heightened at your age. Everything feels far more drastic than it is.<br>  <br>  Then again, it may be that you truly are depressed. I know that I was at your age, but wasn't diagnosed until my mid-twenties. I went through a lot of years feeling miserable, unmotivated, near suicidal at times, and not once did it occur to me that I might actually be depressed and not just "a bit down."<br>  <br>  If I were you, the first thing I'd do is talk to my GP about it. Medical doctors have basic training in mental health and, if they feel it is appropriate, can refer you to the proper services to help you through your troubles. There may even be some appropriate benefit scheme to help pay for counseling should you need it.|`|xj0lVyPraa	Talk to your parents and look into seeing a doctor/psychiatrist. <br>  <br>  As for my assessment. You're young and having trouble understanding the fact that you might be differant than the average person.

Psychologists state that depression is a unhealthy state which we 'can' work through in order to experience greater levels of happiness. Some who daily experience deep chronic depression may require both medication prescribed by a Psychiatrist along with 'Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy {M.B.C.T.') provided by Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapists and there are some who experience chronic-but not deeply chronic depression who work well with M.B.C.T. alone. Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD along with Psychologists Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal have authored an excellent self-help book called: "The Mindful Way through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness". Mindfulness, a simple yet powerful way of paying attention to your most difficult emotions and life experiences, can help you break the cycle of chronic unhappiness once and for all, that you may experience greater levels of happiness. In 'The Mindful Way through Depression', it is explained why our usual attempts to "think" our way out of a bad mood or "just snap out of it" leads us deeper into the downward spiral of depression. Through very insightful lessons-drawn from both Mindfulness and Cognitive Therapy - Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD and Psychologists- Mark Williams, John Teasdale, and Zindel Segal demonstrate how to sidestep the negative habits that lead to unhappiness and despair, including self-blame and rumination so you can effectively face life's challenges with much resilience.

GXiCrhVYaa	It's impossible to buy real acai berry unless you live in South America. Elsewhere, all you can get are powders and freeze dried versions of acai in liquid form. Do these do any good? It's hard to say. Please note that acai is NOT a weight loss product. That's just a marketing scam.<br>  <br>  I am on a  mission to warn people about acai SCAMS online. One scam is Acai Berry Supreme. They promised me a free bottle and I would only have to pay shipping. I noticed an additional $29.95 added to my credit card from that company and had to complain to the company to get a refund. Then they started shipping me more bottles and trying to charge me for them.<br>  <br>  Another scam is Acai Berry Power 500, which also offered a free trial bottle. They then started mailing me additional bottles of acai without my permission. Again, I had to complain to the company to get credit card charges removed.<br>  <br>  Also beware of people trying to sell you acai products on YA. Be cautious about people warning you of scams and then directing you to their website to buy their acai products.<br>  <br>  If you are still interested in acai, your best bet is to go to almost any health food or vitamin store and buy acai products directly. I have NO financial ties to Sambazon, but they are the most well-known and reputable companies selling acai. Best of luck.|`|FONamjzIaa	Dude or dudette :) just get monavie! its waaaaay better/healthier than the capsule and its low cal.

I have also notice some wieght gain which is an added plue :)However it is not a pill it is a juice. There are 3 different types of juice you can purchase through Monavie.

The repetitive chewing motion can tighten muscles and bring on a tension headache<br>  -Salt intake. High salt intake can trigger migraines in some people<br>  -Not eating on time. Skipping or delaying meals can cause headaches two ways. A missed meal can cause muscle tension, and, when blood sugar drops from lack of food, the blood vessels of the brain tighten. When you eat again, they expand, leading to headache<br>  -Nitrates. You're certainly not losing out on nutrition and you may spare yourself a headache. Hot dogs, like luncheon and other cured meats, contain nitrates. And nitrates dilate blood vessels, which can mean big-time head pain<br>  -Chocolate. It contains tyramine, a chief suspect in causing headaches<br>  -Nuts. They cause tyramine as well<br>  -Smoking. smoking with the car windows down when you're driving in heavy traffic gives you a double dip of carbon monoxide.

eawDlYHnaa	well people get acne in different times of their life's for different reasons. id recommend seeing a dermatologist bc they can prescribe you good creams that work fast. you should also watch what you eat. the unhealthy, greasy foods will show more than if you ate salads, veggies, fruits, chicken. drink loads of water so you skin can flush itself out and give a healthy appearance. as for now, my dermatologist recommended Neutragena face wash and i've been using it for like 5 years now. another good but expensive brand is biore- i keep a tube of scrubbing face wash in my shower. <br>  remember to NOT pick bc that leaves scars and KEEP your hands off your face. a girlfriend recently told me to put vitamin e on your scars and this will help make them go away without causing breakouts. you can buy this in fluid or pill form and just break open the pills.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Milk and Lime.

But I did find that washing face with soap and water just one time a day, drinking lots of water, taking a multivitamin daily, and not touching my face with my hands all helped.|`|ANsznbWsaa	It's not just puberty that can cause pimples.

KPtrfsEYaa	I wear running shoes for everything.  Who has the money to buy a different pair of shoes for every workout routine?  I workout 5 times a week.  I run and do strength training.  I have never had a problem wearing running shoes to do all.  I also take different classes once in a while.  As long as they are a good pair of running shoes, you should be fine.|`|5Eh125uAaa	For weight training running shoes should be fine, but for aerobics you may have some issues depending on what kind of aerobics. <br>  Running shoes have grips that may not let you do your aerobics smoothly enough, especially if its a wood/smooth floor. This may cause your knees to hurt/bend in weird directions sometimes.<br>  I started jazzercise a couple of years back and used my running shoes. I always had knee problems, then one day my instructor explained cross training/aerobic shoes and I went and got one. Never had any knee pain or ankle injury after that. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Cheers!|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	They should do fine. Running puts tremendous impact on your knees where aerobics is low impact.<br>  <br>  Your feet won't care what you are wearing.
CciXZNYraa	Eat nutritious foods that are high in calories. Examples are whole-grain breads, vegetables such as avocados and potatoes, kidney beans, lean red meat, poultry and fish. <br>  <br>  Increase the caloric value of your meals. Add powdered milk to casseroles for added calories, add avocados and olives to sandwiches, add wheat germ to your cereal, add chopped meat to your pasta sauce, and so on. <br>  <br>  Avoid skipping meals. Knowing how to gain weight involves consistent eating. Eat three meals a day and at least two snacks. <br>  <br>  Increase your normal portion size. Take a second scoop of pasta, or add two bananas to your oatmeal. <br>  <br>  Choose higher-calorie foods when given a choice. For example, corn is higher in calories than green beans. <br>  <br>  Relax - excessive fidgeting and restlessness can burn up a lot of calories. <br>  <br>  Add weight lifting to your exercise program. It helps build muscle mass. <br>  <br>  Balance your caloric intake with the number of calories you're burning. You need to be taking in more than you use up, and you may need to ease up a little on your exercise program.|`|8SRjELNBaa	You obviously haven't given an ounce of effort into googling "body building"<br>  <br>  Give it a shot.. try it.<br>  <br>  I dare you.|`|IXmWVcimaa	Ya twice a week aint going to cut it and just cause you dont look like you've gained muscle doesnt mean you havnt. If you want to get big lots of muscle you should be drinking "whey".  Be warned if you only work out 2 days a week DONT drink it cause you will just get fat and gain little muscle. Not saying you have to do this but this is what I do; I workout 5 times a week (not saying that you have to) on each day i work out a different part of my body and do cardio everyday. But i also workout for atleast an hour and a half a day. I'm not a personal trainer or anything but i know how to get things done. Also if you do start working out for 1 hour or more and atleast 4 times a week I recommend buying some L-Glutamine Powder or a different type of Amino Acid but in a drinkable form. Pills are the lazy way out. Glutamine should help your muscles repair faster. The reason why 2 days isnt enough is, When you workout your muscles tear which is why they hurt when you first start working out if you only workout 2 days your letting them repair almost fully not leaving much room for improvement.If your working out like 4-6 days (not saying you have to everybody's body is different) they are tearing and repairing on the go so your muscles are saying "hey we need to make more muscle to handle the load".The amino acid is to help repair the muscle sorry I didnt post It where I should of. Everyone works out differently one thing might work for 1 person well another plan works for someone else and not that 1 person. Seems 2 days a week isnt cutting it.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	stop wasting money on pills, if you have to take a supplement then use shakes.  Lifting twice a week will never make you gain mass.  If you are trying to build muscle you could go up to 6 times a week, every day training a different set of muscles.  Do some research and get a plan going. right now you are just wasting your time|`|vnOViworaa	Forget pills, just eat healthy.<br>  <br>  Go 4 times a week, do few repetitions (around 6) at 90-100% of your maximum capacity.

cdt4F6ZWaa	Congrats on your weight loss! I'll bet that since your weight loss you have more energy.  And you must be looking better, and feeling pretty great about yourself!!  Your looks aside, your health is the most important thing here. You have to think of your weight loss as something that can most likely prolong your life, first and foremost. There's nothing wrong with you; people of all body types go through phases of eating healthily and exercising, then not exercising for a couple days. It's perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  Look at the reasons you wanted to lose weight in the first place, other than your health being the most important.  What motivated you a year ago? Keep that motivation with you...whether you wanted to look better in clothes, or wear certain outfits, or just feel better.  Stick with your new healthier diet....I'm sure you have gotten used to eating healthier foods.  To keep your weight off, try to remember that much of the food out there is junk, and over-processed.  And the reason many people stay overweight is because they eat those foods.  Stick to that diet and you won't think of yourself as overweight anymore, now it's time to think like a thin person.<br>  <br>  Even if you can't go to the gym, warm weather will be here soon and you can always either go walking or running for exercise.  Even just 20 minutes to a half hour a day can maintain your weight.  Just picture yourself in a fabulous new summer outfit...because you WILL be able to wear them!!|`|yrx6GxDcaa	Not knowing anything about you it would be hard to say what motivates you. What motivated you in the beginning. A weight problem is usually a feeling one has of him or her self image. If you feel good about what you are doing which you should you need to find something that drives you to do the best at what you are trying to accomplish. I was a smoker the only thing that made me think about what i was doing was not to have the joy of seeing my kids grow up and be there for them. Your weight plays a big part in your health to as you get older. Ask your self what is is that you want what is your weight keeping you from there has to be a pay off somewhere in all this. I wish you the best of luck what ever the reason it has to be for you.

HwcVowKGaa	If you want to lose weight, ignore all those things.  Concentrate on eating 2-3 meals every single day; my rule of thumb is to never feel starving.  When you start to feel a little hungry, get a snack or make a meal.  But the most important thing is to exercise well.  If you do things like running, pushups, crunches, or anything that you don't actually use extra weight you should do those every day.  Don't lift weights 2 days in a row, though; your muscles need at least 36 hours to recover properly from tearing them down the day before.  <br>  <br>  Anyway... good diet + exercise = your body's ideal weight, and I wouldn't worry too much about what you eat :)|`|WlZ66KnZaa	Depends on what diet youre on. Low calorie diets work the fastest and you just minimize cals (a 1200 diet is the lowest you should go but works) and low carbs (are basically just protein, harder to stick to, more expensive, and take longer to work). Sugars you minimize since sugar leads to diabetes and other health problems. Fat is also good to minimize since it causes health problems.

Dont want too many of either. good fats you want. not the bad kinds|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Well, kind of pay attention to everything- too much carbs, sugar, fats will be unhealthy for you in the long run. <br>  <br>  But in order to lose weight you need to cut/burn calories, that is absolutely the most important thing.

She was meeting this lad who was in sixth form, and supposedly the `sex god` of the school.  They were like the schools hot couple and everybody thought that they had s*x often, but in actual fact, she planned to have it one night after school, they had both agreed on the date, and then she came on all of a sudden last lesson of the day and she had nothing on her, so she had to go to the shop to buy some tampons with him, and he was horrified, and then she said that she couldn't do it mentally with him, so she had quite a horror story.|`|gexz9Dk8aa	ok, first time i got my perios, as stupid as it seems and as manytimes as i had heard it, i thought there was something wrong with me! yeah, anyway, i ignored it. -.- stupid i know. anyway, my family and i had to go to the airport to pick up my grandparents, who were visiting from overseas. and as much as i tried to ignore the blood, it just kept coming! so we went to my aunnties house to have dinner, and i.. cleaned up a little. but no pads. Besides the blood had gone EVERYWHERE. then we went to my other uncles house, and i spent the night there while the rellies were talking.. lets just say it as uncomfortable. After that, i told m mum i;d started, ut i never told her about it. too embarrassing. although she must've found something, cuz she does the laundry.<br>  <br>  Also, once at school, i gess it mustve leaked, cuz i stood up from my chair, nd there was blood al over it. By some divine, heavenly mracle, and i have no idea how, there was no, and i mean, NO blood on the dress. I still to this day havnt figured out how that happened. ran to the toilet, cleaned up went to class SHAKING LIKE A LLEAF. thnk god it was second last period.... no pun intended.

(This effectively takes the pressure off of them.) <br>  <br>  Reinforce your negative self-perceptions, encouraging you to be guilt ridden and self-judgmental for their benefit. <br>  <br>  Build a case with moral absolutes to convince you of the ``right way'' to do things, avoiding that negative feeling of guilt for themselves. <br>  <br>  Set up situations for you in which you will believe your alternatives are limited to that which results in the least sense of guilt. <br>  <br>  Feign or fake hardship, illness, discomfort, unhappiness, incompetence, or other negative behavior to arouse your sense of guilt and have you take over those tasks, or duties bringing imagined negative consequences for them<br>  <br>  Threaten negative consequences, like going to jail, to the hospital, to the juvenile detention center, failing school, dying, or divorcing you. This manipulation uses your guilt to benefit them..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What can guilt do to you?<br>  Guilt can:<br>  <br>  Make you become over responsible, striving to make life ``right.'' You overwork. You over give of yourself. You are willing to do anything in your attempt to make everyone happy. <br>  <br>  Make you over conscientious. You fret over every action you take as to its possible negative consequence to others, even if this means that you must ignore your needs and wants. <br>  <br>  Make you over sensitive. You see decisions about right and wrong in every aspect of your life and become obsessed with the tenuous nature of all of your personal actions, words, and decisions. You are sensitive to the cues of others where any implication of your wrong doing is intimated. <br>  <br>  Immobilize you. You can become so overcome by the fear of doing, acting, saying, or being ``wrong'' that you eventually collapse, give in, and choose inactivity, silence, and the status quo. <br>  <br>  Interfere in your decision making. It is so important to always be "right'' in your decisions that you become unable to make a decision lest it be a wrong one. <br>  <br>  Be hidden by the mask of self denial. Because it is less guilt inducing to take care of others first, instead of yourself, you hide behind the mask of self denial. You honestly believe it is better to serve others first, unaware that "guilt'' is the motivator for such "generous'' behavior. <br>  <br>  Make you ignore the full array of emotions and feelings available to you. Overcome by guilt or the fear of it, you can become emotionally blocked or closed off. You are able neither to enjoy the positive fruits of life nor experience the negative aspects. <br>  <br>  Be a motivator to change. Because you feel guilt and the discomfort it brings, you can use it as a barometer of the need to change things in your life and rid yourself of the guilt. <br>  <br>  Be a mask for negative self belief. You may actually have low self-esteem, but claim the reason for your negativity is the overwhelming sense of guilt you experience. <br>  <br>  Mislead or misdirect you. Because many irrational beliefs lie behind guilt, you may be unable to sort out your feelings. It is important to be objective with yourself when you are experiencing guilt; be sure that your decisions are based on sound, rational thinking. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What irrational beliefs or negative self-scripts are involved in guilt?<br>  I do not deserve to be happy. <br>  <br>  I am responsible for my family's (spouse's) happiness. <br>  <br>  There is only one ``right'' way to do things. <br>  <br>  It's bad to feel hurt and pain. <br>  <br>  My children should never suffer in their childhood like I did in mine. <br>  <br>  My kids should have more material things than I did. <br>  <br>  It is my fault if others in my life are not happy. <br>  <br>  If my kids fail in any way, it's my responsibility. <br>  <br>  It is wrong to be concerned about myself. <br>  <br>  People are constantly judging me, and their judgment is important to me. <br>  <br>  It is important to save face with others. <br>  <br>  It is wrong to accept the negative aspects of my life without believing that I am responsible for them myself. <br>  <br>  I am responsible if either positive or negative events happen to the members of my family.<br>  <br>  I must not enjoy myself during a time when others expect me to be in mourning, grief, or loss. <br>  <br>  You must never let down your guard; something you're doing could be evil or wrong. <br>  <br>  I must always be responsible, conscientious, and giving to others. <br>  <br>  How others perceive me is important as to how I perceive myself. <br>  <br>  No matter what I do, I am always wrong. <br>  <br>  I should never feel guilt. <br>  <br>  If you feel guilt, then you must be or have been wrong. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Suggested steps to overcome guilt<br>  Step 1:   You can recognize the role guilt is playing in your life by choosing a current problem and answering the following questions in your journal:<br>  <br>  a .    What problem is currently troubling me? <br>  <br>  b .   Who is responsible for the problem? <br>  <br>  c .    Whose problem is it, really? <br>  <br>  d .   What did I do to make this problem worse for myself? <br>  <br>  e .    How much guilt do I feel about this problem? <br>  <br>  f .    How much does the guilt I experience exaggerate or exacerbate my problem? <br>  <br>  g .    If I felt no more guilt what would my problem look like then? <br>  <br>  If the answer to question ``g'' is that your problem can be solved by reducing guilt, go to Step 2. <br>  <br>  Step 2:   Redefine your problem with the absence of guilt as an issue. <br>  <br>  In answering the questions in Step 1 you recognized that guilt was preventing resolution of the problem. To redefining your problem, answer the following questions in your journal: <br>  <br>  How insurmountable is the problem? <br>  <br>  Is this problem an interpersonal or intrapersonal problem?<br>  <br>  If it is interpersonal: Can I help the other person and myself to set aside guilt and resolve this problem? <br>  <br>  If it is intrapersonal: Can I set aside guilt or the fear of it and resolve this problem? <br>  <br>  Does this problem have more than one solution? Can others and myself experience satisfaction, comfort, and resolution with a minimum of debilitating guilt? <br>  <br>  Whose problem is it, really?<br>  <br>  Is it my problem or another(s)? <br>  <br>  Am I taking on another's responsibility? <br>  <br>  Am I trying to keep another from experiencing pain, hardship, or discomfort? <br>  <br>  Step 3:  If the problem is really someone else's, give the problem back to the person(s) to solve and to deal with. <br>  <br>    If the problem is yours, go to Step 4. <br>  <br>  Step 4:   You must confront the real or imagined guilt or fear of guilt preventing you from either handing the problem back to the person(s) whose problem it really is (Step 3) or from handling the problem on your own. Consider the following: <br>  <br>  a .    What fears are blocking me at this moment from taking the steps I need to resolve this problem? <br>  <br>  b .   What are the irrational beliefs behind these fears? <br>  <br>  c .    Refute the irrational beliefs using the steps given in the ``Handling Irrational Beliefs'' section two in Tools for Personal Growth. <br>  <br>  d .   Initiate a program of self-affirmation as presented in the "Self-Affirmations'' section 3 in Tools for Personal Growth.. <br>  <br>  e .    Use an imagery scenario with ``guilt'' as an object you packaged in a nice box. It is brought to a mountain top and thrown off a cliff for good. <br>  <br>  f .    Affirm for yourself that: <br>  <br>  You deserve to solve this problem.  <br>  <br>  You deserve to be good to yourself <br>  <br>  You deserve to have others be good to you, too! <br>  <br>  Step 5:   If your guilt is not resolved after completing Steps 3 and/or 4, return to Step 1 and begin again.|`|Px9APa5Zaa	La dépression et la mort !|`|c6fa1c4de463bceb900413926d3b00c4aa	On se sent coupable.|`|e07b783a35f7bada2b751e2077f1b0e6aa	devenir la victime de soi-même|`|v3xApmREaa	La culpabilité n'est pas une émotion en soi.

juhim6Bhaa	Being a sociopath doesn't go away. It's likely that some of the "act" you see is stuff she learned at the mental health place. She's probably busy reminding herself not to react in inappropraite ways. There's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  She's not ever going to be normal, but she must see value in you as a person if she keeps you around. It's good she likes some people and kids.

Every animal in the animal kingdom has the ability to love and there's proof of it (the release of the hormone oxytocin). Love also comes from the same part of the brain as any other emotion. So, if she can feel anger, pain and anything else, she can most definitely feel love.<br>  <br>  Besides that, I think you're right when you say she would be devastated if she lost you as a friend and it will make her worse off (which will only make her more mentally unstable). I've found the best thing you can do in this lifetime is appreciate the good in people and positively effect as many people as you can. She became the way she was out of training and being around negativity so it only makes sense for being around positive people to have a positive impact on her. Just don't take on so much of her problems to the point you over extend yourself. The best thing for everyone (your self included) is to be as understanding as possible to whoever you meet. It's easy to brush people off and categorize people as "good" or "bad", but this is a false way of looking at people and truly understanding humanity. <br>  <br>  Additionally, you say she acts a lot. In that case, it's incredibly likely she lied about being a sociopath. She's probably a compulsive liar.

CciXZNYraa	You don't look bad or anything, but maybe you can lose a little weight, if you want...<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Besides being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, and Sprite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Do you drink enough water? Dehydration can cause headaches. Also if you feel tension in your neck then I would definitely suggest you go to a chiropractor, they actually help a lot with headaches. They actually relieve them instead of drugging you up so you don't know that you should be having a headache because something is out of alignment! Some regular family physicians will just give you pain killers, if they tell you it's a tension headache please see a chiropractor, you'll be amazed!|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Of course there could be something wrong with you, but it could be very minor.  It could be allergies causing sinus problems.  It could be tension from the economy or other things that you might be concerned about.  It could be that you need glasses.  It could be the air quality in your home.  It could be that your blood sugar is too low.  It could be that you need a chiropractor.  It could be squinting from bright sunlight.  There are far more minor causes than serious, major ones.  Just go and rule the major ones out.  Be sure to ask about blood sugar and eyesight while you are there as they frequently get overlooked by most GPs in the early stages and are easy to test for.<br>  <br>  Be sure to pay attention for any regular patterns in their appearance, like if you always wake up with them, or they appear when watching TV.
xRQAsGRAaa	Doing those exercises will build muscle- but it will be a slow and agonizing process.<br>  If you cannot get access to weights, there is no way to build muscle "fast". <br>  The only thing I can tell you is, start doing inclined pushups(put your feet up on your bed to add weight to your arms), and keep increasing the incline.<br>  This will work your chest and triceps.<br>  Since you can't get access to weights, go to walmart and buy resistance bands. They're about $15. This way you can work your biceps, lats, and back with heavy resistance. <br>  <br>  For your legs, fill up your bookbag with heavy objects, and do 10-8-6 squats(make sure to keep your back straight), and do lunges with this weight.<br>  For your shoulders, hold your heavy bookbag in one hand, and shrug your shoulders 4x6 times. Switch hands. <br>  <br>  This is all I can think of to help you build muscle at home with no equipment. Good luck.

Vuu00jqtaa	Thyroid problem is very common and it can cause irregular periods. There is a thyroid pill which will solve the problem. Ask your doc for it.<br>  Once you are on that pill, your periods will usually become regular. My best friend has the same problem. It is nothing to worry.
iEomLzhqaa	it might hurt if ur traps are really sore but there is no reason not to do squats. also, u should do both squats and leg press but squats are much more important.
qYZMWINKaa	Yes, this is healthy.|`|DtwqUqPTaa	hi..<br>  <br>  not only healthy it's SEXY
llez7aU4aa	So lets start with diet since that is 90% of it. First, replace all your snacks with raw fruits. Second, substitute one meal a day (probably dinner) with one of those protein shakes. If you don't want to buy the case of already made ones, then save some money and get some protein shake receipts online and do it yourself. Also, take your regular meal that you would normally, and then cut it in half. If you actually measure how much a serving is, you will be amazed at how small it is and how little we actually need to eat. <br>  <br>  For a work out, just keep it simple and do any workout type thing you want (run, bike, box, weights) but do it 2x a day for 30 min. Don't forget the weights. They will jump your metabolism for 39 hours.|`|tg1U67QGaa	try excercises or else u may join any martial arts class..it can burn ur overweight within 6 months...its true..|`|mNGTYTAaaa	Hey ...........  don't very you want loose your weight so try this pills <br>  <br>  enjoy ........................|`|Mt8x4BAjaa	The main thing you could do is watch the amount of what you eat during meals.  If the amount of food that's on your plate makes you not see your plate and you eat it all, then you're eating too much.  What you should do when eating at home, is just put half as much on your plate as normal, eat slower (cut your food all at once, put your fork down between bites, etc.)  While eating out, restaraunts put 3 times as much on your plate than what you should eat, so cut everything in half - and eat half, bring the rest home.<br>  <br>  As for exercising, start walking around your neighborhood, or somewhere you feel safe if you live in an unsafe area.  If you have a dog, this would be perfect for you and your dog, as it would benefit the both of you.  If you don't have a dog, maybe borrow a neighbor's dog.   Start out small with exercising - walk more and farther each time you go out.  The more you go walking, the stronger and faster you'll get, especially with a dog, and it will help with you blood pressure too.  Also you could do sit ups, push ups and just some basic things around the house.  As for weights, put some canned food into bags and use those as weights.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|TqkifveAaa	You can eat healthy food that  is not real expensive.  Oatmeal for breakfast is easy and inexpensive.  Try to eat fruit and vegetables as much as possible.  If you can afford to eat out, you can afford to by salad fixings. Drink lots of water, It is good for you. Brown bag your lunch. Try eating high fiber food also. Some other healthy inexpensive foods are: eggs, homemade soup and beans. bake a chicken and that can be used in alot of different ways, such as in sandwiches, soup, salad, tacos etc. lite popcorn is also a good snack. Portion control is very important. Also try not to snack after dinner. Hope this helps.|`|d3516c6efdb172714145901a8c4e7f13aa	Shame on your parents for not putting their money into places that really need it.  I always hate hearing the common complaint of "I have no money" and those are the very same people who are eating out every day and sometimes 2-3 times in a single day!<br>  <br>  If you're serious about weight loss, it's time to get serious about the reality of it.  There is no magic cure or a magic wand that is going to make it all better.<br>  <br>  Good diet? Your parents won't buy healthy food? You're 17 now...I think it might be time to get a part time job? I mean...you are serious, right?  Use that money wisely. Buy healthy food.  Splurge only once a week. <br>  <br>  Exercise routine? You don't need a fancy gym membership or a special workout routine.  Any exercise is beneficial to your health! Walk for 30 mins, ride your bike, rollerblade, etc. It doesn't have to be stiff and boring. It really can be fun.
5pQeDxT8aa	It sucks either way.<br>  In early pregnancy severe cramping can be bad for the mother and baby because it often can result in miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.<br>  <br>  In later stages its usually braxton hicks, ligaments stretching, or early labor

W5AWUOm0aa	Because she is detoxing her body, it is getting rid of the things left over. Sugar is the hardest thing to get out your system. The cleanse is removing it thats all. as long as she is being healthy about it she should be okay. If she is still concerned she should speak to a profesional about it. try a herbalist or natural food store, they would probaly be alot more helpful.|`|T64zP6fgaa	'wild rose' is your first clue... our poop smells like what we eat after it is processed in the stomach and intestines....
PAvYZJK2aa	i would say it is just curious|`|AA11785060	Pretty much normal and natural for well adjusted guys confident with their own sexuality.    Not sure why guys would watch porn together anyway if they didn't intend to get sexually stimulated by it. Loads of guys masturbate together but most will deny it ever happened.|`|MgMsMExPaa	No it is not gay , you are not touching them. Look up homosexual in a dictionary it is two people of the same sex engaged in a sexual act. When you jack your buddie that is gay ( engaged is the key word here)|`|D2qjMf3waa	No it is not gay, its just being comfortable with your friends who you trust.  All guys do it, some do it together.  We used to have contests to see who could shoot the furthest or most.|`|y51xYPGIaa	Its not gay. It's just having fun.|`|6NXJNOjJaa	um. yes thats weird|`|HpiKTxA3aa	i agree with charlie! your lucky to have friends that are comfortable enough to do that. be happy, its not gay!even if they give you a hand job its not gay if your comfortable with yourself.|`|KQbumEudaa	no...I do it with my buddys all the time... I get turned on by other people getting turned on. its gay if you really wanna "play" with your friends.|`|XHWyXCcjaa	what kind of porn are you watching?<br>  a wise man once said: "its only gay if you're the one taking it in the butt."

EcCbforQaa	Oh get a grip. Don't you know that if you are average, half the guys are bigger than you? If you're going to whine about what you hear chose the subject more carefully. Now, learn how to make love to her without relying on the size of your dick to make her eyes roll back.|`|AA11785060	So why would you marry someone as insensitive as this?  Sounds like it really bothers you, so get out of the marriage. No woman should compare her boyfriend's equipment to previous guys. Sure she will mentally, but no prudent or polite girl would tell the current guy how he measures up. Of course some idiot guys insist that the girl does give her comparison.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	You are too obsessed with penis size.<br>  <br>  Seriously. Are you really gay? Why do you care so much whose penis is the biggest among all the people who schtupped your wife?<br>  <br>  And if yours isn't the biggest, so what? You can't control that, and she is now married to you, so you won. Even with a smaller penis you won.<br>  <br>  Get over it.|`|az0KD0POaa	That's her way of saying your penis is boring. learn to make her scream. you can do it.<br>  <br>  She has a big hole!|`|1NWjta2jaa	I don't care about your penis, but I worry about the size of your brain...|`|VIM4XmYNaa	No offense, but she sounds kinda mean|`|XJWMfzfFaa	Tell your wife that her first time she feels big because it was her first time and it is tight in there and she feels big. Tell her urs is the same with theirs and it is just that she feel smaller when she with u because it was already stretched down there and feels small. By the way, big or small, you still need them to make babies.|`|amkvqb87aa	maan you care WAY too much about penis size. You saving her from other guys and being special has nothing to do with the size of your dick, im sorry but it really doesnt. Your wife does sound a bit cruel but it kinda sounds like your overexaggerating a bit. just talk to her about it|`|651e1ee6ad591c873f721e0ec3f034b2aa	Could be just a bit bitchy... but on the other hand perhaps she is tired of you being a bit stupid and shallow.  Perhaps you are so busy with your size that you forget to notice how you should be using it and what she likes. She probably wanted to punish you a bit and the question is if you deserved a bit of punishment.|`|UbgOjX7gaa	Dude man up and by and extendor 3000 or something. Nah for real if you have to ask, its your own insacurity, so stop asking her and realize you arent the biggest and probly not the smallest. take it for what it is and be a beast in the bed.|`|Vm9MqosNaa	And your question is...?|`|uNgw08cuaa	Wow, your wife is a BlTCH! Can you say divorce papers?|`|HpiKTxA3aa	damn dick slap her!
6JEhoZ08aa	Cherries have remarkable gout-reducing properties. And they cant be that bad for diabetics.|`|j6dAbXCAaa	A big thing for the gout is to drink lots of water, 1 oz for every 2 lbs of body weight.

0jLj7yJpaa	I was a 32A until junior year when I became a 32B. Breasts take longer to develop than some would think. Although you just got your first period, it may take a few more years for them to develop into their full size. It is never fun to be teased for having small breasts (it happened to me often during school) but smaller breasts are better in the long-run. You have fewer back problems, don't need to wear a bra all the time, and  you can feel comfortable that boys don't only like you for your breasts. Girls are teasing you because they feel uncomfortable having developed earlier and being treated like sexual objects before they truly want to be. The best thing for you to do is feel comfortable in your own skin, if you can. You are actually lucky compared to those girls. Your breasts will develop at a time when you feel more comfortable with male attention. If you are still uncomfortable, a padded bra is always an option, but make sure to buy a believable one and don't pad it yourself. You can get through it, I promise.|`|D4Cj8NiKaa	everyone develops at different times. maybe you are just a little slow. because so am i. i know exactly how you feel.<br>  but you just have to be patient. wait. you will eventually grow. trust me. some people just are slower..<br>  k hope i helped (:|`|jRHRjN5Iaa	Why no pills or cream? They can help you. Especially herbal cream. Just try it. It won't give you any side effect cos it contains natural ingredients you know. It's good.<br>  <br>  :)|`|sfzZZolSaa	Trust me u dont want big boobs.  It is so not fun!|`|3arJsZ91aa	First, do you have any older sisters?  Second, does your mother have a big bust?  If you come from a family where smaller breasts are the norm, then there is a good chance you will be the same.  I know from experience how hard it is to put up taunts and jibes.  My brother used to talk about my 'fried eggs' all the time.  As I have grown up, I realised that big breasts weren't the most important thing, in fact some boys are a bit scared of them (even though they pretend that they like them).  I am now at an age where most women's breasts are beginning to sag quite a bit (mine are still small and perky).  Small breasts do not make you any less of a woman.  I have grown to love mine and wouldn't change them for anything.  Ask your mum to take you to buy a pretty bra which makes the most of what you have got.  You might be lucky and find that in a few months time, you will get a growth spurt and get bigger.|`|muHctmaGaa	You're thinking about your body way too much, the so-called Adolescent Audience Syndrome. Your classmates should mature by high school and leave you alone, when breasts are no longer novel. Everyone's body is different, that's all you will hear. Maybe your breasts will never grow, maybe you'll be a D by graduation, maybe yours won't grow until a dose of hormones from birth control pills or steady weight gain. It's too early to tell.|`|cCXGEZxaaa	Lots of Green M&Ms....or so the girls at church camp once told me. Can't say it helped much. Truth is it's all up to genetics. I was a 34A until my senior year of high school, now I realize 34B is hardly huge but it made me feel like I had real boobs (my sister has double Ds). You're still growing even though you've gotten your period, I got mine when I was eleven my boobs grew threw my 18th birthday. Don't worry about it too much. Be chill and let the comments roll off and always remember, if you don't have boobs when you're old they can't sag!|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover below - some food supplements and special exercise|`|N1ay8hzFaa	All you can do is gain weight.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	i have d's and im 14<br>  <br>  it sucks cause i cant really wear tank tops or anything without my crack just hanging.
