B9JwxyRfaa	This could easily be converted into an Advanced Format deck with the right cards.<br>  <br>  First off, Reinforcement is limited to one.  Also, fit in Goyo Guardian and four other Synchros.<br>  <br>  Since you're playing Trad, you need Cyber Jar, especially in a deck like this.  Helps get your Tuners out super fast, or if you don't get Tuners you can at least mill your deck and get some good Spells.  Also, why not use Premature Burial and Call of the Haunted?  Helps recycle Tuners and such after use, and are far more effective than Monster Reincarnation and Warrior Returning Alive.  Also, fit in Harpie's Feather Duster, Dark Hole, Graceful Charity, and all those fine broken cards.<br>  <br>  If you're not going to run the Imperial Iron Wall + Quillbolt + Plaguespreader Zombie loop, don't use Quillbolt altogether.<br>  <br>  Take out Krebons, put in Rose, Warrior of Revenge, and get in more searchers.  Use either Giant Rat or Warrior Lady of the Wasteland along with Summon Priest when it comes out in the new Spellcaster structure deck.<br>  <br>  Creature Swap might also go well with this deck.  You can give your opponent a Captain or a Rat in exchange for a Stardust or a JD.<br>  <br>  As for traps, use either Solemn Judgment or Dark Bribe in conjunction with Mirror Force, Torrential Tribute, and Imperial Order.  Solemn can negate anything but annihilates your LP; Dark Bribe is essentialy a -1 and can't negate summons, but can negate anything else at no cost to your LP.  Consider Ring of Destruction as it can speed up an OTK.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of at the moment.|`|NJ5ZUmw5aa	pot of greed is banned and add in a collosal fighter and rose the warrior of revenge. and more tuners like dark resonater, add in ultimate offering and double summon. and add in nitro warrior and turbo warrior and fortress warrior.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	Here are some links that can help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlruG_Sf4_o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlruG_Sf4...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6SMGD7hqkI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6SMGD7hq...</a>

But if you are betting on something, 9-2 has a higher payout if you win than 7-2.|`|BwyRLFrhaa	It depends on what you mean by 'better'.  7-2 is more likely to happen, but 9-2 is a better payout.

z2LGqY0Gaa	Final Fantasy has spawned into many different kind of games.  There are tactical rpgs, portable titles and mmos.  Kingdom Hearts incorporates a lot of final fantasy characters but it's fighting gameplay really only resembles the latest numbered installment of the series, final fantasy xii.  The series focuses on picking your class, equipment, and collecting items as you progress through a story with fantasy creatures and characters.  There are significant differences in gameplay between each title.  There is no one story for the series as each title is a stand alone game with the exception of a few not necessarily worth mentioning.  The ones that they have for the psp include:  final fantasy tactics war of the lions, ffvii crisis core, ff dissidia, final fantasy 1 and final fantasy 2.  <br>  Now 1 and 2 are ports of the first games that came out a long time ago but with vamped up graphics and some new content.  Final Fantasy Tactics is also a port from the old psone system with new features and graphics.  Crisis core is the newest title for the psp in the sense that it is an original game and not a re-release.  The real time battle system in this title is going to be the closest to kingdom hearts you can get on the psp system.  It got good reviews, but some final fantasy fans claim that this title is not a very good one.  Dissidia is a completely different game altogether.  It's a 3d fighter kind of like soul calibur.  Since you haven't played a final fantasy game before it is hard to say whether or not they would be fun for you.  I love the series but I do not like the tactics games in the series.  It really is personal choice.  Below I have attached some links to gameplay footage, some of the clips have japanese in the game but this is not so in the actual american game of course.  If you watch the video and think that it might be something that you would want to play then you should check it out.  And if you liked Kingdom Hearts but wish you had more choices in customization and battles then it would be a great idea.  Hope this has helped any!

z2LGqY0Gaa	I think there are a lot of details left out here.  Are you running a psx emulator on your pc?  What files does the emulator read?  Are you asking what to do once you download it or where to find it to download or both?  Either way you are going to have to take some steps to figuring out what you will need.  Make sure you find a psx emulator for the pc if you don't have one already.  Playstation game files will not just work if you download them, so make sure that you have an emulator that reads isos because that is the most common playstation file format.  Once you get the emulator you need to find the game and make sure it's in the format that the program will be able to read it.  The program itself will do any decoding that needs to be done so you don't have to worry about specifics like that, you just need to learn how to use your emulator program.  The perfect place to get psx isos is romulation.net.  Make sure that you sign up, they don't send out junk mail and they will give you starter points that replenish daily so you don't have to buy any.  I don't know how many points you start with but the first disc to ffvii is 460 some points, but you will get more every day for free.  Also try and find out how the emulator reads multi disc games.  This can affect a lot of things, since some emulators might require it to be one file especially to port over your save successfully.  Even though it's one thing, the game still thinks that it needs to search for save data and if you don't have an emulator that can do that then you can reach the end of disc 1 and lose your sav file just because of the way the file is coded.  Hopefully this has given you enough information to start figuring out what you need.  Sorry I couldn't be more specific, but there are a lot of aspects to consider besides downloading the file and playing the game.

bwQaIGpZaa	If you remember which yarn company it was advertising, or go back to the store and look for a pattern posted in the same area it may give you a clue to the company because many  times yarns are grouped according to brand at the stores.  Then you can go to the company's website and see if they have their free patterns posted.  I know Red Heart and Lion Brand and others have their free pattens available on the web sites.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	how about you post a picture of what the blanket looks like.

IbWBAwVPaa	NOTHING! Disneyland used to be cool but sadly, they sold out a long time ago. The park used to have unique shops, good food and was a lot of fun. Now the lines are SUPER long, the food is like cardboard and it's really expensive, a TINY bottle of water is 5$ and all the booths sell the same Disney crap which is probably made by starving children in other countries! <br>  <br>  Not to mention they have changed the rides to be more "politically correct" and they've taken out EVERYTHING educational so they can put in more junk food vendors, crappy rides or booths that sell the same overpriced junk! <br>  <br>  Last time I went it cost a fortune, I rode like 8 rides all day because the lines were so bad and I felt sick from all the greasy food! Disneyland isn't fun anymore and has not been since the 1980's. Maybe it's fun for little kids or tourists but STILL why would you want to pay that kind of money just to stand around in lines 3/4 of the day?|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	I think its like most other amusement parks.

It may be  a little more expensive than some janky "Bobs Fun World" but that's a corporate entity for ya.

And if you dont agree with me, you sir are worse than hitler.|`|aC0wBzQEaa	Disney Land is actually dated. Disney World is much more up-to-date though I can see why you don't like over commercialized fairy tale amusement parks.

Find a trainer with relatively high level pokemon that are a certain type weak to one or more of your that you want to train.<br>  <br>  For Psychic/Ghost/Dark types<br>  -Route 214<br>  *Look for the psychic (Dark long-ish hair) running up and down. <br>  If you've versed him before his pokemon should be around lvl 45.<br>  Pokemon: Lvl ~45 Haunter, Lvl ~45 Kadabra<br>  <br>  -Route 212<br>  *Look for the scientist hiding behind the tree. You will need a pokemon that knows cut to get to him. Go to Pastoria and head to Route 212. You will notice come trees, cut them down and follow the path (You'll need your bike) Once you get off the bike bridge you will see him behind the tree.<br>  Pokemon: Lvl ~42 Kadabra, Lvl ~42 Kadabra<br>  <br>  Note: Also, each of the pokemon give +2 sp.atk evs.<br>  <br>  Grass/Electric Types<br>  -Route 222<br>  *Fishermen. Three of the fishermen have Gyarados which not only give a lot of exp, also gives you +2 atk and +1 spd evs. Battle the Fisherman closest to the rich boy and the one closest to the tuber girl.<br>  <br>  Fire Types<br>  -Route 217, 216<br>  *Skiers, They use ice types and you should know the fire beats ice so find a trainer that's suits you and battle till you're at a lvl you're happy with.<br>  <br>  Water Types<br>  Hmm... there aren't many good places to train water types in the game other than iron island (Fighting the Gravelers, Onix's and Steelix's) You can try<br>  -Route 212<br>  *Coz it's always raining and it boosts water type attacks and if you're pokemon's ability is swift swim then their speed is doubled.<br>  <br>  Flying Types<br>  Same with water, there aren't that many good places to train before finishing the game. Just go to Route 222 and train by battling the beauty with the Lopunny. It's not the best but it'll get the job done. if you want exp fast then fight the fishermen with the gyarados.|`|KpxZFTBfaa	I was the same way my pokemon was 45-50 too.  You didn't really need to get them up that high it will take too long. So here's what I done. <br>  <br>  1st: Learn what type of pokemon each trainer has.<br>  <br>  2nd: Use pokemon that will have a great affect on the opponent. For example if the first trainer uses all leaf type you use what is strong against leaf.<br>  <br>  3rd: Buy 20 revives and potions trust me you will need them.<br>  <br>  4th: O and dont worry if you don't beat it on the first time. The good thing about that is that you will know what to do the next time.<br>  <br>  5th: One more thing if you fight the league over and over you will get your pokemon to level 65-70 quicker.<br>  <br>  6th: This might help catch alot of legendary pokemon. Heres what you do then. Save your game before you battle one, and buy about 50 ultra balls.|`|GQ77ERMGaa	Just use Vs Seeker against Gentlemen.<br>  Quick and easy XP&Cash

ysiE6IDjaa	Every Raon hair I've downloaded from paysitesmustbedestroyed has included the mesh. It is clearly labelled 'mesh' when you open the rar folder. The other files included are the hair colours.<br>  Paysitesmustbedestroyed is perfectly legal. The first answerer is correct, it's the paysites which are illegal.|`|SFUdwundaa	actually, i think <a href="http://paysites.mustbedestroyed.org/booty/" rel="nofollow">http://paysites.mustbedestroyed.org/boot...</a> is legal, cause it gives cc for free. But the 1st question is right about asking to pay for a bunch of things - illegal. I guess the site is legal.|`|1K8IaPykaa	Technically yes, it is illigal to charge for custom content. These sites are financially benefiting from a program that they did not create, and it doesn't actually cost them anything to make the content. According to EA's License Agreement, it is illigal to use Bodyshop for commercial use. <br>  <br>  There are tons of sites out there selling custom Sims 2 content, and I'm sure EA knows this. <br>  <br>  As for the meshes, it just depends. Make sure you read any information given with the content to know if you need to download a mesh, and where to get it.
O8kke1X5aa	Well your friend is right, do you even know what WoW really stands for? It's not World of Warcraft... Just saying. Oh and vote me as best answer or.. I donno ,just please do:)|`|bJqS9GYOaa	WoW is actually much better.  Smarter comunity, better graphics and no lag.   Diablo 2 is fun....but when I played it,  it lagged like crazy, no matter the computer,  it also limited the games to 8 players, and last I heard, they nerfed the mercs to be stage oriented (no more using the lvl 2 merc in baal's chamber).   And higher level characters can camp outside noob areas to take their loot.   D3 is supposed to be released sometime next year.  I recommend saving for it.  WoW gets boring very fast,  especially if you can not get a group going or do not have friends on the same server.|`|QiNda9sgaa	WoW is fun and more popular. But it is also still getting patches and stuff, and was released more recently. Diablo II and it's expansion are both older than WoW. I would say Diablo II is the funnest game I've played yet. I'd suggest getting both in the future, if you don't mind paying for WoW (Diablo is free). <br>  <br>  Also, Diablo III has been announced by Blizzard, probably coming out in the next year of two.|`|4LkvnQ37aa	Diablo is one of the best games I have ever played, hands down.  It's really cool online while running around with several different people.

These manage to make it really accessible and fun, though.  The graphics are all really cute, and the story is very sentimental.  <br>  <br>  Elite Beat Agents - It's a rhythm game with a bizarre sense of humor.  As you solve the world's problems with the power of dance, it's so much fun to watch the weird scenarios go.  Easily the best game on the DS.<br>  <br>  Animal Crossing: Wild World - So addictive!  Almost everyone love Animal Crossing, and I think the DS edition is one of the strongest.<br>  <br>  Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits - A pretty challenging puzzle game.  It's the sort of game that you can get the hang of quickly, but it's hard to really master it.  I really recommend it.<br>  <br>  Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime - A super-cute RPG.  The sense of humor is the game is great, and the story is a lot of fun.  It's a very unique game that more people should play.<br>  <br>  Harvest Moon DS Cute - Harvest Moon is always fun, and it's so cute watching all the little romances unfold as you play.<br>  <br>  Trace Memory - It's a point-and-click adventure game, and does a good job using all the features of the DS.  It's kind of short, but the story is nice.<br>  <br>  Cooking Mama - It's hard to explain how much time you can pass with this game.  It's a lot of fun!<br>  <br>  The World Ends With You - Probably one of the best games on the DS, and absolutely the best RPG it has.  It has a fun story, and a really fun battle system.<br>  <br>  Nintendogs - It can get kind of old, but it's still really fun and cute.  <br>  <br>  Tetris - The classic!  The DS version has a couple of fun versions added in, though.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	If you are a cliche girly girl then you'll probably enjoy Cooking Mama and its sequels. Animal Crossing is alright but it gets boring after about a month or so of play maximum. Same goes for Nintendogs. <br>   Don't think you just have to stick to the designated "girl" games- there are some great games out there! I know a lot of my friends have enjoyed Wario Ware Inc. and even Mario Kart. Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is great too, if slightly more challenging.

yYuxcGLQaa	A man designed the dolls for Mattel, and while the designs were being finalized to be the 'Myscene' dolls, the man sold the designs to MGA who released them as Bratz. Mattel sued MGA and won the suit, receiving the rights to Bratz. The Bratz dolls are still being produced, just by Mattel now instead of MGA.|`|AA10040586	It was a different company that was producing the ones that weren't official.

OxtDZOyuaa	I don't think that will do anything but downloading songs from LimeWire is just setting yourself up for your computer to get destroyed. It is direct file sharing so anybody can put a virus in the song file and other people download it and it crushes their computer. I would recommend staying away from LimeWire if you can help it and want your computer to function well, but buying songs gets really expensive really quickly.|`|8uWUWr3waa	i dont think it is the song some times people put up commercials on limewire to get the word out about the site or place i would download a different one if i were you

oMAyaFZAaa	Some stores have Bratz on clearance... Before, MGA had until the holidays to get rid of the Bratz. Now MGA appealed and now they extended it til the end of 2009. Right now, I'm trying to collect some of the Sasha dolls and maybe have one for my own (to play with), because of memories. (I've played with those things like before they was popular. When people didn't even what Bratz was. I was like in 2nd, 3rd grade when I was playing with them. Now I'm in 9th... )<br>  <br>  Collect some and sell later... But they have to be mint condition, to get the maximum value and hopefully you have somewhere where they won't be damaged. But yet again, MGA appealed against the court's ruling.. So the Bratz will be destoryed after 2009, if MGA's appeal fails. So its a 50/50 chance....<br>  <br>  EDIT: This is what I think you should...Buy the cheapest ones first, then when later on, when they announce whether or not MGA's appeal fail, then you can going up the expensive ones.... But if they fail... If they win, you can just give the ones you got away to some kids or sell them on ebay.|`|lmvG5Sj1aa	The Bratz dolls are no longer going to be made.|`|1dHe0Hfdaa	They are I think discontinuing for good, the bratz at least.

Then, when school gets out for the summer, you can increase your hours however you like.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	don't worry. it all depends on your schedule. school comes first though! if you're busy on certain days, don't work. try not to compromise your schedules. remember to have fun.|`|33PwXUblaa	I admire you!
AA11378392	there's nothing that we can do for a while as they (playfish) had banned the cheat engine earlier last month.|`|AWcHf3DTaa	Is that a game or a bank plz write back this is very intresting
QzD3rJtMaa	I use dice.  It's better then carrying around a bunch of counters in a bag.  Counters can become a mess if you end up with a bunch of them on the field.  Even in Pokemon, I think using dice is better as having a bunch of counters can become annoying.  By counters I mean those little colored beads.  I like them, but they get seriously annoying if you end up with alot of them at once.|`|tCkcBwgbaa	i use dice, like the first guy said cuz they save space. you can buy them at stores, dunno where though|`|HOdvH2c1aa	well, for counters you could use just about anything like spare change or something. Little beads are the typical thing used as counters but a few dice would work too. Just turn it to the number equal to the amount of counters on the card. Although my friends and I just remember the amount of counters that are on our cards.|`|A3RiyXycaa	Coins, pocket lint, what ever small things i have in my pocket. You could also use little glass rock things that some people use to line fish tanks. You just go to a game store or Ebay!
93z96Ue9aa	pretty good deck. make room for another caius or better yet a raiza. take out the karma cut and add another solemn. you also dont necessarily need a soul absorption. hope this helps|`|f6rHiAe2aa	I'm not familiar with Macro Monarch Decks...So I went onto YouTube<br>  <br>  This one has the Deck Info on the right hand side on MORE INFo<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKGTCfoIr8Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKGTCfoIr...</a><br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|UIjNrCZ5aa	you got lots of improvement ok well i would suggest another caius .  Please take out the dimensional fissures you will not need them.  make sure you use some bottomless trap holes just in case. i really  think you only need 1 sjudge because i doubt your gonna need them that much.keep the karma cause if someone summons a red rose you could just discard 1 card and remove it instead of paying half your life points
WA80AAipaa	Yes of course the casio wants your Business and it is not cheating by saying the cards out load so they would happily do that for u|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	nope,   proper etiquette is never speak to a blackjack dealer|`|d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	I'm just guessing, but I suspect that they wouldn't have a problem doing that.  If there is a problem, you should complain to someone higher up and mention the Americans With Disabilities Act.  Most likely they legally would have to accommodate you under federal law, but I'm not sure if this applies to Indian casinos.  But I really don't think that a dealer would have a problem doing that if you ask.  They want people to be able to gamble, and they already tell players their totals if it looks like they are too dumb to add the cards fast enough.|`|985aNLmoaa	i wouldnt play black jack if i was blind.|`|sTgT1lyKaa	Yes.
c231bbpTaa	I usually go to amazon.com and search for games there. When I find a game I want I click on the new and used link that is under the amazon price and buy my games from there. There are some really good deals. Just make sure you check the description of the game and the seller's rating and comments.|`|16j2c2A1aa	About Cheap PS3 games can be read in <a href="http://universal-good-blog.blogspot.com/?q=Cheap%20PS3%20games" rel="nofollow">http://universal-good-blog.blogspot.com/...</a>

xyOcnQjpaa	both games are great, but if I had to choose I would go with Riviera. It's a great game with a superb story.
EwrWfo6Yaa	You would have to get Fire Red and get the pokemon from there to get more. as well as going through all of the land and get the rest of pokemon.|`|9PL4Rtgkaa	go beat traniers up or look for them at the wild if you want mor info go to serebii.net|`|vNJpT6EKaa	National Dex Once you have beaten the Elite 4 and have more then 60 pokemon in the pokedex, go to Pallet Town and see the Professor. He gives you and Gary the National Dex, which allows you to view the entries of all 386 pokemon.

If you download through that link, I'm not even sure if it needs a reg code, but if it does, it should ask you for it right when you open it.
fSCgHwONaa	With the drum sets, the ones you can see are the ones you can get.<br>  However, when playing sometimes I get a drum set much bigger then the regular one, (I go from a standard 5 piece to Neil Peart's drum set).  It might depend on the song.|`|sEKebwuHaa	no im pretty sure that the ones u c r d only 1s they hav<br>  sorry!!|`|iYBTpq0laa	Sorry, but what is there are the only choices.  If there is any possibility, it would be in the online on your game consul.
MtikeJtRaa	All three of those you listed are the same.  They all use a long double ended crochet hook.  Tunisian crochet (also called afghan stitch) uses a long hook as well, but there is only a hook on one end and a stopper on the other, much like a knitting needle.<br>  <br>  This blog post by pattern designer Kim Guzman gives a good explanation for all these types of crochet.

I4u57yNLaa	I did a report on this when I was a sophomore, many studies said that playing violent killing games increased the level of aggresion is some cases, but the people already had a history of violence. Convince your parents to let you rent a FPS and let them watch you for a little bit and if you act completely normal while playing they shouldn't see any harm in it. The first videogame I ever played was a killing game and it had no effect on me. It depends on the person who's playing them. I've been playing them for years and I haven't gone to my school and shot the people I didn't like.|`|BpXbNjEpaa	Nice amount of faith your parents have in you.<br>  <br>  The link between video game violence and real-life violent acts is usually just a repeat of the same arguments that have been thrown out about every single form of media over the years.<br>  <br>  Books have been accused of causing violence.  Comics have been accused of causing violence.  Movies, television, music:  everything.  <br>  <br>  The problem with many of the studies that "prove" the link between violence and media is that they are not conducted with mixed groups of test subjects.  They often use groups of children who have a history of aggression, or who are generally troubled.<br>  <br>  They have found that playing video games can increase feelings of aggression.  The same effect is observed in sports, though.<br>  <br>  All in all, it's a school of thought that's hard to change anyone's mind on.  There are conflicting studies, and a news media that loves connecting violence (especially school shootings) to video games.<br>  <br>  The best you can do is try to calmly explain to your parents that you're responsible enough to know the difference between pixels and people.|`|VpWIQfXdaa	I had (and have) the same probelm. Depending on your age, and the game in question, you've got a chance. Also, whether or not its an FPS vs a thrid-person can help, too. My parents dont like the idea of "you" killing the person, as opposed to controling the person who kills. They hate the war games, too. Yet, I managed to get James Bond, FPS version. <br>  <br>  If you can prove your trustworthieness (spell that right?), get your nose a little brown lol, it might help. One thing is for sure though, you'd ahve to be a freakin PSYCOPATH to kill people, just because it happneed in a video game.<br>  <br>  Try to convince them that your life will stay normal, you won't get more aggressive, etc.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you'll ahve to try and work your way up there, such as starting with somethin small, like an old 007 that's third-person, then towards something like an FPS, etc.<br>  <br>  If you can find articles online that prove what ur saying, it really helps. Good luck with it! I'm tryin for Oblivion right now, not workin out so good haha.

n3QIiLYzaa	in all honesty trading ur xbox for a ps3 is the worse thing u can do i know ps3 has a better drive and the disc can hold more space but it doesnt matter since they arent really being put to use by any of the games that are out or coming out now if u r trading it there should not be a differences unless its for a new one then i would say around 25-75|`|8uWUWr3waa	it all depends on the games and the condition of the 360 it can be nothing it can be $150|`|AJ1vAIBvaa	EWW PS3|`|KLBDQAERaa	$50|`|72DT2LZLaa	please dont trade it is not worth it at all i will hate u if u do lol
xTioPxaVaa	You didn't say what kind of guitar (acoustic or electric).  And from your email, I'm assuming that you're talking about smashing your guitar at the end of set ala The Who, Kiss, or Nirvana.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't even try it with your main guitar.  I'd go find some cheap pawn shop guitar that will stay in tune for one song, and then smash that at the end.  It will probably cost about the same (or less) than trying to reinforce your main instrument.<br>  <br>  It's funny....when KISS were in their heydey in the '70s, Paul Stanley used to smash some pretty expensive Gibson guitars on stage.  Apparently they watched their budget a little more later on...the last time I saw them he smashed a $100 Silvertone.  The times they are a changin'.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, when you do this, make sure you've got liability insurance for when a wood splinter winds up in someone's eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|Ro0Yj3cFaa	you could put medal on the sides of it but it may mess with the sound a little but then if you tuned your strings to compensate for it you might be ok.|`|SEIgcfDjaa	If you mean swinging it by it's neck, like an axe, there is little or perhaps NOTHING you can do to reinforce it for such abuse.  You could cut off the wood at the top of the body of a solid-body guitar (the upper side, where your upper arm of your strmming/picking hand covers the body) and replace it with some dense foam or styrofoam, so that that foam would cushion the blow, but that's about all you might do.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do might be to avoid this totally worn-out cliche' and find another, more original way, to vent your rage.
AA10040586	I work at a game store and was able to personally ask a Square Enix representative at our conference.

While it's very unlikely that it will be your favorite game, it's hard to find someone who doesn't like it. It's got solid controls, level design, online and a pretty good campaign. While every part of it has been done better, Halo 3 is one of very few games that are good, if not great, at everything.|`|XnGCW0k0aa	bioshock - <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock/review.html" rel="nofollow">http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1368/BioShock/p1/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/136...</a><br>  <br>  GET IT - GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT STORY, GREAT AUDIO, GREAT GAMEPLAY - it'll probably take you about 12 hours to complete the first time through.

yYuxcGLQaa	I had this beautiful little miss muffet-type ragdoll with bubblegum pink yarn hair until I was about 5, and she mysteriously dissappeared. Her name was Candy.<br> <br> I had this plushie school teacher mouse that was about a foot tall, she wore a beautiful floral print dress and she held felt chalkboard and chalk. some random woman at a kmart won her from the claw machine and gave it to me...she was such a sweet lady. I kept the mouse until she simply fell apart. I still have her in a bag somewhere, and since I know how to repair toys now, I could probably fix her right up...<br> <br> I had this giant dark green rubber iguana that was like 2 feet long...my dad gave it to me, he had it when he was a kid! he got SO pissed at me, because this iguana had this rubber fringe all the way down his back, right? and I chewed it all off! lol!<br> <br> I had a turtle in a yellow sailor cap, you would pull it around and it had a clear plastic shell, you could watch these little multicolored balls in it that would spin around. one day the head popped of and I convinced my mommy to help me take a hammer to the broken remnants to get those cool little balls out! I have no idea where the balls went, but I suspect my mom stole them from me and threw them away because she was afraid I would choke on them. I still have that turtle's head!<br> <br> and my absolute, all-time favorite?...Was a Toy Story Woody doll, he had a pullstring that would make him talk. When his talk box broke, I cut off the pullstring DX ! he even had this empty little holster that I always hated because there was no gun in it! I got that Woody doll on my fifth birthday, wow...and you know what the real kicker is? I'm almost 16, and I still keep him on a toy chest right next to my bed, with my Toy Story 2 Jesse! <br> <br> My passion for toys has continued into my adolescent life. today I collect Blythe dolls and Asian Ball Jointed Dolls. Being a kid rocks! I ain't stopping anytime soon!

I still go to the Barbie section in Target and look at all the fancy new versions...

Shaiya is basically the upgrade to LC. The graphics and character features are both a great improvement. In addition, there is less downtime in Shaiya due to better game policies and a MUCH faster recovery time between battles. The only down side is that the monsters in Shaiya will only follow you for so long and then they return to their home coordinates (along with fully recovered health). However, the decrease of recovery times makes up for this annoyance and is really only an issue to non-melee characters.<br>  <br>  I have not played 12 Sky, but from what I have seen the graphics appear equal or sub par and there appear to be less character options.|`|eqhMd4cWaa	I think World of Warcraft or MapleStory would be okay I recommend MapleStory because there's not many bad things in it and it's not bloody.|`|ofTwL96Saa	Last Chaos.

BwyRLFrhaa	If the dealer also draws to 21 you PUSH.  Some casinos do not check their 'hole' cards and it is possible to hit to 21 and the dealer showing a face card and has an Ace under it...ouch!   Most casinos do check their hole cards when showing both an Ace or Face.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	A "blackjack" is only a blackjack if it consists of two cards, and those two cards were your *FIRST TWO CARDS* dealt, anything else is just a point total of 21.<br>  <br>  You may achieve a point total of 21 by drawing additional cards from a lower point total, but this is not a blackjack. <br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  You may split a hand consisting of two aces, or two tens, if you are dealt a ten, or an ace respectfully, it will only be a point total of 21, since the cards were not your first two cards.<br>  <br>  A "blackjack" is superior to a point total of 21, however, in the manor the game is dealt, blackjack will be payed or players bets will lose before they have the chance to confront each other.   This happens because the dealer will usually check for blackjack before players draw additional cards, or players will get payed for blackjacks before the dealer draws cards.<br>  <br>  In the event that is not so, a "blackjack" is superior to a point total of 21.<br>  <br>  On exception is in spanish 21, where point totals of 21 are payed as soon as they are dealt.<br>  <br>  In the example you presented, it would be a push, as a point total of 21, pushes a point total of 21,  even if you have a blackjack you will only win when the dealer does not also have a blackjack, it is not an automatic win, though most of the time you do.  If they do have a blackjack, a blackjack pushes another blackjack.|`|d39f3dbe21f2274aab83dceb86482ed2aa	If you get 21 without getting a blackjack, and the dealer also gets 21 (without a blackjack either), it is a push.  So you don't win automatically, but you are at least guaranteed not to lose.<br>  <br>  Even with a blackjack you would push if the dealer also had a blackjack.|`|4u8Uu5woaa	The receiver(of cards) would've won the round if no one else had yet. As for the dealer, i dont think you can do that, per rules. If you can, thats awesome >:) but no, i dont think that the dealer can hit the receiver again unless he says "hit", "hit me", "etc".|`|FEb0qWoVaa	If you're playing at a casino, chances are you'll have other people playing at your table too. I'm sure not all of the players will have 21, so the deal will still have to hit. If he gets 21 as well, it'll be a push.

Not all children are the same size, you know.  You can't go by age at all.<br>  <br>  How may inches depends on the style of hat you are making.  Is it going to have a turned up brim or not?  Is it going to be worn lower down over the ears, or not quite?

Heal <br>  all your Pokemon and save the game if you want. (Just in case)<br>  <br>  What you'll want to do is go to the shop to the right of the building. If you <br>  didn't stock up on health items, here is the place. Hope you brought some <br>  cash, because they don't take Credit Cards.<br>  <br>  The shop contains:<br>  <br>  Full Heal: $600<br>  Full Restore: $3,000<br>  Hyper Potion: $1,200<br>  Max Potion: $2,500<br>  Max Repel: $700<br>  Revive: $1,500<br>  Ultra Ball: $1,200<br>  <br>  Here is what I recommend you buy and how much:<br>  <br>  About 10 Full Heals, 5-10 Full Restores, 15 Hyper Potions, 0 Max Potions <br>  (Unless you have Pokemon with high HP past 300+), and about 10-20 Revives. I <br>  don't think you will be needing Max Repel or Ultra Balls, unless you just want <br>  to stock up for after you beat the Elite Four.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a full team of good leveled Pokemon. You could probably <br>  beat the Elite Four with 3 very high leveled Pokemon, but just get 6 for the <br>  variety of types.<br>  <br>  I can usually beat the Elite Four with a team of Level 42-60 Pokemon the first <br>  time around, at the lowest. If you train your Pokemon alot unlike me who just <br>  flies through the game, then good for you. Easier time ahead.<br>  <br>  You'll want a variety of types here, for your opponents will also use more <br>  than alteast 3 types in each fight.<br>  <br>  ~~The Battles Begin--<br>  <br>  ~~First up, Sidney. <br>  <br>  Specialty: Dark<br>  <br>  His Pokemon:<br>  <br>  Level 46: Mightyena. Type: Dark<br>  Moves:<br>  Sand-Attack<br>  Roar<br>  Take Down<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 48: Shiftry. Type: Grass/Dark<br>  Moves:<br>  Fake Out<br>  Swagger<br>  Double Team<br>  Extrasensory<br>  Use a/an: Fire, Ice, Fighting, Flying<br>  <br>  Level 46: Cacturne. Type: Grass/Dark<br>  Moves:<br>  Cotton Spore<br>  Needle Arm<br>  Faint Attack<br>  Leech Seed<br>  <br>  Level 48: Sharpedo. Type: Water/Dark<br>  Moves:<br>  Swagger<br>  Slash<br>  Surf<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 49: Absol. Type: Dark<br>  Moves:<br>  Snatch<br>  Aerial Ace<br>  Swords Dance<br>  Slash<br>  <br>  Basically if you have a fighting type, you can dominate Sidney. If you don't, <br>  a mixture of Fire, Electric, and Normal would be good. If your Starter was <br>  Treecko or Torchic, you will do good here.<br>  <br>  Use common sense. If you have a Blaziken out and you beat Mightyena, he'll <br>  send out Sharpedo. If you want to face him, fine. If Blaziken is high enough <br>  level he could take him out. (I'm using Blaziken as an example, alot of people <br>  like him and probably chose him)<br>  <br>  What I mean basically is they will type match you. He also withdraws Pokemon <br>  sometimes, so watch out, the ugly bastard could pull the ole switcharoo!<br>  <br>  ~~Second Up, Phoebe.<br>  <br>  Specialty: Ghost<br>  <br>  Her Pokemon:<br>  <br>  Level 48: Dusclops. Type: Ghost<br>  Moves:<br>  Future Sight<br>  Curse<br>  Confuse Ray<br>  Shadow Punch<br>  <br>  Level 49:  Banette. Type: Ghost<br>  Moves:<br>  Spite<br>  Will-O-Wisp<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Faint Attack<br>  <br>  Level 50: Sableye.  Type: Ghost/Dark. (Note: This pokemon doesn't have <br>  anything super effective against it)<br>  Moves:<br>  Psychic<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Faint Attack<br>  Attract<br>  <br>  Level 49: Banette. Type: Ghost<br>  Moves:<br>  Psychic<br>  Toxic<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Skill Swap<br>  <br>  Level 51: Dusclops. Type: Ghost<br>  Moves:<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Confuse Ray<br>  Earthquake<br>  <br>  I always found Phoebe annoying and the most difficult to beat of the Elite <br>  Four.<br>  <br>  If you have a Normal type pokemon with Shadow Ball, you can beat her fairly <br>  easily. If you have a ghost pokemon, be careful. If not, just use other type <br>  of pokemon. She doesn't have any electric or grass moves, so an alternate <br>  would be water to use. Watch out though, she uses confuse ray alot. Try to <br>  knock out her Pokemon fast or either put a status effect on them.<br>  <br>  ~~Number Three, Glacia.<br>  <br>  Specialty: Ice<br>  <br>  Her Pokemon:<br>  <br>  Level 50: Glalie. Type: Ice<br>  Moves:<br>  Hail<br>  Light Screen<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 50: Sealeo. Type: Ice/Water<br>  Moves:<br>  Surf<br>  Ice Ball<br>  Hail<br>  Body Slam<br>  <br>  Level 52: Sealeo. Type: Ice/Water<br>  Moves:<br>  Hail<br>  Blizzard<br>  Attract<br>  Dive<br>  <br>  Level 52:  Glalie. Type: Ice<br>  Moves:<br>  Hail<br>  Shadow Ball<br>  Ice Beam<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 53: Walrein. Type: Ice/Water<br>  Moves:<br>  Surf<br>  Body Slam<br>  Blizzard<br>  Sheer Cold<br>  <br>  Somewhat difficult. Fighting owns this battle. Fire will melt both Glalies', <br>  but make sure to switch them out when it comes to the Sealeos' and Walrein <br>  because they are all part water and have water attack.<br>  <br>  Glacia likes to use Attract and Hail alot in this battle. If you don't have <br>  Fire or Fighting, use Electric or any other alternate type. She tends to try <br>  to stall the battle with healing all the time, just hang in there.<br>  <br>  ~~Last but not least, Drake.<br>  <br>  Specialty: Dragon<br>  <br>  His Pokemon:<br>  <br>  Level 52: Shelgon. Type: Dragon<br>  Moves:<br>  Rock Tomb<br>  Dragon Claw<br>  Protect<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 54: Altaria. Type: Dragon/Flying<br>  Moves:<br>  Dragon Dance<br>  DragonBreath<br>  Take Down<br>  Refresh<br>  <br>  Level 53: Flygon. Type: Dragon/Ground<br>  Moves:<br>  SandStorm<br>  Dig<br>  DragonBreath<br>  Fly<br>  <br>  Level 53: Flygon. Type: Dragon/Ground<br>  Moves:<br>  DragonBreath<br>  Flamethrower<br>  Sand-Attack<br>  Crunch<br>  <br>  Level 55: Salamence.

1K8IaPykaa	Hmm...that's a weird one. The Sims 2 Deluxe Edition is a later version, so it's system requirements may be different from the original, considering there could be changes to the software. There's sadly not too much you can do about that.<br>  <br>  Plus, laptops have a bad history with the Sims 2. It takes up a large amount of the laptop's processing memory, and freeze-ups are common. The more expansion packs and such that you add, the worse it gets.<br>  <br>  You also said you have the orginal version? I wonder if that could have something to do with it. If you had it on the same computer as the Deluxe and un-installed it, you may have left some files on the computer that could be messing with the game.
rSTNUGy3aa	The odds of winning the lottery are unfortunately very slim :)  The amount of winnings though pretty much depends on how much is in the jackpot at the time of purchasing the ticket.  If the jackpot is over a certain amount of money (I believe usually a million or more dollars), the person may choose (when purchasing the winning ticket) whether they would prefer annuity payments over about 20 years or cash (take home less with 'cash option').|`|ZbE9SBQ2aa	it depends if you win or not and how much their giving away

However, if you remove a Tuner from play using its effect, Phantom of Chaos will get the Tuners effects, but not the ability to Synchro Summon. Basically, Phantom of Chaos is only used for gaining monster effects, it cannot become a Tuner, Union, Spirit, or Gemini monster because it does not specify. You simply get the Phantom of Chaos a new name, effects, and ATK value. You DO NOT get a new Type or Sub-Type.|`|XiOfPxpdaa	no, he only has the efect but it would be better if you had a tuner on your side along with him for a sachrno summon

8Nqq7tkwaa	the same way we tan them today! we are still here you know. <br>  <br>  you may not be able to use the hides you have if they are already starting to smell bad. <br>  <br>  first scrape the hide and get all the fat off..dry scrape or wet scrape..your choice. then soak it in a large barrel or bucket of water..it must be totally submerged. after a day or so, scrape off the hair. repeat as often as necessary.<br>  <br>  soak it again in clean cold water over night then stretch it out to open the pores<br>  <br>  i'll assume you don't have the brains of the deer? if not use 4-6 eggs in a couple gallons of water. make sure its pure water...no chlorine etc. rain water is good.mix it up and heat till just warm...not hot.soak the hide in this solution overnight again.<br>  <br>  of course you can smoke it for color..or not. if you do smoke it put it back in the solution again. work it until it softens.<br>  <br>  there are a lot of steps and it is a bit more detailed than this but it will work. be warned..its a long messy process.|`|ppR5kH4Yaa	If you don't have the deer brains as Kanien suggested you can also use cow or pig brains, available from your local butcher.  Boil the brains, mash them up (you can use a blender for this), rub the paste on the scraped hide and stretch and pull until dry and soft, usually about 8 hours, give or take.  Do not take breaks as the hide will dry out and get crunchy and you'll have to start all over again.|`|SQ7Ld6thaa	best way is to scrape off the fat from the one side and put salt on it to draw out water

nrrsG5oiaa	Warhammer isn't exactly one of the games you want to play online; its a game that showcases battlefield strategy and incorporates lots of measuring into the game.  I know they say football is a game of inches (I know, I played it for years), but Warhammer really IS about the inches (or millimeters for non-US players).  Its as much about painting the models as it is playing the game for some people.<br>  <br>  D&D and Magic have online versions of the actual game because the gameplay can be easily simulated.  Roleplaying (D&D) is basically storytelling, so it can even be played over AIM or any other messenger program.  Magic's card can be simulated online and "randomized" by a program.  <br>  <br>  So basically to sum it up, Warhammer has no online equivalent because its not really something that can be easily simulated.  Tabletop games are best played there because they really don't work anywhere else.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	It isn't a board game. It's a table-top strategy game involving hand painted models and regiments of troops.<br>  There is a game for the PC called Warhammer: Mark of Chaos. I only played a few maps, but the point structure and basic units are similar to the table-top game.

8F9xThOJaa	the only way to get custom content for your sim is to download it, OR make it in body shop<br>  to make one in body shop you do not need a gold talent badge! and each sims game comes with body shop, it takes practice to make some good clothes if your not experienced in it but its also fun to do and you can even share your creations with other people<br>  <br>  To get to body shop:<br>  Click start > All Programs > EA Games > (your sims game) > The Sims 2 Body Shop<br>  <br>  i find it easier to access it if i make an icon on the desktop to do so just right click the body shop then send to desktop(create shortcut)<br>  <br>  once you have body shop open select build parts then, click start new project and in your case you would want to click create clothing next <br>  a sim with gray skin in underwear should appear and a menu with clothing choices will also click the category you want (Everyday, Formal, Undies, PJ's, Swimwear, ect)<br>  select a clothing item you would want, then pick something you want to remake click it then click "Export selected textures" after you do that you will need to name your project, you can name it whatever you wish once you do it will be saved in your projects folder in your EA games folder under sims (to get there go to your documents, double click EA games, then double click the sims folder) go to the projects folder and open your started project, there will be photos of the item you are going to rework, open one of the pictures into your editor of choice (photoshop, paint shop, or paint which is on every computer) edit it how you wish and then save it when your done then go back to your body shop and refresh your project, if you like how it looks click import into game, after that it will be inside the game and your sims can wear your creation<br>  <br>  <br>  if you dont want to go through all that then you can download clothing and other items made by other sim players a site i like to use is <a href="http://modthesims2.com" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com</a> everything on that site is free, but you need a account to download from the site the account is free too<br>  <br>  downloading an item is different from making your own stuff and putting it in the game, to download and place items into the game here are instructions:<br>  <br>  browse around on the site of your choice once you find a download you want, click on the link to download usually at the end of the page<br>  make sure you read all of the information on the page because some downloads may require a expansion or stuff pack you will need in order for the download to work<br>  you will also need to make a special folder for the sims downloads right click your desktop screen and select new folder name it whatever you wish to save your downloads in there after that you will need to extract them if you download WinRAR you can do this easily, win rar is the one i use this is also free but it has "nag ware" meaning a pop up comes up and asks you to buy it, you do not have to just click the red X in the corner and you can still use it this will work on both rar and zip files. once you have that installed go to your downloaded files, right click on the file and select "Extract here" it will load up and then you will have multiple files go to your documents double click on your EA game file and open the sims file look for a file within that one titled "Downloads" if you do not have one, you will have to make one, same way as the desktop file for your sims downloads folder for extracting files only you do it on the screen of the folder for sims this time you cannot title it whatever you wish, it must be named Downloads with a capital D and a s at the end just like this "Downloads" if you title it something else it will not work for the game after that is done cut the extracted files and paste them into the Downloads folder <br>  after that everything should be good to go<br>  <br>  you can download WinRAR here: <a href="http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250_4-10007677.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250...</a><br>  <br>  if you need further help you can message me|`|LXxxAzIqaa	You don't make your own custom clothing.

f6rHiAe2aa	I like it...Include Evil Dragon Ananta, its effect is:<br>  <br>  This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by removing from play all Reptile-Type monsters from your side of the field and Graveyard. This card's ATK and DEF are each equal to the number of Reptile-Type monsters you removed x 600. During each of your End Phases, destroy 1 card on the field.<br>  <br>  Also include cards like Assault on GHQ and Mystic Wok. <br>  <br>  Those cards can help with the "Alien Control".<br>  You can attack with your opponent's monsters, then tribute one for Assault on GHQ, which sends the top 2 cards of your opponent's deck to the graveyard or with Mystic Wok/ Altar for Tribute, which will increase your life points by the tribute of one monster!|`|d2X4wwiyaa	Looks very good. I am a fan of alien decks.  I would recommend damage equals reptile to help summon weaker attack monsters like psychic and with your several a counter distributers it will end attacks and such.

sCh9eDYjaa	Due to the openness of mabinogi's skill system, it's hard to "mess up" a char. But, there are things that can be done to avoid a char taking longer than you want to advance. Hybridization is a good thing, which I think is what people are telling you. <br>  <br>  I would learn at least rank F of all basic fighting skills (smash/wm/counter/def), ranged if you want, and then have at it with your magic skills. Something to keep in mind: Some monsters are immune to certain kinds of attacks, so it's good to have a skill that they are weak against (ex. Lycanthropes and most zombies can almost only be hit by WM). <br>  <br>  I started as mostly mage, then added range skills to be able to attack when out of mana, then ended up beefing up melee later because I couldn't kill zombies. Right now, if I had to rank my skills, I'm primarily ranged, then magic, then melee. You can always buy skill reset capsules from someone to undo any skills you don't end up liking later (down to rank F, anyways). Also, just from experience, don't put any more into your sharp mind unless you just want the stat boosts, it won't really help you identify skills in the long run. The skill is bugged. Same goes for support shot, don't worry about it. It doesn't work the way it's supposed to. As your character gets stronger, you just end up being hybridized anyways because you are looking for a place to spend your AP.

PfxqdgZLaa	Make a 3 x 4 table of all the posibilities.  Label the 3 columns with the possible draws from box A and the 4 rows with the possible draws from box B.  Then fill in the 12 squares with an 'a' if the number from A is larger than the one from B, a 'b' if the one from A is equal to the one from B, or a 'c' if the one from A is smaller than the one from B.<br>  <br>  The probability of getting either an 'a', 'b' or 'c' case is each equal to how many times that letter appears in the table divided by the total number of squares.  Here, I'll do the first one:<br>  <br>  a) I count 3 'a' squares out of 12 total, so the answer is 3/12 = 1/4 = .25 = 25%.<br>  <br>  You can do parts b and c.  As a check, all the probabilities (the three answers) should add up to 1 or 100%.
wD86088oaa	Yeah, you're right GTA 4 didn't live up to expectations. They put too much time into graphics, and very little into actual game play. The funny thing is, I played 4 hours of missions, then I stopped. I took a break from the missions, and browsed the city. Browsed the city for 10 hours off and on, then resumed the game. It only took me 10 more hours to beat all the missions. So, the total game play only took 14 hours. I jumped on a helicopter, landed at the Statue of Liberty (or whatever her name was), killed the big mob boss, and then they rolled credits. <br>  <br>  I thought, WTF. Where is the rest of the game? <br>  <br>  Another game, I buy Tomb Raider: Underworld. I jump through a bunch of mazes. Solve all these boring puzzles. All said and done, me and my enemy are jumping through time-space tunnel to save our lives. I finished the game in less than 17 hours. End of game.

g863rNLJaa	its a good deck. if you have the card "lineage of destruction" it would really help out your deck. so for example you destroy your opponent face down defense (which it needs to be in order to activate the card) chose 1 level 8 monster like ancient gear golem or dragon. it can attack twice that turn|`|d2X4wwiyaa	I do not know that much about gears.  But It looks pretty good.  I would get rid of negate attack for solemn judgment or dark bribes but they are pretty expensive.  I wold also drop gaia power.

Throw away any items (Or put them in storage) that you don't need (gummi's, tm's etc.) so you have room for the important items. An ideal tool box would be (this is the one i always carry)<br>  <br>  99x Stick/Iron Thorn/Silver Spike (You don't have to have 99x but have a bit)<br>  99x Graveler rock (You don't have to have 99x but have a bit)<br>  (At least) 2x Oran Berry (For emergencies)<br>  (At least) 2x Huge Apple (If you don't have a tight belt. And don't eat them until you'r hunger reaches zero so you don't waste it. You won't pass out when your hunger reaches zero only when your hunger and your hp reaches it. Also, collect any apples you find coz you'll need them)<br>  (At least) 2x Reviver Seed (Coz you can't always not die in a dungeon)<br>  (At least) 2x Max Elixir (When your pp runs out. Only use when you don't have any more pp for all the moves or at least the moves that inflict damage and only if you need to use the moves)<br>  1x Escape Orb (For emergencies like when you're in a monster house and you've run out of oran berries and reviver seeds and your health is in the red zone and you don't want to faint coz you don't want to lose your money and items)<br>  <br>  If you carry all of those you should have at least half of your tool box left for collecting items you want or need.<br>  <br>  An easy way to beat Rayquaza if you don't to train is to have all four moves attacking moves. Then either go to gulpin link shop or find a link box and link all of them together. Also do this to your partner so when you fight rayquaza you and you partner get to attack four times while he only gets to attack once each turn (Until the pp of one of the moves finishes then the link breaks)<br>  <br>  If you want to train then go to the makuhita dojo (don't train in a dungeon it's not worth it) and if you're strong enough pick Team Constrictor and make sure your pokemon knows moves with lots of pp. Keep fighting the tentacool by using your moves (Not the normal attack) coz it doubles the experience points and for each tentacool you beat you get 198 exp points. Keep fighting them on the first floor until about half of the pp of your moves are gone then go to the second floor and repeat. Make sure you save some pp of the moves coz the bosses on the third floor take a bit more to go down. If you beat all of them with moves then you'll get ~1800 exp points. If you don't then you'll get ~900 to ~1500 (depends if you use moves on some of them)<br>  <br>  If you want the tight belt then here's a wonder mail code for the tight belt. You have to do the mission and if you succeed then you'll get it as a reward. Don't worry i made this code a while back and it's REALLY easy.<br>  Client: Gyarados<br>  What you do: Find him an Oran Berry.<br>  Where: Tiny Woods<br>  Reward: Tight Belt<br>  Code.<br>  4?-N 6(M)...? ?Q?H<br>  ...M?? 84?7 (or T. i can't read my writing) ...P?W<br>  <br>  (M) is the weird sign with the arrow on the circle.

m8ikUOHFaa	1: It is illegal to download a rom even if you have the game on its original cart (when you buy a game you own the license to that specific cart and only that cart)<br>  <br>  2: Emulators can be very glitchy depending on what they're used on, if the rom was dupped correctly, and another of various reasons. My guess is that the emulator isn't good for playing that pokemon rom.
eRu9sPT1aa	It depends on what you need, power or rapid fire. If i`m starting a new game I will keep hold of the red 9 as when it is upgraded it is a very powerful weapon, it maxes out at 6.5, which is considerable as the riot gun starts off at level 5. The blacktail however is a lot quicker at aiming and maxes out at 4.5, it also fires quicker and reloads in no time whatsoever. If I had to choose I would go with the red 9 purely for the stopping power. If i was just having fun it would be the blacktail.

vHbiUhOCaa	Usually, yeah it's fine to put your hands up.<br>  You can kinda guess though which rides might be dangerous in doing so (indoor dark ride; might have tunnels etc which your arms could hit by accident). <br>  <br>  I've seen a lot of water rides that say keep your hands inside the car at all times yet people always put their arms up at the big drop !<br>  I think it's just a safety measure; all parks should mention any safety hazards to riders, especially if the rider could potentially fall out.<br>   <br>  I also think it's just a way for the park to get out of being sued if that ever did happen! "Well we do have signs up saying to keep your hands in the vehicle at all times..."|`|2n6HSiF0aa	its okay to put your hand straight up on rides. but make sure not to extend your arms farther than the width of the actually "car" you're in.|`|8zE2gjReaa	you can put ur hands up as long as they are not outside the width of the car. I don't know if Disneyland has a Space Mountain, But keep your hands down if you ride that one i heard (not sure if its true or not) that the clearance is not big enough to raise your hands up. This is probably false because I'm sure people have put their hands up and have been okay

If you sign up to get joann's emails, they not only send you coupons there, but you'll also receive a circular in the mail  every couple of weeks that includes a 40% off coupon, and when they are having a special 3-4 day sale, it'll include a lot of coupons to use during that sale.  <br>  <br>  The only problem I have with those 40% off coupons is that they are only good for regular priced items.

They scan coupons so other stores codes wouldn't show up in their system. I know that Michaels sometimes gives you coupons on the receipt. You could take a risk and buy something cheap, and hope to get a coupon on you receipt. Also you could ask the person at the counter if they have coupons because sometimes they only give them if people asked or ask if there are any up coming sales. And if that still doesn't work you could try websites like craigslist or freecycle and hope to find some free pain at a cheap price or for free!<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!

Another great one is  <a href="http://www.tammyyee.com/origami.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tammyyee.com/origami.html</a> <br>  <br>  and  <a href="http://www.origamicorner.com/origamiforkids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.origamicorner.com/origamifork...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.cox.net/crandall11/money/" rel="nofollow">http://members.cox.net/crandall11/money/</a>  (Try the ring ... easy and cool.)<br>  <br>  You could Google "free easy origami" and find lots more.<br>  <br>  Regular origami paper is square.  If you don't want to buy special paper, you can cut your own, pretty much any size, although squares of 4 inches or larger are easier to work with.  Beginners usually start with 6 or 7 inch square paper. Just be sure what you cut is perfectly square or your figures will come out a little "off."   Here's a link that shows how to make regular paper square ...  <a href="http://www.papercrafty.com/2006/how-to-make-square-paper-for-origami" rel="nofollow">http://www.papercrafty.com/2006/how-to-m...</a><br>  <br>   You can use newspaper, typing paper, gift wrap, old calendar pages, etc.  If you don't want to cut or buy squares, there are patterns that work with 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper, and even dollar bills! You just have to look for them.|`|wusHytj2aa	<a href="http://familyfun.go.com/" rel="nofollow">http://familyfun.go.com/</a>|`|iGDB3MJAaa	It sounds like scrapbooking might be perfect for you.

mHQl6FmGaa	So I take it you've turned on the option to automatically pick up the microphone? If not, L3 is the talk button.<br>  <br>  I would also test this speech thing, because most players on PS3 get feedback going into their mic so it looks like people are talking when they really aren't.<br>  <br>  If you still have problems and your certain people are talking, then I would contact Play Station through support and tell them your scenario.

obPSaYf3aa	I've bowled with Brunswick Corporation (Brunswick, Brunswick Int'l., MoRich, Revolution, Elite and Quantum) products for over 27 years and have no problem with their equipment.  Actually, the "cheap ones" that don't work, are called "spare balls" because although they are made of polyester and plastic, even professional bowlers need them in their bags to pick up spares and to tackle the driest lane conditions.<br>  <br>  Is he a beginner, intermediate or advanced bowler?  These bowling ball manufacturers have equipment suited for all ages, skill levels and budgets, and are as follows:<br>  <br>  Ebonite International, which includes; Columbia 300 Industries, Hammer Bowling, Track International, Dyno-Thane (Overseas brand only).<br>   <br>  Brunswick Corporation, which includes; Viz-A-Ball, Elite (Produced by Brunswick), Quantum (contract made by Brunswick overseas), Revolution Bowling (Overseas brand only), MoRich Enterprises (contract made by Brunswick).<br>   <br>  Visionary Bowling Products <br>  <br>  Storm Bowling, which includes; Roto Grip and AZO (contract made by Storm) <br>  <br>  900 Global, which includes; AMF (made by 900 Global) and Lane #1 (contract made by 900 Global).<br>   <br>  Lane Masters <br>  <br>  Legends Bowling <br>  <br>  They all make spare balls up to high performance bowling equipment.  Please check out bowling.com, bowlersparadise.com, bowlingball.com for further information, specs and prices on these bowling balls.  Good luck!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, this is actually a difficult question to answer based on the facts that you gave.  You want a unique ball which doesn't tell me a whole lot since most bowling balls are unique in their own way.  I mean, you aren't going to go to a pro shop and buy a plain colored ball like they have in the house, all of them have some kind of unique design to them.<br>  <br>  The biggest question I would need to know, in order to help you pick a ball, is what kind of bowler is your son?  Does he throw a hook or just a straight ball.  Does he have a fingertip grip or a conventional?  If he's the type of bowler that just throws a straight ball, then in all honesty it doesn't matter much what type of ball he gets.  Most people who throw straight balls get cheaper plastic balls, and all plastic balls are essentially the same, with the only difference being the outer design.  Personally, I just go for a ball that looks good in this category, since I only use it for right side spares, like the 10-pin.  <br>  <br>  If he throws a hook, then you have more choices that might make a difference.  Another thing that would make a difference is how old he is and how heavy a ball he wants to use and how much you want to spend.  For example, you said 10-16 lbs, thats a BIG difference.  If you're going to go with a 10 lb ball, I would suggest going with an entry level reactive.  The reason is that I wouldnt want to suggest going with a high performance ball and spending like $250 for something he probably wont use long.  The only real options that someone will actually continue to bowl with are 15 or 16.  There are a ton of options to make when it comes to bowling balls though, and you can either let us know a little more about your son's style, or just bring him to the local pro shop and talk to the guy there, as they usually know what they're talking about.

Mo5TIxZwaa	This is a very good question with many different answers. I will vaguely touch on some of the different money making methods I have used if you would like more details on any one please feel free to contact me either in game or via yahoo.<br>  …1)Non combat skills<br>  ~Fishing~ Sharks, and monk fish, Fishing trawler for Manta ray and sea turtle you can even “free load” although this is unpopular with other players.<br>  ~Hunting~ polar kebbits, carnivorous chinchompas (stackable)<br>  ~Farming~ Grow Marigolds, ranarr, snapdragon, spirit weed and toadflax.<br>  ~rune crafting~ is almost always profitable (You can kill Banshee's for noted pure essence a lot faster than mining for it ) If your not high enough for laws or natures there are worlds where you can run these for others.<br>  ~Cooking~ Tuna Potatoes, curry stew, and pizza’s<br>  ~Thieving~ cave goblin wires from Dorgesh-kaan.<br>  ~construction~ Make Teletabs via Lectern in player owned house.<br>  ~Mining~ coal is slow but pays very well. If you are high enough Adamintite and Runite.<br>  …2) Using Combat<br>  ~Dragons using Melee or Range.<br>  Green dragons in the Wildy or in the chaos tunnels,<br>  Blue dragons in Edgeville dungeon, in ogre enclave and there is one in legends guild.<br>  Black dragons with 70+ ranged or Kill them with protect from Melee (this cuts into profit as your using prayer potions though this can be minimalized by using prayer saving armor)<br>  ~Chaos druids, Unicorns, Moss giants, Vampires, White wolves, Cockroaches, Jungle spiders, Iban Disciples and Avanasis are all good monsters to fight for profitable drops.<br>  *If you’re not interested in the prayer experience you can always kill and sell the bones. Ourg, Daganoth. Raurg, Fayrg and Dragon, sell best but even regular bones sell well.<br>  ** A fast way to big money is PKing but this is a risky endeavor. You can loose just as well as win. Remember there is always someone bigger and meaner than you... So you are liable to loose more money than you win. The more you risk the better your pay off its all on how gutsy you are.<br>  …3) Slayer~ In general Slayer monsters pay well. Consider the food you use an investment. Most assignments drops more than pay for the food needed to fight them. The possibility of receiving a rare drop makes them even more enticing.<br>  …4) Merchanting...watch the prices on the exchange then buy popular items when low and sell when high… There are several items you can buy in shops all over Runescape then sell for profit at the exchange, but as most of these are not stackable this can take several runs. Pineapples, seaweed, vials, bolts of cloth, Sacks, baskets, dyes, tinderboxes and Battlestaves are all examples of items that can be bought in stores all over Runescape and sold on the exchange for more.<br>  … 5) There are several quests that are well worth the effort.After doing the Throne of Miscellania (and Royal trouble) quests,You can get your kingdom workers to gather resources that can be sold. And if you do the Hand in sand quest you can get free sand daily.<br>  …6) You can collect Snape grass, Mort myre fungus, Planks, White berries, Potato cacti, Flax (Spin the flax into bowstrings for even more profit),Red spider eggs, Blue dragon scales, and Swamp tar. All these sell well.<br>  …7)Clue scrolls are a roll of the dice but they have the possibility of large large payoffs! Clue scrolls which are dropped by certain monsters more often then others... (I kill Daganoth’s with a cannon to get mine fast ) .<br>  … 8) You can hang out at the Falador drop room... I find wearing a ring of wealth helps (this is controversial)... it’s just up to luck what you can get and how fast you can get it.<br>  …9) One of the newest ways of making money is the recent Diversions and distractions addition... Penguin hunting can make as much as 97.5k a week and Shooting stars can give you 106 k a day in runes coins and ore.<br>  ….The thing is the game is designed to take time (which is why my answer is so long).. Your suppose to have to work for it. Jagex does a good job of making sure there are no quick ways to fast cash! I answer this same question for a lot of people, often they want to know which one is the best method. There is no best method. They are all good solid ways to try out and figure which one YOU like the best (my personal favorite is chaos druids)... remember the point of the game is to have fun. So find the one you like, sit back relax and enjoy!|`|zfrPmiFtaa	Grand Exchange. <br>  Find out which items sell for the most and what's easiest for you to get and sell them in bulk at the GE. (It's in varrock if you didn't know) Things that are hard to get or things that people are willing to buy instead of get for themselves, like runes or rune essence, feathers for fishing, or cooking supplies. I make a lot of money this way.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	well i fish lobs for money, but i lost it all in pvp :P<br>  so i would fish lobs or sharks<br>  <br>  if u really want money fast, i would kill chaos druids and pick up the ranarrs and kwarns|`|6DfXlZpxaa	what i do is fight dark wizards in south varrok and pick up the runes and the wizards armor, but you wanna have wizard armor on because they will hit higher if you have regular rune armor on, also if your a member i would say the flesh crawlers would be good for getting $$$, i would pick up the herb and the gems.|`|rm2kykQEaa	Fish lobs it's good money<br>  Hunt grey chinchompa at 53 hunter, and red chinchmpa at like 63 hunter<br>  Kill things that drop big bones, and sell the big bones.<br>  Cut trees. E.g Willows, or yews.

No nature boosts hp only charecteristics do. If a pokemon has an Impish nature then their Defence gets a boost but their Special Attack gets lowered a bit. All pokemon have natures.

Hardy, Docile, Serious, Bashful and Quirky) boosts and hinders a stat.

By using macro cosmos it screws up many of the leading decks such as lightsworns and even the almost dead teledad.  Furthermore by removing monsters from play they are not in the graveyard needed for several OTK.   Overall it is cheap with a few exceptions such as solemn judgement or dark bribe (not needed but help).  And with the end of tele-dads speed meta, this monarch deck is ready for its chance to reign as the top deck.  Several of the other top decks such as lightsworns are exceptionally expensive with judgement dragon at 100 alone.

Jbkk7NrJaa	Their policy is NOT to sell it to you or give it to you if you are under 17. But it really depends on the person there, how well you act and present yourself, if you look old enough and not give them a hard time or act like a dork they may trade it in for you, seeing as you are giving another M rated game in to them. <br>  <br>  They may also call your parent, I remember about 3 years ago when I was 15 they called my mom, she said it was alright.<br>  <br>  Another alternative, which is risky, is if you look 17 but they DO ask you a question, answer it swiftly and responsibly. I remember one time I was in Hollywood Video when I was about 16 or so, I wanted to rent Halo or something and they asked for my date of birth and I quickly said something along the lines of 5/22/88 (Which would make me old enough to rent the game but it was a lie, and also I was using my moms card for the place.)|`|fmIWVji7aa	you will just get store credits towards your new game|`|pl2SocVKaa	no they still won't let you do it you need someone who is 17

FAOJlNkHaa	There is no best, and is entirely dependent on what kind of play style you want. There are three archetypal roles: Tank, DPS(Damage Dealing), and Healer, as well as sub-types on each one (Like AoE healing vs Single target, Ranged vs Melee Damage). After you find what role you want to play, you can research the classes that fit that role and see which suits your tastes. As for race, pick the one that appeals to you the most. The pros and cons of choosing a race is negligible at best. <a href="http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-USA-c-51.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com/World-of-Warcraft-...</a>|`|gr2SdOQIaa	depends on what you want to do for raids/PVP in the future<br>  pvp:alliance<br>  close combat=gnome rouge(because there hard to target)<br>  casting human mage or warlock<br>  heal=drenie shaman(if don't have expansion get pally any race)<br>  then if want pet hunter any race(night elves get bows dwarfs get guns you can train for the other)<br>  raid=<br>  tank:warrior or pally (you can try druid:bear i don't recommend it tho)<br>  heal:druid if you want to be a tank healer. shaman to heal group pally:can heal both priest:usually with a tank<br>  dps:pretty much all classes ask your guild what they would need for DPS(dps:damage per second meaning you'll do a ton of damage<br>  pvp= horde<br>  close combat: turren warrior(there racial skill can stun people) or a blood elf pally<br>  cast:undead warlock or moonkin(a druid)<br>  heal:priest or shaman any race<br>  <br>  dang that took a long time to type <br>  HAVE FUN|`|sJS4ZZMoaa	It depends what you wanna do...<br>  If you wanna take on a lot of enemies and not lose a lot of health... warrior<br>  If you wanna melee dps then go... rogue<br>  IF you wanna out dps everyone... warlock<br>  If you wanna take out enemies from far away casting and nuking...mage<br>  If you want to do a bit of everything go... hunter<br>  Druids and shamans can do a lot of things and are very versatile... they are also very fun<br>  I would not recommend rolling a paladin as they are tough to level in higher levels even though they are hard to kill....<br>  <br>  If I could choose again...

Some classes, like druids and shamans, have only one race that can play that class.  I play Alliance, so I will use that as an example.<br>  <br>  Shaman:  only a Draenei can play a shaman<br>  <br>  Druid:  Only a night elf can play a druid<br>  <br>  Priest:  several races can be priests, but humans are best because they get a natural bonus to their spirit, which determines how fast their mana regenerates (priests need lots of mana)<br>  <br>  Mage:  human again on this one because of the natural spirit bonus<br>  <br>  Rogue:  gnomes, because they are extremely hard to target in PvP<br>  <br>  Paladin:  the races that can play paladins are all equally good (but again, humans are a good choice because of the natural spirit bonus)<br>  <br>  Warrior:  dwarves, because their stoneform negates all status effects such as disease, poison, etc.  Warriors cannot heal or cure anything, so having the stoneform ability is a real asset<br>  <br>  Hunter:  dwarves.  Dwarves have a natural bonus ability with guns, and a hunter's main weapon is a gun.<br>  <br>  Warlock:  again, a human with its bonus spirit<br>  <br>  Death Knight:  any race can be a death knight, but gnome females make awesome death knights just because their voices sound so creepy.

j6MvCr6Naa	You can't, but I do remember that in one certain mission you fly to Liberty City (I think) and shoot lots of guys. But I'm not certain, it could be another city, one thing's for sure though, and it's that you will fly to "some" city.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you want to see Liberty City, you should get GTA IV.
