DtkLsetkaa	I have to admit, you sound much more mature than most young kids and adults asking this type of question.  You have given this a lot of thought, but one thing you need to keep at the front of your mind is this is a life long commitment.  Not only emotionally, but financially.  Your time in school isn't a huge deal, but i still wouldn't get a very young kitten, maybe one 5-6 months old.  Still though, it might be best for you to wait until you are out of school and settled in your own place.  Transition for the cat would be easier and you would have a life routine in place that would make it easier on both of you.  Just some things to think about.<br>  <br>  Your reason for leaving the cat is perfectly valid in my opinion.  If its a family pet, its totally fine to leave it with the family.  They love it just as much as you do :)|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	For me the issue would be commitment and you already left a cat behind in Norway.  A kitten who is properly cared for and kept indoors can live for up to 20 years.  You're very young and will have life-altering events come up in the future.  What if you marry and have a child who is allergic to cats?  What if you find a new job and have to move somewhere that doesn't allow cats?  Until you settle in your life you can't really make a 20 year commitment.  The fact that your mom doesn't want a cat and you live with her is a big red flag.  I'd wait awhile.|`|evnj2DUpaa	Yes. You are ready for a pet kitten! But I wouldn't recommend getting one that is under the age of 7 months, they are very mischievous! Also make sure that he/she is spayed/neutered. It calms them down a lot! For you, I would recommend a female, they are very easy to care for and love you unconditionally. A Russian Blue would suit you perfectly, they are loving and fairly quiet, and they are very lean and graceful!|`|VTee51r9aa	Based on what you wrote "I used to have a cat back in norway where i use to live but moved to the uk" So you left your cat behind?!? based on that I would say no I don't think you should get a kitten. I don't believe anyone should get an animal unless they can committ to having that animal for as long as it lives.|`|aperMRNRaa	yes you have the time to bring up a kitten, get cat litter wood based from wilko, when the cat goes it does not spell|`|0zriLTZXaa	Yes you should get a gray tabby. They are so cute and playful.
evnj2DUpaa	That's a very good question. Odd-eyes are very common in white cats. Some even say that they are blind in one eye! Don't worry, she is not harmed be this, it is just the way she was created...beautifully! Hope I answered your question!|`|tMawuuUXaa	Its all genetics in this case.  Basically, while she was developing in her mothers tummy, the gene that caused her to be white prevented pigment from reaching her odd, or blue, eye. Either way, there's nothing wrong with her, though she might have a slight chance for deafness in the ear that's above the blue eye. She sure is a pretty kitty though! :]<br>  <br>  There's a Wikipedia article about it, if you'd like to read a little bit more: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd-eyed_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd-eyed_ca...</a>|`|ex1Kuy1caa	wall eye :)<br>  <br>  and i would take her to the vet white coated, blue eyed cats can be deaf|`|MSl6tMTvaa	ur cat is a turkish van look it up on google in images|`|ESwB3ETraa	its just something that happens, its called having a wall eye :)<br>  <br>  it doesnt mean that there is anything wrong with her though<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|RN1wGlWWaa	White cats either have 2 blue eyes, 2 gold/yellow eyes or one of each.  Just means she got the color from both parents :)|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	She's absolutely beautiful and it does happen occasionally.  You should have her vet test for deafness though.  All blue eyed white cats have the highest risk.  Those with one blue eye sometimes do too - sometimes in just one ear.  You should also protect her from the sun - she can get her pink nose and ears sunburned and it can lead to cancer. These are special risks of white cats.<br>  <br>  I had a blue eyed white cat that was not deaf - she was rare - our vet was surprised she had normal hearing.
YoZZDqq9aa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Consider the garbage that most Americans fed their dogs back in the fifties and sixties. They didn't even list the ingredients back then, and they still managed to raise perfectly healthy animals.<br>  <br>  Simply purchase the best you can afford, knowing that it's 100% better than what your dogs ancestors ate back in the day!|`|2iFQerjraa	Purina one puppy food is good.|`|FgdJpfiVaa	walmart is fine!<br>  so is Target<br>  same brands as other stores|`|cSOwqXKxaa	Hello!  Congratulations on your new puppy!<br>  <br>  I quite understand you're on a budget, but I have not found a good food at Wal-Mart, ever.  If you insist on shopping at Wal-Mart, at least switch your dog to Newman's Own - it's organic and doesn't have corn and wheat, instead they uses more soluable grains like barley, oats, millet, flaxseed, things like that.  And it is organic, which means no growth hormones, pesticides, or other unnatural poisons for your new pup!<br>  <br>  Since you have a german shepherd, I wouldn't necessarily worry about having him on a "puppy" food.  Just get him Newman's Own and stay far, far away from IAMS/Eukenuba, Purina, Pedigree, and other store or no-name brands like Alpo, Dad's, Kibbles n' Bits, Rachel Ray's Nutrish, Maxximum, etc.  These 'foods' are nothing more than diseased cow leftovers, the chemically melted remains of roadkill and Fido and Fluffy at the shelter, and floor sweepings and byproducts from making corn syrup.  Topped off with a healthy heap of carcinogenic dyes and preservatives.  Yum!<br>  <br>  I would also, if you don't care go completely raw in his diet (which I highly recommend!), at least give him fresh, meaty uncooked bones and fresh muscle and organ meats to supplement his diet.  These foods contain fresh, unaltered enzymes, and raw bones will go a long way towards keeping his teeth clean and healthy and free of gum disease.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your puppy!  : )|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	It's FINE!<br>  Any decent dry *ADULT* feed is FINE.<br>  Don't let the feed-nazis bully you.<br>  Their mantra goes"*I* spoil my dog more than *you* do! So,*I'M* a better mommy. nyah nyah!"  It's their only bragging point,poor things.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	There are places on the internet that you can purchase dog food if it is a concern to you - just a suggestion if it is something you would be willing to do.  Also, keep in mind that the higher priced higher quality foods have less fillers in them so the dogs do not need to eat as much, so that helps to offset the price.  Also keep in mind that you are caring for this animal and that is the most important thing.  So if you can't afford the higher quality foods that is fine -  just remember that you are still a great doggy parent just for being concerned!|`|xJKJDyyMaa	i just recently bought a black lab puppy and like you started on puppy chow the petstore said it is one of the worst like you said so i switched him to pedigree , he loves it and it makes his fur have a healthier and shiny coat. Its the only one i consider buying from walmart  and like you probably know its like $12 for a big bag|`|GZwzacY8aa	pedigree is very good for them that is what i feed my dog and she loves it and she is healthy but what ever you do he will get the ruins from switching dog food at first but it is normal and after that is over he probably wont poop so much because his body is absorbing more of it|`|26PPwzrWaa	Actually you can: <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=costfactors" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  And as for high quality: You could feed prey model raw.

TFqSJiHqaa	Sounds like you have a good plan with putting a door on the litter box. I know my dogs would always have their noses in the litter. I was thinking raise the litter pan where the dogs couldn't reach it and the cat could jump up to it, but I don't know if that would be possible. Like, on a home built scratching post with carpet on it (those things can get expensive!) Good Luck|`|3giaPYe8aa	I would not lock the cat in the baby's room, at least not while the baby was in there sleeping.  A cat can do serious harm to a baby, just like a dog can.  Put the cat box somewhere that the dogs can't get to it, put the cat food up on a counter, and don't free feed the dogs, so the cats can't eat the dog food.  What the heck is a Doverman?  The breed is called Doberman.|`|KmC0K59taa	I have a 22 month old child as well and I could not imagine having 9 dogs and a cat.  How clean is this environment for your child?  Why do you have so many dogs?  Are some puppies that are going to new homes?  Do not put a littler box in the child's room.  Would you want to breathe in cat pee and poop all night long?  <br>  <br>  I have a new puppy and an old cat myself, but my child and her health is my number one priority.  I think all those animals are a little too much, sorry.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Kia,<br>  <br>  ConCATulations on your breakthough with Dexter! That is great.<br>  <br>  While the concept of using a similar texture to the bottom of your couch sounds logical on first glance, Deb would not be able to differentiate which is ok. It would be really confusing to her to praise her for a horizontal material covered scratcher and to be less than thrilled with the couch attack. So I would find something that is completely different in texture.<br>  <br>  There is an "Alpine" scratcher which my cats adore. <br>  <a href="http://www.petguys.com/-079593113000.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petguys.com/-079593113000.htm...</a><br>  There is a toy inside the framework for cats to "hunt" as well.  I think this one will suit her to a "T".<br>  <br>  Another possible solution is getting a carpet sample ( they are usually about the same size as a doormat) and find a way to fasten it to the bottom of a wall. We have them all around the house, actually, with the backing material of the carpet turned upwards. The cats do a number on them, when they are not working the high verticle cat tree.<br>  <br>  You might also try "bitter apple" on the bottom of your couch, or tack aluminum foil to the bottom. I know it is a pain to even consider it, but that might work as a deterent. I have never had much luck with citrus sprays, although United Parcel sells an orange scented spray which is powerful, safe and my cats do not appreciate that scent.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|IuYekkPVaa	I like Pretty Kitty's suggestion of covering a box with something for Deb to scratch.  Alternatively you could try a large scratch post and lay it on it's side.  She might even be tempted to use a wooden log.<br>  <br>  Please don't replace Dexter's scratcher no matter how tatty looking it becomes.  The reason he loves using it is because it's impregnated with his claw scent and it's that smell that prompts him to keep scratching there.  This is also the reason why Deb is continuing to scratch a certain area of your couch.   Generally cats don't scratch areas where they chin rub and Feliway mimics the scent from the facial glands.  Have you tried using Feliway to deter her from scratching there?|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Since she likes the flat surface, you might try covering a wooden box with upholstery material similar to what your sofa is covered in.  Put it near the sofa and place treats around it.  A friend of mine got one of those motion activated toys that sings loudly and put it in front of where the kitty was scratching.  It scared him away whenever he went to scratch.|`|FYByaCe4aa	Those upright scratchers can be dismantled and you can just use the upright part and lay it down in front of the couch. <br>  <br>  Your catnip isn't working?

PREVENT!!!!|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	Not all dogs doe from parvo. 1 of my dogs survived it. <br>  I got her shots, made her a special pallet and sat by her side for<br>  hours over the next several days. I had to give her water with a dropper and I fed her pet milk from Petco with a dropper. It took her nearly 2 weeks ot get on her feet, but she made it. They require a lot of attention though so they do not dehydrate.|`|kNscpF4Faa	Usually puppies and older dogs die of parvo young adults with treatment have a better chance..You can take them to vet for expensive treatment that doesn't always work..If your dog has parvo and you don't have money for treatment put your animal to sleep..Parvo symptoms are very painful with a lot of suffering to animal. Almost always once the bloody diarrhea has set in they usually cant recover from that and vets  will tell you .And next time get their parvo shot( you can buy a 7-in one shot from your local feed store and that prevents the parvo and 6 other diseases|`|uCJ4EQZraa	First thing to do is to quarantine your puppy from your other pets, children and any possible company. A crate and an exercise pen would do well for this. (in a private room with closed door and a window *you'll need it*)<br>   <br>  Put a vinyl tablecloth down to cover the exercise pen floor. They also sell 'show mats' just for going under exercise pens. Check suppliers such as Cherry Brook for these. You will throw these away after your done fighting the parvovirus. Cover all with a couple layers of newspaper and then I suggest a generous layer of cheap kitty litter. This will make the frequent cleanups quick, easy and will help cut down on the unmistakable parvo odor.<br>   <br>  Gather all your necessary supplies and have them near the puppy's area. Paper towels, bucket of bleach water - 30 parts water to 1 part bleach, disposable plastic grocery bags, pedialyte, collodial silver, vet RX medication, pepto bismol, supply of syringes, extra saline solution, notebook and supply of old towels or what I like to use: those cheapie $5 blankets cut up into 6 sections perfect for puppy sized blankies - something you won't mind throwing out when done. And an apron for yourself and a pair of slippers. You may opt for a box of disposable gloves. If not, wash hands with bleach water after dealing with puppy, each time.<br>   <br>  Keep slippers at door of this room. Put on and take off right at the door. This is to prevent tracking anything from one area to another. Wear your apron for the same reason.<br>   <br>  Let your puppy out of the crate to potty and clean up immediately upon it coming out, hopefully on the kitty litter. Sprinkle a helping of kitty litter on top of the infected feces and then scoop with kitty litter scoop into a plastic grocery bag and throw into a large garbage bag. You will want to take this garbage out frequently or the odor will take over your home. You may even want a plug in or renuzit type air freshener. Do not use sprays around your sick puppy.<br>   <br>   Give puppy collodial silver every 12 hours. Amount will depend on weight. Feel free to send me a message to ask advice since most vets will have no idea and no clue as to it's potent life saving qualities which I believe in. It doesn't take much. Example: for a 15 - 20 lb puppy, I would give 1 CC every 12 hours. It is all natural but you don't want to overdo it and put too many metals in the dog's liver. For your info look up "collodial silver testimonials" in quotes into google search engine and you should find valuable info on it's wonderful qualities. I get mine at Walmart for $26 a bottle.<br>   <br>  Give pepto bismol (generic is okay) 2 - 3 times a day. Gauge this need by how upset your puppy's tummy appears to be. Dosage would be equivalent to the collodial silver in most cases. Like people... it's harder to heal if you're in pain. <br>  Step8Give vet RX medications as prescribed <br>  Step9Give sterile saline solution (get from vet). Some vets may be willing to start the IV port for you so you can give it in this way and they would then instruct you on doing it this way. If not, you can give it SQ (under skin) by tenting the skin (usually at shoulder or top/base of neck) and injecting the saline with sterile needle/syringe which the vet can provide you with as well to ensure you have the proper sizes. Ask vet the amount to give. But the rule to remember is "Don't let the camel hump go dry". The saline will make a 'bubble' under the skin. The body will use this as needed and when the bubble is gone, you need more. Rotate the injection sites every couple of times as a sick puppy will not heal so well and you could get leaks from past injection sites. Please have your vet show you how to do this the first time. And remember not to make the bubble too big. This will cause pain. But you don't want a worthless tiny thing either. The vet can tell you the proper CC amount for your puppy's size. This is the 24 hour care part and why they may be better off at home with you, if your up for the challenge and can prevent it's spread to other dogs.<br>   <br>  You may wish to invest in some waterless dog shampoo. Not wise to give such a sick puppy a full out bath but keeping them as clean as possible is important.<br>   <br>  Take your puppy's temperature 2-3 times a day and note this in your notebook. Note EVERYTHING in your notebook. If your puppy is not on antibiotics already, you will need to watch for secondary infections, common when parvo destroys their immune system. Additionally, watch for too low of temps. Puppies lose their ability to regulate their own body temperature once parvo takes over in active stages.<br>   <br>  Keep a heating pad or heat lamp (using supreme care with either!) handy for if your puppy appears cold.<br>   <br>  Tell your friends and family that you have a puppy with parvovirus and that your home is off limits until your vet says otherwise.<br>   <br>  Offer food to your puppy but never force them to eat. Be prepared that it's normal for them to go 3-5 days with no food. Parvo causes the intestina|`|xorWk3CVaa	My puppy was diagnosed with parvo and did not die. We fed him the bland food diet and gave him lots of tender love and care, and he made it. He is a fighter. Young dog's usually can survive because their bodies can fight it better. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  It is not 100% fatal, that is not statistically possible. That would mean every dog EVER diagnosed (that did not get help) with it would die.

The last time I went to a circus I was probably 6.  I think what they do to the animals (particularly the elephants) is wrong, so I refuse to support them.  <br>  <br>  It's also fairly easy to obtain a list of companies that do not test on animals.

Around here, there are quite a few ranchers/farmers, so I try to purchase only from them.

NmSP12b2aa	1) Your sister should probably keep away from the gerbil until her cold has subsided because gerbils have really low immune systems which means that they can catch an infection very quickly and get badly affected by even a simple human cold<br>  <br>  2) All rodents love to burrow! Especially gerbils. 2-3 inches is fine.<br>  <br>  3) The igloo thing is probably just a habit; part of her personality, you know<br>  <br>  4) When trying to handle your gerbil, make sure you don't startle/frighten her: she has to be aware that you are there because if you randomly reach out to grab her, she'll run and might even try to attack. Slowly move your hand into the cage and let her sniff your hand and get used to the scent. She's new so she probably doesn't recognize your scent yet. <br>  <br>  After doing this a few times she might come on to your hand or let your pick her up. If she doesn't then never get angry of frustrated at the gerbil or else it probably won't trust you anymore. When she goes to your hand try and stroke her gently so she knows you're harmless. Eventually she will learn to trust you and let you pick hold her.<br>  <br>  5) Ok, I only just read this part! If she bites you she probably doesn't recognize your scent yet and or was startled by your hand fearing it as an enemy or something that wants to harm her. See above for more info on how to solve this.<br>  <br>  Romaine lettuce should be ok in moderation.<br>  <br>  Veggies: Asparagus, sweetcorn, peas, carrots, beans and broccoli are all good vegetables for gerbils<br>  <br>  Fruits (which should be given in moderation): bananas, apples, berries, mangoes, and pear (all fresh)<br>  <br>  Check out this site for good gerbil recipes: <a href="http://www.kimsgerbils.com/Gerbil_Diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kimsgerbils.com/Gerbil_Diet.h...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!

As for the bedding yes 2-3 inches is fine i have 2 inches in my cage. But if you feel like you should add another inch or so do it. Scraping on the side of the igloo i'm not real sure about. For mine when i want to hold her i put a treat in my palm and naturally she comes. NEVER pick her up by her tail because part of it can come off and i don't imagine thats too comfortable. Make sure you wash your hands with a non scented soap before handling her so she doesn't think your fingers are a treat! I had that problem to. Yes romaine lettuce should be fine but only sparingly and in small portions because too much can cause digestion problems and diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Fruits <br>  banana pieces<br>  apple slices<br>  orange cubes<br>  kiwi slices<br>  strawberry slices <br>  <br>  Veggies <br>  Pieces of broccoli<br>  corn<br>  lettuce <br>  cabbage<br>  i give mine baby carrot slices sometimes<br>  <br>  other<br>  cheerios pieces because they're not too high in fat or sugar and are a very healthy treat

It's also not that expensive, so that's another great thing.<br>  <br>  It comes in a few different types: you can get immediate odor control (blue stripe on the bag), long-lasting odor control (red stripe), or antimicrobial (green stripe). I usually just get the blue or red one, depending on how often you change the litter (blue for normal days, red if I'm going out of town). I've never used the green bag, so I'm not sure how much different it is.<br>  <br>  The scoop-able kind works well, but it creates a bit more dust than the regular.

It's a round litter box, and I find it is effective (I have 2 of them for the 3 cats I have), here are some results I found from google shopping: <a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=kitty+litter+box&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/products?q=kitty+l...</a>|`|eW5lrWiLaa	Just about any litter box, if you don't want it to stink i would, and have been since about 3 months ago, put a half a scoop of baking soda in with the litter. It works!|`|DtkLsetkaa	The litter box doesn't matter, its the litter, how often/well you clean it, and other factors that will matter.  First off, a covered litter box can lead to problems.  The cat will not like it for the same reasons you want it, its going to smell inside!!  They don't want to smell their own poo any more than you do, and if that smell gets trapped inside it can lead them to want to eliminate elsewhere.  I would recommend getting a neutral, plain smelling litter that will absorb the smells.  Make sure you use a liner to make clean up easier.  Also, place an air freshener close to the box and keep it very clean every single day (scrub it once a week with a little soap and water, VERY little soap).  Good luck!!!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	The litter pan will not keep the odor down no matter how much it costs. Cats like the ones with lids.<br>  <br>  If you are going to have 2 kittens (or cats) you are best off having 2-3 litter pans. <br>  <br>  You will have to wash them down once a week and scoop the litter in the am and at night. You will also have to put in and keep fresh litter in the pans. If it smells bad to a cat they won't use it and will use your house instead. They also hate dirty litter pans in general so be aware of how picky they are.<br>  <br>  Lay down a doormat made of green turf to catch the litter in their paws.<br>  <br>  Use a GOOD multi-cat kitty litter with odor control. <br>  <br>  It will take a lot of extra work to have a second kitty. I hope when you get it the kitten is housebroken. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.
RCyvGAONaa	Alot of things get a long with angels watch out for your fin nippers and things that are quite a lot smaller than angels such as neons, the angels will have them for breakfast lol <br>  Friendly chiclids such as rams get along fine with angels as do silver dollars, rainbow fish, gourami's, mollies, platys, swordtails, rosey barbs, silver sharks etc. <br>  <br>  The thing with fishkeeping is its a trial and error game, you learn from your mistakes so just give it a go anything thats peaceful and community should get on fine with your angels. If you're ever unsure just ask the person you're buying the fish from whether they think the certain fish will be ok with angels they'll be able to give you some guidance. good luck = )|`|ZGFXBie9aa	Well, I'm planning on having silver dollars and gouramis with my angels... those generally get alon nicely.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	angles,sword tails,guarani's, & barbs<br>  are good|`|JsBb732Maa	I have 8 angel fish ( so beautiful! ) and 5 tiger barbs, I was told as long as I kept the barbs in a group they wouldn't bother my angels, I have one Discus fish and they do good with angels, need the same water quality etc. I have two cory cats and a chinese algae eater.I want to put some guppies in the tank so the angels can have the babies as fresh food, so far I only have a male so I will get a couple of females to go with him. These are in a 55 gallon tank and so far very good.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	I have an angel fish, Gold dust Mollies, Swordtail, Painted Swordtail, Mickey Mouse Platy, Pleco, and a Albino Rainbow shark and they all get along great.
XrPwrWPcaa	I don't think you should get your sister another bird. One could get angry at the other and they could start a fight. I suggest maybe since you are upset about the loss of your bird and if you want one alot , you could get one for yourself? <br>  If the bird is already attached to your sister, there could be some territorial issues with getting it a friend.<br>  Hope this helps sorry to hear that your bird died...|`|qeOlkRM0aa	This isn't very clear. 1 bird died, and one got eaten?<br>  Did the eaten bird not die?<br>  How did the one die today?<br>  Either way, it doesn't really matter <br>  You people should NOT have any more birds. You CLEARLY are not capable of taking care of them. I shudder to think how the next one will die.<br>  DON'T DO IT!!! YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY MORE BIRDS!!!|`|KO5extXiaa	wait didn't the bird die?|`|JtTpfCMHaa	first off You should wait a while before introducing another bird not just because of the bird but for your sake<br>   You have not even dealt with the grief of the loss yet <br>  <br>  <br>  I am not clear but the bird that died was it in same cage as the bird who is living?<br>  If so take the bird out the cage and totally Clean that cage and everything in it In case the bird was sick Hopefully the other is not.<br>  <br>  Also when you do choose to get a new home I would place in it's own cage next to the new one after quarantine(30 days) and let them get used to one another than let them play and meet OUT the cage I place two cages on the bed with doors open and usually they will both go in the cage they choose to live in :0)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and sorry for your loss. It is not easy to lose a pet i have been through it more than I care to remember and I always also want to run out and get another Even though I KNOW and have been through just that and It was not a good situation  I kept comparing and wanting the new to be like the one now gone So give it some time ok?<br>  Than find a good Breeder and get you a baby.<br>  If you need help email me through my profile|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Yes, the bird will be lonely and looking for another buddy. Do some research first, give yourself some time to grieve, and when you get the new bird be sure to quarantine and slowly introduce.<br>  Also, I would suggest putting the cage somewhere up high where the rat cannot reach or in a different part of the house or something.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.|`|59385c60c5203e426c9a99719ae545fdaa	I presume you mean you and your sister both had birds and yours died. Depends on what type of birds they were and did they share a cage.|`|vjijiJT3aa	If she had two birds and one died yes get another one just like it for your sister and for the other bird.
VTee51r9aa	At our local Pet Smart they have chinchillas and the last time I was there they were abour $120 dollars. I'm not sure how much it would cost to buy all the supplies and food but I'm sure you could find that information online.|`|s34GP3Ioaa	If you buy the coat you don't have to feed them and coats don't bite.  Just don't take your coat out at night because someone might throw red paint on it.|`|UvPUopA8aa	Chin's aren't really cuddly especially at night they're nocturnal. Which means they're going to be most active at night. <br>  <br>  Ok back to your question the price on a chin depends where you you live, who you're buying from and the color of the chin. A standard grey from a breeder in my area (New England) usually cost between $65-$75. If you have no breeders where live an you have to go to a petstore you can expect the price to be higher. A petstore chin will charge anywhere from $100-$130 for a standard grey. <br>  If that's more than you're willing to pay. You can check your local animal shelter,craigslist or newpapers for people who are rehoming theirs.|`|OVQlnrdHaa	They cost anywhere from $100-$200 depending on where you go. Chinchillas typically live about 15 years, but 18-22 years is not uncommon.<br>  Body length about 10-14 inches; tail is another 5-6 inches or so. Chinchilla cages must be large, and multilevel cages with platforms, ramps, and perches are ideal. <br>  Along with regular access to a dust bath, chinchillas need a variety of toys to keep them busy and active, especially items for chewing to keep the incisor teeth in good condition. <br>  You must be gentle and consistent to gain the trust of a chinchilla. Chinchillas require a lot of roughage, and the diet should mainly be made up of a good quality grass hay along with pellets made for chinchillas. Treats should be given in moderation (one teaspoon per day in total). The digestive system of chinchillas is fairly sensitive so any diet changes should be gradual. <br>  Chinchillas are largely nocturnal so will be most active at night. Sometimes they are called crepuscular, meaning their activity peaks at dawn and dusk. In any case, they should be kept in a fairly quiet area during the day. <br>  They prefer a consistent routine for handling a feeding times and may be stressed out by changes to their routine. Since they are so active and playful, chinchillas need a roomy cage for exercise as well as daily playtime. Warm temperatures are more of a concern for chinchillas than cool temperatures, so care must be taken that pet chinchllas do not become overheated.

Xobbmd7Saa	Well not EVERYBODY at Dover can be smart. Dover is an awesome store. The staff is generally pretty smart. The key to Dover is to know your stuff. The store itself is great with a wide selection and reasonable prices. <br>  <br>  Do not ask the staff for too much help and nobody knows better than you what fits. Buy whatever you feel is good for you and if they try to talk you out of it. Say "This size is right for me" If they try to annoy you out of it, put the stuff on the counter and walk out...They will get the message :)|`|DdpvxfkNaa	I would recommend to online for Dover Saddlery. There service is great online!|`|nhGj844Gaa	I think Dover is great. People just have different tastes of how they like their riding gear to fit. I'm sure the lady at Dover gave you half chaps that were a little to tall because as you ride in them, they drop down just like a tall boot. Its much better than getting them the perfect height when they are new, having them drop down and then they look too short. But anyways, Dover has always had great service for me and just because your trainer didn't agree with the lady at Dover on how half chaps should fit when new doesn't mean Dover is a bad place to shop.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	One sales person does NOT make an entire store bad.  Call them up ask for the manager and tell them what happened.  Many times folks are afraid to report faulty sales people and the clerk then thinks they got away with bullying you.
ERjGLJaEaa	I think I paid $25. I just got basic because I never planned on showing or breeding my pup. I did get a training video and a month or something free of some doggie magazine. They mailed me the dogs "birth certificate" I call it that has all the family tree on it, so I thought that was neat. You can go to the AKC website and it will show you all the pricing and the benefits and everything.|`|3giaPYe8aa	If the breeder gave you the proper papers, all you have to do is read them.  It tells you right on the application what the cost is for registration only certificate, with an additional fee if you want a 3 or 4 generation pedigree if you want the silver or gold package.  It sounds to me that the breeder didn't give you the proper papers, as the application is quite simple and self explanatory.|`|JsBb732Maa	To register with AKC the cost will be on the reg. papers, you can just register or get a pedigree. It's cheaper to just register. If you register and later you might want to take obedience classes and enjoy it and would like to show and title your dog, agility is also fun. It fun for you and your dog but you would need to reg. to compete. Being able to go to trials is a lot of fun and I considered a great benefit.It is cheaper to register early, the older the puppy gets the higher the cost.|`|GaL66jbQaa	I don't remember the cost but the AKC has really great events that can only be entered if your dog is registered.  Goldens are great at agility and obedience.  they also have field trials but you have to be really commited to training.  If you don't want to compete in any of these events and are having her spayed it doesn't matter.  there is a deadline for registration though so if you think you might compete at some point go ahead and register.|`|Bw18seFqaa	if you dont plan on showing or breeding, thats up to you if you want to register her or not.<br>  <br>  There are non-conformation events too that you can enter your dog in for fun, such as flyball, agility, obedience, etc.. if you are interested in that.<br>  <br>  Its been a while since I registered a dog, I believe its about $15.  The fee should be written somewhere on your registration form.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It's better to do it right away because it's only $20 and if you change your mind later, it's $55 for 12 months and $85 for a two year old dog.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I have two AKC goldens too.  Since I wasn't going to show or breed, I didn't bother. If you plan on getting involved in AKC sponsored obedience or agility, you might consider it - but you can do it later if that happens.  One golden we got was already registered by the breeder, but we never did anything with it.<br>  <br>  For more on registering, the process and cost, go here:  www.akc.org
RCyvGAONaa	Ok first of all no responsible fish seller should sell a silver shark and a red tailed shark together. Red tailed sharks are extremely aggressive and territorial they are to be the only shark in the tank, most places say that red tail sharks are ok if they are the only shark in the tank from my experience of having one myself they are nothing but bullies and terrorise almost everything weaker than it in your tank. Silver sharks are ok quite peaceful as long as they are in a shoal of at least 4 and then each fish will get 2 30cm big. <br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to get rid of one of your sharks take it back to the pet store you bought it from. They may be fine and get along perfectly but that is a risk you're going to have to take. I have seen what my red tail shark does to other fish that aren't sharks i wouldnt like to think what it would do if it came across a shark in its tank and i have a 4ft tank he is still really territorial. <br>  They look cool when they are little but as they get bigger so does their attitude, personally if i were you and if you've got a big enough tank id keep the silver sharks they're much nicer but they do get really big. I wish i'd have picked silver sharks over my red tail shark he is one of the biggest mistakes i've made in my fishkeeping hobby.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped = )|`|c7zeseHDaa	Dang chicka, lots of fishies, I honestly wouldn't put them together, you never know what will happen.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You did not list tank size.<br>  <br>  Silver shark can be used to describe silver tipped sharks or bala sharks. <br>  -Balas require no less than 100 gallons, and should be kept in schools of six. They grow 12-14 inches.<br>  -The silver tipped shark is a catfish and grows very large. <br>  <br>  Any smaller than forty and you should have your friend return them. Because of the aggressiveness of the red tailed shark and the size the silver shark can attain I would recommend returning them both anyway.<br>  <br>  ~Your tank is just under 40 gallons. I would still recommend returning both fish. The silver shark grows too large, and the red tail is too aggressive.|`|D75rqaihaa	no they shouldnt, i had a shark once and all teh other fish killed the shark
97036da6f1d4b340bf2d09b0c3db3e3daa	Docking should be done between day 2 and 4, so usually day 3.  <br>  Cropping should be done between 7 and 12 weeks.  It all depends on when the vet likes to do them.  Most vets like between 8 and 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  Cropping all depends on the breed that is being cropped.  Dobermans are usually done around 8 to 9 weeks old.  Any doberman puppy that is cropped after 12 weeks has a 75% percent failure rate of their ears not standing.<br>  <br>  If you have a pure-breed dog that calls for a docked tail and the breeder did not do it, you can have the vet dock it at the same time their ears are done.  If you import a dog from England or some place close does not allow cropping or docking so a puppies tail will not be done when it is a newborn.  At 3 days old, a puppy doesn't have any nerves in his legs or tail, that is why docking is done then.<br>  <br>  Pricing all depends on the vet.  I live in Indiana the pricing varies from $60 (country vet) to $500.  The vet that charges the least is a great vet and all of his prices are really low.  He only does a medium crop that stand very well.  Another vet close by me will show crop (longer than a medium crop) for $350.  For boxes, dobermans, and great danes, I would stay away from the military cut (REALLY short crop).<br>  <br>  Ask the vet if they have any pictures of past dogs that they have cropped.  Ask to talk to the vet that wil be doing the cropping (you should already but just to make sure).  Ask them if you offer any help in aftercare and posting (taping of ears), the cost of it, and how long they offer it.  The show crops take longer to stand, like 3 to 4 months depending on the dog.<br>  <br>  Don't try to find the cheapest vet you can find!  You get what you pay for.  I have gone to the country vet that crops for $60 because he has a great rep, is in it for the animals, and has been a vet for about 40 years.|`|JsBb732Maa	Tails have to be done by day three or not done at all. I've never had the breed with ear cropping but they are older to get that done and if by a vet with good experience I have no problem with it.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Docking is done at 2-3 days with 5 being the absolute limit and generally only with puppies to weak to be docked at 2-3 days.  Cropping is done later that age varies a bit based on breed but with Dobies it is generally done at 7-9 weeks with 12 weeks the absolute limit  for cropping in a Dobie or your risk the ears not standing properly|`|C1eHfhrHaa	tail docking is done in the first few days of life.  experienced breeders will do this themselves so there is no cost to the new owner.  Ear cropping is done between six and 12 weeks of age.  The aftercare is a pain in the a**, and must be done or the whole thing is a waste. I usually recommend that you get the ears done at the same place the breeder gets theirs done.  Our breeder took our pup to Canada because *her* breeder gets them done at this one vets and can go in the room with them to make sure it is done properly. You can expect to pay between $350 and $500 for this.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Docking(& dews) is done at 3 DAYS.<br>  Cropping MUST be delayed for weeks,to allow proper judgment of what suits the particular pup. I wouldn't crop til at least 10 wks.<br>  <br>  Docking is quick & easy & should be cheap;$10 per?<br>  Cropping requires ARTISTRY as well as a sharp knife. Definitely find a recommended -by-show breeders vet & have a couple/three hundred on hand.<br>  <br>  My breed is docked. I have,do & WILL CONTINUE to dock & NOT allow the cry-baby know-nothings to dictate to me!<br>  If my breed was cropped,I'd crop too.<br>  <br>  Do NOT tell me what to do w/ MY property.|`|OFaImbSiaa	Docking should be done at 3 days, cropping should be done at 8-12 weeks<br>  <br>  Its the owners personal choice, as it is LEGAL, I hate how people try to talk other people out of it, if you dont like it, then dont do it to your dogs, but if someone else does want to do it, leave them alone, its their business, im fine with it as long as its done by an experienced vet.

RCyvGAONaa	I had a 35L tank and had quite a lot of room and had much more than just 4 neons in there so maybe you could bump the number of neons you have and get something like a molly or a platy something with a lot of colour and generally they don't need to be with their own kind they do just fine on their own. being by themselves stops them from breeding which is a bonus lol another suggestion could be female fighter fish they don't get very big and are quite cute. or you could try male dwarf gourami's they come in quite nice colours blue and red almost like flip paint and they'll do fine on their own also but you'll have room for 2 of them anyway. <br>  <br>  good luck finding your fish i hope i've given you something to think about = )|`|bIh5ZFwIaa	if you don't fancy another betta you could try a dwarf gourami but only one<br>  <br>  or you could add like 3 male endlers, i breed N class endlers and see loads in my store and they do well without females, it just means you wont get any baby's<br>  <br>  but its a personal thing what you add to your tank, but if you need anything just pop me an email and ill get back to you
tMawuuUXaa	Well, she might just be trying to take a break for a moment from her new baby; all mommy's need to once in a while! She might be putting it behind the toilet because she thinks that is the safest place to keep him while shes away, and I'm sure she knows where and how to find her kitten. Momma cats know when their babies need them.<br>  <br>  Did she have more than one kitten to start with?? She might be looking for her other missing kittens if she had more, which is why she looks like she's lost something.|`|evnj2DUpaa	Your cat is feeling very insecure and scared right now. Keep a close eye on her, and you may need to start helping the boy kitty if she keeps ignoring him.You may have to involve your vet if this keeps happening, so for now move your cat and her kittens to a quiet place where no one goes often, like your room. I really hope she can raise her kittens, I'm sure she will do fine with your help!|`|JPZRpyX9aa	Sweetie, is the boy cat the father of the kitten? She may be stressing because he is following her around. She is probably not feeling that her babies are safe around him and is trying to get the kitten out of harm's way. Try putting her somewhere in a room where he can't follow them. Male cats have been known to kill kittens so that the female cat can come into heat and be ready to mate again. This may be what is happening. I would suggest you seperate them a.s.a.p.!|`|gB2w6z2Laa	Because she thinks she's transporting her kitten to a safer place|`|GoEdpprvaa	Mother cats do that when they think the kitten is sick & they don't want it to spread to the others.

Don't worry about it, just make sure to keep up handling and playing with both of them and then you'll also be able to watch them preen and enjoy each other - best of both worlds. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|Nb0SBUK6aa	Don't put two males cockatiels in the same cage.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	If the birds do not get into territorial fights then it will be okay and nothing to worry about. Your bird will still love you.
enC9TvxUaa	-Ignore the bad/loud behavior!  To him, any attention is good- even when you are yelling at him to stop his yelling!  Ignore it, and should help.  <br>  <br>  The new words, just keep repeating the same thing over and over as you did with the ones he already knows!  Say shorter words, then add to them if you are trying to get him to say phrases.  <br>  <br>  Again, the loud part may never go away, he is a bird and that is what they do!  Be thankful for the talking!!!!|`|hOVzviFIaa	African Grey parrots are the best!<br>  Repeat a CD or something with the words you want him to learn, especially when your bird is alone in the house.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT! Do not yell "NO" at your bird. They make loud noises to get your attention, by yelling at them you only encourage them. What you want to do is either walk away and say nothing until he quiets down, then praise your bird for being quiet. You can also throw a blanket over their cage and walk away as well.|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	Unfortunately, birds can be loud at times, that just what they do.  However, if you want to encourage him to be quieter, pay more attention to him when he's being quiet, and ignore him (turn your back, or leave him alone) when he makes those unpleasantly loud sounds.<br>  <br>  Talk to him like he is a small child.  Keep your sentences and the words simple.  Use the same greeting when he awakes up in the morning, another when you leave for work, and another for coming home.  Always say the words you want to have him learn, with enthusiasm, and in a happy tone.  Words said with passion are the ones they tend to repeat (and this includes swear words), so be careful about what you say in front of him.  ;)|`|hmv10DGoaa	the best way is to just keep repeating the words like hello, hello, goodbye and so on. it may take a while but eventually he will catch on. i have a cd that repeats words and other things. to stop making loud sounds say no!! NO!! when he does do it and when isn't screeching or when he stops give him a treat or something. ;)<br>  hope this helps....:)

sDwN4XuIaa	I give my dog a mixture of Raw and dog food.  She just went to the vet and they told us she is as healthy as a horse and we are doing a great job with her.  I give her htings like plain yogurt- cutts down on gas, cottage cheese- she likes it, Avacado- it is not toxic as most think, it is bad in large amounts though as in to much fat, Raw egg- shell and all, the shell gives them calcium, milk, tomato, liver, Kidney, Beef, Chicken, chicken bones- uncooked is fine for dogs, beef bones, and many other raw things.  She does well and l;ove sher food.  At times she doesnt eat all of it, but that is because they know when they need ot eat, at least some dogs do, and at times they may leave a little on their plate|`|csDhZDvraa	Its fine. Just watch out that he doesnt get alittle pudgey around the midsection from the added treat.<br>  <br>  Somtimes mixing warm canned dog food with my picky dogs food will get her to eat.

kUE3Ddktaa	Small brown dots might just be earwax. However, debris with appearance of coffee grounds is one of the external signs of ear mites.<br>  <br>  Watch her carefully to see if she shows any signs of irritation - does she rub her ears against the floor or furniture like they're bothering here? Does she scratch in her ears a lot? Shake her head vigorously?<br>  <br>  This site can help you identify the signs of mite infestation:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thepetcenter.com/gen/em.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepetcenter.com/gen/em.html</a><br>  <br>  If you think she has mites, it would be good to get her to the vet sooner rather than later because it's very uncomfortable for your cat - if you had an itchy rash, you wouldn't leave it untreated for two weeks.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Ear mites look like dirt in the ears.  They are really annoying to your kitty and if left untreated can cause lots of problems with the ears.  I would go ahead and take her to the vet.  Ear mite treatment isn't expensive.  Would you want to live 2 more weeks with mites in your ears?  She needs that check up anyway.  Whatever you do, don't go poking around in her ears till a vet shows you how to do it safely.|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	She mite have.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Sounds like mites. You're going to need a vet in this case. Not to cure the cat per say... but to get you the meds you need. Also to confirm its mites not yeast. They can present similar, dark blackish red coffee ground type funk in the ears, and you need to be sure as treating for the wrong thing can make the condition worse. Some cats also just naturally have dark ear wax. It does not mean they have mites. So confirm it before you try to treat. <br>  <br>  Everything you ever needed to know can be found here but I’ll summarize for you. <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=664" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  There are only 2 meds that I have found to work 100% of the time on mites and I have tried them all, not to mention I have tried to treat naturally with every solution recommended over the years. Unfortunately, I have never had Revolution work on mites as the stand alone treatment either (maybe the mites are resistant here kinda like frontline works in some areas on fleas but advantage does not?), but it doesn’t hurt to use revolution anyway to get rid of any other bugs that could be infesting your cat. <br>  <br>  Also... cheap over the counter ear drops from a pet store and natural treatments are not effective like vet treatments and must be continued daily for 6 weeks daily. A mites life cycle is 3 weeks and then you have to treat at least another 3 weeks for any mites that may have hatched after the initial 3 weeks treatment. Just save your cat any further suffering and see your vet for the good stuff. <br>  <br>  You are going to want to get Accarexx or Milbemite from your vet. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.idexx.com/animalhealth/pharmaceuticals/acarexx/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idexx.com/animalhealth/pharma...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.milbemite.novartis.us/about/en/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.milbemite.novartis.us/about/e...</a><br>  <br>  Either one of these will stop your cats suffering very quickly. You just squeeze one little tube in each ear, one time. They are both a one time treatment and VERY effective. I have used them both effectively many, many times without fail. Neither requires ear cleaning before. However if the ears are really bad and filled with mite poop gunk... cleaning them can kill the mites quicker, hence stopping the suffering of the cat faster. <br>  <br>  Please don't hesitate in the treatment of mites. It's painful and can cause deafness and other painful problems if left untreated. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you can get your kitty cured soon!
YzXuJOqUaa	I don't really know much about specific breeds but my tabby cat is very timid and runs away from people. He spends most of his life lurking under my bed!  I believe Siamese, Birmans and Persians enjoy a lot of attention but are quite demanding.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	I've heard that Ragdolls are very, very, mellow.  Just think about their name for a sec.   According the CFA breed profile: "Ragdolls are large, laid-back, semi longhaired cats with captivating blue eyes."   Go here:  http://www.cfa.org/breeds/profiles and click on the Ragdoll  profile.  You might also click on other breeds to see their profiles and maybe find another mellow breed.

AA11992723	you'll know soon....at 6 months is about when small and medium-small dogs stop growing. usually that's 25 lbs or under by 6 months.<br>   A dog who will be large, will probably weigh 25 lbs at 4 months lol. At 6 months, large breed dogs weigh about half of their adult weight.<br>  Those numbers are not concrete though, since yours is a mix, I'm just making guesses.<br>  It's hard to tell by the paws, since all puppies paws look big in proportion to the rest of them. <br>  Because yours is part lab, I wouldn't feed more than 27% protein in a kibble. The only reason to feed a large breed puppy specially formulated food for them, is so they do not grow fast, which will help their joints. So lower protein is fed for them, to slow their rapid growth.<br>   Innova is a good quality brand.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Where is the 'breeder' in all of this?  Every dog has to have had a breeder, who is the person you should be asking, unless you did the very thing everybody is trying to warn people from doing - bought from a pet shop?  And even a pet shop should have given you advice about what food to give your puppy, and how big (ie his parents?) he will be?<br>  <br>  At 9 weeks, just feed him a good quality puppy food and he'll be fine.  Frankly I think these so-called 'big breed' foods are a fad - and often have far too high a protein count in any case.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I would all depend on what he is mixed with.  If it's another large dog he could be large, if he is mixed with something smaller his growth may be short and he be small.<br>  <br>  My neighbors had a corgi german shepherd mix puppy, who had large paws as a puppy. The dog now full grown has the exact body of a corgi but the coloring and markings of a german shepherd, and the paws. Weighs in at about 30-40 pounds.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Well he will probably be a large dog considering he has lab in him. 12 lbs isn't that much.

MFZr5yhAaa	I dont think it would be that large of a problem. If anything and if the clawed frogs are big enough, they may eat the other fish. But the other cichlids may be too aggressive. I would try it out, put him in the tank, keep an eye on them and it's your call. If the fish/frog are too stressed and not eating I'd remove, same as if there just too much aggression.
iXijnCxOaa	Mutts...    Given the climate regarding BSL.. my suggestion is to call them Lab mixes.  With the "Marley & Me" furor, this should give them a leg up in the adoption ranking.  If you need to explain the extra color, I suppose you could say some relatively benign breed like "Boxer".    Both the blackmouth cur and the Ridgeback have negative connotations as far as temperament.  I saw no supposed "pit" in the photo you showed of the dam a while back - she's very much a generic medium sized mutt.    As far as size - these are running about the size of the average week old Samoyed... so my guess would be 40 -65 lbs .. with the dogs at the high end and the b*tches at the low end.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	I'd say Heinz 57 but that would be an insult to the people at Heinz.

4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Try this as a beginning - I learned it last year and it's done a world of good for me with my young horses-    You need to sensitize the horse to your commands - dropping of the head is the first step - the command training is all about pressure and release.  Teach it that a certain command is asking for a certain outcome, then build on that.    From a standstill - keep your body very relaxed so as not to communicate to the horse that you want it to move.  Lightly jiggle the reins - not back and forth and not see-sawing.  Just jiggle the reins to contact the horse's mouth.  He will seek to avoid the feeling or get you to stop jiggling somehow.  When he does this, he'll drop his head - it will take a good 5-10 minutes of jiggling.  When he does drop his head at all, immediately stop jiggling and praise him verbally as well as stroking his neck.  This tells him he did what you were looking for.  Then try again.  Keep doing this until when you jiggle, he drops his head right away.  I suggest maybe only 5-10 times the first session - too many times and he'll get bored of it.  Next session, start at the standstill, jiggle again and release and praise when he drops his head - then cue him to walk.  When his head is too high, jiggle until he drops, when he drops his head, stop jiggling and allow him to walk quietly straight or on the rail - not asking him to perform maneuvers.  You want him to focus on one thing at a time.   Work through a few sessions focusing some of your time on his keeping his head at the level you want it.  He will drop his head and keep it where he learns you want it.  For example, if the first few sessions get him to drop his head an inch, that's good but perhaps you wish him to drop his head 5 inches.  Build your cue up until he knows to drop his head until you stop jiggling.  Down - good, now go a little bit more, etc.    The dropping of the head to a natural headset will get him to collect and focus a whole lot more - because dropping his head narrows his range of vision, he's more focused than he is with head held high.  It will also allow him to engage his hind quarters more than will a high head set.    YOu can use artificial means, like draw reins, but they aren't teaching him to react to a cue - as soon as you leave off the draw reins, he'll not know what you wish and put his head where it's comfortable.    Hopefully this, perhaps with some other answers here from show people about how they achieve it will help.    This is much like gohorns... answer - the only difference is the angle of the reins.  You must be cautious, if you're using a leverage bit, pulling up could put more force on the bit - with a leverage bit, pulling back is putting on a lot of downward force on the tongue - pulling up doesn't change the cue a whole lot but can make it more acute.  The type of bit you're using will play a part and the force of your cue will as well.  Use only enough force to obtain the proper response and use a progressive range of force as needed - what you want is lightness in the cue - the end result should be the horse responding with the slightest touch of your hand on the reins, especially using a leverage bit.|`|Mbdr6dJ7aa	Um...If you ride western you could put a tie down on him to make his head where you want it.  Soon he will begin to just carry it that way w/o the tie down|`|AA10986942	Make sure you are using your legs to collect him and push him into your hands. Does he throw his head up when you ask him for contact? If so pick both of your hands straight up in the air (while keeping your leg pressure for forward movement) the idea is if he wants his head up there you will make it stay there. He will decide that is not such a comfortable place to be, wait him out... keep pushing forward and keep your hands / his head up, trust me he will finally get tired of the fight and will drop his head and neck into the bit like you want. This may take several minutes but if you drop your hands too soon you have just ruined the lesson. When you feel him start to drop hold him for a few more seconds so it is on your terms not his... After about a week of you doing this to him every time he throws his head in the air to avoid the bit contact he will be very happy to drop and bend at the poll when you ask. ( I am not saying to jerk the bit hard, just keep his head high with tiny unpredictable little jerky movements so that he cannot brace against them....) My trainer had me do this when I was taking lessons on my horse that she was training and at first he would not drop but she kept telling me to stay with it stay with it dont drop your hands! then when she saw him give up she waited a few more seconds then told me to drop my hands and push him onto the bit. It takes awhile and you think it is stupid but now I just pick up on my reins slightly , apply pressure with my legs and he drops his head which in turn if I have used my legs correctly he will be collected up and moving in frame.  Eventually you will just be able to bump with your legs to pick his back up and raise your hand slightly to bring his head into frame.|`|db9ce3362907a136acac0610fae4357eaa	Please make sure when you are askng for his head that you do not forget to keep him collected underneath.  If you loose the impulsion from behind, having his head down will be the least of your worries, as his movement will be uncollected and trashy.  When we teach our western horses to carry their hed down, we focus on a natural headset, not one that is forced.  Once we get the natural movement and teach them to move collected we work on the headset, you can always teach a headset, but fixing movement issues is much harder.  If he is fine at the walk, then move on to working at the trot.  Using a snffle bit,trot small circles asking him to flex his head to the inside and then to the outside, but remember to keep pushing him into the bit with your legs. When you are flexing his head bump with the inside rein and hold lightly with the outside rein, this will bring his nose to the side and in slightly.  Once he gives, switch to the other side.  Once he gives rather well in the circles, move him out straight still pushing him into the bit, anytime he gives release the pressure and then ask again if he lifts his head.  You can also work on two tracking him at the trot and asking for his head, this will keep the rear impulsion. Once he is giving in the circles and the two tracking, then you can begin to work on maintaining the headset on the straight aways.  Just lift up with both hands and hold until he gives his face, once he gives release.  If he puts his head backup, then ask again, he will figure out it is easier to just keep his head down.  Once you have this established, you can work on the headset at the lope, all you should have to do is pick up and hold till he gives, just remember to push him into the bit and never ask for his head with just your hands, eventually all you will have to do is push with your legs and he should drop his head and maintain a natural headset.|`|z3Ae5s1xaa	Try doing lots of lunging with a surcingle and side reins.  This is develop the muscles in his neck so he can flex better.  You seem to be asking him right, so maybe his muscles just can't move that way yet.|`|CgEjK7NGaa	I had the same problem with one of mine. Here's a very simple way to achieve this :         1) Gather your reins in one hand         2) Move your hand to the middle of his neck         3) Raise the reins in an upward motion, not a "pull back" motion.         4) When his nose tips down, immediately release.         5) Do this until he understands that the upward bumps mean to lower his head     Eventually, you will not have to exaggerate the motion so much....he will lower his head when you give a slight bump up on the reins.      Hope this helped! :)|`|5kUxkun3aa	working with draw reins will help to draw him into position.

The main thing is, do WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR DOG.|`|AA12128656	no one's bashing your dog.  the concern is that the people who breed those dogs don't do health testing, etc, so they might be breeding unhealthy animals.   there's a difference between a responsible breeder and a BYB.    p.s. did these pups have any shots when you got them? because for $250 the pups should have had 2 sets of pup shots and wormings|`|TSc8OE4vaa	It's because you are breeding mutts.  A poodle mix is a mutt, if you want one of those mutts so badly adopt one, don't pay for it.  They are unpredictable... it could be 50% poodle or 90% poodle or 1% poodle and it can still be called a poodle mix.    There are too many dogs in the world already.  Because you bought a dog instead of adopting one, a dog was killed in the shelter.  Congratulations, enjoy your mutt.|`|V2FuF8Gaaa	Nobody is bashing about your dog, so chill! The thing is that people are breeding two different breeds, to make money $ and it is not right!|`|n8jrLDblaa	People aren't bashing your dog, per se.    People are bashing you for supporting bad breeding practices.    And, if you were 'approved' to purchase a dog at 13, than that just proves our point.    EDIT: Shelters didn't approve you BECAUSE you're 13...which means you don't have a job, no money to support a dog or provide vet care, and a sup par sense of responsibility.|`|dwHnazEJaa	yes good for trying a shelter first!!|`|T8OFsBUUaa	They can be unpredictable in terms of how they develop, and what they might look like (seen some pretty funny mixes) and how their personalities are. For all these reasons, I would not personally pay over 2000 for one (which I have seen some breeders in the area charge.)    I also get really annoyed when filling out my sheets for my obedience classes, when I write down the breed as say "Lab-Poodle X" rather than the "Labradoodle" moniker, and the owners get mad at me. It isn't a Labradoodle. It's a Lab-Poodle X.     But obviously there is a market for them. And if people are happy with the them, and understand the risks to owning a cross-breed (The same they should be when owning a pure-bred) and if they want to pay ridiculous amounts for them, then who am I to say it's wrong? They can be a nightmare, but they can also been lovely, adoring pets. I've seen both ends of the spectrum.    EDIT: And shelter dogs are not for everyone - so don't judge. Shelter dogs can be difficult and come with baggage, which is why ownership of such a dog can be rewarding. I often recommend that a first time dog owner try for a puppy, rather than having to deal with problems that may be beyond their ability as dog owners, like severe aggression, separation anxiety, or whatever|`|nPuZVGFRaa	I'm also 13 and I have a poodle/shih tzu and she just had pups :)  I got her from a lady's house and she had lots of dog's that had puppies.  Why are poodle mixes a disaster!? Geez, People these days.  ha ha.  My poodle mix has won 13 gold medals at competitions and is very smart.  She has won 3 medals for her dancing, 2 for her behavior, 5 for her looks, and 3 for her flips.  Does that sound like a bad poodle!?  NO!  Ha ha.|`|OCHM0Q7paa	Who cares if you didn't get it from a shelter if it has a good home. (i got mine at the pound though, lab/mix)|`|oRr9SOIqaa	They are not a disaster!

At my local humane society you have to be at least 21 to adopt! You supported a horrible practice and let the "greeders" win again! Do you expect us to say "oh, she's only 13, she has every right to purchase a worthless dog..."? You're not going to hear that. I have 4 purebreds-3 were from rescues and  I was on a 3 year wait list for my japanese chin. Do you know how many poodle mixes were in those rescues? I have nothing against mutts. I grew up with rescued mutts, and my parents will always have at least one mutt. What makes me sick is people who support ignorant people who mix 2 dogs to make something cute and trendy that will just end up in the humane society.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I think people get the hump more about the breeders making ridiculous amounts of money from crossbreeding dogs and passing them off as 'designer dogs' as though they are something special and desirable to own. When I was young two known breeds allowed to produce a litter had a litter of '1st generation cross-breeds' and they would be practically given away. With increased awareness that unselective breeding leads to large numbers of dogs being dumped a crossbreed dog did become quite hard to find until someone latched onto the 'designer dog'. Now we are back to square one with lots of people irresponsibly breeding their dogs again. I'm not knocking you owning a dog and I'm sure that you love your dog and will always do the best for her, but think on this.. in Cyprus there is a strain of dog known as the 'cyprus poodle'. This is a cross between a poodle and a terrier, they are over-run with them, the shelters are full of them and they are seen as nothing special... just another crossbred dog. I hope this makes things a bit clearer why people get so mad about poodle crosses.  PS Ive got nothing against them, my rescued terrier x is crossed with a poodle!|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	I am for shelters. However, there is nothing wrong going to a breeder for a dog. Especially certain types and especially when you want a specific temperament/ personality. I did not get a doberman from the shelter due to the type of dog I want. However, my first dog was from the shelter.  People are going to breed dogs wither people on yahoo believes it to be wrong. There is nothing wrong with breeding dogs no matter the breed. Some do it to improve the dogs next generation health. Its puppy mills that are wrong. Dogs are going to need a home regardless of how they were born. If you want to pay for your dog, that is your business. What you pay for is knowing the pedigree of the dog. Be proud of your dog and proud at the fact that you understand responsibility more than a good portion of adults. BTW certain breeds that we have now were created from cross breeding what makes the poodle any different? Time people start reading on the orgins of their dogs.|`|S5Lz35myaa	Thank you for at least trying a shelter first.  Many folks are not against mixed breed dogs, just against the breeders who unscrupulously intentionally mix two dogs, give them a fancy name, and an even higher price tag.  Shelters are full of dogs who are destroyed every day, which is why many folks will say to try them first.  That does not mean other dogs who are not from shelters are bad dogs.|`|q28VSNueaa	First of all congratulations on your new puppy.  You were most likely turned down at the shelter because of your age.    I think what people get angry about when you talk about Designer Dogs is that backyard breeders are breeding what is nothing more than a mixed breed dog aka "mutt" and calling them "Designer Dogs" and then making huge profits from them.  I myself refuse to line the pockets of these type breeders but I guess in all reality it is a personal choice.  What angers people including myself is the type of person you bought this dog from is one who could care less about the animal and is only concerned about making money.  This in turn creates animals with birth defects or just plain unhealthy from the living conditions these dogs are forced to live in and animals that end up destroyed in shelters, etc.      As long as you are happy with your dog, that is all that matters and while every person has an opinion, the only one that really matters in this case is yours.  So enjoy your puppy and take good care of it.  Give it lots of love and it will give you lots of joy regardless of where it came from.|`|z72pNcCpaa	People are probably bashing you because most purebred dog's aren't really treated good when they're being bred .  Most puppies from pet stores are bred at 'Puppy Mills', where the mothers are squished into small cages that they can hardly move inside , let alone give birth . These animals get diseases and usually almost starve to death .  It's great that checked out the shelter first , and it's okay that none of the dogs appealed to you . It sounds like you are your dog get along great and that's okay .   Just try to make sure you know where your dogs come from before you buy them . You don't want these horrible Puppy Mills getting any more money to buy more animals to torture ?|`|S2ZccVFAaa	we have a family mutt and i just love her. she's a bichon/shih-tzu mix and she is the coolest dog ever. she lives with my mom but when i go over she lets me know if she mad. it's too funny...she will bark and bark if you don't pay attention to her. one thing shes loves is for me to pick her up and just hold her. she actually falls asleep within a few minutes. i call her "princess whitney" because she thinks she rules the house and pretty much does. have fun w/ your doggie

Make sure that you have a large tank if you intend to get one of these, as they do get pretty big. The best places to try would be Aquahome in Leyland or Pier aquatics in Wigan. Failing that CMC aquatics (just a short distace from Pier aquatics as a matter of fact) may be worth a look.

XI2iylR4aa	First of all, make sure you wear gloves and a face mask when you handle a sick rock.  They can easily transfer their colds to you, and you'll be sneezing pebbles for weeks.  It's not pretty.    You should give him a warm bath, preferably with a few drops of peppermint oil to help clear him up.    Put him in bed, in a sock pulled up to his chin, like a little sleeping bag.  If Alan is too big to fit in a sock, you can use a flannel pillowcase.       Make sure he has plenty of fluids and give him a 100mg vitamin c every six hours.    Good luck, I hope Alan is ok.|`|4uQkjcRBaa	You should tuck him in every night...and give him nice warm baths regularly.

rwYL9H8Uaa	You mouse probably had a seizure. Symptoms often include sudden fit like the one you just described. If you take her to the vet they may prescribe a steroid for her. Soy, cured meats, and fatty foods can trigger seizures. Estrogen can also cause seizures. When she is having a fit they best thing you can do if keep her still, and give her a safe living environment so she won't hurt herself. Mice are so cute, and good luck!|`|uzQgWLZnaa	Could just be old age taking its toll, or just a nerve twitching badly|`|yL0dzxqIaa	when she is having it get her and stroke her and try to calm her down or take of to the vets i am a vet trust me   it might just be a old age thing|`|b5o5AIt1aa	i had two mum guinea pigs and 6 babies  in 2months, it went down to one mum and two babies  they all died the way you described your mouse, they all had diarrhoea before it though, i managed to save my little albino Ruby , sadly not her sister or her mum , she lives with the aunt now.    go to the VET !

It does sound like seizures though. There's nothing we can do to help - phone a vet and see if there's anything they can do for the mouse. I must say if she keeps doing it it may well mean she's on her way out and you may want to consider euthanasia rather than see her going on and on like this.    Chalice
45N6tmWraa	No, not normal.  You will want to call the veterinarian to discuss this without delay.  Drontal usually causes no ill effects.
SzGyWKsPaa	1. I would recommend your sister has limited contact with the gerbil until she gets better. I'm not sure if the gerbil can get sick, but I don't think that it's worth the risk. If she'd like to hold the gerbil, tell her to wash her hands thoroughly before and after. I've been sick and still have to handle my gerbils because I'm the one who cares for them. They've been fine, but I make sure I wash my hands.<br>  <br>  2. Two to three inches of bedding isn't much. When you're still taming her, I'd say that is fine, but gerbils are much happier with tons of bedding. I would say 7-8 inches would be pretty good. Yes, that's a lot of bedding, but they're big diggers.<br>  <br>  3. This digging is normal, but can be caused by lack of bedding to dig in. Try adding more bedding to see if it solves the problems. My girls used to dig like crazy against the glass of their tank until I added tons of bedding for them to dig in.<br>  <br>  4. There are a few ways you can pick up your gerbil. The first is to corner her into a toilet paper tube. Put your hands over both ends, then open up one and put her into your hand. The second is to use a cup of some sort. Get her to go into it, then "pour" her into your hand. You can kind of push her into a corner of her cage and use your hands to "scoop" her up. When she's sitting up on her hind legs, you can use one hand to scoop her up from under her belly. It'll just take time and practice to find a comfortable way of picking her up. It takes time for the treat thing to work. Just start by gaining her trust.<br>  <br>  5. Is it biting and drawing blood or just nibbling? If it's just nibbling, it's normal. She might just think your food. She's just testing to see if you're edible or not. When she does this, blow a gentle puff of air in her face and firmly say "no". If she's drawing blood, it could be aggression. Just be sure to wash your hands so you don't smell like food, and blow a puff of air in her face if she bites.<br>  <br>  6. Small amounts of lettuce are alright. Feeding large amounts can cause liver problems. As for five fruits and five vegetables:<br>  <br>  Fruits<br>  -apple (no seeds)<br>  -berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)<br>  -grapes<br>  -peaches<br>  -one sac of juice from an orange<br>  <br>  Vegetables<br>  -broccoli<br>  -carrot<br>  -cucumber<br>  -celery<br>  -peas|`|NVx3iRZJaa	1) Yes, I think it should be fine. Most animals can't catch human diseases, but to be on the safe side maybe you should tell your sister that she can pet her when she's all better. Then you'll know for sure your gerbil won't get sick, and your little sister will have something to look forward to when she gets better, which is nice.<br>  <br>  2)The more bedding the better (in this case). Gerbils make tunnels and burrows in the wild, and it's only their natural instinct to want to try to make those burrows. It's usually why most people keep them in tanks. But yeah, add more bedding. If she keeps scratching at the bottom that hard, then she could hurt her paws.<br>  <br>  3) As said in my answer for # 2 above, it's just natural. It won't hurt her to scrape the sides of the igloo, I have one for my hamster and he scrapes it too. Like you said, she's just trying to make another 'burrow' in her cage like she would if she weren't domestic.<br>  <br>  4) I used to have two dwarf hamsters which are some of the fighstiest little buggers you'll ever see. Basically I put on a thick gardening glove, and let them crawl into it. They sit in the middle of it and chew and nip and bite for like an hour, then they'd settle down and start to walk around the glove. After a month or so, I could hold them on my bare hand without them biting. They were so adorable, I really miss them. Do the same thing with your gerbil. Cut up some fresh veggies or fruits and place them in your glove, and see if she/he eats off it.<br>  <br>  <br>  5)No, she's not being aggresive. Think about her transition from the pet store (or wherever you got her from), to a brand new cage in a brand new house with brand new people and brand new smells. It's stressful for animals and she probably doesn't quite understand yet, but she will in time. It might take acouple of bites for her to get used to you. Instead of putting your finger near her and letting her sniff you, put your hand as far away in from her as possible. Make sure your hands don't smell of food, by washing them. Then let's say she's in the back corner of the cage/tank. Just put your hand in the cage as far away as possible. This way, you're not invading her 'personal bubble', and she won't feel as much need to defend herself. It mgiht take acouple of tries for her to come sniff your hand, and she may still bite it but that's normal. After awhile, she won't nip.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) Fruit and vegetables that are safe to feed a gerbil are:<br>  <br>  Apple (seedless) <br>  Broccoli <br>  Carrots <br>  Cauliflower leaves and stalks <br>  Cucumber <br>  Lettuce - small amounts occasionally - in excess it can cause liver problems <br>  Parsley - a good tonic <br>  Fruit and vegetables that should not be fed are:<br>  <br>  Kidney Beans (raw) <br>  Onion <br>  Potato (raw) <br>  Potato tops <br>  Rhubarb (raw) <br>  Rhubarb leaves <br>  Tomato leaves <br>  <br>  If you need to know more, here's the site : <br>  <a href="http://www.petwebsite.com/gerbils/gerbil_fruit.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwebsite.com/gerbils/gerbil...</a><br>  <br>  Just copy and paste that into your browser (the white bar that you type sites into, if you don't know what that is)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|79RPJh1Kaa	your funny|`|0uMXpQLqaa	why don't you just go and eat some cheese|`|LIxpXTnLaa	do you really thing 'please' is spelled that way?|`|xCvOSzpJaa	1) I think your Gerbil will be ok, try to keep him or her out of drafts just in case!<br>  <br>  2) Yes, that's fine. Gerbils like to dig alot. So you might want to get a big pot and put ripped up newspaper (I'm not sure if you can use dirt) in, and sometimes, (when shes good) put her in it and let her dig!<br>  <br>  3) First of all, gerbils can't see very well, and also she might just like to scratch it! Like sometimes, even if you put a Billion chew toys in a hamsters cage, they may still prefer to chew the bars of the cage!<br>  <br>  4) Fist, just let your gerbil get used to used to you. A way to help with that is to scoop her up with a cup (don't hurt her when you do this!)<br>  and then sit in the bath tub with her, and let her get to know your sent! After about a week, try the treat thing again!<br>  <br>  5) She only bites,  because she is still trying to get to know you. You might need the wear gloves until she knows you better.<br>  <br>  6) Strawberries<br>      Carrots<br>      Apple<br>      Peanuts (unsalted)<br>      Cereal (Not the sweetened kind)<br>       Peas<br>       <br>  <br>  <br>    Hope I helped!<br>  <br>    Ry*~*|`|qTQ0l1vBaa	yes he will be fine<br>  fruits<br>  1.apple                              veggies<br>                                           1.carrot<br>                                           2.lettuce<br>                                           3.brocolli<br>                                           4.spinach<br>                                           5.cailiflower                                 2.orange<br>  3.mango<br>  4.kiwi<br>  5.rasberry<br>  6.lemons with some sugar|`|BSvcsahoaa	if ur sister is sick your gerbils will be ok but to be on the safe side keep her away for a day or two. <br>  <br>  you have plenty of bedding my gerbil does the same.<br>  <br>  i find it hard to catch my gerbil so scoop her up with both your hand (from her feet)<br>  <br>  my gerbils also bites my fingers after a while she'll get used to you petting her.<br>  <br>  romaine lettuce is fine good job for not giving her iceburg they get no goodness out of that.<br>  <br>  hope this helps good luck|`|ZKbqB8Noaa	1.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	A cat doesn't hiss and growl for no reason.  Spraying him with water when he has an obvious problem is not a solution.  My cat got really grumpy and started hissing and growling all the time so I took him to the vet.  Turns out he was in kidney failure and in pain.  With treatment he has become a sweetie again. I'd have Bobby checked out and if he comes out clear of illness, work on what could be stressing him.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	He does not hiss and growl "for no reason".

It's no use doing it minutes later when the cat doesn't realise what he's being punished for. He has to associate the unpleasant spray of water with whatever he's doing at the time. And get him neutered, if he hasn't been already, then he won't act so alpha-male around you.<br>  <br>  Poker - Spray vinegar at a cats eyes and you risk blinding the animal. Try spraying it in your own eyes if you don't believe me.|`|1Cnaphybaa	as long as you dont spray alot and only on his body.dont perform animal cruelty.please.im not suggesting you are cruel to animals im just sending out the message.go to the vet and get him checked out.this is not normal cats behaviour.|`|6XRJT6Xbaa	Vinegar works a lot better. I know it sounds harsh but its really not and they smell it better which gives them more of a awakening that they are being punished.|`|gndS3jslaa	Assuming you're cat wasn't always spitting and growling at you, I'd suggest you take your cat to the vet. Cats do not growl and hiss for no reason. They don't have the ability to tell us what's wrong. They act out. It could be anything from upset tummy or UTI or something more serious. Spraying him with water isn't going to correct the problem. Talk the cat's doctor.
AA11097657	Why would a toe snap off?     Do you mean a nail or claw?    If it is a claw then no, it won't bleed to death.    If it is a toe that has broken off then a vet is needed.    EDIT -   I now see you have added toe. This has happened due to an infection in the bone of the toe. It has died and literally dropped off. Your dog needs antibiotics and the hole repairing and bandaging. It needs to be a main artery to bleed to death. There isn't one in the toe joint. Get to the vets as soon as you can. More infection will lose more bones.|`|Ao3axy36aa	yes, if the bleeding isn't stopped right away.|`|S5Lz35myaa	If the toe snaps off?  If you truly mean "toe", get that dog a vet.

AA11244754	I highly doubt a vet is going to be interviewed via email just look up 2 vets in your city or town call and explain to the receptionist that answers you would like to schedule an appt. with a vet so that you can go there and interview them.

Good luck|`|40IUKsC2aa	get the litter box that she uses.if there are droppings in there leave them there.if there is none then put some in there.so she could smell it and know that is the bathroom.or you could easily tell when a ferret is going to the bath room because they back up to a corner so just pick her up when you see her backing up and place her in the litter box.she will soon get the idea that she needs to go in the litter box.you should also give her a treat every time she goes in the litter box and not on the floor/corner.

They should have a list of breeders and even ads for breeding.|`|9ZHJCSnTaa	Breeding is wrong! There are enough homeless animals in shelters right now for you to purposely make more!!|`|AA11244754	If you don't know get your dog fixed.  Leave it to the professionals because it's thanks to people like you who don't know what they are doing when they decide on a wild hair "golly gee, I think I will make some money and breed my dog" that is the reason that shelters are full of unwanted puppies and dogs.  Also it costs more money than you make when you truly care about your dog enough to take her to prenatal vet visits, getting an ultra-sound, taking the new mother and pups to the vet the day after she gives birth (and that is if she doesn't run into complications and have to have medical intervention anywhere from just a shot to help get the labor going again to a c-section), to help her produce enough milk for all the puppies as well as the vet checking the puppies to make sure that they are going well after being born, getting them their first puppy shots and worming.  So before go off half cocked and "breed" your dog do some research on your own and educate yourself before she ends up in the family way and get her spayed.|`|f7bcycfgaa	you can out an ad in the paper or something|`|X3bu0B8faa	I guess the question is, has your dog proven itself to be up to breed standard? have you taken her in for all testing? Holter, CERF, xrays etc? Do you have a waiting list for the puppies that you have researched and made sure they will have safe homes? Are you prepared to spend the money it will take to make sure the puppies are healthy before they leave your home? Responsible breeders don't make money, and they don't do it because puppies are cute- They do it to better the breed, and they love their dogs. If you want a new puppy, please go to a shelter and save one, or find a reputable breeder through AKC or UKC to purchase one. Millers are just not acceptable and not tolerated anymore. Do the right thing if you aren't showing your girl- Spay. No infections, no cancer, no males hanging around waiting for their chance. I know you will make the right decision.

nugOKrqaaa	if the male is just a little larger say a few 3-4 pounds thier is no cause for alarm. what they are talking about is mating a small breed rabbit to a large breed...for example a dutch rabbit to a new zealand. a 10 pound difference.to confirm pregnacy try palpating the doe[female] in a coupe of weeks.palpating is rubbing your hand on the belly..if theres babys thier you will feel them as little lumps. the best way to breed them to insure a good litter is to put the doe[female] in the bucks [male] cage in the morning.let him mount her and grunt and fall off of her 3 times.then put her back in her own cage. then in the evening do the same process again.do not do this several days apart, as the doe may end up have 2 litters 1-2 weeks apart and she will not be able to care for 1 or both litters|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	Breeding any kind of animal is a huge responsibilty, there are many complications and risks to breeding rabbits. Are you sure it is worth risking the lives of your rabbits?    If the buck is bigger than the doe then yes it is possible the babies will be too big when born and kill your doe.    If you do breed them (and I dont think you should) then you must let them be together for an hour at the most, you MUST watch them, as soon as they have mated you need to seperate them until the babies are born. If you put them back together even for a few minutes and they mate again then the rabbit will get pregnant twice as rabbits have 2 ovaries. If this happens not only will babies die but so will your rabbit.    Please dont breed your rabbits, there really is no need, the doe will be at risk from cancer and her personality will change once bred and if you breed them they probably wont be able to socialise together.    Also if you anyone who is asking basic questions about breeding on YAHOO ANSWERS should not breeding, there are plenty of websites that would tell you these basic things and you could get incorrect information about breeding by people who know nothing about rabbits.    Enjoy your rabbits you have.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Hi, I think it's great that you want to get your rabbits neutered.  Before you decide to breed rabbits, please check out this site:    http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/breeding.h...    Even allowing them to breed "just once" contributes to the unwanted rabbit problem.|`|oGVWdnHraa	If the male is noticably bigger than the female, there is a good chance there will be complications (ie. kits being stuck or born prematurely because they are too big to stay in the womb). The doe could also most definatly die during or after giving birth to large kits. If you are intending on breeding again, you should not do so within 8 months of kindling (birth) of the first litter as the doe needs time to recover before she will be able to give birth to a HEALTHY litter. Also, the first litter, for most does, dies because they are inexperienced and do not know how to care for them. You are better off spaying and neutering your animals as there is a lot of risk involved with breeding, and also there are already many homeless rabbits about, just have a look at pet finder   http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...   and thats just in one area!

When my Collie was diagnosed years ago, there wasn't much choice but to put him down. I have even heard people at the dog show talking about using Hyalun which is a horse supplement, but I now see it in some dog supplements. Try a few and see which works best- Be careful of aspirin because it can cause tummy trouble and bleeding. Use under a Vet only. Glucosamine and Chondroitin are two popular ones, its the inflammation that causes the pain, so if you can get that under control you've got it aced. Good Luck!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	These are questions you really need to ask your vet. It depends on the cause and severity of the arthritis, and the factors that may be exacerbating it.    There are several things your vet can do for you to help your dog. Anti inflammatories will ease her pain marvellously, supplements and diet can also help by preventing the problem from getting worse. If the dog has any extra weight (ask your vet) this must come off!    Please talk this through with the diagnosing vet.    Chalice    EDIT: Please do NOT follow Jennifer R's advice, she has no business suggesting 'treatment' for a dog she knows nothing about, even if she was a vet. And this is NOT the way to treat arthritis in dogs.
46Mxaw13aa	u can feed them feeder roaches but they are hard to come by u can buy them online. If they are babies u can feed them some gerber baby food but take it out after 4 hours so it doesn't spoil. They also can eat a pinky mice when they reach full size but it MUST be done sparingly usually like once every couple of months is ok the reason why its bad is cuz leopard geckos aren't meant to digest bones and it also could be a choking hazard many leopard gecko breeders will give the gravid (preganant) females a pinky mouse for added protein|`|HS44HUrgaa	that's really it, maybe you can give it a dish with calcium powder ndd put the mealworms in that so when he eats them he will get extra calcium|`|xoXkHOVsaa	There are small varieties of feeder roaches that they will eat.  An adult gecko can eat a pinkie mouse, but don't do this very often pinkies are a big meal.  Usually they are just fed to pregnant females.  I have heard of geckos that will eat a small amount of citrus fruit, mine didn't touch it though.    The easiest foods to find are crickets and worms.  They will be very happy with those, so don't feel like you have to provide a huge variety for them.|`|pf21XfB7aa	Roaches, locust, silkworms, phoenix worms and full grow leopard gecko can eat pinkies.

They're very aggressive. My experiences with them are that they tend to tear apart any other fish in the tank and sometimes even pick fights with other puffers. I definitely do NOT recommend housing puffers with your tiger barbs and pleco. <br>  <br>  I would stick with other semi-aggressive tropical community fish with your barbs and pleco. If you're interested in puffers, set up a tank specifically for puffers. But in my opinion, a tropical community would make for a more interesting aquarium.

AA10229248	Rescue Remedy has a very short half life. It's only in the dog's bloodstream for 20 minutes or so. So it's great to help calm a dog before a storm or a dog that has had a seizure and is in the post ictal phase. But beyond that it isn't much help; particularly in a situation where the dog is reactive towards other dogs.<br>  <br>  Rescue Remedy also has a high alcohol content, which probably contributes to its effectiveness, so some dogs do not tolerate it as well as others. Also it can interfere with other medications the dog may be on.<br>  <br>  I keep RR on hand for my seizure dog and it does help some with his post ictal phase. I also give it to any new foster dogs that come into the house. Other than that, the only use I've found for it is if I've had a particularly crappy day at work and I'm feeling a little stressed I may take some. I can't say for certain whether it works or if its just a placebo effect, though.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I know some people swear by RR, but my view of this is you might as well give them a slug of brandy!!  I've used this myself on occasion but personally I'd rather enjoy the brandy lol.<br>  <br>  I just don't like the idea of 'drugging' up my dogs all the time, and it's absolutely no substitute for training, although it might have a calming effect for thunderstorms or situations like moving house - in other words, for a one-off situation.<br>  <br>  I tend to treat these hyper problems from a diet point of view (training apart).  And I've found getting a low protein (around 18% max) product has better results.  Puppies apart!  And of course, it might have absolutely no benefit for a high-energy animal like anything with Border Collie in them.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Wow,one would think that you'd know TRAINING is better than DRUGGING an animal.....seein' as you're a TC & all.<br>  <br>  Anybody would think that you'd know how to keep an untrained undisciplined bully ON-LEAD instead of allowing it to terrorize other people's animals.<br>  <br>  Would expect a TC to accept responsibility & work w/their dog instead of looking for magic wands,voodoo & drugs.<br>  <br>  my my.........interesting....|`|ISAuCHNDaa	Rescue Remedy is something that all of the specialists we have seen recommend for our dog when she is nervous or anxious.  I am sure that a few drops on his tongue would help to feel less inclined to behave in that way.|`|iXijnCxOaa	My general thoughts echo Dead Games.  Train the dog.  Don't let him get away with making decisions (isn't that what YOU are supposed to do?).  <br>  <br>  I equate rescue remedy as something akin to putting alcohol in a baby's bottle to make it calm and sleepy.  Deal with the issue... if the kid is crying, there is a reason ~ if there isn't a reason the kid needs to learn crying won't get him anything.<br>  <br>  If this was my dog the FUN would end the MOMENT I saw any sort of correcting/policing behavior... EVERY * SINGLE * TIME.   I don't allow dogs to make those sorts of decisions.<br>  <br>  I watched a friend accidentally ingest a half ounce bottle of RR that she was holding in her teeth while using the dropper on her dog ~ the dog jumped and knocked her chin, she swallowed the contents of the bottle.  She was dazed, confused and drugged... as well as asleep for 6 hours about 30 minutes after ingestion.  That was enough for me to say "never"... of course, I'm pro-"train the danged dog" anyhow.
iVQULHqYaa	He is beautiful. You could sit your daughter in her stroller and do some training with him in the yard. You are right Intelligent dogs need a challenge. Perhaps going to training classes on a regular basis might be difficult, however if you just went to a few it would teach you the basics. There are some heel work to music exercises which are very easy and you can reward your dog with a treat or a toy. For now if you can teach him to fetch it will help.<br>  HOW TO TEACH YOUR DOG TO FETCH/RETRIEVE.<br>  <br>  The ideal location for this is a hall, narrow passage or the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Prepare some treats, hopefully not just dried dog food. You will also need a toy or a ball; if it’s a big dog don’t use a small ball as he could swallow it.<br>  <br>  Stand at the end of the hall or room and wind your dog up by throwing whatever object that you have decided to use, into the air and catch it yourself. Make excitable noises, then throw the object.<br>  If your dog does not know how to fetch/retrieve don’t try to tempt him to do so. Your dog will probably pick up the object and take it to the corner of the room, or under a chair or a table. Go to your dog with a treat in your hand and your dog will drop the object in favour of the treat.<br>  <br>  ***Wind your dog up again with the object, get him excited and return to the place where you first threw the object from and throw it again. Your dog will pick up the object and then take it to the same place which he took it to the first time.  Again offer a treat and he will give the object up.***<br>  <br>  Repeat from ***to *** about eight times, however if he looses interest stop and start again the next day. If he is still keen throw the object from the place where he has habitually taken it and he will return there with the object. Show him a treat, exchange this for the object and throw a handful of treats onto the floor. End this exercise and do it again tomorrow. Eventually you can progress to the garden/yard.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10526402	He's so cute!  I got my dog some puzzle toys, some of them had treats inside and some had other little toys inside that she had to try to get at...she of course preferred playing with the ones that had treats in it!

9kceDOTraa	When someone says the water is soft, and there is no listed reading, you need to take this with caution, because just saying soft with no reading can be misleading, as that's just a relative term.  They should give you both a GH and KH reading.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, without listing your species, not every single African as well need the higher pH and hardness too.  Many Riverine types such as Jewels and Kribensis don't typically dwell in the conditions in the rift lakes, so species is important.<br>  <br>  In general, you get better growth and coloration out of Africans kept in proper conditions, but as long as it's not extremely out of range, it shouldn't be an issue.  You can just as easily boost your GH and KH with many suppliments, and you are not limited to just crushed coral either.  There are a number of buffer salts that you can add via water changes, argonite, as well as simple baking soda.  Again though, this does depend somewhat on what species you have too.|`|00RgkZF8aa	The pH is ok, but the hardness isn't. African Cichlids need hard water.<br>  <br>  Try putting some crushed coral in your filter to harden the water.|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	A PH of 8 should be fine. 7 is the PH of pure water... but fish cannot survive above 11.|`|MJbXxrjXaa	Just get some "Proper PH 7.0" and put it in the tank as needed
0ef3O2m6aa	I have to say I do think it is a bit gender related.  Girls are calmer and like to cuddle, boys are rough tuff and tumble.  Boys are inquisitive and like to see what will happens.  They are more amused at things such as this.  Boys are physical and girls are emotional this is directly related to how they play.  This is not to say, it is not the fault of the parent!  We as parents need to teach and guide our children in proper behaviour and treatment of animals.  I do think it comes more easily to girls given the more coddly natural of the female.  But boys can be taught as well.  Watch how adults interact with their dogs.  Women snuggle and like the dog to sit calmly beside or on their laps.  Men like to play slap on the head etc to get the dog growling and playing rough, biting arms and full out wrestling.  <br>  <br>  So to answer your question empathy comes naturally for a girl, that is proven fact.  Boys take awhile to learn empathy.  And yes, girls are calmer and overall less active than boys usually.  BUT I have seen boys that are excellent with animals and girls that can't resist getting in a dogs face or pulling a tail!|`|cnZlMojUaa	Interesting question. I feel the primary responsibility rests on the way parents teach young children to treat and respect animals.<br>  <br>  But, typically, there is a difference in the way little girls and little boys play. Girls tend to have cuddly toys like dolls and stuffed animals. They will baby and "mother" these toys and therefore play more gently. Boys may have trucks to crash and action figures to play superheroes with and this is more active play. I do I think little girls can push an animal too far if they treat it like a stuffed toy, try to dress it up and drag it around by the legs, so both boys and girls can be bitten. Children need to be taught respect for animals. As we all know from posts on this board, not all adults have respect for animals, so some children are at a disadvantage from the start. What really scares me is that it's been documented that sociopathic behavior frequently begins in childhood with cruelty to animals.<br>  <br>  I know the thread you are talking about. I feel sad for both the dog and the toddler in this case. I don't have kids, but heavens, I know that children need discipline and guidance.|`|PM23RDycaa	Boys are generally rougher but it doesn't mean girls can't be for example me, many male cousins so I played liked they did. With each though not our pets. we were all taught to respect animals and what was and wasn't proper behavior and I have done so with my own son who is two.<br>  <br>  His only bad habit is feeding his father's cats scraps when he's over there on the weekends.<br>  <br>  Gender aside its all in the parents. Should a dog be aggressive with humans? No, but an animal will only take so much abuse before saying enough is enough. Its not just little kids though I have seen older kids with NO respect for animals,my neighbors kids. They were just a bit older than me so like 14-16 and threw eggs at our young rott female. she managed to jump our 5 '2 tall cinder block fence and chased them down the street.<br>  <br>  She then came home and waited to be let back in the front gate. What was messed up about this situation was that they had two rotts of their own but their dogs were the prime reason why people still are distrustful of the breed.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Girls are worse....my dogs are terrified of little girls.   Because they have that high pitched squeal when they see a dog and then they run up and try to hug on it and smother it.    Little girls are way worse<br>  <br>  We avoid all little girls like the plague...but little boys tend to be able to ask to pet the dog and be gentlier.<br>  <br>  But then again we never let any child pet our dogs without asking<br>  <br>  I trust my dogs not strangers kids.....|`|yVlYuxPVaa	Well, that is how my female dog is. She HATES men. At the vet she started barking with the male and showed him her teeth. ever since then they put a muzzle on her, but with women, she will greet them and like them. I guess it is in her blood.<br>  <br>  Ps: She is a rottweiler|`|T864ejaiaa	i have meet both genders that do that to dogs. i think it just depends if the child loves animals and wants to cuddle it. my grand daughter would pick up her moms cat and hole it up to her face and rub it against her face. she would say soft and ohhh.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I don't think it has anything to do with gender, it is the parents fault for not teaching the child how to act with the puppy. The first mistake they make is getting a pup before the child is ready for it.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Interesting question!  My own experience almost matches what you've posted.  I've seen a baby rabbit killed by a little boy who was "afraid of him" (and mom saw nothing unusual about this), a kitten who was squeezed so hard by a little boy that he was seizuring (he recovered and went to a new home), and a few other small pets hurt by young boys.  I did see a small dog who was thrown off the owner's bed by their daughter and consequently suffered a broken leg, but the majority of cases involved boys.  Whether that's nature or nurture, I'm honestly not sure.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Boys generaly have a more 'rough and tumble' nature to them, however, I don't believe it's a gender issue.  I believe that chldren in general are cruel because they do not know any better.  Children have to be taught kindness, gentleness,  and compassion the same way we have to teach puppies not to bite.|`|2HuuSi3Maa	i think that's just how it happens to fall as i have grown up i have been far from what you would classify as a girly girl but i never have been aggressive with animals but a lot of my friends as they where growing up used to be.  My one friend when she was very young used to love pulling the cats tail.So i think its just based on the attitude of the child nothing else.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It is well documented that the most common bite victims are young boys - who do often play rougher and are more likely to tease a dog.  Boys will be boys - but that's not to say a toddler girl couldn't do the same thing - my niece had to be watched very carefully because she tended to play very rough when she was young.|`|XavY3fiWaa	I don't really know if it has to do with gender,thats an interesting question i never really thought of it before.  But boys do play rougher and like to tease dogs, especially little dogs.  But it mostly depends on how well the parents taught them to behave around animals.|`|tsnpv9whaa	Boys usually do play rougher at most things! Yea the parents can teach them to play nicer but girls can be the same way! Most little girls have different interests than boys. Your typical little boy is more likely to tease or play rough with a dog!
PqT6pQAoaa	Definitely! As long as they have a friend, then they are ok. Yes it is true that they like big groups because then they are more active and lively. But I would recommend at least 3 for them to be "lively"<br>  <br>  Good luck :D|`|t85b6QMiaa	Corydoras of all varieties like nothing better than to commune with other family members. Therefore, I'd say it is okay if you keep them either in pair or in larger number.  Naturally, they are also close to each other although they may not form a close shoal such as the Neon Tetra and such. And as many other shoaling fish, they are more happy in larger number.<br>  <br>  I love them because they are really cute and goes well with many other tropical species. They are also active in broad daylight compare to other bottom feeders which generally active at dusk. Solitary corydora also may not develop an aggressive personality compare to other species. A real prince if I might say.<br>  <br>  They are also a hardy type which do well in many water composition. However, they may not stand up for themselves should you house them with intolerant or aggressive species.|`|NuSFGFtOaa	Non schooling would be guppies,mollies (pairs) and alot of cyprinids.the minimum for coris is 3 but they normally arent too happy with less than 6 in a group!
IMPvzBk1aa	You might find this article interesting.  Note that the largest majority of horses at auction for slaughter in this example were riding horses.<br>  I tend not to want the government involved in things any more than is necessary, since it doesn't always produce the desired results.  I'm wondering what the requirements would be to qualify someone to be licensed?  I wish the study I'm posting had gone further and determined where the riding horses were bred, which would be pertinent to your question.  Oh well.........................<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=7074" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, since this article was printed, all horse slaughter in the US has been banned.|`|RloOJ43haa	In Europe, all the warmblood stud books require that all stallions and mares pass inspections before they are given a license to breed. The must get a license before they breed or the offspring will not be registered. This has the effect of making sure that only the horses that are breeding quality are allowed to breed, and as a result the entire breed improves in quality and value. <br>  <br>  I think that if a similar system were initiated in the US, it would have a very dramatic effect on the quality of US breeds and on population control.|`|7e0e9a04534a32e816cd47711fb850c9aa	I can understand your point on over breeding. I'm not really keen to slaughtering over heads. Also knowing how non respectfully it's done. I don't eat horse meat and never will, but if the breeding was for human or animal consumption, the slaughter houses should not accept the savage transportation of those horses. Europeans eat a lot of horse meat which comes from Canada.<br>  <br>  Having the government put it's nose in that is not a good idea, because if they regulate horse breeding as the cow industry, the market will grow and those majestic animals will no longer be respected as they once were. For the breeders, I can only see the situation as being a win-win situation. Doesn't matter if the horse finds a home or not, they still make money. <br>  <br>  The law or regulation in Quebec is 1-2 horse per 4.5 acres of land. Now I own 114 acres, i am allowed to have, 24 mares, 1 stallion per 100 acres (free land). They calculate 1 foal per mare per 2 years. In total it would be 50 heads max. Which I find very reasonable. Every year they survey all farm owners.<br>  <br>  In Europe horse owners have to chip their horses, if they refuse they are obliged to put down their horse, this law isn't in full effect all over Europe. Most QHs & TBs in Europe come from Canada, they mixed bred to have 16 hands QHs.<br>  <br>  I bought 9 foals from Alberta a few years ago, all were to be registered. Because the middle person did not pay the full amount to the breeders( kept half the money I sent), only one breeder still sent me the transfer papers, the other never did but  gave me mare & sire names, though I had proof of full payment (paid by ck.). <br>  I can see that the over breeding is still going strong in Alberta. If all Canadian provinces state their laws, maybe a good solution and law can be set for Alberta. <br>  <br>  A personal opinion: wild horses should not be captured and sold nor slaughtered, the land they live on should be protected and home owners should fence their back yards if they don't want them around. This earth is to be shared among all living creatures. But greedy breeders should not be permitted to dump over heads among the wild.<br>  <br>  You really have a good debate on ideas and solutions.<br>  <br>  I'm a horse lover, and love the 9 that I added to my gang. Some found new homes.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I think low or no cost euthanasia is a better solution than slaughtering the surplus is.  I am not anti-slaughter per se, but I hate the idea of it and pretty much cried my eyes out the last time I passed a double decker full of horses on the way to Canada.<br>  <br>  It would also be nice if spaying was as commonplace as gelding was.  In small animals, neutering and spaying is common and most people do that as soon as they get a pet, if the pet hasn't already been altered.  If better, less complicated and less expensive ways iof spaying mares were made available, then perhaps it would catch on more.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I believe that the people who breed the horses and then sell them should be ultimately held responsible for what happens to that horse. IE if a horse is found neglected and abused, it is the original breeders obligation to take them in and cover an expenses. This is probably quite unrealistic (first of all, not all horses are registered and it would be impossible to trace some original owners) but it would definitely make people think twice about A) who they sell their horses to and B) breeding in the first place.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	The only way to cut back on the over population is to cut the breeding. This will never happen due to the $$ and greed issue.  The big breeders will keep breeding ,the QH, Paint , and TB .  the slaughter houses are full with these breeds. also the sad ,problem with the premarin foals. we were breeding a few outstanding foals a year and have stopped due to the economy and over population. we will not start breeding again till something is done and the horse glut has stopped.  you can license all breeders but the big boys will take over that also. plus its not going to control the problem. we have enough constraints with government in our lives anyway.  just look and see how they fixed the mustang problem.wow they did a good job there --NOT.  the only answer is stop breeding for 2 years , education and responsible horse ownership.   just follow the $$$ trail..the big boys will never stop breeding ...never...|`|hMeXY5ggaa	Bravo Dallas! Finally, someone who agrees with me. Horse slaughter will be necessary as long as irresponsible/ignorant people are allowed to breed. I do think a license would be a bit harsh-although if this were combined with FQH5256's idea; and imposed for a given number of years, it would knock out most backyard breeders, while still allowing serious horse people to continue their jobs. <br>  I also think all horses (mares and stallions) should be vet cleared before being allowed to breed; and a tax imposed on all births; while this may sound a little drastic, it would majorly retard backyard breeders (making it perhaps cheaper to buy a horse at an auction, and cutting down the number of horses slaughtered).<br>  Also, and this is more of a pet peeve then anything, if people are going to rescue horses why for God's sake, do they insist on picking, and keeping ones that are permanently unsound/healthy? I understand that horses can be drugged, and everyone gets taken once in a while, but seriously the kindest thing would be to euthanize them and try again. There are good horses going to slaughter, and I have a friend who is killing herself working to feed 10 worthless nags. <br>  Ok, sorry for the rant, it just gets on my nerves sometimes.<br>  Message me if you want to chat about it though :-)

AA11457471	There's cat fencing that goes on top of your regular fence & tilts inward. That should work!<br>  Also, if they're able to collapse your fence it's not secured to the posts well enough. Go thru & make sure the fence is tied to every post- especially up high.|`|3zv2bbolaa	If they are collapsing your fence, you need to set the posts into the ground deeper and in cement. <br>  <br>  If they are bracing themselves on the sides or top to pull themselves over, you can use a product called a coyote roller, that works to prevent the dog from gaining traction.|`|jWKMqNOsaa	I totally don't think an electric collar is the answer, because even at high voltage I have seen dogs figure out if they run fast enough, it only hurts for a little and a truly determined dog just isn't stopping for a shock. <br>  <br>  Bury your fence and the posts a bit in the ground, that helps with digging under as well. or, it this fails, go high cost and get one in wood built by a professional, i just cannot see your dog knocking one of those down, unless he is part elephant.

Mine like banana, apple, carrot, cucumber and as a special treat Yogies. <br>  Yogies are basically sugar and yogurt mixed up together.<br>  Depending on how old your rat is and when you got him you should consider getting another. They are very social, intelligent animals and enjoy the company of more of their kind.<br>  Congratulations on your rat and I hope everything goes well.<br>  Hope I helped|`|51St5GEcaa	My baby females get a mix of soy milk, kitten food, canned peas (they absolutely LOVE these) and their rat food all mixed up and microwaved for dinner. <br>  <br>  Throughout the rest of the day they get just about whatever is laying around, plus they're rat food.<br>  <br>  Cucumbers, radishes, apples, carrots, peas, craisins and raisins, wheat crackers, and whatever else I can smuggle out of my campus cafeteria's salad bar.They LOVE cornbread!<br>  <br>  I also keep a jar of mixed nuts for them. <br>  <br>  Just remember, though it's not as important with males as it is with females, cancer and tumors stand less of a chance when you feed your rat a diet rich in soy, blueberries, strawberries, fish, tomato, and all those other foods that have antioxidants. I recommend keeping a dish of soy milk in their cage right along side their water. <br>  <br>  I just made homemade french bread pizza and gave the spoon I used to stir the sauce to the rats to lick. Small things like that are great healthy treats.<br>  <br>  Other things should be sparingly given. You can give them avacado, but you have to be extra careful of the skins and the pit, because they contain strong toxins. And chocolate is up for dispute. Some people say go ahead, some people say don't. But it supposedly opens up the airways (probably because of the caffeine). I had a rat who had a respiratory infection, and before I could get the antibiotics, I just gave him chocolate chips every so often. They seemed to help and had no adverse affects.<br>  <br>  Also. I thought I only wanted one rat, but when I brought her home, the stress almost killed her. She got sick with a respiratory illness the morning after. As soon as I brought her a companion, she perked up enough to eat and move around. Rats need friends. They groom each other, keep each other warm at night, and keep each other calm and sane. I recommend a friend. <br>  good luck.|`|YAPEpa5baa	I hate to tell you this, but the food you're feeding him isn't healthy or good either - so what difference do treats make?  <br>  <br>  Treats should be some real food - some chicken, or meat, or some vegetables.  You also might want to consider a spayed female, or same sex friend, for your "new" rat since they are social creatures, and no human can really devote enough time to a pet rat to meet it's requirements.|`|J1ZrbYsFaa	Actually Rats can eat just about anything we do! I gave mine left over biscuits, cereal, apples, straw berries etc. Anything really. But an EXTRA special treat that me my sister my aunt and my cousin all do is we give them Turtle treats!!!!

She runs excitedly over to her cage door each night to see what we are bringing. Peas are her favorite so far.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Haha my rat just shares whatever I'm eating. In the wild rats generally eat human garbage, so they're kind of built to eat human food. If I'm having pasta for dinner, I give him pasta. If it's chicken, he gets chicken. I've heard it's actually good for them to get meat every now and then, because rats in the wild do eat meat. He will probably be much happier if you get him a friend, single rats need to be out at least 4 hours a day or they get depressed.<br>  And Andy, I'd never heard that about Kaytee.  I'll probably switch now!
AA11707728	You can't.  He has obviously imprinted on you as his mother.  He'll continue that behavior for several months until he becomes a young adolescent cat and then he'll be much more autonomous.  He'll still insist on sleeping with you....likely for life.<br>  <br>  The lesson here is that pets are living creatures with needs far greater than simply being fed.  They aren't toys and come with some rather big responsibilities that aren't obvious when you first decide to get one.|`|wDCjzuPraa	LOL WAT A CUTE CAT THAT EXACTLY TEH SAME THING THAT MY CAT DOES 2 I THINK IT LOVES U SO MUCH AND MAKES U FEEL LIKE UR ITS MUM.

AA11244754	you need to call animal control about this lady abusing/neglecting the dog.  Her kicking it is definitely against the law and there are consequences for her bad behavior.  Look up animal control for your city or town and state and call them.  Just tell them what you have said on here and they will send somebody out to investigate.  You will remain onominous.

I would say if they didn't give me the dog, I would call the police. If they sitll wouldn't then, I might steal the dog and drive him to a different better shelter, assuming it's not microchipped.<br>  <br>  add: honestly, you could take the dog anyway but just to give him up to a rescue org or a good shelter. since he's young, he has a good chance to be adopted. If you trust your local aspca you could just call them. however my local one euthanizes dogs in 48 hrs.<br>  <br>  (if you do get them to give up the dog to you, make sure they sign a contract otherwise they have a case to take the dog back any time they wanted, even after rehoming the dog)|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Hm. Thats a hard one. I suggest just talking to her, no matter how scary she may be. Ask her to take the dog. If she agrees, you can either keep it, giver it away, or send it to a pound. Since its young, a home could be found easily. But, if you truely belive that this dog is being abused (And coming to your house for saftey...) Then calling a local animal shelter may help. But I get the feeling that dog likes you, you never know what may happen =3<br>  Good Luck, to you and the dog.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	1) 3--2 sprites, 1 gib<br>  2) My 3.5 year old girl is named Pixie; my 5 month old girl is named Sian; my 7 month old boy is named Yogi. When Pixie and Yogi are together, I call them 'The Lovebirds'.  When Yogi and Sian are getting into stuff together, I call them 'The Twins' (cue dramatic music).<br>   I had a 3  year old boy, Yew, who was Pixie's littermate, but he passed in September of last year.<br>  3) Pixie's favorite game is wrestling; Sian's favorite game is "Popcorn the Weasel" (or putting her on a blanket and popping it, so she bounces around *g*); Yogi's favorite game is playing chase in the tunnels.<br>  4) Sian loves sleeping in my bed or in my lap; Yogi prefers sleeping in the bed or in the cage (though he will cuddle with me); Pixie likes sleeping in her hidey-hole under my nightstand or in the cage.<br>  5) Their favorite treat is olive oil, and for Pixie and Yogi, a bowl of Carnivore Care.<br>  6)  The cutest thing they ever did?  Hmm.  That's kind of hard.  But, one thing I find very cute is Yogi's protectiveness over his girls.  He even attacked a vet to try and save Pixie (who was yelping and whimpering, because they had to draw blood for an adrenal panel).  He was so distraught.  Then, when Sian had a mild vaccine reaction just a few days ago, he stayed by her all night long.  It's kinda sad, but it's always an 'awww' moment.  He loves his girls :)<br>  7) Of course I do!

He loves tiny pieces of pancake, noodle, and bread.<br>  6) Biscuit amazes me with his cuteness everyday, but what I love is when he sits at my feet for several minutes, just looking up at me, begging for attention.  As for Gravy, he's my mischief-maker.  I love how he will play hide and seek with my black lab puppy, and he leads her around only to scurry away to a hidey hole at the last second.

That was probably what she was doing when she jumped on her, putting her in her place.|`|oSz5U51Haa	She's new and older, could have been just a dominance thing when the puppy got too close to her belly.

Z9zzNYNCaa	Panacur is NOT causing any symptoms. It's a safe effective (that also does giardia) wormer that's extremely hard to OD.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Panacur can have side effects.  My puppy was fine with panacur first time but then has a reaction the second time.<br>  <br>  From what you said, should not be a problem.  Sleepy does not mean reaction to the drug, it could mean the body is taking energy to fight Giardia and that's why she is tired.  She is very young.<br>  <br>  Giardia should kick in within 48 hours, so monitor the stool and see progress...if nothing is improved, go back to the vet and change the drug to Flagyl (it's gentler but take a longer time)
5M57TTfpaa	yes. what i would do though, is give him a whole extra water bottle, and alot of food and hay|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Some Petstores may have pet daycares. He wont be stressed, I have had many moving rabbits and they are all fine. Mostly dogs, cats, and horses get stressed. But for three days alone wouldnt be too good.

YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Rabbits can easily & happily survive 'Subzero' conditions,in fact they do MUCH better in the cold,than in the hot. All my Rabbits are kept outside,all year round,plus live to old ages,rather than a fake quote from Rabbit.org,that "Outdoor kept rabbits will not live for more than 1yr"!!!! As long as they have a place to retreat to,which is draught & water proof,its perfectly safe for them to live outdoors 24/7.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,xxx|`|NLKVrdIKaa	Make sure the bunny cannot reach the insulation. If it does it will eat it and I'm sure that would be a bad thing!
e7773rspaa	Feed them whenever you like, just try not to feed them too much excess.  If they aren't eating all of it within ten minutes or so, it's a little too much.  Excess can lead to lots of gunk on the bottom and in the filter, lots of decay, and lots of dirty water.<br>  <br>  An interesting note... some species of fish have been shown to anticipate when they are being fed... that is... if you feed them at a certain time each day they may learn to be waiting for you... even if you shut the lights off... it's a brain chemistry/circadian rhythm thing!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Depends on when afternoon is. If its noon then at 1 then its to close together. We feed our fish twice daily as well. First thing when getting up then again when going to bed. <br>  <br>  But no it doesn't have to the same time.|`|AraBfesHaa	They'll eat anytime you want to feed them.  They don't need to be on a schedule.|`|LHiEoAOCaa	No, it doesn't matter if you feed them different times each day...just don't overfeed them but leave some time between the afternoon and night...so try to feed them once at 1-3 PM and then feed them at 6-8 PM.|`|crSqd4MPaa	yes
MqYfsYd0aa	some cats just seem to want to go/be outside.  i had a cat exactly like that, and i was extremely hesitant to let him outside, and i think it stemmed from him being born out on a farm, and having that outdoor experience early on.  i've also met a cat who was a stray, and now that he was a nice home, will not go outside even when prompted by it's owners.  but yeah, altering the cat doesn't take away the desire to be amongst the grass.<br>  <br>  what i've done with my cats, is set up a perch at a window, and open the window and let them get the fresh air, and it gives them a view.  since i live in an apartment, i also allow my cats out on the balcony, but only under my supervision.<br>  <br>  you can keep trying the harness route,  it takes some time for the cat to get used to it.  as well, you could just wait until she gets a little bigger, and let her outside.  if i ever went outside beyond the balcony with my cat, i stayed with him and if he ever went too far for my comfort level, i went and got him.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She needs to stay inside.  Get her a nice tall cat tree to play on and hide treats around the house for her to hunt.  Cardboard boxes and paper bags provide hours of fun for cats.  Just find things to keep her busy and don't give in.  She'll be fine and be safer indoors.  Would you let a two year old outside just because he whined at the door?|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	how much in the way of cat trees or cat furnature do you have in your house stuff that she can climb on?  you can go to walmart and get a 3 level cat tree for about $30.   Please do not allow your cat to go outside, you are right for worrying about her, there is no good that will come from her going out there, only pain for her and for you and your bank account when you have to take her to the vet when she get attacked by other animals.
LIxpXTnLaa	the wet food is like junk food. they crave it even when they're not hungry. not so with the dry food.<br>  <br>  compare the two like comparing vegetables and junk food with a human.|`|TUWK70vgaa	Alternate the the Wet Food/ Dry Food days.

I feed my cats a good high quality food, Wellness.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	You've probably noticed that cats are picky eaters!  If your cat doesn't like the wet food it'll try to get something else.  You might try switching brands.<br>  <br>  The weird thing about cats is that they'll starve rather than eat something they don't like.  They'll also suddenly reject something they used to like.<br>  <br>  About begging in general, if the cat begs at the table, you can spray it with a squirt bottle when it begs.

If you just used a pool as a tank, with no chlorine, then it would probably be fine but then you couldn't swim in it.|`|sDwN4XuIaa	The best be twould be to create a pond area for the fish.  Koi grow to a decent size.  The cholrine in the pool would kill it, as the level needed for it to be safe for humans to swim in is much to high for a fish to live in.  If the pool has not been cholrinated then I dont see why not......  If it is just to store it for a short period of time.  You may really wnat ot look into a tank or a pond though.  Ponds are not that hard to install and are beautiful when completed|`|76cAAPfBaa	Yes, but you will need some sort of aerator, as the water will probably get quite hot, which gives up oxygen, and then can make them suffocate. Keep them out of direct sun with shade, unless the pool is deep. Don't use chlorined water of course!<br>  <br>  Koi are basically CARP, and can live almost anywhere. They do tend to stir up muck a lot, so the water won't stay clean.|`|tLQ4YDLbaa	Yes as long as the water isn't pool water that should be fine. Just make sure you would treat it as you would treat and pond or tank with koi

iLpyQSX5aa	yes, but not too many. You actually need fish to get the cycle going. You'll just have to check amonia and nitrite levels and do weekly water changes until the tank is cycled.<br>  EDIT: It amazes me that so many people don't know the whole story about how to cycle a tank. Let me start with a direct quote from a reputable website about cycling:"New tanks are generally broken in by adding a few hardy fish and simply waiting out that first month. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CYCLING PROCESS DOES NOT START UNTIL FISH ARE ADDED. Some hobbyists set up their aquarium for weeks or even months before adding fish, and are surprised to see high ammonia and nitrite readings shortly after fish are finally added".  Please read the entire content at <a href="http://www.bestfish.com/breakin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfish.com/breakin.html</a> and then make your decision. Just trying to help and obviously there are some misguided people with misguided answers. I've cycled many tanks in my life and have had very few problems.|`|PqT6pQAoaa	They might survive but keep in mind cycling a tank with fish reduces their lifespan and they will suffer from it since ammonia and nitrite are going to be soaring throughout the tank which "burns" their eyes. To them, it feels like shampoo is in their eyes so i would recommend not cycling with the fish. It actually takes longer to cycle with fish. Here is a faster way:<br>  <br>  Go to a grocery store and buy a bottle of clear pure ammonia (with no dyes, perfumes, etc). This can be found in the cleaning isle. Just add a few drops in your tank until you get an ammonia level of 4.0 ppm. Wait one week and check to see if it has gone down. If it did go down, then a few more drops to bring it back up to about 3.0 ppm. Continue doing this and eventually the ammonia and nitrite drop down to 0.<br>  <br>  Also, have the temperature to about 85 degrees because this can speed up the process. You can also borrow gravel and filter media from an established tank and put it in your new tank. This will help the bacteria to multiply faster.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! Best answer?? :D|`|oSz5U51Haa	I had a 30-gallon tank and put fish in it the same day I filled it and they all survived. I made sure, of course, to float the bag they were in to equalize the water temperature, and VERY slowly introduce small bits of my water into the bag until it was finally all my water, and they were not expensive fish. I have had several tanks and never went through the whole cycling process. On the other hand, I have well water.....maybe that makes a difference...
enC9TvxUaa	-NEED to find a good local breeder so you can help with the raising and weening!  (The local shops here will not even sell toos due to their neurotic behaviors!  Mine is the only one they can even handle without gloves when doing wing/nail trims.)<br>  <br>  If this is your first bird, DO NOT get a cockatoo!  Ours is wonderful, but he is quite the handful!  We needed a lot of advice, still do, and the experience we had from our other bird we had for 2 years before getting the too.  A local bird only store, or breeder, can be an invaluable resource for getting the right bird, and for many years afterwards for simple questions, nail/wing trims, toys, etc.  Develop a relationship with a local breeder and you're on to a great start!|`|HQsmRzPsaa	www.cockatooconnection.comthis is where i got mine. he is hand fed and the sweetest thing in the world. he is now a 6 month old male unbrella cockatoo. they have many different kinds of cockatoos. they are a great place to buy from!!|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	mytoos.com<br>  <br>  Cockatoos are one of the (in my opinion THE) hardest parrot to care for....huge commitment.

MUfMJYHGaa	Is this a written contract? Go over it carefully and look at the terms.If you have a witness or a written statement to what this woman said regarding the horse and he does not fulfill this promise, you can return the horse. Since you are not paying her she cannot collect any "lost fees". As for his condition, use the pictures and written statements from people who have seen this horse throughout the lease period.Get him in the best shape you can, write her a certified letter and return the horse with 2 witnesses. Documentation is always your best ally if she tries to sue you. Did she ever check up on this horse? Did she ask you to change anything in his care regimen? Did she ever attempt to resolve the problems you were having with him? All this will come into play IF she tries to sue. Anyone can sue for anything. But if she cannot prove that you devalued or harmed the horse or created a financial loss for her, she is wasting her time and money. She is probably just using a lawsuit as a threat. Contact animal services if she refuses to take the horse back when you return him. If this was an oral contract. it's "worth the paper it was written on" and becomes a he said, she said case which would hinge on reliable witnesses and documentation.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Copy the ads if you can.  Get anything you can which shows what she claimed the horse could do and what he really did not do.|`|4627db3161084bce021d06067966d9f0aa	it sounds like you did everything you could and did it well.  The only thing you didn't do is check the horse out before you took him home.  When I look at a horse to buy, I really look at him and attempt to pick up his feet, ride him and handle his head at the very least.  You can get a good idea then if he is skittish or hard to handle at that first meeting.<br>  <br>  I don't think she has a leg to stand on for a law suit.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	If I were you, I would put together copies of everything you did for the horse (farrier bills, feed bills, vet bills, etc.), as well as any evidence of the abilities she claimed for the horse, like the ads.  If you have pictures, videos - whatever, that show his condition when you got him, and after you had him, I would gather that, too.<br>  <br>  Its unlikely she could win a lawsuit just for his losing weight, since she did not specify that in the contract, but I found out the hard way it just depends on the judge, and people can sue for pretty much anything.  I lost a lawsuit in small claims court, and that judge did not even look at the evidence, but I was able to win it on appeal.
EtasLJB0aa	20 gallon sounds good. But I really suggest having another 10 gallon on hand, because if they start to stress each other out one gecko or both could get hurt, lose a tail, or stop eating, etc, and you'd have to separate them.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I dont believe in keeping lizards together, unless you can keep them in ridiculously large spaces they just get stressed out by each others presence, and toe/tail removal is not uncommon. If I was to go for it, I'd be keeping them in a six foot viv. better just to get two three foots, its easier.<br>  <br>  Edit: What are people on? Two foot isnt even big enough for ONE leo.|`|zTeLhroWaa	20 gallon should be okay, though to keep everyone from getting completely stressed the tank should be at least 2 feet by 1 foot...if not 2x2 or bigger|`|u3ElUnJIaa	Dont listen to these retards a 10gallon will be just enough room.|`|PIwP8DFxaa	20 gallon|`|wLgGD63raa	You need something that will be comfortable enough to have three (3) hides EACH for them. So, really, I'd say a 40 gallon. I have a 20 gallon with 3 hides for just one Leo and there would be barely any room for another hide in there.

826a4f1a78893ae0a8476782246aae2aaa	The cheapest way is to make one yourself. Its really easy to do, very cheap and gets the same results as any commerical incubators. But the best reason way is because you can customise the size to have it as big or as small as you like.<br>  <br>  Ok so all you need is some heat cord, a box or plastic eskey or cooler, and a probe thermostat. If your handy you can make the wooden box or just buy a suitable sized container. Snake the heat cord evenly through out all the walls which you would fix into place. You can can then put a wire grid suspended about half way up the container. Put your egg containers (containing your mix) on the grid and a the probe of the thermostat and a digital thermometer in the container and stablise your temps once stablised its already to have eggs placed inside.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	know you can make them out of dorm fridges or coolers.google it|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Yes, you can order a Hovabator for about forty bucks from <a href="http://lllreptile.com." rel="nofollow">http://lllreptile.com.</a> I know many people who use them with great results.|`|e7773rspaa	Yes.

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	There isn't a difference.  It's just what terms people prefer (spay/neuter=altered)..  There IS  a difference between altering and vasectomized (vasectomized males still have the urge as if they were intact, but they are sterile).  Sometimes altered animals will do this, especially if they had mated before being altered (the scent of an animal in heat will trigger memory and instinct).<br>  <br>  No, mating when fixed will not kill an animal.  She possibly could have contracted an illness (ie--feline leukemia, etc) from him, or it could have just been coincidence.  But the act, itself, wouldn't have killed her.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your friend's loss.  Best wishes.
p3vjvzRPaa	I hope you change your mind and don't put your girl through the stress of breeding, but to answer your question...<br>  <br>  Stud fees vary a lot - both across and within breeds.<br>  <br>  If we assume you'll be looking for a good quality stud dog, then you will find that some top winners, or imports may have a higher fee than other quality dogs.<br>  <br>  Often the stud fee is roughly the same as the price of a single puppy, but I have heard of breeds where that doesn't apply.  <br>  <br>  Prices will vary in different countries and even regions too.<br>  <br>  Best idea would be to search for breeders who have stud dogs and ask them direct.|`|aCqSF87Raa	At this point i would think more about your female and the fees you'll need to spend on HER than the stud dog and fees for HIM. Those will be the lightest, i'm sure, and he will be the easiest to produce. Here are a few things to consider.<br>  <br>  1) The first set of breeding fees will be for genetic testing (hips, eyes, elbows, brucellosis, etc) once she turns two - that is the minimum age for breeding, by the way. If you do not do health checks you risk passing on painful and deadly diseases to the pups. <br>  <br>  Any sooner than two years and she may be too young physically AND mentally to go through the process of mating, carrying, and whelping. It may mean more complications, death of mom and pups, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/gscreen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/gscreen.ht...</a><br>  <br>  2) The next set will be the general vet fees. One for a confirmation of pregnancy. One for an x-ray or ultrasound to check on number of puppies. And one for and x-ray or ultrasound to check on their size right before whelping due date.<br>  <br>  If you skimp out on these then you will be going in blind and you risk losing the b*tch to complications (the pups could be too big, which can result in them getting stuck in the birth canal.)<br>  <br>  3) Then you'll have the puppies fees: worming, shots, food, vet checks, registrations, etc. And what if you can't find homes? Considering the fact that MANY people are LOSING their dogs due to inability to care for them financially, you may ahve a hard time placing them.<br>  <br>  Then you have general fees for THEM as well as mom. For anywhere from 1-6+ puppies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.omalmalamutes.com/omal/littercost.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.omalmalamutes.com/omal/litter...</a><br>  <br>  4) And throughout this you'll have your normal dog care fees for food, supplies, grooming, training, etc. As well as your normal dog care needs: exercise, grooming, etc.<br>  <br>  Can you do that for all puppies plus mom if you need to? Have the time? The money?<br>  <br>  Breeding is not something to do unless your dog has the bloodlines, the Ch titles, and you have the time and money. The b*tch could die (very high risk if you don't have a mentor), you will lose $$, you won't gain much if any $$, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.learntobreed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.learntobreed.com/</a>|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Well, once she turns six months old, enter her in conformation shows- which is the best place to meet qualified studs.  Typically the price is equivalent to what the stud owner would charge for one puppy. Don't forget that pomeranians should have their patellas OFA certified before breeding and poms often need c-sections, which are dangerous and costly.|`|Bw18seFqaa	ussually either one pick of litter, or the cash value of a puppy...  be aware, small breeds like Poms may often only have one or two puppies.. so there's no cash to be made from breeding!<br>  <br>  No one with a decent male will breed to your dog tho until you've prooven that she's breeding quality.<br>  <br>  Your first step is to show her and earn her CH title.. you can begin showing in about 3 months.. go to www.infodog.com to find upcoming shows.  You may want to go to a few by yourself before entering your dog to talk to breeders and handlers and see what its like.<br>  <br>  Also find an experienced mentor who can help you research breeding, genetics, whelping, puppy raising, pedigrees, health issues, etc.<br>  <br>  Develop a good relationship with your vet.  You will need it when she's whelping at 3 am and has a pup stuck.<br>  <br>  Save money.. you will need funds for showing, health tests, travel, stud fees, and prenatal care..  on top of the funds for this, you should also have at least $3,000-5,000 saved for emergency care.<br>  <br>  <br>  When she is 2 years old, she needs genetic health tests thru the OFA, CERF, BAER and Optigen, as well as a brucellosis test.<br>  <br>  After all of this, your mentor can help you select a suitable stud.|`|P4CADDPdaa	Well, it's usually the price of one puppy. <br>  <br>  But it doesn't seem like you actually know how to breed since this is one of the simplest things to know. Before you do breed look up how many dogs and cats are in shelters! You shouldn't breed unless you want to better the breed, and if that was the case you would probably buy a male instead of paying stud fees. Usually poms have 3-5 puppies, depending on the size of the female he is bred to. If she had 4, that would take away 4 dogs that could have had a home that were in desperate need. But if you are going to keep the puppies, I personally don't see a problem with it. Just look up risk of breeding your female.|`|FdcWPp48aa	The cost of selling one puppy or a pick of the litter is usual.  You should put a lot of thought into breeding your girl.  No pregnancy is without risks.  If your girl has any genetic problem and/or the stud you choose, you will be bring pups into the world that is already so over crowded by the way, that may have terrible health problems.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	First of all, you NEVER breed a dog until she's at least two years old.<br>  <br>  Millions of dogs are euthanized in shelters each year because backyard breeders.  <br>  <br>  No decent breeder with a good male would breed to your dog.<br>  <br>  You do know that these small breeds commonly need c-sections which cost upwards of $2000.00.<br>  <br>  You do know that your dog should have all health and genetic testing done before breeding?<br>  <br>  You do know that your dog should have her breed championship before breeding?  Once she has her championship, you'll have people knocking on your dog to breed.<br>  <br>  You do know that you could possibly lose your dog due to pregnancy/whelping complications?<br>  <br>  You do have a breed mentor, right?<br>  <br>  You will offer a health guarantee with the pups?<br>  <br>  You will take a pup back should someone need to surrender one, for any reason.<br>  <br>  You do know that with every heat cycle, your dog's chances of cancer increase?<br>  <br>  You will take deposits from potential puppy buyers to insure that they are serious and won't back out when the pups are born.  <br>  <br>  If you have to ask questions on Yahoo Answers, you have NO business breeding.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to get BASHED here.|`|AA11244754	If he's 3 months old he is WAY too young to even think of being a stud and also you need to actually know something about breeding to know how much to ask for.  Since you clearly don't know what you are doing, in 3 months get your dog neutered and forget about it.|`|7e22a1b7de650843d2dd580cc4ddb41aaa	i would think twice ab out it if i were you there are already lots of dogs being abandoned because the owners cant feed them or take them to a vet|`|PM23RDycaa	For a stud its pick of the litter or stud fee which is the cost of one pup, usually a show quality one.<br>  <br>  Unless you have a breed mentor, plan on doing the proper genetic clearances, making her into a champion, spending the next two years learning all that you need to learn and there is plenty, don't bother and have her spayed.<br>  <br>  Your reason for wanting to breed should NOT to have puppies a couple of times. That is not the purpose of proper breeding. Only bybs breed to have pups. Reputable breeders breed to improve and preserve the breed.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Only breed her when:<br>  <br>  1.  She is AKC registered and you breed her to another AKC registered Pom only.<br>  2.  She is over 2 yrs old<br>  3.  She has been shown in championship and earned her champion title.<br>  4.  She has been tested for genetic problems in the breed.<br>  5.  You have written permission for the breeder to breed her.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the above, then spay her.<br>  <br>  If she is show/breeding quality, then worry about stud fees later - and if she is shown you can make contacts with other breeders for the future.
R3E8DkTfaa	Without a picture it is hard to be sure, but you may have a parasite, such as a leech.  you mentioned a black bit in the middle of one of the sores.  Does it seem to be something that is attached to your fish, or is it part of the fish itself?  I assume that only the one fish is affected, have you added anything new to the tank that might have carried a parasite in with it.  Plants, rocks, wood, anything at all that might have carried a parasite is suspect.  A slightly low ph isn't going to have caused this.  There is an outside chance that it is Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia.   But if so there should be other symptoms such as swollen abdomen, swollen and bruised looking eyes, bruised or bleeding gills.   It is fatal, and very contagious.  I doubt that this is the problem, but just thought I should mention it. <br>  <br>  As for the white fluffy material on the cut, you have a secondary fungal infection I recommend that you treat this with Marycyn Plus or Triple Sulfa.  Both will treat fungal as well as bacterial infections.  If you have any more information or can take some pictures for us to see, that would be very helpful.|`|hFU31zm7aa	she might have a parasite do some research on it some where it needs to be treated immediately i would separate her from other fish till you know what it is.|`|MJbXxrjXaa	Idk about the fish, but a really great way to lower your PH is to go to your local pet shop and buy some "Proper PH 7.0" made by API. It really helps and keeps PH at 7 for a long time. And the really good thing about it is that if your PH goes either up or down, it will correct it back to 7.
360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	If your cat is going to be indoors and you have no other pets going outside, then the flea treatment and worming tablets aren't really necessary.<br>  <br>  The rest looks good, although I've never used that brand of cat food, so you will have to figure that one out once you get the cat. I use IAMS, but that could be personal preference.<br>  <br>  Tap water is more than fine, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  The scratching post looks ok, but it could be over stimulating if you are getting a young kitten. Try looking for one that is a simple post with rope wrapped around it. Especially is you plan on buying other toys separately.<br>  <br>  You don't really need TOO many toys with cats, or at least you don't need to spend a lot of money on them. Experience has taught me that the more money spent on the toy, the more that cat likes the box it came in better. A ping pong ball or a paper bag (without handles) has kept many a cat busy for hours.<br>  <br>  Everything else looks just fine by me. Have fun with your new pet :)|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	just to let you know the worming and flea treatments you need to get from your vet anything that you get in the stores can potentially be lethal to your cat or not work at all.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Everything looks just fine except for that food! It contains maize (corn) and gluten meal.. not so hot for cats. I assume you're in the UK, judging on that website? I know Orijen is available there.. check it out!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.orijen.ca/orijen/about/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orijen.ca/orijen/about/</a><br>  <br>  Enjoy your new kitty. :)|`|teFKJflZaa	i had one of the scratching posts from there and it wasn't heavy enough, so i fell on top of him when he used it. also i would rethink the food, Just from my experience it didn't really give my cat a good healthy coat, but that could just be my cat. and my top tip for flea treatment is a product called 4fleas, the collar or the drops. both work really well<br>  hope i helped and good luck with your new cat :)|`|MqYfsYd0aa	about the only things i would be concerned about would be the at home worming and flea treatments.  sometimes the store bought products aren't nearly as effective as what the vet would administer or sell you.  you would be best to go that route instead.  otherwise, everything else looks good... people never need to get too fancy with things like litter boxes, scratching posts, etc.  as long as they work, and the cat likes it (some cats can be a little finicky that way)|`|KpO4UtElaa	yes, cats can survive just fine on much less fancy things than these. your cat will be fine, don't worry!!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Unless your cat has worms I wouldn't give her the dewormer.  Even though it is a very good product and what your vet would most likely use to treat worms, if she doesn't have them, she doesn't need it.  I would invest in a cat tree instead of just a post.  Cat trees provide hours of fun and cats seem to like scratching them better than posts because they can incorporate climbing along with the scratching.  Check these trees out.  They seem like good ones at reasonable prices.<br>  <a href="http://www.cattrees.co.uk/large-cat-trees.html?osCsid=e8a49202b6302f96192a89f3824fc535" rel="nofollow">http://www.cattrees.co.uk/large-cat-tree...</a><br>  <br>  I would find a high quality wet food to feed.  Here's a very informative article on selecting a good food for your cat.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=004" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|gndS3jslaa	With regards to food, just make sure to watch the ash and calcium content because it can affect crystalization causing an urinary tract infection. I wouldn't buy store brand foods, but it also doesn't need to be the best of the best, unless you can afford it. :) as for litter pans, scratching posts, cats really aren't picky about that. my cats have always had the walmart (inexpensive retail discount chain) litter pan, they use it fine. the lids i find really dont do much for keeping smell or litter contained. maybe i just have messy cats. brushing? is your cat a long hair? that's the only one of my cats that enjoys being brushed. the short hairs hate the brush. depends on the cat. as for worming and fleas medication? i get that straight from my vets. i dont' mess around when it comes to medications and flea treatments. toys? depends on the cat. i've got one cat that never plays with toys. she's content to steal the caps off of pens, milk rings, and balls of tin foil. i've got another one that adores toys, still another one who falls somewhere in the middle. again depends on the cat.
UC9Wjjscaa	I think it is good for them to get out of hutch.  I had the same problem as you on confining him because I did not have a safe area to put him in.  I think my dogs thought he was dinner initially when I brought him home.  Anyway I made a small pen using wood and chicken wire.  It is light weight and easy to move about, it is not huge. Just big enough for him to hop around get some exercise and new smells and tasted.  If you don't have a grassy area I would consider putting some plants (check and make sure they won't harm him when ate) and let him nibble on those while in pen. I also bring mine in the house from time to time and let him hop about and socialize.  He does really well and the cats like him.  The kids love playing with him when he is inside. Another thought if you get him young they sell leashes designed for rabbits.  You could put him on leash and let him hop around and exercise. <br>  P.S. Always supervise him when he is in pen just incase he gets out.|`|MpzPfzivaa	It is important to let him get regular exercise. You might consider building a large perimeter fence around his hutch. They also make leashes for rabbits, they will not walk on it like a dog though and is not the greatest for true exercise I suggest you get some books on caring for rabbits from the library and read through them before deciding if a rabbit is the right animal for you.|`|XI2iylR4aa	It's better to keep your rabbit inside, in a bunny-proofed room.  If you leave the bun outside in a hutch all of the time, he will not get enough exercise.  Rabbits need 4 hours of exercise a day.  They also need interaction, so if you keep him inside you can play with him more.<br>  <br>  I would not let the rabbit into a place that he could easily escape from.  That is just asking for trouble.|`|ue23j5OLaa	It depends on what type of rabbit you are planning on purchasing. Some rabbits are meant for indoor only like mine. Don't put your rabbit into the garden! There might be harmful plants he could eat and he can run away very easily. Do a little research on the type of rabbit before you purchase him/her! ?|`|aBwk1lsFaa	Don't do it, there are many predators, and the insects may harm and bite your rabbit. There are cats, raccoons, and others just waiting for a delicious rabbit meal. Most likely, your rabbit will escape as well. Good luck!|`|ndXmBzYlaa	don't put it in the garden if it can get away. make a fenced in area where there is grass.
FDdUMtqlaa	i think your cat has something like a brain injury or head trauma they most likely have it in a rehab facility for animals or a infirmary. or it has died or has been put down<br>  <br>  sorry i hope they will talk to you soon|`|7toznquyaa	If your cat as walking funny with her head tilted, it's more than a "skinny cat" issue.  It's a sign that something was seriously wrong.<br>  <br>  Just because she got a rabies shot doesn't mean she didn't already have rabies.  Although I don't think those are the symptoms.<br>  <br>  It's likely that your kitty was very ill.. and is either in quarantine or has since passed away. <br>  <br>  Either way, it's unlikely that you have the means to care for a very sick cat.  That's the reason they wouldn't give her back.  They won't put you in a position of spending thousands of dollars on a sick cat. <br>  <br>  Send you letter to the state.. and wait for a reply.   I don't think you're gonna get the answer that you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck.
s6YmD7vaaa	Genetics could be playing a part in your dog's problem, but that can be easily overcome by proper nutrition.  I bet you're feeding your dog wet / canned food instead of kibble.  If so, AT LEAST mix in some dry kibble w/the canned food.  The kibble will help to clean & scrape tartar from your dog's teeth.  I've never brushed my dog's teeth (she won't let me!) but our vet says she has "pearly whites & her teeth are in excellent condition."  I DO give her a "Dental Treat" once a week - & she eats Wellness kibble (with a little canned food mixed in for flavor.)|`|ERjGLJaEaa	No, its not normal at only 3 to have that many teeth pulled. Do you feed your dog wet food? I know that wet food is REALLY bad for dogs teeth. Also the condition of your dogs teeth can be genetic. There is no need to brush your dogs teeth. If it makes you feel better it won't hurt, but usually the vet will put a sealant on the teeth when they clean them.|`|AA10412922	Small dogs have more dental problems,and you need to brush her teeth more often.To have 6 pulled at that age is alot.Try flossies to help clean her teeth too|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It can be genetic to have bad teeth.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	There is NO need to brush a dog.  My vet has put a sealant on my dog's teeth.  No, it's not normal for a 3 year old dog to lose so many teeth.  Don't your dogs get stuff like hard biscuits, bones?<br>  <br>  KELNASON, OH, Rawhide is one of the worse things you can give a dog.  When swallowed, it can swell up in the intestines and cause internal blockages.  Greenies are also REALLY bad for dogs, since they basically do the same thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Go to your butcher and have him/her cut up knuckles bones in the appropriate size for your dog.  I'll be really surprised if your dog doesn't chew on those.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Genetics can play a role in it, yes.  My breed is prone to dental loss, and fanciers have noticed that some of the better lines are retaining their teeth better than other lines.<br>  <br>  Small dogs are also prone to dental problems because the teeth are more crammed in the mouth.<br>  <br>  Diet also plays a role.. does she eat hard kibble or soft foods?  Soft foods tend to cause more plaque buildup.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dont feed your dog rawhides..  they are dangerous.. they pose a choking hazard, and also do not digest well, so also cause a blockage.  Many rawhides are also processed with dangerous chemicals and preservatives.  Rawhides do not clean teeth anyways, the turn "mushy" as the dog chews on it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Increase the brushing like the vet suggested..   commercial diets really were not designed to properly clean teeth and do cause plaque build up.<br>  <br>  You can give her a raw meaty bone (for a small dog, a raw beef rib would do) a few times a week to chew on..  the act of ripping the meat from the bone is what cleans dog's teeth.  Look at pictures of wolves baring their teeth.. you never see plaque build-up..  mother nature knows what she's doing!|`|2G6b5y8Taa	im bout to have to go thou the something with my 7 month old chihuahua bailey its a trait of chihuahuas that they don't lose there baby teeth that is probubly what it is  my dog is a chewer and i brush her teath dailey and her breath is still bad and she hase to get 4 of her teeth removed|`|nFiTpDAeaa	Chihuahuas are known for having really bad teeth.<br>  <br>  Make sure that she is eating kibble.

She died from complications from surgery to set the bone.  Here's what I learned:<br>  <br>  1.  Amputation is a much better option than losing your bun.  From what I understand, they adapt quite well, and an amputation surgery is usually no big deal for a bun.<br>  2.  USE A COMPETENT RABBIT VET!!!!

cSOwqXKxaa	Since their inherent instincts and personalities are quite different, it's hard to recommend one over the other.  Personally, I LOVE Bernese Mt.

Tkr8F0bQaa	no,u helped him.by all means feed him anytime u want!unlike some animals,squirrels dont enter a winter-long ,full hibernation state like a bear.they wake up on slightly warmer days,at intervals,and look for food,water.u made his search for food a bit easier.its like feeding birds.it doesnt make them dependant,thats a myth.if a feeder is left unfilled,they simply go elsewhere in their area to look for food.and with so many people feeding birds/critters in the winter,thats not hard for the birds-or the squirrels to do.the squirrell is only used to u,not tame or dependant.enjoy watching him!he still remains a fully wild animal,with all the skills he needs to survive,even if u go on vacation or something!THE INFO THE FIRST ANSWERER GAVE U IS COMPLETELY INCORRECT!|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Squirrels don't hibernate like the tortoise or hedgehog.<br>  When it is very cold they semi hibernate, but whenever the temperature rises a little they wake up even in the middle of Winter and hunt for caches of food.<br>  Yours is probably fine, in fact he would have stored up quite a lot of fat reserves when you were feeding him so would have stood a better chance of surviving.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Hibernation helps store foood and survive. But you feeding him means he depends on you now to get food, and will not longer. If you ever stop, odds are he will die. He should be okay if the cold dosnt hurt him (Which it shouldnt...) and you keep feeding him. Just be careful and never feed wild animals, no matter how desperate they look. (If you ever go by an absolutly starving animal, I suggest calling and animal reserve who will take it in, nourish it, then set it back with the knowledge to care for itself)<br>  At this point, Im not sure what could be done here. If he stops getting food for himself, and starts coming more then once a week, I suggest calling someone. But if he only goes once a week, odds are thats only when he really cant find food and he has some sources. It might help to call someone to see when/if you should stop.<br>  Good Luck!|`|I0irPMvYaa	squirrels are  supposed to find there own food, if you give them food there going to stop burying nuts. Maybe feeding them once a month!<br>  Carry on feeding it now tho, it will act as a pet<br>  Best wishes<br>  xxxx|`|nMe35c9Aaa	squirrels do not hibernate. they sleep a little more in the winter, in Northern states. mostly cause it is to cold for them to be outside. and they eat more like hibernating animals do in the fall to get fat for winter because food is harder to find in the winter. so mostly likely you just made this squirrels life a little easier by giving him food so he didn't have to scrounge around for it. which is probably why he sticks around!lol <br>  <br>  and squirrels will not stop burring nuts or finding there own food just cause you are feeding them it just makes it easier on them. i feed my squirrel everyday and he still hides nuts all over my room and digs for food in the bottom of his cage and he has never been a wild squirrel or met a wild squirrel. its there instinct to find food where they can. squirrels are opportunistic eaters, scavengers. its in there nature to stay near a steady food source.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Squirrels don't hibernate the same way other animals do.  They become inactive and sleep a lot more often in the winter, but they don't "hibernate" like a bear would because they wake up from time to time.  I am sure your squirrel still knows how to find his own food, so no you didn't hurt him at all.<br>  <br>  However, it is very bad for him to not be afraid of humans.  If he isn't afraid of humans he might get too close to them and get injured, either accidentally by a car or on purpose by a mean person.|`|NLKVrdIKaa	Squirrels on semi hibernate. They carry food to their den tree spring, summer and fall. Winter comes they may sleep for several days and then get out searching for food  but usually eat stored food from their 'midden' heap as the  food they stored is called.You have in no way harmed this animal so quit worrying.
0nIwKd5Uaa	I would call <br>  <br>  The dog warden<br>  Animal Care and Control<br>  Or the SPCA<br>  Even the police if the situation is bad enough. <br>  <br>  Take pictures or video for proof as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  I personally wouldn't say anything to them. Animal abusers scare me, but i'd call until someone showed up to do something.<br>  <br>  I also agree with Jen recently someone called the dog warden on us over our Great Dane. They thought he was underweight because he has that deep where is stomach is. ( hope that made sense) they thought he wasn't being fed. <br>  <br>  Nothing was done because when the dog warden showed up he knew about Great Danes, and we had vet records to prove he is of great health.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Call the local dog warden and talk with them, if they feel that it is abuse they will check it out.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	call the police and a/c  no animal should be abused  but some byb should be|`|AJxl0IvHaa	call animal control, or the sherriffs department!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I'd make darn good and sure it was a case of "abuse" before I did anything.  <br>  <br>  Too often, people think they see abuse and it's not always abuse.  For example, a dog that looks like skin and bones could be abused or it could be a loved and cared for, albeit sick pet.  <br>  <br>  I'm all for stopping animal abuse, but I'm not for accusing everyone you see of abusing animals just because you happen to think it might be abuse.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Definitly Call. People need to learn animals arnt just items you can throw away. They have lives like everyone else, and deserve a better home then being mistreated. If you ever see an Abused Child, you would do the same.<br>  Good luck on your Report <3|`|XavY3fiWaa	I would call animal control so they can make sure it is definitely a cruelty case.|`|pf5G6ssJaa	You should call because you wont  want the dog to get seriously hurt or die.|`|UEHsqSaTaa	Call the humane center.|`|Py9zyABGaa	yes I would definitely call the humane society.. whatever type of animal it is!|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	i would kick their a$$|`|SqWJCZyeaa	Well you should make sure it is definitely animal abuse before you report anything.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/163366/signs_to_watch_for_when_you_suspect.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  that site should help you with that. so then if you're sure it's animal abuse, you should call animal control or animal cops and then the animal cops or animal control should arrest the owner and give the dog medical attention.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Find out what the situation is first. I have a Bully Breed Rescue and we currently have 18 dogs. The regulars at the dog park all know me, but we've had new people come in and even yell at me when they see a battle scarred dog or a really short ear crop. Once a lady called the police because I had a little female named Queenie at the park who had the side of her face disfigured by someone ripping another dog off her. Lucky me, the officer who came was one of the officers present during the raid on fighting dogs where Queenie came from and knew I do rehab since my local shelter has an immediate euthanasia on pit bulls policy.
9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	You've got a Northern Mockingbird in your yard..they are notorious night singers.  Hopefully once he finds a mate and starts to nest he will calm down a little.  He may still sing to protect his territory but it may not be a much or if the nest is away from your house he may be far away enough so you won't hear him.  If you can still hear him I suggest a white noise machine or ear plugs to help you sleep.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Lucky you. THis means good luck. As soon as he finds a suitable mate he will stop.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	That's a Belgian Miracle Bird, come to bring you good luck!|`|QxIhMHwAaa	That sounds/looks like a mockingbird. I had one around my house once that would sing outside my window in the wee hours of the morning as well...the one near me would mimic those car alarms that cycle through 4 different alarms in succession. It annoyed the bejeebers out of me! Luckily he didn't come by EVERY night, but a few times a week. I was still seriously ready to hunt down the bird though, lol. I never got used to him, but I was eventually able to better tune him out. Eventually (about a month) he went away... I know that's not horribly helpful, but that's my story for ya!|`|YBZu3YNoaa	Sounds like a mockingbird. Good luck with that. I've heard they can be very annoying. Hope he finds a mate soon, the males usually sing more than the females when they're unmated.|`|4UIR1YuQaa	Throw a shoe at the bird, just make sure it's not a politician.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-From the pic, this IS a mockingbird.  He is singing getting ready for Spring.  You are lucky to have nature's sounds right outside your bedroom.  Sorry about the 1:00am part, that is very unusual!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your solution:  I suggest buying some earplugs so you can get some sleep.

8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	My golden pups were fast learners.  Crate training was a Godsend and they both took to it fast.  I taught "sit for everything" from day one - dinner, treats, petting, playing, everything.  They leaned sit within a day and not to jump very fast.  Get lots of chew toys and teach them early that they are the only acceptable things to chew.  We have had no chewing problems because we started on it early.|`|PshRhxqraa	I've had two retrievers and they were a doddle to train.  Just kindness and food!  They are so eager to please it can bring tears to your eyes to see them trying to work out what you want them to do and being so pleased with themselves when they get it right.  Best dogs in the world :-)<br>  <br>  By the way, I always liked Maisie as a name but the rest of the family couldn't agree.  How about messing around with her pedigree name until you find something that fits?  Our pup's 'proper' name was Moondust May so we called her Dusty.|`|rVv5TC4Uaa	My Golden I had was very easy to train, they are very love-able and people friendly.<br>  They do anything if a reward comes from a human hand.<br>  They can train all day until you run out of treats!<br>  <br>  A fairly inexpensive online course with videos and stuff about Goldens is below|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	We did treat training with our Golden Retrievers, they were quick learners. They still are learning new tricks now and the are 4 years old.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It's not necessarily a bad idea, but dogs really do well with routine and predictability, so it might be best to pick one area and stick with it.  Plus...then you don't have to haul the crate around.  I crate my lab and let me tell you...that is one big and heavy crate to be moving day after day.  :)<br>  <br>  As for names, I always find it is best to meet/see the dog first.  Very easy to find a name that fits once you know their personality and quirks.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Probably best to keep the crate in one place.  Moving it around might not be so bad while it's still a puppy (if you carry it around everywhere) but when he is free to move around on his own, he could get confused if the crate is not in the same place.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	its ok to move it around but they can get confused. <br>  <br>  i would have one crate or two crates. i wouldnt move the same one everyday. that would get tiring really fast.<br>  <br>  names , Faith , Lady , Roxy , Teagan|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Nope- it is fine to move the crate around.|`|1euTfye5aa	Crate training is different for every dog.  I dont think its a bad idea but many people do.  So dont be suprised if you get negative feedback about it!   I think the puppy will enjoy being whever you are, so if you are sleeping in your room its a great idea to put the crate near you.  Just make sure the puppy is not in the crate for to long, because they need lots of excercise and play time! If you have to work during the day see if a friend or neihbor can stop by to play with the puppy and let it out to go potty.   Just from personal experience I dont crate train, I just found out it was impossible to keep a high energy dog like a doberman confined in a crate all day.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good names for girly goldens:<br>  Sadie<br>  Ladie<br>  Mazie<br>  Gracie-I really like that one!<br>  Lily<br>  Lacy|`|0LxgeSJnaa	It's best to keep it in one spot for a long time until its used to everything. Our dog loves her cage better than her crate. She has more room to move around and lay down. But we had a doggie litter pan in it and a cheap bed at first just in case she soiled it. <br>  <br>  But crate training first is easier than litter pan training. <br>  <br>  Keep the crate in one room always unless the dog is afraid of thunderstorms. Then you can move it in ur room.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	My suggestion is as follows:<br>  <br>  During the daytime, keep the crate in a central area where there is a lot of movement (the kitchen is generally where everyone gathers).<br>  <br>  At bedtime, move the crate into your bedroom, if desired.<br>  <br>  The puppy will quickly get used to this routine.<br>  <br>  Names:  Blondie, Goldie, Sunshine ...|`|7HNRs08iaa	I never had a problem moving the crate around- it is the crate that is her's not the room it is in. Just make sure it is a safe place for her with a familiar toy and blanket and do not use it as punishment- most likely she will go in all on her own after awhile. When you first bring her home- give the crate a few test runs (i.e. put her in  with the door open crawl in there yourself if you can and give lots of love- then start closing the door for 2 minutes or so at a time so she starts to learn that you will come back and open it  for her). You want to make sure that she doesn't see it as punishment just a good place for her to relax and eventually wait for you. <br>  How about Halo ( like a golden halo)|`|nFiTpDAeaa	I have known a few people that have crate trained. They kept the crate in the same place all the time. That place was usually in their living room. Puppies cry a lot, even when they are close to you in your bedreoom- then you end up giving in and bringing them into bed with you. And they still keep you up.<br>  <br>  So best bet- keep cage out of your bedroom.<br>  <br>  Its usually best to meet your pup and them chose a name. What are her strong characteristics?|`|UEHsqSaTaa	I just got a puppy and I keep it in one spot. My dog wants to see me at night so she has two crates one in my room and one in my dining room.  A good name could be ....<br>  <br>  Ginger<br>  Stella<br>  and heres a website<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topgoldenretrieversites.net/cgi-bin/database/db.cgi?tbl=Dognames" rel="nofollow">http://www.topgoldenretrieversites.net/c...</a>|`|veC6wUy9aa	I think I would keep it in the same room for now until he is crate trained.  That way he can more easily get used to it.  I've always kept mine in the same spot when crate training, and they train very fast.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	definitely don't move it you may confuse the dog|`|SR0J6Gfraa	i think its best to leave it in one place. i have 2 dogs and they trained fast when i left it in one place the times when i did move it they seemed confused and didn't want to go in the crate.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	I moved mine every where, but i can see that this may cause confusion for your pup, try it out if the pup is responding well to her/his crate training then it is fine if he/she is not then I would stick to one place.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	I think moving the crate isn't a bad idea.  I did it when training my puppy and it was part of my routine.  In the morning I would take him out then when we came back in I would put the crate in the living area while I went about my daily business.  And if I noticed my puppy had fallen asleep out of the crate I would pick him up and put him in there with the door open so he knew it was a good place to sleep and that he wasn't trapped.  In the evening as part of my going to bed routine I would put his crate in the bedroom and have him sleep in there with us.  I was told it is best to have your puppy near you at all times, so it is logical that you would move his crate.  Just make sure you do it at roughly the same times everyday and it will be fine.<br>  Most dogs are really smart and they don't confuse easily, your puppy may seem a little unsure for a day or two, but once you establish a routine she will love it.  Good luck!<br>  As for names for a female Goldy all I can think of is Goldilocks!  :D

PqT6pQAoaa	Poor water quality probably. Most fish lose color when ammonia level is high. Goldfish produce a lot of waste so i would recommend doing a water change right away. Change 40% of the water with treated water (make sure you have a dechlorinator to make the water safe)|`|ARXaNb5Daa	feed it|`|lcIUQIcnaa	it means is going to die is oxygen is really low the same is happening to my gf at the moment|`|crSqd4MPaa	It may die so you should be prepared.|`|QqeGsBauaa	either low food or the water needs purifying!
Nhje1U06aa	A holland lop is great Bread very sweet -please get it from a reputable breeder. I use a dog crate with a kitty litter box- I use yesterdays news litter. <br>  Make sure you have a cardboard box or something it can hide in .<br>  The dog crate is easier to clean.  I have a great dane one but a medium size would be fine for 1 rabbit<br>  Make sure they have plenty of timothy hay and some pellets . Water  I put velcro on the bottom of the cage and litter box . When they get older they like to move it around.  They do shed  I recommend a male, But be sure to get it fixed..<br>    my rabbits eat out of my hands . The one Roxy always follows me to the kitchen for carrots. They both love cheerios and apple slices. If I open a bannana they jump up in there cage  <br>  I let them out everyday when I get home. Roxy loves dog dry food it is not good for her , but if she'sees the dogs bowl out she goes nuts!!!    <br>  Remember they can be sweet but they are  alot of work.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	There is so much to consider when getting a rabbit they are very complicated creatures.<br>  <br>  You can email me your questions at:<br>  bunnyhelp@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  I help many people with their bunny questions and have lots of experience.|`|XI2iylR4aa	Hi, Rabbits are really great pets, but only for people who are willing to do the work involved in caring for them, and who are financially able to do so.<br>  <br>  Rabbits should be neutered to prevent accidental litters, and reproductive cancers.<br>  <br>  They must be housed indoors, they will live longer, and be better pets.<br>  <br>  They eat a lot, and need fresh veggies, so food can get expensive.  As a result of all the eating, they do poop a lot, so their litterboxes should be changed every day.<br>  <br>  They need to go to the vet once or twice a year, and if they get sick they need vet care.  That can really add up fast, but it's something to consider BEFORE getting a pet.<br>  <br>  There is way too much involved in rabbit care to go into on yahoo answers, but luckily there is a very comprehensive site at <br>  <a href="http://www.rabbit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org</a><br>  <br>  If you really love rabbits and are willing to properly care for them, they are AWESOME pets!  I love my little bunny.  She is a lop eared bun, about 6 pounds, and she is so sweet.  We play with her every day, and she makes us smile and laugh so much.  <br>  <br>  If you do get one, you should check out your local shelter or rabbit rescue first.  You can save a life.  Good luck with your decision!|`|K5F9T4vNaa	well ive had two rabbits before.  but please take into consideration i was younger about 12 or 14 when i had them.  Both had little outside hutches and that seemed to work out really well.  They wernt bad pets except they poop allllll the time. no joke i would go in everyday and be utterly shocked.  and that whole part really became a hasle.  I did take my bunny out, but i had a leash/harness for it. i know sounds rediculous. it didnt work much.  but i suggest if you do get one, make sure your comitted to it, and that you have ample space for it.  And i would chose a dwarf breed, so adorabe and really easy to cary or move !|`|zjpvZ5knaa	A pet rabbit really is not a good idea. Rabbits are not nearly as nice as they look. I have had a few friends with rabbits and they are always biting them. They end up smelling really bad b/c u cant bathe them cause they will bite you before they can get into the tub or whereever you are washing them.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Flop-Eared Rabbits are the best you could find. They live long if well cared for.<br>  Here are some items you would need:<br>  -Rabbit Food (Vegitables are fine as treats-But never as its only food)<br>  -Rabbit Cage (Make it a good size. Rabbits like being able to move.)(Or you could get too. One for outside. So when you are outside working or somthing in Spring and Summer, a Rabbit would love that.)<br>  -Dishes (For food and Water)<br>  -Chew Toys (Long wooden toys are good for rabbits that like to chew.)<br>  -Harness (Optional. Only if you cant get and outdoor Cage. Or an Outdoor cage and a walk would be nice.)<br>  <br>  Rabbits need to be fed once or Twice a Day. About once a week, you need to clean their cage. Unless you get the kind where the droppings go under a caged floor. Then you can do it more, because its easier, and it makes them happier.<br>  Try getting one young, and hold it a lot. Rabbits who are held more are more friendly and wont always run.<br>  I suggest a male rabbit. Normally I would say different, but my male flop-eared lived longer then my female. But, Im sure they could have the same longevity if they were cared for the same =3<br>  <br>  Good Luck Getting a Rabbit! They are great pets!|`|ndXmBzYlaa	rabbits are very nice. all you really need to know is how to feed them. if u got a cage for them they will be happy. you feed them carrots grain and water. at stores they have treats for them and they luv them. ive had many rabbits which live a long time. in the summer pick some weeds and they will love you.rabbits wont bite u unless ur hands don't smell like carrots. ive got a rabbit which stays small forever and his name is lulu. they r so cute i hope u get one. you will love them to death. they cuddle with u also. its cute !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|N5wmT3gsaa	I have had a pet rabbit for about a year now, and they are not easy to take care of.<br>  Rabbits need vegetables, hay, and food pellets daily. If you are going to get one, I would suggest keeping it indoors. If you have an outdoor one, he will never get used to being around people, and will probobly be more timid.<br>  I dont find that they smell, but any animal can smell if you dont look after it, and keep it's cage cleaned. You also can litter train them. There are all kinds of sites on the internet that give you tips on doing so. My rabbit has a cage, but no door. I can trust him to walk around as he pleases.<br>  Rabbits WILL CHEW WIRES!!!!!. I have lost every single wire on my computer at one time or another. Ths is dangerous because they can get electrocuted, so make sure you keep him in a place where he cant get to them.<br>  They will also have to be fixed. Females have a much longer life span when fixed, and with males.. well.. im sure you can imagine how he spends his time before he is fixed. This is also very expensive, because only a few vets know the special circumstances rabbits need for anistetic and surgery.<br>  They need things to keep them busy. You can make things out of cardboard, or the petstores sell toys for them. They do need lots of attention, and can get very sick when they arent being paid attention too. They are very social animals.<br>  The thing about cats isnt true either. My rabbit gets along fine with my cat, and he doesnt bite me at all.<br>  They will need to be taken to the vet once a year. The vet will check his teeth, which never stop growing. I have found mineral stones which he chews on, and it saves his teeth down. If his teeth grow too far, sometimes they need a surgery to get them removed. Also you will have to keep his nails trim. When I first got mine, the previous owners had never cut his nails and he could barely walk. One actually got ripped off from his cage.<br>  I know its a lot, but that is what rabbits need in order to be healthy pets. PLease dont imagine your rabbit cuddling with you, or sleeping in your bed. This is not going to happen. They hate to be held, but love to be scratched on the nose!!!<br>  All in all, i love my rabbit, and they can grow to be important members of your family! I hope this helped, and if it scared you away im sorry, but that is the reality of having a pet rabbit.|`|TCgxrttlaa	Hi! i have a rabbit and he is really lovely!<br>  <br>  he is a english dalmation rabbit they are really cute! rabbits can live up to 10 years if you keep them inside! get a indoor rabbit cage for it but make sure you let it out every day to run around for about 1hr<br>  They make wonderful pets and you can litter train them so they dont make a mess!<br>  <br>  For more information email me at... hedgehog.lover2009@yahoo.co.uk<br>  <br>  and heres a website.<br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutpets.org.uk/factsheets/rabbit/care/caring-for-your-rabbit.aspx?gclid=CIfS57TN65gCFQpNQwodtXvl0w&gclid=CIfS57TN65gCFQpNQwodtXvl0w" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutpets.org.uk/factsheet...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petwebsite.com/rabbits.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwebsite.com/rabbits.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/Advice/SmallPets/Rabbit" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsathome.com/Advice/SmallPe...</a><br>  <br>  Hope i helped<br>  <br>  Ive had lots of rabbits in the past and know alot about them|`|QmpLFdYZaa	Well to start rabbits are great pets! There really is not to much to taking care of a rabbit. The basics are: <br>  keep cage clean! clean every 2 to 3 days (male rabbits need more cleaning because of territory marking or urination) you can use bedding bought from the store such as bark chips, alfalfa, or even just shredded newspaper works.<br>  Rabbits like toys to especially wood toys to keep their teeth down because their front teeth never stop growing.<br>  And of course food and fresh clean water. hope that helps!|`|zS6s7CrDaa	well, i dont have a pet rabbit,so i dont know how to take care of them. but i know you need a good cage 4 them and if you have a cat, the bunnys a goner.but i think if you go to the pet store and ask the clerk about everything you need to know, she/he will tell you what you need to know.good luck!: )|`|6Hkuz9Tpaa	I love rabbits. they're really sweet and easier to take of than a dog. they're main diet are pellets and hay. treats are fruit and veggies. though, you'll need to buy a cage and let her outside everyday.<br>  <br>  I myself, my rabbit owns my entire back patio. I use the cage as her bathroom. I also use dog bowls to hold her food, drinks, and treats. I let her outside everyday for 1-3 hours a day. practically as long as she wants. she's been fixed, and my neighbors are happy when she runs in their backyard. she's fond of my family so she never runs on the street or side walk.<br>  <br>  I personally love rabbits
C3kq600Taa	Look around the outside of the house, really well. This happened to my cat once. She had been born a stray, and I brought in her and made her an indoor kitty, and she got out once a few months later. She didn't come for hours. I was calling her and shaking treat bags. It turned out that she was hiding in a bush right next to our house, too afraid to do anything. She eventually came to me, but it took a lot of convincing. I doubt your cat has gone very far in the outside world. Look in nearby trees and bushes, or anywhere she could be hiding outside. If you can't find her, keep leaving food out and maybe put up some signs (even if no one can catch her, if they see her and call you, you'll at least know her general location). She should come home. She's probably just frightened right now. Good luck.|`|ffHcbUeLaa	When my cats ran out, I went out calling their names with a container of cat treats, shaking it, and after a while they came back for the treats.  You can maybe walk outside in a small circle around your house with some treats shaking and calling the cat's name.  Also if the cat was wearing a collar, please double check any nearby fences - my friend's cat once got caught hanging by his collar on a spike on the fence and got barely saved (after I heard this, I now buy only snap collars for my cats).  Also check with the local shelter - maybe someone found your cat and she is there, or you can just alert them that she is lost so if someone takes her there, you can be notified.  Good luck.|`|nJ33E233aa	maybe just walk around the neighborhood with some food and call her name, hope you find her.|`|QNvBY1Wgaa	Chase it! Quick!
p3vjvzRPaa	I like KOAussie's answer.  Just to add to it, sometimes searching for a corgi club is an even better approach.<br>  <br>  Breed clubs that are affiliated to the Kennel Club usually opffer a referral service of some kind to breeders who are committed enough to the breed to be active members of a breed club.<br>  <br>  In many countries, the Kennel Club will provide you with details of any breeder who has paid a fee to be able to list themselves as a 'registered breeder'.  Not all Kennel Club's screen breeders carefully before allowing them to become registered breeders.<br>  <br>  Yes a KC registered breeder is better than an unregistered breeder, but a breeder with strong links to the breed club is likely to be better still.<br>  <br>  I've given you some links to corgi clubs/breeders in the Sources section|`|3zv2bbolaa	You can contact the KC and ask for breeder referrals to reputable breeders in the area you are seeking to purchase from.|`|P4CADDPdaa	Well, you can either buy it from a breeder or you can save a life and get one from a shelter. I don't know where you are located, so corgi's might not be popular in your surroundings. I would check a shelter first though, and if you have no luck. You can check for good breeders. A site a recommend is www.kijiji.com. It's really easy to navigate and that's where I sold my cockapoo. Good luck and make sure that you buy from a qualified breeder.|`|TBLTNbOUaa	The Queen|`|nqWvWiwZaa	erm.... a corgi shop lol sorry xx|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Have a look here and contact the nearest breed club to you for reputable breeders<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thewelshcorgiclub.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewelshcorgiclub.co.uk/</a>
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Actually, more information is needed to really assess the reason for this cat attacking, and being aggressive. There are so many reasons for a cat to behave in this manner, so without more detailed information it is hard.<br>  <br>  Have there been changes in the household? Does this happen when the cat is being petted? Sometimes cats will "attack" when over stimulated. Sometimes cats get aggressive when their environment is changed, and they are insecure and anxious. Do the children treat the cat gently or play rough with him? Is he neutered?<br>  Has he been evaluated by your veterinarian? Sometimes cats that are in pain, when touched, will "attack".<br>  <br>  So in lieu of more information to help "diagnose" the situation, here is a resource link for you to read about why cats become aggressive and how to deal with this behavior.  It is really excellent information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/tipstamingaggr_shfu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/tipsta...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck with your kitty. But do make an appointment with your vet. If it is anxiety causing this, your vet will be able to prescribe medication to calm your cat, while you are working with him. It will also rule out any medical conditions which may be at the root of the behavior.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if it is anxiety, a feliway defuser ( mimics feline calming pheromones) may help reduce his stress.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Is the cat neutered?  If not, that will make a big difference.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	1st of all you need to clip the nails...then buy something to put over its mouth so it don't bite you....after a while you see a big change in the cat....if that doesn't work.<br>  <br>  Buy another Cat so that can bully this cat cos it's soundz quite mean from the soundz of it :-(|`|G032Flc3aa	Firstly ignore Melissa, it's bad enough that her cat was mutilated please don't listen to ignorant answers like hers, it is a known fact that declawed cats can become aggressive because of the pain they are in, you would end up with a far more serious problem than you have now. <br>  <br>  You seem to have mixed the question up, first you say your friend has the cat and then you say it is your cat, I'm not sure if this question is genuine or a set up but my advice would be to have the cat neutered if not done already, keep the children away from the cat unless you are supervising them and do not allow them to maul or frighten the cat, children can do this unintentionally but nevertheless it hurts or scares cats who then retaliate by biting or scratching and end up being blamed for aggression.  Keep calm around your cat and don't shout or hit it in any way as this will make your problem worse, also you could try the Feliway diffuser which is said to calm cats, and provide her with lots of toys and scratching posts for her to play with and kick at, maybe she is just plain bored.|`|gU34xa9vaa	If you love your cat don't take Melissa's  'advice' about declawing her, it will make her defenceless and she will turn to biting instead and more than likely start messing around the house because of pain and frustration.It is actually amputating part of the cats toes, imagine having your finger and toe ends amputated.It's banned in a lot of countries anyway and soon will be banned worldwide because it's animal abuse and solves no problems at all.   <br>  As Angel says, cats do not attack for no reason, she's obviously being badly treated by someone.Find out who and teach them that cats are not toys !|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Either get rid of the cat or get rid of the family.|`|wx1WVpP5aa	Is it your cat or your friend's cat, you aren't very clear ? What are people doing to the cat to make her attack them? Children sometimes can be very rough with cats and should be taught to be gentle. <br>  Yes have the cat neutered if it isn't already, but NOT declawed as someone has done to theirs, poor thing.Putting a cat through this painful operation and crippling it would be very unkind and usually causes many more problems and the cat ends up in a rescue shelter.<br>  Cats don't attack for no reason !|`|H08vPJ2Maa	I recommend this website - the most triumphant Vicky Halls<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vickyhalls.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vickyhalls.net/</a><br>  <br>  She also has some excellent books that have loads of information about cat behaviour.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the Bill and Ted moment there!<br>  <br>  EDIT - DO NOT listen to Melissa who advocates ripping the cat's fingers out.|`|c4dny3nfaa	No man, I agree declawing would make matters worse, poor cat in mental torment and terrible pain on top, no way man.Melisa's poor cat is just a toy now to be mauled about, how cruel ! <br>  Has the bairns been hurting her do you think ? Not on purpose like as they don't know if not taught that cats are delicate and  hurt easy man. <br>  We always teach our bairns to be very gentle.|`|huEWXxmLaa	I agree, someone is hurting your cat, or if not, someone has in the past. I'd take the cat for a check up at the vets and then if all is well, just be very kind and gentle. Declawing is a VERY bad idea, to do that to a cat that already has problems is just plain cruel.|`|jauVVrzTaa	Your vet can give you some spray which really calms cats down - I think it also comes as a plug-in for around the house.|`|ufdFei1jaa	I will call over and have a word if you like.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	how many cats have we got here?
J5hsCONRaa	If you are petting the top of his head and he puts his paw on your arm to bring your hand down - it means he does not believe you are "high" enough in his pack to be granted the privelege etc of putting your hand above him. Patting his head is basically "pushing him down". Its why you shouldnt allow your dog to ever put his paws on your head, even in play.<br>  <br>  But I'm not sure if thats what you mean? My dog paws me when he needs to go out.|`|ALQuQaLGaa	It's showing love|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Our (very spoiled) dog does that when he wants me to rub his tummy instead of petting his head.|`|XavY3fiWaa	my dog does that usually when he wants attention or when he has to go outside, he will come up and have this cute look on his face(he has his moms cute rottweiler face) and he will put his paw up, its adorable.|`|V3tViL6Maa	your trust lol

You'lll also see the name Hemmingway cats, as author Ernest Hemmingway was fond of them, and had many of them on his estate.|`|AA11742268	I don't know what the name is but i have one that has 6 toes on every paw.He was a stray that came to my house  about 2 1/2  yrs ago. He is such a sweet cat. I know that doesn't answer your question but  i wasn't aware that there were many others|`|m0e3a3gWaa	Your in the fish section, but I think it is a Lynx?<br>  <br>  Edit: Ya...Im in the wrong section...:)
483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	I would not advise it, even if they chew on them, it could upset their stomachs and I doubt they would want them. If you have a birch tree, crab apple or regular apple tree, maple tree, cherry tree, oak tree or several other kinds of trees, snap them off a couple little branches from the end, set the branches in water for a couple days like in a vase and then give them those, the rabbit will love it and I would think the guinea pig would too.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	For the price of real cinnamon sticks you could probably by the chew blocks and stuff made for those pets.|`|YFTZM86maa	You can buy them cheap at craft stores and the dollar store.  They are not necessarily always food grade.  I made a broomstick out of one to go with my piggie's halloween costume.  He sniffed it but wasn't at all interested in chewing on it. Then again, he isn't much of a chewer.  If you try it, get one that has a very slight aroma.  I have never known a guinea pig to eat or chew on something that was bad for him, so if you really want to, I'd say try it and monitor well to be sure all goes well and even, perhaps, if it's something he enjoys, use for small timer periods as a special treat so he doesn't over do it.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Cinnamon sticks will be too strong for them to eat,also they mayn't be temped to chew on them. Try giving twigs,such as Apple,Pear,Ash,Willow,Hawthorn etc. Although they CAN eat Cinnamon,actual sticks aren't suitable. Oak,Cherry,Birch or Plum wood is NOT edible to rabbits or G-pigs.<br>  <br>  Sorry,xxx|`|QmpLFdYZaa	yep you can! I don't know if they will like it but it is not harmful and its simple.
QpElKY8Kaa	She's definitely got rain rot.  <br>  Big assumption here.  She's been out on pasture?  Her weight looks alright but that belly suggests worms.<br>  <br>  She may pick up all four feet but has she seen a real farrier?  The hind legs look a tad cow-hocked but that can still be mitigated  by a qualified farrier.<br>  <br>  She's not swaybacked, she's a bit downhill.  Her back is average length.  She's just shy of two?   Don't even think about riding her yet, she will be swaybacked.  Give her another year.  She's got a lot of growing and maturing to do.  Be patient and get a lot of good handling and ground work done while she's growing.<br>  <br>  If there's Arab in her, it's well hidden.  That face says QH.  It's a nice<br>  face,  A good, soft eye, shallow mouth.  Her neck is fine, it'll fill in as she matures.  She's got a good shoulder, decent pasterns, nice depth of hip.  Love the color.  She could have a place in my barn.   You can't beat the price!   Be good to her and she could be the horse you'll be telling your grand kids about.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	looks like she has rain rot on her back.  you will have to treat that.  has she been wormed yet??? she looks very young-- how old is she.  she looks like a QH cross to me.  good luck   Believe me-- its rainrot...|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I think she is a nice horse I would definitely say she is QH maybe appendix.  I don't think she has any Arab in her. She has a nice slopping shoulder.  I'll bet she is a nice mover.  Different types of horses and different builds are talented in different areas.  It always depends on what you are planing do do with her.  I think she will make you a great trail and probably gaming, or drill horse if you are into any of that.  <br>  <br>  I think working with a trainer like you mentioned is a good idea.<br>  I like her she looks like a nice horse.  Congratulations :)<br>  Jenny|`|lgaztlh8aa	Name her freebie! LOL<br>  <br>  She is cute, but she does need some tlc, and tons of brushing and a solid de-worm program, and like said before, treatment for that rain rot. If it's too cold to shampoo her, you can also use some Listerine mixed 1/2 and 1/2 with some hot water..not too hot mind you, you want to be able to soak a towel and spot treat her skin problem areas. This mix doesn't have to be washed off.  This remedy from Florida native, land-o-fungus skin conditions.<br>  <br>  It is definitely rain rot. An experienced horse person can spot that crap blindfolded. <br>  <br>  Once you get her into a grooming routine that should cease to be an issue. So many people forget that winter coats need a good firm curry everynowandthen. It helps lift off the loose hairs that hide in the coat, retain or trap moisture, and cause this fungal problem.|`|1OBjkX9vaa	she has rain rot|`|1XngLDxyaa	Well first, I don't see an ounce of arabian in her, usually a arab cross will normal have that distinctive araby head. She looks all QH. She looks like the young version of a QH I trained a couple years back. She looks to have good hip and solid leg. And a quite a bit of growing to do.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like she was started fairly well. Just take it nice and easy. Don't try to push her or yourself. And take adivse from a trainer at all turns or anytime you are hesitant on something, especially with this being your first time around with this.<br>  <br>  As for names I really am not great with that unless I know the temperment, color(hers is hard to tell from the pic), and other little things.|`|InxxEQvYaa	she has a sway back-the greatest difficulty of this is the saddle fitting<br>  is she only on hay? she has a hay belly- a good workout everyday will ease this<br>  Stick neck- may not be able to get the collection and balance you need<br>  ewe neck- (maybe) She might have a slight ewe neck, which means she may be resistant and some cooperation issues.<br>  nice angle of the shoulder<br>  Her rear end seems to be much higher than her withers, this may be the ground unlevel, saddle issues once again<br>  Do you want me to continue?<br>  Her head is ok. She has a large, soft eye(willing to trust) and a straight profile overall<br>  A short mouth may mean she will have flexibility issues(as indicated by her neck)<br>  nostrils- large and well-formed. This shows that she is intellegent, interest and active.<br>  nice large jowl=good<br>  nice flared ears, sometimes hot and energetic.<br>  <br>  Overall, she is a CUTIE pie! You may have some saddle fitting problems, and some flexibilty issues. But for a rescued pony, she is too good to be true!|`|MUfMJYHGaa	It's hard to tell from the pictures, but you can see some arab in her head. If her legs aren't horribly crooked and you like her personality, the price is right. But don't expect her to get too big. She seems a little short for a 2 yr old.But I like short horses. They're easier to get on! And if you have good help, you can train her yourself.Work wit her awhile. She'll tell you her name.Get her wormed ASAP  Rainrot is not a big issue. Use a fungicide shampoo like Microtek  Get the vet out before you take her in case there is something so awful you can't deal with it. Don't take her because you feel sorry for her, it's a big job and it's harder to get rid of a problem than to take one on. Take her because you can do something with her|`|YdJgrgvdaa	i would say she is a little overwheight, i know she is not beibg ridden yet but try giving er less grass/hay when you get her, i knoe you were told she has arab in her but i don't see it.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Personally I think she's adorable :) You can't expect the horse to be in perfect condition if they're free. It does look like she has some sort of problem with the skin on her back, but I'm not an expert on that sort of thing. And I can see a little bit of Arab in there, even though she's definatley not full. No ideas on names, I'm not very good at that sort of thing.
IMPvzBk1aa	I would keep her moving, in addition to assuring that she is drinking plenty of water.  Exercise will help to stimulate the muscles of her intestines to propell the feces along.  I would definitely call the vet and let him/her know that no feces has been passed.  The effects of Banamine can last longer than you may think, especially if more than one dose has been given.  It is possible that it may be masking the painful signs and symptoms normally seen when a horse is colicking.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	i have no experience with anything like this but if you are still worried tomorow get the vet back out|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	if she is eating she needs to pass manure. if it were one of my horses id call the vet and tell him what is happening. id also take the hay away,perhaps give her a handful or 2 of alfafa and def. no grain.  maybe even walk her half hour twice a day ,if she is confined to a stall. best advice --call your vet.  good luck..|`|AA10776535	I had a horse colic, vet came out did her thing and all seemed well...Two days later he had been eating and drinking water...I had been down there all day working...I look over at him and something didn't seem right...then down he went...there were several other people with me down there and we got him up...Now this whole thing took no more than 7 minutes...I called the vet right away screaming in a panic, she had been there a the day before just to check up on him, she said he was all good...before anything could be done he died.  You do not want this happening to you, i nearly shut down this rescue because of it, he is the first horse in my 30 ok more like 40 years of having horses that died, i was traumatized.<br>  Call the vet....|`|DLxh9CANaa	Before you panic, I want you to try an old, sure fire way to get a horse to poop. If you have a horse trailer on your property, load the mare into it, and take her for a ride down the road a ways. By the time you turn around and head home, I guarantee you she'll have pooped in the trailer, because that's what EVERY HORSE does. The other thing you need to do is make sure your mare MOVES- that means you need to get on her and ride her, or longe her. Exercise will help get the circulation going again and stimulate her gut, which in turn will lead to her pooping and hopefully, passing the impaction on her own. I'm surprised your vet didn't mention this, in fact. You should have seen some signs of oil coming through her system within 8 to 12 hours after she was treated with it- it frequently appears as a fine sheen on the tail or rectal area. Oil which is used this way also has a HEAVY SMELL which is easy to detect- again, your vet should have told you to watch for this. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'd give the mare a bran mash or some really WET beet pulp a few times ( you can add salt to both bran and to the pulp, to encourage your mare to drink more water) and continue to moisten her hay until you see signs that she's making manure in a normal manner. Instaed of squirting oil into your mare's mouth, why not add it to her bran mash or to beet pulp? It will get into her a LOT more easily that way. Turning the mare out is an excellent idea- just be sure to keep an eye on her, in case she starts feeling uncomfortable again. <br>  <br>  Good luck- I hope this helps you. Try the old trailer ride trick before you do anything else, though- it REALLY WORKS- and I know this from personal experience.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I cannot beleive the vet could not get oil down her.  I have never seen a horse you can't do this to.  Knocking them out and/or a twitch always works.  I am surprised he did not try other methods.  Anyway, it is possible it was gas "colic".  The small amount of oil you give is not going to do a thing for her.  She need a couple gallons.  Anyways, if she is eating okay, she is probably alright.  However,  you have her in a small area or at least alone, so if she poops you know its her?  She should be passing poop everyday about a dozen times average.  Banamine will only mask pain, it does not cure.  It is possible that's why she is not pooping. Not likely, but the possibility is there. Don''t give her any grain until she is back to normal. Make sure she has loads of water, try making a bucket of tepid water with molassas to make her drink.|`|kwhfazx7aa	Hi,<br>  I would re-contact the vet.  If your horse is eating normally then she should be passing manure (on average a horse will pass manure 12 times per day).  No hard feeds as mentioned forage only. Light exercise may help but if worried call your vet.<br>  I hope she's Ok good luck.|`|5kUxkun3aa	i would get your horse back in. you need to be able to keep a close eye on her. my horse had colic a few years ago,it took her 4 days to go. we only gave her bran mash. nothing that would bung her up. the vet removed even her bedding so she couldn't eat the straw. <br>  i don't think putting her out to grass was a good idea. <br>  mine wasn't used to been in.<br>  when she finally went we had a party!!|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Make sure the horse is drinking. The most frequent cause of colic is not drinking. Banamine is a pain-killer anti-inflammatory and won't help with that. Not sure about the oil, but hay and water are the most important two things to be making sure she's consuming.<br>  <br>  Update your vet on the situation every day. If you are not getting the advice that you are comfortable accounts for the situation (for instance, does the vet expect the lack of defecation and know how long will it continue?), I would seek a second opinion.<br>  <br>  Exercise may also help, so if you are keeping her in a stall, try to turn her out.<br>  <br>  If at all possible, if you are in winter conditions, get her water heated and keep it from freezing over.<br>  <br>  Passing gas is good and if you put an ear to her chest you should also hear the intestinal sounds.<br>  <br>  Best wishes - I hope she comes out just fine!|`|MUfMJYHGaa	That small amount of oil won't do much good. If the mare is eating and standing,try this old trick. Small meals such as a bran mash ,chopped carrots or grass hay wet ted down. Sprinkle a little salt to encourage drinking. She needs moisture in her gut to help move things along. Put her out on the lawn for a half hour at a time. You don't want to shove too much in her all at once because if she has a blockage or stone the pressure will make her act colicky again Keep her off grain.If you have psyllium,try to get some in her ,it's supposed to help move sand out. If her gut is functioning you will probably see manure by tonight. If she continues to colic between shots you may have a serious problem that the banamine is masking. Check her breath and her gas. If they are really sour, she is having problems. But if they are" horsey sweet" things are probably moving along  Keep in touch with your vet and keep an eye on her until she is normal|`|S78sVWEVaa	Sounds like a sorry halfa$$ vet. <br>  <br>   Call someone more competent.  A decent vet would have been able to get a gallon of oil followed by a gallon of water into that horse.<br>  Here's a rule of thumb, never feed a colicked horse until they've had at least one normal bowel movement.  Your horse is blocked, stop adding to the problem.<br>  <br>  Keep the horse moving, WALK IT.  Her vitals may have been good two days ago, I'll bet they're not now.  She needs to be well hydrated, is she drinking?<br>  <br>  Keep standing around doing nothing and you won't have a horse to watch.|`|lgaztlh8aa	Do you or someone you know have a horse trailer? Loading them always brings on a dump. Also, try walking up and down some inclines, or hills. I live in Florida where it's quite flat, even a slight incline like in and out of a ditch works. It helps stretch the topline and belly muscles to get things moving.<br>  <br>  Do you have the horse stalled? Maybe if you turn it out then nature will take it's course, especially if it isn't accoustomed to being kept in.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
PNLNewgQaa	I have an african gray and her name is scooter. When she first started to talk her first thing was to click and now she does it all the time.  You must remember this is just a noise they have picked up and they like it. African are one of the most smartest birds there are. I did have an afican gray before this one her name was molly, but she got an eye disease they have not found a cure for yet. so when she passed on we went to varieties and they gave us another bird who is scooter. scooter makes clicking sound and sometimes really loud ones but she uses this sound with her surroundings sometimes. scooter was a very frightened bird she was left in the birdshop too long, and not much but the same thing everyday. now she is doing better she used to be afraid for any one to touch her now i have her sining and dancing and repeats ANYTHING she heres.  now molly did those noises because she could make the noise. she enjoyed to sing and do things from the beginning she was a very happy baby when i got her.  So, you see, let birds make noise even if it sounds weird because they are only learning how to talk, sing, or etc. they malk anything they here and are very smart. so you have a smart bird. thank you!|`|A2G9foewaa	Because you have been watching the movie "the gods must be crazy" too much around it|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	He's heard it somewhere and is mimicking it, most likely :)|`|vjijiJT3aa	she's communicating with you click back and add some words in.|`|ZPYZQxjkaa	My love bird does that and it's nervousness. I make the noises back at him and he gets a kick out of it.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-She is practicing her sounds.  Like a small child, they learn by mimmicking, and need to 'practice' using their vocal cords to figure out how they work.|`|WIhaOOeNaa	maybe when you type on the computer he picked it up from that<br>  cuz you do it alot every day
LVsE65jiaa	try some cat food that is for indoor cats and indoor weight control. we had to put our cat on that after she was fixed and it has helped tremendously. also, ask the vet. if the vet feels she is over weight they might have some different suggestions. but, the indoor cat food has more fiber in it. hope this helps.|`|xq2J2LMSaa	Make sure you play lots with your kitty!<br>  Exercise helps them, just like it helps us. Not to mention, it'll make all of you feel good and create a closer bond.<br>  Girl cats usually get a little dangle of skin below their bellies which isn't fat, so don't worry if that doesn't go, but they also tend to get chubby, too ;)<br>  The indoor cat food is a good idea, too. It shouldn't cost extra.|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	Try to get her to play and run around more (this requires your participation also). Some (lots) cats just get that way so all I can say is love her the way she is Don't tell her she is fat, tell her she has metabolism issues instead. LOL.|`|0zriLTZXaa	There are some types of cats that are born fat and that is how she is supposed to be.

As long as her bowel movements are normal, however many times she wants to go a day is just fine.|`|XavY3fiWaa	Once a day for a maltese is probably good, but i'm not sure though, try going to www.petpeoplesplace.com and see if your question is on there.|`|evnj2DUpaa	About two or three times a day.

o93EwErKaa	Panting and shivering could be first signs of labor.  You take her temperature rectally using a water soluble lubricant such as KY Jelly.  You don't have to insert the tip very far.  You take the temperature twice a day while she is at rest.  If you see a spike then a drop down to the low 98s she will be giving birth in the next 24 hours.<br>  <br>  This website has a lot of good information and contains a temperature taking article and many others that will be helpful to you.<br>  www.debbiejensen.com|`|3giaPYe8aa	Go to the drug store and purchase a digital thermometer.  Take her temperature, rectally.  When/if her temp is 99 degrees or a little below that, she should go into active labor in around 12-24 hours.  Panting and shivering are the first signs.  I hope you have a proper whelping box with a pig rail ready for the whelping.  Don't let her go potty outside by herself...she could "drop" a pup outdoors.  Always take her out on a leash and have a towel and scissors with you, just in case.  Keep the Vet's telephone # nearby in case you see any distress or contractions that last more than an hour, without producing a pup.  Count placentas....there should be one for each pup produced.  Take her to the Vet for a post whelping checkup about 24 hours after she is finished.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Your question rings alarm bells for me.<br>  <br>  If you suspected she was pregnant why didn't you get her spayed before now, or just checked out by the vet?  (Then you would have got the advice you are now asking us for)<br>  <br>  And if she's a stray why do you call her a maltese?  She may be a cross breed that looks like a maltese.<br>  <br>  And people don't usually 'get' a dog as a stray.  They 'find' a stray, or 'adopt' a stray.<br>  <br>  All sounds a bit odd to me - like maybe you're not being honest with us.<br>  <br>  Maybe I'm being paranoid!  There are lots of weirdos on this site.  <br>  <br>  I'll set all that aside and assume you are a genuine caring dog owner.<br>  <br>  Taking her temperature is more useful if you have been tracking her temperature for a while so that you know what is normal for her (it can vary - eg I have a healthy dog with a lower than normal temperature).  It will drop 12-36 hours before whelping so if it's already dropped you may not be able to tell.<br>  <br>  You take a dog's temperature with a rectal thermometer.  <br>  <br>  Dogs can pant because they are in pain, same with shivering.  But yes these can be signs of whelping too (my dogs don't shiver.  They pant and start nest building)<br>  <br>  I suggest you take her to the vet to check all is well and get their advice on how far from whelping she is.|`|z2mpC5NDaa	you will notice her trying to find somewhere secluded...... providing you have a whelping box ready for her...............always have a vet number handy that you can call in case there is any trouble...they try to find somewhere they feel safe, and quiet, and out of the way.....she will lose most of her appetite and not drink too much, so don't worry...... if you can, give her some old towels and blankets, and put them in a corner where it is quiet and she will feel safe...... she wont want to move around when the babies start coming........ make sure you are there when she gives birth incase she has trouble and you may need to assist her or the babies.............|`|Bw18seFqaa	the vet should have given you an estimate due date when he confirmed the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  You take her temperature rectally..  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/how-to-take-your-dog-s-temperature/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/how-to-take...</a>|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you have to take her temp in her butt. but that isnt that accurate in my experience.<br>  <br>  your dog will find a spot and not move. she will begin to pant alot and look like she is having anxiety.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	You should have her aborted and spayed and not bring more unwanted pups into this world.

T864ejaiaa	you can go to your vet and get flea drops you put on the back of his neck. it will last for 30 days and you'll have to get another dose. the vet should have a pill that will kill all the fleas in 24 hours. that way your pet will be flea free. if you bath your cat before putting the drops on you'll have to wait 4 days after the bath to treat. good luck.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	fleas can hope a ride on you or your clothes into your house.  just because your cat is indoors doesn't mean that it will never get fleas, it has less of a risk than an outdoor cat.<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER put a flea collar on an animal, those things will make your cat sick and possiably kill them.  <br>  <br>  get your cat to the vet or at least call the vet and get some flea stuff from them NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER get something from a petstore or another store, those things have been known to kill animals.<br>  <br>  you will need to treat your house for fleas as well to get rid of them all.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Flea collars and flea baths CAN sicken cats!

And I've had very good luck with Zodiac with all my other many many many kitties. <br>  The only things I have used that "seem" to be safe is something like REVOLUTION, ADVANTAGE (tube flea applications) and Sentry Natural Defense (cheaper). So far, cross my fingers, they have been safe. But with any product, WATCH YOUR KITTY CAREFULLY!!!!! Cats can go downhill VERY fast when something like this poisons this. If they act different, such as sleep more, not want to eat or any other weird thing then get them to the vets F-A-S-T!<br>  Personally if I can afford it, Revolution works the best.<br>  <a href="http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Animals.html" rel="nofollow">http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...</a>|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Flea collars can do more harm than good.

You can buy it at Petco or Petsmart or through your vet. You apply it to the back of the neck - part the hair. Apply once a month. <br>  <br>  It worked for my indoor kitty who got fleas from the dog. They are bad this year.|`|LVsE65jiaa	bathe him with pert plus. it kills adult fleas instantly. it does not kill the eggs but if you bathe him every few weeks you will eventually not see any fleas. just let it sit for a minute or two and they will rinse off in the water. also try crushing a garlic tablet in his food sometime. garlic is a natural thing that sends pests on their way.|`|xq2J2LMSaa	He probably got them from YOU! You might have brought them in from outdoors on your pants (flea eggs are sticky).<br>  Revolution is good--it's just a drop on your cat's neck once a month, and it kills both adult and baby fleas. Flea collars are also a good way to keep fleas away.|`|vtkuEr5Kaa	SHAVE HIM NUDE.<br>  <br>  Completely.<br>  <br>  Or flea baths, combs, and professional flea treatments work, too.<br>  <br>  Whatever you find more in your budget.

o93EwErKaa	This is true to some extent, but they are now making Large Breed Puppy food.  If the puppy food states it is for a large breed than the protein and calcium content, etc. has been formulated for a large breed and it will not be a problem.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to some of the large breed puppy foods available.  Click on the individual food to see how it rates on a scale from 1 to 6 with 1 being the lowest.  If you have a Great Dane or xlarge dog you might want to do a search for giant breed puppy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/showcat.php?cat=all&stype=1&si=large+breed+puppy" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a>|`|3giaPYe8aa	Yes, it is true...you"ll just have to trust me on this one.  It really doesn't slow their growth, it just has a lower protein and fat content, which IS better on the joints of a developing large breed puppy.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	Puppy food contains a higher protein ratio than adult dog food.  The reason for that is to develop healthier bones and provide their bodies with the energy it takes for their bones and teeth to grow in a healthy way.  Just think of it this way.  You don't feed a human baby adult food while they are developing and growing.  There are special formulas for a reason.|`|AA11244754	Most vets generally recommend PUPPY FOOD when they are puppies because there are more nutrients in the puppy food.  I suggest you get a second opinion from a GOOD vet because that one sounds like a quack!|`|QvxUDjdGaa	no  if they are a puppy they need food for a puppy, if they are an old dog then they need old dog food. You cant risk a animals health.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	Its up to you but I have always stuck with puppy chow|`|iXijnCxOaa	Yes.  Large and Giant breed pups should either be fed a "Large Breed Puppy" formula food (which is essentially a more costly adult food) or they should be fed adult formula.<br>  <br>  I raw feed my dogs ~ so I feed them the same as pups that I do as adults... the pups just eat significantly more.<br>  <br>  Edit: Slow, steady growth and keeping the puppy from getting overweight decreases the incidence of orthopedic issues.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	My puppy is a German Shepherd/ Collie and the regular dog food did stunt her growth, but it also gave her a weight problem (she didn't gain like she should have). I guess it would be ok, but if you notice any serious side affects, than switch to the puppy chow.|`|PwvVoWFYaa	No!!! You would not give a baby adult food just because the baby is a large baby. pupies like babies need have special diet needs. they do have dog food for Larger breed puppies!  You can look at petsmart and ask someone who works there what the best food for your puppy might be their employees tend to be very helpful and informative. Or at least in my experiance! <br>  hope I could help|`|AA10236778	A puppy is a puppy no matter how big it is, puppy food has vital ingredients that are crucial to their developement.|`|NS6PJlDraa	puppies need certain vitemin especially those those with protein....the adult dog food doesnt have as much..you would give a baby adult food woule you...?|`|C4ixnBzSaa	NO! You was talking to a somewhat Nutty Vet! Better find you a new one!|`|DQkDQraOaa	Call your vet and ask. I don't think it is good for a puppy's belly or teeth.|`|EFS3VK3waa	I don't think so, it might be rough on their teeth.|`|S3w9utVEaa	That reccommendation is for large breed dogs who may develop hypotrophic osteodystrophy, which is a condition related to a reaction to vaccinations and/or too high of a protein content in the puppy food( usually anything over 28%) that causes a rapid growth in puppy bones and strains the joints. It is wise to keep your dog on a large breed puppy formula like solid gold, wellness holistic, canidae or nutro. They are expensive but are better for the puppy. Purina is ok too for their development. Some large breed dogs may actually carry the gene directly for HOD, all large breeds are genetically predisposed to having HOD bc they are large dogs that grow so fast as puppies. That's why your vet recommended this. If you have another small or medium sized breed dog, I would absolutely not worry about that and definitely keep him on puppy food. If you have a large breed and are having growth rate problems, it would be good to keep him on a 23-26% protein puppy food and mix it with adult dog food with a lower protein content. You do not want to give a developing puppy adult food alone. Puppy food has nutrients for their developing puppy brains that are essential to their growth and other ingredients for their immune system that they will not get from adult dog food alone. Essentially puppies need this food to thrive and grow properly in brain and body. So NO do not take your puppy off of puppy food completely. Also, pet stores carry treats from Authority that are specifically for DHA puppy brain/immune system development to help to sub when you are having to give your puppy a half and half mix of adult dog food. If your puppy has these problems only give the dog food mix like this for 2 months. Your puppy should be on puppy food until he/she is 13 months old.|`|XPcnHs7Iaa	Feeding a high protein "puppy" type food can increase the risk of panosteitis. So, yes, feeding an adult food is the best choice. This is a good question.  Most people don't realize the pano risk, so they just buy into the marketing and feed puppy food which is too high protein for giant breeds.|`|7ObD9tNbaa	yes, but it may be a good idea to feed it puppy food, it's made for healthier development while they grow, but if you only have adult food, it wont hurt.|`|MWJOEikkaa	Yes, it is true in some large breeds. Also do not let pup get over weight
IMPvzBk1aa	A horse can carry somewhere between 20% and 35% of its own weight, depending on several factors.  First, the most important factor is the depth, width, and length of the horse's loin. <br>   Second is the correctness of the horse's joint angles.  Then the build of the rider comes into play.  Is it a long, tall person whose weight will be distributed more evenly over a larger area, and more balanced?  Or is the rider built more like a round ball, with most of the weight teetering on the horse's back, with short limbs that don't assist much in balance and even weight distribution? <br>  In order to determine whether your friend would be too heavy for one of your horse's, all of these factors would be important to consider<br>  Then you take into account the weight of the saddle and any additional gear.  Will the horse just be ridden for pleasure, or be performing any athletic endeavors like jumping?  <br>  Think of John Wayne, John Candy, and Wayne Newton.  All are  (or were) big men weighing 300lbs or so.<br>   Wayne Newton breeds and rides Arabians.  But Arabians typically have wide short backs, strong loins, and dense bones.  They are typically capable of carrying more weight than other breeds of similar weight because of their conformation.<br>  So the height of the horse isn't what matters so much as these other factors.  The problem may be in determining your friend's weight without asking outright.  Good luck.  Err on the side of caution.|`|lgaztlh8aa	When they are heavy and unfit, and so is the horse. <br>  <br>  Actually there are a lot of factors in considering this question. A 15hh horse who is physically fit is capable of carrying upward around the 250lb mark...given that the 250lb or over rider isn't just a passenger and flopping all over the poor beasts back. If a heavy rider is capable and can keep their seat and move with the horse then it isn't that big a deal.<br>  <br>  Ever watch a reining competition or a cutting event? Those horses are usually on the smaller end of the horse spectrum, but the riders can be large, tall men. The horses have no problem manuvering because the rider knows what they are doing.<br>  <br>  If your friend is a beginner, I would say no, but offer to teach her how to ride properly and start her out on a line at the walk and help her get fit. Who know, she may catch horse fever, lose weight and buy a horse!|`|KMMK6RZSaa	The general rule of thumb is that a horse shouldn't carry much more than 20% of their total body weight.  This includes tack.  So, a 1200 pound horse can comfortably carry up to 240 pounds (tack+rider).|`|Xobbmd7Saa	A 15h horse shouldn't carry much more than 200 pounds....If the horse is older even less and so on. If they are too heavy, Just politely tell them they can't ride and don't give them a reason.|`|YdJgrgvdaa	i would say any1 bigger than 15 stone but it depends on the horse, because cobs can carry more weigh than say an Arab|`|FcR8G8hPaa	There's no hard and fast rule. A 15 hand horse may weigh 1100-1200 lbs, 300 lbs is 25% of that. A backpack that weighs 25% of a similarly athletic 180lb man would be 45 lbs - not an outrageous weight for a human.<br>  <br>  But a poorly balanced 300 lbs on that horse could be a lot more uncomfortable. Poorly balanced and in the wrong saddle could be more uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that if your friend is 300+ish pounds, then watch as she mounts up and see how the horse reacts. If the horse seems uncomfortable. find a nice way to tell your friend about how small your horse is and ask her to dismount or at least limit the ride time. If not, just keep an eye on things.<br>  <br>  For a very heavy person, a mounting block can also help the horse, as it will reduce the torque of the saddle twisting when the rider mounts.<br>  <br>  Overwieight people can ride just as well as anyone. Some of the top reiners are pretty heavy looking. Don't ruin a friendship or take away from your friend's chance to enjoy riding (which might become a lifelong athletic passion), but do keep an eye on things and be careful.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	It depends on the horse's weight. Obviously it's going to be a different answer depending on if it's a light Arab or a heavy Clydesdale, y'know? I believe there actually is a formula for figuring out whether or not someone is light enough to ride a horse...a certain percentage of the horse's weight or something. You can probably google it.<br>  Edit- I see the person above me already wrote it.|`|1XngLDxyaa	The horses build really make the difference. Large solid strong leg and fit 25%. If a more fine legged/ light boned horse such as a Thoroughbred and such 20% is a better judge. BUT this actually does not apply so much to Arabians, they actually can easily carry 30-35%. I know it sounds off but with being their physically shorter backs , one less vertebrae. They actually can carry more weight, but this means the horse has to be in  very good shape and sound.|`|CIGMY2GTaa	Well, to answer your question, I know someone who rides 13 hand ponies for long cantering rides. He weighs 220 by himself, not including tack. People are rarely actually too heavy to ride horses.|`|YkseyT7zaa	When the horse whinnies "No F**king Way!
TTLIp8Beaa	it depends on the show.<br>  some shows require you to have different numbers for different horses, some don't. <br>  if you do have to change numbers fast, i suggest getting show number saddle pads. that way you can have the number on the right horse and you don't need to worry about changing them. i'm not positive if they make a western version, but they might. <br>  english:<br>  <a href="http://www.forthehorseofcourse.com/blankets-pads/Saddle%20pad%20shown%20w-saddle-l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.forthehorseofcourse.com/blank...</a><br>  western sort of?:<br>  <a href="http://showmags.com/images/HorseSaddle1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://showmags.com/images/HorseSaddle1....</a><br>  <br>  also, you can always tie your number around your stomach, instead of pinning it to the back of your jacket. always make sure your string color matches your coat color as close as possible. but if you keep your number on each saddle pad then you won't have a problem.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|KRa6p3Anaa	Usually you have a different number per horse.  If you know which order you will be showing the horses - tie the numbers on in order underneath each other - so the first horse's number is on top of the 2nd horse's number, etc .. then once you've shown the first horse just take his number off to reveal the number of the 2nd horse tied underneath and you are ready to go.
p3vjvzRPaa	A puppy doesn't normally smell bad, unless you're just not used to normal dog smells.<br>  <br>  It's not a bad idea to take a new pup to your vet anyway, so why not ask about this when you're there.  <br>  <br>  Also perhaps talk to the breeder.<br>  <br>  Skin, teeth, ear, eye problems can all cause smells - I know this from my own dogs.

Dogs faces and ears are commonly missed at bathing time, and over time can start to keep that stank to em.<br>  <br>  If the body is stinky, buy liquid ivory dish detergent. Dilute it to about 1/4 inch in the bottom of a 1litre bottle. Shake well. Use as a shampoo. Be sure to rinse out very well. The best way to rinse a dog is to get a portable shower head. They cost less then 10 dollars. If this is not possible make sure to dump a lot of buckets of water on him to get him squeeky clean.<br>  <br>  You should blow dry your dogs ears after bath time, as moisture can allow bacteria to grow in the ears.|`|5W0vBgvWaa	Good luck with that one.

It comes with the breed.<br>  <br>  That said, have the vet check him over for problems, such as ears, anal glands, skin infections, lip fold infections, tooth problems etc. <br>  <br>  Look at what you are feeding him.  Many Basset owners report a reduction in the odor when switching to a corn-free food.<br>  <br>  If the dog is yeasty, you can try a disinfecting shampoo/soap, and DRY VERY WELL.

I doubt they'll let you have the licking water bottle type.<br>  <br>  You MUST have two dishes, one for food, one for water, or one dish with a divider that attaches to the door, JUST IN CASE there are problems and the airline crew has to provide sustenance to your dog.  With an international flight, I suspect it's going to be a long one, and your dog WILL need to be fed and watered.<br>  <br>  Ultimatley, you should call your chosen airline, they can tell you ALL The specific information you need, and all the requirements you must meet.|`|nFiTpDAeaa	You will need to find out the shipping regulations with the airlines. There is quite often a maximum size allowed for crates. And all the airlines are different from one another.<br>  <br>  How long is your flight? If it is quite long, and you must include the water bottle, there is no need to train him on it. Just show him it before you leave. He will not drink much at all in flight. How much do you drink when you fly? Not much usually. <br>  <br>  If you need not worry about the size restrictions of the crate on the airline, the technical way of sizing is:<br>  <br>  The dog needs just enought space to be able to stand up and turn around in. If there is too much space in the crate, they can begin to feel upset. And conversely, if there is not enough space to even stand up in, then they can begin to feel cramped in too tiny of quarters.|`|0zcL5YNkaa	Well, I own an adult male Labrador and he has a large igloo. <br>  Likely that size should work, if not you feeling too good on this decision, you can always consult a provider of kennels say from PetSmart or Petco.

x8Vgu6acaa	Check out consumer reports.  they recommend the Hoover Steam Vac with Clean Surge.  F5914 - 900  A couple of other sights recommended it also,  I just bought it on sale for $149.00 @ Best Buy.  I haven't used it yet.  It is about half the price of having my carpets cleaned.  Also,  on the web you can find recipes for homemade solutions to use for different problems.|`|3giaPYe8aa	This is what we use.  We have a Bissell Steam Cleaner with the upholstery attachment.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  "Punks"? I think they are sleeping in "funky" positions. Actually lots of cats love to lay on their backs and stretch out.  A cat that is exposing their belly to a human, is demonstrating trust in their environment, as it is a very vulnerable position.<br>  <br>  More about this is available at: <br>  <a href="http://sandra-fortheloveofcats.blogspot.com/2007/07/let-sleeping-cats-lie.html" rel="nofollow">http://sandra-fortheloveofcats.blogspot....</a><br>  <br>  You can read all about sleeping habits as well.<br>  <br>  Great photos you picked, by the way.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association.|`|QvxUDjdGaa	they think they are Kool kats|`|ERXFkpxKaa	When they expose their belly like that it means they are trusting and content.

C4ixnBzSaa	If she is sick and hasn't had a fever in a week she probably doesn't have Parvo. I raised, trained and raced Greyhounds for many years and I have had several litters of puppies catch parvo, but I have never seen puppies or grown dogs with parvo that didn't have a fever. Another thing about parvo, most dogs don't last a week. But remember that parvo is AIRBORN, so it's possible. Get your dog back to the vet, and use lots of Clorox every place he's been. Good Luck!|`|L22hVXTIaa	Fortunately, I've never had a dog with Parvo, but from what I understand the symptoms can vary a little from dog to dog, with horrendous diarrhea being sort of the hallmark of the disease.  If you don't trust your vet's diagnosis, get a second opinion.  But my vet told me that  dogs can get Parvo from just smelling an infected dog's feces.|`|oHV95EFLaa	i've had a few dogs with parvo. my vet said my dalmation got it from the dirt at our house so she was a carrier and it never effected her but any dog she bite became sick if they hadn't gotten their shots. they would become tired, lethargic, and they had diarrhea. they couldn't keep ANY food or drink down, and they just kept getting worse and would die. there are dogs that survive it, but none of mine did. she'll need water injected under her skin to keep her hydrated and i don't think there's much treatment besides that|`|zBH33xb5aa	my dog was a year old when she got parvo, my buddy had a puppy without shots, his puppy died. my dog just didn't want to move one morning, she didn't even want her ball which told us there was something wrong. we just got her, was told her shots were up to date, the vet said she probably didn't get her 1 year shot and that's why she got it, she must have got her puppy shots though so we were able to save her. the vet wanted to keep her for 10 days, we couldn't afford $100 a day so he let us take her home with some medicine. wherever she puked or peed we had to wash that area with bleach to kill the virus. she made it through, this happened 10 years ago now so the memory is a little foggy, i think it took about a week or so for her to come back. we used to give her a little bit of dairy queen ice cream, we'd leave a little on the stick for her it was her favorite treat, we used the ice cream stick and put a little of the special diet food on it to get her to start eating. it's a quick killer though, i believe if she didn't see a vet right away, she wouldn't have made it through the week.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	We had a dog that had parvo and it we couldn't figure out how she got it because she was the only dog that had ever been in our back yard. Come to find out that the parvo virus can live in the yard for awhile. It can be spread by rodents and even insects. It is an extremely deadly virus and kills hundreds of dogs each year. I would suggest getting a second opinion if you have any doubts about your current veterinarian.<br>  Whatever you do, do it right away!|`|F5vw66EJaa	My dog had it like four or five years ago.  I did not know here exact symptoms but I knew she was sick.  She was running a fever.  She would not eat.  Her behavior changed, like she was not as playful. She was really lazy like she would barely move. Over all she just looked sick. Here is a website below that helps you understand what happens to Parvo.   <a href="http://www.workingdogs.com/parvofaq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.workingdogs.com/parvofaq.htm</a><br>  I hope everything works out for you. Good Luck.|`|sema7Hesaa	If your Vet says it parvo then most likely it is...If your still not satisfied with the Vets answer then do your research on the internet for signs of parvo..I know that diarreah with blood, vomiting, and rapid lose of weight are symptoms of parvo..<br>  Good Luck :-)|`|TfHdQHR7aa	Yyou can buy special food that will HELP cure the parvo at petco or petsmart, if you dont think the vet is doing enough take your pet for a second opinion.<br>  & Sorry i couldnt be of more help, my friends dog had parvo not mine..|`|AA11823705	Did your Doc run a parvo test?

Parvo is a severe digestive disease, causing sickness firstly, then diarrhea which will eventually turn bloody. Weight loss and bloating in the stomach. Dehydration and eventually death. Sadly there is no cure for parvo, but some dogs can recover with antibiotics and an IV drip to rehydrate but not many. Her temperature needs monitoring to watch for any increase. Is she eating? Is she moving her bowels? Is it possible she has eaten a foreign object that has become stuck? If this is likely then you can try some vegetable oil to work as a laxative. Hope things work out for you|`|o93EwErKaa	The parvo virus lives a long time on surfaces so she could have been infected.  You can also go to a dog park or Petsmart and bring the virus home on your shoes or clothing.<br>  <br>  My experience with parvo has been severe diarrhea with blood and mucous.  The dog will not eat or drink anything.  You can even offer a dog a tasty morsel of chicken and he will run away.  They have to be force fed liquids to keep from dehydrating.  If you dog has been vaccinated, sometimes they get a lighter case and the symptoms are not as severe.  <br>  <br>  They need fluids (Pedialyte) by mouth every hour, subcutaneous fluids or iv fluids depending on the severity of the illness.  They need antibiotics to keep from developing secondary bacterial infections since the lining of the stomach sloughs off (the mucous and the blood in the poo).  Vets are also now prescribing Tamiflu with success.  The most informative site for parvo is www.ambertech.com  I have used their Parvaid and Vibactra Plus with great success on many shelter dogs.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Has your vet analyzed a stool sample for coccidia?  If not have this done.  Here is a link to coccidia.<br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+1622&aid=727" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a>|`|NIHXUmN1aa	We had a puppy with parvo...he started throwing up, the vet ran a test and said he had parvo...he kept him for about 3 or 4 days and he got better in that time....now he's going on 2 years old

Please take better care of your dog. And like everyone else says - get this dog back to the vet - a different vet. Has it been tested for heartworms? Or distemper? Heartguard is for heartworm prevention - not for fleas and ticks! And you should never give it to your dog unless your dog has had a heartworm test that has come back negative. You need to find a new vet.

Silly goose, cat can scent when their owner loves them.  When a owner, pay a lot of attention to their cat, they will always be followed and cared for at all time.  Animals have a very good instinct, and it is in our trade to protect the people we love.  For years, in Egypt even now in Rome.. Cats are well respected, and known as protector from evil spirits.  Animals also can scent danger, and if you watch carefully, they will be the first to alert you.  <br>  But if you brush them, feed them, and change their litter in a household, they will follow you everyday.  If you where to move from one room to another, likely you will find them with you.  I find this as a comfort, and I treasure my time with them.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I suspect he loves you deeply. It is good you are worried he is sick. But in this case I doubt it. I had a cat, Lucas, who was born in 1989.

He would run across the floor and jump way up into my arms, fetch, do somersaults, kiss me constantly, drink coffee from my cup and just act more like a puppy than a cat. Oh how I miss my Kittypup.

L22hVXTIaa	Gee, I always thought marriage was a partnership.   Sounds like your husband was playing nice guy and agreed to a dog - until you actually found one, then said "no."  Almost sounds like he's your Dad.  Huh.  Anyway, if it's an older dog, he doesn't need to have someone home 24/7 and the fact that you can give him a loving home would be a real blessing for this dog in his golden years.  I usually say that everyone in the home should agree on getting a dog before you get one, but in this case, I think I would have a heart-to-heart with "hubby."  His reasons for not getting the dog are bogus, so try to get to the real reason he doesn't want a dog, and maybe this time put YOUR foot down and YOU make the decision for a change!<br>  <br>  ADD:  Just read your last post - LOL - YOU GO GIRL!!!!!|`|tsnpv9whaa	I'm sorry but your husband is crazy!

However, have another conversation with your husband.  It's actually BETTER for a dog to get put straight in to your daily routine, including your normal work schedule and hours away and so on, and NOT to have someone home all day for the first week or two and then gone to work after that.  It will help to avoid separation anxiety and dogs are comforted by routine.  A sudden change from someone being home constantly to whatever is normal for your family is not a good thing- it's stressful and should be avoided.  So, have another chat with your husband- his idea is not a good one.|`|JRqzkUxUaa	Many years ago, we were in a similar situation. We decided we'd get a dog when I went from full time employment outside of the house to full time employment from home. Well, the right dog became available about 5 months before I made that transition and we took her and she was the most amazing thing that had ever come into my life.<br>  <br>  Maybe one of you could take off on a Friday and the other the following Monday so that would be 4 days off to spend with him?|`|b4yPGrBxaa	I want to tell you something, my husband has been doing this to me for 21 years.  Saying yes than saying no, not at this time or we have to wait. But oh when he wanted something he just went and got it, no waiting on his part.  And me being the dummy thought this was the way a partnership worked.  After 21 years I have finally gotten tired of being a doormat.  It actually feels pretty good.  Please don't be a doormat for that long.  I say get the dog, he will come around and if he doesn't too damn bad.  You are in this relationship 50/50 don't allow his 50% to outshine yours.|`|tao83sDxaa	mrs m, it's judy, i agree with you, maybe because i've been  waiting for a dog for a year now, because i lost gizmo to kidney disease. i wouldn't ask your hubby, i would tell him. there are so many new things that they have such as dog doors and such. go get the dog, you have so much love in you that, you need a place to put it. he needs a loving home, once he starts to connect with the dog, he'll find ways to make it work, besides making you happy. please let me know what happens? i'm waiting to get a lhasa apso right now, the owner will be bringing him in about a week.  good luck|`|W0buucLsaa	Wow. Is he your husband or your daddy? You know what I'd do if my husband said, "no, you can't do what you want?" I'd say, "Up yours." If he still even had ears left to hear with, that is. <br>  <br>  I don't tell him what to do, either. We try to convince each other that our course of action is wiser, but ultimately, we don't put holds on each other's wishes and hopes. Obviously we have to compromise on things like, "where will we be comfortable living," but for something little like a dog? No way. Not everyone is as independent and stubborn as we are, but...<br>  <br>  If you cannot also tell your husband, "No, you can't do what you want," then you really need to reevaluate what marriage means. It's not subservience.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Just let them know that something had come up and it was a family decision that its not the right time to add a dog.<br>  <br>  Im sure a small, cute dog like that has a few people on a waiting list in case the first hold fell thru.|`|Xq16SZAiaa	heres what i would do if i were you, id say bite me to your husband and get the dog...or you could just get both dogs if he could agree with that...like the dog he wants can be his dog and the dog you want can be your dog|`|O4jGlC2caa	Sad?  I'd be angry at your husband.  You don't need to be there 24/7 during the first week a dog is home.  Get a crate.  <br>  <br>  What a load of it!  I'd tell the husband to stuff it and get the dog anyway.  He has been leading you on for 3 months, and now he pulls this.  Your husband pretty much lied to you.  Maybe he's upset because you didn't pick out a manly dog or something.<br>  <br>  If you want to be the doormat your husband thinks you are, then go ahead and call the shelter up and tell them that the circumstances aren't right to have a dog in the home.  They'd rather hear someone can't take a dog rather than have someone take the dog and then return it a few days/weeks later. You're right though.  This may hurt your chances in the future.  They could view you as being wishy washy and may not be so willing to adopt a dog out to you next time.<br>  <br>  Again, I'd be chewing my husband out if he pulled that after 3 months of looking.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	The mistake you made was telling him about the dog before you brought him home.  Next time, after he says yes, don't mention it again until after you have what you want and bring it home.  Never, ever give a man a chance to change his mind.  You can always hold them to the last thing they said, even if it was a year ago.  <br>  <br>  Now for the situation at hand.  If you are not going to take the dog, you must contact the shelter immediately so they can have a chance to place it. Don't be embarrased as people change their minds all the time.  but it is not fair for them to turn someone else down while you gather your courage.<br>  <br>  You are an adult and can get it anyway, but what will be the repercussions in your house.  Will you husband hold it against the dog? or will he see it and melt.  You want the dog to be loved by both of you and not have resentment from one person.  <br>  That is why it is so important to not allow your husband to say no beforehand.  That way you are not going against his wishes.
aF0DRDwnaa	Animals reactions to talking in certain pitched voices is adorable. I always talk to animals cause of this haha. There's really adorable videos online of people saying "I love you" to their dogs and the dogs say "I love you" back so those people have real conversations with their animals =P They are so cute you should check them out if you haven't already|`|O6r6Zqsuaa	all the time, and its not useless talking to your pets, because they can understand our tone of voice to see if we are happy or sad, if we are happy then so are they. they can also learn from the tones of voice, at the moment i am teaching my male ferret to walk off his lead beside me by only using my voice in different tones.|`|G032Flc3aa	All the time about anything and everything, I thought everyone did!

UvPUopA8aa	Contact the department of Fish and Game. And ask if they can give you referrals for a local wildlife rehabbers.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	You should take them both to a wildlife rehabilitation center, since if you put them back the dog will probably just pull them out again.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	The injured kit should go to a wilflife rehabilitator.  The other kit should be put back in the nest- cover it again as best you can.  Its chances of survival will be best with its mom.  You can find a local rehabilitator on this site: <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/</a>  If there is not one listed, phone your local SPCA or humane society, they can point you in the correct direction or may take in injured wildlife themselves.

zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behavior.  Do you have play time with your cat?  Right now you have a active and energy boy, and he need to be fixed. A cat that is fixed, will have a lower temperament, and a longer life.  <br>  <br>  Cat also need play time at least for about 20 minutes, 3 times a day if you can. Once the play time is over, give him some treats, and then brush him for being a good boy.  <br>  Remember "treats" can be use as command words..  If I feed them treats in the living room, I would said living room.  If I don't want them to do something, I would move my hand slowly towards their face and nose and say no.  Go get a dog or cat training video, it is easier to watch them explain this to you.  <br>  I had a boy cat, and I have to use a under shirt when playing with him... <br>  When I take the white shirt away,  and he continue to bite my hand, I move my hands away, stay firm, and say NO firmly. My male cat since then have stop using my hand.  (he was fixed) <br>  <br>  But all together playtime is very important, even if you where to get another mate for them.  Brushing also tells them time to clam down, and enjoy as petting time. <br>  <br>  As time goes, their energy will be lesser as they get older.  I hope this help! If not let me know, I can burn you a video for free, that is from the SPCA...|`|MqYfsYd0aa	sometimes getting the cat neutered will calm the cat down.  but sometimes it always doesn't do that...<br>  <br>  definitely keep up with the punishing.  i had a cat that had the same behaviours (super hyper, attacks to the point of bruising/bleeding).  what i found worked really well, and i'm sure i'm gonna hear some tsk-tsk for this punishment, but i would put the cat in the shower.  just enough to get the cat a little wet.  what the cat would do after that, was sit somewhere and proceed to lick himself dry, and essentially calm himself down.  the cat also got to know that that type of behaviour would get him a shower, and he eventually stopped doing it as frequently as he did (every night to maybe once a month).<br>  <br>  the big thing is the age of the cat.  he is still a kitten, and is very playful.  also just give it some time, and the cat will calm down also with age...|`|XEcoJnt4aa	If you know where he might just bite you, put some tabasco sauce on that area. This might work (unless he is a Mexican cat). LOL <br>  Good luck and have a great day.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Young kittens between the ages of 3 weeks old and 8 months old will be teething off and on, and will have very strong needs to bite.  Just like baby children, kittens are born without teeth, start getting their first baby teeth at about 3-4 weeks old, then they will lose their baby teeth and have their adult teeth come in up until the age of about 8 months old.  So the trick here is not to keep them from biting; but rather, to provide them appropriate items to bite.  We use heavy-duty plastic drinking straws with our kittens, (being careful to cut off any bitten ends and discard the entire straw before it becomes dangerous, as with any toy), and train them from the start that toys and straws are purr-rectly fine to bite, but human body parts are off-limits!  If a kitten learns this from the start, there is hardly ever an inappropriate biting behavior as an adult.  Some cats start biting out of frustration after they have been declawed.  Some cats start biting out of misplaced aggression, which usually can be countered by providing the cat a feline playmate, and/or providing them more cat toys, cat furniture, and making their environment more stimulating for them.  Any time the kitten bites you make a loud “yowling” sound. If you’ve ever witnessed a cat get hurt, you will probably know what this sounds like. After you yowl, walk away and ignore the kitten. Never yell at or hit a cat. At all times, it is critical that you be thinking and acting on the firm belief that "toys and straws are for biting; human hands are for giving and receiving love.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  This is how they learn to hunt and catch prey, so that’s normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.<br>  <br>  When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that it’s a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.  <br>  <br>   Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>   Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>   Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>   In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>   Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>   If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.|`|evnj2DUpaa	DO NOT agitate him, that will give him more reason to attack you. Put him in a room alone for a while with his food, litter, and some toys. He may eventually become more civilized. NEVER be cruel to him, no matter what he does, he needs you now more than ever. I think there are courses that you can send him to so you can curb this aggressive behavior. Best of luck, and remember to be patient. These things take time.|`|o5Ez7Gyraa	my cat does this to, well did, i started carring a squirt gun and when she would attack, lol Id shot her with water, she hated it, not after like 2months she leaves me alone..she only does it cause she thinks we need to play 24/7|`|A5FMFVVaaa	u should dont ,hurst him but give him a little spank and yell NOO.my cat split open my head and my mom put his litter box food and water w\him in the basement from about9:00pm till 7:30 AM i got 12 stichs and he never attacked me again|`|2d1d5b85209c7c17b982b97dc7718229aa	As the others have said, this my be his way of playing with you.

That's what kittens do.
6C5NDSBSaa	We had the same problem with ours. There is a spray that you can spray on the things that you don't want him to chew on. It has a bitter taste to it and the second he gets a taste of that, he won't want to do it again. Its called Grannicks Bitter Apple spray. You should be able to get it at a local pet store. Also you need to get him pleeeeenty of chew toys. Keep all of the toys together and get him used to everything in that one area belonging to him and he'll stay in that area and chew on his chew toys.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|C4ixnBzSaa	Every time you catch him chewing something, take that item he's chewing and lightly hit him on the end of his nose and scold him. Don't hit him hard enough to hurt him, just let him know that you are not happy with him. You will probably have to do it a few times, but it will work with most puppies. Remember, he's just a puppy and he has to be trained.|`|BSCxz9Tuaa	Your puppy is not to old to crate train. Try putting him in there during the day with only things you allow him to chew on. It is never a good idea to give them an old shoe to chew on. They can't tell an old shoe from a new one. Only give him dog toys. You might want to buy a toy that has a hole in it  to put a treat in. (I can't think of the name of it) Your dog will work and work on it. When he is out of his crate make sure you play with him and encourage him to play with his toys. If he is laying on the floor, couch, or sitting beside you make sure you always  give him a toy or just lay it beside of him. You can also give him a puppy chewing bone. He should have lost his baby teeth by now and needs to break his new ones in. It will take him awhile not to chew on your belonging and to like his new ones. It will happen, just be patient. I hope this helps|`|gtunOva2aa	I had this problem too. The bitter apple spray i've heard works great on some, but it didn't really have much effect on our dog. My vet told me that rawhide can be dangerous to a dog, as it can cause a stomach obstruction, so we got him a nylabone, which he didn't have much interest in. In the end, we ended up having to muzzle train him.|`|yUkFvtudaa	Crate training may help.  If you can't watch him every minute, then him being in his crate will eliminate his accsess to things in the house.  Also, when he is wandering the house, have his leash on him.  When he grabs something he's not supposed to have, you can quickly correct him.  Just a firm "no" and correction on the leash.  Let him access to bones and toys, but not tons of them.  If they get a couple then it's like a treat.  Not allowing him to roam the entire house will let you see what he's getting into better too.  Keeping him the same room you are in will help until you can trust he won't get into something bad.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Exercise, Exercise, Exercise for the dog along with adequate supervision & proper dog toys.  Once a dog is tired out from exercise they will be less likely to be destructive.  Puppies begin to lose teeth at just about this age and chew on things to relieve the pain & irritation inside their mouths.  If you cannot supervise him then gate him somewhere safe or get a crate.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Please download and read this FREE booklet:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft</a>
KeevlZnTaa	A week is not enough time for untamed rats to get used to you. You have to expect this to take weeks, months or even a year to get them used to you. There is no quick fix in this situation, its all about time and patience. This is going to be a long process, if it can even be done. I wouldn't cant them out yet.<br>  <br>  The squeaking and biting is fear. Most rats will not bite, so if you have one that is resorting to biting then he is very frightened and not used to people. <br>  <br>  Start out slow. You should not even be trying to pick them up or touch them at this point. A few times each day just put your hand in their cage. Don't move it, just let them get used to its presence and smell. If they come over to smell you, I found that making a fist and letting them smell the back of the hand prevents biting through the skin. Making a fist makes the skin hard to bite into. <br>  <br>  Every time you open the cage offer a treat. You don't have to feed it to them, just put it in. Eventually they will associate your hand coming with food.<br>  <br>  If you are not causing them too much stress(be sure they are not freaking out with the contact), you could try forced bonding I recently acquired a small male who was very jumpy and hated being touched(and I have tamed rats in the past this way). He wasn't a biter so I was able to pick him up and put him in my pocket while I was watching tv. I start with a medium sized towel, b/c it is easier to keep them from coming out or coming near my hands(this also makes them feel more secure). Make sure that you do one at a time and when he/she is in the towel it is totally wrapped(not tight of course), the dark and cover will calm him/her. You are not trying to do anything but let them get used to being near you and getting used to your smell.<br>  <br>  When I trusted that the towel had made him confident enough for some contact I put him in a pocket. The pocket is on an old sweater I use for new rats. It is big with large pockets. I put the rat in the pocket. When I know that he is not going to bite I put my hand in the pocket. I don't pet him, I just put my hand in there. I do this for a few days and then start with short quick petting, nothing more than a few strokes every 10 min or so. <br>  <br>  My rat is getting used to me. I still am using the pocket, and he allows me to pet him and he grooms me after(licks). I can now pick him up out of the cage without him panicking and he get excited when he sees me enter the room.<br>  <br>  My little guy was young and not as frightened as yours, and this whole process took about two weeks(and he still has some way to go). It just takes time to tame some rats, and of course some rats never tame. I have had two rats that never liked being handled. I simple left them with a partner, they had a large cage with toys. They only allowed me to give them treats, but never let me touch them.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Some rats do not like to be picked up, but they almost never bite so there may be a medical condition, however if this is not the case here are some pretty much fool proof steps to be able to handle your rat.<br>  Pick up your rat from the side not from above it feels like a predator to them.<br>  Pick them up firmly but gently and gently stroke them with one finger from head to tail. If they squirm let them climb up and down on you.<br>  Put them back in their cage and repeat this step 2-3 times a day.<br>  After they trust you, start giving them little treats, like carrot or peas when they are with you. <br>  Continue petting them and rubbing them.<br>  Rats are extremely intelligent and quickly learn who is good and who isn't, unlike hamsters you do not need to leave your hand in the cage you can just pick them up.<br>  They might be scared at first and squeak but continue holding them, that is the only way to improve.<br>  Hopefully this helps, but remember they might have been abused at the pet store and it may take awhile<br>  Hope I helped.|`|wWE6u4peaa	i think that animals such as rats and some of the lowest creatures of the earth that truly dont deserve our attention what so ever. so um. thats what i think :P sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  id get rid of them if theyre enough of a concern that you had to ask a question about them on yahoo<br>  <br>  besides the stupid things bite you... your really gonna take crap from rats?|`|AA12107767	pick them up while they eat with the food in your other hand or stoke them while they eat if your a little scare to pick them up.|`|T1SmVFwCaa	If they are already a year old without proper human contact then its too late am afraid unless you are happy wearing gloves
KEYgd73saa	Those packets are filled with yeast.  It is possible that the yeast is dead, which would make it unable to ferment the sugar, producing CO2.  Mix it up and let it be for another day or so, and also make sure that the canister is totally sealed, or there will be insufficient pressure.  If you still don't get CO2, make a trip to the grocery store and pick up some brewer's, or better yet, baker's yeast.

You don't say what temp it is...but many dogs are perfectly fine, if not happy, to be out in slightly chilly temps.

MJbXxrjXaa	No. Convicts are extremely aggressive fish, some of the most. They will kill any other type of fish around, besides other aggressive cichlids. If you want to get different fish, take your convicts back to the petshop. But if they wont take them back, (probably not) then i guess try to let them free in a lake or sumthing. But convicts can be fun fish to keep, they basically have babies every month, if you have a pair. So its your choice, get rid of the convicts to get tropical fish, or keep them. I would try to get rid of them somehow if i were you. But dont add plecos, they will kill them! Thats waht they did to mine.|`|9kceDOTraa	The fish you have listed, Gourami should be well fine in a 180 gallon tank.  That's a six foot by two foot by two foot tank,  Gourami stay up near the top and wouldn't go near the Convicts anyways.  Angels should as well be mid to upper level fish and not dwell too far down in the tank, should your Convicts breed.  With 11 Convicts, odds are you are going to get at least 1 spawning pair.<br>  <br>  You can just as easily with a tank of that footprint keep smaller schooling fish as well.  When added in numbers, it's difficult for a Convict to target any one particular fish.  Tetra's, danio's, White Clouds could all be added in this case, in high numbers, well over 10 if needed.  You certainly have enough space for it.<br>  <br>  Bottom feeders might get a bit tricky here once your Convicts start to spawn though.  They will build a nest pit to lay eggs, which will be in the substrate, so any bottom feeders would have to be catfish that get some size and bulk to them, as well as any loaches or botia's.  Don't employ any smaller type bottom feeders.<br>  <br>  I might as well caution you something here.  Convicts spawn almost as bad as guppies.  If you do not have a solid plan to sell or rehome al the fry you are bound to end up with, it would be less then a year, with 11 Convicts, even a 180 gallon tank will ended up over populated.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I believe you can only put other types of  cichlids with them.  They will kill passive tropical fish (I used to feed mine feeder fish as a treat).<br>  <br>  You can, for some strange reason, put any type of catfish with them.  Any fish with "wiskers" or cleaner fish like pleckos.

I had that happen to me once...my Misty (the 1st one) was the love of my life and she was healthy and happy, one day she seemed lethargic then the next day she was having problems breathing so I rushed her to the vet. As I rushed her in she died in my arms. They tried to save her but they couldn't and I was totally devastated (she was only 7). They said her lungs were filled with fluid (I can't remember what its called). I don't understand how one day she can be healthy and happy and then two days later dead. I told my self that I would never have another cat again because I never want to go through losing another but you know how that goes. I have 3 now. This incident happened about 15 years ago, I had Smokey at the time also and she lived to be 18.|`|LVsE65jiaa	sounds like a strain of parvo. there's only a select few that get cats but there are more strains that get dogs. it doesn't take long for it to kill them when the symptoms start and with most of the strains there isn't much the vet can do either. very sorry for your loss. parvo is a nasty virus that happens to fast. it killed one of our dogs and $600 later there was nothing the vet could do.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Sounds like some kind of poisoning.  Could he have gotten into some chemicals, car anti-freeze, or some rat/mouse poison?<br>  <br>  I am so sorry for your loss.  I know how hard it can be the lose a pet, especially suddenly like that.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	Sounds like a urinary blockage that caused toxins into your cats body.

kWwgWSSgaa	No.<br>  <br>  In England standard practise is to give the first puppy vaccination at eight weeks old.<br>  <br>  However, some vets will give the first vaccination at seven weeks old. The reason being that the pup will have completed the course of injections and can be socialised at eleven weeks old.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	6 weeks old the first vaccinations are done..|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Yes, from a health stand point. Puppies should not be vaccinated under 8 weeks of age. It is no longer recommended protocol to vaccinate younger. Vaccinating younger suppresses immunity, interferes with natural immunity,can make a puppy more prone to get the very illness the vaccine is suppose to protect against and can cause future problems with vaccinations.<br>  <br>  <br>  All vets in the US are very well informed of the protocol and studies that have been done and are on going that are very definate on no vaccinations under 8 weeks of age. It is very unfortunate that there are still some vets that are endorsing vaccinating under age and over vaccinating.  <br>  <br>  People need to become better informed on vaccinating and become advocates for their pets not just simply doing underage and/or over vaccinating becasue it is the way that vet or breeder does it.<br>  <br>  Vaccinations should be given at 8, 12 & 16 weeks of age.  Rabies should never be given under 16 weeks and it is preferable that rabies be given at 20 weeks or older. Rabies should not be given at the same time as any other vaccinations.<br>  People should look at the vaccination protocol of all 27 vet schools, and the studies/articles by  Dr Jean Dodds, Dr Ron Schultz, Dr Bob Rogers, Cornell, Purdue, Texas A & M,  C.A.R.E.S canine vaccine advocacy, among others.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	I really don`t know what the true standard is but me, I have always`s given them at 8 weeks.<br>  now reading one of the answers here it makes me truly wonder if it can be done earlier, hmmmm.<br>  Something I need to look into I guess.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|BDRIeLqUaa	no, but it does no good before that- due to Mom's immunity- @8weeks that is gone and the pup needs the shots to build his immunity|`|C1eHfhrHaa	no- first shots at around 6 weeks, the new owners give another round at 8 or 9 weeks and the final one with the rabies at around 12 weeks.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	i'm not a vet but my puppy got her first shots when she just turned 7 weeks (she turned 7 weeks on friday got her shots on the following monday) and the vet didn't tell me it was bad or advise me to wait until the next week. However, every vet has a different opinion, so i would consult whichever vet you plan on using. If you don't plan on using a vet and are just getting the 7-in-1 shot from a feed store or wherever, then i would still consult a veterinarian.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	We start giving our pups their shots at 4 wks. You'll probably get alot of different answers but that's what we do. You want to make sure your pup receives all three of their "puppy shots."  Your pup will not be fully protected against parvo unless they get all three. Parvo is one of your biggest enemies right now because pups are extremely vulnerable to this virus. I personally keep my pups close to home until they have had all of their puppy shots. You can get your rabies shot at 3 months.<br>  <br>  Oh just so you know a "puppy shot" includes vaccines for parvo/lepto etc....<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Like I said alot of different answers. lol<br>  You should discuss this with your vet. Our vet recommends 4wks.|`|PDx6wlPQaa	Hi there, yes they do.  I took my 3, 5 week old pups to the vet today for a check up and more worming med.

(KV Vet Supply)<br>  <br>  Add:  These is NO shipping charge for meds on this site.  Also, I pay about 1/3 the cost of what my Vet charges for the same exact script. (Rimadyl, and I also order Synovi-MSM chewables)|`|Bw18seFqaa	any site worth using will cost as much as the vet.. and actually more because of the cost of shipping!<br>  <br>  You will need an Rx from your vet to get the heartworm meds anyways.. most vets will not give this, because there are too many sites selling counterfeit and expired medications.<br>  <br>  <br>  Frontline, Resolution, and Advantage are the best flea meds.. (resolution requires a rx because it also controls heartworm)  however there is a cheaper method..  instead of buying individual tubes for each pet, you can get a large tube for a dog and split it up.  (the vet may not sell it to you like that, but you can buy frontline and advantage at most chain petshops!)  <a href="http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/advantage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisaviolet.com/cathouse/advan...</a>  I have done this for mine and my parents pets.  Some products are the same thing, for cats and dogs, just sold in pre-dosed tubes...  people pay for the convienince of it being dosed out.<br>  <br>  do make sure you are using the right product tho..  for example K9 advantix is toxic to cats.  The site specifies which products to use.<br>  <br>  <br>  I prefer to get hartguard thru the vet.. I buy a 12 month pack, its often cheaper to buy the larger packs anyways, and I also get a $5 rebate check in the mail.  Also should your pet become HW infected while on the preventative, merial will pay for the HW treatment (which can cost $500-600!)...  you have to proove that your pet was being treated tho..  your vet will have records of you purchasing the medicine!|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I checked out many of those pet meds sites...and to be perfectly honest, it costs just about as much as me running down to my vet's office and refilling the supply.  So you really might to well to price compare (ask a few vets what they charge and then look at the main med sites online to compare.)<br>  <br>  As for the actual meds...I use revolution.  It covers flea, tick, heartworm, and mites.  I am in an area where this type of protection is a good idea...if I lived somewhere else, I might consider a different type of preventative.  This is something to run by your vet and get their opinion.
M3jRtq2Aaa	It is a life-long problem.  It's worse with spays done too early rather than later.<br>  <br>  If you see a dog with a "temporary" issue, it might be due to the anesthetic.  But spay incontinence is permanent.|`|3giaPYe8aa	I have never heard of this as being temporary. I have had several b*tches with spay incontinence (all Dobermans) and each one was life-long.  I would speak to your Vet about this.  Proin works very good, but if it doesn't, they will usually prescribe DES.  In both cases, there should be frequent blood testing, usually twice (at least) per year.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	Do you mean *straight* after a spay, or just short periods of incontinence in a spayed *****?<br>  <br>  I've had the latter.<br>  <br>  In one case, resolved only with medication.  In the other case, it turned out to be related to a bladder infection and the leakage stopped about 3 weeks after the infection cleared.<br>  <br>  If you mean straight after a spay.  I don't have direct experience of it, but I read a post on this site recently where someone mentioned this having happened to them.|`|L22hVXTIaa	If you're talking about incontinence right after - as in the day of and a day following the spay - then "yes."  My little Chi came home after her spay and peed once in her bed and another time on the carpet even though she wasn't squatting at the time.  I did contact the vet and he said that was fairly normal, but if it continued for more than a day or two, to bring her in.  It did resolve without intervention.|`|BWZ6pBoHaa	I suppose there could a temporary incontinence, but all dogs I know with this problem have it continually.  There is medication for it, called Proin 50, which my dog is on.
KSUPtqCaaa	It could be your dog is viewing herself as the alpha or beta female, and then viewing your daughter as the omega...<br>  <br>  You might want to look into ways of disciplining the dog that will get her into the 'omega' mindset...<br>  <br>  This would be a good one to workout with the vet...<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|VR9iC2ykaa	because you're letting the dog control you and your family. If you were the leader she would respect everything YOU own. You need to show that you are above her and that the baby is above you. You're baby needs to be the leader. So when you see the dog growl next time snap her out of it. Also try walking the dog only by your side or behind you with the baby. Maybe get a professional.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Your dog understands her boundaries where kids are concerned.  Kids make jerky movements, they have high squeaky voices & they are unpredictable; all of the things that make dogs nervous.  Be very careful about supervising the dog & child together.  A pull of the ears or tail or anything could cause your dog to bite.  Socialization is key.  Put your dog on a leash and have her sit at your side in the same room where your daughter is playing.  Give treats when she looks at your daughter & doesn't growl.  Give treats if your daughter can come over close (but not touch) and the dog doesn't growl.  <br>  <br>  It's these cases where parents hope (because they don't really know) that their dog wouldn't bite their child and the dog is under stress & bites.  It's usually the face because dogs will attack another dogs face so they will attack a child's face as well.  Plus the face is usually the thing that comes too close for comfort.  Dogs are very uncomfortable with eye contact & little children coming down to them are usually eyeing them up.|`|nFiTpDAeaa	Dogs sense fear. And when your dog snaps at your daughter she gets scared. You need your daughter to discipline your dog. Whether it be a time out or what have you. <br>  The dog needs to know that your daughter is not just another member of your pack that she is competing with, but that she is an Alpha member of the pack.<br>  <br>  Also, it may help by having your daughter feed the dog. This shows that she has control of the food- which is also an alpha quality.

If you do it yourself, all you need to spend money on is the fence itself.|`|XPcnHs7Iaa	I have the wireless version.  It cost about $500 for the base and 2 collars.

ZSXstSXBaa	i'm not sure if it's normal or not. However the same thing happened to my 1 1/2 year old american pit bull about 3 days after i got my miniature dachshund puppy. She had a 106 temp (which isn't good for a dog I think they said 101 is normal), was shaking, had a rather large lump on one of her 'breasts", and didn't want to move. We brought her to one of those 24 hour emergency vet places and they weren't much help. They wanted to charge us an outrageous amount of $ to do "tests".  So the next day we brought her to our normal vet and found out (for $75 instead of almost $1000) that from the puppy she had a "false pregnancy" and since there were no puppies the "milk" got clogged and her milk ducts got infected. They gave us some antibiotics and some medicine for the pain. I would still consult your vet b/c there could be other reasons, but that's what my babies problem was!

0m6BgESXaa	The puppy is stressed.  He's just had a major life change.  And if he's only 12 weeks old, this is his THIRD home (breeder, to your friend, to you) in 4 weeks!<br>  <br>  Clearly this dog is a BYB, because a good breeder would have taken the puppy back (or not sold the puppy to your friend in the first place).<br>  <br>  As for the housebreaking issue, at 12 weeks, he's unlikely to be fully housebroken in the first place, and in addition to that, dogs do not generalize like humans do.<br>  <br>  A 4 year old GSD that is housebroken at the place he lived for 4 years, but then moves into a new house with his family, may regress and not be housebroken at that house.  Most people are smart and take the dog to the new place as often as they can before the move is completed so the dog learns where to go potty at the new place.<br>  <br>  If the puppy is still small enough (which he should be), if he doesn't potty outside, pick him up and CARRY him to his kennel, so he doesn't have the opportunity to mess on your floor.  Give it 10-15 minutes and then trek back outside to try again.  Continue to do this until he potties.  No free roam until potty time has been completed.  This includes roaming outside.  Have him potty on a leash and praise like crazy!<br>  <br>  Get this puppy on an immediate feeding, play, and potty schedule, and you'll be able to predict within a few minutes of when he needs to go outside :-)|`|OxFsslN8aa	There are a ton of questions just like yours so perhaps you can look at some of the past posts.  <br>  <br>  One thing - a puppy that age will need to eliminate anywhere from immediately to 30 minutes after eating.  If you put him outside alone & you don't monitor his "doings" then chances are you've let him in and out too soon.  Try to monitor him - go out with him and wait so you can give him praise and a treat.|`|TfHdQHR7aa	Well, he is a puppy & you have to treat him the same way you would a baby, all puppies are like that if you cant deal with it then maybe you shouldnt have taken him.

Puppies in a new situation get confused and anxious - patience helps, as well as covering his crate at night to make it dark and "cave"like.|`|7FBAcwWVaa	I would assume it's because he misses his family. he may have the scent on the t-shirt, but he does not sense them there. Give it some time and let him know that you are his new family now. Once he gets used to the idea he will stop crying and howling. That is how my puppy was when we brought him home from a litter of 9. He mostly slept and cried, but we have 2 kids and a cat that got him right out of that habit. If it does continue, take him to a vet and have him checked out. It could be something else.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	If you are starting to get cranky, might I suggest a puppy, especially a malamute, is not the best choice for you?

O4jGlC2caa	I don't agree with it.  A pregnancy actually depletes nutrients from the mother.  That can make her less healthy.  Also, with every heat, the dog increases her chance of mammary tumors later in life, even if she does get spayed.<br>  <br>  I wonder if this person just wants a little bit of cash off the dog before he gets her spayed.

He should have her spayed before her first heat.|`|kRO55DHyaa	Your friend is an idiot if he believes that.  It will in no way make her healthier, and it will in no way "calm her down".  Preventative care (like good food, vaccines, heartworm preventative, good grooming, living indoors, and spaying make dogs healthier) and the only way to calm a dog down is with exercise, training, and time.  Puppies are just not calm, and adult dogs who are untrained and unexercised are not, either.  I have never had a spayed dog that has suffered from spaying.|`|xYyPDyrVaa	it is wrong.<br>  if you spay the dog before she goes into heat, she will be alot healthier.<br>  thats because once they get one heat, once they are spayed, they will still want to roam around, which could get them killed, put down, or get attack by a bigger and stronger dog.<br>  spaying before a heat reduces the chance of her getting cancer, tumors, and it can stop aggressivness that can/will come when she has any heats.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped!|`|Bw18seFqaa	its healthier to spay before the first heat.<br>  <br>  Each heat cycle puts her at a risk for cancers.<br>  <br>  Having a litter is not beneficial to her health in any way..  there are major risks with pregnancy and whelping.. not uncommon for dogs to DIE!<br>  <br>  It wont calm her down either..  spay and maturing will calm her down.

As long as he's only getting it to supplement the fresh foods for the weekend, I'd say it's ok, but give just a small amount at first and wait to see if it upsets his belly.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	It will not harm your guinea pig, but it does have nutritional differences and should only be used in situations like this where you use it for a short period of time. <br>  There will be no harm in using it, if they guinea doesn't like it (which they probably won't) give them fresh veggies and fruits.<br>  Hope I helped.|`|LmFGYK7laa	if the blend has nuts then NOOO because guinea's can choke ... and im not sure about the pellets ... but you should give him plenty of hay and veggies =)|`|YAPEpa5baa	Most definitely not a good idea.  Guinea pigs need more vitamins in their diet, and stabilized Vitamin C.  In the few days of feeding him hamster food you could kill him - and for several reasons - the lack of Vitamin C, not enough nutrients, seeds and nuts that are not healthy for him, and could cause him to choke or cut up his insides.  How long does it take to make a stop at the store for some food for the guinea pig?  With just vegetable and hay, you might end up coming home with a guinea pig who has diarrhea.|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	I woundn't. The nutrients aren't the same and it could harm your guinea pig.|`|nPdKJyK4aa	NOO! Please dont feed your piggy guinea pig hampster food! The seeds could get caught and he could choke. The pellets are made out of the wrong things and could really upset their sensitive stomaches. Your piggy will be ok with plenty of hay and some fresh veggies.

373f96d5a517b165dd1bfe69f2a1be91aa	I suggest crate training your dog.  Make it so it's just big enough for her to turn around so she can't go in one spot then go lay in another.  Leave her in there when you are not at home and when you are home keep a very close eye on her cause when she has to go she will probably start sniffing or going in circles and try getting her out before she goes.  Another thing you could do is leave  her on a leash while you are inside so you can always have and eye on her and she will learn that once she stops going inside she can be free in the house.|`|AA11706151	Use a crate for housebreaking, the same way you'd use a playpen for a baby.  Not to punish the dog for being bad, but to keep her out of trouble when you can't ACTIVELY supervise her.  That prevents her from learning bad habits like chewing your stuff and going to the bathroom all over your place.  She will need plenty of time and attention out of the crate when you have time to watch her.<br>  <br>  These are the books that I recommend to my students;  you can get them on Amazon.com<br>  What All Good Dogs Should Know – Volhard  <a href="http://www.volhard.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.volhard.com/</a><br>  Good Owners, Great Dogs - Brian Kilcommins<br>  Dog Tricks : Eighty-Eight Challenging Activities for Your Dog from World-Class Trainers by Haggerty and Benjamin<br>  Don't Shoot the Dog - Pryor<br>  Training Your Dog: The Step by Step Method - Volhard<br>  Dog Problems - Benjamin<br>  Cesar's Way - Cesar Millan<br>  Also, watch the Dog Whisperer on the National Geographic Channel.

AA11554026	He may not be in pain, the most common reasons for whimpering is pain or protest. When you are eating and your dog has to beg, it will normally whimper as if saying "that's not fair, i don't wan pedigree, i want hamburgers!" or "Please please please gimme some!" <br>  <br>  Here's some things your dog might be meaning when he whimpers after a walk:<br>  <br>  "So.....Tired......Need.....Water"<br>  "I want to go again!" <br>  "I'm so tired......Why did you take me on that walk"<br>  "Did the walk have to be that longgggggg?" <br>  <br>  if he is too tired you can start taking him on a shorter walk.

Unless in recent years they been banned.  But We have had alteast owned 5 of them in the past  and bought them from breeders.|`|4b96522cdada9bee2a93669cc4023651aa	Well considering that my grandfather had them for nearly 50 years and he died nearly 25 year ago and that the cuties are still all over the US, the US is a perfectly good source. Where lil_e_4ev... gets this "until recently they have ben banned" is completely mystifying....guess my aunt who continued my grandfather's lines doesn't know that her dogs are or  were 'banned'.<br>  <br>  There are two types:<br>  <br>  Pembroke - short tail   <a href="http://www.pembrokecorgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pembrokecorgi.org/</a><br>  Cardigan - long tail.    <a href="http://www.cardigancorgis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardigancorgis.com/</a><br>  <br>  Those links take you to  the National Club Breed Club for each breed which is the only club about the breed that is recognized and accredited by the AKC and it  sets the standards for the breed . The Clubs' websites will give you an ENORMOUS amount of information about the breed - the good, the bad, and the why or why not to get that breed. The clubs websites also have:<br>  <br>  (1) a breeders list - all of whom have agreed to abide by the breeders code of ethics (which you can read)(<br>  <br>  2) a link to the breed rescue for their breed<br>  <br>  Do give serious thought to adopting from an adult from a breed rescue. The clubs' breed rescues go to a great deal of trouble to determine the dog's temperrment, personality, likes and dislikes (particularly kids and cats and other dogs in the household), health, and level of training. They make a huge effort to match the right dog to the right home - and if they don't have one they think will be suitable for your home, they won't place it. Great way to avoid the puppy training, newspapers, chewing.......They have dogs that are purebred and part-bred (1/2 or so of their breed.) Dogs that come through rescue are so thrilled to have a forever loving home having once been abandoned to a shelter or rescue that they are typically extra devoted and loving. Dogs lose their homes for reason that are not their fault: death, divorce, a move and they couldn’t keep them, financial problems….<br>  <br>  If you decide to get a puppy, please use one of the breeders who are members of the breed club. A well-bred pet puppy may not be a candidate for the show ring (that nose being 1/8th of an inch to long or something else very picky) but they will be very healthy, the parents carefully screened for hereditary health problems, and from a breeder who has devoted a great deal of time to understanding the breed and bloodlines. A responsible breeder will have a written contract with a health guarantee for hereditary problems; require that if for any reason you ever have to give up the dog that it comes back to them; and always be available for help, assistance and advice about your dog. Such a breeder will tell you if they don't think their breed is right for you based upon your needs. They want a perfect forever home for the puppies - not the money. (In 43 years in the dog show world, I have never known a breeder of that caliber who has made a profit on their dogs - it is labor of love.)<br>  <br>  A puppy from such a breeder costs no more - and often less as poorly bred dogs tend to have very high vet bills over the years - than from a backyard breeder who doesn't do the health checks, knows nothing about the breed or bloodlines, doesn't give a guarantee, never wants to hear about the puppy again and has breed from mediocre or poor quality dogs.<br>  <br>  You may find the breeder who has the type of dog you want but no litter on the ground at the moment. Most good breeders have waiting lists -get on it. You may find the breeder and puppy you want but at a distance. Among the really responsible breeders(members of the club) shipping a puppy is quite normal -they want the best possible home for the dog and the written contract is very extensive. <br>  <br>  Do ask the breeders on the club list if they have any dogs they bred that they need to rehome - good breeders all require if the owner can't keep one, it comes back to them. It may be a dog they placed and it came back because the owner didn't have time, didn't realize how big it would get, got divorced.... It may be a dog who was a show prospect but as they grew didn't meet their early promise. It may be an AKC Champion they decided not to use in their breeding program because while it did get the Championship, they don't need more bloodstock or find a tiny conformation flaw they don't want to reproduce.<br>  <br>  NEVER EVER buy from a pet shop. Those puppies came from puppy mills where the parents are locked in cages, bred until they literally die from it, never vaccinated, never wormed, fed just enough so they don't quite die of starvation, live in filth, never bathed or groomed or cared for, are typically of very poor genetic stock both physically and often mentally. The puppies are shoved off to pet stores with no vaccinations, no worming, no socialization or handling... You are buying nothing but heartbreak at a price higher than what a responsible breeder charged for a pet puppy.<br>  <br>  IF A SERIOUS BREEDER OR RESCUE TELLS YOU THAT THE BREED IS NOT SUITED FOR YOUR SITUATION - BELIEVE THEM - NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THE WAY THE DOG LOOKS|`|8f6d7df4f9a9d1837489325dea55817caa	There are many reputable Corgi breeders in the US<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pembrokecorgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pembrokecorgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  Cardigan Welsh Corgi<br>  <br>  Parent Club: Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America, Inc.<br>  Breeder Referral: Lynn Stoltzmann, (763) 536-7710<br>  Regional Clubs: website<br>  <br>  Pembroke Welsh Corgi <br>  <br>  Parent Club: Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America, Inc. <br>  Breeder Referral: Anne Bowes; EST (781) 934-0110<br>  Breeder Directory: website<br>  Regional Clubs: website|`|df8ee8dc87864925de2028d98d5d45dfaa	The USA.|`|4da2b1cb5cbccaaf5d3035066a11d410aa	There are breeders in the USA.

Inclusionon such a list does not mean you should not a questions of your own about the background and health of the parents and puppies or intent of the breeder. Preferably you should visit the breeder before the puppies are born (because who can resist a puppy, even in a bad kennel?). If puppies are not currently available, ask to be put on a waiting list.

03062ca6b6e52f37026a11b4b15302deaa	I have always been told by my vet to not let her have any food, only water. Also, they suggested pepto bismal (sounds weird I know)- I tried to give it to my dog once and she licked it a little and shook her head at me. Apparently my hubby and I aren't the only ones in the family that can't stomach pepto! Best of luck to you and your pup!|`|4939f4f2847bfe7093b3c4dbd2c90d41aa	try to keep her away from the deer.....too much could really make her sick if not a little....GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!|`|d275ad119fbd8faa9de7686ea905c1aeaa	Rice.  Just plain white rice is excellent for upset tummy.  The rice absorbs any toxins the dog might have and neutralizes at the same time.  It also helps to regulate his digestive system.  Plain white rice cooked in water.|`|AA10378559	Watch her, see if she vomits again, what color is it? If it's mucosy yellow, it's probably just something she ate. Dogs will eat just about anything they find. But if it is white and very fluid, then it could be more serious, such as an infection. Then try to get her to a veterinarian as soon as you can.  See if she is at all active, will eat anything, etc. is anyway her usual self. Sick dogs can be hard to spot since they can't tell us in so many words. We have to learn what to look for, and for this I'd recommend getting one of the available books on dog care that has a section on illnesses, etc. Hope she gets better soon.
65689a36110aa4028e5564d771af8d2faa	Hi! Get lots of toys and just in case some no chew spray. I have had 3 labs and all of them chew and dig. But they are the sweetest ever. Rawhides and tennis balls, frisbees, and sqeauky toys tend to be big hits with labs. Also lots of runs or walks. He is still a pup and ofcourse he will bond with you! He will love you the same as he would if you knew him since he was born. Be kind to him and always show your respect and love and there is no doubt that yal will have a great relationship! As for beds a nice large bed with the sheep skin like top works well with labs. They love to cuddle into things and he will surely love that unless you want him with you in your bed ofcourse. Best of luck with your new buddy!|`|2b19a1b9e374123863b114554eb4db24aa	six months is still so young, i wouldnt worry about him bonding with you, i'm sure he will. labs are known to be very high strung, so i would be prepared to take him on a few walks a day especially if you dont have a fenced yard. I would also get some chew toys, if he doesn't chew thats great but i would prepare yourself with lots and lots of chew toys for when he gets bored. I  would also buy a crate for him, puppies can cause a lot of damage if left alone in a house plus its good for them to have a place of their own where they feel safe. I would also find out what kind of food he is on and keep him on it at least for now, if you switch right away he may get an upset stomach. He will need a checkup with your vet and i would also get him an appointment for a bath with your local groomer. Labs may have short hair but they shed like crazy  and its good to get them used to grooming early so that the pup doesn't mind having his nails clipped which most of them dont like. Labs are loyal dogs and love to have fun. Good luck with your new pup!!!!|`|dfbfdcf9b2aafeca1078702e876fd283aa	Remember he is still a puppy but a "starting to be strong" puppy so dont let him get away with things like jumping up on you-they play a little rough at times. They are good dogs though. Take your time with him, spend every spare moment you have working with him on a daily basis and you will be fine.|`|689e41fbd57f9111a88071538f82eedaaa	just put away stuff you don't want him to get into like cleaners and stuff like that. i have a black lab and he is so sweet. he is the best dog i have ever had. make sure you have some chew toys and bones. things like that. get pet bed and the bowls. i bet he will be very cute!! have fun!!!

If by job you mean real job, then you could just do odd jobs around town for people, mow lawns, shovel snow, pick things up clean house, etc.<br>  Do all these things and your money will get there soon. Don't rely on just one too much, cause you never know if it will last.  You want to get there as soon as possible anyways.|`|91946fa35890cc33ca122e01530bd0b5aa	I agree with Chloe.  Also, hamsters get sick too.  You would need money to take it to a vet.<br>  <br>  That being said, it will be summer soon and people will be having yard sales and someone might be looking to get rid of a pet they decided was too much work.  Look on Craig's list and in the local papers for a pet that noone wants and will let you have for a fourth of the store price.|`|2ce98a42c494b283fd26474e79dbc805aa	Have a yard sale.|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	A hamster's life span is around 2-3 years, so you will need about $300+ for food, medicine, bedding, etc for that whole time. Try putting a wanted ad in the newspaper, or go to a local pet store and ask about helping around to fill up your fund. I wouldn't try Petsmart, because that is corporate, try a personally owned business.<br>  <br>   If that doesn't work, I think the best thing to do is make flyers and put them in mail boxes, or on doors around where you live. On the flyer will offer your services like carwashes, yard cleanup, painting, house cleaning, dog walking/pet sitting, etc. Hopefully you get some calls from elderly people who love talk and give ya good tips. You should be able to make that money in no time, plus you can meet lots of interesting people. And also tell them that you are doing this because you want to buy a hamster, maybe someone will help you out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Rl4GIsYQaa	you could send in a video clip to america's funniest home videos. if they pick one of your's you get $100 plus a tee shirt. i bet you could send in a winning clip. i've already sent in 2 winning clips.|`|XzT7jDrbaa	I am posting a link to a site which has information that might be helpful to you, especially if you are in need of some extra cash to help out every month.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://putterpods.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://putterpods.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  :>)|`|lK0Vrn4Vaa	STAND ON A STREET CORNER WITH A HOMELESS SIGN THAT READS NEED FOOD FOR MY HAMSTER....PLEASE HELP|`|oxttzGrTaa	if you don't have a job, how will you pay for bedding, food and all the other necessary supplies. you'll need money on an ongoing basis, not just for the initial purchase of the animal. hamsters live for years... it's a long term commitment.<br>  <br>  you should have a steady source of income before investing in any type of pet, even a hamster.
3f92b9a6ee574d2ec6bb1ce33fdeb14faa	ask friends if they want him. Try either pet smart or pet co who sell animals, they have adoption days, they might take him. put up a few flyers around town.

Check with your Vet NOW to get him neutered. Also, ask the Vet if she has any sources to adopt out the cat.|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	Am I to understand your going away for a month?  Why not ask a trusted friend or family member to take him in while your gone.  Assure them you'll buy all the food and litter he'll need while your gone and leave permission with the vet for them to treat him if necessary.  Be sure and call to see how things are going with him weekly.   I gave my vet money towards medical care if needed when I was on vacation and since things went fine I had a credit with my vet for future visits.<br>  <br>  If this won't work for you, notify your vet of him needing a home, put up a flyer there and at food stores, any place that has a notice board.  Place an ad in the paper if you have enough time.  If your sons are in school have them tell all their friends he needs a home and for the friends to ask their parents to help.  Whatever you do don't put him down.  Ask you vet about any rescues that might be able to help.  Some shelter put down animals turned over right away if they have no room.  The ones they find get to live for up to a week only.  No kill shelters are hard to get your cat into, but call them too.|`|9swAqdrDaa	give him to a friend. grandparent, old bf, new bf, anyone you know that could take him in. maybe even someone in school (if your in school) goodluck|`|Z1E1d3oqaa	There are many wonderful animal shelters out there.  I volunteer at a no-kill shelter and no animal is put down.  Some animals stay a long time at the shelter.  However, being a young cat, he probably won't be too long in the shelter before being adopted.<br>  <br>  The first suggestion I have would be to put up fliers at work, school, in your neighborhood and also petfinder.com; there is a link for posting adoptable pets:  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/post/classifiedhop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/post/classified...</a> with a picture of him and some info about him.  Like a "Free to Good Home....."  If you get no response before time is up, use petfinder to locate shelters in your area and start calling around to find a no-kill shelter.  <br>  <br>  Please, please, please, do not just release him outside to find his way, he has a much better chance of finding a good home through a no-kill shelter as most shelters check on prospective adopters before releasing an animal to them.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you all,<br>  Karenpa
0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...hematuria (blood in urine) is indicative of a lower urinary tract disorder/infection which requires urgent medical attention.  A cat can suffer from a urethral obstruction which is a life-threatening as cats can die within 24-48 hours if left untreated.  <br>  <br>  Feline lower urinary tract disorder: <a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_feline_lower_urinary_tract_dis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_fel...</a><br>  URETHRAL OBSTRUCTION: <a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/urinary_blockage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/urinary_...</a>|`|3078cd70f433dfb3bb90750ecbb76adbaa	Absolutely.  Take both of them to the vet.<br>  <br>  Chances are it's just a urinary tract infection.  But blood in the urine could be a sign of something much more serious.|`|3a3d08e727ccd6550d0796d218d6d8f8aa	absolutly cause the one cat may be able to give it to the other|`|AA12334614	“Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease” or FLUTD is the term describing the following group of clinical signs:<br>  <br>  bloody urine <br>  straining to urinate (can easily be mistaken for straining to defecate) <br>  urinating in unusual places <br>  urinary blockage (almost exclusively a male cat problem) <br>  licking the urinary opening (usually due to pain) <br>  Some veterinarians may still be using the older term “Feline Urologic Syndrome,” “FUS,” or simply “cystitis” (meaning literally “inflamed bladder”).  Because the syndrome can have many possible causes, it was renamed to discourage the perception that the clinical signs seen represent one disease with one cause. It was becoming too simple for medical professionals to diagnose “FUS,” prescribe a treatment, and look no further for a diagnosis, writing off recurrence to the classical course of the syndrome. Even less accurately, this condition is frequently referred to as a “bladder infection,” which it usually is not, in an attempt to simplify its description.  <br>  <br>  In fact, the key to treatment is the determination of a cause if this is possible (and it frequently is not).  This web site attempts to answer the questions that cat owners have about this syndrome, its possible causes, and rational treatment plans to alleviate it.<br>  <br>  WHAT CAUSES FLUTD?<br>  <br>  Central to treating a cat with FLUTD is determining which of many possible causes is present. It turns out that different diseases are common in different age groups of cats with this syndrome.<br>  <br>  The average age of a cat with FLUTD is 4 years. Of all cats with FLUTD:<br>  <br>  50% will not have a cause which can be determined despite extensive testing <br>  20% will have bladder stones <br>  20% will have a urethral blockage <br>  1-5% will have a true infection <br>  1-5% will have a urinary tract cancer <br>  1-5% will have had trauma to the urinary tract (i.e. have been hit by a car etc.) <br>  1-5% will have a combination of a bladder stone and an infection <br>  If one looks only at cats over age 10 years of age, the likely possibilities are completely different. In this older group:<br>  <br>  50% will have true urinary tract infections <br>  10% will have bladder stones <br>  17% will have a combination of infection and bladder stone <br>  7% will have urethtral blockage <br>  3% will have urinary tract cancer <br>  5% will not have a cause tht can be determined despite extensive testing. <br>  Further:<br>  <br>  66% will be in some stage of kidney failue <br>  5% will have urinary incontinence <br>  HOW CAN THESE POSSIBLE CAUSES BE SORTED OUT?<br>  <br>  In younger cats, there is a 50% chance that testing will be fruitless. Given this, testing beyond an examination and urinalysis may not be performed unless the syndrome is recurrent. <br>  <br>  In older cats, it is more important to look for a diagnosis. A blood panel, urinalysis and urine culture will detect the 50% of cats who have urinary tract infections and the 66% that are in kidney failure.  Radiographs will pick up any bladder stones.|`|c3096dc35696b370648a0861328656dbaa	One has a urinary infection which causes cats to pee outside their box, and evidenced by blood in the urine.  Many male cats are suseptible to UTIs.<br>  <br>  Take both to the vet.  The vet will be able to FEEL the one's bladder and give the poor guy meds.<br>  <br>  DO NOT WAIT.  UTI can cause urine retention and an inability to "go."  It can rupture the bladder and cause death.  In the meantime, kitty will be in more and more pain -- possibly to the point of running screeching through the house but you won't be able to catch him.  Pain and illness can make cats avoid the very hands that are trying to help them.<br>  <br>  See a vet---TODAY.<br>  <br>  Lifes<br>  <br>  <br>  PS One cat CANNOT give a UTI  to the other cat.|`|d20b4d332b6bf30b2bef085efd42f522aa	this is serious, blood in the urine is a very good sign of infection, the peeing every where is because they can't control it as it hurts so much to pee. please take both cats to the vet.|`|dd577e488beeb708718b7488118cbea1aa	Absolutely...go to the vet ASAP! Your cats have either kidney infection, urinary tract infection,  excess protein in their system, or numerous other problems. Older cats have these symptoms, and they need medical treatment. The blood in the urine means trouble. They are not urinating everywhere because they are misbehaving. They are having big trouble and need your help. Please...take them immediately! And there is a good chance you and your cats can get this problem taken care of and live happily together for many more years. Good luck! And thanks for asking your question on here. Most people would just punish their animals for being bad.
ed4c6d0f7fa2625eb30d37fff8224a64aa	?Si se están comiendo el alimento para peces? Yo sólo una vez tuve renacuajos pero sí logré que se volvieran ranitas ^_^ minúsculas las ranitas por cierto, medían como medio centímetro las ranitas adultas, la cosa más genial que he podido criar hasta el momento ^_^ <br>  <br>  Volviendo al tema, a los renacuajitos esos más bien les gustaba comer pulga, no tanto el alimento para peces, a lo mejor no están suficientemente nutridos y por eso no comienza la metamorfosis y por eso también la pérdida de color.. Difiero completamente de que les guste el agua sucia, yo los tenía en mi pecera y esa pecera tiene filtros potentes, créeme que el agua no estaba sucia (no se las cambiaba diario por los filtros, pero repito, no estaba sucia). También puedes intentar ponerles unas plantitas de acuario naturales, muchas veces esas plantitas vienen llenas de animalitos (que cuando las mete uno a un acuario, es un problema con los peces porque contaminan su agua y pueden enfermarlos) pero yo creo que los renacuajitos pueden alimentarse de esos animalitos y si no tienes peces no hay problema.<br>  <br>  Otra cosa es que dependiendo de la especie, el tiempo para la metamorfosis varía, habría que documentarse más al respecto. <br>  <br>  Suerte con tus renacuajos, espero que logres mantenerlos hasta que sean adultos.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	kisa esta muy klorada el agua................|`|78029f1c2b82abd5ba86c9026d0c6ce9aa	sera que siendo renacuajos les guste el agua muy limpia?? yo los que he visto han estado en agua sucia|`|LgLTSWi5aa	ESTAS SEGURA QUE SON RENACUAJOS Y NO PECES????<br>  MUCHA SUERTE!!!|`|Ttmw1cbfaa	no creo que tienen que tener una agua parecida a las que viven no, bueno y hay vos como los tenes? no se depende muchas cosas la verdad no lo se|`|c03e4c1efbd4ea5c227d59a076cbddc2aa	Les cantas?

392ad70e66a7046bc1bbbd3ad3bfdb86aa	Your kitten will grow out of the agressive state, the water bottle and no do help speed it along. Around 8 to 10 months your cat will be around full grown.|`|AA10980351	He will grow out of most of it, but try not to over-react when he bites or scratches, it will re-inforce his aggressiveness.  When he gets too aggressive, pick him up and put him away from you, and then ignore him for a while. When he is calm gently stroke him, but do not rough house.  Try playing with a cat toy instead of your hands.  Cats tend to like chasing things like foam rubber balls too.  He needs to exercise.  Cats are mature by about 10 months, and can breed then too.  Have him neutered at about 8 months, before then will tend to affect his growth, after then is more difficult for him, and he may have already started to spray (mark his territory) a habit that can remain after neutering. Good luck!

AA10863983	Well, just like humans, sometimes they are just not cut out to be mothers.  This is the hard truth of nature.  Yes, many, many animals in the wild have been known to abandon their babies.  And I suggest that you should probably seperate these babies from the mother because if she is ignoring them and continues to ignore them, she might eat them.  Mother hamsters have also been known to do that.  You should probably also take the mother and babies to the nearest small animal vet and talk to them about how to care for the babies if the mother will not.|`|386048dcc515e3a0968394e7a9430dfaaa	Not all Gods Creatures are perfect & smart! sometimes it takes a litter or 2 for them to figure it out!

Take it to the vet for a checkup and ask the vet about the eye.

Either one, it's not normal for pups to have a growth, vein or scratch on its eye.  We suggest you take the dog to your vet and get it checked out as soon as possible.  <br>  <br>  We're also concerned that you bought a 6-week-old pup.  In most states it's illegal for breeders to sell dogs before they're 8 weeks old.  A 6 week old puppy should still be with it's mother during part of the day.  (If the pup was born on 10-16-06, it's now 6 weeks old... and it needs a DHLPP vaccination.)<br>  <br>  After you take the pup to your vet, turn the bill over to the person who sold you the puppy and get your money back.

Thats one thing that makes mixes different from purebreds, purebreds have a defined appearance and size within a breed standard.  Mixes may have a wide range of looks and sizes, or may look like neither parent, it may be bigger or smaller than the parent dogs, and if there are other breeds in either parent's background, it may end up looking like a different breed altogether.  I've seen GSD-pit mixes that looked like labrador retrievers more than either parent.  The prettiest GSD-pit mixes I ever saw looked like  German Shepherd dogs, except they were brindle with white on the chest, they were smaller and stockier with less angulation than the German Shepherd parent, but except for color and size, they looked like GSDs.  So you may look at many pictures and not see anything that would truly represent your own dog's characteristics because with a mixed breed, there's no way to know what genetics will come through in the progeny.  Pups in a mixed breed litter may not even look like each other.  In the litter the brindle and white GSD looking dogs came out of, there was also a solid light cream puppy that looked more like a golden lab pup in color, and it didn't look like either parent in its structure, it looked more like a beagle type of dog in structure than anything.<br>  <br>  I did a search and didn't come up with any obvious link, but there were some links to animal rescue organizations with pitbull-GSD mixes up for adoption, and that may be the best way to search for photos, by looking in the shelter ads.|`|cd89dca6966a8e66b1f48ed803b361d2aa	i saw your dog very cute

Personally I want to see who is purchasing one of my pets, their interaction with the animal and if they seem to understand the ongoing committment.  Unfortunately, too many animals are mismatched and go to unsuitable homes ending up in a shelter.  This would be avoided if more thought was given to the buyers lifestyle and personality.  <br>  <br>  Unless you are buying from a known breeder, I wouldn't buy online either, we aren't talking about a piece of clothing.  You are counting on someone else to pick out a suitable temperament and character, not everyone can train a dominant dog, for instance.  I'm sure there are a lot of local breeders for whatever type of pet you have in mind, if not, find a breeder in "Dogs Canada", they also list cat breeders.  Just from your subject title, I don't think you are a serious buyer or seller and would hope you wait until you are older or do some research.

Have the ears cleaned and keep them cleaned (after baths, swimming and maintain them!).  See the vet for antibiotics for the infection.  Switch the dogs food to a high quality food that contains no meat by-products, no beef, no corn, no soy, dairy products, chicken, wheat or even chicken eggs. No BHT or BHA preservatives. You need to find a protein source like venison, rabbit, fish, duck or even ostrich. Some foods to try : Flint River Ranch, Natural Balance, Canidae, Timberwolf, James Wellbeloved, Wellness Fish and Potato, Wysong's...just to name a few. One of the other problems could be that this isn't a food allergy, but an environmental allergy (dust, mold, pollen, etc.). Sometimes adding the Omega 3 oils helps with the skin, along with diphenhydramine (benedryl).

You don;t need to engage your dog in a discussion as to why you are leaving and when you will be home... this just makes him think you leaving is a big deal... and when you do get home... or return to him don't get him all excited... a little pat on the head and a few minutes of quiet time before you sit and pet him like mad will help him not seem so anxious.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	Put him in a crate where he can see you and start going out of the room for short periods at a time.He will soon learn that you will be back.When you have to leave the puppy for long periods do not say anything to the puppy just leave and do not say anything to the puppy when you return.He will soon learn that you leaving and returning is just a normal part of the day.|`|f765d105a7c848c459875aaa14dc9b9aaa	Its tough, but you just have to let him whine.

AA10746470	Dogs will eat just about anything, including their own feces or that of other animals. As disgusting as this sounds, it's common enough to get a fancy medical name: coprophagy, from the Greek kopros (dung) and phagos (one who eats).<br>  <br>  Yes, it's an unpleasant topic. But you have to realize sometimes coprophagy is a natural and normal act. Newborn puppies haven't yet learned to eliminate on their own, so the mother dog licks them to stimulate urination and defecation, and then licks them again to clean them up. In other circumstances, nature will prevent all that waste from...well, going to waste. For instance, cats need a higher percentage of fat in their diets than dogs, which means a higher level of waste fat in their stool. Anyone who has dogs and cats knows the pooch will have his nose in the litter box, searching out the leftover nutrient in "kitty chocolates."<br>  <br>  When adult dogs eat their own stool, though, it's a different story. Usually, it's a sign of loneliness or boredom, although on occasion, miscues in housebreaking will result in the dog eating stool because he's learned the presence of stool sometimes gets him punished. Actually, coprophagy doesn't present any problem for dogs, with the possible exception of eating stool containing parasite eggs. It is a major aesthetic problem for the owner, however, who must witness it and whose face the dog then tries to lick. You can try to break the habit by relieving the dog's boredom or loneliness: Give him more attention and exercise, rotate his toys so he doesn't have to play with the same old thing all the time, and feed him more than once a day so he has something to look forward to.<br>  <br>  Prevention is the only sure cure. Pick up after your dog right away, or muzzle a coprophagic dog when walking in public areas. Set up cat litter boxes where Rex can't get his nose into them -- or simply keep them clean of stool by scooping several times a day, especially before and after feline mealtimes.<br>  <br>  As soon as you notice this behavior, make a trip to the vet -- there may be a physical cause for a dog's coprophagy. A belly full of worms or other parasites could rob Rex's body of vital nutrients, and he might be eating whatever he can find to try and make up for it. There might also be a nutritional deficiency in his diet. Adding brewer's yeast to his food will boost his intake of B-vitamins. Pumpkin or raw carrot will add fiber to his diet and help him feel full. In some cases, solving the problem is as simple as switching Rex over to a food with more fat, fiber, or protein. Your vet can recommend a brand better suited to Rex's dietary needs.|`|b3a9cb04f7081dd4a39e0319c3aa3acfaa	The behavior is called "corophagia".  Mother dogs clean up after their puppies by eating their feces and licking up their urine in order to hide the puppies' scent from predators and to keep their living space clean.  But this is not a behavior that should be tollerated in other dogs.  Dogs who eat other animal's feces may ingest diseases or parasites from the stools.<br>  <br>  Some dogs may eat feces if their diet is lacking in some trace elements that the dogs think they can get from the stools.  A change in diet can correct this.<br>  <br>  Some dogs eat feces because they like the taste. To stop the behavior you can use pills or powder added to the dog's food that makes their stolls unpalatable.  You can also train your dog not to eat stools by correcting the behavior every time you see it.  A firm, calm consistent "no dirt!" command right when the dog is going after the feces is usually enough to break a dog of this habit.<br>  <br>  Making sure you clean up after your dogs yourself is the best defense, of course.|`|3385075d3d16e1677bd1325a91868d9caa	Dog eating feces or coprophagia is a vices developed in an untrained adult dog. Feces eating are a natural behavior of the dog. This habit is more common in puppies than the adults.<br>  <br>  The dogs that come from dog shops and rescue kennels are most likely to have this habit. The dog can also pick this habit from poorly cleaned pet houses. The feces that remain in the kennel, if not cleared immediately, may tempt the dog by its smell, there by resulting in dog eating their own feces.<br>  <br>  In some animals boredom may be a cause for coprophagia. When the dogs are kept alone in the dog house for longer time, they may try to consume feces as they have nothing else to do.<br>  <br>  The dogs have 3000 taste buds as against 10000 taste buds of human being. The dogs have two hundred million cells in the nose as against five million cells in case oh human beings. Hence for dogs smell is more important than the taste of the food.<br>  <br>  In order to stop dog-eating feces, we need to clean the feces as soon as possible. We can also add pepper in the feces, the taste of which the dogs will never like. We should feed the animal at proper time. The dog should never be allowed to be hungry. The hunger may prompt the dog to eat the feces.<br>  <br>  It is better to feed the dog 3 to 4 times a day, in small quantities instead of feeding heavy food for 2 times. This will reduce the output of the dog. Some dogs may have excessive hunger which is due to insufficiency of exocrine pancreas. Those dogs will eat anything and everything including its own feces.<br>  <br>  Some people, if they see their dog eating feces, they will rub the nose of the dog in its excreta. This is a bad practice. The dog may get used to the smell and can continue to do the same thing [feces eating].<br>  <br>  Some owners have the habit of shouting at the animal, if they happen to see their dog eating their own feces. This also needs to be avoided as this can make the dog to eat the feces hurriedly.<br>  <br>  The sight of dog eating the feces will be certainly disgusting to human being, but the smell and consistency of the feces is attractive to the dogs. Last but not least, putting muzzle to the mouth of dogs may stop the dog eating faces behavior at some extent.|`|AA11987492	It is called Coprophagia. It is NOT normal, however fairly common.

AA11566068	I have a pug and they are pre-disposed genetically to collapsed tracheas, so I've looked at alot of collars and leads.<br>  <br>  There is a company here called Black Dog Wear <a href="http://www.blackdog.net.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.blackdog.net.au</a><br>  <br>  They make exceptionally good: <br>  <br>  - nylon martingale TRAINING collars for training (less harsh than a choke/check chain) at the dog club or when I'm walking and want to get in some Heeling training;<br>  <br>  - and I use their CAR HARNESS (small size) for general walking.  This harness (designed also to attach to seat belt of car) is exceptionally easy to take on and remove, and has all benefits of Lupi harness (ie. no pressure on trachea/neck . . . all pressure distributed on chest) but fits comfortably on dog and doesn't come off like a Lupi.  I use this when they are in the car (it is designed and comes with special attachment that easily attach to car seatbelt) and general walking.  But you cannot use it for off lead walking.<br>  <br>  - I also have a general nylon collar with their ID on it when they are at home or for general walking also.  But because aforementioned trachea worries, I prefer the Car Harness . . . and the harness is as eay to put on as an ordinary quick clip collar (the only harness I know that is!)<br>  <br>  What is really good about this company is that their collars AND LEADS are all length adjustable (yes . . . you can adjust the length of the lead also!) . . . and they even make specialised leads and collars for Flyball and Agility (the only company I know that does).  Seriously, I cannot recommend them more highly, all vets and my training club here in Australia stock their products.<br>  <br>  The detail they use in design is amazing . . . they have 2 seperate lD-loops metal loops, one for attaching ID and the other to attach the lead so that they don't 'catch' one another, quick-release but strong clips (especially important to quickly and easily get a collar onto an exuberant and bouncing excited dog about to go on a walk).  You can even 'adjust' the pressure of their nylon martingale style training collars, which means they don't ever choke the dog!<br>  <br>  I've also used leather leads (and expensive ones made by Burberry Pets (not the lousy designer Burberry, but the proper Burberry Pet range now discontinued and Coach) but the collars and leads by Black Dog Wear are  more comfortable (for me and dog), easy to use, and practical for my dog (I leave a normal collar on him during the day and he doesn't try and scratch it unlike every other leather collar).  The price is also fabulous (and I've used the same leads and collars for 5 years . . . washing every couple of weeks).|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You want something that's not going to break hair.

Besides the fines and court costs (which are extremely hefty) the other problem you are going to find is a Vet. Because we are not allowed these animals most vets don't know how to care for them properly. The other problem is finding the supplies you will need to care for them. It can be rather difficult to find all you will need to make it happy and healthy. There are tons of other possible animals that make wonderful pets, such as Rats. Because they are allowed here (Cali.) you will have endless vets and supplies. --Good Luck

This means, they like doing things like pulling your hair, biting you, bouncing off walls, opening every and any drawer, throwing feces, breaking things.  Not only are they aggravating, the larger ones like capuchins can be very dangerous.

6bd524b158cd908d4fd528f37faf335faa	Birds do not generally like being touched in places other than the neck and head by strangers, and right now, you are as close to a stranger as they've ever met.<br>  <br>  The fact that your keet is allowing you to touch her (him/her -- you can sex your bird by looking at the color of the nares) is promising. Focus on playing with your birds. Transport them to fun places, like the shower (they'll need a dry place to perch, where maybe they can come into the water if they feel like it); take them to the desk you do your homework at, or take out their cage to your TV-viewing area, so that they can hang out with you.<br>  <br>  Another great way to make yourself part of the flock is to offer them whatever you're eating (you'll need to check out a list of foods toxic to birds -- some poisonous foods will surprise you). Flocks eat together. They know that instinctively, and they'll remember your courtesy in the future.<br>  <br>  Once they're used to playing with you and spending time with you, they'll warm up a little more to a wider variety of touch. It's going to take you a while to get used to bird ettiquette. They're not like any other pet you've had.|`|136d7c8abeea66d9a71fda2a93229a6caa	OK first of all you have to work with them slowly, it might let you pet it but it's gonna take time for your bird to let you hold it. And you might try giving them millet spray/seed. And if you want to get it to where the bird will let you hold it try putting some bird seed in the palm of your hand and letting it eat out of your hand and it will slowly or eventually end up sitting on your hand. But you have to give it time and be willing to work with the bird. I hope it all works out for you and your birds, This is what I did with my bird and everything worked out well. Good Luck!!!|`|AA10433249	You need to not be in a rush to touch them, if they were parent raised Keets they are not used to being touched, many Keet do not like to be petted.

I'm assuming you're talking about boarding your cat, right? I'd call the place you're going to board them and ask them, then call a vet and ask how much they'd charge to do the vaccinations.

At the minimum you will want to use a single three-way vaccination (and booster 3-4 weeks later if the cat hasn't been vaccinated in the last three years) against Rhino/ Panleuk/Calici. Many vets use 4-way vaccines that also include Chlamydia (an upper-respiratory infection). Bordatella may be recommended.

As for just a dog with no papers you can show in open classes with the UKC.  But if your dog isnt registered you will have to find some type of Pit Bull club or Organization in your local area that may do it.|`|8258df383388e301d876365e52f67999aa	ADBA was at one time a registry for only Pit bulls, I believe now they have started accepting other breeds though.  But really any UKC dog show you attend there is guaranteed to be APBT's.  If you just want to look at the dogs, check out some weight pull competitions as well.  Pit Bulls are notorious for being fantastic at that and are always competing.  Good luck and hope I was helpful.|`|mQBBKqstaa	is it an A.P.B.T.(Amirecan Pit Bull Terrier  or a Staffordshire terrier pit bull is a generic term for any dog that looks like one of these|`|53cc6a401c0e12428280a5e36332b2f1aa	Check out www.PitbullForum.com and talk to other owners and find out any upcoming events around your area. There is a forum just for pitbull events. Hopefully this link works:<br>  <br>  www.pitbullforum.com|`|mFDpcJtpaa	I've heard of an American Pitbull Club which has shows.  Not sure what type of pitbull you have but do a search online and that should help you  :)
dohkOpTAaa	I have a siberian husky and a golden retriever and they are both great dogs, but i like the husky better.<br>   <br>  They are both very hyper dogs that require lots of energy.|`|00d62b88c8aa82117ad039d66e73fd7aaa	I have a wonderful 11 year old Border Collie, he is extremely loyal and intelligent.  The Border Collie is not a breed for everyone as they need a job to do and will become extremely destructive with out one.|`|cKzaMGXJaa	Well I have 4 dogs 2 greyhounds an eskie and a chinese crested<br>  American eskimo, a hardy dog, very little health problems energetic, bositerous, can be yappy, alert, easily distracted not always a good choice for novice dog owners as they can be a handful, heavy shedding  twice a year<br>  <br>  Chinese crested  high maintenance, requires alot in grooming especially the hairless needs frequently baths and having skin moistured, affectionate, playful, gentle natured, sturdier than they appear<br>  <br>  Greyhound  very hard to obtain as puppies thankgoodness as they are little whirls winds, and terrors  as youngsters but as adults  especially the retired racer very laid back,  quiet, non demanding, low exercise needs , gentle and sensitve and low maintenance, they do not have a skin that produces oils so not not get a doggy smell even when wet,  they tend to be an easy breed even for most first time dog owners, requiring little in the way of training, most know how to walk nicely on leash due to track training but they need a bit of adaptation  when they first become pets as most everything is new to them such as shiny floor, seeing a tv go on for the first time,  having a car drive past them, so at first things may scare them till they realize  the new sights or sound are not a threat to them,  because they  love to chase they should be kept on leash unless in a fully fence enclosure|`|e41a4d80df8e5a9e6f0d182f3531b31caa	*French Bulldogs- they just fit so well into my lifestyle, perfect temperaments<br>  *Bernese Mountain Dog- good dog but lots of grooming<br>  *Belgian Malinois- not for the inexperienced dog owner|`|0ErIk9Vaaa	I have a yellow lab/ hound mix.  He is very intelligent and loyal.  I have had many dogs and my mutts have been the best as an overall dog (few health problems and great companionship).  I am able to spend a lot of time outside with my dog, so a high energy dog (like labs) are not a problem for me.  If you are not home much, I would suggest a more laid back breed.  Go to <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com</a><br>  and look at all the info there.  Good luck.|`|89o9m1dpaa	A lab.  She is a wonderful dog and generally they are a great breed.  Fantastic with children.  Loves to exercise.  She loves to be a part of the family.|`|GYmgfZj9aa	I have A golden Retriever he is fun and sweet and luvs to cuddle|`|ThoFAWR7aa	Keeshond! We have a 7 year old and no breed has a lovelier personality. They love kids, and people. They are easy to train, because they just want to make you happy. They are big but like being indoors as well as go for a walk, and are so companionable. Smart and funny too. They are barkers and have a shrill annoying bark but only when a stranger is at the door. If someone is let into the house they just want attention and petting. This makes them good watchdogs but not good attack dogs.<br>  <br>  Their coat needs a little upkeep but not as much as you'd think. The breed hasn't been ruined yet by unscrupulous breeders but always use care.|`|b51fe95de4a0cc25bb38d05157bb3571aa	Mandi is right! What kind of dog you get is highly dependant on your lifestyle and personality.I have a shitzu,and a lab. My lab is soooo sweet.He is gentle and obedient.I personally like those traits in people and animals.What types of people do you click with? If you like strong or assertive types you might like bullmastiffs or terriers. If you like energetic fun types then maybe a poodle or sheltie. Anyway,you get the idea.This is a unique but effective way of deciding on a dog breed.|`|b790df260f1f2189ad1bcca19d51bd3baa	Get a boxer! They are so misunderstood but are the best dogs ever. They are absolutely wonderful with children and are tremendously intelligent.|`|f444d2c7f763663ec3abd14d6eed9f38aa	I have a pug. She is he cutest thing. She behaves perfectly. And when I say bedtime she sleeps. When she has to go ouside she lets me know. She even lets me paint her nails. She loves to play and is very loving.|`|fX4YXzZnaa	We have a German Shepherd pup and she's lovely but I'm worried about all the hair shedding in the future. It depends on you of course. A clever one?|`|o0sH4kipaa	Yorkshrie terrie I have 15 of them I have to take them out. they our a good kind of breed. You can breed them but watch where your walking they are small. They need toys to play with and attion too.|`|ucYGulD2aa	Make sure YOU know what you want first. If your at work constantly don't get a dog that has a lot of energy, but if you have time to spend get a dog that will enjoy playing. I have two labs, they are amazing, and perfect for my needs in a dog.|`|wIs9PJeoaa	Dachshund- I love their energy and heart!|`|LPEO6AsCaa	I have always had Golden Retrievers-  I love their look their loyalty and their friendly kind manner.<br>  <br>  These are the very dogs for me but may not be for you.  You should pick the kind of dog you want not what we have.|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	We have Doberman Pinschers.  Very loyal breed. Very easily trained. They are not a dog for everyone, but if you have to time and love to put into one, you'll wonder why you didn't get one sooner.
E1XEQyxLaa	Call animal control or a humane society and ask them what you should do or who to call.|`|TkqY6dZ6aa	If they are wild birds like Mallard there isnt really anyting that can be done. If they are domestic ducks try emailing the Duck Rescue Network for help placing them in a new home. <br>  <br>  www.duckrescue.org|`|GBwBwH5iaa	keep them they make great petz just show them to the vet|`|f2UG5r1laa	I would call the ASPCA and ask them what to do|`|p5MSjtzDaa	You can call your non-emergency number to your local police department to get the number to wildlife removal or Duck removal, non-profit agencies.  I know here in Broward County,Fl we have several numbers to these sorts of agencies.  Hopefully, thru your police dept,sheriff's office ? you can find people that voluntarily do these sorts of things...God bless'em & you too
