AA11408911	Hey MacSas,<br>  <br>  A handful of users have commented that their Yahoo! 360 images are failing to show as avatars in Yahoo! Answers and these have been filed as bug reports in the suggestion forum. Staff members are aware of these issues and should be working on a fix.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try uploading the image once more, ensuring the image size and format are correct. If you have uploaded multiple images, try deleting an old image from one of of the four available spaces to try and free up some room. These may help to resolve the issue.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|AA11528760	It's Yahoo's problem. Sometimes the "Yahoo360" link turns up on the "My Profile" page & at times it's absent. They haven't fixed this problem yet. <br>  So, the next time you want to edit your profile, just make sure that the link to Yahoo360 is present on "My Profile" Page, so that your profile picture remains unaffected.|`|sqgjcotoaa	maybe you are not looking at it right. but if you relax and be cAREFUL YUO KNOW KNOW YOU FIND IT
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Your Avatar.<br>  <br>  Your avatar can be a cartoon figure or a photo. The cartoon figure is also used in Yahoo Messenger and appears on some customized Yahoo pages. The photo only appears in Yahoo 360 and Yahoo Answers. If you do not have an avatar then a shadow of a male figure appears. It can't be changed to female.<br>  <br>  № 1. If you want a cartoon figure then go to <a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> and create or modify one and then go to № 3. If you create one of the wrong sex then it can be changed in "preferences".<br>  <br>  № 2. If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to upload up to four photos there from your computer. Mark the one you want to use as your avatar as primary.<br>  <br>  № 3. Now for either a cartoon or a photo save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or photo to use.  BE SURE TO PREVIEW AND SAVE (OK) THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit">http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: Many people are having problems with the Yahoo 360 avatar showing up.

GpbYrDU6aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Here are some ways you can earn points:<br>  <br>  If someone gives you a thumbs up - 1 point<br>  If you get a Best Answer - 10 points<br>  Answering a question - 2 points<br>  <br>  <br>  For every point you get it brings you closer to your next level, check your profile and it will say:<br>  <br>   "Points earned today"<br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  "Points until next level."<br>  <br>  <br>  If you get to around level 5 or above, you're doing pretty good and can be a "Top Contributor", which means you're basically top at answering questions for a certain topic/subject.<br>  <br>  <br>  You haven't said where you read it, was it on Yahoo! answers? I think the reader is un able to fully solve this unless they see what the question was, if it was something like, "How many points to Level 4?" then the explanation would be all about levels etc., but if it was, "How do I earn points?" the explanation answer would be about how you earn them.|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	I didn't know they had a bit of use for them.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.<br>  <br>  For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.<br>  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.<br>  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts".<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not post a picture and ask if the person is pretty or to rate them. That is considered chatting and is a violation of the guidelines.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

AA11408911	Well the answer this question is not completely straight forward. Essentially, users should understand that there is no specified number of violation notices to merit the automatic suspension of a user's Yahoo! Answers profile, so don't get to worried about a non existent ten strikes and out.<br>  <br>  it is believed account suspensions coordinated by the Yahoo! Answers customer care team and can be enforced for numerous reasons. As a rule of thumb, the more serious the offence, the quicker a user's Yahoo! Answers account could be suspended. For example, chatting, one of the most common violation on Yahoo! Answers will often only merit a point deduction, whereas posting adult content would be far more likely to result in the instant suspension of a user's profile. <br>  <br>  Very serious offensives, typically those that violate not only the community guidelines yet the Yahoo! terms of service as well could merit the termination of your whole Yahoo! ID including your mail account, however by and large, only a user's Yahoo! Answers account shall be suspended, thus allowing users to continue to access other Yahoo! services.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is no stated amount.

It indicates what you think of an answer not necessarily the best. The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.<br>  <br>  The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button. You must vote before the vote closes after 2 more days.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|tdQTZPI7aa	You cannot rate them just pick the best answer|`|YLVKEsUBaa	Click the button

F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points.  Level 7 starts at 25,000.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Levels 5, 6 nad 7 have unlimited questions and answers each day.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|6qsTmMQaaa	There are seven levels.|`|V44ARW4maa	7 levels and you can't do much more at that level than you can at level one, with a few exceptions.

There's seven levels. Like the seven deadly sins.... Just kidding! I don't even know why I said that....  The best way to get to a higher level is to answer more than you ask.  When you do answer, pick the ones you can be as sincere as possible, that way you've got a chance to get a Best Answer. Which is 10 points.  I haven't been on Yahoo as much as I used to, but I can't begin to explain how good it feels to get a Best Answer. Not for the points,(there nice too),  but for the fact that my answer helped someone in such a way they felt mine was best. It's 'great' to try and help people you've never even met........on that note, "We're kind of all family here".   Good luck : )|`|mAV5MJQnaa	There are 7 levels, it depends on how much you accumulate the points until it reaches to the next level. I know it starts from level 1.

But there are several reasons questions are deleted  not all are violations:  ? No answer in 4 days  ? Answered, voters choose "No Best Answer"  ?  Best Answer reported for violation  ?  Reported as violation    Appeal violations/suspensions using link in email, or this form:  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|V44ARW4maa	follow the appeal link found in your violation notice, but don't hold your breath waiting for an answer or don't expect a successful appeal. Yahoo isn't all that great about appeals, though i have had a few reversed, but it took weeks to hear about it.|`|AA10421992	At the bottom of the violation notice you'll see "customer care" in blue letters click on there.|`|sMTVcfiVaa	They send you an email telling you that your question was removed. Follow the link in the email and explain why you think it should not be removed. They respond to your email relatively quickly, but I doubt they'll ever reverse them. Make extra sure you're complying with the rules and regulations. They tend to remove things that might be considered chatting.

You might have to get the code from your server to do that.   You might also try going into control panel and then clicking on folders to bring up a menu of your folders:    The best way to stop that happening is anytime you are not using your computer is unplug it and unplug the phone line if you have dial up. If you have high speed broadband also unplug the modem.    An easy way to do that is to buy a power strip with a switch built in it.  Then just turn the switch off when you are not using your computer. That is basically the same as unplugging it because the switch turns the power off to the plugs on the strip.
tqAEoOAdaa	Delayed messages. The problem is due to the large files that are being download, if you have dial-up and your computer is not one of the latest system, you will be encountering problem of delayed messages.    Are you using window blinds or alien guise or some other window enhancement program? e.g. programs that add extra buttons like transparency and keep always on top or change the look of the windows in anyway (not including standard XP themes)  if so disable it and yahoo should work.  Go here instead of trying to get it from the Yahoo messenger site >> http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.h...    I do recommend you get the 8.1.0.421 version as it is the most stable a bug free version of Messenger!!    When you download it just save it to your desktop and then run the installer from there.    If you have XP just double click on it to start the install.    If you are on Vista you will need to Right click on it then click "Run as Administrator" to get it to install correctly.  If this also does not solved your problem then you can download old version from  http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=...  Heres some help from the Messenger Pages  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/messeng...  http://www.wackyb.co.nz/Yahoo!_Messenger...    This is sometimes a Flash issue, make sure you have download and installed flash from Internet explorer (not any other browser)  http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/    To delete address bar history as it also helps, follow this path.

And this girl who I blocked went into another account and continued insulting me.  I reported her to yahoo and nothing happened.

KGKEOse5aa	How i usually solve these is by letting on integer be x and the other y, where Y>X. so then you just read and fill in numbers... "three times the lesser (X in this case)" so that's 3x, "exceeds twice the greater (y)," 2y, "by 45" now this part may be confusing. It is saying that 3x is 45 more than 3x, so to make them equal, 45 must be added to 2y like so... <br>  2y + 45 = 3x. Now you know they are consecutive integers, so x + 1 = y. Now you can substitute (x + 1) in for y in the first equation. You should get 2(x+1) + 45 = 3x. then distribute and get 2x + 2 + 45 = 3x. Now add 2 and 45, subtract 2x from both sides, and you should get x = 47. You know y is x + 1, so y = 48. <br>  <br>  Final answer: x= 47 y= 48 (I checked this and i'm pretty sure it's right, greatly sorry if i'm wrong)<br>  <br>  <br>  Sure hope this helps.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	47, 48|`|9eMYzY0Paa	I HATE MATH!!!!!!!!!

The official explanation is that it is fluid, and they give a vague explanation of the criteria, but there is no actual explanation as to how you get it, and how you lose it, in numbers.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Top contributor is someone who is knowledgeable in up to three categories. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular category and is said to be reviewed weekly. the top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time.

syT3XUAraa	I've studied dream interpretation, so I'll give it a shot: You need to focus less on things that seem important at the time, and more on what is more important to you. Like her. When I first read your question, for some reason Cinderella's lost slipper came to mind. When she lost her shoe, if she had stuck around, the spell would've worn off in front of the prince. Do like she did. Pay attention to what's more important, and less focus on the little things in life to get the things you want the most. Hope this didn't sound too lame, and hope it helps. : )|`|NHkeejRKaa	keep track of your ****** shoes and you will get to hang out with chicks.|`|dOelpoecaa	who knows but ill take 2 points =)|`|iZf62jacaa	she was probly thinking you were not paying attention to her.<br>  <br>  cuz you were messing with you shoes (trying to find shoe).<br>  <br>  try next time u see her pay full on attention to her.<br>  <br>  so she knows she is getting the attention she needs:)<br>  or she  just needed to go home maybe it was getting late.<br>  <br>  good luck:D|`|WItdtl0Vaa	It means that you really like her because your subconcious is thinking about her while you sleep.

Sometimes I believe our subconscious thoughts can play out in our dreams.  I don't know how your shoe messed up the dream, but maybe you lose something alot and that is why it showed up in your dream.|`|FszxeECvaa	Nothing really. Your mind just tries to entertain you while your are sleeping. Usually your dreams are mostly about what your were are thinking about before you fall asleep.

Its because you have been thinking about this girl a lot, imagining her all the time and she is in your unconscious mind. A dream is just a reflection of our unconscious mind.|`|xVBk8C7aaa	shes gonna give u the booot!|`|9oYdGmmiaa	maybe that this girl you like is right infront of you, and if you keep consintrating on little things in your life, she will leave because your not paying attention to her<br>  <br>  ?-just a guess. im no dream annalysist. or anything.|`|XbbEI7d1aa	I don't think it means anything, but maybe she wanted you to pay more attention to her, and less to your shoe.

As far as the scroll bar moving by itself, you might be touching the wheel on the mouse and don't realize it.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	The scrollbar?  In your browser?   The "sidebar" is something different, but I'm guessing that you meant the scrollbar.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about a browser, it's impossible to know for sure with the very little information you provided, then that is because the page you are viewing is still loading.|`|TyJuZnZhaa	Perhaps you have a BHO?

It is very high quality and one of the biggest Chatting Places in the world, and as you can have about 1000 contacts per account, it provides a lot of space for your emails. MSN Plus! allows you to make your names and personal messages in a range of colours, backgrounds, and effects such as italics, bold, underline, and strikethrough. Webcam features provide no set-ups, you just need it turned on, not set it up.<br>  <br>  Now I'm not saying Yahoo! is bad, but it is kind of a copy-cat version of WLM, because it has basically the same features, but very similar. <br>  <br>  Go for WLM, it's much better :)|`|C9AbiTDdaa	yahoo msg

These are just a collection of all the pages you may have visited on the internet, which slow down your pc, but are safe to delete. To do this, go to Tools once you've opened your internet browser. Then, click on Internet Options and in the Temporary Internet Files box click on Delete Files. DO NOT DELETE COOKIES, you need these. After it's completed, your pc should be running faster.    Another problem can be that you either need to perform a disk cleanup or disk defragmentation, which also allow your pc to run faster. To simply do these, go to Start and then All Programs. In the Accessories list, go to System Tools and click on either Disk Cleanup or Disk Defragmentation (or both, not at the same time, though). Windows will prompt you from there.     The last problem could be that you might need to run a Virus Scan. If you don't have a program/software installed to do this, there are many security software sites that can perform a free one time virus computer scan.Its mostly the Viruses which make the Internet Slow.    On top of your Internet page click Help.There click Trouble shooting which will tell you some of the tips to speed up your Browser!

If you want a cartoon figure then go to http://avatars.yahoo.com and create or modify one and then go to part 3.  2? If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.  3? Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers. Click on your old avatar in Yahoo Answers which brings you to your profile. Now go to "Edit My Info". You can pick the cartoon or picture there to use.  BE SURE TO SAVE THE PAGE AT THE BOTTOM. Shortcut: http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit    ? ??l???q ?|`|6qsTmMQaaa	You have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!
