20080929181513AAP8oS8	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How to hook up a 4-way switch?	I have a room that has 3 switches in it for the same light fixture.  I did some research and learned that there was such a thing as a 4-way switch (only knew of 3-way).  I am remodeling the home and putting in all new switches.  I went and bought the 2 three way switches and the 1 four way switch.  Pulled the old ones out and replaced them with the new ones (same exact connections).  Light does not work correctly.  One switch turns it on and the other will work only if you turn the original back off.  You get the point.  Since the first failure I've changed the wiring enough that I don't remember the original set up.  Anyone know how to test the incoming power and how to use a 4-way switch.  There is a red wire in the boxes.   Thank you

20090109061421AAv8d1D	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Installing a Junction box with no studs around?	Hi,      I recently bought a loft condo in chicago. I've been installing new lights and making a lot of upgrades but I have one area which requires a junction box, but there isn't a place to mount it.      I'm installing a wall sconce in a walk in closet. I wired pre-wired flexible conduit to a junction box near another light, and fish taped it over to where I needed to put the box. When I cut the wall, there was nothing near the location to attach the the box too. Since its a loft, the walls are basically hollow boxes of dry wall put up. Its hard to explain but there isn't anywhere with in 4 to 5 feet to mount the junction box. For now, the fixture is just screwed into the dry wall, but is there some kind of box that can be mounted in this instance, without a stud? Something that just screws into the dry wall?      I'm sure I can rig one of those ceiling junction boxes that just brace in between studs, but I don't want to do that.

I have a 14 year old brother who is home-schooled and spends the whole day doing some homework and playing video games.   Both of my parents work around 8-5 and seem to have a warped sense of how much housework I should be doing daily.   I generally should vacuum the whole house 3 times a week, do the entire kitchen daily, clean our guest bathroom daily, keep up the laundry with towels, dust the house daily, sweep our floors daily, keep up my room and make sure to make my mom and dads bed every day and make dinner mostly every night.   My brother has to take out the trash and keep up his room.   Now I don't mind having to make dinner or vacuuming but compared to my brother just taking out the trash I think the system is a little messed up.   I think it should be split more evenly and fairly.   What would you suggest be the fair amount of chores for each of us, or is it fair already and I'm just whining around?      Also, do any other kids make their parents beds or do any parents make their children make their beds?   Also what is your opinion on dads making their oldest child do his and her brothers laundry?      Thank you :]

If I need to replace the thermal fuse, how do I get at it? The online diagram indicates it's accessed from the back, but there is no back panel to remove like there is in the diagram. Do I need to remove the front panel and reach all the way to the back? Or is the fuse somewhere else?      Thanks

I live in Brooklyn, NY in a multiple dwelling unit and overlook the courtyard.

20090203065320AAhfLoE	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Why is my new hob so hard to clean?	I have got a new ceramic/halogen hob on the basis that it would be much easier to clean. However, after just a couple of uses I have noticed that the stains are almost impossible to get off. I was told by the fitters just to use soapy water when it is completely cold, but I have also tried using flash power spray and a warm hob, to no effect.   I have a professional cleaner in daily but even she cannot get the stains (basic water marks/spillage from standard cooking). Anyone have similar experience or tricks of the trade to get this thing clean or should I get the suppliers to replace it?
20090203065324AAxnVwR	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to remove white stains from laquered wood?	I have a bedside table made of wood,  it has a matte finish with lacquer. One night i brought a thermal bag with the intention of use it in a sour muscle and let it settle a bit on the table. When I realized the table was marked where the bag was, leaving several white spots. I read somewhere that using toothpaste and scrubbing i would be able to remove the stain, after a long scrubbing session the stain didn′t disappeared, the worst thing is that the abrasive action of the paste closed the pores on the wood and gave me a satin finish on the affected area and the stain remains.  Any one?
