20090219172839AALopWu	News & Events;Current Events	In your opinion, was the NY Post's cartoon racist?	A lot of people are up in arms about the New York Post's cartoon comparing Barack Obama to the chimp that was shot by police for attacking a woman in Stamford, Connecticut. Some say it's racist because of the fact it's comparing the president to an ape, and it implies that he will be assassinated. Some say it's not racist because it's just criticism of the stimulus package and that it's like an ape wrote it.       I want to hear your opinion. Racist or no?    http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/18...

20090203111516AASCcHy	News & Events;Current Events	How is wasteful spending of our taxpayer bailout money going to be accounted for?	If a business needs a huge bailout and is hosting expensive parties at resorts, and giving big bonuses to the top brass, should they have to be accountable to the taxpayers.      Shouldn't wasteful spending of the bailout funds be criminally prosecuted?      How can a company layoff employees and host a party that costs more than the combined salaries of laid off employees?      Shouldn't companies only get the bailout if the share holders do not just pocket the cash by taking dividends, and they guarantee repaying the taxpayer?      Any thoughts to help avoid the greed and excess from continuing?       I say hold the companies responsible... no more luxury boxes, or company private jets, or limos to transport exec's, or company dinners costing $500.       How about a $50.00 max per person for meals on company expenses- $200 max per night accommodations- no more vehicle allowances-       GIVE YOUR EMPLOYEES RAISES- DON'T LAYOFF WHEN SPENDING MILLIONS/BILLIONS IN CORPORATE WASTE! SEND THEM TO THE BIG HOUSE IF THEY ARE STEALING FROM AMERICA!

Now my question is, if you don't have HD, why show these HD quality photo's?   You cant see any difference because you don't have HD.      If you can see the difference, then you already have HD and wouldn't be interested in the advert to start with.

All these doctors, lawyers and social workers that have been ripping off their host governments, the citizens of those countries and not giving a damn about you whether you are in Jaffna, Wanni, Colombo or any other place on the island. They want to scream about genocide when it is the money they have bilked, the media they have bought and their refusal to this day to ask Pabraharakan to let the civilians leave conflict that has created this situation. They expect you to die so that they have something to talk about and make money off.    http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db90...    "To ensure the total safety of the civilians, the government has approached influential sections of the Tamil diaspora and other prominent parties to exert pressure on the LTTE to release civilians but so far, response has been negative, Minister revealed"   Tell  Dr. T. Varatharajan and his staff that you are not staying back to be used as human shields, line up at the beach and be ready to be evacuated. Look at these doctors-they are not asking for you to be released, they only want to make sure that you continue to stay where you are further exposed to LTTE atrocities. These people live abroad, collect money for Pabraharakan and his terrorist associates, make profit on it (for they are part of who funds and control the LTTE) while you are left to be shot at, killed, held hostage, kidnapped. There has been so much food and medicine sent for your benefit but you do not see it. The money that was sent to help you after the tsunami was stolen and used to but submarines, attack crafts and build mansions for the LTTE. These Tamils abroad doctors, lawyers, social workers not only steal from you at home but do the same when you move to another country. Respond to the Armed Forces. They are there to help you. These others, we should give them another name for they are already Americans,Canadians, Europeans or Australians. You are Sri Lankan citizens your country cares about you and will help you.

Do you agree with this?       Or do you indeed think that the new President Obama can withdraw the troops by 2012, avoid any terrorism casualities and fix the economy at the same time?       I think Iraq is the new Israel. 50 more years of conflict, here we come.

Please read the questions and the concluding sentence before answering these questions. Thank you.      We don't have surplus money to draw from, these government projects are being done from borrowed or printed money.      How long will this continue in your opinion?      1. What happens when they stop funding the US?   2. What happens when we have to pay them back?   3. What happens when we have to raise interest rates on the Treasury Bonds to satisfy their worries about us paying them back in full value?

Jade is NOTHING and will always be NOTHING.  Get over her and move on i say.
