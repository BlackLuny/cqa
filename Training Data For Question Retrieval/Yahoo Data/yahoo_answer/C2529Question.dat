20070429153129AAZXKjG	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Replacing heater hose for 97 Honda Civic?	Hello,         I have a 1997 Civic EX with almost 213k on it.  I have been having cooling problems with it recently.  I had the radiator replaced last year after it burst and spewed coolant everywhere.  Since then, I've had the upper and lower hoses replaced.  I replaced the thermostat myself and after that watched as (what I have identified as) the hose that runs from the engine to the heater valve was spewing coolant on the engine and doing it FAST.  I know it's probably an easy fix but just wondering if (being attached to the engine and all) there's anything special that I need to consider.        I'm new to this so bare with me.        Thanks in advance.

20070526223105AAvxgAi	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my 2000 Civic A/C intermittently not turning on?	About three weeks ago, I started my 2000 Civic and though the A/C switch was on, it wasn't blowing any air.  But about 10 seconds later it started blowing air on its own.  Then tonight we started the car, and again the A/C didn't come on.  We turned it off and back on, tried a few diff settings, but nothing...not even the usual clicking noise that the A/C makes when it turns on.  We even tried turning the car off and back on, but the A/C just wouldn't start.  We would hold our hands up to the vents but absolutely nothing was coming through.  As we started driving down the road, after about 2 minutes it suddenly it just started blowing air again.  When it does come on, the air is just as cold as ever.  Any guesses what the problem is?  And if you do know, just how much is this repair going to cost me?  Thanks!

20061218051152AAxteTo	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Escort N reg, central locking doesnt work?	My central locking has gone crazy.  I try to open the doors the drivers side with key and c/l keeps whirring but wont open the doors at all.  Had to climb in the boot, could then manage to open the passenger door, but not the drivers door, and still the c/l keeps whirring.   The door handles keep going backwards and forwards all apart from the drivers door.  Very scary being locked in a door and you cant get out.  Please help?  Thanks
