Thankfully nobody was there to see this (i am very SHY), but it was in BROAD DAYLIGHT and there was a road right behind me that nobody ever used.

Vi prego datemi tutte le indicazioni che potete per aiutarmi a rinfoltire e arricciare il riccio anche se penso che ci sia ben poco da fare per la piega. sto usando prodotti biopoint, bioscalin, cose che prima d'ora non mi son mai neppure sognata di usare.

(nope, not even in L.A.) who has even heard of it, let alone does it. This makes me think it didn't work as advertised. I tried to find out from the company what is different about this perm that it can create curls on big rollers when it's never worked in the past, but they were evasive. Before I give up on it completely, I'd like to hear from anyone who's had it done, or knows someone who has, and what the results were.

Check it out:       http://farm1.static.flickr.com/86/254122...       It's from the lead singer of Incubus.  The tattoo is a Buddhist mantra written in Tibetan.  I'm not that big of a fan of Incubus but something about that tattoo is appealing.  It has it's known meaning but the meaning to me is different and unique.       My biggest concern is that I don't want to steal someone else's idea but at the same time having this written phrase inked in is fairly popular in different parts of the world.  Also, I'm looking to get the same concept (coloring, dimensions) but on my left forearm.      What do you think?

20090205152426AAmyR2m	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	TANNING!!! please help!?	Ok, so I go tanning in tanning salons. I noticed that I slightly burned around the core of my body (stomach, hips, butt, etc...) and my arms, face, and legs are only getting slightly darker each time I tan in a bed.       I know it's because your stomach is in the center of the bed, so it gets the most light. Next time I go tanning (tomorrow), I think I'm going to apply some sunscreen to where I got burned so the burn heals and doesn't get worse. However, I  NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL TAN MY FACE, ARMS, AND LEGS!       Is there anything (like oil?) that I could apply to my face, arms, and legs tomorrow when I go tanning so they will get tan quicker? Preferably something that I could find at my home and not have to buy.       thanks! =)
20090205115904AAGI1T9	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How can I make my sunburn fade into a tan quicker?	Ok, so yesterday at around 3, I went to the tanning salon and tanned in a bed for 8 minutes. My face, upper chest, arms, back, and legs all got a shade or 2 darker, but my lower chest, stomach, hips, and the verrrry top part of my thighs got sunburned.      For the pain, I take a couple advil and it helps a lot. I put lotion on it in the morning and night so it doesn't peel or dry out. When my skin burns, it always turns into a tan after wards, unless it's a MAJOR burn, but luckily this isn't that bad of a burn. How can I make the burn turn into a tan quicker (preferably in a day)???         thanks so much! =)

20090205152458AAzfdG1	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should this hair color correction be done for free?	I went into a Regis salon for the first time today for a weave and a trim.  My hair is mostly gray, so the stylist did blond highlights with darker lowlights to the top and framing my face.  Totally happy with the color and cut, EXCEPT for one spot, over my left ear.        When I left the salon, my hair was styled in such a way that I didn't notice any problems.  But after I got to the car I lifted up my growing-out bangs to see what it would look like with my bangs clipped back, the way I often wear it.  And there above my ear is this HUGE chunk of really blond highlight with a horrible-looking diagonal stripe of the darker color cutting across it.  It looks awful and it's totally visible with my bangs clipped back!      Is this something I should be able to get corrected free of charge?  I'd like to go back in tomorrow and politely insist that it be fixed, but I don't know what the norm is.       This salon and stylist are new for me, and I paid $145 for the color and cut.  I don't want to seem like a b***h, but on the other hand this looks pretty bad!  I liked the job except for this section; on the other hand there's no way she wouldn't have noticed this, and she didn't point it out and offer to correct it, even though she didn't have any clients waiting.      What do you think?

20090205123435AAkfOZz	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Finally my skin is clear fro acne scars.?	Ok for over a year, i had acne scars.   They were red marks left from ance, and they were horrible and hard to cover with make-up, i mainly got them on my checks.   Id come on yahoo and ask will my acne scars ever go, i explained they were red marks left from acne, most people said, they will fade it time but will never go, well im hear to prove theres hoope for acne scars to go in time, and dont listen to the people, who tell you they will never go..      For the past 3 months, iv not used any products on my face, apart from mostrizer. I washed my face twice a day, started drinking water and eating fruit. Day by day my skin was clearing itself up, and now im acne free.   I just want to say, these products from shops, are rubbish and will probarly make your skin worse, it didf for me anyway.      Try being on a healthy diet, it reallly works. Its takes ages but its work.

20090205121456AAFw31x	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Where to place my next tattoo?	I've decided I want a tattoo of a feather to symbolise peace and serenity as I'm the type of person that worries and stresses alot so I want something to remind me to chill! lol   So I've found a design I like, but I dont know where to put it. I want it somewhere where I can see it all the time, so that when I'm feeling like that, I'll see it and remember, I dont want to have to look for it on my body to remind myself.   I was thinking my inner wrist but I think the area is too small for the detail it needs.   Also it is a floating feather so it needs to be horizontal not vertical.   Anyone got any ideas for me?

I realize that waxing is probably the best, but I can't really afford to have that done. Granted...I've never had that done and don't really know the costs...but I'd like to do something more at-home.       Well, let's just see, how much is waxing? How do they go about doing it? How long does it last? Is it worth is?       But back to my original question...what do you use to have a nice smooth bikini area that isn't infested with red bumps and stubborn little hairs that'll grow back within a few days?!??

Okay so I just recently started going in a tanning bed and don't give me a lecture because I know it's bad for me but it's my body my choice. But I just wanted to know if it's the more tanning lotion you put on the tanner you get or is it the other way around?
