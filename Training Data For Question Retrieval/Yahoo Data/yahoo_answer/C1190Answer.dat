nk0Ln9gWaa	ok... first your hair needs to be wet (like u coming out of the shower)  then use mouse and scrunch you hair and do the same with gel  now u hairspray to hold it  the ur hair will be nice and curly|`|xOvPuyfHaa	It depends on the hair you have, if you have naturally straight hair, you have to curl it with a curling iron, I can't scrunch my hair like all the people who have naturally curly hair (which I wish SO much to have!)    you could also take a shower at night, and when your hair is damp, french braid (or a normal braid) and sleep on it all night, when you wake up in the morning, you'll have a certain curl and take a small barrel curling iron and take with it. You can go on you tube and people will show you hair tutorials. Some are really cool.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	perm, curling irons, hot rollers.|`|ZkgHQX5haa	perm    you get your hair permanantly straight for a while  or you could put curlers in your hair or curl it|`|pOrwteQUaa	A perm would do the trek.|`|UW97kf4Baa	curling irons, perm, curlers, hair stylist|`|XxR36ICHaa	Several options,   a big berrel curing iron for big sexy hair (lots of hairspray)  You can put your hair in rags over night, by getting it wet, putting gel in it, and taking sections about 1 inch wide, and wraping them around a 3 inch peice of nylon (cut up tights works) then tieing it into a knot. You'll need to do about 30 on your head.  You can get a perm, but I wouldn't recomend it, because they give you the poodle look, unless you're an elderly lady with short hair.  You can get foam or heated curlers, they don't take too long  Best of luck    OH almost forgot... for beach waves, after you shower, when your hair is damp, put gel in it, then tie it into a messy bun ontop of your head, then let it down in the morning (or once it's dry) and apply some mouse. this is the easiest way EVER to do your hair!|`|tsnJGZHCaa	braid it or curling iron|`|YXRjizKtaa	Curling irons.   Hot rollers or any other kind of rollers.  Perm.  Gel scrunch it.|`|tbXdgRXpaa	the easiest way is to use a curling iron or rollers. then put hairspray on top, and the style will stay. =]|`|oyvASkLLaa	Curl it or braid it ever night before you go to sleep
6nvhmx7Aaa	Ok I have to ask is your hair really think? by the way you describe it, you must have a lot of hair to be able to defunk all that anti-poofy stuff.    have you tried thinning your hair? u know those scissors that looks like a comb and cuts sum strands and leaves others?    with thinner hair, you can manage it easier with those products.    also, don't get hair wet before sleeping because that usually ends up pretty bad.    hope that helps|`|H1NjIT10aa	I like Krissi's suggestion.      It sounds like you live in an area that tends to get a bit of humidity.  That is always hard on curly hair.  The humidity make it curl bay up.  You could have it cut into layers so that when it is curly it will look great.  Have you tried to use a flat iron on it.|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	You could braid it or put it up in a ponytail, if you don't mind having it up.    Since you just washed it, why don't you braid it now before it dries, and sleep in it?  Wake up at the same time you would if you were to shower, in case you don't like it.|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Use defrizzer alllll the time thats what I do. It works use it when your hair is damp and also use gel that puts it down a little bit but other than that Idk|`|XSbFL5uAaa	Well, I have really curly hair and have found Burt's Bees moisturizing shampoo and conditioner helped to infuse moisture and get defined curls. I usually try not to use shampoo too much. Also, I like to leave in a little bit of conditioner and rinse my hair under cold water. Also brushing hair (touching it too much) after washing it should be minimalized.

VgRy6jxuaa	The only thing you can do while waiting for them to grow out, is try your best to slick them down with pomade or hairspray or maybe try to manipulate them with a straightener. Side bangs are really cute on everyone. Just let those little ones grow out and start sweeping your bangs to one side with your part and curl slightly under with a straightener.|`|B6xfTbcyaa	you never know unless you try. so if you get side bangs then you can hide your shorter hairs. and if you dont like them just clip them back until they grow out. about your short hairs, i have no idea what they are. are you sure they just arent your baby hairs? mine go crazy all the time. but its natural. other than that im really not sure. GOOD LUCK!|`|SOyU4rp0aa	If you wear your hair up in a ponytail a lot or if you clip your hair back, the explanation for the little hairs is right there. When pressure is put on the hair strand, it will snap. Don't worry, you're not doing anything wrong, it happens to a lot of people and almost everyone who wears their hair in a ponytail.    My suggestion is that you go for the side bangs! They will look really cute and they will hide the little 'baby hairs' that have formed along your hair line. Have them cut longer than you think you would like so that if you don't like them, it is easier to grow them out. If you decide you like them, have them cut a bit shorter!    Here is a folder of pictures of side swept bangs for you to look at so you can pick a style that you like! :D    http://s183.photobucket.com/albums/x237/...|`|hswokvZFaa	yes you should get them(side bangs) because they look really pretty on girls... thats my taste on girls :) but dont worry it will never look bad, you can always change it any way you want. experiment with things, you never know what the out come might be...AND PLEASE do not let you barber decide for your hair... they somehow end up giving the wrong idea...(thats what happened to my mom)|`|WodlreGLaa	you should do side bangs|`|pOrwteQUaa	You better not even think about giving me a thumb down.

But if you get side bangs don't go to hair cuttery to get em done. Mine look terrible and thtas where I went.Lol|`|jXQt5ns5aa	`you should get long hair bangs   ` to hide them you should clip them back with a bobby pin|`|1SWAQe5Raa	i say try with long bangs then go shorter untill you like it|`|f6NcTZyBaa	If you get your hair cut professionally it wont look bad.I was afraid to get my hair cut because I was afraid it would look bad.One night, I just took some scissors and started chopping.I do not recomend this but it turned out good for me!Side bangs would look fine.Just push the lil bangs aside like mini side bangs.I did that nd it worked fine.|`|0XWVUMCAaa	well i was going  to tell you to use gel  just wear a hat
H1NjIT10aa	I'd talk to a good stylist/colorist.  You might be able to let it grow out for a while then maybe a good colorist could match the gray.  another option would be to do grayish highlights...  That way as it grows out it won't be as noticeable.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	nothing sorry. You either have to color it or wait it out.|`|XxR36ICHaa	Go to your salon! they'll be able to strip the dye out, and re dye it grey, that's what my grandmother did, once she got tired of hiding it.    Grey hair looks really nice on woman, especially when it's long!    Best of luck, and God Bless|`|WPRAfLO7aa	Um dye it gray? Lmao, i don't what else to do.|`|pdtAmIPyaa	ummm...my mom almost just got it stripped...but that is pretty hard on ur hair....idk...see someone in a salon bout it|`|w7m52T9Waa	dye it the exact same colour as your natural.|`|YAozHqSYaa	color it gray or wait. that's all i think you could do.
lZ9Dl5Nhaa	I know you've heard this enough, but your hair is absolutely gorgeous!  If you don't want to use hot tools, you can always but it in a ponytail, or a bun with some curly pieces hanging out. Or, you could braid it.  What's really pretty on girls with curly hair is when they put it in a half pony tail.  This may or may not work, but you could alse change your part once in a while.  And if you're a fan of pigtails, you could do that too, but that might not work with your curls.      And of course, there's always a flat iron.  But I noticed you don't really want to use one.  Maybe if you defined the curls a little more with the curling iron, that would be pretty too! :]    Whatever you do, though, don't fry your gorgeous locks.|`|JsuQEvrDaa	i wish i had your hair|`|w7m52T9Waa	straight, waved, beach loose waves|`|KZ9ZE3yJaa	your really pretty :)    Layers would go great on you.     then if you do get them layers you can get it straightened|`|f6NcTZyBaa	OMG I would kill for your hair!I can't curl mine!:/ You could just straighten it.Try putting it up in like a ponytail or braid.The braid might take a while so try that like the night before or something so you don't mess it up because you don't have time.|`|p7KbhFEeaa	ommfg, i love your hair, your gorgeous. I think that maybe you should straighten it. And also you can straighten it and then put it in pig tail and either wear it like that or wet the pig tails and sleep in them then it comes out wavy... try side bangs. and head bands.!   LOVE YOUR HAIR THOUGH|`|XRzSxgUnaa	omg. You have great curls! I am so jealous.      You could try a cute side ponytail.      Look on youtube I always find great ideas on there!|`|WnG55RAlaa	loose braids oh and btw ur hair is soo freakin pretty i would kill for your hair!|`|K9EYCVICaa	hey its me again lol i feel so stupid i added u as a friend but how do I communicate wt u now???

It's too boring. Even if it's just long layers, any kind of layers. And straighten it every once in a while but I like it curly! Alot of women would pay big money for hair to curl like that! :]|`|glynFK9haa	It's nice the way it is, really.  Do what you want, though.|`|HjcT7ngKaa	straightening it, ponytails.      ur hair is super pretty :]|`|h3rN7snkaa	I think your hairs really pretty! I wouldn't change it, it makes you stand out more. Try maybe getting some honey, or golden, darker blonde highlights to spruce it up a little.   And again, gorgeous locks!|`|uiQlTx3waa	i say, invest in some fun hair clips.  you have gorgeous hair, and your beautiful btw.   experiment with different types of ponytails.  loose ones, tight ones, high ones, low ones  side ponytails, or even putting it half up, with some loose hair falling down.

URLq6zIDaa	dont do it yourself..you wont be able to get the right needle size, and therefore no belly button ring will fit. seriously, i did it, and had to get it fixed.. just go get it pierced professionally, its only like $40.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Sure, if you don't mind intense pain and severe infection.     Duh.    Get it done professionally.|`|qxAcwDsjaa	dont listen to them. ive done every single one of my (many) piercings myself. as long as you sterilize the needle (or in my case large safety pin) and the area to be pierced (alcohol pads ^_^) you'll be fine. keep it clean. the way i did my belly button, i pierced it with a large safety pin, pierced it, closed the safety pin, and wait until it almost heals. then you can gauge it to belly button ring size and wait for it to finish healing. while healing, i kept mine covered in neosporin and a large bandaid.|`|QwBepNBuaa	you could do it but it would get really infected and grose so its better to get it down at a piercing place :)|`|8e6z8iUHaa	I pierced my own belly button, but my parents made me take it out and it got infected. The safest way to do it is to get it done professionally, but it's important that you take good care of the piercing because it will get infected really easily and if they mess it up they could cause some serious damage to yur reproductive system and what not. be careful.|`|dx9AZ16Paa	well i got my done professionally for 10$.  but you could do it.  just feel yr navel and get the loose part.  get a 16gage needle numb yr belly button will ice,  take a lighter and burn the needle.  sick it threw and and hurry and put the belly ring it,  i think they sale self piercing kits at walmart.|`|q4qkixu8aa	I know that my friends and i tried this a long time ago with a large sewing needle and it didn't work at all! but i got mine done professionally last year and it hurt pretty badly and it still got infected and i did everything i was told but if you want it done that badly i would advise that you get it done professionally because i know that because mine got infected it left an ugly scar.|`|FW93xc6Raa	You could.. but I wouldn't suggest it.  It's not the brightest idea.  Been there, done that.  I used an upholstery needle.  It took hours and hurt like hell. And that was with ice.  I'm guessing because you are asking you aren't old enough to go get it done professionally without your parent's permission.  Tell them you want it, talk to them about it.  If they still don't want you to get it, I suggest waiting until you can get it professionally done.  Mine worked, but I didn't grab enough skin and all it took to rip it out was my dog jumping on the ring and pulling it out of my naval.  I ended up having to wait a few months for the skin to heal so I could get it done professionally.  4 years later, I still have a scar where it was ripped out.
ENilx3F2aa	The beauty of white is that it compliments all skin tones. If you feel uncomfortable with wearing pure white don't fret as there are various shades of white that can also work with all skin tones as well. Dare To Be Different!|`|AA11560862	Definitely. It brings out the nice color of your skin.   In fact white looks good on all skin tones. I'm pretty sallow in the wintertime, so when I wear white, I look like I have some pink tones to me.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	sure it does :) when i go tanning i actually carry off light colors better. The light color compliments your skin color! Have fun!!|`|BZt3Z1gYaa	nope not at all....unless you have a caramel color (skin) and kan work with it... most the time a light color(white,sky blue,orange,etc) dont6 look good with a dark tone(cuz it makes you look more darker then you seen)|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Yes. White look nice on tan dark skinned people.|`|qQSbdcVYaa	yes black people wear white clothes|`|F8OrjeWsaa	it goes alright, but perhaps you should try for a cream, not a snow white.|`|Rt6ajbqoaa	yes it looks awesome|`|RJlaACWBaa	i personally dont like wearing white, but thats just because im sorta messy :/  but u should wear what you feel comfortable in, dont care what people think, if you want to wear white wear it.
62T9Kozfaa	haha the answer above is cool [:    and i dont know i have never heard of someone that has it but it does look good
fEhR7bOMaa	Skinny Jeans, converse shoes, and a cute t-shirt is cute and layed back - and comfy!    Throw on a cool jacket and its great :)|`|y46ZQItQaa	A loose , but fashionable sweater . ( maybe billabong or roxy , try sweaters around those brands though , or skater types ) as for pants , a pair of lululemon pants , TNA's ( if you live  in canada , those are expensive brands though ) Theres also american eagle sweats , OOOOOOOOH , HOW ABOUT slippers , loose sweater , and a sexy pair of pj bottoms , ( hollister and abercrombie have REALLY cutte ones )|`|ZYJn4BH5aa	i would say skinny jeans and a graphic tee or a plain colored v-neck   t-shirt   also a swetshirt is causual buts its not cute|`|4EIebdn1aa	Skinny jeans or a miniskirt in a tank top or graphic layered tee shirt.|`|lpeOwnGRaa	I wonder the same thing!!!!  I'm a girl, but sometimes I'll wear one of those long knit sweaters. Those look kinda cute I think|`|HvxKb4gIaa	laid back is something simple. i'd wear dark straight jeans, a not-too-tight v-neck shirt that goes awesome with my skintone, a different colored belt (that still matches the shirt) and depending on weather, boots, converse/vans, flip flops/sandals that are the same color as the belt. simple, comfortable, chic. hahaha. :] hope i helped.    and if it's cold, a nice jacket/sweater that goes nicely with the colors of the other pieces.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Skinny jeans, a plaid shirt, and flats. I think that looks really cute and laid back :) Just make sure the plaid shirt is fitted, and if it isn't, belt it at the waist. The jeans don't have to be super skinny, but I don't think a flare or boot cut would look as cute.
260e84bc4b8c17ca7160d4229c91e59caa	Go to a salon and ask about MAINTAMER I believe its by ISO. Works beautifully! Its a relaxer with little or no damage!|`|VuSQD0xCaa	honey i dont know but when u find out let me know!|`|GJS28K5kaa	u could try TRESemme heat tamer spray it seems to work for me|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Use a frizz serum or try rubbing dryer sheets on your head.
DYQkOIXVaa	cool;)|`|igrdohopaa	Ew gay lol|`|8np3kmvyaa	cool|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	In my opinion, it would normally be a guy who would wear that.|`|p3qrj7HDaa	I think guys that wear necklaces are hot :) The one in the pic works, but those guitar pick necklaces are getting a little trendy, so that diminishes the cool factor a bit - just keep the necklaces short, and masculine - NO gold chains :)    In my opinion at least|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	i don't think that is a girl's necklace. i think it was meant 4 a guy. i don't know any girls who wear guitar picks around their necks.|`|wY2k1cHVaa	Not at all. I dislike it sorry. But i don't think guys should wear any necklaces at all.|`|32bOu0wpaa	If my boyfriend ever wore a necklace like that i would steal it in the middle of the night and destroy it. It is ugly.|`|mRQ5SqySaa	the colors are kind of gay.|`|UXFE87Toaa	I don't like it when guys wear those stuff  i mean there not girls in my school i never saw a boy with something like that not even a neck less   i think u should not get   itt|`|6PF6oNBKaa	Yeah.....I don't think so......=/ I really don't like guys that wear jewelry It's a bit big and bold for a guy.|`|hO5yWdvmaa	to be quite honest; it looks a little bit silly, but hey if you like it you like it can't let other people decide things for you :D|`|ip0VuS3Daa	it would depend on how you look, but it looks fine.|`|ouosH0t8aa	gross.    but I think band-labeled clothes in general look bad.|`|yP6Rrlgraa	I think that u will look wonderful!|`|Nm3i0WDtaa	i like it, boss .|`|2AHMMZ0kaa	its awesome go for it|`|kIm84ayNaa	Erm...|`|KR5lvWdpaa	it looks cheap.    and silly.

H1NjIT10aa	Your hair probably tends to be on the dry side.  You need to keep it hydrated with some really good conditioner.  Before you straighten it.  that will help counter act the heat you need to straighten you curls.      At some point you may need to look at your hair realisitcally.  If you can't have it professionally done you may just have to learn a way to style it that looks great for your more ethnic hair type.      Sometimes no matter how we would love to wear our hair, they type of hair we have just doesn't allow for that.|`|ENilx3F2aa	A relaxer is a great option if you want a permanent change to the texture of your hair as you will only have to relax your hair every 4-6+ weeks. On the other hand if you love your curly lock and are just looking for a quick change that is not permanent try salerm. Try using large steam rollers. It add moisture back in you hair and gets rid of the frizz. Once you have your curls wrap your hair and you will see volume.|`|W1gzD1sAaa	use a relaxer|`|pGBTHEjtaa	Ask a hair stylist

URLq6zIDaa	you will see the color difference.. i don't know why you would cover it? i had a friend who did that and you could see the line where the towel covered her face.|`|vIUS5J3paa	Don't have to if you don't wanna. And plus your face and other parts of your body will look different colors of pigment.|`|Zqr4D4Egaa	If you'd like a pale face and tanned body, yes.|`|P667pOpgaa	well if you do that than you may have a tan body but a white face.  I always tan myself with my face exposed.  I hear that it is bad for your eyes but just like close them and focus on something else.   DO NOT WEAR SUNGLASSES.   I was stupid enough to go play with the kids with my sunglasses on and than tan WITH the sunglasses on and when I took them off I had a nice white sunglass tan...It was really bad. Just dont make a mistake like that! haha  but yeah I keep my face exposed.|`|4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	That depends? Do you want your face or a leather handbag?    Cover your face. You can always manipulate the color with self tanner for your face, make up, and bronzer.     I went to high school with these girls who tanned everyday...their body and their face....and I see these people on myspace now...Im 28....and they look well into their 30s and 40s. Can you imagine. Being 28 and being accused of being 45?! That is what the tanning will do. I gaurentee it. It may not show up now, but a few more years of tanning and you will be sad to see the aging face in the mirror. SPF it girl!
r4xRkqzdaa	check out urban decay and make up forever... you'll fall in love with their products!    they are super high quality and can create some really unique eye looks    urban decay website: http://www.urbandecay.com/index.cfm?CFID...  make up forever  makeup forever:  http://www.makeupforever.com/    ''how to'' you tube users:  -petrilude  -misschevious  you tube tutorials are great ways to get new ideas!|`|cc907ba0da91b4e628fce923bcff1c26aa	You, Missy, are right on track with your current makeup techniques  - not over-the-the-top overdone nor "plain-jane" underdone. It appears you've found a foundation that is a very close match to your own skin tone - that is perhaps the most important thing to get right as it is called a "foundation" for a reason.  Anything else you do to enhance your face with makeup is built upon that first.    That said, your face is very stunning, great bone structure, i.e. - perfect jawline, high cheekbones, eyes balanced on your face and not only a gorgeous color, but the their shape is interestingly unique and your brow bone and forehead are also is in perfect balance with the perimeter of your face.    So, you are just a bored aspiring super model, right? Did I see one of those Marilyn Monroe "angel kisses" (mole) sitting lonely next to your nose/lips? Accentuate this, make it a signature for your face's personality.  Try using an eye brow pencil in maybe one or two shades of brown lighter than your hair color. Place the sharpened tip of the pencil directly on the mole and gently twist it back and forth between your forefinger and thumb. Poof - movie star magic!    Also, with your smooth, satiny skin tone, you can try another thing, that, although simple, if done in moderation and in colors that are right for you, will not come off as "clownish" and in fact, will had a whole new dimension of fun to your makeup techniques. Simply do this: every time you select a new shade of lipstick you like in either matte or shine for your lips, also select a frosted version of the same exact shade of lipstick to use as your predominant eye shadow color. The trick here is the application - use a medium rounded makeup brush and a light touch at first until you get the exact drama you like without going over the top. Have fun!    PS - DO NOT fire your hairstylist, the cut you currently have is a master piece of perfection in framing your face shape. Whoever cut your hair is a genius - tell them Max said its a "WOW"!     - Maximilian|`|GxbXseoqaa	i likeit. but add some color too. like consider wearing eye shadows that bring out your eyes|`|KNTSXHC4aa	You can try using different materials like liquid eyeliner or putting a light, pearly eyeshadow on the brow bone. Also, look on youtube for makeup tutorials. They often have different types of styles from basics to crazy styles (like leopard print eyeshadow). There are also style books from MAC that are pretty fun (maccosmetics.com). Lastly, just play with makeup. I personally like to do a simple cat eye or cover my entire lid in a taupe-y brown that wings out. They're casual but still stylish.|`|S7VekdDuaa	Your really pretty!!!!!! But you should try using some bright colors on your eyes!!! I would try lime green or a bright orange! Or purple!!! Good luck! I'm sure you'll look great no matter what you decide to do!^.^

g4h9SosCaa	Non-guaged.    The guaged look might be cool and badass now (I'm guessing you're a teen?) But think about this....your skin isn't always going to be this elastic.  Give it twenty years and having these huge holes in your lobes is going to look dumb.  Thirty or more years and your skin will droop and you'll have tear-shaped flaps of skin hanging down to your shoulders.  Think about that and how you'd like to be percieved as an adult in the professional world.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	some gauges are attractive on girls if they can pull it off.  sorry but you cant wear regular earings anymore. when you go past 00g, it wont go back to normal.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	well once you stretch you'll never be able to wear cute "normal" earings again|`|EyAAFfaMaa	EWWWWWW!

H1NjIT10aa	Stephen I am so sorry for your loss.  Loosing a parent is never pleasant and I know it has got to be even more difficult at your young age.    Yes, Stress can cause hair loss.  And bad diet can cause hair loss combined with the stress.    Yes male pattern baldness can start as young as 19.  Even younger!  I was in HS with a guy who was wearing "The Comb Over" at 17!  A teenager can even start to turn gray as a teen too.    At some point you might want to consider hair transplants as a remedy to your MPB...  You can get it done fairly cheaply in Costa Rica with excellent doctors.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	I am not from Australia, but since I have used some good drugstore products (and no one's answered this) I'm betting they might have some of them over there too.     Here goes: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, and red Cream of Nature shampoo  Do you have an organic/specialty store (like whole foods)? Some of my fav products from there: Giovanni Direct Leave in condish (uder gel again), G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel    I have curly hair and have used all of those successfully at some point. You also probably want to check out these forums. Just do a post like "Australian curly products?!" in general curl talk and they'll be a lot better response than Y!A:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)

VJpdmd0waa	I have mine done on both sides on my cartilage  It doesnt hurt to get it done but hurt for me when i slept.  But if you get a smaller earring then you should be ok.  I have big diamonds so that's why it hurt...   But im ok now..  Good Luck!|`|tYMOpAmIaa	i have the top of my ear pierced, and out of all the piercings ive had it hurt the most (i got it done with a gun)  and it hurts when you sleep on it too.  try the tragus, that didnt hurt at all (:|`|zXcR3Tgoaa	my best friends sister got her ears pierced there. Shes also an professional piercer. She told me if I was going to get my cartilage pierced that I should get pierced it by an needle and not a a gun. A gun hurts more, a needle is more disinfected. I dont know if because Im not her. hope this helps (:
FDBJs1lOaa	An eyebrow piercing honestly isn't as bad as it may seem. Although it is piercing through a much thicker piece of skin than your lip, as long as you are will to take proper care of it and allow it to have a good healing process, you will be just fine. I suggest getting it because it is an awesome piercing :)|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Theres going to be any pain in a  piercing. The only thing you need to be concerned with is it worth the pain?|`|dZtToTIbaa	I've had mine done for almost a year now.  I was expecting it to be painful because plucking in that area is kinda painful.  But when he put the needle through i could barely feel it, it didn't hurt at all.  It was a little sore then next few days but it wasn't bad at all.  I'd say go for it!|`|WKdGhRYcaa	psh shouldnt be that bad im 15 and EVERYBODY in my high school got there lips tounge ears eyebrows bellybutton chin(snakebites) and other places pierced but i dont think eyebrow hurts|`|OzXnC8iGaa	WELL I fgot my anti eyebrow  done boiut three weeks ago and the pain was a five my lip piercing was a 1 and the anti is a surfac flat bone piercing so my com=nclusion is a 3 or a 4|`|IuEro9Xnaa	well, your eyebrows arent use to the piercing yet.  its like getting braces, first it doesnt hurt, then the pain starts kicking in. im sure you'll be okay, because eyebrow peircings can hurt.|`|zXcR3Tgoaa	my best friends sister got her eye brow pierced and shes a pofessional piercer. I dont know what it feels like but she told me that she had her eyebrows pierced 5 times, and it feels like a quick pinch and then pressure, standardly most eyebrow piercings hurt less then ear piercings, there is a rare case where someone says it hurts really bad but that is very rare.|`|c5anDswjaa	Pain is always different for each person.. I got my eyebrow pierced about 2 years ago and it didnt hurt at all.. But that doesnt mean it wont for you, youll just have to get it done and find out for yourself!|`|i22lvJYsaa	My cousin got it, and said it hurt like a *****|`|LN6AskZhaa	eye brow piercing does hurt. You should be okay though.
O7LYxbKlaa	Sally's Beauty Supply.  They are $3 each.  Hope i helped :)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	hot topic they have many colors and variaties  here:    http://search.hottopic.com/search?p=Q&ts...    all are $9.99 :]|`|pOYsO3xzaa	wal mart,k mart,any hair salon probebly 15 bucks|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	A beauty supply store.|`|9HjMkhaCaa	usually in hair salons, most are designed by jessica simpson and have her picture on them, they range from like 10-30 dollars|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Sally's but they can get really expensive.|`|Csg5qnHhaa	WHAT DO YOU THINK?!    hmm.. a petstore?

Wal-mart DOESN'T have them.  But try      Sallys, Claires, or even if you have just a regular hair salon around your area, just go there.  Although, it DOES depend on what kind you get.  The REALLY good ones can usually sell for $100+  but, if you just got regular ones, $20-30+  and, the fake cheap ones are like $10-        :)
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You can have your hair permanently straightened.  Pros:  straighter hair  Cons:  expensive ($200)  not actually permanent (roots will be curly in 4-6 months)  damaging chemical treatment (esp. for dyed or permed hair)    So I would also say your best bet is to try spending a little money looking for products that make your hair look nice curly. Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair.

For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method!

UByvC54Xaa	Rosemary stimulates hair growth, but in all honesty, you can dread your hair when it is only 3 inches long!!! Starting off with short dreads usually results in better dreads as they mature. Also, once your hair is dreaded - it does seem to get longer quicker. not sure how that works but it does.|`|9iXGakohaa	There isn't any way to make your hair grow faster. However, by making sure your hair is healthy you can ensure it grows as much as it is able.     Use a good shampoo/conditioner and deep condition every few weeks.     Make sure you get a trim every month to keep your split ends away will strengthen your hair and keep it healthy.     Taking vitamins, eating healthy, and drinking a lot of water will encourage healthy hair as well.    Good luck!|`|wi59vRgmaa	me too! no ones answering my question about baby dreadlocks though, they just keep telling me it'll look ugly!  sorry im really not helping, but i will be ecstatic if anyone gives you a straight answer that i can read also.|`|dqe30Pciaa	use leangth and streangth shampoos and conditioners and be sure to keep your split ends cut off =)|`|htp2kx9Iaa	i think you should just not get any .|`|IGXE3aDraa	hair grows a a specified speed there isn't really anything to get it to grow faster. if your talking about locking up faster try the lock accelerator on this web site also there shampoo is great.     www.dreadheadhq.com
9RTuRPviaa	Is the one you bought the one that has the powder and brush in one piece (powder in the bottom, that should distribute as you brush it, and a brush on the top)?   If it is, i had trouble opening that one too. I think you have to dig thru the brush and pull a plastic stopper out of the middle.  When i Finally got it, the powder would never come out right. It would either dump a big clump of powder or none at all.   Hope it works better for you because i was not impressed lol

LBHJaqXoaa	I would be more concerned over the smell than the pain. Imagine white-hot metal being applied to your ribs and held there a few seconds. OUCH. And you'll have some residual pain for a few hours afterwards too. You've burned your finger before... Just apply that to your ribs and that's how painful a branding would be.     A few days of pain for a lifetime of cool walking art. Your choice.|`|yvtGL6RTaa	that is one of the worst pains ever...|`|YEvRFqJ8aa	I have a brand on my left arm of a horseshoe for luck, and it hurt like a mofo!I would also like to add that I am heavily tattooed and the tattoos were nothing compared to the branding!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	A brand is either a chemical burn or a second degree heat burn.    It's incredibly painful, I've never seen video of someone getting one without making the most horrible pained faces.
KKxX5wszaa	Try to give him reasons why he should let you grow it out.  Ask him why he won't let you grow it out.  There must be a reason behind everything.  Once you find out what the reasons are, try to find positive benefits to your long hair. He'll of course ask you, " Why do you want to grown out long hair?". Then you'll have a good explanation on why you want to grow it out. He'll probably give in if you have a good counter example. I hoped that I helped!|`|46nFI18Haa	tell him to go fck himself.   thats what i did  i live alone now.|`|UHpqcG9Vaa	just tell him, that this is your style. your dad's old fashion style shouldn't rub off on you. i hate how dads do that, but grow your hair out and tell him that this is how you want it, and have it long enough where your dad is okay with. sholder length is kinda long.|`|U1WUNCwLaa	long hair is grimy and gay|`|zWB3jHHPaa	tell your dad to get off your nuts and let you live. lol  jk. i dk. i convince my parents to let me smoke years ago without bitching, so either your dad's uber stubborn or your not a good debater (=|`|tpIQXRYraa	well that can be tricky; just say that everyone in school has it and if you don't you will be called a nerd or something. or you can make a statement and were lots of eyeliner, im a girl so it's easy for me, well sorta i want a few piercings but my mom wont let me get them. umm, lets see be four you do all of this, are you trying to be "emo"? if you are you should no this: emo is a metric style of music, very hardcore screamo type. if you don't want to be called a poser never sayEMo unless yourmakingg fun of a prep or talking about music.

HnTpvVEEaa	first you need 2 stop coloring ur hair! its horrible for it, breaks off, stunts growth and damages it. then u must cut off all damaged hair or u will see no growth for the ends will break faster than it grows. do not straighten just one use of a heat iron does lots of damage and breaks the cuticle. wash every 3 days instead of every day and only use the best shampoo the cheap **** will hurt u in the long run. always condition after shampooing.and heat up olive oil in microwave and leave in hair 4 3O mins.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Rub olive oil into the scalp and massage to promote hair growth , leave for 1 hour and wash.

I would love to get it to grow faster, so i asked my hair-dresser.

Yue2YKTnaa	St Ives apricot scrub in %2 salicylic acid for acne fighting and moisturizer  its only like $3-4
AA10702820	Models for makeup DO wear makeup but its also airbrushed. Every ad is airbrushed.  In this case, I'd like to think that Adriana Lima ('think thats who the model in the link is) is wearing false lashes. You can get your eyelashes like that if you put a lot of mascara on but it can also be really clumpy and gross.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	A girl at my school has make up like that. I havent asked her, but im guessing you put on A LOT, and not just one type|`|OhPNPR1Xaa	Chances are it is|`|r5oL56xCaa	well, like all pictures for advertisement, it is computer edited, but they do try to get it as perfect as possible, they have professional make-up artist, and they hire people that specially set the models face, and her surroundings so things look absolutely great. it is actually a long and hard procedure to get it to look that way|`|Yue2YKTnaa	its fake  they wear fake lashes and they are edited|`|qgimQqhmaa	whenever people do photo shoots for makeup adds, its always photoshopped. usually only true makeup artists can make you look that good. so basically its fake.. but real i geuss? with the help of a computer.|`|lMRTJKQsaa	I'm guessing it's edited. But remember, less is more when it comes to most makeup!|`|oND37Cflaa	it is edited advertisements usually are but if you have mascara that doesnt give enough volume use a eyelash curler.|`|vhXbGB8naa	It's not just the make up, it's good skin too. But that is definitely photoshopped.|`|UCgNMbkDaa	actually its real makeup and the photo is not edited.  however the shooting of the photo is.   they probably are using filters, such as those used in glamour shots to soften her face.  also, she probably is wearing lash extensions.|`|lxLeeYA5aa	Thats definately photoshoped.. if you want eyelashes like that, buy false lashes and put mascara on after you applied them!    As for the makeup, you need good brushes. Try mac, they have the best makeup and accessories.    Hope this helps :).|`|cDn9bhcGaa	Not necessarily - but that is NOT how your eyes will look if you use their Mascara...    There are a LOT of tricks they use in ads/commercials - including:    * Airbrushing.  * Using Fake Eyelashes - and applying the "lengthening" mascara on top of THOSE.  * Applying a coat of Lash Primer onto those fake lashes before the mascara (for even more length).    And so on.  And being a Print Ad (rather than a commercial) - it could easily be Photoshopped (somewhat) on top of all that...    Notice how EVERYTHING looks flawless - makeup, hair, skin.  Who REALLY looks THAT good naturally ;););)|`|oIUNvpYFaa	Falsies, and perfect foundation. To make any makeup look good it takes a lot of practice.|`|cjlWiqqCaa	It looks like they put lots of mascara on then put false eyelashes on then they probably edited it so its perfect|`|oRRelET4aa	looks edited to me.
NHKOVg4Taa	Yes I totally agree with one of the answers, drinking water is essential about 8-10 glasses a day.  It does clear up the pores in your skin.    I would also like to say try to reduce fatty foods, soda drinks and junk food as much as you can to avoid the build up of grease on the skin.    Finally exercise regularly, apart from getting you fit it more importantly reduces your stress levels which is another factor causing acne.    Hope this is helpful.|`|B4lMcm89aa	It does. It flushes the toxins out of the body. You should be aiming for 2 litres a day. I drink 1.5 litres because otherwise I get a migraine|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yes it does because when you drink water and then urinate it is flushing all of those toxins and oil out of your body that causes you to have acne. When you don't drink this water you are not washing it out of your system so it exits out of the pores in your face causing you to have acne. You are suppose to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water which is 1 cup of water or 8 oz (which are the same) 8 to 10 times a day which really isn't a lot. Do not drink them repeatedly after each other or drink a lot at one time because you can kill yourself because you can get poisoned from water because your organs are floating it water. So do gaps or put the 64 oz (8 cups of water) in a water bottle and sip it throughout the day. 64 oz is how much you need per day but 8 oz is how much you need per time you drink.    Good Luck  (Also it helps for my face and my sister's is starting to clear up after I told her about this)    Also wash your face every night before you go to bed with a mild soap to clean all of the oil and dirt that is on your face from being outside.|`|ttbho89Vaa	mmmnope.. sorry doesnt help.. try proactive or clearasil! sorry:]
11b09bb2ce3a335fe5c99c70ade79ccdaa	To be hydrated, you should drink 8 glasses of water every day.  However, hydration has nothing to do with acne.|`|cnVUWDcUaa	30.    But I think that is a myth.|`|yCsR9fROaa	Does not help at all...research shows that water only can help u get fit with your body and not your face. Things with a lot of sugar need to be cut down and don't touch your face with the palms and fingers on your hand because the natural oils on your hands can corrupt the balance of oil on your face and then the leftover oil turns to acne. Just cut the sugar out of your diet and use acne medication and wash your face consistently. Drinking water does not help acne at all!|`|KLZ7WFiQaa	10    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|5LeLIHJZaa	64oz...not sure how many glasses that is....I think around 8?

Hope I helped :)|`|B2tYVGe6aa	the dress with the bottom|`|JCBmMtqZaa	they are both lovely but the second one definitely has my vote.|`|nF3AbLBWaa	they both are super cute, but I'd pick the second one, she would be more comfortable, and in the first one the socks would keep falling down.|`|MwvA8v17aa	i would say the second outfit    the jeans skirt might be okay with leggings though, that would be cute
j6PrOaZgaa	use a big barrel curling iron after you blow dry it     use anti frizz or hairspray to make it smoother.    whenever i curl my hair i usually straighten it a day before, then the next day i curl it( that way i dont have to worry about blowdrying or frizz)    also, it looks like the girl twisted the curling iron towards the back, not inward. so make sure you practice with your curling iron to see what ways you use it and how it affects the look. i would practice before i actually wear it in public. unless of course you do really well on the first shot!!|`|1VOaqCvXaa	lotsssss of hairspray too.|`|KdNbFB6Eaa	curling-iron and hairspray|`|sGmMbLLoaa	you use a 2 inch barrel curling iron...make sure it is really hot because it will work better and faster.  then you take large sections at a time to get a bigger curl/wave

And the tattoo is OK too.|`|pluEas6maa	It's okay, but tattoos don't do anything for a girl's body. If anything, I would advise some color. But think it thriugh first, because it doesn't make you cool and you can't make it go away once you get it.    BY THE WAY IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME KIND OF COUNTRYS ROYAL FAMILIES.|`|EXWpMIZJaa	yea its cute!!! i would sooo get it!|`|9cBLKOe8aa	Does have any meaning to you? Or are you just doing it because it's "cool/sexy", never ever get a tattoo just because you think it's "cool/sexy".  That's the dumbest reason to get inked.|`|aygUtJ1Raa	Meh. If you're getting it to look sexy, it's just a tramp stamp. Think of how it'll look when you're 70. Seem as good?  If it means anything to you, get it. Otherwise, google 'sexy tattoos' or 'tramp stamps' no offense, and you'll find one better.|`|NCl7B7diaa	Its cute. Go for something a little more unique.
KPsWriOOaa	Do you still have hairs left or does the skin feel a bit bumpy? Veet wax strips don't grasp the really small hairs and therefore leave a slight stubble feeling. Or it could be that your skin gets irritated after waxing and is left bumpy (what happens to me). If it feels bumpy, it usually goes away by the next day. I recommend you use Sally Habsen All-Over Body Wax Extra Strength. It is awesome! Waxes ALL the hairs off. No matter what you decide to use, sensitive areas will become irritated after plucking 500 hairs all at once! lol. Just make sure the wax is not too hot :)
N7CJSTr1aa	1. Wash your face A LOT! I'm sure you've already been doing that, though  2. Use one of the following:   - Garnier Deep Scrub Gel  - Neutrogena Deep Clean  - Clinique clarifying lotion  - Estee Lauder Clean Finish  Hope that pimple's gone soon!|`|7nGwou8uaa	you could try icing it, it works for me. like 5 minutes like 2 times a day.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	cover it with concealer and apply foundation over it then set it with loose powder|`|L4RAKdbSaa	you can try tea tree oil and try putting it on 3 times a day itll be gone in no timee   p.s it stinkss|`|xFhfOpD3aa	What is it with all these toothpaste answers?  It doesn't work -- and I think that's a complete myth.     Tea Tree oil definitely helps, and will reduce redness.  If you simply have to pop it, wash your hands first, then use a tissue between your fingers to squeeze it.  Even after washing your hands you can squeeze more dirt into the zit and cause more of a problem.      Either way, the best method is to wash your face 2x a day, and keep your hands away from it!      Hope that helps! :)|`|suVispAAaa	I would not pop it like some one else said because then it will be come really red & could even become infected. You could put toothpaste on it to dry it out, i have used that in the past & it works wonders on the dreadful zits!! You could also use like proactive, or a strong face cream 3 times a day to help dry up the pimple. Other things you could do to dry up your pimple fast would be:    - Drink lots of water throughout the day to flush the toxins out of your body which might help to lighten your condition    - Cleanse your skin 3-5 times daily with a specialized acne cleanser or an unscented soap.    - Exercise regularly to reduce your stress level which will indirectly help to improve your skin condition    - Lime juice mixed with groundnut oil may be good treatment for acne and pimples    - Apply a bit of toothpaste on the affected area before bed to reduce irritation and redness.    - Mix three table spoons of pure honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder. Apply it on the pimples and leave it there overnight. Wash it the following morning with warm water. Continue this for several weeks to achieve results.     If this doesnot work you might have to just cover it up with make-up. Good Luck =)|`|1VOaqCvXaa	put tooth paste on it over night, it will dry up and by the end of the day tomorrow if it is white at the tip, pop that sucker! then peel it off. haha gross, i know..but it works for me and doesn't leave a scar or anything.|`|KrqGoxoUaa	get a facial|`|8KB98h02aa	put some toothpaste on it every night.

It will only get redder and maybe form a scar, which will look worse. I have heard that some people use toothpaste to help dry them up.|`|QiGj0jNEaa	toothpaste. do a strong mint toothpaste just put a dab on and leave it till it hardens then put more on and repeat.    or   get neutrogena acne spot remover and put that on as often as you can.      but if neither of those work one of them should though you can always try popping the pimple and or wearing coverup over it.|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	Those are the hardest to get rid of.     I would use whatever medicine you've got religiously, keep it clean. Sulfur based cream can work, clearasil makes one, but it does stink, so I would only wear it at night unless you don't mind stinking during the day. I would also invest in a green tinted concealer and a concealer with salicylic acid that matches your skin tone, as well as a foundation brush (sonia kashiuk, target) or make-up application sponges. As far as brand for the concealer, physician's formula is good and long-wearing. Use a dab, blend the edges, let dry, then use a foundation that matches your skin tone and blend edges with foundation brush, finish with powder. You may also need to invest in an oil-free moisturizer, one formulated for people with acne-prone skin. You'll have to wear make-up all over your face if you do this. For concealing tips, check the manufacturer's website or the product use description at a site like drugstore.com.    P.S. Toothpaste can actually make things worse, don't use it.     http://acne.about.com/od/acnefaqs/f/toot...|`|d9WUbMBmaa	Squeeze it. That'll be a really satisfying pop. Or put a little toothpaste on the top to dry it out.|`|0vtNJ2Ipaa	pop it. duh|`|K9SmiHX6aa	dry it out with alchol|`|uKBJniEKaa	Put white toothpaste on it before you go to bed.

Take as prescribed with a big intake of "who gives a F if you don't like the way I look", & the show will be yours!|`|TAuiUNpnaa	wind-ex--this isn't a joke because i wanna use the joke from My Big Fat Greek Wedding, no wind-ex has the same effect as rubbing alcohol ( i would go through fancy terms and ingredients but i think i would bore you) so it will dry it up. after it seems to be going away (the next day) then u should put some lotion or moisturizer on it. then do it one more time and it should be gone the next day.    Don't hold this against me if it doesn't work. I don't know your face. it doesn't work on all people but hey its worth a shot right?     oh and once you put the wind-ex on there don't touch your face you will just put more oil in it and it will just negate what u just did.  hope this helps    toothpaste might work too overnight but be sure to moisturize  good luck with your show!
8oCwrIR2aa	No.    First, any myth you've heard about hair and its removal affecting the hair that grows back is untrue. Hair is exactly what it is. When you shave a leg, for example, exactly the same hair grows back. It seems thicker at first because it is stubbly: the thickest part was the base and that's what's being pushed out, and it is cut across rather than grown to a tapering end so it feels thicker and less fine. But it isn't. Let it grow several weeks and it is just as fine looking as before and as you see it's new taper from the side as it bends, it looks less thick than the just beginning to show stubble did against a very bare leg.    That illustrates the whole subject of hair myths. If you was any hair, it will grow back just like it was. Over some years during your middle childhood, "what it is" is slowly changing, with a few fast jumps, much like growth spurts in height. But the changes would happen exactly so whether the hair is let go, cut, waxed, or whatevered.    That said, consider exactly what cheek hair might currently be like. If it is still peach fuzz: it hasn't much color and takes weeks to grow to any kind of length, and has funny bends sometimes, then any removal of it, waxing or shaving, whatever, will leave a hair that takes weeks to grow back, is fine rather than thick while doing so, and is currently pretty devoid of color. So, you wax off what is there at present, and for those few weeks, you have that underdeveloped fuzz growing, desperately trying to be "big boys" and able to help the family financially. That's a result that's probably worthwhile. The few that grow quickly compared to the rest, or are darker, can be snipped off as noticed, like wild eyebrow hairs are.    Notice though, that the removal did NOT change the hair itself. It just took advantage of the hair's current stage of development. In a couple years, there won't be that to take advantage of anymore. Discontinue the practice then, as it is work and doesn't give results. But do not think you in any way made that happen! You just took advantage of something rather than lose that opportunity. It's like thinning up by growing up: all those kids who were pudgy before summer and are thin and hot after school starts again. They simply grew and stretched the weight over the extra inches. They can take advantage of that effect by altering their diets and exercise levels so as to not pudge up again at their new heights, or they can let the chance go, pudge up again and have to work hard to undo that someday (if ever). A golden opportunity provided by the body to gain from a transitory effect, seized or lost depending on the person.    To affect your hair, you have to kill the hair follicle. Doctors can remove them completely (I truly don't know why hair transplant doctors don't offer that contrasting service). Lasers and electrical devices can burn them to death. You can burn the whole area of skin in, say, a house fire. (Don't. You'll look... odd... and where would you live then?)    Anything short of destroying the hair follicle leaves you with a hair that will grow right back out. Waxing tears the hair out of the follicle so the stubble you eventually get is a whole new hair, usually, with a tapered tip, and so on, feeling finer and bending more easily. So it looks better after the hair comes out than shaving does. Takes longer for stubble to appear too. But lacking an opportune development time like the peach fuzz stage, no, neither it nor shaving will have hair growing back lighter and less noticeable.    Good luck! Take advantage of what your body development offers at any stage and always research the scientific truth about how it works before listening to commercials and friends gush about how good something is. Oh, (if you're a girl) if you want to wax at a sleepover, do it. For the social fun, not for whatever the lead girl suggesting it says it will do. Remember that when a product can't explain how it works in terms of the scientific knowledge of how the body works, they're lying, trying to fill you with good-sounding guff. Like waxing. If they said what you ask, but can't explain how mechanically ripping a hair out of the follicle can somehow affect how the DNA in the follicle cells works to produce something new after a simple mechanical tearing, then they are lying. Easy as pie!
BWmSvTZ0aa	I like it, a lot. The whole thing. Although my mom is reading over my shoulder and going, "That boy should not get his OWN name tattooed on him," and going 'tsk-tsk' lmao|`|LaQ8Ejt3aa	sounds stupid to me|`|xuV1xsImaa	DONT get anyones name tattooed on you! But the hand apple idea sounds really cool, it would look best really graphic and stylized.|`|1TKfwDGsaa	It sounds interesting, but the apple part with his name makes it sound like he's partly responsible for the mankind's sinful nature, in which case I'm going to have to have some words with him. ;-)
LCfFjJvJaa	what you should do is go buy a thin headbead, at a hair store or something and then but your hair in the highest ponytail that it can go, and use the thin headband to pull back the remaining hair, odds are, you might be the only one wearing your hair like that, or you can use the headband, and make a poof with the thin headband still using the ponytail.|`|cweT8Phpaa	Hi, how long is your hair?

AA11404742	No, that's an old wive's tale.  There's no truth to it.      It probably came about because when the hair does grow back, it hasn't been bleached out by the sun yet, so it's darker, and it looks thicker than the ones around it.  But if you let it fade, it will be the same as the others afterward.

ss48BEk5aa	Most of the time an infection is not a tattoo shops fault. She was probably exposed to more germs this time around for some reason.. happened to me.   A sea salt soak is the absolute best thing for it. Take a few teaspoons of non-iodized sea salt and dissolve it in boiling water. Then dip a clean, lint-free towel in the solution and wring out the excess. Apply it to the wound, re-dipping once the towel becomes cold or room temperature. Do this for 20-30 minutes twice a day. Did wonders for me!   Unfortunately, if the infection is bad, most of the ink will ooze out and she will have to get it re-done in a few months.  Hope this helps!|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	There is no way to proove the infection came as a result of anything from the tattoo shop. The fact is most all of the time if a tattoo or piercing becomes infected its of fault of improper care on the person who got the tattoos part. Tattoo shops can only be held liable for infections of HEP A , B , C.   It is the persons responsibility to take care of the tattoo it is an open wound. Like any open wound infections can come from air bourne germs, it can become infected after not being washed and cleaned, ect. This is in no way liability of anyone but the tattooed person.|`|5Kr2szSsaa	if the invection came from within her skin you know the healing process didnt go so great well obs there's nothing you can do.    you'll know if the infection was caused by dirt getting into it from outside because it will have white spots on it.    you wont be able to tell if its the shop, and if this is her 10th tattoo done at the same shop i doubt it is the shop if all others have healed well!    my foot tattoo got very badly infected and the top of my foot was close to being cut away and that wasnt because of anything i'd done or the tattooist it was infection thatt just developed!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	feet tats heal really slowly.  esp if you walk a lot...dirt gets on easier.  it probably wasn't the shop, just the area getting dirty.  keep it elevated and wash it at least 3 times a day.  they have topless flip flops...(believe it or not)  www.topless-sandel.com .  I recommend for everyone getting a foot tat.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Take care of it and don't let it get infected again.  Tell her to keep it completely uncovered for two weeks and wash it three times a day with antibacterial soap.|`|9cBLKOe8aa	If she was wearing a shoe or keeping it covered that may be why it got infected and might not have anything to do with shop. It is on her foot after all.     Just keep it clean, with antibacterial non-scented soap. Keep it uncovered and keep the dry spots moisturized.

ry42ObN7aa	Take multivitamins. Wash your hair every other day, or every two days. Keep it cleaned and conditioned. Don't put harsh chemicals on it. You can also put very very light oils in it, but not to the point to where it is oily or greasy (gross). This is what I do. I thought that I was going bald, but really I wasn't taking good care of my hair. Now it is full and thick (a little too thick now, but I'm not bald ha ha.) Oh and the oil that I used was this stuff called HollyWood Beauty Olive Creme Oil. It is very light and non-greasy. Another one that I used was Softee Indian Hemp Oil, it's a hair and scalp treatment. Just a dab of this is all that you need! Too much of this can make your hair oily like whoa! Basically what these products do is make your scalp healthy so that your hair can grow more and be healthy. Trust me, your hair will grow more if used properly. And yes this can be used for all ethnicity's. It's just not for a particular race. Duhh I have used it. Any way go buy it, try it, and see if these products work for you. Oh! The multivitamins help your hair grow to! Your hair needs so many vitamins and minerals to keep it growing and healthy. I hope that I helped. And make sure that you comb or brush it gently.  Hardcore brushing or combing can make it come out to. Yuppers...|`|wKQrjuGSaa	oh that sucks|`|b25a74469233f38d4ab50bb09a3c6f0caa	oh sweetheart, sad to say look at your parents, it might be in your genes, however might just be natural hair shed, but if u are balding u wont get away fast, try a bald look.|`|AA10192395	That happens to me sometimes, usually stress is what causes it.

I considered getting this after my mother died because I wanted something to remind me that she is still here, just not physically, but I ended up having a completely different tattoo for her. But this is the ankh - http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=ankh... - as you can see it's a simple design which can be open to a lot of interpretation.    Altenatively, if you were looking for something a bit more substantial, a phoenix is another obvious and great choice. Obviously a symbol for rebirth and new life, and is great to get for a lost loved one if you believe that their spirit has lived on and experienced a new beginning. And as a bonus, they are beautiful, totally open to interpretation as of course it's a mythological being, and make some wonderful tattoos.

lU8e0VQFaa	For some people it helps but not for everyone, still, it's a good idea in general to eat healthy. I would say give it some more time and see what happens, 2 weeks is hardly anything.|`|DUOoMBqoaa	I think acne takes 6 weeks to manifest sometimes, thats what a dermo told me. Changing one or two things may not make a difference if the rest of your diet isn't balanced. I know sugar makes mine worse, but not eating enough can disrupt your metabolism and cause problems too. Drinking lots of water is definitely a good thing. Check if you are eating excess oils or sweeteners,(HF corn syrup is in ALOT of processed foods). I find eating apples, fish, and veggies keeps my skin pretty clear.|`|zU8WEjoZaa	Diet is part of keeping a good complexion, but what you use on your face is also a major factor. What kind of face wash are you using? If I were you, I would get a natural cleanser and moisturizer for a company like Burts Bees, Aveeno, or Kiss My Face. They work great even on sensitive skin.    As for what you're eating, keep it up! It may take another week or so, but gradually, there will be a difference. Never mind the fact that it is just really healthy, and will help you live longer too. Another thing you could add to your routine is 30 mins of exercise a day. Even if you don't have time, do a small exercise whenever you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk everywhere you can, etc.     By doing these things, you will not only  be a healthier person, but you will see a difference in your skin, just give it a little more time. Be Patient!    Good luck, and I hope this helps!|`|254828ecc65b9d1e8d463a80169f3286aa	i know it should be obvious to me but are you drinkin around 8 litres a day? i notice the difference then.. ill admit i dnt have enough fluids myself, it could also be down to the products youre using, you might need to throw away your face cream if youve had it for a while, try one from the simple range as it has no perfumes etc|`|kH3IaPPIaa	ive noticed a real difference in my skin now that i have cut out junk food. i eat lots of kiwi and a range of veg and although it didnt happen overnight, it is worth doing. hard though because i love chips, cakes and sweets!|`|hPuS6cxAaa	Fuit and veg is good, water is good.

Cut out dairy that will make a big difference.|`|OKq5VOkqaa	The honest truth...    I have suffered with acne for so long. I have tried everything. But did notice last month that I began eating healthy.... the following  1. raw spinach salads  2. chicken breast  3. lots of water  4. salmon  5. nuts  6. no sweets  7. no greasy foods.  8. omega 3 fish oil pills    pretty much these are some healthy foods I consumed and things that I did not and I realized that my face was clearing up a whole lot. No new crops and such. My skin looked naturally radiant and cleared. also I did not neglect to exercise, wash my face twice a day with an acne cleanser and used Mary Kay acne gel. You don't have to use the mary kay ( use whatever u have if is effective for u) but a good diet does make a big difference.Give it time but it should not take that long. Don't cheat because even a little bit of unhealthy food can go a long way.

So if your interested in this at all just e-mail me and i can help you out. its real easy trust me!|`|utWwwIpkaa	This might sound strange, but Milk of Magnesia is really effective for absorbing oil. Use it as a face mask and wash off. Or put on a light layer under your make-up.   I have found over the counter products very ineffective, but the Milk of Magnesia works well. You can buy it at Pharmacy's  Never use any face products that contain alcohol.It makes your skin produce more oil.|`|bd3jQ1lgaa	cover girl pressed powder! i have the same problem and it helps! and it works!!!!!!
lU8e0VQFaa	Yes, it will, unlike with an enlargement they need to cut open the actual breast to remove the tissue and do a lift so that you're not left with saggy boobs. A good surgeon should be able to minimize scaring but there still will be some.|`|Mumfvpuzaa	yes, it will leave scars but they will fade.  i had a breast reduction in october and my scars are healing very nicely.  my friend had the same surgery by the same doctor about a year ago and hers are barely visable.  my doctor told me to put medical paper tape over the scar lines to keep them flat and thin.  so far it's working wonderfully.
wtQY6VEwaa	Why not try to find a few picture that are influential to you, then bring it to the artist for them to make their own interpretation. Things like the flag raising at iwo jima are classics.     Why not look into something like medal of honor recipents, or people that you look up to, too? Include pictures of your grandfathers as well. I'm sure if you come with enough material, the artist could come up with a good mural.|`|kCdISEGqaa	If I were doing the tattoo for you, I would maybe think of doing silhouettes of soldiers in a progressive nature, from early on, as far back as you wished, and place era specific helmets on their heads and maybe a very faint blowing flag in the background.  I would go as far back as the civil civil war, their headgear was more identifiable as military, make it smaller and the size of the silhouettes get larger, the largest being the most recent headgear of today, while you're serving.  Lots of ideas, you could also do era specific firearms standing in dirt, crossed against each other making a "fence" like image around your arm.  In the background, it could be a battlefield scene.  Ask your artist for suggestions, there are so many things you could do with it.  Have fun and good luck!!!|`|HtRLnntRaa	In the UK we have the red poppy to symbolise blood shed and the white poppy to symbolise peace (remembrance day 11/11)    Does the US not have something like that, thats well known
A4GeVvUeaa	Blow dry your hair straight with a round brush after you take a shower.|`|yzROqTyoaa	hmm.  well i think it really depends on the type of hair you have..    with curly hair..like major to the scalp ringlets;  -it always helps to get your hair cut in layers.  - when you straighten it, put it up in like buns or clips, and work from the underneath to the outside, so it's thoroughly straightened.  -always use a form of like..protection. they make a lot of styling products for really curly hair when you are straightening it, to make it faster, easier, and so it doesn't damage your hair from straightening it on a daily basis.    for like wavy/ curly hair;  -same basic things  - if it;s thick or medium, i'd get layers. anyone can pull them off.  - if it's pretty thin, i would just get the products, or get it professionally starightened so it lasts a while and you don't have to do it.    for hair with just curled ends;  -it shouldn't take that long,  maybe look at getting the tips featherd or tapered,  same things as the other two.      wet-to-striaght flat irons always work better, but that's just me.  and another thing,  if you ever get one of them;  NEVER STRAIGHTEN IT WHEN IT'S WET.  i know that's what they are made for,  but they make it major frizzy.  and it helps if you blow dry your hair and straighten it directly after.  it makes it a lot more work if you go to bed with it wet.    hope any of this helps :)|`|uJB3Yet6aa	seperate your hair into little sections  leave a little bit down on the bottom  straighten it  drop another small layer down   straighten that piece,  repeat till youve done all of you hair  and maybe it is your flatiron that makes it take so long  get a higher powered one  try a spray or other product that will make it easier  one called osis is good|`|0YNTyAsoaa	it takes me awhile to do my hair as well,but not 2 hours probably 30-45 minutes.but a good way to minimize the time is by getting hair clips and sectioning your hair by layers..do the bottom,the middle,and than work your way to the top,it really will minimize the time trust me:)|`|2cheAoRqaa	my friend would always do half before she went to bed and the other half in the morning cause her hair was long and thick mine is really thin so it takes me likehalf an hour but i would suggest doing at night then in the morning it cuts down alot of the time|`|NGHajxLKaa	lol. i feel ya. I'm mixed and my thick, frizzy, curly hair take my about the same time to straighten. Sectioning it will help a lot
Qjiwyx5Uaa	I've had this happen to me before.  If it's an ingrown hair it will be a little black bump...I pinched it until it started getting red and then pulled the hair out with tweezers. It's a little painful, but it works.  You have to basically squeeze the hair follicle out a little bit then just pick at the skin with the tweezers and pull at it for a bit until the hair surfaces, then remove it with the tweezers.
WLuEIwp5aa	Where do you people go that charges less than $100 an hour and what quality of work are we talking about?  Cheapest place I've ever been in was $125 an hour, and that was only how much the youngest guy who had just finished his apprenticeship charged, everybody else was $150 or $175.    Anyway, if I went to my usual shop and got that done, I would think it would take something like 4-5 hours, maybe 6 and cost anywhere from $600-900, and don't forget to tip!  I would be sure to have about $1200 saved up.|`|wuRmrrfyaa	First of all, find a good ink house. Don't go to one just because they give you the cheapest price. If you find one you like, browse the website, look at the galllery of previous tat's, and customer feedback. If it seems like the one for you, then go in, and have a chat with one of the artists. They'll be able to give you a much more definate pricing range and time scale.     From just looking at it, it looks like a good three ish hours for the outline alone, with possibly one + for the shading and colouring. Maybe two to three sessions. And it's going to cost quite alot. I'd guesstimate about 200-400, min to max.     But if you want it, price and time will be no issue. I just went through four hours of torture on my lower abdomen/waist.....and a silly amount of birthday money.....but i have a beautiful tattoo that will last me a lifetime and beyond. In the end, it's all about what YOU want. Don't let others change your mind.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	that is a nice one. i would think 2 sessions and 600.00 later it will be yours.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	like someone else said, you are looking at approximately 2 sessions. maybe total $750-800. If you want it about that size.     Make sure you get good references of where you go. Dont go to a place that is cheap, you will regret it.  I know I did!!!     Really look into the place you get it done.|`|OuQizrQ6aa	The tattoo might cost you a couple hundred bucks, but you have to factor in the opportunity costs when no one wants to hire you because you've decorated your body to look like a criminal. Then, it will cost you thousands of dollars to get removed when you finally come to your senses. Save your money. A classic, clean-cut look never goes out of style.     Unless you're aiming no higher than a career in the food service industry. In which case, mad props on the wicked tat, brah.|`|OujhXy2yaa	I have four tattoos and have NEVER been turned down for a job I've applied for, if it's on your arm you can just wear long sleeves anyway...  typical pricing for a decent tattoo artist is $60/hr, more if you have a well known one.  I would guess at about 2 sessions of 2-3 hours each for something like that.  so you're looking at $240-$360 if you use a reputable artist.  I would not reccomend going anywhere with a lower price than that since they usually have bad reputations for a reason.  ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE TATTOO PARLOR IS STERILE
EnSqcHjlaa	It would be cuter if you cut off the long hair in the front. But without cutting it, would look ok. it doesn't look the best but mabey if you had a slim face it would look Good. It could also look good with ruffle clothing with some tight jeans! :) 4-7 probaly|`|CNotcjbaaa	Not very cute in my opinion, for me, but you.    It's all your decision. It looks best with longish bony faces, I suppose.|`|zYdi5UeIaa	2 is th best all the others look like she just got out of bed and cut her hair off bey its solve|`|7FMzLAdBaa	i think its...ok      it would look best with a slim face...probably heart shaped|`|0kLqVi2Daa	idk why but i hate it
e8raYCzIaa	hmm how about you backcomb your bang area a little bit so its like a bump. then say small pieces of hair and bobby pin them to the back of your head then curl them|`|AA11669383	me too my best thing is putting my hair in a pony tail but i go to the salon so just go there i go every friday to make sure i look good
P2VFQyZSaa	it depends on what kind of pageant it is.  all pageants are different. but i get my dresses from    tiza.com    also. if it is a serious pageant. get a pageant coach! trust me, you dont want to be the girl with no experience and no idea.    you need to work on poise, eye contact, smile, walk, gracefullness, posture, speaking ability, and your talent (i hope you have one!)    and at my last pagent they asked me:  what do you think the biggest problem in our schools are today?  what kind of leadership and community help to do contribute to your community? (by the way, helps if you have community service)  and : how would you help a younger girl who is having doubts about how she looks?    hoped i helped. good luck. if you dont get a coach i guess watch as many pageants as you can and copy. research. do anything possible.  =)|`|v9KkatxAaa	You should check out this website:  http://www.puddlescollection.com  The "Tracy" and the "Eileen" dresses are great for pageants.  The "Kate" is great for interviews.  Good luck!
5OkElbAVaa	take biotin. it's basically a health supplement like a vitamin.  it worked really well for me;  my hair became stronger and was less prone to breaking and split ends. eventually it helped my hair grow as well. you can get it at gnc. or just look for any health supplements that help your hair, nails, and skin. just ask someone at gnc.    and don't straighten your hair. try scrunching it or wearing it up for a while.|`|1y1c5QWHaa	I know two products that are awesome for fixing your hair:  Aussie 3-Minute Miracle  Garnier Fructis Hair Mask.  They both work great!  Also, while you have conditioner in your hair, brush it thoroughly. Really helps to get rid of the tangles and frizziness.  Suave is a cheap shampoo... I tried it for a while, totally made my hair a mess.  Sunsilk Hairapy has really awesome shampoos and conditioners! Plus, they have a special shampoo conditioner combo for straight hair; another for volume; and a different just for repairing damaged hair, but this one comes with 24/7 creme.  The other Aussie and Garnier Fructis products are good also, I just  prefer the 3-Minute Miracle and the Hair Mask.  One more thing: DON'T BLOW DRY YOUR HAIR!!! Even though it dries your hair in less than five minutes, it totally makes it super frizzy! Plus, it wastes energy.    I really do hope this helps you with your frizzy hair!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I use the shampoo and conditoner from Pantene  It works really well on me  =]
uGIIR9Beaa	Wear what is most comfortable for you. If you're afraid dressing up too sexy is going to get you negative attention, then listen to your feelings: wear something which is a bit more covering then what you normally wear to a club. If that is a nice top and a long skirt, then perfect! If it is a small top and a short skirt, perfect too. Wear what YOU feel is comfortable. :)|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	dont wear what I wore, unless you want the attention.     I went for my 18th Bday to a strip club with my Best Friend (a male) and I went in a little pink ruffled mini skirt a black tube top and stiletto heels. I looked great, but one guy thought I was a stripper there and wanted to know how much for a lap dance! I was embarrassed but because of what I was wearing I was getting much attention from all the strippers and I actually met some really nice girls there since I was dressed to impress them. lol. Dress comfortable. Jeans look tacky, really. so either a skirt and a skimpy top, or some nice tight pants and a revealing top, so you dont look stuck up.. they wont come near your group..they'll think you're not comfortable there.|`|AOkucu5haa	What you'd wear to a regular club,I guess.|`|NGKwsawdaa	same thing that you would wear  at a night club|`|45le25Kgaa	A pearl necklace|`|5wFZv27Xaa	dont wearr clothes, its tacky!|`|AACwATn5aa	You just wear what you'd normally wear to a club.  You'll be surprised how many girls go and just dress normal.  I've been a few times (no I'm not into girls) just went with my friends for whatever reason.  The first time I felt the same but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  We didn't sit on perv roll or anything but everyone was just dressed normal.
aJnyY9ynaa	I LOVE it.   That's just the way it smells, don't throw it away.  After awhile you'll get use to it.|`|B7JOPpg0aa	Yes it is supposed to smell like a rosy smell, my mom use to have it, and it worked okay, has good volume and everything. I think you should just keep it cuz if it really works for you, just keep on using it and you will get use to the smell. I got used to mine.|`|IUOVfZc6aa	It Does smell weird! It is a fairly nice mascara though! If you thinking about changing, def go with the XXL Mascara!  I have other tips about my makeup faves also if you want to check it out!  http://lovealwaysck.blogspot.com/|`|RyIFqmVEaa	i dnt use those cheap mascaras anywho, yea my friend uses it and it smells terrible|`|5OORL0IWaa	Hell yea it SMELLS NASTY! It works wonders though for us who can afford 30 Dollar Mascara. Well I just Smell good everywhere else I realized the smell Is really only there when you put it on when its wet. After it drys you can't really smell it anymore.

hot7YiVWaa	They're short, it draws more attention to your penis and your butt. I think there is a less chance of girls being attracted to you than being embarrassed of you. I think we all agree you should get a different pair of swim wear. Adults and especially parents will be surprised to see a 14 year old dressed like this to a public place.|`|igrdohopaa	Are you serious? HAHAHA nah kid|`|FJIgKzzKaa	unless your gay... i dont think that you shouold be wearing that  actually i dont think anyone should be wearing that    i am scarred|`|gFRDHjHeaa	oh no honey you should nott wear that!!! nonononono!!!|`|8MVrUtbAaa	Very niceee!! haha.  xoxo|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Cuz it looks gay?|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I like them.  Some people are always going to make fun of something.  All that matters is you like them and want to wear them.  Don't let what other people think determine what you do.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well I kind of would be to, well maybe not. But maybe others won't because they may not be use to seeing anything like that or there may be kids there. :)|`|jLm0P6f2aa	i dont think these truks are meant to be worn by a 14 year old, wear board shorts or something .|`|FPZvSRkMaa	i bet they look good...lmao    i'm also 14...lol|`|KMy4b77naa	it's probably not the low rise, but the cut and pattern. i would suggest buying a longer pair, maybe in a more neutral, solid color like black or gray. if you want patterns, get something less intense like plaid or skulls.|`|9JCmbQOhaa	rofl sorry  it just made me laugh seeing that picture  in other countries, warmer countries maybe, this style might be more of the norm  in America, most guys don't go around parading their package like that except in swim tournaments  But hey if you have the confidence to expose yourself like that way to go you!|`|9JzsDSB1aa	because other people are narrow minded and probably think it make you look gay.    me personally they are plain ugly. whether a gay straight old or young those trunks r ugly to me

And I know you said not to, but I hope you understand how immature you sound saying you're not young, you're 13 1/2. It reminds me of when I argued I should ride a bike because I was 5 3/4. 13 is barely even past a tween. And I know you said not to comment on your makeup either, but the eyeliner on the bottom really just makes your eyes look small and weird. No offense by any of this. You're a cute little girl.|`|x57o6wOoaa	Yuour hair looks okay....but in my opinion it would look better if it where straight! hope i helped|`|bvTJ4tnOaa	It looks bad.|`|oND37Cflaa	it looks more wavy but its ok you could try rollers or before you sleep twist a strand of hair,then twist it into a circle shape and pin it to your head repeat and then wakeup and undo and you will have curls (do this like over the weekend to test it becuase it might get super curly and look like poof ball if you do it too tight but you can wash it out)    like this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50yw2W5F_...|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Since you have really short hair and it's layered it could be hard to curl your hair. I suggest going for a straight/wavy look or try to curl all the layers of your hair if you really want volume and curls.     By the way, 13 1/2 is still pretty young :)|`|BtK9nSalaa	yeah i dont want to be rude, but try wearing it straight instead of curly

Actually I used to lotion in the morning and then in the evening after I shaved until it was so bad, then I just started doing it only after I shaved and it should be fine.

6eaWRGaqaa	Not really. I have like a favorite hoodie, a favorite tank, favorite sweats, and favorite jeans but it's not like part of an outfit. Usually after I buy something new I wear it for like a month straight (okay I have uniforms at school, so really just on the weekends). Then when I buy something new I never wear my old cloths. Haha I don't know why but one day I'll love my cloths and the next day I'll hate my cloths so favorite outfits don't really last that long. So basically I'll like have this favorite outfit for a month straight, then have a new favorite outfit. I really don't go shopping anymore because of school, but I used to like once a month. Now I just buy a few shirts and such for the different seasons, so I just usually wear my Field Hockey sweatshirt and these comfy sweats from a Bar Mitzvah.    Right now my favorite hoodie is white from Pink (by VS) and says "peace" on it. Then my tank is pink with like kisses all over it (idk they're just like really popular right now) or I have another favorite one that's just light blue and adorable. My favorite purse is this white Louis Vuitton one, my old favorite purse was the Gucci signature but I don't like the shape anymore (wow that sounded spoiled, but I'm really not..). Then my favorite sweats are my school sweats because they are SO comfy =] haha. yepp but yeaah that's like an example of my "favorite outfit".    -Catherine|`|OI29tkSoaa	Yes I absolutely do|`|PTK2x59Kaa	yes, i LOVE it for school and a lot of times i'll be alsmost finisshed getting ready then relize i wore it like 2 days befor :(.|`|pOKdvur0aa	Yes.

5ZK9VGPCaa	On first glance I'm not so sure about the colour, but with the rest of the items you said you will wear it with, I think it will look good.. and I think the reservations I have about the colour stem from the fact that green doesn't suit me personally, so I am always hesitant about anything green. But if green suits you, then I'm sure it will look very good. Ignore the person who said it will look "too" preppy, because there's no such thing for guys!     Will you answer my question too (not about lipstick this time :)  ... )?  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	That's kind of really hott!|`|olzXIiSKaa	125$, for a cardigan, :S. its really ugly btw|`|5ee23ceaa5a48c6b8dcca12a44359952aa	whatever floats your boat  but me personally i wouldn't like that on a guy|`|dWeHChwwaa	now THATS what i call an outfit. very sleek and sexy!|`|2Zm03QGIaa	hahaha no.  way too preppy-looking.
LVy1YMswaa	Proclaim olive oil foam wrap is a good one. it is a foam and you can get it from sallys. it doesn't leave your hair crunchy|`|Zcx9JOGXaa	try lotta body.it come in a liquid form or foam form. try see if you can buy it here. http://www.savebeauty.com|`|SR5zlAl8aa	idk u top contributer
lkNJNnlSaa	you can't really do much, spots are natural.    I guess alot of foundation|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	Pat some toothpaste on it several times a day. Or use rubbing alcohol on it, 5 times a day.|`|zDf186Xyaa	use a needle|`|AcsML4Leaa	over the next to days just keep cleansing your face ALOT, and dont clog your pores with makeup, keep your face fresh for a couple of days.  good look with the date (:|`|dzaX1o7Daa	Use face soap and sugar and mix into a paste and sleep with it on overnight or leave it as long as you can without touching it. it usually helps bring spots out and use savalon or any cut or wound healing Cream o it down to get rid of redness and infection if you pop it but only if it has came out but usually it takes a couple of days.|`|NkKfvuqNaa	Wash your face with soup and water a lot and use a face mask, then if that doesn't work use consealer|`|10cnKUpxaa	Just think to yourself, what would Chuck Norris say? The true answer then becomes clear....|`|QgKAL3sEaa	Put toothpaste on it over night... dries it out. Don't over wash your face, that's not good for your skin.    Green concealer is good (under foundation!) for reducing redness... if not, normal concealer/foundation works cool.    Good luck on your daaate!|`|NDJORGHeaa	http://www.beautyparlor.co.uk buy the Benefit Boo Boo Zap spot treatment. Will both remove and prevent spots.|`|dd7MZ0BGaa	This may sound a bit silly... but i use toothpaste.   If i can feel a lump forming under my skin and i know its going to be a spot, i rub toothpaste over it before i go to bed. leave it on overnight and then wash it off in the morning.   It works well for me, i hope ot does for you too.
sUGV8X29aa	OMG. SO CUTE!! That's a really good choice. it matches your face and everything. You should totally get it!! but only if you want to. if you don't wanna then that's okay too cuz your really pretty. im a bit jealous. ;]   But yeah if you want to get it, i totally encourage you to do so. =]|`|CZwJJetyaa	I would go for something much edgier.|`|e7uePiyZaa	keep it curly|`|nF3AbLBWaa	that would look really cute on you, but you would have to straighten your hair everyday, which is a pain, but you'll soon get over it.  Just by a really good straightener. Like at least a 30 dollar one, I got one from Claire's for 10 dollars and it doesn't even get hot, so get a good one especially since you have super curly hair.|`|IWGSD34Oaa	the haircut is kinda momish  but your really pretty so i think  you can definately pull it off  :]|`|Gf8Hi4Pbaa	I don't think the layered shag look is a good idea if you have naturally curly hair, maybe a more subtle look. I love your hair color btw
7mmmGytpaa	go to the store with your receipt and exchange it, it doesn't matter that you got it online unless it was on sale  or put it in the wash with the hottest water possible|`|uRA81RXkaa	you can return it, in the store|`|EGvBUet0aa	why would you buy a medium if your an xs???|`|LLQLjlEpaa	put it in the wash and dry it
zhzJoZ26aa	I think as long as you don't look like a hooker, you can wear as much as you want. I wear A LOT of makeup for a 16 year old, but I make it look natural. There are so many people who can wear like 3 or 4 things, and it looks really cakey, and bad. Personally I do my drag queen look (I know you know what I mean, really  over the top bam makeup) when I'm going out with some friends, or a really important event.<br>  <br>  I also love makeup as an art, I look at it that way. The reason I get up in the morning is to paint. Paint my face beautiful. <br>  <br>  <br>  This is what I use everyday:<br>  Face makeup:<br>  -Oxy daily moisturizer<br>  -Mac prep n prime<br>  -MAC Studio fix fluid foundation NC20<br>  -MAC Studio finish concealer NW25 undereye circles<br>  -Blush my new favourite is MAC hello kitty blush in tippy. I've been using it everyday since I got my package early morning on the 14th<br>  -Bronzer to contour my cheeck bones and neck, I use nars laguna. I've been using this for about 6 months it's the only one that isn't THAT orange on my skin. Every other bronzer I've used is orange to the max. Because I have a weird skin tone, it has pinky, yet goldy-yellow undertones<br>  <br>  Eye makeup:<br>  -MAC paintpot my everyday one is painterly, but if I'm doing a dramatic look i'll used a coloured one (blackground is a favourite for night).<br>  -Daily shadows: MAC: Ploof!, naked lunch, sable and carbon<br>  naked lunch or ploof! on my whole lid and brow bone. sable in the crease, carbon for depth. <br>  -I switch up my mascaras but my current favourite is maybeline full n soft in brownish black<br>  -once or twice a week I'll wear ardelle #117 falsies.<br>  -L'oreal liquid liner on upper lashline or mac dipdown fluid line<br>  I don't like blacktrack from mac it's not as intense black as the l'oreal one.<br>  <br>  Lips:<br>  Lately I've been wearing a maybeline one i don't know what it's called but it's a berry red with MAC pink grapefruit lipglass over it. I also like myth and angel by MAC though under mouthwatering lipglass or love nector luster glass<br>  But the past week, everyday I've been wearing mac hk pink fish TLC.<br>  <br>  <br>  We're the same age, and we're both drag queens(my mom tells me I'm worse then a drag queen, so i've been calling myself a drag queen) so as long as it looks good, you're fine.|`|AA10669025	I think there might be a little too much makeup if you are asked what circus you are working with.  Ok, that is probably a little extreme!<br>  <br>  When the makeup is noticed more than the person.  Sometimes all you see is the makeup but not the beautiful person behind the makeup.  <br>  <br>  I am happy that you are comfortable with the way you look.  That is great!  A lot of people go through the trauma and drama of trying to live up to other people's unrealistic beauty standards.  That hurt and harm can stay with a person for years.<br>  <br>  I have added some websites for you to check out.<br>  <br>  Much Blessings to you on your life journey!|`|wLa4rKAFaa	When It looks like your finger would leave an imprint if you touch their face, thats too much makeup.<br>  <br>  - Unnaturally orange <br>  - Clumpy eyelashes<br>  - Blush that has't been blended.<br>  <br>  Bascially, less is more.|`|QeInCI4Raa	When you can tell someones foundation is darker then their skin!<br>  <br>  i hate that!!!!! I think eyes and blush and lip gloss is fine.|`|JkumHzjraa	I'm 14 years old and I personally love makeup as well but I don't wear a lot. Well, I don't think it's a lot. All I wear is a little bit of eyeliner on my waterline and sometimes mascara on my top lid. That's the only makeup I wear but a lot of makeup to me is putting on tons of foundation, eye shadow, eyeliner and other makeup. But you're still young so I wouldn't wear a lot. The only reason people need to wear makeup when they're older is because they start wearing it at a young age and they hide their damaged skin with it.|`|mHOvddIvaa	When it looks cakey and ridiculous. I wear a lot of different products but it looks fine because it isn't caked on.|`|e489ymwhaa	I LIKE THE NATURAL MAKEUP LOOK|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Heavy blush is probably what pushes me over the line. Blush should look natural, as should the rest of your face makeup. A played up eye is fine, if done tastefully. A played up lip is great too, but I think doing both at once is a bit much.<br>  <br>  But I'm one of those "it shouldn't look like you're wearing makeup" types. I only do it up when I go out, and even then I'm concerned that it's a bit much.|`|YCMUPkbZaa	its too much when your foundation is caked on or when your mascara looks like spider legs lol. Most girls at my school put on a ridiculous amount of blush and its not even blended. Haha silly girls.<br>  <br>  Ps drag queens are definitely the wrong inspiration.
EkCzXUM2aa	http://www.stylebell.com/HAI-Twig-Flat-I...      find a straightener like this   you will be able to get close to the roots  really even a 1 inch would be hard to use with male hair   that why this one is so narrow, much easier and better results|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	The CHI is really good.

It was used for thousands of years on wounds. Use it like they said, or you can add some cinnamon to it as well.    :)|`|JPpDWrDUaa	yes, this works. Actually you'll be surprised how food really works well with acne.|`|K36jovxfaa	yes honey works|`|wdnbwViFaa	yes! it works really well i do honey masks. honey is fabulous :)  good luck|`|fMPyLqW4aa	It does work! I do it alot. Put a dab on and leave it on for awhile then wash it off with warm water. Toothpaste works good, too.
FJzHWG0faa	well depending on how long they are...     if they reach at least your eyebrows, use a hair straightener, dividing them into 3 sections- middle and the 2 sides. Do each section separately, angling it under to keep all little hairs from sticking out. after you're done with each, touch them up by blending the sections together with the straightener.    If they're not long enough you can try it but it really should take too long for them to grow the appropriate length for the above style : ) Good Luck!!|`|hQNHzc6faa	Try swepting them to the side for a choppy side bang look. If that doesn't work, just clip them out of the way and wait for it to grow longer for a long fringe.|`|6wIfS0b9aa	can u like get a clip and tie them back?  thats what some of my friends do.|`|NBLmYWRBaa	you can twist and pin to the side in a variety of ways. its really in right now. you just need some bobbie pins and creativity.|`|HgNd8LUzaa	You can gather the bangs together and get a clip or bobby pin and just pin it back. And if that doesn't work, you can get a headband.
oXKLf3hMaa	put a ruler/pencil/straight object against the outside corner of your nostril. the inside tip of your eyebrow should be in the same line as this part of your nose and the inner corner of your eye.    the arch should be on the line of that part of your nose to the middle of your lower eyelid.    the brow should end on the line from that part of your nose to the outer corner of your eye.    eyebrows should be thickest towards the middle of your face and get progressively thinner as you move out.
NSKimt1Qaa	I use Burt's Bees lip balm and skin care products.  I like them a lot.  I was looking for something natural to use and that's how I got started using them.

Plus you'll probably find a one of a kind.|`|mPS2Zccaaa	Nine West has a really good selection of leather handbags. I just got my mom one for about $25, but I went to Ross. Are there any where you live? Check them out online, their purse sections is usually full of leather ones.
KL20mZUaaa	If you want something neutral and basic, go for pricey. It's a GREAT investement, and all things "leathery" under 50 bucks are fake and plasticy. It'll look cheap so good for quality.|`|BUzrs76Baa	http://www.guess.ca/ProductDetails.aspx?...  http://www.guess.ca/ProductDetails.aspx?...    not sure where to get it for cheap, but this looks almost   exactly the same.|`|AA10027693	i was actually just out shopping today and found this adorable handbag. i'm 18 so i know you're what trying to say with mature but in a budget. this one is from Kohl's. the other thing bad about it is it sort of looks like a coach wannabe. but otherwise its EXTREMELY cute

And it's pretty trashy to have your bra blatantly hanging out. Go for a skin-colored strapless bra, you won't regret it.|`|CgdP9Hpdaa	i would pick a different top like a neutral color then have a bright bra.|`|aIj5W3lBaa	Girl that is not only ugly but trashy. You can look sexy and attractive.

dIFqzRmyaa	It depends on what type of hair you have. If you already have  curly hair you shouldn't get a Perm, if no you would look like you've been through a tornado. If you have died your hair more then once recently, then maybe you should wait a while before doing it again, or you can never die your hair again, if you do your hair color will look maybe green or red, maybe both. Maybe you should get both a Perm and die your  hair brown|`|FnQWXyp8aa	get a "perm" only dont get curls, get pretty waves, and then dye your hair brown :)|`|SR5zlAl8aa	DONT|`|7bANUeW6aa	please dont get a perm|`|EnYLhQajaa	Perm.  You'll look awesome!|`|FlKrA3nEaa	when you get a perm your hair will get a little lighter..so if your hair is dark youll get brown lol|`|sizRMfkAaa	no perm,  I would  dye it brown. Perming can be very damaging to hair.|`|VK3kyzGDaa	I don't really know because I don't know what color your hair is now.     But I LOVE curly hair!!!!!    I think PERM!    And if your hair is blonde or black. WHen you dye it brown..... later you will get a BAD growout!
26lZZaWNaa	I;m not sure you'll find any under $100, unless they're bootleg

ZOOjdv7Waa	i think you should leave your hair colour as it is. I don't know if it will fit you because you have a round face. and the other girl is pretty cute she has a nice smile.|`|wylAjpfmaa	noooo  i would seriously give anything for your hair!|`|9ni90gyVaa	none. why|`|IWGSD34Oaa	well you guys are young  but in the future you'll look better  and im just being honest   but maybe lose a couple pounds  and grow out you hair.  i absolutely love the texture of your hair!  :]]|`|vgXGNAuCaa	yeah|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	ok first if u were going to get the hairstyle you should def. dye ur hair a darker brown and then it will look good. if u want to make urself more prettier then you should wear foundation, eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, bronzer, and lip gloss. And i def. think you are wayyyyy prettier than that man.|`|lKZoOXpwaa	your pretty.  and yes that would look good on you.|`|07PoKaFOaa	I have that same style that you want.  I like your hair color so don't dye it, but that style would look great.  And I think you are wayy prettier than the other girl
BtiZd7OAaa	8.      I actually like the edited red hair :D I think it looks good.|`|wiJBiwmQaa	5 get some acne cream|`|hZlwaaP2aa	awe bbygirl you're cute!  but lay off the eyeshadow, and don't only wear really think eyeliner on the bottom, that looks cheesy, I know you're trying to pull off the whole "emo" look, but you'd be so much cuter without it.  Get some bangs. :D|`|Kjib1r07aa	You look really pretty in the second picture.   The other pictures are decent. I give you a 8 or 9|`|6lmFyr2maa	your cute but ditch the emo look... its not attractive, the first pics not that good either becuase your skin isnt very clear (i know your a teenager so that cant be helped)    based on the second pic id say 8/ 10    xxx|`|hF5599sXaa	beautiful, 10|`|7mmmGytpaa	4 1/2|`|ZOOjdv7Waa	7ish, but you're too young to be posting pictures of yourself on the internet.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	i'd give u about a 6, u r pretty, but here's somethings u can do, dye your hair, i don't know if that orangish color is dyed or what, but u should either dye your hair a darker shade of brown, or put some type of highlights in it, then get your eyebrows waxed, this makes a big difference, trust me! and don't put on that black eyeliner like that, if u must wear a little bit, go ahead, but just a little, and throw on some lip gloss, and u could be a 8 or 9!!|`|qQSbdcVYaa	6.5|`|zkWtHwccaa	7 or 8.    :/|`|A5Gwy3HGaa	I give you a 6 or 7|`|BkucBPwjaa	7 your pretty but the red hair....
zgWTRzyQaa	if you work your assets no one is gonna notice. people tend to think that everyone is looking at them when they look not so great. but in fact i bet no one will even notice. JLO booty? luckyyyy. you could have no booty like me. make your hair really pretty, paint up your eyes, stuff those tata's with little bean bags and toilet paper, COMFORTABLE parts, cute top, grren to match your eyes, and a cute jacket. there ya go. BOOM. sexy. :D|`|8noe8TWkaa	Buy some control-top underwear, and it will totally get rid of your muffin top! Throw in a push-up bra, and you're golden.
UHpqcG9Vaa	I don't use them, but I know about them. If you live in Los Angeles, the best place to get them is in a place called Hairroin Salon, they have 7 natural shades, and  can dye it to whatever color you want. and they are real human hair.
btPPw1FHaa	I was wondering the same thing as well, it's really annoying.|`|eWSPCM9Paa	there is a button on the side under the publish button that says zoom in.  if you click on that it should get bigger.  hope that helps :)|`|LtC9mphhaa	it always does that<br>  idk any way to change that other then maybe what the first person said but i've never tried that so i'm not sure

A long sleeved button up (worn unbuttoned though) over a white t shirt. :]<br>  And yeah, denim jackets over t shirts are nice!<br>  Hoodies and sweaters are a little too warm!

TIZc5nrSaa	You can never go wrong with polos, with an undershirt! And hoodies always look good withcargo pants, Denim jacket is pushing a little! Those havent really been in style for a while, and sweaters that are black, brown, or other neutral colors look great with jeans,  for a casual formal kind of look!|`|X05GAaLeaa	It depends on what the temp is , it is usually around 60 or 70 in ny state where i live (only in like mid april spring)<br>  so I wear shorts , short skirts , belly shirts , all of that|`|6lRygPWqaa	zip-up hoodie, cardi, flannel, all over the place really :]<br>  <br>  help<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoHBV4taLgKceHMY0.A8uhLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225150941AAdoGWP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Lp4JfVTRaa	I live in S.

gtAb94d2aa	Woah the two people wearing look almost exactly the same!    But yeah I definitely love the dress. Even though they're the same sort of design they can look so differently on both of the people with how the fit, which I think is awesome. It also looks like something you can change up a bit by how you chose to accessorize it.l    But mostly I just love it for the statement it makes. If you can get your hands on something like that, It wold be a great purchase. Go for it.    : )|`|ygm5zqS6aa	its really really cute =)|`|gYuF6QGZaa	You look old and your kinda large for that dress.

uR84UfBuaa	It's very moisturizing! What you do is you take one cup of mayo and put it into your dry hair, massage it through your scalp and leave it on for 15 minutes. After that just wash it out and voila, super soft hair.|`|cweT8Phpaa	Yes, my mom does, and it work to keep the hair smooth. My mother also uses Tea I think??? Put some mayo in a saucer and wash your hair as usual. (with mayo LoL) But mayo works. :)|`|cIROBuszaa	Don't do it.  Just don't. xD|`|ypyuMPYYaa	people use mayonaise on their hair usually before prom, homecoming, or some big event. It makes you hair soft and shiny. You take mayonaise and spread it through your hair, and spin it in a bun, then put your hair in a shower cap, and wait a while. then you take off the shower cap, and wash your hair.|`|aOxwt667aa	MAYO= X  USED MAYO ON YOUR HAIR= XD weird man...|`|mDt03eXIaa	It makes it soft and shiny, and it has protien so apparently it also strengthens your hair. Gloop it on there, comb it through and pull your hair up into a bun. Let it chill for a while and then wash it out. Olive oil works better though, and doesn't smell as bad.|`|ajS9NPI5aa	ewww dont do that... it will get into the follicles and youll smell like mayo. and nobody wants that..|`|QnSKaBcjaa	there are plenty of good hair masks out there. dont resort to mayo
AA11007043	girl now let me tell you that is EXACTLY what happend to my hair   now i have to perfect thing for you  just go to oudad.com this product saved me from all the fun people made of my poof but if you dont want to go through all the ordering and stuff you can just buy any curly hair product(that's not mousse, hair spray, or anything containing silicone),my prefered one is sunsilk captivating curls gel and cream twist,and just follow the styling instructions on the website youll love your curls in no time   oh and for shampoo and conditioner you can use neutrogena clean replenishing and moisturizing conditioner and shampoo(they're in pink bottles)  oh and avoid touching it and messing with it alot that causes frizz  it may take a bit of work but it will be worth it  good luck?
auSXXgVvaa	I have really frizzy hair too..but it only gets REALLY puffy when i blow dry it. ONe thing that has majorly helped my Frizziness is Frizz remedy. The only place i've been able to find it is walmart. But it works GREAT!  I'm not so sure what good shampoos and conditioners are..but I use some great products that make my hair soft and feel not so dry. they are Sebastian Taming Elixir. and Bed head after party. They help a ton!  i hope this helps you.(:    oh and I'll attach links of what what they all look like.|`|Mjyfwah7aa	herbal essences the none of your frizzieness or silky sexy hair|`|F6qNBAFVaa	if you have ethnic hair ( black hair) you should use aphogee products. i started using them and my hair looks and feels fabulous. use this hair regimin on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyUmztQEP... and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7joDaDZJ... i use all the products and it really works!|`|mPS2Zccaaa	I really like using Aussie shampoo and conditioner. I usually use the Aussie moist, Catch the Wave or Sydney Smooth. I can let my hair air dry, put a little of the Instant Freeze gel and my curls are awesome! I also use the leave in moisture conditioner. The products are a little pricey, but my hair will get out of control with crappy products. I also use John Frieda Frizz-Ease Hair Serum when I straighten my hair. It really tames my frizz and keeps my curls looking pretty.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	OIL!  What your hair needs is a good 'oil treatment' ... wash your hair but don't condition it, and towel dry it, then comb/brush it out, and pour/comb in as much PLAIN olive oil as you can until it starts to 'drip'.  Wrap your hair in your towel and sit in the HOTTEST place you can for an hour.  When you unwrap the towel, your hair should feel 'almost dry.'  Throw the towel into the wash, and wash, condition, and comb/brush your hair as usual, but let it 'air dry' (don't use a dryer of any kind).  Your hair should be less frizzy, and should feel softer and more supple.  If your hair is seriously damaged, you may give yourself another oil treatment a week later, then in two weeks, and again in four weeks.  Don't use a dryer on your hair, and comb or brush it 'flat' when you have towel dried it.  Another 'hint' is don't wash your head or hair with your fingertips ... use only the palms, and use no more than a 'dime sized' bit of shampoo, no more often than once a week.  If your hair is 'too damaged' you may want to consider getting the split ends cut off, but try at least two oil treatments first.  Does this work?  My hairdresser told me to use it on my own dry and damaged hair, and yes, it does work ... so do the other 'hints' about not using a dryer or scrubbing with my fingertips.  To get the best shampoo and conditioner for your hair, go to a GOOD hairdresser (I use an 'alternative salon' instead of the more 'old fashioned beauty salon) and ASK FOR HELP.  Even if you don't want anything else done, they should give you good advice.  People think that shampoo and conditioner from the salon are 'more expensive' but I've learned over time that one 10 ounce bottle of shampoo at $13 lasts me a full year, while I may use $25 or more of the 'grocery/pharmacy brands' ... so it actually costs 'less' ... and my hair looks GREAT, not just 'barely acceptable' ... and has since I 'switched' and got a good (I think he's GREAT) hairdresser to cut and perm my hair ... and I also got a good friend for life!|`|VP2fsPWzaa	in this article you will find a home remedy that worked for some of my friends :  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|eDRk230Uaa	you can use herble essence because it worked on me and believe me it works plzzz give 10 points|`|cjlWiqqCaa	http://www.johnfrieda.ca/en/20_54.asp     Try the john frieda frizz ease line of products It has everything from Shampoo to creams to serums|`|AA10047640	First let me say that if you use a blow-dryer to dry your hair after shampooing, stop and let it air dry, blow-dryers are the worst thing you can use on puffy, dry hair.     The best shampoos and conditioners I found for my hair are SUAVE hair products, they have them for all hair types and are far cheaper than other name brands. I hope this helps and good luck.

What I would suggest you do is get Hydrogen Peroxide or a bleaching creme and bleach your hair. It practically disappears after that - it is hardly noticeable. I have also used my Braun Hair removal epilator - see link. It works just like tweezing only faster. With of these options you will not risk your hair becoming thicker.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	use veet|`|dvY6UfiYaa	It wouldn't do any of that, but think of the pain!

YQJjh7Qpaa	The most you'll probably grow is 2 inches by may.  It grows about half an inch a month.  You dont have to get a trim but when you look at your hair and see some split ends, cut it off yourself.  Get a bottle of leave-in conditioner.  Put that on when your hair is stil most; not dripping wet.  There is this conditioner called mane N tail.  Its made for horses but people uses them too.  It's a reallie good conditioner.  it's about 5 bucks.  Eating healthy will get it to grow faster too.  Eating alot of protein and drinking alot of water.    Good luck.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	im a bit confused on your question could you clear it up a bit...|`|5j0NgLDmaa	There really isn't any way to make your hair grow faster. It all has to do with genetics. You can try massaging your scalp. This will increase the blood flow and stimulate growth.     As for styling your hair, try parting it a different way. Headbands and bows are always cute. Maybe try giving yourself side bangs. I tease my hair almost every day, no matter what I'm doing with it. You could give that a shot.
VEXE2k6Saa	I also bought the one for brown eyes called Black Pearl and noticed NO difference. I've used CG's Lash Exact since it came out and I absolutely love it.

I saw no difference.|`|KGppArcfaa	I hated it. I love LashBlast so I thought i'd try this one, it clumped my lashes, and didnt do anything to brighten my eyes at all. The colour shows up on the brush, but not on your lashes. I really didnt like it, i want to try the new one, Lash blast luxe or something, it has the same brush as lash blast and is supposed to add shimmer or something...
SQWvMx6Maa	I don't think it's dumb I wear fake lip rings. I don't pierce my lip because my parents would throw me out.
t3A9qpQIaa	Trying too hard is jealous talk.  According to her you better not look your best or you will outclass the plainer girls and they won't like it.  Swept up on top of your head would be stunning.  Nothing beats simple elegance.  You want heads to turn don't you?  A long sheer scarf backwards on your neck with the ends hanging down your back would finish it off. Being vulgar like your one answer detracts from your beauty.  So unlady like.|`|zFKULGWfaa	Have your hair in pig tails   It Will make you look really Funky!

0LkHjGAaaa	Yeah, Delia's has some weird sizing for some reason. I get stuff from there from time to time and the sizes that fit me are way smaller than the ones they suggest on the website.

ucpMOO6Uaa	My Little nephew just a week ago told me that I'm the best Auntie in the world :) That made me so happy.   He said that He wants to be just like me and go to the same college and do the same course (I'm studying forensic Science, he's 9, and I've been teaching him tricks of the trade. We even do dissections together!)

She tries to wear similar clothes to mine and always has to put on the same perfume as me. She would wear the same make-up if I would let her, but she's too young lol. Oh and she has to have the same hair. It's really cute except when my things go missing, or she attempts to use my make-up and just makes a mess lol. I don't really know if that's being her role model, or just being her sister lol.    And my neice, who's also my godchild, Sasha, adores me at the moment lol. I think it's because she's got a baby sister now so she tries to get as much attention as possible lol.|`|d5ug5W5kaa	yeah im pretty sure! haha  the little girl i babysit absolutely loves me. same with my little cousin.|`|nzCxfFNyaa	y44|`|lkNJNnlSaa	not yet|`|c9aaa62ae49fd88ebc431c66a11f06b1aa	I try to be a good role model to my kids.

c2cfafa045c1cfca6abe9c25b6c12b32aa	It sounds like your doing everything right. If they cut your hair longer then you ask then I would refuse to pay them! You might try asking them for a "baby trim" and make absolutely sure that they know you only want an inch off. Ask them to measure the amount and show it to you before they cut it.|`|AA10378447	The way to keep it healthier would be to stop trimming it only every three months. Problem solved.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	well , instead of straightning your hair EVERYDAY , since i highly doubt that you go somewhere every single day , dont straighten your hair . even during the week or something , if your too tired or something , and dont feel like straightning your hair , dont ! just put it up in a ponytail , and just straighten your bangs or something :]  trust me , i have the saaaame problem ! and theyre probably just cutting three inches off because they want to get rid of ALL the dead ends , not just an inch of them . they just mean well , and your hair will actually grow back faster .

Instead of having dinner what about walking to a nearby pizza place?  Watching a movie is fun.  Try playing truth or dare. (pretty old-fashioned)  Then idk, go talk about random things (clothes, boys, etc.)  Have fun.|`|AGbusTqGaa	Once you guys all get together youll figure stuff out.

Then you can all try on clothes, and you can treat each one of your friends to one piece (or you can just tell them to bring money; that way, they can get everything they want, too).  If you're into the whole spa thing, get at-home mani/pedis. It's always fun and super relaxing. You can also ask them to bring face mask stuff. Make sure to get all of your friends comfy robes.  For dinner, why not get a ton of people together and go somewhere fun (and cheap... think California Pizza Kitchen, Red Robin, ect). Then, just bring the people who are spending the night back with you. That way, you can hang out with all of your friends. You can also go out to a super nice dinner (post spa treatments and/or at home shopping), just the five of you.      I hope this helps!|`|FibIwPLzaa	You guys should be fine!  im 14 too! and kinda girly and it sounds like stuff i would wanna do  but instead of stayi8n there go to the movies and the mall or something. dont sit in the house all night  that can get boring sometimes...

Having too tight of a dress is going to make you look SUPER tiny, and make you look shorter :).    Here are a few ideas on dresses:  http://www.gojane.com/27018-formals-sati...  http://www.gojane.com/29710-formals-sequ...  http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_detail....  http://www.jessicamcclintock.com/webapp/...  http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_detail....      Hiar color isnt too much of a problem, as long as you try to stay away from a super bright yellow. :).    As for shoes, you should go for simple strappy heels:  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2944683?refs...    And as for hairstyle, you should either go for a half up half down, because the layers will make for an easy half up half down look, or you can do a simple full updo by styling the layers by clipping them up.    here are a few ideas:  http://ivanasusanti.com/sbblog/wp-conten...  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_r3B9lL7KwY0/R_...    good luck!|`|	Since you seem to be a natural red head I definitely recommend colors which compliment both your skin tone and hair color. For really dark red hair color anything along the lines of "earth toned" colors work best. Those would be your olive greens, browns, beige's, golds and orange reds. I prefer turquoise and any emerald greens which give an "Ariel- The Little Mermaid" sort of effect. My favourite red-head is Jesse Cruikshank who is one of the hosts of MTV Canada she is a great fashion figure. For strawberry blonde or light auburn hair you will probably have peach or golden undertones to the skin and have green or blue eyes. You can wear most spring colors: apricot, beige, golden yellows and peachy pinks, but marine and violet blues or aqua can also look great.    For hair: I really do love updo's on any person because they compliment many hair types and are mostly very simple and easy to do plus they're quite chic. Here are some classic pictures :     http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/C/m/prom...  http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/9/m/kate...  http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/B/m/prom...  http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/7/m/yvet...  http://cn1.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/d9/...  http://images.totalbeauty.com/content/ph...    Lastly I think short dresses such as a halter top and strapless work great with a smaller figure.The dresses should fall above the knees at most. Look at Nicole Richie for example, shes very petite but looks great in strapless dresses. Here are some links to some dress choices. enjoy! :

c5NQ4QCEaa	I got some lemon essential oil that I use with several floral fragrances.  It seems to add freshness to them, much in the same way lemon adds freshness to many vegetables in cooking.  I've used it with Kai, lilac & Honeysuckle fragrances.

kCdISEGqaa	I think it's a great idea, but, I would caution you, are you Native American?  If it is a tattoo to honor the struggles of the native people, make sure it reflects that.  Many Native American people take offense to non-natives getting tattoos of a tribal nature or otherwise.  I am not trying to discourage you, just trying to bring to your attention that it can be offensive.  It would be like a white man getting a portrait of Martin Luther King, Jr. with a quote saying, "I have a dream."

lPCjNkEnaa	Cut an unwaxed cucumber into slices, cool in refrigerator and place on eyes for 10 minutes. The cooling properties relax puffiness. <br>  Massage with almond oil under and around eyes.<br>  Massage with peanut oil under and around eyes.<br>  Place two tea bags (preferably chamomile tea) in cold water for 5 minutes, than place on eyes for 10 minutes.<br>  Apply a paste of turmeric powder with pineapple juice, rinse after 5 minutes (be sure not to get into eyes).<br>  Grate an unwaxed cucumber or a small scrubbed (preferably red) potato. Put the gratings on two gauze pads, than place on eyes for 10 minutes.<br>  Apply a mixture of lemon juice and tomato juice, let sit for 5 minutes, than rinse (be sure not to get into eyes).<br>  Apply crushed mint leaves under the eyes for 20 minutes.<br>  Dip cotton balls in rose water and apply to under eye for 10 minutes.<br>  Eat foods rich in vitamin E, vitamin C, and iron.<br>  Exercise to get the blood flowing into your face and into your under eye area.|`|tWTSNI2qaa	You have to find out what is causing it. Is it lack of sleep? If it is, all you need is sleep at least 8 hours each day.<br>  <br>  If it is hereditary then (while you can't completely eliminate it) you could camouflage it with make up.<br>  <br>  Now if this is caused by allergies to dust or pollen, you might be able to prevent the dark circles by NOT scratching or rubbing your eyes when they get itchy. Instead, rinse the eye area, with "cool" water to get rid of the "itchy" feeling.<br>  <br>  The eye area (where dark circles form) is very delicate and any rubbing will make dark circles worse so the best way to prevent the circles is to keep your hands away from your eye area as much as possible.

If you want to take a break from straightening it,   Scrunch it with gell and hairspray and wear it curlly.    good luck!|`|5JumtCTGaa	omg i did that too it is addicting isn't it lol jokes     well if u straighten it the next day it still should be straight    u should use some mousterizer and straightening balm!!     hope this helps and goodluck don't worry about it u will stop evebtually i did!|`|Q88a9Zpaaa	Hi blah I obtained an answer to your question at below websites.

If ur noticing that ur hair strands break off very easily in the middle of the strand, then its really damaged so its probably time for a haircut..... also u can use anti-heat products (ones from the Treseme line are good)so that the straightener doesnt kill ur hair as much, and fi you blow dyr it straight using a comb, then that decreases the amount of time that you straighten your hair cuz its already kinda straight....also, you need a good straightener, one form maybe Conair because if you use a bad straightener, it doesnt straighten as well and it takes FOREVER. Hope this helps....i know what a pain in the *** it can be when you have natural hair thats annoying.|`|KkT74UsPaa	u should were it in like a pony tail or a cute bun. if that doesnt halp u should get fructice straight and silky thats what i use and i dont usualy helps my hair. if that doesnt help go to a solon and ask.|`|z2zZCJDRaa	Use Hot Sets by garnier frutise (or however you spell it)

Boil the water on low gas and keep adding water as it evaporates. Boil the water for an hour.   Cool the water and then strain.   Put the prepared liquid in a spray bottle. This water can be refrigerated and used for only a week.   TIP   Use orange for dry hair.   If the liquid is very sticky add more water to it.

eEznnpnVaa	That sounds completely normal. You'll find dried blood for the first week or two, then the only residue you should get should be dry, yellow crusty lymph. Try to sleep on the opposite side at night--that's what's causing the irritation. Other than that, keep up with cleaning it and keeping your hair out of it and it should heal fine.<br>  <br>  Cleaning** Do NOT use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, neosporin, or anything like that. Alcohol is way too harsh to use on ANY piercing, hydrogen peroxide is TOXIC [corrosive] to your tissue and is not to be used on any open wounds, neosporin and other similar ointments clog the piercing which doesn't allow it to "breath" for optimal healing. <br>  <br>  Use orange bottle dial soap in the shower and spray some bactine on it whenever you feel you've contaminated it [after exercise, touching it etc]. The great thing about bactine is that you can take it with you!|`|laSBohonaa	its normal! it will hurt for a little bit just keep on cleaning it and you should be fine|`|Au4gWgEiaa	It is likely because you rolled around on it when it is freshly pierced.  It's best not to do that for the first couple weeks.  Continue to clean it once a day and try doing sea salt soaks at least once a day and hopefully that will help it.  If it gets worse, then get it checked out!  The yellow stuff is probably just regular discharge from it trying to heal.  Hope this helps you out!|`|VdrAByWjaa	See your doctor! Cartilage piercings are basically disease traps. If it swells too much your cartilage can swell and shatter, just like glass. Trust me, you don't want shattered cartilage. I've seen it many times. I would use ice to bring the swelling down. Massage some Neosporin on the hole. If it doesn't get better within a week or so, call your doctor.|`|ljeoSQhDaa	since the cartilage part of the ear is more sensitive you should disinfect it with alcohol...also i don't think you should worry too much about the blooding because it has only been awhile since you got it pierced...and try not too touch it too much when your hands are dirty that can make it worse.

EGlSesYjaa	Dresses above the knee help a great deal. Also, form fitting dressing will make you look less stumpy. If you really want to elongate your legs tho, go for a high waisted style or something like this: http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8347... I suggest the black and white.    I am also very petite (4'11) with short legs and I tried on that dress, it makes me look some much taller.    Also, If you want to wear a short dress without looking trashy or bleing cold-- wear it with black tights and black heels (or flats on a casual occasion). The black lengthen your legs and since it would be the same color as the heels gives the illusion that you're taller and have long legs!|`|LXCfeUbjaa	get a dress you want, and then have it tailored to shorten it.|`|ISljRZIRaa	short dresses make u look taller. as long as it doesn't go past ur knees, then u should look good.|`|OuaUAAZlaa	short dresses and skirts/mini-skirts.  dont worry, they wont look super short on ya.    if you dont want to wear short skirts, avoid dresses/skirts that hang below the knee (unless of course its a long dress/skirt thats supposed to be ankle length)    or you could wear high heels.    hope this helps !! :)

9Vfzi0U2aa	It usually is normal when you first get your piercing because your mouth is adjusting to it.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	I doubt it's normal. I know it's normal to have an indent when it's too tight, but I've never heard of anyone having any type of tear. I'm sure it will heal up normally if you take care of it, but remember that human mouths have a lot of bacteria, and it's best if you pay close attention to it and keep your fingers off of it!|`|98BZdVGJaa	ouch. i would see a doctor!|`|u9CFPBkWaa	All I have to say is OUCH!!!!!!! why would you do that????? painfull!|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes|`|NAJLZqHXaa	well i dont know but email and answer this question plz..did getting that hurt and do u have a high tolerance for pain? cuz i dont and i really wanna get 1 =[|`|Xw2JFBVpaa	nope. it's often the start of a horrible, painful infection that results in your lip falling off.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	It is a puncture wound, there is always a possibility that it could actually get small tears around the circumference. get it checked with your piercer to see if it's a normal amount of tearing or if it's something to take the piercing out for.|`|22PSjyM9aa	i wouldn't say that's normal. i would wait a bit and see if it gets worse. if it does tell someone and see a doctor.|`|wPucIiwjaa	Where is the piercing at? and what does the back of it look like? Is it flat or did you get a ball?  I recently got my lip pierced (about a month ago) and that doesn't sound normal.  I have a flat end on mine and I have an indent looking thingy on the inside of my mouth, that's normal.  I would call who ever did the piercing for you. And if you did it yourself or had someone do it for you go to the doctor asap! but don't take it out because you can close up the wound and trap an possible infections in your skin (eww).
QuQioUd7aa	why not just take them out?|`|2diobki7aa	I used to have one or two over the summer.  And I never had a problem while sleeping with them in.  You should be fine.

uzzvz3uDaa	Totally bring a resume, with your name and your number. You can simply tell the interviewer that you didn't put in all your info the day you signed up and that you have a resume. I did that and i think it gave me an edge. The interview is a pretty easy thing to nail if you do all the right things. First you should wear something hollister. Look very natural and vibe off with the beachy so cal look.One thing i did was wear the colors the hollister employees wear. Ex. Gray, Navy, or White. Don't wear a ton of make up, look natural and BE ON TIME! They would make you wait in the lounge until the interviewer arrives. She would take you to a secluded part of the mall and begin the interview. O yea its a group interview..so you might be with other 5 or 6 people. Always smile and be attentive. They will ask you 4 simple questions. For me it was:  -Name your best quality?  -What does diversity mean to you?  -What are you successful in?  -What makes hollister different from other stores?  I was extremely nervous. But all you have to do answer it as unique as possible. Don't give the usual respond everyone is giving. Be different, make sure the interviewer knows you are different.Also try to give examples when you answer. like say if you are an artistic person. dont just say it, give examples to show that you really are. Speak with clarity, don't mumble or stutter. It will look like you aren't good talking to people. They then tell you they will call u in about a week. I had my interview on a Tuesday and received a call on Friday. Be yourself and really cool. The last thing you want to seem is fake or shy. GOOD LUCK!!|`|QcX4fugiaa	i don't work there, but other people have said to just wear hollister stuff and flip flops.|`|YGpciehTaa	wear something from hollister  but not too obvious dont like wear  a shirt that says hollister across it  jsut play it cool, look pretty and be respectful  and yes bring your resume you'll walk in  and depending on the time  you'll probably have to wait  then u'll go in and have a 1 to 1 interview  its nothing big dont sweat it :)  just look pretty haha

JBLMKjm1aa	i used burt's bee's and it happened to me too:/     i suggest anything from bath&body works...its great.  you can also always stick with carmex and blistex!  those two are always the best!|`|TNAvb9Tgaa	NIVEA- it's the smoothest one i've tried and has NO problems.  and at night, try putting on a coating of Rosebud Salve before going to sleep, you'll wake up with super soft lips that;ll last.    soft lips left a residue on my lips   burt's bees only had a good feeling but did not do anything to moisturize, it actually made my lips burn  chapstick had a residue too.|`|NOFHz1RIaa	Carmex, Blistex and try messing around with them, no one ones what will work great for your lips!|`|ZEvtVkuuaa	Burt's Bee's should not do that...

DONT RUSH AND RINSE IT OFF GIVE IT 15 MIN EXTRA THAN THE TIME THE BOX SAYS AND HOPEFULLY IT WONT TURN ORANGE.

Anything different then 2 consecutive numbers can definately pose a problem!

wyCJ365oaa	At 17, you're done growing and you're not tall enough. People guessing you're a certain height doesn't make you that height.

She won't model ever.|`|hdEyMfzQaa	You don't have to be 5'8" for everyone to know.  Their is such thing as "Petite" modeling.  for those from 5' t 5'6"   they do just as well. And I'm not sure. You fit the standards but a picture would help.    And to the other cmmt, everyone needs a little boost here or there.  go for it, girl.|`|NURfu4ngaa	Models come in all shapes and sizes...if you want to model try barbazon modeling. You do have to pay for the classes. Theres different classes for acting, practice taking photos and so on.

And im 5'2.....|`|q3fK9CQaaa	Ugh, don't listen to what most people are going to say, you never know. There's different kinds of modeling and there's a good amount of famous models that stand at that height. If you are extremely good looking and you have an exotic look, you might just do it. It might not work for you but you never know stop asking a bunch of strangers that's never going to help, it sounds like your fishing for compliments and that's no good.

be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	You'll want to get a comb and some hairspray. First hold your hair up straight and come *towards* your head- this is called teasing or back-combing. Do that a few times gently to get lift. By doing this you will create a "poof" then lightly smooth the top hairs over with the comb and place your bangs where you want them.     It might take some practice to get it just right, but you'll get the idea.     Hope this helps!!
AA6Aq94vaa	Go into the women's shoe section see if there is anything you like that fits   In the USA, womens sizes are 1 size larger than mens. so if you are a size 10 men's you would want a size 11 women's   Most stores carry up to size 10 womens. Many carry 11 to 13, anything higher than that and you will need a specialty shop.   Askso, Skecher's tend to be a bit wider than most women's shoes, so they may be a bit more comfortable on your feet|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Usually men's sizes run 1 size bigger then women's, so if you wear a Men's size 12 you would wear a size 13 women's shoe.  I usually shop at Marylandsquare.com.  they have the best Selection and decent prices.  The specialize in larger women's sizes.|`|vGYhqwHaaa	if you live close to any big city there will be some kind of drag or crossdressing specialty store.

URLq6zIDaa	white....duh.|`|MHTIe6hTaa	wear neon colors.|`|GAxHzgEEaa	you should probably wear a lot of white   like white sneakers and shirts.  you should also wear those glow necklaces  and if you want to spice it up  maybe you should go to this website to have some ideas nobody else would have  http://www.lightgod.com/|`|AA11560862	Wear some neon colors or white, but make your outfit mostly black. Oh, and buy some of those glowsticks that you can make into braclets, necklaces, headbands, etc.|`|of049X1waa	White glows, and so does highlighter.  Try drawing on yourself with a highlighter, in yellow.  It will not be visible in the normal light, but in the blacklight it glows like crazy!|`|mfBkH3qtaa	White glows BIG time! Also you can draw on yourself with YELLOW highlighter and it's not too visible. But in black light is crazy bright! Also neon colors work! I also have this black shirt with yellow stars on it. I've worn it under a black light and I certainly stood out so try something like that! Or by a plain white tee and draw with highlighter on it! A dark color with white stripes or something would also look cool! Or you could wear a plain white tee and let your friends draw on the shirt!|`|7LJZ7VrEaa	there are also some really awsome contacts that go with black lights they show up great and you cant get them online for like 5$ they look really neat in the black light
C5Wlt3rGaa	Maybe your skin type and the Clinique 3 Step System don't match.  Just because the brand looks nice, doesn't always mean its nice for your skin.  Try a different brand of moisturizers.  It will go a LONG way if you find the right one!|`|82e3eb215485ac8bca5c7c3854ee30ecaa	Get a facial cleanser, like Queen Helene wash with ground walnut and oatmeal.  It will exfoliate the dry skin off your face and it will be smooth.  It's that time of year, and the winter does that to skin.|`|eBT6dNOcaa	buy products that are specifically for dry skin.    you may be doing a 3 step system but it could be making it worse.|`|KrC3asyRaa	sounds like your clinique is not suitable for your skin    if your in australia, sydney.   i can offer you a free skincare consultation, and let you try our products free. alternatively you can check out my website    http://www.nutrimetics.com.au/leanneleac...
wi59vRgmaa	try getting a bleaching kit and do it yerself|`|CtHi5L78aa	you need to tone it and it wont turn darker.. you need something with a ash, or purle base|`|PNLwOIOraa	get a ash blonde color from like cvs or something?|`|0d4X54rMaa	try an ash toner|`|sMABbl71aa	DON'T LISTEN TO ANY OF THE ASH TONERS.    if your hair is yellow you need a purple/violette toner. purple cancels out yellow.     go to sally's beauty supply and get purple toner, they will help you..don't leave it on longer than it says thought because it might cause your hair to look a little ashy (if this happens it will fade in a few days don't worry!)        ***If you tone your hair correctly it won't make it darker, an overlay would make it darker. Blue cancels out orange tones. You need to use purple, trust me I've done a lot of blond hair and i know what i'm talking about. I'd use 20 vol. because it's less harsh and you don't need to lift the hair anymore. Because you're hair is so porous now if you do an overlay it will make your hair darker. Use a Purple toner to remove the yellow tones. The toner will NOT make your hair darker, I promise!|`|zWB3jHHPaa	HAHA. thats what you get for wanting to be a blonde. And from what i read, it sounds like all along you were just a blonde in disguise LMAO!

While the first outfit is technically more 'scene' than the second (which is actually more 80s), the second does a far better job at color coordination. With the first outfit, I feel the pink in the outfit isn't broken up very well. And the hoodie is pretty ugly.    For Preppy, Outfit Two.  Outfit one is not 'preppy' at all. It just screams "elitist-high-school-Abercrombie-slut" to me.    For Casual, Outfit Two.   I guess I just like the simplicity of it. The first looks like trying too hard. And how structured and rigid the bag in the second outfit is just doesn't jive well with the theme 'casual' for me.|`|9eDHf11haa	Scene- 1st  Preppy- if i didnt have to choose someone it would be neither but since i have to it would be the 1st  Casual-1st    sorry 2nd person.....|`|ADkusTVXaa	Scene - 2    Preppy - 1    Casual - 1
r4xRkqzdaa	i would look at the quality of the products you are using- if you are buying your makeup at target, you aren't going to get the best or the healthiest products!    your order is correct, but make sure you are using a TRANSLUCENT powder, not a full coverage one.... if you use liquid foundation you don't need the extra double the coverage    also, if your face gets dry, make sure you exfoliate your skin.  i use a gentle exfoliating wash by philosophy and it works wonders.  you have to remove the old dead skin cells 1st|`|Oae9mimmaa	use less!  try bare minerals;didnt work for me(they didnt have a pale enough shade lol)  but it has worked for everyone else i know.  it covers your flaws,withought looking fake.it feels like YOUR skin,not a thick layer of grossness.  i didn think itd work cause its so thin,but it actually covered everything like acne and color blotches.its kind of expensive,so save up ur allowance.it doesnt look fake at all.|`|xY65R25kaa	Maybe you are putting on too much.  Or maybe you have the wrong color for your skin tone.    Just suggestions, I cant really tell without seeing it directly.      It could also be bad makeup..|`|7o957DMlaa	It sounds right but only apply the liquid in places you need it..  like under eyes and on blemishes|`|FijSI1v2aa	the problem is you dont need the powder to make your makeup or foundation stay in place because all that does is it makes your skin look thick and fake. what your do is use a primer for your foundation. i would definately recodmend  http://www.smashbox.com/PHOTO-FINISH-FOU...  you can still use the powder but if you are using a kubuki brush tap all the excess powder so you dont put alot.  and for the liquid foundation .women use more then they really need.take a liquid foundation brush and dip it in not too much just a little bit and start applying to that area and start spreading it evenly to one side of your face|`|SBZOVEueaa	use a sponge to apply your foundation, not your fingers    apply a light streak of foundation down the middle of forehead sweep out until forehead is covered    the same w/cheeks nose and chin    finish w/a light dusting of powder (brush)|`|EzSeccrLaa	try a different shade and/or use less make up|`|gvgFfPwQaa	Try mixing your moisturizer with your liquid foundation (same effect as the moisturizer first) but it thins the liquid out so that it is more natural looking. Second only use a powder brush to apply powder and never use a powder that puts more color on the face. Only use translucent Loose powder (very important, cake powders are too thick and makes it look like you are wearing a mask). if you get too shiny during the day use the oil blotting papers on your face to soak up the oil that comes during the day. Maybe you should try a foundation that is for active wear like sport foundation, it tends to be less cakey. If you apply makeup with a sponge... stop... use your fingers as this will melt the makeup slightly and make it go on better and thinner. Main thing is just thin down the makeup with water or moisturizer and use loose powder with a fluffy brush not puff. This makes all the difference in the world, trust me! Oh, and make sure that your foundation matches your skin perfectly any slight difference in color will make it look even more fake.|`|eFLiKTB3aa	well, when i apply makeup, i wash my face with a moisturizing cleaner. that way, your my skin doesn't go all oily when i apply the foundation, and i make sure i use a sponge to apply it evenly. if that doesn't work, try using a different shade of foundation.|`|apALY0sqaa	The order is correct. And there can be several reasons for this.     Make-up quality is one, you get what you paid for. You cheap make-up and you get cheap results.    How you apply the foundation. Try using a sponge or a good base-brush. Blend well, and in downward and out motions, with the hairs on your face. Blending up can distrupt the way they lay and make the make-up look heavier.    The moisturizer you use. Try to get one as light as possible, and as natural as possible. The more synthetic it is, the more it clogs pores, and makes your make-up "float" and not blend properly.    Use translucent powder if you can, or even mineral powder foundation. It makes the look cleaner and neater over all, and you don't look fake and plastered over.    I would also use a good exfoliant once a week or so to sluff off dead skin and cells. Also, a good hydroxy mask helps as well. St. Ives makes one that is great. It goes on and dries, and you peel it off and it tightens your pores so they don't hold as much make-up (which helps the make-up issue down the road!)|`|94KnUvDIaa	your doing the steps in the right order ... but here are some tips...    1. wash face and dry  2. apply moisturizer... make sure it dries... wait like 5 minutes until it soaks in... your foundation will cake on top of it if you don't    orrr    mix your liquid foundation with your moisturizer... it will thin it out but still give you the coverage and moisture you need    ( i'm thinking that maybe you use way too much foundation at one time. it should be no more than a dime sized amount... or even less!!! )    4. apply powder ...   don't apply too much.  you just want a light dusting... and if you're not already... try using a translucent powder... it doesnt have as much pigment and is simply just for a matte finnish... a light light dusting will do the trick.|`|2b7NEgyMaa	go to make up counter n ask d make up artst to advice u on wht color  Suits u best.conceal ur dark circle n dark spot with concealer (. One shade lighter than ur normal powder.)after moisturizer n primer .use loose powder for lighter coverage..make sure u shape ur eye brows  n wear eye liner n mascara. Then blusher n natural color lipstick.if u applied just d powder alone, without shaping ur eyebrows d result is u gonna look pale like a zombie.
AA11910088	Well you can get some pads for the back of the shoes. Try that other than that you may have too take them back and get your right size=))
IiKBLjIpaa	Well I use Long Term Relationship and my hair is really soft. It is suppose to help prevent split ends. Also, if your hair is really dry, you should know that you shouldn't be washing your hair every day. When you take a shower, skip the shampoo every other day and just use conditioner. Washing your hair every day isn't good for your scalp and dries out your hair and makes it frizzy.|`|dsBCGbWpaa	The formulas for herbal essences are all the same, so just pick the scent you like best. I use herbal essences body envy and a guy in my class told me my hair looked shinier than usual and asked if I had switched shampoos. Best of luck!

Unless you are spending thousands of dollars for one bag, you are buying counterfeit. Fake chanel bags are made in asia by children. The kids' parents sell the kids to factory owners to get money because the factory owners promise food and shelter for the kids, which is a lie. They work all day and all night for almost no money and no food. Many kids die there and if they survive, they spend their entire childhood in those factories. If you buy counterfeit items, you are supporting child labor. This is fact.    ways to spot counterfeit anything: crooked logos, cheap fabric, rips, tears, or any loose strings, you see other people with the same thing, it is sold on sale, it had a plastic or paper tag with a cheap tie to it. Real items are hundreds or even thousands of dollars and have perfect labels and cloth tags sewn onto the bag. Designers also add special details to their products to prevent fraud.

That dress is really pretty too.|`|UThG15FLaa	Wow beautiful dress ;]    - Of course it's not a bad thing to be wearing a white dress to prom, White is elegant, and one of my favorite colours ;).  White will most defiantly make you want to stand out, and im most positive you will.    No need to worry, your going to look great Hun.  ? Deeee|`|FpF6tuzpaa	of course not. white is so graceful and elegant. you will look fabulous!|`|vQjxFvaGaa	no...  whit is a color for like anythin.... plus that dress is GEORGOUS|`|KIhK4cAhaa	don't be afraid of anything . wear what ever you want to wear .don't think of  what people say just don't worry and wear your dream dress to the prom|`|56eAArieaa	go 4 it lov dress white or ivory very in|`|ouosH0t8aa	no! but it really depends on the style of the dress. That one looks fine to me. Very angelic. I think it's great.  I plan to wear a white dress to prom myself. Well, actually, mine's more of an off-white cream color.|`|JQCqrpqnaa	I've seen alot of people at my past high school proms wear white dresses. its not a bad color at all. sure, people associate white with weddings but sometimes brides don't even wear white. white is classy and im sure you'll be able to pull it off easily. try adding sparkly accessories or a tiara, that will bring out more of a prom vibe.|`|M7LCB12Aaa	No one usually wear a silky white to prom. The closest would be a creme color. White isn't the best color for prom. I would rather go black then white.|`|BZt3Z1gYaa	well in my opinion its not. its a beautiful dress and if you feel awkward wearing it then just add sum accessories idk to make it seem more with color then just white, just to make it different so u kan be more comfortable. and as far as im concerned you shouldn't care if it is or if it isn't because its a glamorous dress and perfect for prom          hope i helped...~roseangel~|`|J33OCEQaaa	like 8 girls wore white to my prom last year they looked amazing.  and that dress you picked is GORGEOUS :)|`|igrdohopaa	Absolutely not! that dress is flawless! (=|`|x3mFm4exaa	I think that dress is cute but personally I wouldn't wear it to prom  not because of the color but because of the style, white is a cute color for prom though|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	White has always been normal to wear to prom.  Just be careful not to spill anything on it.|`|p3qrj7HDaa	I don't think it's tacky, but it's definitely risky! I mean, are you going to sit down, eat, or drink anything that night?

I think you are only worrying about it when it is perfectly fine!|`|8Zmt87LOaa	Don't worry about it!  You are a pretty young girl and your features are just part of who you are.  So many people are self conscious of little things and they shouldn't be.
of049X1waa	Go darker.  Dark hair is a lot prettier (imho) than blonde, and it is also easier to maintain.  Streaks are a little cliche, and kind of going out of fashion.  Maybe you could dye your tips a bright color, like just the very ends of your hair.  That is dramatic and unexpected, rare.  Or, if you're especially daring, you could dye your ROOTS a funky color.  It looks cool, because people are like, "What?!  Your hair is growing out and it was dyed brown?  and is naturally.. blue??"  Well obviously no one says that... but they think it for a second!  Then it is cool because as it grows out you get a kind of halo effect that is fun and looks cool.  Since your hair is curly, it won't look too exact, which will be good.    I am going to have to advise you against the lip ring.  They are very very bad for you, and most places won't pierce a 14 year old girl.  If you are dead set on a facial piercing, you should try your eyebrow--those are the least dangerous facial piercings, and don't get in the way when you put on chapstick!|`|asEV10aXaa	thats not creative thats posing off of scene kids. If you want to do something creative shave your initials into your head. I bet no one in your school has done that|`|lMkHxqgzaa	Don't do that...  Get a cool haircut that you are comforable in. That makes you feel you. Or even dye your hair another color... like light brown or black. Or get highlights!  Hope it helps....|`|NuzNgXURaa	don't pierce your lip! that's trying sooo hard to stand out-just get some cool layers, bangs or highlights! maybe try getting some long extensions!|`|4EIebdn1aa	Maybe some highlights!  Lip loops are cute just make sure you take them off before you kiss someone because I heard that hurts.

I have the same skin type so thats what works for me.
IKyITYICaa	Nowadays they airbrush, use lighting techniques, and makeup to cover up blemishes like that.  If you have good bone structure and look good with makeup then get yourself some professionally made photos highlighting how you look at your best.  If you take this portfolio with you and show the modeling agency, they may see your potential and decide to work with you.  I had a girlfriend who was a model and she did NOT have perfect skin.  But you look at her pictures and you cannot tell that she had some acne.  With the right makeup, she looked like a supermodel.  Photographers know how to hide your marks if the rest of you looks good.   I have seen models and actresses that look absolutely perfect on screen or in photos but when you see them up close you can tell they have acne or other stuff going on.  If this is really what you want to do then do whatever it takes to maximize your talent (working out, eating right, skin and hair treatments, etc).  And don't take no for an answer.  Keep knocking on a hundred doors until someone says 'yes'.|`|46nFI18Haa	they photoshop most of the images so give it ur best shot|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Not in the modeling industry.|`|CO5jcxMraa	sorry but no    i have psoriasis too but i only get it if im streeed out or if im getting really little sleep    so try sleeping more|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	go on americas next top model. many girls have acne, skin conditions, jacked up teeth, and they still accept them  and even sometimes pay for treatments and stuff to fix it|`|6sAbs2iiaa	There is many models out there that looks like s... when they wakeup in the morning these days everything is computuralized I can even take out all your acne in the picture using adobe photo  no big deal just it's gross.|`|BifE4q7Baa	maybe you could model specifically for skin conditions, like proactive commercials, etc.?  You would get free treatment and you could pursue your modeling aspirations after|`|WnbaA1S0aa	There are a lot of products on the market which aim to eliminate acne and psoriasis. Go to your local pharmacy and they will give you a hand in choosing some. You may need to be persistant and try a few different products because what works for one person may not work for another. Models are chosen because they look supremely good and people want to look at them because they're meant to be perfect. First get rid of your acne and psoriasis and then get your modeling career going. Good luck =)|`|zwGl1lq3aa	If your tall thats what matters most. You will grow out of your acne probably ..how old are you?  But acne is big to really get a spot which is already so limited you would need to be the best you can be so i say wait then try modeling!!   :)|`|4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	I do not want to hurt you, but we live in a judgmental society. So, I would say yes they might.   You really do need a doctoral medicated cream for your psoriasis. That is not just a physical thing. You should really take care of that. I think that is something that you may combat all your life. I do not know if your using medication or not. It doesn't say.   As far as your acne....models are judged on their bodies and their face. If its noticeable....it could hurt you if its a choice between you and someone else. However...some people are chosen for jobs because of their acne. Janice Dickinson's Modeling Agency show had a number of models with mild to severe acne and there was an acne company that came to them with a job.    Acne happens to the best of us. Remember: what you see in magazines is not real!!!! Half of those models are so touched up, they might not even recognize themselves. If you've got the gift of modeling or acting...nothing is going to stop you...not dry skin or a few pimples. Its not your psoriasis or acne that is deciding your life is it???? If you've got the walk, the face, and the body....all others will fall into place.   Keep at it. Models come in all shapes and sizes and not all models have perfect skin. Its a fact. Good luck in all you do.

6CMfKxiMaa	that stuff is tolerable, at times.  it's extremely over-rated though.  it's rather lame when you wear like a shirt to the mall, and see like 5 people wearing the same, or near the same, shirt.  i personally hate when people will buy a bunch of shirts or hoodies that only have the brand name on it though. it's so ridiculous, why do so many people pay like 40.00 for the word "hollister" with Maybe a stupid little bird on their ****? it's not cute or anything it's just advertising and is just for fools ;)  i like some of those places clothes, but i actually prefer something with style and not just advertising.|`|TwXJS1thaa	I like abercrombie, hollister, american eagle and banana republic but i dont shop at there all the time.

p9mB8Z2Kaa	Get a toner  A facial scrub  Oil free facial lotion   Acne spot treatment    I suggest to get all this in neautrogena    -first your gonna need to stop popping your zits. This can leave scars and make pimples worse  -use salicylic acid to clear your pimples and an astringent in a toner.  -remove any makeup you have on your face. If you leave makeup on for too long the oil clogs your pores.  - use a washcloth. Pour warm to hot water on your wash cloth and put the washcloth on your forehead and leave it there for five minutes to open your pores.  -next splash warm water on your face and massage the facial scrub onto your face and rinse.  -next use your astringent toner and rub it on your face. Let it airdry.   -now use your oil free face lotion and wait a few minutes   -now use your acne spot treatment and dab It onto your worst pimples         Maintain a routine. Do this every night and every morning even when your Acne is cleared up. If ypindont keep doing it thebacne will come back.          Use a facial mask about once a week to open pores and get the salicylic acid deep into your pores. Salicylic acid by the way is a medication that clears up your skin quick and also prevents wrinkles.|`|ai1tYPFQaa	IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WHOLE REGIMEN THEN I WOULD GO WITH EITHER MURAD OR DERMELOGICA.IF YOU WANT JUST A SPOT TREATMENT,DERMA DOCTOR HAS A FANTASTIC ONE.YOU CAN FIND THESE AT ULTA OR SEPHORA|`|2whsjuSgaa	Proactive!

sPQBluKEaa	you could pretty much stop being gay and ugly. maybe then you'd be pretty! =].|`|wXloRCegaa	Brown eyes can get away with wearing almost any color of eyeshadow. But if you want you eyes to pop then try either green eyeshadow or pink eyeshadow. With brown eyes, you can also use blue eyeshadow, and if you have gold flecks in your eyes you may want to try an eyeshadow that has a gold shimmer to it. Brown eyes can even pull-off wearing brown eyeshadow, but be careful because certain tones can look muddy against your beautiful brown eyes.    Keep in mind that you should have fun with your eyeshadow and it shouldn't be a bothersome process. A general rule of thumb with eyeshadow is to first compliment your eye color and then it shouldn't contrast your clothing. In other words, don't wear a purple based eyeshadow on your blue eyes while you are wearing a coral toned shirt. You should try to keep your clothing and eyeshadow in the same or color family, or at least a complimentary family. And finally, remember that sometimes less is more. Don't add 5 layers of green eyeshadow on your brown eyes, thinking that it will make them look fabulous. Often times a slight hint of color is all your eyes need to really pop and look mesmerizing.|`|XEZfFFSmaa	like some nice blues or greens look really nice.

Fd4EBV1Vaa	Toni and Guy have got some great products to volumise hair. You can get them from either your local Toni & Guy salon or from Boots. Blow drying adds a lot of volume to hair, especially if you turn your head upside-down you should spray a bit of Toni & Guy Brunette Blow-Dry Styler as it protects and adds texture to hair and contains a heat protecting complex to stop your hair getting heat damaged.     Toni & Guy also do a great volumising shampoo (it's just called Toni & Guy Volume Shampoo if you are looking for it) they also do volumising conditioner and sprays.     Remember not to use too much conditioner as this can make your hair look thinner.     As you're trying to grow your hair long you probably won't want to hear this but my hair was always quite thin until I got it cut and know it's a lot thicker and in much better condition!|`|SgKsHxD5aa	embrace what you have =]  i think "stringy" thin hair is beautiful =]  if not, blow dry, but pull your hair up as your blowing it dry.. it volumizes ALOT|`|0d4X54rMaa	try blowing it dry.. that will make your hair feel thicker  use some light hairspray like paul mitchell or sebastian|`|yHWkQs9Paa	Have you ever tried volumizing your hair? These are good products for volume: http://www.herbalessences.com/us/collect...|`|Op6z8nogaa	Well you need it to get thicker :)  Talk to your hairdresser about it and they could cut it a different way.  You could get a shampoo and conditioner that says for fine and brittle hair. Thats what i use because my hair is stringy and has a mind of its own.   good luck.

I used to use a hair for curls and my hair dried curly then i stopped using it and it became less curly. I think it was the switch of shapoos combined with the length of my hair
P49jDxMAaa	That sounds like the best length. It's short enough to be "socially acceptable" like in a sense that its fashionable and yet not completely "skanky."

C5f7KlAtaa	egg facials are great!   my mom and i just tried it the other day.  you crack the egg and put the yoke in a small bowl and mix in a little honey and paint it on your face, let it sit for 10 minutes and then wash it off.  next whip the egg white until its kind of foamy and let that sit on your face until it dries.  it makes your face feel super smooth!|`|AA12284612	that's to help oily skin. try using a sugar with some honey and water to get rid of the blackheads because sugar is a natural scrub.

A couple millimetres is good.|`|GAxHzgEEaa	actually having long nails are kind of atractive.    just make sure you keep them in shape by going to the shop regualrly  and painting them|`|8uUpAKPtaa	it really depends on how long they are..|`|972LCOk4aa	atleast long nails are more attractive than short nails|`|APNzM50Saa	Ewwy I hate long finger nails|`|P9HuD4Qgaa	if it's longer than an inch, then it is unattractive. and the thing that makes it weird, is this one question: How in the Hell, do you wipe ur ***?lol|`|9Ltw4iMuaa	As lond as they arent dirty, and as long as ur a girl.|`|tBPhjpGCaa	anything over half a centimeter i don't like.    i actually love having my nails long and though i don't actually measure mine that's about how long i keep them naturally. anything longer and they get in the way, scratching people or myself.   i also start getting worried about breaking them if they're too long and i hate to be one of those girls who says stupid things like 'shoot! i broke a nail!'
bDolQsPhaa	this is a really good link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdp_UAvA1...    top liner took me forever to get down. so keep trying until you get it!    good luck :))|`|VK3kyzGDaa	I have trouble doing the bottom.    I think top is easier.    Just pull the corner of your eye out. And then apply it.      If you use liquid, it is easier if you just put a whole bunch of little dots along your eyelid then play connect the dots.  :)    Good luck!|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Sorry no link to video, but I can do it well!    Put your index finger in the outer corner of your eye and pull gently so your eye lid forms a straight line, with your other hand push the pencil just above the lash line where the skin starts to curve over and lightly apply the liner until satisfied.   Put your index finger in the middle of your eye lid and gently pull up toward your brow. Your upper lid should slightly fold over. In the inside (by your nose) where your eye forms the corner, lightly run the pencil under the lashes til you get to the other corner of the eye (but don't poke your eye out!!)    Hope you uderstand my directions and best of luck.|`|lkkUh6eeaa	Start outwards bring your line towards the middle of your eyelid then connect it on the inner side. Don't pull your eyelid it's bad. Hope i Helped! :)|`|C3tVKFWuaa	ME 2! lol

zjZvJJLpaa	its hard to say considering different shades of silver look good with different things. The mary janes will probably look best with dark silver or some medium shades. Considering you are going with a neutral color pallet, you may want to stick to a french manicure. Hot pink would only look good if you are going to have a hot pink sash around your waist.|`|U62uLb9yaa	Get the french manicure. stick with silver flats or red heels. they compliment the color the best. or get black heels.|`|Y9OQu7efaa	Go with the french. Pink may draw the attention away from your outfit and to your nails...in this case simple is better. Good Luck! Hope I helped!

That is definitely trendy.     but i would go for traditional rain boots rather than those ones... you know the kinds that are all rubber... those would be much cuter =]|`|jgf6RDPSaa	They'd look totally awesome! Not in the slightest be annoying.|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	Yes, they'd probably look obnoxious. Just wear a nice yellow raincoat to go with it you'd be a Homer Simpson.    Black, Red, Gray looks nice.  Since you have gray boots and black doesn't go with you, I'd take red.|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Well the top part looks kind of funky.  But the actual foot part is cute.|`|UhDPjSz7aa	YESSS ! i think they'd realli brighten up any outfit. i don't think it'll be that weird, i say someone wearing yellow rainboots today as well ! lol
GZKbvXLLaa	It depends on the brand, but usually a good indicator is when it starts to thicken in the bottle, its time to throw it away and get new stuff. People will tell you to use a few drops of polish remover or thinner, and yeah that will work. But at the same time, the polish will lose much of its shine and luster. Best bet is to toss the bottle at that point...|`|fMLBPUVeaa	i always get rid of it when its starting to chip at the top, usually four days after i put it on. don't keep it on so long that it looks bad, and don't keep putting the same color on over and over, or it'll turn your nails that color!! and don't always wear nail polish, leave it off sometimes :) hope that helps.|`|KEC3ezStaa	You should usually change or get rid of your nail polish when they start to get messed up. [Lol] But it's true. If you wanna avoid ugly nails, get rid or change them.|`|alOaBeSXaa	it can start to dry out and go lumpy  but there is a solution, but a bit of nail varnish remover in and it will sort it out  and you should be able to get every last bit out    just be REALLY careful about how much you put in  tiny bits at a time or you'll ruin it|`|WZzgPzECaa	It truly lasts forever. Buy some nail polish thinner from a beauty store to thin it out a bit when it starts to get thick. Never thin it with nail polish remover, though.     There are enough chemicals in nail polish to preserve it. It is not like lipstick. Otherwise, salons wouldn't be able to use a bottle on multiple people.
qOKFuXfLaa	yes, they test on animals|`|GhHhcHZ1aa	not to sure but i wouldn't use cover girl its Too cheap and most likely will make you get zits and what girl wants zits all over their face i know i don't! so i would suggest neoutregena or L'Oreal those are the best(: hope you liked it hit me with a message for any more help on makeup or anything beauty((:
zwMbzJSgaa	like the black ones??    ok here its REALLY easy. and its not like its broken! don't worry..  just put one over the other like a venn diagram.  then with the one thats underneath, just pull that part through the other one and pull the other side together. and at the same time put the one on top down through the other one and pull it with the other side of that one.    confusing much??  if the black bracelets are what you are talking about and you dont understand this than just tell your friend cause its NOT broken :) i always play with mine and undo them and stuff!|`|Xt5NaIwJaa	ok here its REALLY easy. and it is not broke you dont need to worry, just put one over the other like a venn diagram.  then with the one thats underneath, just pull that part through the other one and pull the other side together. and at the same time put the one on top down through the other one and pull it with the other side of that one.

r4xRkqzdaa	hair:  -use a ceramic (not metal plate) straightener and a humidity protection cream/oil  ------ i would get a CHI iron for about $200  -i like layer cuts best    makeup:  -purple is great for brown eyes  -always highlight the brow bone (under the eye brow) and the corner of the eye by the tear duct  -look up contouring nose on youtube to learn how to fix the nose problem  -------good vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZIaQrO8_...    skin:  2 TIMES A DAY- no exceptions!!!!  if you get pimples, make sure to use a medicated soap|`|F8OrjeWsaa	Hair - for best results, blow dry hair straight with a round barrel brush and then straighten it with a hair straightener if you want it straighter, make sure you use heat protecting cream in it.   I'm not sure what your face shape is or anything, but personally, on me, I prefer shoulder - mid length hair with only some layers.     Nails - I keep mine healther by using Dr. Lewinn's Revitanail. It's excellent, it strengthens, makes them glossier and longer. I even have people ask me if my nails are fake - thats how well it works.   For colours I like nudes and browny reds, but keep it natural for school.     Makeup - for brown eyes, green eyeshadow and earthy colours look good but keep it natural looking for your age. I'm not sure about the nose question though, sorry.     Skin - wash your face in the morning and night with an oil-free fash wace. NOT SOAP.|`|uzYHWdgPaa	Hair: pantene straitening system is amazing.  length depends on your face shape, but going off your age, i'd say long with a few layers    Nails:  gelatin is supposed to strengthen nails, and pail pink is pretty for your age and doesn't show chips as easily!    makeup:  very light gold shimmer for night, but not much else for day. your young, so anything heavy will look ridiculous.  As for the nose, do you mean lumpy with blackheads, then try biore pore strips. if it is lumpy by design then just accept it    Skin:  once in the morning and once in the evening. plus moisturizer every day. and a mask one -two times a week.     also drink eight glasses of water a day to improve overall complexion and healthiness!|`|w3feYgkCaa	Hair: Use shampoo that keeps your hair straight, For example Herbal Essence's Straighten Up, and a moisturizing conditioner. Once you get out add a de-frizzing serum like Frizz Eaze to control poofiness. And before you straighten use a heat protectant spray, like Tresemmes Heat Thermal Spray.  I have choppy layers and I love them, you can tease them and add volume easy. But sometimes, They tend to flip out depending on who you are, so get your hair thinned out. Choppy layered hair is also messy, soft and pretty easy to straighten.      Nails : Use a nail strengthening nail polish remover.   Clip your nails once they get past the tip of your finger and cut your cuticles after 2 weeks or more.   Try, A bright turquoise or Magenta Purple. Turquoise balances out with a sunny white female and contrasts with the skin tone, and Magenta purple contrasts off a pale white female.  To go bold, try red or black.    Makeup: Try a bright purple; (It could match your nails) :D, It also contrasts with brown eyes. Use a natural sparkling tan eyeshadow and accent your eyebrows with a white.  You can't use makeup to un lump yout nose, just try patting foundation it lightly      Skin: wash your face twice a day, once in the morning and at night when you get in the shower or before you go to bed.|`|EzSeccrLaa	for straight hair, i like the emo or scene styles    You can buy healthy nail growth stuff that will make your nails stronger. i like purples and blues. pinks can be cool too.    for eyeshadow, use shimmer powder because it won't make it look like your trying too hard (or make you look like a whore)    I wash my face once a day, maybe twice if my skin is really oily that day.
H1NjIT10aa	I would suggest you show it to different stylist and ask would could be done to hide or fix the problem without totally wrecking your style.|`|CAY9zwp8aa	HEADBANDS!|`|UgzaDU8vaa	Try fixing it yourself, using a leg razor.  It's hard to mess it up because you aren't cutting much off.  It won't grab that much hair, but it will make it fixable.    :]
lyp6JEcEaa	I am interested to know what about Bare Escentuals you aren't pleased with. As not all mineral makeup is the same, as not all liquid makeup is the same. One companies can be way different from anothers. I find it funny when people swear by MAC when if you read MAC's ingredients they are very similar to the ingredients in drugstore brands. Here is my observation.....Mainstream, drugstore, makeup counter brands are pretty much the same. The majority of them are loaded with chemicals that can break you out or cause cancers later in life. Many people who never had acne can get it after using these makeup products as they can cause something called "Chemical induced acne". I have used MAC in the past as well as many other brands, they are loaded with fillers and chemicals that can and will break you out. They contain things like Propelyne Glycol (an greasing agent in break fluid) and dimethicone (a silicone based product that puts a film over the skin not allowing it to breathe). If you put a question out about people breaking out from MAC or other brands you will see a huge list. You can check out how chemical laden MAC's or any other brands ingredients are here........http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com .................After doing a lot of searching by ingredients, overall finish, staying power and glow factor, I have found a company I recommend to everyone it is called Faerie Organic Minerals. They are all natural, light, airy, conceal very well, and leave a dewy glow. They are not greasy, oily or cakey as I found bare escentuals to be. They also have a free sample kit to try them out first. I think you will really like them, as they are as pure and flawless as you can get. You can see their site here.........http://www.faerieorganic.com|`|PlA6c1iJaa	maybe it's maybeline....no pun intended...ok maybe|`|5UjkkQgDaa	ask someone at the store... they know a lot they helped me with my eyeshandow and liner :)|`|apALY0sqaa	All I use is MAC!!! I love it!    An artist is the best bet, as they can steer you in the right direction. You can tell them your wants, color-match you, and teach you proper application techniques- which vary on the artist, so there are several. So, I would ask for a master artist if I was you. Or the artisit who's make-up calls to you and your style preferences.    Their Studio-Fix foundation is amazing (liquid)- get a pump, it dispenses the perfect amount with 2 pumps! And their mineral foundation is great over Prep and Prime or over a light layer of liquid foundation.    If you live in San Diego, go to the MAC store in Friar's mall and ask for Nancy (off Mon and Tues)!!! She is FANTASTIC!|`|QDXGzkYoaa	OMG MAC MAKE UP IS THE BEST MAKE UP EVER!!!

w3feYgkCaa	GIRL! You don't need no bronzer! Just don't wear a lot of black, and work eyeliner and cute bright eye shadows. You probably don't even need bronzer, just wear something like a cute fun t-shirt with flare jeans and flip flops and part your hair on the side and add earrings or something.  Trust me, you can't rely on bronzer your whole life, and black hair is soo cute.

LMuJMAqfaa	Not really, it depends much more on their sense of style. Many prefer the brand you include above probably because they are easily put together and become stylish without trying too hard. However, even with cheaper brands, you can pretty much achieve the same. The advantage that those who wear non-mainstream brands have is they wont look the same as other girls. Yes, it is harder to put together and outfit you find from target, but it is very rewarding as well.|`|SIwbZ2ACaa	People judge me because I wear granny clothes!

I actually don't own clothes from any of those stores (hah! ;P) i bet i'm judged, but to those girls i just say screw them :P|`|89aNHoPnaa	No i dont because i dont wear brand names so why should i judge people. Because i know i wouldnt want them to judge me.|`|IfGTdMvAaa	nooo... that's rude. & there are also a lot of other clothes out there that're cute besides hollister/a&f etc. so nope.|`|PNLwOIOraa	those brands suck! they tear easy B{   i do like american eagle pants though. but i usually wear band/movie shirts. O_O|`|R6Z8onywaa	okay, first of all those aren't brand names, they're all for whiny teens (like myself without the whiny .lol.) who cant afford the real stuff. personally when i see someone with abercrombie not plastered across their chest i feel as if they are unique and cooler than someone who does pay for a company to advertise on their body...   personally as a teen girl I say, shop somewhere different, for me its nordstrom, urban outfitters, bendels, bergdorfs, free people, barneys, and bloomies... but be yourself... not an abercrombie zombie|`|pqyBYc4Daa	people do do tht i dont it wrong|`|uFBXM4rIaa	why would i judge them.  i don't know them. i don't judge on clothing brand.  i tend to notice the actual outfit more than the logo plastered on it.|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Nope, I would never judge them.  With brand name clothes, everyone ends up with the same stuff because there's not much variety.  But with clothes from places like thrift stores and such,  You always end up with something no one else has.  It's really great.|`|EyAAFfaMaa	I don't wear those brands, and everyone I know hates those stores. So when I see people wearing it, namely girls, I don't judge, but I think "Why pay to be a billboard?"     But I don't care what people wear, friends are friends.|`|zjZvJJLpaa	Well, I personally judge people if they DO wear those brand names xD. I think that they are all unoriginal preps who are to desperate to be popular, even though the people they are trying to fit in with are either kidding themselves or feel the same way. I did hear a girl in my class say that "they hate it when ugly people wear abercrombie..." this should tell you what kind of people wear those overly priced crap items that are only worth 2 cents... (if that) Sorry if I am offending people here, but its just my oppinion.|`|A9CVjQdAaa	I used to wear all those brand names. (Abercrombie, Hollister, etc.)  But about a year ago I grew out of them.  I just got bored of themm.  When you wear clothes that aren't name brand, you can make your   outfits more fun and make your outfits unique! (:|`|TwXJS1thaa	honest opinion. if they look cute and put together i think "wow! i wonder where she got that" (in a good way) and maybe compliment or ask her. If shee looks sloppy, ill think "eww... did she get that at walmart???" not that walmart is bad, just you wanted mi honest opinion. If i see someone covered inall hco or a+f i think, cute but i wish it was more unique and they didnt look like all the other ppl. NORDSTROMS ROX!!!!!|`|85nPMEC2aa	personally i don't judge girls by the brand they wear..sometimes by there style ..like are they scene, emo, preppy, gangster, athletic, fashionista stuff like that..kinda gets a scents for there personality but i don't judge them|`|J33OCEQaaa	i do not wear clothes from hollister or abercrombie.  i sooooo do not have the money for that. i wear some things from  aeropostale but almost every thing i own is from old navy.  i love that store just cause it has great prices their clothes are my style.  i definately do not judge people who do not wear  brand names. it shows that you don't wanna be like everyone else
6ZL6pKh2aa	nutra nail is awesome.. i used to bite and rip my nails all the time but now i use this.. my nails are longer and stronger than ever! here's what i suggest:    1) file down any jagged edges and make sure all your nails are the same length  2) while watching a movie or something apply it onto your nails and rub it into your cuticles, it'll soak in quickly  3) repeat several times  4) paint your nails a pretty color (this keeps me from biting)|`|AA10030741	I started using nutranail growth treatment for the last few days and I can tell a slight difference, They seem stronger?!
4UY33elFaa	i would highly suggest going to your local beauty school. they are close to free. they are learning but are better then you doing it yourself.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	oh my god dont bother with salons       seriously my mum is an ex hairdresser and when i wanted to bleach the underside of my hair she insisted i go to the salon (but had to pay with my own money, at 16)  it cost 80 and they got it from dark brown to a dark caramel, i wanted bright blonde    my friend   bought 40vol dye for 7   hers went from black to platinum    it didnt fall out   didnt turn green  and saved her a hell of a lot of money      just make sure you bye bleach and not a tint (most blondes on the shelves dont contain peroxide, they are just colours for blondes who want a different tone, make sure you get bleaching dyes) i wouldnt suggest doing highlights alone  also you would need to get one of those rubber caps  as i assume your not a hairdresser who will be able to do highlights on yourself and have them look decent  (its fiddley the way the hairdresers do it)|`|PzbRJrTKaa	yes, just do it yourself.|`|mXMxsC6oaa	i no yu said that you cant afford salons but they will look far much better then a box in my opinion.|`|h3rN7snkaa	Well box dye is really bad for your hair. Especially blonde, because your bleaching it.   Try this:  In the hair dye isles they will have this stuff in a suntan looking bottle, and if you put it on your hair before you go out in the sun it bleaches if more naturally. You can also try pure lemon juice, that works great!  Wear sunscreen!|`|3xhAbMIwaa	I know a couple people that used dye from the box and it came out really well. But i've only gotten highlights a few times and i'm not an expert at hair|`|XxR36ICHaa	I use boxes of it all the time, you can always dye it back (unless it's red as I learned)    Or, you can spend a dollar for a bottle of peroxide, and put it in your hair, then blow dry and repeat until it's the right colour for you!|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	Don't dye it. If you really want to, save up your money and go to a salon to dye it. Or you can ask around your neighbourhood for an experienced hairdresser, or some cheaper salons.    Don't dye it yourself.    I repeat:  Don't dye it yourself.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	i used to use Lightening gel. it works so well. its made by La Bella.|`|87KMkWLuaa	GET A JOB|`|cDpu1Dxyaa	If you can't afford a pricey salon then go to a regular one (they usually have average/discount hairdressers in malls) just PLEASE don't do this at home! It will destroy your hair if you don't use the proper conditioners and do it they way paid professionals are taught.|`|tL2U34kraa	well it depends, hair color from stores in boxes are less expensive but you risk the chance of it looking weird because it doesn't Always look exactly like it does in the box, if you have found a color that works for you and that looks good then  go for another box, also are you sure your hair is healthy a way to test it is to take a small chunk( not a big handful) and tie it in a loose knot if it stays in the knot its not healhty but if it unties right away then its healthy, also a trim may help to get rid of dry ends that are usually common after bleaching.good luck!|`|AhpS6XJnaa	Do not use box colour if you want to go blonde, it is very risky, and don't listen to anyone saying use bleach, it will damage your hair severely! I'm sure wouldn't want burnt,brittle and broken hair now would you!    I know you said you can't afford the salon prices, but it would be best for you...  and your hair if you could save up some money and get someone experienced to dye your hair for you!|`|jIkaapKQaa	You know what, our hair is our best asset.  If you try inventing something that would ultimately ruin your hair, that would be irreversible and you'll regret it forever.    If it's something for the hair and the face, try not to be overly cheap about it because damages can't be reversed.    Try saving money until you can pay for a good dye at a salon.|`|x3istER1aa	bleach hair first if you want it all blonde go to CVS and buy hair dye and read direction how to do it on your own|`|XksFLLiGaa	dilute bleach|`|xKcphGWIaa	Get either FERIA from Loreal, OR Perfect 10  !    Depending on the blonde level u want to reach u might have to use 2 packages, but seriously, i would NOT dye it at home!    with 40 or 50 bucks you would have it dyed professionally and  it lasts longer !|`|qOwKRaMPaa	DO NOT use box  it will turn your hair YELLOW not BLONDE  definately save up for a salon  if not then you are blinding the world with your bad hair  you dont want that do you?|`|Bj8pnKNiaa	I have been dying my own hair for the past 6 years. It really depends on what type of blonde you want to be. If your hair is already light, you can use a box. The directions are simple. You just put the color in the developer, shake until it is all mixed, and apply. Leave it in for around 25-40 minutes. It depends one what type of dye you're using.    If you want to go really blonde, I suggest bleaching. Bleaching isn't all that bad, it just  makes your scalp itch when it is on your head. If you bleach it, you have to mix it with developer, and use heavy duty gloves, because it can irritate or even burn the skin. Just rinse it thoroughly after about 25 minutes of it being in, and be sure to condition your hair with repairing conditioner. This is crucial in keeping your hair intact.    Also, I noticed someone said dont bleach your hair because it will break your hair and stuff. Ive bleached my hair about 6 times, once twice in a row, and my hair is completely fine. If you condition it properly, it should be fine.    As for the boxes, those are what I normally dye my hair with. Sometimes it doesn't come out exactly like the box color, but that is normal, because hair is different for everyone.    If you need more info, just ask. :)|`|eXfmIC68aa	Use Hydrience. I have used it for years and my hair is still soft and silky :-)   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E...|`|Hvo3dlU8aa	I've done both salon and box color (in every shade pretty much) for many years now and this is what I would suggest.     The first rule of box color - always try to stay no more than 2 shades within your CURRENT color.  This is important because if you don't do this you could end up with a color that you simply don't want, and then have to go through the expense of buying yet another box color, and coloring your hair too many times in a row will damage it very quickly.    If your looking to lighten up then do it gradually. You should always wait at least 4 - 5 weeks before you color again (doing this prevents damage and dryness).     Another note: just because you buy the box color doesn't mean you have to use the entire box of color on your hair. I would suggest just using your fingers when gloved and streaking the color through your hair just to blend it a bit.   Also to cover roots use it sparingly and just apply the color over the color that you want to change.   The less color you use - the less damage to hair..    Always remember to CONDITION - this is the number 1 secret to hair coloring both salon and box. All box colors especially the two below come with REALLY impressive conditioners. However I found the Bed Head/ TIGI line of shampoos and conditioners to be some of the most moisturizing, and they are really good for maintaining hair color after your out of the "magic" hair color conditioner.     Below are a few box colors I really liked.     I just started using Perfect 10 by Clairol and I really liked the results, plus my hair did not feel dried out at all - the conditioner that comes with it covers 6 weeks of shampooing. (This retails around $14 - $16)    Revlon's Colorsilk - This line is the most inexpensive of them all, and it still works like a charm. If your looking for the best price - this is the way to go.  ( This retails around $2.50 - $5)    I hope all this helps and good luck!|`|4t7RMhgDaa	i would use a box brand called born blonde,its cheap and works on even the darkest of hair.best box brand to use in my opinion,goodluck;)

Flrnnme1aa	As a professional makeup artist for over 20 years and having worked with this line for 2 years now I can say this:    The Stick is a much thicker foundation so if you are looking for a thicker coat, but this can also be used to spot cover areas and blend in withthe lighter foundation.    The pressed powder can be used alone for a super light coverage or can be used on top of either the liquid minerals or the photo touch to add a hair more coverage or matte alittle more.The Liquid minerals is an awesome everyday any hour foundation that you can always rely on it will give you a medium coverage now if you add their primer that foundation will not budge for 18+ Hours.    The photo Touch is super light,great coverage and it has 2 added benefits the built in brush for easy no mess application and it contains light reflecting spheres so it bounces light away from your face. Great especially for pictures etc.|`|dxWf70Khaa	The pressed powder, liquid minerals and the foundation stick are all the same the only difference is the amount of water added. The Photo Touch is "light reflecting" to aid in better picture quality.
Bj8pnKNiaa	You have to bleach your hair, because the light just mixes with the dark, making it still dark.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	how long ago did you put the red on?    if the red has faded a perminant dark brown would cover it   a medium brown would need a bleaching before it would cover it    try a bleach bath insted of pure bleach  (mix hair bleach with shampoo..)   itl lift it a few shades|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Go to a salon!

That doesn't make a whole lot of sense but whatever, you are always going to have a teensie bit of red in your hair unless you dye it black, but if the color is lighter than your haircolor now then you have to bleach it out first, but don't worry you don't need it to go super blond or anything, just light enough for the brown to stay there.|`|djp7q9mMaa	um is your hair dyed at the hair dresser if not don't worry you can color it as soon as u want but if at the hairdresser you need to ask her because different dyes have different affects.|`|xKcphGWIaa	you have to bleach it first at a hair salon so the brown color or whatever color you want can actually stick to ur hair ! =)|`|dqe30Pciaa	bleach it then color it brown   -hope it helps|`|RwtHiQufaa	well my hair was brown then i went to blonde so maybe try to dye it blone then wait a little while then dye it brown|`|IuTnN5ihaa	yeah wait until it fades out. other wise if u do it now and again your hair might fall out|`|WoltH8VCaa	nopee, i wanted my hair reddish brown and i had brown hair, the red faded out. so im not trying that again. but if you go a dark brown and theres a reddish tone to it itll be so pretty!  and yeah i re-dyed my hair more red after it faded about a day after. feels the same so yea it doesnt matter how soon you dye your hair.|`|blWH1H7Kaa	red is probably the hardest thing to color over  i would get it done professionally   they can take the color you have in right now partially out and color over it|`|0ef832795209d3efd504064202cd3408aa	That red is always going to show through unless you have the color professionally stripped, and then recolored.

It's perfect as a primer, even with my ultra matte eyeshadows, there are no creasing or anything...  And also when I just want my eyes to look awake i use it as eyeshadow, and its great..

NMiICtskaa	EIther way you will have something left over in the hair if you are blonde. Definately go with a TEMPORARY color. dont even use semi permanent because that will last a LONG LONG TIME! Go to sallys or a beauty supply. be sure it says TEMPORARY. Even with blonde hair you may get some staining. If that happens, use a Clarifying treatment, cover with a baggie and use heat from the blowdryer for 15 min then shampoo. It will remove any leftover color|`|akIIIE8saa	i dont think its good to color ur hair at all i tried going darker then lighter then it just went dark and i let it be for a few months and it didnt go back to my original hair color  so i died it lighter and it came out very wierd so i went back to dark so i was just stay a brunette|`|ZUKz3XDvaa	Be careful with "temporary" hair dyes, especially if you've already colour treated your hair.   Most temporary hair dyes don't remove pigment just add it.  If you've never dyed your hair it will wash out, fade away in a certain number of washes.    The reason it's temporary is because the hair follicle is already filled with pigment.  But if you've died you're hair, or had any other type of chemical treatment or even if it's just damaged, that temporary hair dye....not so temporary.  Permanent dyes remove some amount of pigmentation and then add the new colour.  So if you've died your hair a lighter colour, that temporary dye may not come out how you expect.  It won't necessarily go one evenly, or come out evenly, or, in worse case scenarios come out at all.    It depends on your how your hair is naturally, how much pigmentation is left after you've died it, how evenly it's spread, and then what kind of temporary dye you use and how well it's done.    But you're running a risk.  It may not go on properly, you may have patches that won't take more pigments (if that happens, they do make mascara like hair wands, for covering up patches like that), and sometimes, no matter how much you wash, it won't come out, or it will make your colour go wonky.  Sometimes colours wash to different things.  Black often goes green, brown can go any number of things.    There are just too many variables too tell.  It could go off perfectly or be a disaster.  You never really know.    But you're doing it yourself, and if something does go wrong, fixing it on your own can be anywhere from hard to impossible, and if you need to pay to get it fixed, it can be anywhere from costly, to very costly, to you've done permanent damage to your hair and "we can't do anything without risking your hair breaking off."    Of course, it could go perfectly.  But considering the consequences if it doesn't, you should have a better warning then the stuff on the boxes that people ignore anyway.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	I've got dyed blonde hair (naturally dark dirty blonde) and when I put in a "wash out" dye, it only partially washed out.

ZPq1b0craa	you should straighten out your hair and put bangs always makes a girl look much better.  You should wear a skirt with leggings or a nice pair of jeans then go with a bright top but not to sluttish with a sweatshirt that is not to puffy|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	hey i'm going to one on the 6th too!   i'm doing mine in a pony tail b/c our gym (where the dance is held) is really small so it gets really hot having 200 people in there. pony tails (when done right) look good with pretty much everything... maybe put a decorative clip in your hair...? what is your outfit?|`|zjZvJJLpaa	Curly updos are great! For the easiest updo ever, put your hair in a VERY high ponytail with a thin hair tie that matches your hair color. Curl your ponytail into tiny ringlets all over (try and get a friends help with this) then bobbypin loose hairs into place and leave two strips of hair on either side of your face and loosly curly them. Use sparkly barettes or a nice, thin headband to finish it off. That or, just go to a hair salon and ask them to give you an updo.|`|JQCqrpqnaa	Is it a valentines day dance? if so then you should wear either pink or red, possibly sparkly or glittery. valentines day is all about the cute things. if its not then its still always nice to wear something a little more flashy than a normal day. you'll still look school ready but you'll have that extra shine. for your hair, i would try a half up half down ponytail but if you think a ponytail is too casual then try twisting it into a bun. it'll look more like an up-do but still give you some hair to rest on your shoulders so you're feeling empty. also, maybe try some comfy heels. it'll give you class for the dance, but you'll still be comfortable at school.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|JyAUAbsjaa	get a perm|`|LNnRSLdtaa	just like my hair  but i straighten it     so all i can suggest is putting moose in it or curlers|`|ioGCMeAeaa	go to a salon and get some curl activator stuff|`|J6cq8j9jaa	Sounds like my hair to the T!     What I use is "Tresmemme flawless curls" but it only works after you get out of the shower and your hair is still wet. Just put some in your hair and scrunch with fingers then let it air dry... voila perfect curls!!
nhLakq35aa	Ben Nye is a makeup brand that deals with stage and special effects makeup so your best bet is getting it online unless you have a beauty supply store that you know deals with theatre makeup. No drugstore or department store is going to carry it. You can also request a catalog on their main site and you might be able to order it from the catalog but I'm not sure.     http://www.bennye.com/    The price depends on the size but here are some online sites that sell Ben Nye

4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	Not true to the lady's answer below me. I had sex 3 days after I had it done.    1st of all....I have it done horizontally. Its took about 1/8 of a second and it was a small shock not really painful. I have always worn a ring not a barbell. I know lots of girls who have had it done and not had issues with it being ripped out.     As far as an enhanced sexual feeling. No. None. Not any different at all. This piercing healed in just a few days too. I was expecting weeks of recovery time. And I can take the ring out for months and months and have no problem getting it back in. I had it out for 2 years once and put a ring back in no problem.     1. It never gets snagged.   2. I prefer the ring. Its prettier  3. I have a horizontal and have no info on the vertical  4. It took a few days to heal and I cleaned it with plain soap and water in the shower.   5. You can totally have sex with it. 1st day or 2 its kind of sore and a little swollen, but if its done professionally and correctly one shouldn't have any issues.     I've had mine for almost 10 years now. It still rocks.|`|c5anDswjaa	I got a vertical one done about 2 years ago.. I love it! Sometimes it is a little uncomfortable, not painful, I like to compare it to guys having to adjust their balls lol..  I havent ever had it snagged on anything, I still have the CBR in from when they pierced it.. So Ive yet to put a barbell in and see what thats like..    Mine didnt hurt at all, however my friend said hers hurt pretty bad.. I dont quite remember how long it took to heal, maybe a few weeks? Technically, you COULD have sex when you get it done, but I wouldnt.. All that bumping and grinding will irritate it and make it take longer to heal|`|PFBKuVhBaa	ahhhhhhhhhhh!  ouch  i can only imagine  interesting tho   :D|`|EFz2Y9jZaa	You can't have sex for at least 6 weeks after you get it done. If you have sex before then it can get ripped out.    Its a potentially dangerous piercing, it can kill all the feeling down there, do you really want that?|`|AA12087111	OK I'll tell you what I know. (7 more wks til I'm a licensed piercer) anyways basically all piercings as far as pain goes vary from person to person, but really it's just a little pinch and fast if done right. You CAN have sex once you get it done but make sure to clean it w/ SEA SALT and WATER or (H2ocean solution) basically the same to keep it from getting infected. It takes 6-8 weeks to heal. IF you get the CBR (HCH) it's just for looks it does nothing to stimulate you. The Barbell (VCH) is what is used for stimulation and it has been known to work. It may be a bit sore from swelling and bleed a little but that shouldn't last long. SO basically it's stimulation (vch) vs looks (hch) to determine which is better!
8THz1sp9aa	how long is the poem? lettering always looks good on the inner wrist, but if it's a longer poem i would get it on your side (rib cage area.) all tattoo's are going to hurt, so there's no getting away from that. everyone takes pain differently, so you are just going to have to get it and see for yourself how painful it really is. it is definitely bareable i can tell you that much. and if it means that much to you, you will deal with the pain. good luck.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	How many words in the poem?  They have to be a certain size to be readable, and look decent.  Ask your artist, they are really good at advising you on stuff like that.

Or if you wouldnt like that, you could probably put on some dark makeup on the side of your nose to make it look narrower maybe. I dont know, Im no expert and makeup. XD|`|U1FI2Adraa	B easy.  You should definitely start on your health.  That should always b a priority whether your nose is big or not.  Next start saving for a nose job.  But don't do it with out allot of serious research about the doctors.  Take your time.  Don't rush or get impatient. Your young and if you want to really change these feeling you can and will.  Don't give in to feelings that are slowing you down.  Motivate your self to lose wait, save money and get that nose job.  P.S. you can hopefully convince your family to help you finance this by starting a new positive and helpful attitude,  making them buy into the idea that this is something that is already making you feel better just by working toward it.
Kcc0gFi2aa	i have the same problem you do hun...my hair is greasy every single day and i have to wash it and style it every day!    i understand how annoying it is    what you can do is if you want to keep it from looking greasy, put some baby powder in your hands then rub a little bit at a time really good into your roots    the baby powder will cover up the greasiness    also you could even tease your hair into a little one of those "bumps" and bobby pin it then use some hairspray to keep it from falling into your face    hairspray also can suck up the greasiness    im a hairstylist so if you have any other questions about haircolor, haircuts, just hair, makeup, skin, nails, etc. just ask =]      |`|xv5H4scEaa	I have the same problem and i found that washing it every other day kept it from getting as greasy. sometimes the greasiness can actually be shampoo or conditioner left over so make sure you rinse well.|`|d3eU3XQSaa	You probably are using a bad shampoo try using a different one. I'd ask a hair dresser what products are good for your type of hair. Hope you find a good answer:)|`|9iXGakohaa	Because you wash your hair everyday it continues to replenish the natural oils on your scalp at the maximum rate. I know it feels gross but next time you have a weekend to yourself don't wash your hair! Wash your face if you need to but pin your bangs back and let it be greasy. Try to start a habit of not washing your hair as often and it should help.    Another thing that could be causing grease it too much conditioner. Try to stop conditioning. If you can't, only condition your ends. Putting any on your scalp will only encourage oily-ness. They also sell shampoo/conditioner for oily hair so you might want to look into that as well.    Good luck!|`|GAxHzgEEaa	well do you put any grease or hair products in it at all?  that may be the problem.  maybe you should stop.  your hair might not be the type to hold all that grease in.  maybe your hair should be flat ironed every week  and i heard that putting baby powder in it helps  i know it sounds weird?  you should try and experiment different hair shampoos  but i personally think you should wash it every other day or every other two days.  what ever works for your hair.  but make sure to rinse out your hair really good because it might be the soap still in your hair|`|cwsYM2F4aa	I know a little trick because I have the same problem.  If your bangs look greasy, it makes your whole head look greasy.  On the days you don't wash your hair, pull your hair back in a ponytail, leaving the bangs out.  Then wash your bangs in the sink, and blowdry them.  Then style your hair as usual.  For some reason, this will make all of your hair look less greasy.  Hope this helps.|`|lzYRDU1aaa	Use this shampoo and conditioner.  http://www.herbalessences.ca/en_CA/colle...   (it smells amazing by the way)  and after, blow-dry your hair, and your roots.    My friend had the exact same hair as you, then I told her maybe she could blow-dry her hair. Ever since she's never had greasy hair. She also told me she uses that shampoo.   So I bought some of the shampoo myself :)|`|AA10702882	It's actually not 'bad' to wash your hair on a day-to-day basis, but some people's hair dries out if washed daily. Keep on keepin' on. However, your habits may be counterintuitive. For instance, If you use conditioner, you may consider stopping. If you have long hair, then just apply below the neck.   You can also try baby powder.|`|AA11574978	I use this product called crystal clarifying treatment (a cheap Malibu).

It may sound crazy but works wonders.    If you dont want to do this little oil removing sheets, clearisol has them and there little blue strips about the size of credit card, those work as well.|`|4SQx8smEaa	When you wash your hair apply the shampoo to close to your roots, do not put it on you ends, it will dry them out much faster, and when you condition your hair only do the ends, do not use it close to your roots, it will make you hair get greasy faster.|`|0ef832795209d3efd504064202cd3408aa	Try changing shampoos!  Try a daily clairifying shampoo and see if that helps. Sometimes a dandruff shampoo helps ( even tho you don't have dandruff) Be very careful with how much conditioner you use also. That sometimes makes your hair look greasy really quick.|`|MfOjOIhraa	don't use shampoo for dry hair that will really make it oily. if you don't use shampoo for dry hair, i use stuff that you spray in your hair and it keeps it from looking oily its called PSSST! i get it at Walgreen's|`|zXcR3Tgoaa	There is all kind of hair types. Dry, flakey, oily, and many types more. I dont know but maybe you have oily hair? Oily hair is most often the result of over-active sebaceous glands in the follicle pores. Sebum (hair oil) is there for a reason - to help coat, protect and nourish. They generally are increasingly active during warmer weather and can be irritated, inflammed and clogged without proper cleansing.A few tips is, stop using a lot of conditioner. Conditioner can make it really oily. So don't use it a lot. There isn't an exact shampoo that helps every person. Try shampoo for damaged hair. It's easier on it and might help. But you might have to do some experimenting. You know that travel shampoo? The little bottles that they sell in places like Target. Buy some of those. You won't be wasting a lot of $ on them and you can try a lot more different brands. Head and shoulder maybe? I use that. But your hair is always going to be oily. But Washing it twice every morning has always helped me. Because than it has that really soft and frizzy (pretty frizzy) look. And kinda poofs out a bit so it doesn't look so flat and thin. It won't ruin your hair or make it oilier. If you have naturally oily hair it's perfectly fine to wash it twice every day. If your hair is like mine it will look nicer when you wash it 2 everyday. Really thin and oily hair is a curse, right? But you just have to work with it........  you can use though:dandruff shampoo. it dries the a somewhat, but it also has great conditioning benefits. try head and shoulders for oily hair. i wish i had that problem, my hair always looks dried out even at its healthiest. or even apple cider vinigar. 1 tbs to a liter of water and rinse with it everyday
cwsYM2F4aa	Try hot rollers.  Do them first thing when you're getting ready and leave them in while you dress, put on your makeup, etc.  The longer you leave them in, the more the curl will hold.  When you take them out, style the curls a little bit with your fingers and then spray your whole head with a really strong hair spray.  I recommend Aussie Instant Freeze.  That stuff really works.|`|WrmeB8zEaa	You can get special hair products that help it curl. You could also blow dry it while it's in rollers and then perfect the curl with a curling iron and if you get a good curl hairspray it so it will stay in all night  =)|`|6Dec7NFPaa	Hot Rollers|`|zxvovv6Faa	My hair doesn't hold curls if i use a curling iron, so i started using my straightner.  Instead of going straight down with the straightner twist it, I hope that makes sense.  I don't know why but my hair holds without any hairspray when i use my straightner.  It's great!
10JuV3MUaa	First off, that is not a good Hygiene plan. You have to bathe at least once a day.     1.Dial Antibacterial body wash is long lasting and wont dry your skin out  2.Aveeno body lotion is the best - use it all over and you will like taking a shower  3.Tea Tree by Paul Mitchell is the best Shampoo on the planet an leaves you refreshed|`|oQxmkVGhaa	gross. none, just shower!|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	I've never heard of "long lasting" body wash, deodorant or shampoo.  These products are made to be used for a period of approximately 24 hours and then be washed off and reapplied.  There is nothing that is going to keep you smelling fresh for a week not to mention all of the germs and natural bacterias your body naturally produces and will be on your skin and hair.    I would suggest that you shower at least every other day at the very least.|`|gvgFfPwQaa	Why do you hate showering? that' s kinda weird.. sorry.. but it is.. but you can probably try any antibacterial body wash and use a shampoo for oily hair (clarifying shampoo) and then use a dry shampoo in between washings. Use a spray deodorant everyday instead of the roll on kind|`|KNTSXHC4aa	Shampoo - Pert (or just use a dry shampoo like Ojon or some cheap brand)    Bodywash - Dr. Bronner's.... there's a reason hippies love it (myself included)    Deodorant - Adidas    Dude, I hope you at least wipe down yourself or something. Get some baby wipes.|`|YX93lq4daa	Dr. Bronners castile soap as a bodywash lasts a long time, since you only have to use a small amount. It can also be used as a shampoo. Just make sure you use a small amount to know how your hair reacts to it first. If you are use to using shampoo with tons of chemicals, you may have a kind of funky result in the beginning. If your hair is fine after that you could get an organic shampoo bar, you can use that on your body and hair. As far as deodorant goes you can make your own. It is a lot better then using those chemical filled products sold at the store.|`|ishRTmt0aa	OMG EWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just take a shower!!!!! theyre not that bad unless your like 5 years old. thats just really really weird if you ask me. just take a shower everyday even if its only like a 2 min one. at least wipe yourself down with those baby butt wiping things!!!!!! just take a shower like a normal person and maybe u wouldnt smell and be so gross!! a good long lasting deoderant would be certain dri altho im warning you it itches real bad after you put it on.|`|OTrQxlNEaa	I use tresemme, and for deodorants i use secret (daily) and for bodywash, i use olay the pink bottle it smells soo good and makes your skin really soft and smells amazing!!!  Good luck!!|`|QRLbF63daa	you're disgusting take a shower once a day like a normal person. you're gross and you smell|`|Ih4T0QpOaa	herbal essence body wash and shampoo.    for deodorant, use Lady Speed Stick.    Really?  You don't shower everyday!?  I'll freak out if I don't! : )|`|94KnUvDIaa	body wash - neutrogena body wash (the orange one)  -- it helps get rid of body acne... but because it does that means that it really gets in there and washes out the dirt and oil pretty darn good    deodorants - clinical strength  -- it is really really strong... and you put it on at night and it works for the whole next day    shampoo - head and shoulders ... original  -- keep it simple.  you don't want something with a lot of moisturizers because if you dont wash more than once a week your hair can get really greasy. but head and shoulders will keep it from getting too dry, and it wont over moisturize...    hope i helped...   but maybe you should shower more often... that would solve everything.
4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	You want pain??? Get an Industrial. It hurts like hell! And its not a piercing that goes fast. Its two piercings to be exact. The first piercing isn't too bad....but the second one...through the thicker part of the cartilage....oh my lord. It took about 8 seconds of shoving and jabbing to get the hollow needle through. It was horrible!! The worst pain I can remember.     I was told it would be 6weeks or so til it was healed. Try 5 months. I used everything. I was told to use hydrogen peroxide. I did that forever to no avail. I was told later by someone who had a gazillion piercings to try neosporin, bactine, and alcohol. I think it was the spray bactine that did the trick.     Outside of the pain and the lengthy recovery? Its the COOLEST piercing I've had. I get compliments on it everyday. I really wanna ge my other ear done, but Im scared!!! Im a total sissy!     Long story short? Its worth it. But don't let anyone tell you it doesn't hurt.|`|XkJfs2l9aa	its a little worse, but definitely tolerable!   and they look awesome :)|`|rS7fh6pRaa	Its going to be fine, you can tolerate it!

I didn't hurt at all when I got it done really, but you have to be really careful when you brush your hair or change your shirt b/c it really hurts when you knock into it.  From what I guess though - it hurts way less than a lip.|`|QRLbF63daa	you'll look dumb|`|lFPsPzxzaa	i'd say about the same|`|JQCqrpqnaa	i have 7 different piercings on my ears but not an industrial yet. although, my friend just recently got one. last week i think it was. he said it was painful the first day. lots of swelling and puss. ew. but it's gone down now. they put a really big bar in first and then they give you a small one for when the swelling goes down. he said it really only hurt the first few days and now its like nothing. good luck. hope i helped.
0ef832795209d3efd504064202cd3408aa	Try coloriing your hair when it's just a bit damp. Dampen your hair, towel dry, THEN color.  For whatever reason, i"ve found that coloring any type of "red" takes much better when your hair is a bit damp, rather than dry.. Other than that, use a colorfast shampoo, and maybe a "red" highlight spray or colorgloss after you shampoo. It's worked for me!.|`|SgG2m5zNaa	maybe try radiant red shampoo and conditioner|`|vrHwx5dsaa	i havent found anything that works yet.  my hair is naturally red but i make it more burgandy,  i have to do it about every 2 months.  i'll be curious to see your answers:)

She also has physical differences like brown hair etc. She is really just like Claire though, if you think about it. I know this is cliched, but she really is super insecure.

fYox2mwGaa	1) The hole appears after a while because you've worn down the top layers.  There is a thin stick in the middle of the chapstick.  It's all part of the mechanism that helps the chapstick move up and down.  You'll see what I'm talking about after you've completely used up a tube....     2) Use chapstick as you need to.  No one would think you're wasting it when you're putting it to good use.  Better to have nice healthy soft lips than to have dry cracked peeling bleeding lips!!|`|KbUIttmqaa	3 months is not at all wasteful, its actually quite a long time to finish a single tube of chapstick.     and a chapstick that lasts for a while (more than an hour usually) is burts bees. i use it and i havent had chapped lips in like a year.|`|GAxHzgEEaa	A) after you use it for a while it wears down and theres a thin stick in the middle that holds it in place.   &    QUATRO) I usually use mine in about a month  so your not wasteful. your actually conservative.  some peoples lips just get dry faster|`|eJdWHgyjaa	i have the same problem but ten times worse. i use like 5-10 in 3 months and i use softlips and nivea moisture and it does the trick for me .|`|mU6Owbhoaa	1) i don't know why a hole appears     2) i normally use mine up in just a couple of weeks, so your not using it too much, or at least i think your not.

But first i searched all over the net for another alternative... and came across this site      http://ptosotab.com/         Now because i don't believe everything i see over the net i searched about this site and came over this site http://eyelidptosis-options.com/    Making it look pretty reliable... anyway the price isn't bad for what it's supposed to do (you have an option of 3 different most trusted products, all free shipping and money back guaranteed)    I am going to order the one from ptosoab hoping it'll work... i'm not guaranteeing you anything btw i'm just saying that it's something to try.

Most thrift stores are local and not chains so i can't name any with out knowing where you are. Around the buffalo area we have one called Plato's closet that sells lightly used designer clothes but i'm not sure if its in your area. ~K8|`|zjZvJJLpaa	walmart is crap. Targets good, but doesn't have a big selection. Forever 21 and Wet Seal have good jeans, and so does Anchor Blue at times. WetSeal has random sales and things get marked down a lot.|`|GxbXseoqaa	TJ Max or Marshalls or something! Alot of their jeans come from American Eagle, Guess, and other expensive jean stores, but are marked like 70% off!|`|eNKyRGXDaa	Ebay, ross, target.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	Old navy, Macy's, Target, Walmart, Burlington coat factory, Charlotte Russe, American eagle, Ross or Goodwill.

They've also been having sales at a lot of their stores on the jeans rack on sale for $15. They are good quality and last awhile.

(:|`|hEvGrN71aa	If it has to be a store and not online I would say Ross!! That store is AMAZING!     Online at www.alloy.com they have truck jeans, they run about 34-45 depending and they last a REALLY long time I have 2 pairs that I have had for over 2 years and they are just now starting to wear out and I wear them constantly! They have flares, boot cut and skinny jeans!     Hope this helps!|`|r3VaOK4iaa	pacsun :] luv their jeans|`|k24ulNX0aa	I like Old Navy for jeans, or maybe a Gap outlet. Outlets usually have great prices on jeans and stuff.
AA11910088	Half Bra Plz=))|`|APNzM50Saa	try looking for a deep plunge strapless bra or even like those weird cup things, idk how to explain them, I saw them at walmart.|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	if you look, you can actually buy deep v bras.  this is what they look like--> http://www.thisnext.com/item/3BCC7715/3C...  good luck and have fun!|`|24cUKZDgaa	you should but a strapless , or get invisible wire.  Because the bra wire would look messed up  with the cross straps at the back .|`|bDolQsPhaa	http://www.barenecessities.com/Fashion-F...    this item works really well for dances, it adheres to your body, so its not uncomfortable to dance and you dont have to constantly pull up your bra.    this specific link is expensive, but macy's itself should have a great alternative in the lingerie department.|`|unVzWzCuaa	no bra or a clear strapped low bra maybe|`|9lx645Asaa	I BEEN IN THIS SITUATION AND GUESS WAT I DID........................................  ........................I DID NOT WEAR A BRA AT ALL  YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR A BRA UNDER THOES KINDA DRESSES  THATS WHY IT HAS A TIGHT BELT BELLOW THE BOOB AREA   TO MAINTAIN YOUR BREAST  IT WORKED OUT FOR ME  IM SURE YOU'LL BE FINE
W7UpXXQGaa	every one has their own perception of pretty may be the girls you consider not so pretty think there pretty the way they are|`|luwBPdE8aa	Girls do not "were" make-up.  They wear it.|`|MXpW48lFaa	Because even if us 'not so pretty' girls did wear make-up, wat's the point. Comparing us to those pretty girls, it's just a waste of time and effort.|`|MksOlZaVaa	Maybe the pretty girls are only pretty because of the makeup.. Think about that..      But seriously, there are plenty of pretty girls who DON'T WEAR MAKEUP.|`|bSxEfkZQaa	So many things are wrong with this question.     A girl doesn't have to wear make up, it's better for your skin if you don't. Plus, every girl is beautiful in different ways.|`|APNzM50Saa	Because that's why the pretty girls are pretty and the ugly girls are ugly.|`|j5mteNnjaa	umm thats kind of rude because people always tell em i am pretty and everything but i wear absolutely no make up just maybe clear mascara and lipgloss at the most. I hoep your not calling me ugly|`|rrMYRLpXaa	It's their choice, and their choice alone. Leave yourself out of their lives.|`|TrkI5gWbaa	Fix ur grammer, it's WEAR     Well have you ever seen a pretty girl without make up on? Even if it's just light make up? Maybe when you do you'll decide that they aren't so pretty at all.|`|WOBAN2iqaa	I think im "not ugly" and i wear make up nearly everyday. Did you know 80% of women say make up is an essential rather than a luxury? Yeah. Read that in Cosmo. But i like to wear it as much as i like to shave my hairy parts and paint my nails. Thats y we r pretty!!! you have to put some effort in. Not all pretty girls wake up gorgeous, it takes time to get ready for the day.|`|oTiTwGmdaa	i agree with you completey. I mean when girls who are already pretty wear make the kind of look like a manican with all that foundation, bronzer, and super thick eyeliner and mascara. I think its OK for all girls both pretty and not so pretty to wear light makeup.|`|DbdsOblQaa	It might be laziness. I was reading this book and i really agree. It said something like "females who dont wear make-up are just lazy" ( i guess its trying to say that they're not beautiful just because they dont wear make-up ..lol) idk pretty interesting book though. lots of cool pictures. The title was something like Postcards...lol|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Well maybe because they don't have confidence such as the "pretty girls" do and I'm sure everybody has a different reason...this is a dumb question...|`|HvxKb4gIaa	i've seen seen a girl that wears "natural make up" who i thought was gorgeouuus. then i saw her without it... she looked pale, she barely had eyebrows, she didn't have nice skin her lips had no color, etc. and i've seen a whoooole lot of pretty girls that don't wear makeup.    beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but i don't think you should lump every girl together.|`|ekF4YVMiaa	The reason of this is because the "prettty" girl make themselves pretty by putting on make-up.    The "not so pretty" girls feel they dont need to waste their time.     And if a girl is pretty, she would want to make herself more prettier anyways...    :)|`|LMuJMAqfaa	ahhh, the chicken and the egg question ... so is it the pretty ones wear make up or is it the ones wear make up become pretty?|`|50Ia20yXaa	i actually dont agree with what you said because i know alot of not so pretty girls who put makeup on and vice versa. i put makeup on but only enough to keep my skin color in tact. everyone always is surprised to find out i wear makeup. however. i do get your point as well. im not sure why. maybe they just dont care about their looks|`|eHUfVlY5aa	Well.. I'm probably just throwing this out there.. but the pretty girls probably feel a lot more confident changing things about themselves, to make them look even better. the not-so-pretty ones probably feel their in the shadows, and they probably don't care, because they think no one notices them. But I am honestly and truthfully saying that almost every girl out there could be absolutely gorgeous with just a little touch-ups :)|`|AA12224190	I know what you are talking about my mom says exacly what u are saying and yes the ugly girls should were make up and the pretty girls not so much
654d5146948b9a667ab1e0b36ce93e3eaa	when you blow dry your bangs point the blowdryer straight down so it follows the hair -  try not to twirl the brush round as your blowdrying - a hair straightener would get it straight as im assuming you dont want it to curl under - if you dont have a straightener grab you iron and ironing board put a towel over your hair and just really quickly iron it flat..    hope this helps|`|QCrEXyonaa	get a comb with the teeth spaced really close together, like a part comb or something, and use that with a regular brush. keep on combing it down.  If you can, let your bangs air dry after you comb them with your part comb. it'll look better.  also, try getting a straightener, this might help  best of luck :P  ~~~Via~~~|`|EY0wnkh3aa	keep the brush out
k24ulNX0aa	I would go for the second dress with the red clutch and black t-strap shoes (those are very 20s. Think dance shoes but more fashionable). For the pearl necklace, you can get (fake) pearl necklaces at stores like Forever21 or Charlotte Russe for 10 dollars, and they'll be the kind you can wrap around several times.    As for hair accessories, it depends on your hair length, but a pretty, decorative pin would probably work. Something with pearls in it :).    Suggestion for shoes: http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3011983/0~23...|`|oOFeoP5raa	omg! i love that idea! i would go w/ the second dress and shoes like Katy Perry wears in the Thinking of You video.. watch it :)|`|zYdi5UeIaa	shoes and the seconde dress the best but i like all|`|wSMYGzrQaa	i would go with the first dress, a red purse, and either those shoes or a pair of strappy dark blue or silver heels|`|50Ia20yXaa	i think its super classy except i recommend changing the shoes cause they will kinda stand more out then the dress. recommend just black heels. the purse is nice but it looks too nice to take with you there
1620f8acd8e6a1bab16fb6d4bd625f7baa	You have to be at least 16 to apply.   There are no requirements other than that, although you have a better chance of getting a job there if you know about current bands that are popular right now in the scene, and have that scene/emo-ish look.   I have a friend who works there, and he says it's pretty awesome and really fun. (although I suspect he got the job only because he's good-looking LOL)|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	sorry but i hate that store i don't get how people can work or shop there. Im a 13 year old girl and kind of a prep so i feel very out of place of my friends drag me in there. That store like scares me. I will take my coach shoes and uggs over converse any day.|`|xWOL0vWEaa	Well my best friend worked there. She said you had to be at regular ages 18,19,20,21 and above. Tatoo peircings and what not are fine but not to much. My best friend said it was agreat job but at where we lived hardly kids go there. But i dont give a funk because those lil stupid teens can go suck it.  Well jsut wear like skinny jeans anything nice that is like black and what not|`|IF2nOOPqaa	Well i worked at spencers and i had friends at hot topic and they dont exactly look 4 the pierced ppl just people that can bring something new to the store.  they do look for originality though and i believe u have 2 b at least 18 to work there since they sell piercings and junk.
z3uUtr33aa	i'm guessing you have no printer and brown hair, other wise you need to let us know ahead of time. here's a style i like: http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o129/...    it's cute, easy to style and the girl looks like an average teen that just wanted "emo" hair, no biggy. you could say i'd like side swept bangs and choppy short layers on the top only. good luck hun!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	It's sad how you refer to it as "emo girl hair."  Whatever happened to originality?  Just search on google what you're looking for.. most people I see with hair cuts like that have a lot of layers.     I think it looks ridiculous, but whatever floats your boat.|`|swiZhUN7aa	sorry.............. emo died at the end of 2008|`|GAxHzgEEaa	http://www.hairscene.net//wp-content/plu...    http://www.hairscene.net//wp-content/plu...|`|dUHq4B4qaa	"Emo" never existed.  Emo is a type of music that has been misconstrued into some trend or fad.  Use a better word and you might get better answers.|`|VegwUJiCaa	emo wannabe|`|ieOJI6fhaa	ewww why would u want emo hair///......|`|eHUfVlY5aa	There are so many different types of "emo/scene" hair. I think the biggest factor in making your hair look "emo" (i'm not really fond of using the word emo, haha just because many have said i have emo hair) is making the back layer (your "crown") have very short layers. Another thing that helps is either using good quality volumizing hair product there, and/or ratting it with a comb to get that extra poof. And bangs are a neccesity.|`|SiGVPuFmaa	http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0xxlBtFiUBo/R0...  http://i289.photobucket.com/albums/ll220...  http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2189/2366...    *Tell the stylist you want side swept bangs and choppy layers*    The key to 'scene/emo' hair is having it well straightened. After that all you have to do is back comb the roots and use a little hairspray.    hope it works out, peace
dbKj55akaa	Where what you would like, as long as you feel good thats what is important. Unless you wear something skimpy like a thong bottom, but I dont think you will. Board shorts are cool. I used to wear them, still do. Some times you just dont want to show your but off. Bikinis arent made for super skinny people but for everyone. So where what you think is cute.|`|FJIgKzzKaa	dont do board  shorts because then people think that you are really self consious.    try a bathing suit with a triangle top and then like little booty shorts it will distract the attention from you thighs|`|qXCgeye3aa	start running. thighs hate a good jog/run.|`|KMy4b77naa	board shorts are fine, but only if they are cut short, otherwise they look like boy's trunks. wild patterns will distract from any problem areas. links below.    http://www.swell.com/Girls-Boardshorts/B...    http://www.swell.com/Girls-Boardshorts/R...    http://www.swell.com/Girls-Boardshorts/R...    http://www.swell.com/Girls-Boardshorts/R...    remember to buy bikini tops that match any pattern of board shorts you may buy. you don't want to look tacky.    good luck! =D|`|XywHOzKCaa	Honey, i suggest trying to exercise more, and eating healthier. Get yourself down to 106. After that, try wearing a tankini!!    Good Luck hun!|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I have the same kind of body. If you have a generally flat stomach what would look cute is a bikini with womans swim shorts, that's what I wear :)|`|DsgGSkRcaa	go to pac sun they have nice board shorts   try zumiess too
PTK2x59Kaa	YES you can shower that night wake up really late eat put hair any pony tali pull on the hoodie and out the door you go!  also you test better when you are comfortable|`|3sCrTA1Raa	shure  why not  if it makes  you feel comfortable  for the test|`|O0S189PQaa	do it.|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	haha if that makes you more comfortable during the test, go for it!|`|E4pXTZ5Naa	Oh yeah, sure. How classy.....not.|`|a345d4c25e6c992f96ca13e532e7b002aa	don't wear it.  if you dress like you are going to bed then you will feel like it too and you probably won't be as awake during the test.  it is better to be comfortable in clothes that are actually meant for the day time.|`|3G3ncBQGaa	ew no i hate it when people do that! sorry.  but try to dress alittle bit more.....classier.|`|MgVsnEKvaa	sure?|`|oPdR3FHkaa	so cute, i would|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Ha, testing week for me too! :O I wore sweats for all the days, a lot of other girls and guys were wearing them too, no one cares, we're all tired :P|`|ohj5sRpsaa	I think it's a disgusting high school habit that should have never been "cool."     PJ pants should be worn to bed - what are you going to go on the bus and then to school and then back into your bed ?    Great way to sleep with all those nasty bugs!    If you really must do it, fine. At least don't pair it with Ugg boots.
1bZgTD8Haa	Dry brushing is great for lymph circulation! You don't need to do it hard, use whatever pressure feels good for you. The way I do it is to brush towards the center of the body. For example, holding my arm up I brush towards my heart. If you can lay down to do your legs then, again, brush towards your heart. When I brush my trunk I go towards my gut. Drink a glass of water when you are finished to help flush the toxins.    Your body and skin will be so happy!
XxXYw6jIaa	YES..the blue in the water in the bed spreads will go really well with the walls|`|eHUfVlY5aa	i love how you added you're in 7th grade. haha|`|oTiTwGmdaa	the bed spread is ugly.|`|qPIsxtPDaa	not really. it'd be fine but its deffiantly up 2 u!!:D|`|PxMNxytjaa	It would be alright (:|`|qzkWahFeaa	Probably would. Get a paint swatch, and bring it to the store to see if it would look decent.
7rD3uJzdaa	There is a product called Skin id, it is an acne cream that is way cheaper than all the other products and all the reviews i read about the product were amazing?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well where do I start:    You can buy Mederma (which I heard works the best, it ranges from 11-24.00 dollars)  Neutrogena Acne Scar Fading Peel (I heard it works great as well and I think it is about 15 dollars or more at Walmart, but it is for post-acne so first see if you have that)  Or you can use Vitamin e oil capsules (you can get these anywhere for under 10 dollars, do not get the liquid get the capsules because the liquid looses it value over time, you also don't take the capsule *you can if you want to get other areas* orally, you poke it with a needle and apply it to the area.  Lemon juice (I heard this works wonders and its cheap, just get a fresh lemon, squeeze the juice, and apply to the area for 15 minutes with a cotton ball and wash off *I heard it may cause irritation* or you can just any hydroxy acids)  Baking soda and water (This is by far one of the cheapest, make a paste rub it in your hands and rub all over your face, let sit for 10 minutes and wash off *make sure you wash your face off with a mild soap before using this*, the acid in this removes layers of dead skin from your face, the same as the lemon juice)    Good Luck|`|6a60fc76b51aaef7e6e9051ad2ad4d85aa	vitamin E cream does wonders :)  and if your going to wear make up, wear mineral based as it doesn't clog pores and helps healing
IfGTdMvAaa	it can be. if you have mascara on, & you rub your eyes, the mascara can be transferred into your eyes, which can cause infection. so just be careful not to rub your eyes alot.|`|wvN4HLhLaa	It might be.Either it gets in ur eyes or your allergic to that brand. Maybe try a different brand like Covergirl or MAC...|`|yFL2aHi3aa	you're only supposed to keep mascaras for up to 3 months...germs collect in it so yeah definitely throw it out and get another! love covergirl! :)|`|MONbNUmkaa	get something that's gentle like almay or physicians formula and try that for a month or so and see if you notice a difference
KDrztUEpaa	Yeah, you have nice eyes. They're not your best quality, but they're nice.     : )|`|E8qMrpA7aa	ya but mine are better...lol jk :) ya theyre cute :)|`|KbUIttmqaa	yes, and i think the shape of your face is quite pretty|`|S71DKpQCaa	oh you have SEXY eyes|`|LNFsii3Haa	stop plucking your eyebrows! they make your eyes look smaller|`|wvN4HLhLaa	yessss!!!  Dolly eyes =D|`|Mg6fSXfOaa	No, they do seem quite average.  And you plucked your eyebrows too much in my opinion. sorry...|`|MONbNUmkaa	yes, you've got great eyes.  you have plucked those eyebrows to severely though|`|GQ7eWcWXaa	They look like normal eyes, nothing great really, they are still pretty though. Not your best feature. You are very cute:) You should stop pluckinh your eyebrows thought! My pesonal opinion, not to be rude.|`|UfPVZbRxaa	there nothing great they look average|`|sK9kDAtLaa	they r ok|`|GOKNG35daa	No they seem average!! to me that is;[
cXRRP6ttaa	they're both similar cuts but go w/1 even tho i like LC.  i think they may have teased her hair a little on top to give it more volume. i think the haircut will look great on u.   add highlights if u can to embellish it more.|`|DF49SpO9aa	First one, your a doll =)|`|1Gv7Dtoxaa	the first one! and by the way your hot|`|cYcuSINgaa	first one|`|ahci6qGUaa	your cute!|`|IOgVthDHaa	.....

It was today in UTAH|`|ybobzisDaa	Umm, they both look about the same.|`|5vbWDqjNaa	The cut looks the same to me|`|TyQVTvw1aa	I don't like Jessica but she has cute hair........I vote for that......also you have prettier eyes than either of them|`|PFXpmQgYaa	If youre willing to put in the work(a LOT of straightening) then the first one would be adorable on you.|`|6KVGwdBQaa	I like both.  Ask the person cutting your hair which style is best for your hair type.|`|UJ6FBGRyaa	Um well, i'll choose one, because it looks more prettier on u.|`|z1kAswfpaa	i think the 2nd one you prob wont listen to me cuz everytone else is saying the 1st one but i think it looks more you...the other one seems sort of preppy and all girlyish from your pic that doesnt really seem u so i think the 2nd|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	1|`|i1T8yKhpaa	1st :)|`|b04999b0e7ff207909ed958e37c605caaa	2nd     wait why am i here?|`|7DJkwzKDaa	yeah get the FIRST cut it would look good =)|`|teIblDHiaa	I like Lauren's 'do muchhh better.

Her bangs would look really cute on you and better than the short ones in the first picture   (:|`|IfGTdMvAaa	the first way.|`|MXpW48lFaa	The first one :)|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Like the first one :)|`|PAY58zPNaa	the first jess simpson one.|`|2tLswGNuaa	i think the first one would match you better|`|pD5Skzdpaa	It's already cut like that, shoulder length with layers. no big style going on there at all.|`|7hZdI5sJaa	i like the second one :)|`|GiEinn85aa	Definitely the first one. It's cute and I like it too.|`|vZBwdXPyaa	They're both cute, but the second is already a lot like your hair. The first is really nice so i would say go with the Jess Simpson one!|`|0mcvCOfyaa	First one, and you may not want to put such a creepy pic of yourself up...you eyes scared me...but your cute and that will look cute in black/brown. Good luck!|`|3IXj7jQNaa	1 your so pretty.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	Sorry to break it to you but those cuts are almost the same. Jessica has more swisshy volume.|`|zIGTzoxjaa	first|`|hPBMwEr5aa	The first one way more flattering. I think It would look cool with dark hair too. Although your hair is ever so cute as is!|`|bM9Y79wHaa	Mmmm, second one|`|yhGNTRE8aa	1 def.  pretty!|`|94ITHKFTaa	umm, i guess first one!    i think you're really pretty tho|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	you're cute!   i'd say go with the first one=]  good luuck.
hDeNKwNpaa	dont really matter to me i dont really care what your hair looks like i pay more attention to how people are if their nice, smart and fun and if they can be themselves, but anyway yeah ponytails are ok but i really like hair down and curly|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	I was gonna ask a similar question. I wanna know too. :]|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	Whoa. I'm a girl and even I don't care that much about hair.
AA10185229	lancome bronzer for legs is amazing.  you only have to use it one day a week and your set.  and you can see where you've put lotion so you don't end up all blotchy!  :)|`|09ed7150ac18474c23f9f24155554927aa	I really like clinique's tanning mousse.. its colored so you can see where it goes and its a light foam so your skin absorbs it fast. Everytime I go to buy it theyre usually out because they say everyone loves it.
fJUrCcJyaa	It suits you! =)|`|AA12270223	I'm not a big fan of guys with long hair...Tom hanks has tried to carry that do lately...and has failed...I think you might have too...that's just  my opinion through.|`|VegwUJiCaa	it looks perfectly fine on u :)|`|yhGNTRE8aa	its okay|`|ekF4YVMiaa	It's cool as..|`|pD5Skzdpaa	yeah but the beard looks sh*t.|`|kJic9nVnaa	It looks great!

SwaDNKELaa	I am getting my monroe done soon myself. But i already have my helix/cartilage done and for me it did not hurt at all! They say the monroe is the least painful and is the most safest facial piercing. Obviously the monroe may hurt more then your cartilage because of where it is. People i know said the monroe (on a scale of 1-10) hurt as much as a 3 and 4. It will only hurt badly if they hit the vein there (and/or positioned wrong) or if its infected also if you have a low tolerance of pain. But professionals know how to position it so if you get it done professionally, which I'm sure you will, you should be fine. Yes it can get infected more easily than others because its also an "oral" piercing. I have done research on this piercing to see the risks and whatnot so this is from my personal knowledge and what other sources has told me.Everyone has a different tolerance of pain, but to me, the monroe may hurt more. I am also getting my helix/cartilage done again. I hope this is helpful!|`|DfgHAPAwaa	cartilage hurts WAYY more|`|99193d34fb187b6ea3af8b00a6a9ce62aa	Don't have the monroe..Have had several cartilage..? They do hurt bad.? You can't sleep on that side for EVER..And they almost never heal completely.? The hospital made me take all 3 of mine out when I had a c section surgery and by the time (2 days later) I was released from the hospital, they were closed.? I had them done 10 yrs before that!? Just my experience.? Best of luck!!!|`|xZo4wP6Faa	don't have the monroe piercing, heard it was extremely painful and the healing can be rough.  as far as cartilage, it was the least painful piercing i've had--out of labret, lip rings on both sides, nose, eyebrow, ears up & down, belly, and nipples. it barely hurt or bled at all and the healing was quick & easy, hell i was in 6th grade when i got it done, that should tell you something. i'd give the pain a 3.|`|SiGVPuFmaa	Cartilage piercings are more painful and take longer to heal.    Monroe piercings aren't bad. Make sure you take care of it.|`|TEiFX1iPaa	i just got two monroes (angel bites) about a week and a half ago  for me they were my least painful piercings to date and ive had my nostril done on 3 occasions and my septum done twice now   its mostly a brief pain and a sting after the needle goes in. mine didn't bleed at all like my septum and  nostrils did. it does swell up but  so far the healing has been incredibly easy and i love them  im terrified of cartilage piercings though  .|`|3ZawTMauaa	None of them hurt.  I honestly pierced all my own.  I did my Septum, Monroe, Ears, Industrial etc.  None of them really hurt me.  Maybe it's my pain tolerance.  But don't be afraid.  It will be fine
duvefvbQaa	is this a joke!! she is gorgeous nice full lips clear pretty skin nice symmetry nice eyes the glasses are a tad big though i suggest contacts|`|WOBAN2iqaa	Shes definately pretty, probly an 8. The prettiest thing about a chick i rekon is confidence. You dont have to look like Miranda Kerr or Delta Goodrem. You have to look like yourself, thats pretty|`|qXCgeye3aa	5ish|`|IeZkqmIQaa	If your friend say she not pretty, than I dont know what pretty means.|`|sARYW9hIaa	6|`|oTiTwGmdaa	ummm 4 or 5|`|bOduFl9Baa	4 or 5|`|HaBirFkXaa	She is pretty  id say 9 out 10 :]|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	10. She's very cute!|`|OID8OB1eaa	well shes not GORGEOUS. but shes very pretty if she took off the glasses and wore contacts.|`|88RC9jsUaa	coming from another girl 3-4|`|PW2GQgxBaa	Actually, she's got that sexy, smart look to her but I can tell she's kinda young...she's an 8 for now, but in the future, give about 5 years, she'll be a 10...and I'm extremely superficial.|`|HWRRFA0qaa	6 maybe w/o the glasses she'd look prettier|`|GUf19aZ4aa	shes ok...  5ish|`|WB8uBODtaa	4.|`|APNzM50Saa	Very pretty 8.5|`|VegwUJiCaa	10|`|8MVrUtbAaa	She's decent, coming from a girls point of view, prolly a 4 or 5...  xoxo|`|ruenEu8Yaa	I'd say 7...    she is pretty|`|FBQOBhqIaa	She's a pretty young gal, I'd say 7-8...beautiful hair;)|`|u98ygMLCaa	i aint gonna lie to get the ten pts.. probably like 4 or 5, and you dont have to say its someone else  u can just say its you
jyYvLxn5aa	Well it depends on personal opinion. In my opinion, I like snake bites better than spider bites. Then again, it also depends if you are putting rings or studs in.   p.s. Pain tolerance has nothing to do with it. Either way- its two piercings. Its a needle puncturing your skin. Its gonna hurt, but it's tolerable. The only thing that sucks majorly, is afterwards... the swelling is a b****|`|34fad1a91f99e1ec3ee9a5eeabf40332aa	Snake Bites IMO.
WQbHHOJ4aa	I can't really tell you about the pain but, I would get snake bites...I'm actually thinking of getting them myself.  I'm not really a fan of spider bites.|`|xQQGJ7U0aa	I'd definitely say spider bites.  They're noticeable enough that you can show off your piercing(s), but they don't jump out and possibly look bad for when you're starting to think about a college/job/career.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I would need to see a photo of you to see what would fit best.|`|1pUIwBM1aa	Snake bites are like totally 2005.      Get ANGEL BITES!!!  Which is a monroe on each side if you didn't know.|`|kMLaynNWaa	IT YOU BODY BUT IN THE FUTURE ALOT OF JOBS DONT LIKE THIS UNLESS YOUR GOING TO BE A TATOO ARTIST IM A MODEL BUT I DONT HAVE TATOOS BUT SOME CAN HAVE SMALL ONE THEY HIDE WITH MAKE UP AND AIR BRUSH LADYS THAT ARE ELGENT CLASSY AND DANTY GET REAL MEN|`|SiGVPuFmaa	snake bites.
RAzV6v5Aaa	i have the enzo milano iron and practicly the same hair type.  it happens to be AMAZING!  i love it and totally recomend it!   the downside is somtimes it leaves my hair dry  i love it though, its the best!|`|lyrS9wSuaa	chi has great irons. they don't Only make flat irons|`|sokzKmtiaa	well I have the remington curls,curls,curls iron and it works really well for me -I have really long hair and it doesnt do much so I got this, the lady at a store recomended this to me but eh,  (it comes with 3 diff. sized tong things)
XgejRqWsaa	you can prob find magnetic studs at Spencers or Walmart
jyYvLxn5aa	buy yourself a flat iron//straightener.   they're real simple to use and come in a couple different sizes depending on how long your hair is and how thick it is.  good luck :]|`|ekF4YVMiaa	I've never seen an asian with curly hair. That's all i can say.
b6V4wDaZaa	I personally would never use pantene pro-v anything. I've tried it before and it left my hair soft but had a layer of film on it. Anyone from every hair salon has told me to NEVER use pantene pro-v anything, I guess they have a lot of wax in their products and it coats your hair. I'd go to sally beauty supply and see what they have there.
4bf0fa1c3be1c0172a039c0df22c2310aa	i like the badge symbol...thats cute    the wrist hurts the closer you get to the hand lol...but its really not unbearable.   let me tell you...if it's something you really want, it's worth it.    Don't be afraid of pain. If it hurts, it hurts for awhile and it'll be over quick..pain's not permanent and you sure wont die.     hope this helps  =)|`|v3dTJIrcaa	I understand the emotions...but don't get it where it shows at 18. If later you decide to enter the corporate work or something similar you may have some problems....I have tats but they are all covered by clothing....but...    20 DOLLARS A LETTER PLUS A TIP  IT IS GOING TO HURT BAD ON YOUR WRIST    Just wait and get a nice life size badge on you arm or somewhere else.|`|EuVBm1W7aa	Not sure on the price, depends on where you go. I would say probably no more than 100.     As for the pain, of course it hurts. But it is still tolerable. I have one on my wrist and it hurt but the whole tattoo took like 2 minutes. It was very fast.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	small police badge and about 70 dollars|`|PFBKuVhBaa	dont know about the cost  but i have a tattoo on my right wrist, i didnt have trouble with jobs because mine wasnt obscene or anything its a heart.  but anyways. the pain is kinda bad but manageable, if you really want a tattoo, gotta suck up the pain and be a trooper  :) good luck|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I would get the outline of a badge and the numbers inside of it... that would eliminate the need for a little symbol with it.     A tattoo on the wrist is uncomfortable, but tolerable. To me it feels like a cat scratch on a sunburn. It doesn't take that long, and they do a test line with no ink to make sure you can handle the pain.     It should cost between $50 and $100 for the tattoo you have described.    As for colors, I say you should get the outline of the badge in black, the numbers in black, and the badge part filled in gold.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	Please don't get a tattoo on your wrist, it literally is as bad as getting a tattoo on your face. I have one on my wrist and after being fired from my job, I wasn't able to find another job because most places have regulations about tattoos that show..      Oh and it hurts like a b****, my back didn't hurt that bad but my wrist almost made me passout. :'(|`|FS9ibKB5aa	i agree with shy girl.  you should consider what she said.
BQ8FuBo9aa	ive seen alot of them obviously these people dont read tattoo magazines...there are not many things out there anymore that someone doesnt already have...your tattoo should have some sort of meaning to you..so when someone asks you what it means and why you got it, the answer isn't "i dont know" i thought it was cool..|`|bKtpUETnaa	no if you want it get it|`|8THz1sp9aa	I've only seen a few, and if it's meaningful to you why should it matter?|`|1pUIwBM1aa	No! Woah. I've never heard of someone getting that lol|`|LBHJaqXoaa	DNA tattoos are not cliche. In fact, I think one would be cool. Especially the way you described it. I have never seen a DNA tattoo. That's a very original tattoo.|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	That would be an epic tattoo.|`|0VBESmFQaa	I think a dna helix would be bad ***, I don't think i have ever seen one before as a tattoo|`|JkpyLnfDaa	i dont think so:)  sounds cool, and if its what you want then dont worry about cliche, just get it|`|eDhRrOaEaa	Personally, I think its very original... not that I've heard of much anyways but never have I heard that!    Originality rules!|`|7d49b2027a8f862fe2535799f563f18daa	That's a really sick idea, go for it :]|`|xuV1xsImaa	I have never seen a DNA tattoo. But I wouldn't do it around your wrist, bands are a Lil tacky. I think it would look cool on the bottom side of your wrist.
VK3kyzGDaa	If you have a lei wear that.  You should wear a Turquoise or a Lime green.    Wear flip flops  and shorts to make it look like you are going to Hawaii.      Good luck tomorrow.

duvefvbQaa	etercise and just practice ur skills by urself till u get real good at acting and singing get urself a monologue book at barns and nobles and try out all diff type of personalities oh and do it in front of a mirror to see what u look like when u know ur good u will know then show them what u got and tell ur bf to get lost he sounds rude|`|xWD4XG7Naa	eat right, drink lots of water, fruits, veg, exercise. do for u first before u do for others.|`|ncGMwLLHaa	best solution, don't change yourself. if you are happy with who you are, then why bother? if you want too improve yourself, try jogging. it sounds like a drag, but take it slow and you'll be hooked. plus the fat will melt off. obviously, eat healthy. you probably know what healthy foods are, so i'm not even going to go there. also, for a new look, go to a department store to the makeup section, and get a free makeover. you will get the look and you can get similar makeup at target if you don't wanna spend much. finally, dump the bf. you need a guy who likes you for you. there you go, a new you! hope this helped, good luck :)|`|GUf19aZ4aa	wtf is wrong with your mom??  shes not supposed to criticize you, shes supposed to support you...|`|ekF4YVMiaa	If you bf thinks of you that way, DUMP HIM.    OKAY??  If he seriously likes you, he would like evry part of your body. You don't need any chemicals and stuff to make yourself "fake"    JUST BE YOU!!|`|OMOuxROoaa	well so what your hair is thin whatever....walk with confidence it shows...if your bf don't like you leave him....everybody is not cut out for the whole singing and dancing thing maybe she can do better so you have talents hidden somewhere....92 lbs really like that is fat.....not really. Get a hip hop dance video to start you will boost energy, tone up and learn to dance.........you will feel better...oh and confront your man get to the bottom or find someone who does respect you.|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Just eat healthy and try to be on the positive side maybe take a break from all the put downs and feel confident to improve on what you love to do (your interests), nobody should make anyone feel less than a human being, take care dear...;)|`|WOBAN2iqaa	You can start by surrounding yourself with the people who support you not critise you sweety. Watch what you eat, i no your broke but protein shakes or powder work cos they make you feel fuller for longer. Everyones talented in different areas, maybe singing and dancing isnt right for you. Find something you enjoy and that will shine through. Write your songs about how you feel, people can relate to the issues your dealing with. Chin up! Your better than that
gZk3pjF2aa	You could get the sparrow that Johnny Depp got on his wrist or a quote like "bring me that horizon" with a sunset or something? (:|`|VU4DLpnlaa	i once saw someone with a small tattoo of one of the 'working girls' corsets and that looked really good, you could say it's you celebrating you're female sexuality if you started to hate the film.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	A lot of people are getting sparrow tattoos (like the one on Jack's wrist). Myself as a HUGE pirate fan, I'm getting the Flying Dutchman (not just a pirates of the Caribbean thing) ship tattooed onto my ribcage. But you could also do the skull with two swords or just a pirate flag... Google pirate tattoo, there's some really cool ideas there.|`|0a832913d812cc753c9626c54fc44cc8aa	Get the sparrow just like Jack's thats on his wrist.|`|HbZGe23naa	Here's a good one lol, but seriously i love the pirates idea i have a skull and cross bone, it would remind you of pirates but not mean anything to others and a quote from the movie|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	You can get a pirate flag and have "hoist the colors" underneath it. It's a pirate slogan and it's used in the movie.
mWqxEMsjaa	coz shes got *** lol :)|`|AA11950233	I didn't know they were.  I don't like looking at her|`|AA11910088	Why cause they are some HATERS|`|0FktuJjeaa	She's not too fat and she' s pretty lol
h6NqNzHAaa	measure the pants you have
GmghrL4Iaa	you're pretty but u need to take out all ur piercings and stuff out.  How tall are u?   Weight?

You have like that special model pretty where like you're the average pretty. I think you should try it, you'll probably have to lose the piercing though.  (:|`|7DJkwzKDaa	NOT WITH THAT PIERCING ON UR FACE!

By the way, work on your eyeliner ; )|`|zfPH6LmBaa	oh no no.... you look average to me|`|oDr6p88Eaa	I think you have a lot of potential. You might not be a Victoria's Secret model because you don't have blonde hair and huge boobs (well, it doesn't suit your frame, lol) but you really do have a lot of potential for fashion magazines and maybe a store like Urban Outfitters? I wish you the best!    :]|`|7hZdI5sJaa	i think your very pretty, but to me you dont look like a model :)|`|QeO8t3eCaa	yeahh i love your eyes|`|F0vnLoaIaa	YES !  you have an odd look to u , get into couture thats what i do its not your conventional stuff  its about alot of extremes !! =D|`|17MZkNpZaa	yes hun you have very dramatic eyes|`|QQ1Vwsj8aa	hard to say, they need models of all kinds, good luck with ever you do|`|38GEhj3iaa	Your very pretty.

Most colors seem to go well in black hair, I just wouldn't recommend blonde.|`|PFXpmQgYaa	Honestly, I wouldn't get highlights. Jet black hair looks kinda weird them. If you want a change, I would suggest getting maybe a bold stripe of dark reddish brown on the bottom layer of your hair, or maybe dyeing all of your hair a VERY dark brownnish red color.|`|clnUZ6rWaa	try wild unnatural colors.    like...  blue   red  purple  pink  and......      green

46fouwFfaa	First of all, there is absolutely nothing wrong with nappy hair. If it's taken care of well it is usually very beautiful. Secondly, there are many fully black Africans that do not have nappy hair. Ever hear of East Africa? These are Somali nomads, who since they move around a lot, do not have daily access to electricity and cannot straighten their hair. Weaves or fake hair are not sold in Somalia.     Does this look like coarse hair to you?    http://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.w...    What about these Afar women, indigenous to Ethiopia and Djibouti?    http://farm1.static.flickr.com/99/286754...    Perhaps, those you've seen do not know how to take care of their hair properly. But please do not stereotype a whole race of people who you apparently do not know much about.|`|9MBJXDBUaa	Dang man I wanna know the same thing! My niece is part African (her daddy from Africa) and she light a can be and got the hair like a mixed child. But me on the other hand, I'm straight up black and my hair is fairly long for an African American but it's because my momma put a lot of "stuff" *wink* in my head when I was little. But when I take a shower it poofs up like a got a Afro. I hate it. But oh well.

aEbuB8Mwaa	1. Use eyeliner only on the outer rim of the eyelids, not the inner rim.   2. Blend eyeliner with a cotton swab rather than leaving it as a harsh line.   3. Avoid drawing eyeliner on the inner corner of the lower lid; instead, start the line at the beginning of eyelash growth or even closer to the middle of the eye.   4. Use a light shade of eye shadow on the upper lid leading up to the brow, which will open up the eye. A darker color can be used in the fold of the eye.   5. Consider wearing false eyelashes to give your eyes a more wide-eyed, innocent look. Be sure to use natural-looking eyelashes.   6. Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler before applying mascara to give you the same effect as false eyelashes.   7. Try a black mascara if brown does not bring out your eyes enough.    Tips:  -Chill your eye pencils before you sharpen them. They'll be less likely to break.  -Try a fat crayon, which has a creamy-powdered texture, for a liner that is soft and less severe.  -Try getting a makeover the next time you're at a cosmetic counter. Ask the person who does your makeover to help you emphasize your eyes.  -Lining your eyes all the way around will make them look smaller, not bigger.|`|KbUIttmqaa	Put white eyeliner on the bottom waterline of your eye. dont rim your eyes entirely in black. use a brown, dark gray, or olive green liner. apply mascara.     hope this helps!|`|Mg6fSXfOaa	If you have small eyes, use a liner in the color of your eyes.  Green is very pretty.  Outline the bottom of your eye in this and then on the top lid apply a highlighter shadow in a bright color (white) and then blend this in with a green eye shadow pencil. apply a brown mascara to the top lashes (the brown contrasts the green to make your eyes pop) NEVER apply mascara to the bottom lashes. it makes you look trampy.  this is what i do for my green small eyes, and it really makes them POP!      Hope I Helped!!! :)

eBT6dNOcaa	whatever you do if you want bigg eyes then dont put eyeliner on your inner rim on the bottom.  it will make them look smaller and squinty.  put it on and smudge and blend it a bit.  and hair  --  dry it from behind you bangs and blow forward and to the side.   i dont really know how to explain that.
wDDsNDRSaa	Green, gray, navy, brown, deep purple, and orange-red will make your green eyes pop because those colors compliment the cones in your eyes...making the green stand out more.  It's good to have solid color shirts, but don't be afraid to mix it up!  Find shirts that have these colors in patterns like plaid or houndstooth or something like that.  You don't wanna be the plain jane with magnificent eyes....you wanna be the hottie with the prettiest eyes!  Right?  Happy hunting and good luck with everything!|`|KBBonf97aa	Next time you're in a clothing store, grab a bunch of green and teal shirts and hold them up to your face in front of a mirror.  A lot of times, green or blue eyes "pop" when you wear a shade that's in the same color family.  Lighter colors usually make your eyes appear brighter and darker ones make them look more intense. It's almost like the eyes reflect the color of the shirt.  The effect can be really amazing.  I've been asked on some occasions whether I'm wearing colored contacts, since my eyes look so distinctive in certain shades.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	You could heat your skull to the point that the fluid boils, that might make them pop.    A sledge hammer to the cranium, or set your head on a busy intersection.  Maybe a train track.|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	that's kinda weird.   but anyways. green is good. red is good. for guys it's kinda hard. go with pink :D lol|`|Ul1OCP8Iaa	Wear brown, green (obviously), and white.

v14XlT6Zaa	If you don't have bangs, get them. They are completely in right now, plus if you have a somewhat high forward and/or cow-lick (like me) they can definitely be a more attractive alternative. Get "whispy" straight ones, that way you don't have to worry about them looking uneven.     what else... hmm... get layers? maybe long layers just at the tip-areas of your hair... its different but at the same time your not making your actual hair length shorter.

Try flipping through a hair magazine, getting the color changed/highlights, or get layers. Layers isn't really getting it cut, and it looks REALLY good with highlights or a new color. Hope that helped you some!
geJM58L2aa	First of all, you're curly hair is B-E-A-Utiful!  My hair used to be even curlier than yours and I loved it but I also loved straightening it so I did that once or twice a week.  Now from straightening it so much it doesn't curl anywhere close to how it used to and I miss it so just keep that in mind if you plan on straightening your hair a lot!    After experimenting with my hair all through high school the easiest way I found to straighten my hair is this..    - Wash your hair thoroughly   - Blow dry you hair with my head flipped upside down while brushing my hair at the same time, that way it starts straightening you hair already  - Seperate your hair into 3 horizontal levels, working from bottom to top  - Seperate each level into 3 or 4 sections [depending on thickness of hair]  - Run the straightener through the sections/levels  - Once you have your hair straightened, spray just a little hairspray around and brush it through    I normally leave my hair straightened for 2 or 3 days before washing it again.  I hope this works for you or at least helps a little!  I know what it's like to spend forever straightening and it gets very tiring.  -|`|KkFKdRG8aa	My friend is the same way and she uses a relaxing conditioner in the shower before she does it. you can probabaly find it in wherever you fin shampoo or conditioner.    also try looking for hair products in the stores that relax hair. maybe even Herbal Essences "Dangerously Straight" shampoo and conditioner.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	Easy. Blow-dry your hair after you wash it, and use a good hair straightener like CHI.
tpIQXRYraa	okay i have bangs too, sometimes they get annoying anyways if you have to have something in your hair put a headband/ bandana/ bow(claries, hottopic) umm you could put them to the side, if you were them up all the time that could look silly, but if you like that it's okay.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	get a tick headband!! all the girls i know do that and it looks great :) try lulu lemon!!|`|uDLTAw8Taa	I have bang too.

You can also quote sources to make you more professional! Parents love maturity.

Mg6fSXfOaa	My hair is EXACTLY the same as this. I hate it.  What i do makes it much more manageable and a lot cuter. After a shower, DONT let your hair air dry.  the longer your hair air dries, the poofier it gets (trust me, personal experience). Right after a shower, apply a small amount of anti-frizz serum and blow dry it with a good blow-dryer.  if you want volume, blow dry your hair with it flipped over. after blow-drying your hair, you can straighten it, or if you dont have time, or just want something done quick, you can follow these steps for a cute, stylish look:   1.  get a flat paddle brush    2.  spary some Aussie shine spray hair spray on the brush and brush through all of your hair.   3. then, pull the bangs up in a poof, or pull all your hair up into a ponytail.     Hope this helped!!!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Make sure you are not using a Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Look for one for dry and fizzy hair. That will help to tame it.    I also agree that messing with it as little as possible will help. I have found with my crazy hair is that after it is dry the more I mes with it the flatter it gets.    You can also put an anti-frizz stuff in there or even just a lite gel and really get it all in there.|`|qPIsxtPDaa	blow dry it alot while brushing this helps the frizzyness. it may be something ur using in the shower. So try to find that out..hope i helped!!=D lol|`|O9VW6RjEaa	i had the same problem, but then i discovered a product to control the poof and frizz. =) it's called hair milk. XDD  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...  pricey, but totally worth it.  it also induces hair growth. ;)|`|AHeLeaMBaa	When it is wet you could try putting your hair in a loose braid or twist--this will stretch your hair so it doesn't poof as much.|`|AA11563243	i have the same hair, and I've finally found a way to correct this problem without spending so much money! after years of battling my hair, I've tamed it. i use a cheap, $3 conditioner: Tresemme for curly hair (I'm pretty sure it's a white bottle with green decorations). after i get out of the shower, i pull it into a bun. i sleep with my hair wet and braid it in one single braid when its dry. when i wake up, as i'm getting ready for school, i alternate with pulling my hair into a bun and braiding it. trust me, this really works, and it's a cheap way to handle frizz and poof.|`|WdtJaNdEaa	First of all, don't touch your hair when it's wet. That increases frizz.    You can use a frizz/shine serum to tame the frizz; one example is John Frieda Frizz-Ease.    You can also use a shampoo specially formulated for your hair. There are undoubtedly several at your local drugstore.
Zp4PAdmUaa	Please don't take offense at what I'm about to tell you, but it's kind of shallow of you to even ask this.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	My favorite kind of conditioner is Aubrey Organics which you can get at a whole foods or similar store. They're really moisturizing. The best kinds for curly hair are either Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia. Another kind I like from the drugstore is L'oreal Vive Pro Nutri Gloss for Medium to Long Hair that's Wavy/Curly. My favorite shampoo (very gentle) is Giovanni Triple Tea Treat. I've found it at whole foods and ULTA.    If you want your hair to not be frizzy your going to have to use some kind of product. I recommend using a leave in conditoner underneath a gel. Currently I am using Giovanni Direct Leave in condish (another whole foods product) underneath Herbal Essences body envy gel (drugstore). It works great!    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm    HTH! :)|`|1o6bzLVbaa	try using 3 minute miracle from aussie. it's like conditioner.  http://well.ca/images/large/products/aus...

The darker the harder it is. Using hot water and alot of washing your hair for a couple of days will help fade it. Using products at home will end up damaging your hair.

9pgb4IpNaa	wear jeans, a bright colored shirt, and bright colored flats/shoes|`|gnspm2Iaaa	You could wear plain jeans (I would think maybe a real light, bleachy looking kind, ripped maybe not for thsi style, although it depends on your personal taste) with an orange purse and orange flats.  that could be really cute :)|`|oPdR3FHkaa	look at the model in the pic|`|alOaBeSXaa	that jacket is lush  yeah  if its fitted to you baggy jeans may be nice  but skinnys would work too if you have good legs  and just a small black shoulder bag would be aces|`|50Ia20yXaa	i always wanted on of those. i think i would wear some skinny jeans with balck heels and a cute thin scarf to go with that.     and a bag like this...|`|k24ulNX0aa	It really depends on your style. Forgive me for the examples, but let's say Demi Lovato was wearing the jacket. She'd probably wear it with a bright colored shirt underneath, black skinny jeans and boots, or with a white shirt and a scarf with the jeans and boots. That's a darker style, but if you're preppier/classier, then you'd dress more like Selena Gomez, who might wear that with a simple shirt and skinny jeans and flats. Now, if you've got a somewhat in-between style like Miley Cyrus, you can wear that over pretty much any tee with jeans and cute shoes (not very specific, I know.). Miley wears lots of colorful boots and tees.    Hope this helps! And cute jacket, by the way :)

XKMdrsQ9aa	Absolutely not. Human hair extensions cannot be ruined by just simply sitting there. It's like almost as if it was just on your head the whole time. But, yes please do wash them. Lots of dust and dirt and other things of that nature will be gathered up on them. FYI if any extensions whether they be human hair or synthetic, if they are sitting in the package they arrived in, there would be no reason as to why they could even be ruined. [: So no worries!|`|Hx4AqA98aa	they shouldnt be messed up if you have human hair|`|clnUZ6rWaa	if its human hair, it wont get ruined if you wash it, but be carful, if the extensions are cheaply made, some hair could fall out.     But it would not completly ruin hair.|`|ltnXWIpNaa	Hello    They should be OK if they are high quality hair extensions.    if dry, use a good conditioner on them.
nVjLYWFWaa	I have the pink daydreamer bag, i regret buying the pink one but I LOVE pink but it gets SO dirty. Anyway, I took it to the dry cleaners and it came out pretty nice. Of course its never going to look like its brand new but it looked pretty clean
NBLmYWRBaa	get some scotch guard. it repels liquids and block stains. its like  five bucks, then u spray on a couple of coats a waabam! waterproof! well dont go stepping in huge puddles tho :D.|`|NGUAJasPaa	pam on the bottoms and a cheapish water-proofing spray on the top.|`|RYVKYYnAaa	if you go to any shoe store they have that water proofing spray you could try... it worked for my shoes.|`|4RMInr2raa	put a large sandwitch bag in them|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Well you can get waterproofing sprays for shoes. But that is really for shoes which are already semi water proof. Unfortunately, ugg boots were invented to be worn to keep your feet warm and also down to your local shop to buy the paper on a sunday morning (Aussie tradition hehe), if you get them wet they will do what all sheepskin products do, and will go a slightly different colour and become a little stiffer. That's just the type of shoes they are.
LBHJaqXoaa	Please wait until you are old enough to get a real tattoo. The risk of infection is very high when done with a tattoo "gun" (they're called tattoo machines, by the way) and you will probably go too deep and scar yourself. You probably don't even have access to tattoo ink, and any other ink will just bleed out or fade. It will look like crap and you will regret it for the rest of your life. It will look like a prison tat.     If you have any respect for yourself at all you will wait and get one professionally done. I'm not trying to sound rude or anything, I just really think everyone deserves a NICE tattoo and a home made tattoo is never, ever nice.|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	Wait wait wait wait waaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiit. I got a makeshift tattoo when I was 20, had to spend $400 just to get it covered!!! Not to mention the embarrassment when it came out looking like a demon instead of an angel. She needed all sorts of surgery, tummy tuck, face lift, boob job....ect.. lol Wait until you can get it professionally done, if you still want it in 4 years, then theres less probability you will regret it. I also have a tattoo on my wrist, and I regret it but nothing I can do about it. :(|`|bSxEfkZQaa	At 14, I went through literally hundreds of different tatoo ideas. Once it was the name of a guy, then some lyrics, then then lyrics changed, some hearts, stars, flowers, bands... etc.     I don't have any, but the risk of getting infected with a tattoo machine made at home is very high. They go through many precautions to make sure they're sterilized at the shop, don't think you won't get some sort of infection. Trust me, you will.      At 14, it is illegal to get a tattoo. And in one year, you will want something completely different. Wait another 4 years (it won't kill you), and find something that means a lot to you. Then go to a shop, and they'll do it properly.       Only get a tattoo if it means something to you. I'm sorry but 2 stars is pointless, and I'm pretty sure it's only cause they're pretty.|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	It would hurt way beyond anything you could stand to do to yourself. Don't do it, seriously, it would look like crap. Rethink ... if you have any sense of whats safe you won't give this any more thought. Just have fun being a kid before you have to pay bills and people really expect things from you.|`|RwuLAbZCaa	well think of this it's a needle moving in and out of your skin and it will be there for the rest of your life make sure you really think about it before you do it, ask ppl who have them also|`|gZk3pjF2aa	This sounds like a really bad idea. Not only will hurt BAD but it will probably get infected without proper care, especially if you're trying to hide it from your parents. Just wait until you're 18 and can do it the smart and LEGAL way. Or at least learn to spell "tattoo" before you try and give yourself one. (:|`|alOaBeSXaa	my first ink was on my hips  they really hurt  and youre only 14  wait  i wanted loads of ink when i was 14  and i changed my mind sooooo much as i got older|`|oDr6p88Eaa	Well, it depends on how much fat you have there. If you have really lean and skinny hips, it will hurt, but if you have a little meat, it might not hurt so badly.     Why do you want to get a tattoo? How gross will that be in 30 to 40 years when you have kids and a husband? Tattoos don't go away. The only way to get them removed is with a laser, and if you're so concerned about pain with the tattoo, believe me that will hurt worse, and it leaves you with gross scars!    Also, most tattoo parlors don't do tattoos at 14, meaning you'd go to someone who would, meaning he/she is not certified, meaning a possible dirty needle, meaning AIDS/HIV, Hepatitis, etc.    Watch yourself out there, girl!      peace. =]|`|4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	You tell me. 7 needles jabbing directly on your hip bone. Nothing but a few layers of skin and bone. It will hurt. It will hurt bad. Very bad.     On top of that. I know you said you were 14 and I know that pregnancy and babies are the last thing on your mind, but if you plan to permantly mark yourself with a tattoo, you may want to think of the future.     Those tiny, sexy, cute little tats you want so badly may not be too wise. If or when you get pregnant (hopefully deep into the future) those tiny little stars may turn into a stretched out mess. An un-fixable mess. If you are prone to stretch marks and you get pregnant and a stretch mark goes through one of those stars. Forget it girl. You will look like someone dumped ink on you and you will have a permanent mess on your body.   My sis had a sun around her belly button and stars on her hips. Now, after a few kids it looks like a 2 year old drew on her with permanent marker. It looks SOOOOOOO bad!     As a woman...the best advice I can give it to not tattoo anything on or near the tummy or the back. The tramp stamp as they call it....don't think one doesn't get stretch marks on their lower back.     Also...another nice tidbit.....if your mom has stretch marks, you will likley get them as well. Stretch marks are hereditary. It has to do with a lack of elastisity in the skin. And all that Palmer's Cocoa Butter For Stretch Marks they advertise on TV? Garbage. If your gonna get them, its inevitable. There is no magic cream or lotion.     Hey, tats are very cool...but one needs to think about the placment of these tattoos. They will be with you for life. Think: "Is this a tattoo I can respect myself for having when I'm 20? Or 30? or 40?    Think about it..........|`|xQQGJ7U0aa	Yeah....I wanted lots of ink when I was 14 too. I'm still only 19 and I've changed my mind a thousand times. I'm so unsure that I still haven't gotten my first one.     They have the rules about not working on minors for reasons. The younger you are, the more likely you'll regret it, too.  And if you try to do it at home, you'll almost definitely have a substandard tat. It takes lots of practice to do a good job.     Just wait til you're legal.|`|fmpWgLrGaa	You shouldn't be able to something unless you know how to spell it.|`|nZuqEicQaa	If you can't spell the word tattoo right, you really, legally shouldnt be allowed to get one at all.    but, just for knowledge's sake.    The hips are a somewhat painful place. There are morepainful places, but there arealso less plainful ones.     On a scale of one to ten, its about an 8.|`|JafLyLYgaa	For the love of god, do NOT make a makeshift tattoo gun. ITs not going to look professional and you'll regret it. Your still growing so you arent going to want a tattoo till you arent going to stretch out that much more anyways. Plus when you are that young, your pain tolerance is really low usually, so its basically going to hurt a lot.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	nooooo, i did one on my ankle with pen ink a compass and although it lasted for 3 years i was ill for months, not worth it. and really 4 years is not a long time to wait, it's been 9 since i decided what i wanted and i haven't changed my mind since, but at least now i'm legal and i know what i want doing.
L3j2HrsJaa	Rip the hair off the flesh? Wow, that sounds really cruel.  Remove hair with a depilatory cream sounds much better to me.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	lol.  Do you have a job that is very boring too.  The things I have been thinking up today.... I am surprised I haven't wondered about that too.  I wouldn't have a clue.  Eyebrows too.  I mean really, who gives a flying f*ck about having thinner eyebrows.  But like obedient little woman we do it because that is what's expepted.  F*ck it.  I'm growing my armpit hair from this day on.  I'm taking a stand!.  Oh do you mean the hair on the actual arm, not under.  Oh god no, who would do that?  I have a friend that even threw in a modelling job after they told her she had to wax her arms.  That's just wrong.|`|pD5Skzdpaa	Arms?, what society do you live in.|`|ncGMwLLHaa	hairy pits are gross, that's why. if you're talking about arms, i hate waxed arms. thhen the stubble grow back and you cant cover it up. ew.|`|6fD0r9Icaa	That sounds painful.|`|Zqr4D4Egaa	No kinds of sense.|`|6a60fc76b51aaef7e6e9051ad2ad4d85aa	none of coursse|`|V90Ao2jfaa	I know I'm mad at that too and yes "Red blazer" women have hairy arms, backs, asses etc. I'm part indian so i'm so friggen hairy it's annoying.

uGvVMYsqaa	I think its natural. It depends on how your hair is right now. Im guessing the girl put mousse on her hair and scrunched it up to give it that wavy/messy look and let it air dry.  Try it, if it doesn't work then use curling hair products.  Catwalk is a good brand|`|TFLS1EtKaa	its not really curled but not natural.  I am not sure sorry...|`|67d2a15ae64481f999d40bb559aeea69aa	its probably natural.  its more wavy than curled.  if you can do it depends on what your hair type is...|`|AA11563243	get a thick curling iron, curl sections of your hair, then run your fingers through your hair and pull it into a braid or two. after about five minutes, take it out of the braid, and you should have hair that resembles hers.

I also bite my nails because when they get too long i can not stand them but then they are crooked so i bite them even more!!|`|MONbNUmkaa	nothings gonna help if you don't completely stop the habit of biting them.  try going for regular manicures(after you spend time and money on your nails you'll be less likely to bite them)|`|Mg6fSXfOaa	I have used this product on my nails for about a year.  Yes it works very well!  I suggest you stop bitting your nails completely before using it though, because it tastes really bad:) to stop bitting your nails give yourself a manucure regularly, or use a nail bitting polish made to break the habit (it's a polish that tastes REALLY bad!) after using the treatment, paint your nails and make them pretty to show off the new look!!!

Stress does all kinds of things to your body. Lately I've been super stressed (we just got done with finals in school) and you would not believe how much acne I had during that time.

cDpu1Dxyaa	You need to rephrase your question as "how do I straighten my hair with a blow dryer"    Rub some straightenig blam through you hair, Pull  into three sections, two at the sides and one at the back. Clip the two sides up.   Use a thick, round brush and beginning at the roots, gently pull the brush through the hair to the ends while blow-drying it. Pull the hair away from your head, stretching and straightening it as you go.   Pull the brush through the underside of your hair so that you expose it directly to the heat of the dryer. Once that area is mostly dry, switch to the top of the hair.   Repeat for the rest of your hair!    Hope this helps!|`|myVECzQZaa	IF you want to straighten it then i wouldn't recommend you use a hair dryer to do it. If your hair is curly then you need like a flat iron to make it straight.|`|EgfL2c86aa	you could let it air dry and then straighten it...|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Basically what you do is use a brush, try one with heat resistant bristles and when you brush your hair, place the blow dryer directly against the brush and follow the brush towards the ends of your hair and then repeat. Sectioning out your hair will make it easier, like divide it into four sections and do each one at a time.|`|AA12224190	u can't blow dry your hair with a straightener cus if you do you can fry your hair and your hair will not look pretty just dry your hair then striaten it ... You will look way better|`|lyrS9wSuaa	if you have a comb attachment for your blow dryer you can use that.|`|8qHiM3Kyaa	if you do not already have then you need to get, a round brush and straitening serum. i suggest garnier fructis. then blow dry your hair in sections applying the serum.

Smoother legs for much longer than shaving.|`|dalNxu8zaa	use lotion when u shave.. or it might be ur razor|`|CO5jcxMraa	try the nars hair bleaching thing|`|BJ7TU9TRaa	that happens to me too!  what helps most is using a rough lufa (spelling?)  and scrubbingg your legs with it then shaving.  it exfoliates the skin and opens pores more so your razor will get closer.  please try it!  it helps ATON!! good luck :)|`|eHUfVlY5aa	I always put lotion on right after my skin dries from getting out of the shower. seems to help me with stubble.|`|WnRy6on6aa	-try nair or some other type of hair removing cream  -use the venus breeze (it's a purple razor, it comes with two bands of gel on the razor head)  -lazor hair removal|`|biiAAZqtaa	I don't have too much experience in trying different razors but if you're really desperate you can try things like Nair or waxing, but shaving seems to be easier.

MONbNUmkaa	OMG! the salespeople at that counter act as though they are the make up experts.  Yes they know what they are doing, but you also know what you want or how you want to look. don't let people intimidate you. your there to have a service provided, for which you are paying your good money(customer is always right). you need to be assertive when spending your money or people will sell you anything. if they give you flack get a manager. if i  understand the question you did as for the shade by name right? maybe she thought you were buying something site unseen and was going to show it to you? in which case she was providing good customer service.  next time as her to clarify what she means|`|SiGVPuFmaa	there isn't really a way to 'act' I'd recommend bringing the empty tube with you, then when you go to buy more there is no confusion.|`|KsBClGUEaa	okay when you want to ask for color matching, you should just say "hey i want to buy this item, but can you help me identify whats my color?"  and to be specific just tell them what your looking for like anything as close as possible to your product you want. (:|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Well if you want a color the same as the one you already have you should take the container with you even if its empty. When asking for a color try to find out the exact name like Strawberry Flush or whatever  Good Luck (I love MAC products)
AA12075899	You approach the girls at the MAC counters just like you would any other sales associate.  Just keep in mind what shade colors and finishes you want, for example...do you want the [lipstick, blush, or eyeshadow, etc] to be dark or light. What kind of finish do you want it to have, Matte [no shine or shimmer] or  Frost/Glaze/Lustre/Satin [which all have some sort of shimmer or shine]. When you go for a color matching just let them know you are interested in face products and want to get the closest shade to your skin tone as possible. I don't know if you were intimidate by her or what but don't be... if they seem like they think they are all that ask for another MUA and report the stuck up one. =)

I think that you shouldn't, but that you should definitely try something new.|`|wb0xV7PFaa	no maybe you should straiten it..Not to be rude or anything|`|HcjCdLehaa	I think so.|`|s8NxLAfZaa	no leave it like that|`|RbtDXV5baa	Yesss.. but grow your fringe a bit more before you get the cut :)|`|wOEhDUUlaa	sure try it out... then u'll know soon enough... if u really dont like after the fact just sport a hat for a while... after all it's just hair... it'll grow back!|`|ZEmlT5aEaa	i think it would look good plus its easier to maintain. i have the same type of hair as you but i straighten it everyday cuz i hate it!|`|6f99a7973a2e8b7b15ef800cf6e14fefaa	no , u look  better  with long  hair  and  u have  great  skin , u  shouldn't  cover it  with  ur hair|`|0pkAFo8vaa	Honestly I'm a fan of the way you look right now.|`|V90Ao2jfaa	You could do that as long as you don't mind straightening  your hair all the time and being really fussy about it. Also I think your hair color is kinda flat I would boost the whole color to a warmer color and add some highlights It could be the picture though.     PS. Wear lots of pretty earings.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	she looks like a turnip or eggplant head.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	It wouldn't, i'm sorry.|`|MgVsnEKvaa	i like the length how it is...but i agree with the straightening it idea. if you're looking for a change get some more color in your hair..or more layers around your face. or both:)|`|ishRTmt0aa	no it wouldnt at all. if you want your hair shorter cut it about to your chin and have them go shorter in the back. get all  kinds of choppy looking layers in it and it will look good.       maybe something like this:  http://www.hairstylescut.com/images/shor...  or this:  http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...  or like this:  http://www.womenshairstylesonline.com/Ha...        hope this helped!
HkGSx0HIaa	no, i use this mascara. The clumps are supposed to be there, it's what makes it look big don't worry :)|`|wvN4HLhLaa	Well I think you should take a break from mascara and later on try a diff brand  I mean some mascara is made of bat poop lol|`|f109adbf9f4f753c794d6f6ed6f30a1faa	Um not sure if this will be very helpful but look up the skin deep cosmetics database. http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/    try looking up the mascara you use currently. they might already have a page on it. if not, you can use it to check the safety of ingredients in your makeup and a lot of other stuff. obviously your eyelashes shouldn't be falling out, so there might be something harmful in there. the database also has lists of the safest makeups so there might be a mascara in there that you can try. i would definitely stop using the one that caused this.|`|GQ7eWcWXaa	I'm just taking a guess here, but i don't think your eyelashes fell off:) It was probably just clumps of the mascara. I had the same feeling, when I looked in the mirror i thought my eyelashes fell off, but it's because im so used to having long, think black eyelashes. Don't worry about it, and if they did fall off it won't take long for them to grow back. I suggest just lay off a little on the mascara, you can still use it, but just one coat of the whit and 2 of the black. Also, if you are sceptical about it (still not sure) then I would try a new mascara hun:), better safe then sorry. Ease up on it for a bit. Hope I helped:)|`|t26ctJdraa	waterproof mascara made mine fall out! so i just used normal mascara and worked w wat i had. it seemed to take 4 ever to grow out. just wear ur makeup as u always do. just switch to another kind

1d02e8c6d67c12c5dbe96eb8f1612081aa	How old are you?   First of all you need to ask your beauticiain. Its beetter to have that done professionally.  I am black, and I have done everying u are NOT supposed to do to your hair.  I am 33 so I been there and done just about all of that. ( not the jeri curl yuck ha ha) I have what people refur to as "mixed people" hair grade, if I can say that without being rude. You know how people are LOL.  My mom relaxed my hair at a young age. So My hair doesnt like not having a relaxer. I am just letting you know get someone that KNOWS what they are doing. It may cost a little bit, but your hair is important. You save up and treat yourself. Having your hair relaxed does not mean its going to be straight all the time either. You need to use the right hair products on it to keep it conditoned well, because a relaxer's chemicals are a bit harsh to the hair and may make it a little drier than you are used to. However, speak to a licenced cosmotologist because they will know what your hair grade ( everyone's diffrent) requires. I still use a flat iron after a blowdry. So you see, it depends.  Ask about Super relaxer and regular, because they have diffrent strengths in them. Some people use the kits at the store, but you may want to just save your little money and get it done by a professional. Even if the professonal licened person is a friend, or family member that wont charge you..Do you see what I mean?  I Hope whatever you choose that you feel good about yourself :)  THATS the important thing.  hugs PS wavey hair is extra cute. ROCK what u got! You can always lay that stuff flat in a ponytail with some moose and gel if you are feeling like not doing it at all :)|`|uDLTAw8Taa	Use garner frutis replace spit end shampoo and condition, use conair hair designer then put low ponytail next day then use float iron.|`|NGHajxLKaa	Don't relax your hair!!! I've been down that road before and it isn't pretty. If you relax your hair your options will be: straight or frizzy. And even if you do get one, you will still have to use a flat iron every now and then. Also, it will leave your hair dramatically thinner and dryer.
yqKi9l9laa	leave your hair curly and gel it, straighten your bangs so that they swoop to the side of your face. chances are, even if you don't love you natural hair, everyone else will.    there are a couple of pictures on this website, but the very bottom hair style looks best. even though her hair is blonde, it will work for both brunettes and blondes.|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	if you're hair is naturally wavy/curly, you can try scrunching your hair and keeping your bangs straight. i guess straightening might look a bit better but scrunching always works if you're looking for a quick fix after a shower.|`|4h1ET8aYaa	if you had a pic i would be able to give u a better answer.  i love curly hair.|`|xfRoZF9Qaa	hmmm.. try just putting gel in it and making it WAY curly.. and then tie it up poofy to the side or low. or even leave it down|`|HSXLzwE1aa	With your type of hair, Using either velcro or plastic rollers will give you a huge variety of different styles!  This yahoo group has tons of pictures of the latest hairstyles and new pictures are being added all the time.  It takes a little patience becasue there are so many pictures.

4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	I think its about 10-12 months or so. If you want to be sure. Google that same question for your answer.
fMLBPUVeaa	yea it does|`|MONbNUmkaa	i've had the same thought.  threw it out and bought some este lauder
63jMnc0qaa	you don't need expensive foundation to get good coverage. you should go to a drug store and try different ones out, i know people say to test on your neck, but go without any makeup on and try different ones on your cheeks and see what works for you. if you're worried about getting break outs from the makeup, go for an oil-free foundation. if you have oily skin, try to go for a whipped foundation, rather than a liquid one. if you've got dry skin, def go for liquid. i find maybelline and revlon foundations work the best but it really depends on your skin tone. neutrogena has a foundation which contains salicylic acid (prevents breakouts), but you really have to go and test them out to see what you like! hope this helps!|`|myVECzQZaa	have you tried avon makeup? It works great and it reasonable!|`|3mQPQen5aa	http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...|`|0haWIfVMaa	It's not the cheapest but Sephora foundation and their compact power is totally worth it. I have fair skin and a stupid blush that's constantly in my cheeks so I search high and low for a good makeup. Most of them look orange on me because I'm so light but Sephora's makeup doesn't do that to me. On a budget I really like Almay's foundation.|`|SBZOVEueaa	you need a green concealer stick    physicians formula has one    green cancels out the red -     use a little bit then foundation as normal and you will see a great difference
X5Qzk78maa	well 4.0 is not even close to good enough, i have a 4.8 and really high sat scores and did all the things similiar to you but i worked in a hospital for 3 years, i want to be a biomedical engineer. i had my harvard interview yesterday and cornell one today and the questions they asked me would certainly not fit with ur reccs, step up ur game!|`|bjvZZ3DGaa	What do you want to do later in life? Have an extracurricular activity that shows you are getting an early start. If you want to be a doctor (sorry, I know it's cliche, but it's the easiest example) volunteer at a hospital. Don't just haul around flowers and teddy bears, do real things if you actually volunteer. Start a club at your school that involves the students going to a hospital and volunteering.   As far as GPA goes, sorry to break it to you but middle school does not matter. What matters is your ability to mantain a GPA of 4.0 or higher by taking AP courses, if your school offers them. Also, get VERY well acquainted with your teachers. Befriend at least two so that they can write recommendations for you.   You have a lot of activities, but none of them strike me as things that show what you are interested in. So I think what you just have to do, as I've stated before, is work on getting involved with what you want to do later in life.   Best of luck to you!|`|ttm9VZL1aa	bang ur teachers and get a 5.0|`|88RC9jsUaa	If you want to push yourself harder academically see if your school has different academies. Specialized learning and diplomas are impressive to universitys. Like IB or VAPA. Also try AP or advanced placement classes. And do some charitable work other than church related. as much diversity is most valuable, universities like well rounded students.
FJIgKzzKaa	seriously dude, why do you keep asking about socks, thats like negative 23975438965 points for you|`|igrdohopaa	Ankle dude!|`|Nxvkwz3Baa	depends what shoes you wear with the socks.... I generally prefer longer ankle socks..
4hNRTWtDaa	Depends on what kind of clothes you wear, I suppose.  Do you want it hidden ALL the time, or show it sometimes?  I have 2.  One is on my upper arm, on my shoulder muscle, and the other is on my upper back over my right shoulder blade.  Both are easily hidden, but I can also show them if I wear a tank top.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I would hide it under my bed. No, just kidding. I would hide in on my shoulder so I could show it off with a tank top or hide it with a tshirt.|`|W7UpXXQGaa	my sis got hers on her hip so my parents wouldn't find out|`|HbZGe23naa	your foot|`|4971857875f57116cbbe1c9b012b72c2aa	I work in an industry where my tats can't show. You can do your upper arms, chest, and or back. Mine are on my upper arms so that it is easily covered.
qOKFuXfLaa	replace your eyelash curler sponge tip or plastic (whatever it is), your mascara and everyday eyeliner ...    with your shadows, my doctor said it was ok to grab a kleenex tissue and clean a layer off (kind of like swiping your shadow 2 times) to get rid of any kind of bacteria.     don't share your eyeliner, mascara and eyelash curler with anyone because you can catch pink eye again or you can pass it to someone else|`|GMdSbJV3aa	Unfortunately viral problems can not be cleaned by antibacterial cleansers because they are designed to kill bacteria. Viruses are not easily killed and can live on longer than bacteria. Since eyeshadow is s porous it can hold different bacteria and viruses. For normal everyday bacteria wiping it down would work but unfortunately, you're going to hate to hear this, but yes you need to throw the eye shadows out. You Need To Get Rid Of The Eye shadows! If not you are seriously risking pink eye again or other infections. It sucks, i know, but its a health issue. You shouldn't have been wearing eye makeup while you had pink eye in the first place.|`|tx8iEBgAaa	Yes the mascara and curler HAS TO GO!    but I would just wipe off the shadow... wipe it a couple of times though to get more than just one layer off..... I mean dig a litte, ok so you're losing so but its better than throwing it all away!!! =)    if it reoccures then everything would have to go.... hope not though... MAC stuff is quite an investment... go luck with that!!!     =)|`|Vf0bmaVGaa	I wouldn't take a chance. Throw away anything that might be contaminated.|`|fYox2mwGaa	yeah... you should  I wouldn't take a chance with that...  Better to be safe than sorry... you don't want to reinfect yourself, do you?|`|DfgHAPAwaa	ehh, i think you'll be fine, its just shadow. its not getting in your eye or anything anyway. MAC is expensive. lol|`|yFL2aHi3aa	yeah viral cant come back like bacterial...umm just to be safe i would throw it away....you're only supposed to use powdered makeup for up to 7 months-1 year anyways......if it's cream eyeshados definitely throw them away...hope that helps...
12AXZJl9aa	should go a little blonder if you are dying or getting streaks,but if your not getting streaks I really love your natural color as wellas for the haircut I think this would be a really cute haircut on you: http://www.short-hair-styles-magazine.co...    hope your haircut goes well :)|`|CNotcjbaaa	I wish my hair was naturally curly :    Here is a good one!

IRH71dwIaa	Try oil sheen, my favorite is the olive oil kind.  It is light, non-greasy and makes your hair silky smooth. You can buy it at any store that sell hair supplies.
ZOOjdv7Waa	let's just say that guy is very lucky to put his arm around you.|`|PwDWfgiNaa	you seem like a really nice person. and really approachable.

But an overall good person though|`|es3feuhxaa	you seem like you would be nice and outgoing  btw you and your boyfriend are so cute!|`|eX8i4vwRaa	you are really pretty!  if you want advise, i would make your eyebrows thinnner and give them more shape.  just let the salon do it for you.  it will make you complete lol  i hope you listen cause thats like really the only thing wrong with you and then you will be gorgeous.  i dont lie :)|`|9JCmbQOhaa	foreign(as in you have an interesting ethnic background)  friendly  and silly|`|NYSPPrKRaa	You seem nice.

And by the way, guys aren't all about big boobs and crap like that. I personally like women with not-so-stick-out boobs.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	thATS not fat my sister weights that much and she looks skinny except her tummy and im not a guy but w/e peace:P|`|3sCrTA1Raa	no  dont  worry  about it|`|hDAoKmjPaa	that is not fat at all. i know im not a guy but i just wanted to answer|`|3Z4YFz29aa	no, and smaller boobs look better on shorter girls|`|EuwGku8vaa	You sound possibly a bit overwieght for your height but I don't think your fat at all.. Actually you sound pretty normal in weight, hoped that helped!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Why do you need a guys opinion. If you lose weight yes there is a chance they may get smaller because you breast is fat and what you are trying to lose is also fat. Another thing, you are at the correct weight for your height. How do I know, because I am also 5"3 and 130 pounds. I am not fat, I wish I was a little taller though. I don't worry about losing weight, I am more focused on eating right and building muscle than losing fat. I also don't want to lose my breast size neither.
77qHoaIUaa	Go to the beach! Put on a medium spf sunscreen so you will tan slightly, but you will get the protection and go often. I'd say that about twice a week will make you pretty tan by the end of the summer. If you don't live where there is a beach, find a pool that you can go to and lie out and relax by. Bring a book or go with friends, time will fly and you will be getting darker [:|`|IeZkqmIQaa	Just hang out with your friends outside in the sun. PLay basketball or something that has to do with outside.
pln8UqcMaa	Ebay's good, etsy's good.

iGZWeWwBaa	i'm not sure what you look like, but,     a dress like:  http://images.starpulse.com/pictures/200...    and a hairstyle like   http://www.teenidols4you.com/blink/Actor... is great|`|8EHRjT0uaa	where a cute flirty dress and if you have curly hair then straighten it and vic versa.|`|xWOL0vWEaa	For your hair tease it then you should do curls with your extra hair.  Wear a dress  a pretty one but not to like extravagent.|`|OB2JbmFcaa	Outfits:  1) http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/partytrousout...   You could add a mini white/gold jacket because then it won't give such a fancy look    2) http://www.catwalkqueen.tv/overdresspart...   But I think this outfit's shoes looks ugly; you could find a pair of heels anywhere, so I wouldn't worry about that, but the sweater gives the dress a very comfortable look!    3) http://girldir.com/files/images/weekend-...   This one is very casual, but the pants gives a sorta nerdy look, so I say get a skirt the same color as the pants but a plaid one with dark grey and pink plaids in them; it'll be so cute!    Well, those are some of the ones I looked up! Good luck~
x7sOwhNdaa	that dress is way cute.   well there are many things you can do in this sorta problem.  A] wear leggings under to cover the bare skin  but if you can still see the butt cheeks  B] rather than attaching another piece to it  add aNOTHER layer of tighter closer to skin tulle underneath.  make sure the colors compliment each other in color and style,and pattern.   C. go to a pro and ask for help.  having them do it costs quite a bit  so just ask for advice and DIY   hope i helped  if ya wuna noe more hitt me up

This website states in New Mexico the law is:  H) No person shall perform any body art upon  a person under the age of 18 years without the written  consent of a parent or legal guardian. The written  consent must be kept on the premises at the body art  establishment. The parent or legal guardian does not  have to stay at the body art establishment during the  entire body art procedure as long as the parent or  legal guardian provides written and notarized consent  to the specific planned procedure(s) to the body art  establishment prior to the procedure(s). If the  parent or legal guardian remains present during the  body art procedure, the written consent does not have  to be notarized. Written consent shall be personally  delivered to the body art establishment by the parent  or legal guardian; delivery by the person under  18 years of age is not sufficient. Photographic  identification of the parent or legal guardian is  required. Nothing in this section is intended to  require an operator to perform any body art on a  person under 18 years of age with or without parental  or guardian consent.    TRANSLATION: Your mom would have to go with you and sign a piece of paper and hang out with you while you got it done. But the tattoo parlor can tell you no to tattooing you if they feel like it.

3WItFAwlaa	Go to any Clinique counter.  You can get a FREE consultation.  They will make personal suggestions for you.  I started using the soap, moisturizer, and toner at about your age.      When my neice moved from her mother's house to my brother's, her skin was a mess.  I took her to Clinque.  Her skin was beautiful within a month.  It is hands down the best product for teen skin.  It is expensive but worth it.  Using moisturizer will not make you breakout.    And as a woman in her 40's, I can tell you that moisturizer is your friend.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Uhmm no Clinique is very high quality makeup.  Its good for your skin, trust me.|`|HbZGe23naa	it wouldnt ruin it but it might give you a break out. your skin at that age is very oily so the extra moisture would be a great playground for the bacteria that cause a break out.

Yours might be different.|`|zsBWa3wGaa	if you make a habit of using it early on, it'll disrupt your skin's natural oils and etc, especially if you haven't gone through the greasy puberty skin phases yet... you shouldn't use it if it's not absolutely necessary, and if it is you're probably doing something wrong|`|672b5656d0344c959a7f6892a55f88ecaa	for a 12yr old u only need a 3step and an eyecream. there's no point wasting money.

YZFk1Eu4aa	You are a bit of a shortie girly!! Anyways I am now a model, I did the course, gost my photo shoot for my portfolio and should be put on te internet as a model for the agency I am accepted to sometime next week. I am 168cm tall and I am a shortie compeared to most of the other models. I have looked through the profiles of the ther models in the agency I am accepted into and most of them are 6 foot which is really tall for a girly. You look quite average, but you do have a trim lil body which is very good. I'd sugest you go to your local agency and request an interview, there are models who have larger noses, so just try. Even though you have quite an average looking face your bone structure is quite good, so just give its a go. :]|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	Im sorry, but your just too short.  Girls generally have to be atleast 170cm if they want to model.  You could probably get into promotions modelling.  Its not worth the $5,000 nose job on the off chance that you may beconme a model. Your a pretty girl and your dress is hot, but sorry just not model material.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	yeah you are pretty.|`|zfPH6LmBaa	love the dress. and that pink limo is cool    why would u wanna be a model?  anywho ur too far away for me to see. but ur nose does look a little big.. not that much|`|2wOmBTPyaa	You don't need a nose job. There are alot of models with bigger noses and they got famous that way without plastic surgery.|`|RyIFqmVEaa	no|`|OHfZFR31aa	Your nose isn't a problem. it's your height. You won't even be considered unless you are 174cm.|`|8MVrUtbAaa	yes, definately. And you're gorgeous if that means anything lol  xoxo!|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I'm not really sure which one you are, but I narrowed it down to 3. Either way, every single girl in that picture is gorgeous :)|`|wSMYGzrQaa	You don't need a nose job. Yes, you could be a model|`|OfHoaWf7aa	You look just fine the way you are. Sometimes smaller noses look funny, especially when it's a nose job. Embrace what you've been blessed with and enjoy!|`|654d5146948b9a667ab1e0b36ce93e3eaa	hey hun - you are hot!! to be honest i think if your nose bothers you then get a nose job  - dont just get it becasue you want to be a model as to get into the modelling industry is hard - expecially to be succesful becasue every pretty girl out there wants to be a model - maybe join an agency and get there opinions or just see how you go  - if alot of clients tell you your nose is a problem and thats really the only thing stopping you then go for it if thats what your dream is to be..    good luck darling  XOXOX|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Why not do some modeling around town, there must be some fashion shows, to see how you are received. How about entering a pageant? Put yourself out there. You may find just the way you are, WORKS!!|`|GUf19aZ4aa	a closer look at yer face would be better but YES YOU COULD DEFINITELY BE A MODEL!!  yer gorgeous and beautiful.|`|SqnUEyhEaa	the yellow dress? your gorgeous, trying to boost your confidence? you have a nice nose. i mean you'll probably look weird if you got a nose job. and dude. have you ever seen what goes on when your asleep? they like break it and ugh..just nastiness  -bee|`|ohj5sRpsaa	i love the dress!    you don't need a nose job.|`|50Ia20yXaa	who says you need a nose job!?!?! u are pretty and in case you havent noticed, you dont necessarily have to be pretty to get into the business so you would probably help all of us|`|8dwccuUbaa	you are really pretty! i don't see you as a model though. maybe. you don't need a nose job though.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	you don't need a nosejob! you're pretty already.|`|U77NlQXpaa	idk about the model. it seems to me that it doesn't matter how pretty you are. I don't think that a lot of high fashion models are that pretty. You might not be tall enough, but who knows you could grow:)  about the nose though. don't change it. its not big just different. it makes you look foreign.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	You are gorgeous! And you don't need a nose job. In fact, nowadays, the more popular models are unique looking, and your nose could make you look unique. That almost betters your chance of becoming a model. However, I don't think your nose is too big. I think it makes you look even prettier. I don't know. Just my opinion. (:
6q9K8vRRaa	I have the same skin as you.  To help your acne, I recommend oil free products  and something that has at least (2% salicylic acid (option))  For liquid foundation I would use something very light so  it wouldnt feel cakey on my skin.  A great liquid foundation is the Maybelline New York puremakeup  foundation. It is 50% water and wont clog your pores. Sorry I dont know the price but you can find it at a drugstore : )  Ive been using it for a year and I haven't gotten any breakouts from it.  A powder I am using now is the Almay Clear Complexion Press Powder. This makes your skin look less oily. Also, I haven't gotten any breakouts from it. Its in a yellow compact and has a mirror and also and a pad.  I bought it for $12    Hope this helps!|`|MONbNUmkaa	I use maybelline with cornsilk translucent powder and a sponge for day to day and save the really good stuff for going out.  If you invest in bare minerals, you can do without all kinds of stuff because it does it all.  It is light, oil-free, and covers scars(I have scars).  When you put it on just brush a little more over just the scars and they disappear.

If you do it like I said, it won't be crunchy or hard or anything nasty like that, either. :P|`|0FktuJjeaa	Im not sure but maybe you could try putting it in a ponytail high on your head after you shower. Oh and its a good thing that you're not blow drying your hair because overtime it can make your hair dry + limp. I used to use it and it thinned my hair out.|`|kw11UCFqaa	ANSWER MY QUESTION PLEASEEEEEEEE I NEED HELPPPPPP|`|WdtJaNdEaa	You should always use a thermal protection spray before using heat products. You can find a cheap one at your local drugstore.    Use volumising mousse on damp hair. You can also go to bed with a high ponytail, although it might give you an unsexy bump where the hair band was in the morning.|`|AA11563243	when your hair is wet, pull it up into a tight high bun or ponytail to add volume. the bun will give it a bit of a wave, if that's also what you are looking for.

But... if you get them sewed in then they last way longer, and you can wash your hair to..    hope this helped    O and p.s.

5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	Go to the place you are going to go your tat from and talk to the tattoo artist. Tell him/her what you are wanting and have them design something for you! That way it's unique, most places don't mind doing this!     I got my first tattoo in November and just out of a whim when we were leaving wal-mart I decided I was getting on so we went to the local tat place. I told the guy what I have always wanted (that being a cross) and told him that recently I thought about getting a cancer ribbon in memory of my grandpa that lost his battle with cancer and in honor of my 2 grandma's that won their battles. It was great he designed the tat with everything I wanted and it was totally original! I LOVE IT and it means so much to me!|`|8THz1sp9aa	deviantart.com   type in search: 'tattoo flash' 'tattoo designs' 'tattoo' or specific tattoos example: heart tattoo, etc.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	I tried looking for tattoo online but was dissapointed with everything i found.

Your hair needs natural curl to it to scrunch it. try washing your hair at night and using foam curlers (wait till hair's 80 percent dry and leave them in all night) That's the only way my hair will hold curl.
aqSwIuZ5aa	I have heard of people having their eyebrow piercing reject quite easily.     I have had mine for 6 years now and it has no signs of rejecting at all.     Most of time piercing reject b/c of irritation. I never play with mine and keep the same bar in all the time.     So yes i do think its possible.

8qHiM3Kyaa	NO! they are NOT scary!   i thought that they would be scary too   and im really pale so i was nervous   but just go in for a short amount of time the first time   and then go in more as you get more comfortable!  and its kind of small in there and gets boring but they play music for you so to pass the time i always just dance the whole time to   not think about it! (:|`|x5R1zUtraa	Yes. Tanning beds are horrific. They lock you in this tanning both with a really heavy duty lock, and wait until your skin is ready to go. Then once they let you out (I don't know 1 day later) Your skin is beat red. Then slowly it fades to a good tanning colour.|`|OUBKWrf2aa	It aint scary, Its fake!      funny how ppl want to have their skin red and its fake lol|`|6PMGheWxaa	nope! i actually think the lay down ones are scarier  lol but neither are scary! :)|`|RZ4dpbrJaa	its not scary ha|`|D8nyS1Rfaa	I will definitely NOT lecture you on tanning.  I want to congratulate you on realizing that moderate tanning will give you vitamin D which will prevent internal cancer and melanoma.  Yes, prevent melanoma!  Good for you!    Stand up units are much more space, you just have to stand.  You don't get that relaxing feeling.  But they are usually faster and in and out very easy.    Have fun!|`|akUNFagyaa	nope not at all,  i like them better than lay down. since theres no gap or anything like a lay day i feel like im getting a better tan cause the light doesnt have now where to go but on my body. ha thats just my theory though.|`|vD7AAkUFaa	Christop is wrong about saying tanning beds are good, you need sun, but that means around thirty mins are day just outside, not even necassarily when its sunny, and tanning beds use hight uv rays.|`|xZo4wP6Faa	all tanning beds scare me, have you seen final destination 3?
VJQaZHmLaa	don't use to much chemicals on your face if you dont have a major problem take it from me iv used cheap stuff to $500 stuff and my doctor recommended cetaphil,wash with it day and night and dab benzac on the spots you get this from a chemist and there are different strenghts get the strongest one because the others dont work that well you might not need to even misturise if you do try biotherm gel and ask for advise from biotherm consultant|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	you should probably ask your doctor to recommend something.

VjqEi5wZaa	I don't really like the idea. I mean, it's awesome that I'll be able to afford some of it now and all, but it seems like he's selling out and going mainstream. I feel like if he makes a line for Target then he'll just be one more regular designer you know. Like it won't be as special, and it'll take away something from him as a designer.    BTW: I am not a rich snob, I couldn't afford anything of his that's regular in a million years so don't say that I am. I just think fashion is special.|`|eDEX8TUVaa	iDK.. i hadnt heard this yet... it think its a cool idea but.... he will have to b careful to remain exclusivity in hollywood.

IeZkqmIQaa	What restaurants are you looking for if it depends on your beauty. Because those restaurants are wrong for booting you. I think you look very beautiful and classy.

I wish I could find a job. But anyways don't listen to them, they may have just did that because you are asian, they lied on me and all of this stuff at my last job because I was black. Screw them is what I say and I think you should say the same. You are very pretty and seem very confident.|`|p4sXZTtFaa	It's probably a nice way of saying "You're Asian. We don't want you" because you are actually really pretty (7 or 8, close enough to 10)    Go work at a really trendy Asian fusion restaurant, coz that is probably 100x better than where you were working before.|`|fHZjRA5Saa	yur preeety!|`|n1y67ZNuaa	your pretty as love.  8/10.|`|2ISqwRpdaa	First of all u know your pretty, and I dont think they can fire someone based on how they look.|`|NYSPPrKRaa	You're super pretty!

LUVBrg3Maa	It should be, but I agree proactiv sucks. There are cheaper products on the market that work just as good.|`|qDjQYDcLaa	proactiv sucks.
k0g1qjoXaa	I don`t know the price, but you should touch-up your roots yourself, get extentions, and for a new color, get it done professionally! The boxes you buy in the stores never really come out perfectly, unless your only doing hilights! GOOD LUCK TOMORROW!|`|AA11664585	that's a little spendy, come to me!!  lol  tell her you are short on cash, and ask if she can cut it down by doing less, like your roots all over, then highlight on just top and sides.|`|YekLLS2Yaa	i would go back to your natural hair color. That's what I did when I had blonde highlights and now I love my hair.  As them to tone it to the color of your roots then dye it that color|`|NBLmYWRBaa	skip the extentions. they often look fake and cheap. just spend your money on dying ur hair dark brown, a trim to clean it up or change it up with a new style and maybe some bangs and some good quality shampoo, and conditioners, and styling products. it will look way better.|`|E2S2PX21aa	I wouldn't try to do it myself, because the hair dyes look differently on different shades of hair (there are pictures on the back of many of the boxes) A hairstylist will be able to dye all your hair the same color evenly. As for the extensions, if you have enough money for the color and the extensions, I would go for it having them professionally done is much better, however the do it yourself ones are good too, they just require a little more work.
sh1VoStgaa	I bought mine at Kohls, or try Walmart that is where my friend gets hers.

Or if you don't have those stores either you can always order the shirts off the one of their sites.

5573832243a1d5e3f002d23bed5be490aa	Unfortunatly you are probably just going to have to let it grow out!     Perming could really damage your hair, then you'll have a BIG problem! Definatly go talk to your hair dresser and she what she recommends!    Sorry, there is not quick fix to this! Good Luck!|`|ReGhCqgVaa	Do NOT get a perm. You will completely ruin your hair.    The best thing to do is to talk to a hair stylist. They will give you advice on how to get your natural hair back.    Avoid styling your hair as much as possible.    Use deep conditioner once or twice a week.    My advice, just deal with your hair for now and wait for it to grow back. It's the healthiest thing to do.|`|KGrMMAOaaa	yah trying a perm like your old natural hair  sounds good while its growing out. atleast now you know not to try it again lol|`|M0mVCl4Uaa	dude ur gonna damage ur hair if u keep on doin this artificial **** to it|`|TprIqGhCaa	All you can do is let it grow out...getting a perm could possibly make your hair a completely different texture then it started out as.|`|Fg5AWkIYaa	Awe I'm scared of getting mine permanantly straightened...

In the meantime, straighten the top to match the ends.      The straight part is straight forever, so just slowly trim it off.  Sorry!|`|1cUJ441Laa	i think you just need to let it grow out. good luck!!|`|YVd79cbraa	i wouldnt get a perm because they normally look unatural after you get the straightener put in.  you could try cutting it.  good luck :)|`|wK5k435Waa	thats nasty. how did you straiten your hair without burning your legs. you should just shave. its more pleasant. then your pants dont bulge out and knock people over. youre gross. you should be called weeping willow.|`|rxkyHHUtaa	you should probably talk to your hairdresser and see what can be done about that, or what you should do. You could get a curly perm. I mean there are a lot of different perms out there (curls, spiral, ringlet) you might even be able to get it like your natural hair, BUT since your hair is fine and it was permanently straightened, it might dry out your hair a lot and ruin it. But I really think you should talk to a hairdreser, they might be able to give you WAY better advice than on yahoo =)|`|AA11664585	I would defiantly not suggest getting a perm, its kind of like to wrongs dont make a right, and like trying to straighten a piece of hair you just curled. but it will relax more within a year to a year and a half, so hang in there, and wait. It doesn't sounds good but that's about all. =(|`|lyrS9wSuaa	you have to let it grow out if you put a perm on it it could break of. straighteners and perms don't mix. two different chemicals are used can't mix them. not a good idea at all.|`|2ApZPB8gaa	I don't know much about the permanent straightening thing, I don't know how...strong the straightness is, but is it possible to just have a shower tilt your head upside down and hair spray it while scrunching it? As for your permanent hair back, I guess you'll just have to wait for it to grow out and know better next time that you like it. (:|`|GLnQY91qaa	All I can say is next time, just buy a Chi flat iron. That way you can choose whenever you want it straight, or natural.|`|a0f80a327fcf6b505541bf1ca4e04140aa	i wouldnt suggest getting a perm cuz itll mess up your hair  honestly just let it grow out and if you could do it, which i doubt, just shave it all off and let it grow out again, it really helps out and strengthens your hair n makes it look really nice.  idk, its kinda bizzare but its really good|`|AA10225658	If you perm your hair it will become dry and rough and lose luster. If the hair is neither straight nor curly, trim it (it will make your hair a little curlier) and give it time to come back to normal.

LUVBrg3Maa	I have actually heard of this, older people are said to have used pumice stones to exfoliate and remove hair on their legs. You would have to be gentle though, I would assume.|`|9de68204fb68bbbc0e10fc5b9880ed2eaa	Sandpaper works great too.|`|ynKunWheaa	Does it really work?|`|EXNdGyLtaa	Emory boards shouldn't be used on your face... that's weird. Just get an exfoliator....|`|usb9nzJjaa	get clean and clear facial scrubs or make something nautral at home look up natural remedies.|`|s67BloUxaa	try an electric angle grinder
tx8iEBgAaa	ok I'm a nail tech and this happens a lot!!!    It is just what happens when the nail has not had exposure to the sun... or light for that matter... don't freak out its normal...    1. keep painting your nails no one will see  2. no nail polish, let the sun get to them and your body will turn them white again.      this usually happens with toenails but don't worry its fine.... if they turn green see a doc thats infection, but other than that ur fine!!!! =)|`|HvxKb4gIaa	dont paint them for awhile. let them grow out!|`|LwerCk42aa	It's not from painting the to much, its from leaving the polish on to long. So just don't paint ur nails for about a 3 or 4 weeks.|`|iTKhQKdBaa	try this. http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...|`|P6SpWWHraa	This is a natural chemical reaction of your nails to the polish. In fact, pregnant women are discouraged from painting their nails. In more extreme cases, it might feel painful on your nails if you do not paint them (the nails are too weak and damaged that they feel painful to be exposed).  You cannot reverse the reaction, and so damaged nails can not be whitened. Only thing to do is to let new nails grow back.|`|50Ia20yXaa	ok so that happened to me but all it takes i u have to just let them relax. it took maybe two days for them to go back to normal. nail polish is chemical so u definatly do not want to make get them infected while trying to make them look pretty|`|9JzsDSB1aa	lol  chill  the same thing happened to me  just let them grow out  and paint them with clear nail polish that promotes strength and growth.  sally hansen sell good products.  you can find it at your local drug store like walgreens or kmart or wal mart target...etc|`|xZo4wP6Faa	i have kept my toenails painted since i was 12-13. i'm 22 now and my toenails always have a slight yellow tint. it's never really noticeable, especially since they are always painted-i'm the only one who ever sees them bare.  if yours are really yellow, let them breathe for a few days, and start using a base polish before you put on your regular polish. a coat between should help keep the yellow from coming back, at least a little, and your nail polish will stay on longer.|`|b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	Your nails must breathe like your skin, the nail polish seals them from doing so .
TprIqGhCaa	Chemically straighten it...and even then, you'll have to use some heat to get it 100% straight.|`|SGcALN2uaa	well although it is difficult to straighten your hair without heat it is not impossible. first of all start out with shampoo and conditioner specially made for straight hair, then you can get a hairdryer with a cold button (conair makes a bunch) and blow dry it cold and with a round brush. hope this helped : )|`|8qHiM3Kyaa	straitening shampoos an conditioners
IW6GEWRsaa	Wet and wild would definitely break you out most likely  and there color range isn't very good  well if you want it for cheaper get it at walmart  because at drug stores would be more expensive|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i would not trust wet and wild foundation or any of their stuff that goes on your face(lip stuff and eyeliner is ok tho) i tried it ONE time and i broke out super bad.  foundation is the one makeup product you should spend a little more money on, it will defiantly be worth it when your skin is not broken out|`|myVECzQZaa	NO WET N WILD please.. Its ok to use the lip liners or even the gloss, but the makeup is horrible.. i mean i understand that you want a bargin but this is not the way. have u tried Avons makeup.. its great and it very reasonable to.. they have mineral makeup for only 7.99 and some other liquid foundations on sale. if  you need more info u can email me K.    p.s. please no wet n wild...|`|AA11051531	agree with "imsobeautiful86"...dont use the foundation~ i would recommend revlon~      http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Pro...        Or somthing mineral try https://www.everydayminerals.com/  you can order a free sample kit, the foundation is just wonderfull        hope i helped~|`|tGZqtBNLaa	Wet and wild lip gloss is about the only product I will use from them. I use revlon and I definitely think its worth the 14 dollars.|`|Q7SIRZbLaa	NO!|`|SBZOVEueaa	you get what you pay for    yes, the revlon colorstay is worth it    if you look in the sunday sale papers you can get great deals    2 weeks ago there was a revlon coupon AND cvs had a buy one get one free on revlon foundations    otherwise just pay the 14 dollars and wear the confidence in a quality foundation|`|5LC3txiTaa	Color stay is defiantly the way to. I used wet and wild products and I broke out with zits!|`|6S8Ycs85aa	Mary Kay has great Foundation and is worth the price , and the other great thing  If for any reason you are not completely satisfied with any Mary Kay? product, it will be replaced without charge, exchanged or the full purchase price refunded, for more information contact me.|`|9dyPKI9Vaa	Mary Kay is a very good brand.   its $14 a tube and totally worth it. think about it...anything at walgreens is about 7-12 dollars anyways...not much more youre spending..  try loooking on ebay for marykay foundation if you cant find a dealer. you could get it for like 5 bucks of youre lucky.
qzkWahFeaa	You could get green/purple/yellow hoop earrings and bangles, as well as one of those long scarves.|`|k0g1qjoXaa	Try some fun accessories, such as big bracelets, long necklaces, earrings, colorful shoes, ect.!|`|r1UQZTjraa	awwh man that sucks!  mines navy blue grey pants or white shirt,  we usually wear coloured tank tops underneath our shits and thow them through the bottom,   we also wear lots of jewelery, like hair bows and bracelets  :D|`|ujuY7pPZaa	bright colored chunky necklaces.. and earrings. Head bands, accessories in hair... cute shoes.. bright shoes... heals.. there is so much you can do|`|3sCrTA1Raa	necklace  scarves socks  belts bracelets|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Just make sure you don't go too over the top. I remember girls at my old work would try and accessorize but they would just do it too much and it didn't look professional. I would say go for simple things, and don't wear too much at once. And if it's something a little  more out there, wear it on its own with no other accessories. The last thing you want is to be in trouble from your bosses about it.   Maybe a few beaded necklaces. Simple bangles or bracelets. Belts which can go around your waist or under the breast area. Loose silky scarves.
KVaW8R48aa	sweet pea of course|`|VLO7e4tMaa	Cucumber melon!!!  It makes me feel happy and calm.

BB3RcWwZaa	Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but they both look a little worse than average. I'd say break all ties with them and restart your life with more attractive friends.    Edit: I like the way the pic in the notes looks though. How about a half decent pic though, no more of this MySpace ****. If you're asking for our analyses, you might as well provide decent pics of yourself... People tend to assume you're ugly when essentially all you can see is one eye and a mouth.|`|PFBKuVhBaa	are they the same person?  i say 1st|`|qDjQYDcLaa	neither|`|8MVrUtbAaa	oh wowie, i hope you're the first one. The second one has ALOT to work on.. ugh.. the first one is a ton prettier...  xoxo|`|ZOOjdv7Waa	they're very similar, on the same level.   On a side note, I prefer judging on school pictures. they give you a frontal view of the face.|`|wyCJ365oaa	First girl is the prettiest.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	They're both gorgeous   But I would say the first one :)|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I think they both are pretty and I am being honest. I wouldn't be honest if I choose between the two.|`|TprIqGhCaa	The first one.|`|k0j3phebaa	the first one.|`|IeZkqmIQaa	I like the first one. But the second one got really nice eyes, she just needs to brush her teeth more.|`|Afmv2WYSaa	first one is better|`|NVSambhPaa	I would say both are about average, and both look alike.    "i just always think people like her are prettier than me and stuff. weird i know"    That quote from what you wrote seems pretty messed up. Why is that weird? And I'm sure you think that you are prettier than her, you just want people to tell you. Kind of sad if you ask me.|`|bOduFl9Baa	uhm idk if this helps but i would rate you the same|`|2WJQmnKzaa	the first needs more natural looking hair, and the second needs to invest in some Differin , DuAc, or ProActive.|`|9hLEo32Iaa	First.  The 2nd has really bad acne and i want to throw up.|`|UmobeP5Saa	yall are both hot but id have to go with the second one....she just seems more....i dunno.....natural?|`|5OUdZhLHaa	i think the 2nd one is prettier because if the 1st one had no make-up on she would be a lot less pretty than the 2nd.
W4VhsZFTaa	well i have my tongue done.  thats why i was asking for opinions.  well it deff did NOT hurt at all.  until....after.  like the next 3 days.  just eat lots of ice.    i mean its your body  who cares what anyone thinks.  but i like to know still   but if you want it   go for it=]  its cute i think.  its only trashy if you use it for trashy reasons.  its a peircing and it expresses how you are.  it doesnt have to be trashy if you dont show it off.  just do it girl.  it's worth it =]|`|YLezctqpaa	Ehhh, Tongue piercings HURT.  It's gonna be hard to talk, Eat.   And you're so young, Think about your  future, If you had kids, Would you let them  have a piercing at such an illegal age?   And It could get infected!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Read up about it on bmezine.com It is such a great site, people post their own experiences about their piercings and there are a lot of pictures and reviews.|`|0PEVAuIkaa	That's cool but people will think you did it for sexual reasons.  That's why I didn't get one.|`|tFIS2HbVaa	it's gonna be really hard eating for the first week... lol. after that, it's okay. Oh, and don;t take out the tongue ring for longer than about 2 hours because the hole closes really easily... even if you've had it for a really long time.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	go get it,  it did not hurt at all, just a little poke. its kinda hard to talk at first, i felt like i was talking like a super lisp but all my friends said they could not tell at all, so chances are people wont notice. and its hard to eat for the first few days,so stock up on ice cream/popscicles, soup,and mashed potatoes and stuff. i ate soft things but by the end of the week i was back to eating normal foods, it just took longer to eat and now i am eating perfectly normal ( i just got mine done like a week and a half ago.) alsoo mix listerine with water and rinse with that after you eat anything.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	Ughh, don't get your tongue done, thats hideous.|`|FqRxiHnTaa	Well, if you really want your tongue, then go ahead! But it might look like a little too much and not to mention the pain. But seriously, do whatever you want!|`|rHhtn7plaa	just go to somewhere that's very clean and they no what there doing so you won't have to get your tongue cut off cause they messed it up and you get a infection. you'll talk funny|`|KMy4b77naa	My cousin got it done. Go to a nice place, infection can lead to surgical action. Don't get a super-huge hole, don't pierce to far back, and make sure you get a nice, round, silver ball. Gold looks tacky and tastes awful, and any shape other than a perfect sphere could cause upper mouth damage. Take it out when you eat.|`|sh1VoStgaa	my cousin got her tongue done and she said it hurt like an itch, and she has a high pain tolerance. but if you want it, then get it, who cares if you are only 14. it will probably get swollen and you wont be able to talk or eat for a while. && you have to be careful to not get infections, but you should know about all that already.      Just put tongue piercing into google to learn more, I always find wikipedia useful. lol.
oJQmzPahaa	wow! that sucks. first of all, don't listen to those girls...they make those comments b/c they are insecure with themselves. So what if you have skinny lips? embrace them! BUT, about the purple/blue lip...you should really see a doctor if that has been like that for 3 days.  Maybe you were allergic to it? well, stop using it and ask your doctor which one might be best for you. Try other kinds and good luck!|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You are allergic...see a Dr....|`|i98X99Q8aa	HAHAHA!!!!!!! jk    See a doctor maybe?|`|Fb11LZdOaa	ROFL!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Go to the doctors =)|`|qzkWahFeaa	You may have had an allergic reaction to something in the plumper. Or, if you had a slightly open sore it would have infected it probably. I would try a soothing cream that is safe for lips, or some ice. If nothing works, go to your doctor.    To cover it, use some lipstick that has soothing ingredients, like in chapstick and softlips. Try not to irritate your lips though.|`|KVaW8R48aa	like the girl above said you should go to the doctor and after that i would just put lip stick on that will def cover up your purple lips|`|T7vuRDCVaa	See! That's what you get skinny lips!    Just Kidding!!!!!    Anout all you can do is ice them down and wait. You gave your poor delicate lips a hickey with that machine and now it's just going to have to wear off.    I dont know why you would do such a thing. Personally I've always found delicate lips far more kissable then someone who looks like they've been punched in the mouth one too many times.|`|iTKhQKdBaa	that's what you get for reacting to "miss popular" (:    butt if its swolen i tend to put ice on everything swolen because for me it works. otherwise ask your mom if you havent already maybe an older sister or aunt? thenn go to a doctor this weekend i guess.    if its not that big then try to put a color over it to tone down the blue and purple. return the lip plumper.|`|YpoKUoInaa	thats sucks!!  you should go back to sephora and ask them what to do.|`|kmAMgkiraa	You obviously had a bad reaction. Go to the doctors asap! And return that lip plumper right away. You were better off just going to the drug store and picking up a cheaper lip plumper that won't do that to your lips. I'm so sorry hun! And next time those girls do something like that to you tell them that at east you don't have to go around making fun of people to make yourself feel better.|`|wIZid9Enaa	carp, allergic reaction. You should go to a doctor and not let annoying bitches push you around. Punch that bioch so hard it the face!!!!|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Oh...what kind of lip plumper did you get?    I would recommend DuWop's Lip Venom, as it uses natural ingredients to plump the lips.     I'm sorry, I don't know what to do in your situation.|`|P7fpW3mTaa	That so-called popular girl sounds like a giant *****.  Don't worry, she'll get hers.  Oh, and most of the super popular girls I ever knew got fat and ugly once they hit their 20's and the not so pretty girls got hotter.  hahahaha     Sorry about your lips.  Nix the stuff you bought and try some clove oil!  Put a little on your finger and dab on your lips.  Worked for me!  =]|`|nIzhk3dJaa	I highly doubt she's THAT pretty or THAT perfect. She's probably a slut-and since most guys like easy she's so popular.    don't let people like that push you around! you've got to hold your own.    for the lip problem go see a doctor as soon as possible then go back to the store and complain.    good luck :)|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	ask ur parents to take you to a doctor.    next time u want fuller looking lips, put lipstick on then some gloss.  it works really well    and next time she says that, just be like "FAT LIPS!!" lol|`|fscgp7iFaa	Hmmm IDK whats wrong but you may have had an allergic reaction. Try putting some light lipstick over your lips and then put on some gloss the camoflage the swelling it could take 1-2 weeks to get better.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	see a doctor|`|PwDWfgiNaa	sounds like an allergy i would go to sephora and complain. demand a refund and see if they can hook you up with some free makeup for all the embarrassment.
daij1eBCaa	Yes, I have some and it does pretty good! I think I need a lighter shade though, but that was my fault, not theirs. ?|`|B3h0Ixj2aa	I use it and I absolutely love it. It is really light weight and feels like wearing nothing at all.|`|C5eKUi2Xaa	I have some from a long time ago and it's pretty good. If it's your first time using a mineral makeup, then I would say to get it. It's pretty good. Especially for the price. But be careful! I'm light skinned but I'm not ivory. I'm not EXTREMELY white. So I got "light" for my color and it was sooo dark! I can't use it :( It made my face kinda red. So, you might want to get a shade that's lighter than what you think you are. Cause I'm pretty sure they run kinda on the dark side.    Also, there's a lot of powder! Will last you a long time (:|`|3b73cc5bf948386f5b508e34a099b497aa	I personally hate it.    I REALLY recommend buying Bare Minerals.  You can get it at Sephora or any department store. Its around 25 bucks and TOTALLY worth it. It even clears up your skin because its so clean.  I use it everyday and have for the past 2 years, one of these literally lasts at LEAST 6 months. And my step-mom has had the same one for over a year (she uses it less obviously)    I tried maybelline hoping it would be at least CLOSE to the same but I was totally disappointed, It looked like I put orange tinted body glimmer on my face and it didnt even conceal any blemishes.    PLEASE just save up for bare minerals! Its BEYOND worth it!|`|wdz5RMaeaa	Save your money. Buy no makeup.|`|TxV2DRpNaa	yes I do, I statred using it a few months ago, I replaced bare minerals. I think it works rather well. I deff feel so much lighter and better then when i had to cake one liquid foundation. If you need to cover a blemish or a zit, take a small eye shadow brush and and put a large ammount in that small location. And I have less zits!|`|0haWIfVMaa	It turned my face orange, but I have fair skin so that might just be unique to me.|`|ceE9aNg2aa	I love their jingle!  "Maybe she's born with it! Maybe it's Maybelline!"|`|kkO87h0Xaa	I like my own natural skin.    There is no such thing as "natural" foundation. It's all just there to cover up your so-called "flaws."    I wish people would stop being embarrassed about their own skin.
daij1eBCaa	It's been a while, probably about 5 months or so. I need to go! ?|`|qzkWahFeaa	Maybe 4 months. I'm getting one before Valentine's Day though.|`|RBNowXCVaa	end of august, I'm growing it until june!

CQz8dMzFaa	Do you have oily skin? That could be the reason. Use a toner on the eyelids if you do. Otherwise, stay away from waxy pencil liners, and get a liquid one. My personal favourite is Maybelline Line Works. It doesnt smudge even when I rub it.|`|k0g1qjoXaa	First, you have to make it smooth so that you don't have to push too hard to put it on. This may sound weird but trust me, it works! Take out a match, and burn the tip of your eyeliner. Only for a second, though, for it to melt or soften. After that wait a second, and it'll be cool again. Now the perfect amount of eyeliner will go on and it won't smear!|`|tGZqtBNLaa	I use to have that problem , I started using foundation and cover up around my eyes and some loose powder and switched to almay eyeliner and it works pretty good for me .|`|Q7SIRZbLaa	you need waterproof or eyeliner that lasts longer. and you may be sweating or something.|`|fpXQqNrqaa	First of all, you might need to buy a new eyeliner that would last longer and not smudge. To keep the eyeliner from smudging etc, you need to but a base on your eyes. You could use cover up, vaseline, or a base eyeshadow.|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	you might be oily.  try washing your face and putting powder on before applying eyeliner.  if you wear foundation don't put it near your eye line where you would apply eyeliner.|`|41UtJiaMaa	get a thin brush and a similar color eyeshadow and trace over it with eyeshadow. another thing is to wear a skin colored eyeshadow with it, or anything to make your skin powdery because the oils in the skin moisten it, and when you eyes are open, the eyeliner then absorbs the oils.|`|AA12075899	Are you wearing a primer/base? DO you have oily eyelids? What kind of liner are you using? How long are you wearing it before it smudges? There are many factors that can cause your eyeliner to smear. Oily eyelids are a big cause...wearing a primer/base helps. Try using a waterproof liner. A cheap recommendation is Maybellines Unstoppable. There are also gel liners that are smudge proof, some drug store brands are HIP or Jane.|`|YLezctqpaa	Make sure it's waterproof?  I've had an eyeliner before, And  Every time I put it on it wil too  smear, But I bought waterproof, And that  stays on :)|`|Yue2YKTnaa	primer first and then waterproof eyeliner
hTr1dpTiaa	Not at all, I was so disappointed. It takes off about 30% of the hair I'd say, after "scrubbing" for a good long time. Not worth it.
tx8iEBgAaa	lets face it....      WAX.!    I know it sounds daunting... i've asked questions on here before I waxed mine, I thought about pain etc... I asked about products etc... and finally i thought well to hell with it, i am going to do it myself!!! I got sally hensons no-heat kit and waxed it myself and you know what... no dark under growth!!!! not pain!!! in the kit it had a prewash and numbing type lotion and after lotion, worked a treat. I'll never have to worry about that dark hair again...    hope this helps... if you don't want to wax use the hair cream, but I've never used it so I really don't know much about it.....!!!|`|s67BloUxaa	paint your *****|`|6a60fc76b51aaef7e6e9051ad2ad4d85aa	you could wax, shave or use hair removal cream  its always better to use sensitive skin types too
JV8HfDb4aa	left...unless ur homosexual...then u can get right.  but the general rule is to get the left one pierced if ur just getting one piercing.|`|kaoikQXwaa	I have my left pierced, but that's just what looked better on me.

But it also depends on the person.
wjvRODjUaa	Yeah they should be pretty tight|`|j5mteNnjaa	yes, i play travel softball. Hmm I actually think they're pretty comfy. They protect you from hurting yourself when you slide|`|8p7ZmllVaa	yes because when you go to slide, they shouldnt slide up like regular shorts or underwear. they are meant to protect your leg a little better|`|4SyINs07aa	yes because they are supposed to protect you|`|BRVNx6ZPaa	Yea, but it matters would kind you get. Under Armour's sliding shorts are tight but not unconfertable|`|PxMNxytjaa	Yeah.|`|QKEYRzOiaa	Yes. Sliding shorts should be tight because the tighter they usually are, they more they will prevent you from getting cuts. You want sliding shorts that are pretty tight, but not cut off your circulation tight.

40476bbce9e2f1306244d82795226962aa	Try vitamin E its suppose to help it go away. Plastic surgeons have said it really helps.

Sorry.|`|x5R1zUtraa	How about water proof makeup? Or wear like swim shorts, they come in a variety of different colours.
Ux2dBxtDaa	Well, chemical treatments can be from 200 dollars, to 1,000 dollars. Chemical straightening doesn't always work; and your hair might remain frizzy.    You should probably save up the money, and buy a good shampoo and conditioner such as Biolage, a good hair masque, a CHI flat iron, and research Silk Drops, you'll find it all over the internet.    If you decide to do this, it will most likely last about 5-7 months, 8 if you're lucky. If you do this, get your hair cut too.     Get it with lots of layers, with a LOT of volume at the top and thinner towards the tip. You'll want to get GOT2B hairspray, because it has a really strong hold. You'll want to use a wax, and you can find great ones on the internet. I won't recommend one because there's way too many to choose from.    Tease it at the top and leave it kind of obvious that you teased it. Buy a teasing comb, you can find it at any beauty supply store. Tease it mainly at the roots, and blow dry it promptly, and hairspray it lightly down. After doing this all over the top, spray all over for that extra hold.     Good luck, and if you decide to do it, BEWARE. It damages your hair! But like I said, good luck and be sure to go to a professional, prominent salon.|`|hdEvZLoXaa	i wouldn't chemically  straighten it i  would  straighten it with a straightening iron|`|rHhtn7plaa	depends on length and were you go you will have to ask who is doing your hair from 40 to 100 depending on the hairstylist where your getting it done you can do it your self but if you don't no what your doing i wouldn't advise it. have you tried a flat iron ?|`|AA11664585	if your hair is not extremely curly, it will do a lot of damage. It is a permanent process, so just like color it will stay until it is cut off, you will get roots just like with color and you will have to have it touched up, and if you like it really straight, you will still have to straighten it with an iron. and the price can range from 60(if your lucky) all the way up to 200 depending on the length, and amount of hair. Just make sure you stylist does the right tests to determine the porosity and elasticity of your hair!|`|lyrS9wSuaa	it really depends on what they are going to use on you. don't get a relaxer that won't make it any better. just more work for you. so what are they going to use on your hair??
nbWO3IANaa	1] a dress with sleeves will probably have enough back to cover you up.  2] look at ALL formal dresses - bridesmaid, special occasion, not just prom dresses [ check out online sales/clearance! ]  3] consider dermabrasion if scars are very bad - you don't want to worry about this forever.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	How about a dress that is normal but then just get a little fitted bolero or something to wear over the top.     http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tVn-Je9IJ1w/SK...    http://fashionoa.files.wordpress.com/200...

k0j3phebaa	the one's at american eagle and pac sun are good. ohh and also roxy.   :)|`|4RMInr2raa	american eagle is wear i buy mine, there not to much and they always fit me great. im a size 8!!!!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Everyone DOES NOT look good in skinny jeans like that person said. There is only a small percentage of people who actually do look good int hem. And that's fine. Just dress for your shape. There's no point spending money on something that 'fits' if you put it on and feel awkward and silly every time you wear it. I recommend going to the store and trying on a whole heap of jeans. Jeans are something that one style can look great on one person and horrible on the next, it doesn't matter what size you are, a lot of people have that issue. So just try a heap one, all different styles and see which ones look best on you.  If skinnys don't work for you but you still like the style, you could try a looser straight leg cut.|`|pYpXj7gOaa	everyone looks good in skinny jeans. pretty much any person can pull it off with a cute pair of flats or converse :)|`|aMTpg1Njaa	The best places to buy skinny jeans are at Forever 21 && Pac Sun. they come in different styles and sizes(:  just go to : www.forever21.com OR www.pacsun.com|`|KMy4b77naa	vertical stripes and pinstriping do wonders. it's really the only way to go.|`|OVlxNuLfaa	so who cares my thighs look big in skinny jeans...that's why I don't wear them...I don't even like the whole skinny jean idea...I think girls look much prettier and girly in straight leg or flare jeans...don't just do things cauz ur classmates do it...be urslf and wear what looks good on u and what u like ;)|`|9JzsDSB1aa	Check Marshalls  they have and have different types and wet seal also|`|CyIxcsz0aa	Skinny jeans, like many fashion trends, are pretty sexy (or atleast at the moment :-P)   But the truth of the matter is some people can't pull of some fads. It's not about being ugly, unfit, or fat- its about the curves God gave us to carry babies someday.  My suggestion? Try on a few pairs at different stores, if the style doesn't work, don't kill it.   But to cure shortness issues: stilletto's look AMAZING with skinny jeans, and the thigh issue? Wear a longer top. Long tops make your torso longer and slimmer, and when long ENOUGH hide the thighs, to keep your legs from shrinking, wear heels.    But remember, every trend isn't made for every figure. Find what looks good on you, look at the models in magazines with similar figures for ideas. It's much better then cloning classmates anyway !!!    Good luckkkk!|`|GlBcmZzHaa	try american eagle.|`|cqEYllm9aa	you should wear darker jeans with no bleaching or big patterns to look more sliming. try sirens, or H&M|`|sbJShu9vaa	Isis- Anchor Blue  I'm a size 0-3
