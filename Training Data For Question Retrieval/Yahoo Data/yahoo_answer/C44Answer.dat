TROOPS ENTERED LOS ANGELES TO RESTORE ORDER; TOMORROW THEY WILL BE GRATEFULl! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.

Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘INTERNATIONALISTS’ and of conspiring with others around the world to BUILD A MORE INTEGRATED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE - one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I STAND GUILTY AND I AM PROUD OF IT.<br>  ~David Rockefeller, from his autobiography “Memoirs”<br>  <br>  "We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their PROMISES OF DISCRETION for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to DEVELOP OUR PLAN FOR THE WORLD if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years. But the world is now more sophisticated and PREPARED TO MARCH TOWARDS A WORLD GOVERNMENT which will never again know war, but only peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in the past centuries."<br>  ~David Rockefeller in an address to the Bilderberger group in Baden-Baden, Germany, June 10, 1991.<br>  <br>  <br>  We are in for some VERY tough times ahead, I hope people understand this...

You have to serve this document on the other party (think of the scenes in movies where a process server suprises someone and sez "you've been served!").  The defendant then has to submit an "answer", detailing his defenses against your complaint.  You then go through "discovery" which is when you demand evidence from the other side (usually documents, or sometimes interviews).  Then you go to trial and show your evidence to the jury, who decides.<br>  <br>  It's a pretty complex process, and the above paragraph just scratches the surface.  Go to the library and get a self help book.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	If it is for a small amount of money, go to the local small claims court.  They have forms for you to fill out.

The Fraser Institute, a Vancouver think tank, has calculated that in 2003, the average waiting time from referral by a general practitioner to actual treatment was more than four months. Waiting times vary among specialties (and, less wildly, among provinces), but remain high even for critical diseases: The shortest median wait is 6.1 weeks for oncology treatment; excluding radiation, which is longer. Extreme cases include more than a year’s median wait for neurosurgery in New Brunswick. The median wait for an MRI is three months. Since 1993, waiting times have increased by 90%.<br>  <br>  Waiting lines impose a real cost, which is approximated by what individuals would be willing to pay to avoid them. Waiting costs include health risk, lost time (especially for individuals whose time is most valuable), pain and anguish. Socialist systems are notoriously oblivious to anguish, discomfort, humiliation and other subjective factors which bureaucrats cannot measure or don’t value the same way as the patient does.<br>  <br>  A Québec physician, Dr. Jacques Chaoulli, is suing the government for not allowing patients to pay for better care.

Yes, we are dealing with several chronic illnesses in our family.  So far it has worked out very well.  We know how lucky we are.  We have too many friends and family members who have inferior health insurance or no insurance at all due to an inability to pay for it.  Counting our lucky stars...|`|4d4ad126cb9f6297171d0aa263e7d425aa	Excellent question.<br>  Until both my wife and I lost our jobs earlier this year, we had excellent health insurance paid by our employer. Since then, we have had to buy our own coverage. My wife has a chronic condition. Because of this, we had to buy a lower coverage policy, which still cost us over $800 a month.<br>  Only one of us, me, has found another job. Of course that job has me underemployed making a little over 1/2 the salary I used to make. This job comes with no medical benefits. As you can imagine, the $800 a month payment is a tough nut to crack.<br>  The likelihood of my wife getting a job that would cover the cost of childcare is bleak.|`|kJM65nXJaa	I have health insurance through my husband. It is mediocre at best. They just raised the co pay to $25, RX's went up also. When I went for my yearly mammogram this year, it was not covered.The insurance co. said there must be a reason, in order for them to cover. I guess early detection is not a valid reason. I am lucky that the office people know how to phrase things, because god forbid I end up some kind of preexisting condition.  I'd say lol, but there is nothing funny about any of this.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I have excellent health care coverage. I pay a percentage with my employer paying the rest.

REiQzRB3aa	I like Glocks but I really don't care for full sized pistols, I prefer compacts personally. When it comes to concealing a firearm (especially for a woman) size matters...haha. A gun that is too big can be both more difficult to shoot as well as more difficult to conceal. The Glock 17 is the most widely used pistol in law enforcement worldwide and for that price, you could probably find something better. I personally love my S&W M&P .40 compact. So considering that you might not want something any bigger than a 9mm since you are having troubles with double feeds and limp wrist you should try to fix your shooting troubles and stick with the 9mm. Try locating and shooting a Glock 19 compact (it's basically a reduced size version of the Glock 17) and it [should] cost about $450-$500 or S&W M&P 9mm compact which runs about $600-$650.<br>  <br>  To fix limp wrist, first make sure to hold the pistol properly:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.defensereview.com/stories/shotshow2008/GlockWorx_DocterOptic_3_SHOT_Show_2008_2-04-08.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.defensereview.com/stories/sho...</a><br>  <br>  Second, do NOT try to grip the pistol tighter in your hands to fix limp wrist, this will only make matters and your aim worse. Instead, try to lock your wrists and lightly push them together without pushing so hard as to ruin your aim. Let both of your wrists and forearms work together as one to absorb the recoil, kind of like using your knees to absorb a jump when skiing (sorry, the only comparison I could think of).|`|8ivnzNi5aa	To get over the limp wrist, just keep practicing as much as you can.  Considering that Glocks didn't even exist 30 years ago and are now a de facto standard law-enforcement sidearm in the USA, they must be doing something right.  I sure don't like that price, but I'm just a tightwad.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	"Limp wristing" can be a problem with any semi-auto pistol.  Essentially you're not keeping the frame steady enough for the slide to be able to travel far enough to eject the previous casing.  When you grip, you should be applying about a firm-handshake's pressure to the front and rear straps only, with no pressure on the sides of the grip.  Placing the fingers of your support hand over the fingers of your shooting hand allows you to steady the grip even more.   When fired, the pistol will tip up at the muzzle and down at the rear of the beavertail and slide.  This will push the front strap outward, away from you.   By keeping the web of your hand firmly against the beavertail (no space) and keeping a firm, but steady back-pressure against the front strap, you should be able to do away with limp-wristing.<br>  <br>  As far as ejection and extraction failures go, every pistol can have them, but Glocks are known to be able to function well, despite being severely dirty.  I would suspect there is something more wrong here.  It's possible that there's an issue with the extractor being clogged, so that it can't properly snap closed on the rim of the casing, but it isn't generally a problem with Glocks.  Take a look at the little hook, mounted at the ejection port.  Look to see if it is, in fact, a hook, or if it's been clogged or damaged.<br>  <br>  That said, you can buy brand new Glocks for less than the one they want to sell you.  While I personally love Glocks, and would fully support the purchase of any model, I would recommend that you don't buy that particular pistol.  Buy a new Glock, from a reputable dealer, and you will enjoy a thorough knowledge of how your Glock has been treated.|`|GajMYWR9aa	I like the Glock 17 for several reasons: It has a high capacity (17 rounds), it is lightweight, and it has a 'Safe Action' trigger system. If you are, personally, having problems with the weapon, I would suggest finding one that you would like better and could use more efficiently. However, I think it is a good weapon. Hope that helps!|`|fMS1kDA2aa	ehh decent. i just don't like the style of it. im a Beretta guy|`|e1vVM7p9aa	It sounds like the Glock you are buying is in horrible condition. I have a 22 and that I have had for years that has never jammed (except from some really old dud rounds). <br>  Most law enforcement agencies are moving away from 9mm towards a higher powered caliber so you can find a lot of used 9mm if you shop around. And remember that the guy is trying to sell you and gun for profit so don't always take his word on it being "just dirty" or "limp wristed." That is just BS to sell you a crappy gun.|`|z5spzNYaaa	if you do get one do not use oil on anything besides the barrel, and only teflon type or remington teflon sliders, <br>  you prolly want to take it to a smith first off, degrease it, shave some of the strain off of trigger pull and use graphite dry lube on everything, do not touch insides of weapon with hands unless you plan on cleaning rigorously, or unless you have the graphite on it.<br>  probably could shave some metal off of the slide and create a slight funnel on the barrel and the parts of the slide that have come in contact with bullets, remember graphite, or somthing else that dries and subtracts friction as the grease and oils atract dust.<br>  <br>  for limpwristedness you can swing a machette or pipe at weads, that will help build your forearm strength while taking out pesky plants.. or you could have a grip made or put on your gun.

Car workers regularly strike for more money, when Peugeot closed these people were complaining that they wouldn't be able to get another job paying them upwards of ￡20 per hour.  It is the same across all industries. <br>  <br>  Unskilled production line staff getting that sort of money is more disgusting than foreign workers coming to England and working for less wages.  <br>  <br>  We are taxed more than the rest of Europe, our politicians and bankers are all entrenched in corruption. The cost of living in this country is astronomical.  If people take to the streets I think it will be for far more reasons than a few foreigners, the majority of which work for a living.

She is hypocrisy to the extreme- she is a moral opportunist and belongs to the Rove/Cheney school of power mongering.

She makes Bush look like an off the charts, articulate genius. <br>  <br>  McCain's move was desperate. He could have made good sense focusing on Obama's lack of experience. Instead he undermined himself by picking Palin- who had little experience or knowledge about anything beyond her state. This was a concession to the Far Right- especially given his tedious relationship with them during hard fought primaries. It was also the old Rovian school of election strategy- solidify the base. <br>  <br>  Palin became even more of a sound-byte than Obama.

Again, this is a measure that some of his supporters hail as a grand step forward, while his detractors point out that it could provide an additional severe drag on the economy, especially in car manufacturing areas. <br>  <br>  Signed an executive order that restored a 30-day timeframe for former presidents to review records before they are released. It also eliminated the right for the vice president or family members of former presidents to do the reviews. <br>  <br>  Signed an executive order that requires that appointees sign forms saying that they were not hired because of political affiliations or contributions.

EuGsGfuJaa	From a legal standpoint, technically you did not press charges.  You filed a complaint, and the state felt there was sufficient evidence to pursue charges.  Now with that out of the way, you CAN invoke spousal privilege and thereby refuse to testify.  You need to inform the State's Attorney and ideally you want to tell the defense too.   Or if all else fails and the court date arrives, you can actually take the witness stand and say right there to the judge that you invoke spousal privilege (I saw this in-person when I studied for a law class).  You may have to do the latter anyway for legal reasons so that it's officially on record.  The judge will then make sure you mean it and warn you about the court rules in Maryland, one of which I'll explain below.<br>  <br>  There are two wrinkles to this in the State of Maryland.  One is that in MD, you can only do this ONCE, and the court keeps a record.  If this happens again, you cannot invoke spousal privilege again for assault.  You will be compelled to testify under penalty of contempt (which could spell jail for YOU).  The reason for this is of course the battered spouse effect, wherein a person in an abusive relationship, despite being victimized, will keep trying to save their abuser and stay with them.  There are whole books on that topic though.<br>  <br>  The second wrinkle is if there is evidence of the assault besides your word against his (for example photos of injuries or other witnesses besides you, especially if the witness is a cop).  If they don't need your testimony, they can try him without you for the assault.<br>  <br>  Now on a personal note, nobody should hit anybody in a marriage.  You shouldn't hit him and he shouldn't hit you.  If he didn't actually hit you or both of you hit each other and only he got arrested, it is better to try and get the charges dismissed so that justice will be done.  But you two should pursue marital counseling regardless.  He sounds like he'd be up for it if he's taking anger management.<br>  <br>  But if he really did hit you and you didn't physically provoke him, I think you need to testify.  Consequences need to be brought on someone who does that, or they will never learn.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Hmm, in some ways a choke is worse that hitting.  I studied martial arts, and a choke can kill in under 15 seconds.  Using force on your part to stop a choke is NOT assault.  It is self-defense.  That's why you were not charged.  You did nothing wrong.  There are so many variables though.  If I were you, I'd testify against him.  You could ask for leniency I suppose.  But he's gotta learn, even if it's the hard way.  Now, Assault 2nd Degree is the least serious of assault charges, so jail may not be in the cards unless he has priors.  Impossible to say for sure though, because obviously I don't know the details.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	As the party who signed the criminal complaint, you can refuse to testify.  More important than the legal question,  is the need for you realize that you will be back into a marriage in which you will likely be subject to  physical abuse.  You say "my husband and I got into a fight one night....."  Still, your husband is the one going to anger management classes.  If this what you want, you should call the prosecutor's office and tell them now that you will not testify.   The court system will not protect you as well as you can protect yourself.|`|IWWZdZRpaa	You can tell the District Attorney that you are invoking your marital privilege and that you will not testify against him.  If they have enough evidence from outside sources they may go forward with the charges anyway.  Oh BTW, leave him.

Someone else will come along and start building something else using their factories.  There is no such thing as too big to fail.  The government has no right to intervene and corporations should take responsibility for their actions.  <br>  The banks made bad loans.  That sucks for them.

Will we continue to have a hybrid economy, with socialist programs like Social Security, Medicare, and public education? Yes. And we might even more towards universal health insurance, a design that is accepted even among conservatives in many European countries. Will we continue to have private sector socialism, such as mandatory auto insurance and mortgage insurance? Yes, we will. But, to think this country will become like Cuba shows either extreme paranoia or a deep and profound ignorance of the history of our country.

That can be done in a number of ways:<br>  <br>  Increase taxes on the rich.   They have the money, and the rates are artificially low (the reason for the Bush deficits).    <br>  <br>  Cut the cap on FICA taxes.   Let all income apply, and Social Security will be well funded for our grandkid's kids.<br>  <br>  Create revenue from the market.   We can use it as a form of regulation.   For example - tax all stock/securities sold less than 2 years after it's purchased.   Speculators & day traders would pay a tax for buying/selling fast.    This would create a tremendous amount of money, and also force people to INVEST rather then SPECULATE or pump and dump stocks.   This would also allow corporate CEO's to take a longer term approach when making decisions and not be held to every profit statement....because it would be harder for investors to just dump a stock...they'd be more likely to stick to it for long term motives.<br>  <br>  Cut spending.

iuoB7pf0aa	The government and the FDA are in it together. The government is the one that pushed to get it in all of our foods. The reason is because they need something at all times poisoning us. High Fructose Corn Syrup is a poison that slowly kills you. And you wonder why they put so many things like that in our food.... other things like splenda, anything with aspartame, sacchrine, or sucralose are bad and poisonous for you too. And the reason they do that is because the government wants the whole human population to be half a billion, on top of that the more older people that die (from stuff like heart attacks and strokes which is what high fructose corn syrup eventually causes) the less the government has to pay for social security and all of the other things they're supposed to be helping the elderly american people with. <br>  <br>  So,  the FDA and the government are both bad, both evil, both corrupt and the reason they are allowed to put all of that poison in our foods is because it's what the govt wants. The FDA is supposed to keep us safe, make sure our foods are harmless but what they're actually doing is using their name as a mask to say "we're making sure your food is healthy" but what they're really doing is poisoning us. The FDA knows full well what they are doing, they also know that aspartame, sucralose and saccharine have been proven to cause serious diseases and health issues.. Like symptoms of Muscular Sclerosis, but many times once a person stops drinking all of those diet sodas that they're addicted to their MS symtpoms go away. <br>  <br>  They've found in autopsies that people who regularly drank diet sodas have pockets of the fake sweeteners in their brains. The sweetener (poison) goes to the stomach, the stomach doesn't recognise it and doesn't know what to do with it so it sends the sweetener to the liver, the liver doesn't know what to do with it so it gets sent to the brain. At that time the sweeteners just sit there and gell, kind of coagulate. So.... anything like that stuff is bad. Just a few things I've learned over the years after digging stuff up on the government, going to pharmacy school, and reading more and more on those fake sweeteners. Of course, they'll tell you the fake sweeteners are harmless, they are not harmless.

The following is a case which is an example of what I see everyday:<br>  <br>  In Sept. I had a coulple come in to apply for themselves and their 1 child. They had both been working at the same factory for the last 7 years. The factory closed, they lost their insurance. They had not been living beyond their means-they had a house valued at $90,000, one fairly new car, and had about $3,000 in savings. The wife was an insulin dependant diabetic who also suffered from asthma. Her monthly medications totaled $800. They both received unemployment-wife $187 weekly and husband $225 weekly. That was too much for them to receive Medicaid benefits for themselves, only their child received benefits. Because they were ashamed of being on unemployment, they both started working at Wal-mart, but Wal-mart only hired part time and because they were making so little and still paying their mortgage and other responsibilities, they could not afford the insurance. They are still making 'too much' for Medicaid benefits. <br>  <br>  I'm sure some on here will say they could look for a better job. Well you can search 'Craigslist' all you want, but in our area 65 percent of the employers have laid off in the last year. They are not hiring. The places who are hiring do not pay enough for people to get by even if they don't own a home. If my husband did not make the salary he does, I could not afford to work as a Medicaid caseworker-I do not even make enough to support myself. I certainly don't think a family who just takes 'any' job as many recommend and make even less than I do could possibly support themselves without help.<br>  <br>  Before anyone states that there are organizations that help the poor with medical needs-our 'free clinic' has a 8 month wait to be seen for ongoing conditions.<br>  <br>  Our state is due to run out of funds to pay unemployment benefits in March.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	What is the alternative?<br>  <br>  I agree, luck plays a part in what happens to us.

By cutting taxes on businesses, those businesses would then be able to hire more employees, expand their businesses and within 6-12 months, the economic "crisis" would largely work itself out.  Instead, the idiots in D.C. are increasing government spending (money the government doesn't have) on projects that will create jobs only in those areas they deem worthy (like green energy). <br>  <br>   It will take years for the effects of this spending to be felt in the economy (the money has to be allocated, distributed, it has to go through procurement and contract processes).  By the time the money gets into the economy, it's impact will be negligible.  <br>  <br>  THE DEMOCRATS ARE CURRENTLY DESTROYING OUR NATION.

I worked at a police station once, and the reason for this is the new 'friendly' approach.<br>  <br>  Thing I don't understand is how are they going to identify which gang is causing trouble. By the time police arrive they have dispersed, and police patrols, both in cars and on foot, have significantly dropped. Are there to be even more cctv's put up... and if so isn't going to increase the 'big brother' society we already live in.<br>  <br>  I also agree with the answerer who suggests funding difficulties. A great idea, but is it empty rhetoric, designed to appease middle classes who traditionally support the tories?<br>  <br>  I know a lot of youngsters who wear hoodies, most of them law abiding.

1KGXts5Daa	Well, you *may* have a "legal case here".<br>  <br>  I understand that you have had eczema all your life, and that you began using a topical steroidal creme in 1993.  You do not give a date as to when you stopped using it, but I'm guessing you used it for quite a few years.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, prescription-strength steroidal cremes are recommended for limited-duration usage - a fact which I'm sure your doctor is aware of.  She is also most likely aware of the types of situations where such treatment may be prolonged.<br>  <br>  "Permanent" reddening of the face is known as Rosacea, which can be brought on by long-term use of corticosteroid cremes.  <br>  <br>  Fortunately, it is treatable with medication which I'm sure your doctor (or any reputable dermatologist) is aware of and can prescribe.<br>  <br>  That being so, the condition does not have to be permanent for you.<br>  <br>  The condition is known as "steroid-induced rosacea".  It occurs in some people after applying corticosteroid ointments to their face for a long period to treat eczema or other rashes. The onset of this condition is sudden. <br>  <br>  The same telltale redness, pimples, and thin, wavy red lines appear on the face as in standard rosacea, but people with steroid-induced rosacea usually have these symptoms wherever the steroid ointment was applied -  not just centrally located on the face like is typical of people with standard rosacea.<br>  <br>  People with steroid-induced rosacea also often have a distinctive shine to their facial skin.<br>  <br>  Steroid-induced rosacea is treated by first stopping the steroid creme application (which it sounds like you have), and then by taking the same medications as with standard rosacea.  Your doctor or a dermatologist can prescribe them.<br>  <br>  Although it can take several months of treatment before symptoms subside, steroid-induced rosacea is not likely to recur. <br>  <br>  I would advise that you go that route first before considering any legal action.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Who said it was supposed to be used only for a short time frame?|`|nbibIzC5aa	You should speak to an attorney on this matter.

The attorney will also advise you if there are any special procedures needed to be perform before a case can go ahead.  It may vary from state to state, but you may be required to have a medical board review the case in order to determine if any malpractice was involved.  Lastly, when you speak to an attorney, make sure that you give all the information possible in order to assist them.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|KsMLHzbzaa	NO, BECAUSE THEIR IS NO PROOF.

Have you seen another doctor to find out if , in fact the damage is truly forever?<br>  <br>  I was told that overuse of steroid cream can cause damage, but that it would clear up after being discontinued. (but this was from extremely little use, I don't know how long or how much you were using.<br>  <br>  Doctors always seem to over prescribe medications I am given, and am left with throwing out most of it. It is their responsibility not to give too much of a medication, but they should be checking you regularly to monitor it.  Did you go in for at least (yearly) rechecks? Did the doctor continue to tell you to keep using it every time you went in, or did you just get it once and never go back again for re checks?

So that leaves the subjects to be the bills authors, simplified, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and friends. <br>  <br>  But the cartoon itself/<br>  The allegory of chimps writing comes from the saying. "A million chimps on a million typewriters will eventually produce Shakespeare" the learning point of the saying is that, just because a random source produces an output which is reasonable or understandable, that in fact the result is merely a coincidence, that does not diminish the randomness and unreliability of the source. The way that it was used in the cartoon was to suggest the writers of the bill, (the dems in congress as the Repubs were shut out), were themselves a random source, and that any resemblance to actual stimulus is purely coincidental.

The notion that Hoover did nothing is an absolute myth dreamed up by those who chose to discredit his intervenionist policies in favor of Roosevelt's socialistic interventionist policies.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	No.  The Economy isn't even near the Depression Era range.  That's just a scare tactic to get his spending implemented. <br>  <br>  Additionally Hoover's response to the Recession was nothing like Bush's.  He did not inact isolationist policies or tax the rich higher.|`|V6aH1vpQaa	Obama = FDR.  Bush=WPE (worst president ever)

gq93af81aa	When you entered you were most likely given a six month period to be in the country.  You can extend that with USCIS for up to another six months.  After that you have to leave the US.  There is no exact period of how long you need to be gone.  But if you try the "quicky" return you will appear to be using your visitor visa in such a way to live here.  You may get away with it once (you may not) but we intercept these people all of the time and refuse them entry to the US.  It's actually a pretty easy pick up.  This is contrary to the law and the intent of the visa, so no you are not allowed to do it.<br>  <br>  You aren't the first person who has thought of this, and you aren't going to be the last.  But I'll just say we're not flying blind when you enter, and it really doesn't work.  If you want to live here just get the right visa.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	If you have B2 Visa and it is about to expire, you must leave the U.S. for 48 hours then re-enter for another six months.

Secondly the person is assuming that the officer at immigration will give the alien six months stay, the person may only give them 14 days, 30 days or they may not admit them into the country at all; that is at the discretion of the guard at the time of entry.<br>  <br>  To actually answer your question: the only people who have a right to enter the U.S. "quickly" and "without problem" are U.S. citizens, which you are not and are therefore subject to the discretion of the guard at your port of entry.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	I know of people who did it to spend the day in Canada or Mexico or they left for a cruise and came back 5 days later without any problems - as long as you have a multiple entry visa that is valid.|`|IeJgYvZ7aa	Dont circumvent immigration enforcement as you cant be deported.

Within doubt we are always at war. Just don′t believe what the press says!|`|47d9854e65fb0cad294bec0cbb5ca642aa	Mission: meaning a place where troops are deployed in support of a military action. Not a permanent duty station unless its somewhere like Germany where you can actually be there for numerous years.  Places like Kuwait, Korea, Iraq, etc are usually 12 mos or less for any unit or individual, depending on the 'mission'.  Except in cases where they military deems it necessary to stay longer.
OiAl6w48aa	From a legal standpoint, you can't get in trouble for telling the truth.  So long as you didn't add a personal opinion (ie, "she's a dirty whore") you won't have to worry about legal repercussions.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you're in a right to work state, the boss will be well within his rights to fire you for any reason whatsoever or no reason at all.  However, given that he's already told a bunch of people about his daughter's acitivities, I have a hard time believing that he'd fire you for identifying her by her "porn name".|`|8vfCRg7Caa	this is why i try not to get too personal with people at work. I avoid conversations like this. Just because people are so immature about things. Why is it anybody business what anybody does? And its kind of ironic they are going around gossiping and looking at porn anyway. But no, i doubt they would do anything to you. Slander would be something like you stopped a person from getting a job. For instance, if you worked some where and job called about an ex coworker who used to work there and you said "hes always late, smells bad and never washes his clothes". True not you can be sued for slander. <br>  <br>  But here you didnt really start anything. Somebody told you some information and he told other people as well. That wont hold up in court. Unless you some how were telling this to people who were under age of 18. And that would be a whole different charge all together.<br>  <br>  Not only that, the guy is stupid. i would never spread anything negative about my daughter. The fact that she worked in playboy, i dont see why anybody at work would need to know that? If it was me i would have denied it.|`|nbibIzC5aa	"Slander is the oral communication of false statements that are harmful to a person's reputation. If the statements are proven to be true, it is a complete defense to a charge of slander." (USLegal.com, definitions)<br>  <br>  Whether or not a company may fire you for your statements, you should check with your company's policies to see if they have any ground to do so.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

tXZTi73kaa	Boot Camp is both physically and mentally draining, but if you are mentally tough and disciplined, someone like you should breeze through it.  If you've ever seen the movies, particularly Full Metal Jacket, you should know that the Marines believe heavily in group punishment... meaning that your entire platoon is going to be punished for the mistakes of the few stragglers.  If you become a squad leader, (sounds like you will), you will pay the price when someone in your squad messes up.<br>  My personal favorite part of boot was fighting with pugil sticks.  It's awesome!!  <br>  As for Parris Island, it's a mosquito and sand-flea infested swamp that consists only of a military base.<br>  But for now, enjoy your life while you're young.  You're only 13, and a recruiter won't even speak to you until you're at least 17 and a senior in high school.  But I am glad you are so interested in the Marines and I highly recommend it as I am very proud of my service and it helped me land a great job in the civilian world.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	You want to know some games they play?

The next 5 years of your life will change your views however. While in highschool i suggest doing sports, football wrestling and a spring sport(spring football if you can) these will condition you physically and if you have the right coaches mentally as well.
vZ4NXlBmaa	yes.<br>  <br>  I've seen a "mental person" give very helpful/accurate details on a traffic accident he witnessed<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a feeling you're leaving out details though|`|ugWaptu2aa	Yes, but the police would still have to advise them of their rights of self incrimination and offer to speak with an attorney before being questioned. Although if I ever came across a police report that used a mentally ill person I would file a motion to dismiss them as a witness. Or at the very least question the officers if they used a mental health professional who could asses if the witness (or suspect) was mentally fit to stand trial.|`|e1vVM7p9aa	Depends on what you mean.

Where was it to come from, the South?  That would be taking property from one person and not giving them just compensation for it.  That's against the Constitution.
3ixmHSwmaa	I get it. You're a stary-eyed dreamer, like your name suggests. Protectionist policies have never benefited this country, ever. Why do you think all of a sudden it will now? I agree that support from other nations is desired, but we fight the fights that we deem need fighting. Pelosi and her liberal bunch had two years to stop the war in Iraq by cutting off funding, and they didn't. That should tell you something about support for the war.<br>  <br>  By the way, WWII was not our biggest war. The Civil War was far bigger per capita than any other. Interestingly, the South put up a great fight with virtually no manufacturing base.<br>  <br>  Florida Husker:<br>  You are absolutely correct.

HtHFHfDKaa	Murder is something that is done in cold blood that is not thought out.<br>  Manslaughter is still done in cold blood but with planning.<br>  <br>   There’s a quick trick for telling the difference between murder and manslaughter. If your “friend” planned the crime ahead of time, it’s murder. You see, most of the world’s legal systems distinguish between cold-blooded killings, crimes of passion, and accidental (but still unlawful) deaths. In America, “murder” applies to carefully preplanned deaths, such as a mafia hit. “Voluntary manslaughter” on the other hand is what’s committed when, for example, a husband catches his wife in bed with a tennis pro and snaps. A third category, “involuntary manslaughter,” covers situations in which the death is neither preplanned nor intentional—for instance, convincing your buddy that riding his bike off a cliff would be a totally rad idea. Of course, criminal law still differs widely from nation to nation. In Japan, the worst sentences are reserved for people who kill their own descendants, while in Italy, a punishment can actually be lessened if the killer can prove that he acted to avenge his honor.|`|O8rqfq3Daa	Murder is killing someone with the intent to kill whereas manslaughter is an accidental killing.  there are two types of manslaughter, involuntary and voluntary.  Involuntary manslaughter is where death is neither preplanned or intentional and voluntary manslaughter is like when you kill a guy who is sleeping with your wife.  1st degree murder is premeditated or pre-planned.  2nd degree murder is unplanned but the murder was intended.  2rd degree murder is unplanned and unintended.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	1st degree is pre-meditated, planned murder. Like if you set up a plan to kill a certain person at a certain time.<br>  <br>  . 2nd degree is when when you are helping someone kill another, but not directly involved<br>  <br>  3rd degree is when you ment to harm someone but not kill them.. like a fight or something...<br>  <br>  Manslaughter is when you kill someone by doing something reckless like drunk driving ect.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Manslaughter is basically a death by negligence or accident.  No planning involved, just stupidity.<br>  <br>  Murder has some level of premeditation, and that can only be for an instant.  The different levels are the amount of planning, forethought, and execution of the crime.|`|PfRctum7aa	These links will help you.|`|9VRwBeATaa	Murder 1st degree - murder with intent, and premeditation<br>  <br>  Murder 2nd degree - intent to kill, but without premeditation<br>  <br>  Manslaughter is a less serious charge to homicide which refers to the accidental killing of another person.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	In Scotland, murder is where you intended to kill, or were wickedly reckless about the the person's life. <br>  <br>  Manslaughter, in the most basic form, is where you committed an assault, which caused death.

See where you end up.|`|hpzfccwaaa	They had to be chased down they did not want to pay their taxes in a timely manor which ended up offsetting the balance of time for the economy and pissed off the poor people.|`|qczTENowaa	I tried to cut and paste the Democrat rap sheet, but Yahoo said there wasn't enough memory to display it|`|Nqp4zjGSaa	Feb 2009.....Newly appointed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton embarasses the U.S. and insults millions of humanitarians......|`|2wyIOGi7aa	January 2001: on the day before leaving office, Clinton agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas law license as part of an agreement with the independent counsel to end the investigation.

That says it all. And who the hell are these people? Scott Eller? Brent Wilkes? These are no names scattered about the country - why not making a laundry list of Obama's cabinet members in Washington? It is much more interesting, and much more relevant.|`|AA10928202	Rant much? Want some government cheese with your liberal whine?|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Where is the list of Democratic wrong doing? Did you look into that, or are you just reporting facts for one side of an argument?|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Cool facts.  What is your question again?|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	What a nice little (?) lead in to a rant.<br>  To answer your supposed question:  I assume you are talking about all the tax evaders Obama has rewarded with high level positions?<br>  Buddy, if that was you or me, we would have been UNDER the jail, by now.<br>  As far as "living in glass houses".....wasn't it you Obama supporters who ragged on Joe the Plumber for owing....what?....thirteen hundred dollars in property (not federal income) taxes?<br>  Can you hear the glass breaking?
73A0T8ltaa	Hey Jo, <br>  <br>  Yeah, the left-tards try bullying and 'advocating' any cause, just to get their whiny voices heard, and their foot in the door. I don't give them the time of day. "Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile." "Give them enough rope, and they'll hang themselves." "Only dogs get mad." etc|`|6cm6MB66aa	It isn't that at all . The N is ironic but really try to understand where your mind set is . If a black has an N you highlight it as you are doing now . You cant look at it as just an N you see it as the word N . As far as the chimp come on that was to obvious and intended to spark a fire and did what it was meant to do . That is just part of media controlling you and that is what you are blind to .|`|2wyIOGi7aa	They normally look really far into things that are not relevant but want to put emphasis on things that are not relevant to arguments.

I didn't see anything wrong with the picture, I actually had to read the rest all of your question.....<br>  what's even more Ironic is a conservative was the one to post and point it out.... didn't see any liberals pointing out this kind of crap.... could it be the conservative are the ones that like to stir the crap then call the liberal racists.....|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I'm a lib and did not find this offensive.  I did find the chimp cartoon to be offensive.  Since the Post apologized for that cartoon, I take that to mean I was not exactly out of line in my thinking on that one.|`|yW418gIJaa	They never miss a chance to vomit liberal rhetoric, so I would say it's a conscious effort to be hyper sensitive.|`|AA11963685	I don't see anything racist about that poster.  I did find the cartoon offensive for several reasons, the least having to do with perceived racism.  I do know some liberals who are over the top in seeing almost everything as being racist, but that is not the norm.  No more the norm than conservatives who act as though racism doesn't exist anymore at all.  Those are two extreme groups that are both composed of idiots in my opinion.  Racism exists, that can't be ignored, and it's easy to identify blatant racism.  The rest of it ends up being over interpreted and stretched to the point of pain.
klXWzV3waa	Many courts will work with the person to resolve the issue. But she must come forward and not wait for them to come knocking.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	It will not matter why she doesn't show. When you write a check it a a contract. She owes for the check plus all court fees and fines, regardless of why she did not show.<br>  First offense or not, now there will be a warrant for her arrest, jail time and also, most likely, garnishment of pay.<br>  Tell her to 'step up' and do the right thing.<br>  When you write a check you have to have money in your account.|`|xFVDjZqPaa	what will most likely happen is she will go before the judge and have to explain herself, she is also gonna have to tell the judge how she plans on paying the money...like does she have a job, basically is she doing ANYTHING to show she is willing to make this work. Writing fraudulent checks is serious she should be really happy its only 304 and not more.|`|RTgMgT6baa	Borrow the money or write them a check would be the  best thing to do. If not probably Probation Then she will pay a lot more.|`|WwELeJMTaa	Jail. or if the judge is in a good mood it will be an extension with more fines.|`|EnMB5V7eaa	Get some better friends..<br>  <br>  <br>  Jail.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	DOG will hunt him down.|`|dTcJai7Aaa	i dunno maybe u could lend her some money nd then she pays it back to you, hey friends help each other|`|bXl12I4Baa	Righting check with out having the money is a fraud and it should do this. I do not believe is the first time. Perhaps the first time she got caught. She must get the money to pay back the check and the bank. But the fine she  may be Mack a dill with the court’s   I take one guy in the court  for 200.00 dollars ,and it cost him  650.00 dollars, and went in jell for 10 days ,and then a friend bell him out .but still he had to pay the fins.|`|M3maZgdyaa	That is up to the judge. If she is that broke maybe she would be better off serving the three or four days she will get for the fines. That way when her unemployment comes in she will have something to live on.|`|AA11966821	She has to pay.  Failure to pay can constitute proof of fraud.  <br>  <br>  She could well go to jail.  She needs an attorney, and she should have hired one before this.  An attorney might have been able to negotiate a payment plan or something.  Too late to negotiate a payment plan now.  The best an attorney might do is know some state program for first-time offenders that will get her community service or something instead of jail.  No lawyer, she probably goes to jail for fraud.<br>  <br>  If there were any restrictions on her moving to another county when she bonded out, and she moved without court permission, she has another felony, and will go to jail.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Yes, payment arrangement can be done. Just have him explain to the judge that he has not be able to find work. It will be good for him to have a list of the places with name and phone numbers in which he has applied for job.|`|AA11571284	It's either payment arrangements.......of jail.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	having been through the court system i realized, doesnt matter if you have an un paid parking ticket or you killed somebody. They are going to take it seriously as far as finding you and prosecuting you. Id say have her call the court and tell the prosecutor. Assuming they do have phones where shes at right? Sometimes you can stop things from "hitting the fan" if people would just call and tell somebody about it. But the next court date they set, she will have to make it. And she better have a good excuse. "im out of the country" will not due. <br>  <br>  As far total fees, every court has a pay system. They want their money so if you convince them you are going to pay, i doubt they want your friend in jail for 305 dollars on checks that were 51 dollars.<br>  <br>  Avoiding the court system is the easiest way to go to jail.

I guess there is a first time for everything eh !!|`|SFhITXHMaa	I don't smoke it now so probably not.  Does legality affect my behavior? Possibly, but if so I don't see how.  Legal and illegal are certainly not equatable with right and wrong.  Here are some further questions we should ask: <br>  <br>  How has marijuana been used as a scapegoat by law makers to further frighten an already paranoid society?<br>  <br>  Why were the Reaganites who financed the "Just say no" program allowed to give tax-payer money to major pharmaceutical companies for the production of narcotics like Ritalin and Prozac?<br>  <br>  What has the "War On Drugs" done other than provide a false justification for ethnic cleansing and imperialistic wars against democratic governments and peasant farmers?|`|9VRwBeATaa	Not unless I needed it for medical purposes.

Wt01utSbaa	I'm sorry, it wasn't just the content, but it was the manor in which he did it.<br>  <br>  At my childrens school, they wouldn't be able to wear a dirty t-shirt with scrawled writing all over it regardless of what it said.<br>  <br>  Its a stretch to say it is "Patriotism" to scrawl stereotypes about our president on a crappy fruit of the loom t-shirt. <br>  <br>  This kids parents should have more of a role in his life if they let him leave the house like that!|`|vSRhp7zxaa	The Supreme Court already ruled that schools have a right to prohibit students from making statements that are disruptive.  I don't agree with the ruling, but the conservative court decided it could limit free speech in that way.  <br>  <br>  This is just a reminder that the Supreme Court's anti-free speech position can harm conservatives as well.|`|lAuIxO1Jaa	haha, I saw a black guy yesterday wearing an I love Michelle t-shirt...of course it was Michelle Obama because it had his 'logo' on it.   I am thinking about making 'Save Gitmo' t-shirts...at least this is our humble way of saying what we want.  <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I am a Republican|`|2rcSILkWaa	It's not because it's patriot's day.  It's because it's disruptive to learning.  That's why there are dress codes to keep the disturbance down to a minimum.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	It is just as patriotic as Biden saying paying more taxes is our patriotic duty or Obama saying we are all going to have to do our duty and pay for the mistakes of others homes loans.<br>  <br>  Patriotic is in the eye of the beholder and if there are not exacting standards of Patriotic, the boy is correct.<br>  <br>  Remember all the Democrats who said it was not patriotic to support the US Troops in Iraq. They have a separate definition of patriotic than I do, just as this boy has---I stand a salute this young gentleman for doing what he feels is right.<br>  <br>  As for disruptive rule--what a joke in Govt Education--girls can show body parts and it is not disruptive, students can pierce exposed body parts and that is not disruptive but an Anti-Obama T is--no wonder our Govt Schools have failed.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	If you call that responsible, we could all live in a childish world.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	I bet if that was a Bush shirt they would have let him wear it.<br>  <br>  This is why I hate public schools.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Whatever makes you happy.|`|AA11765933	schools have dress codes for a good reason.  This kid was out of line and It brought undue attention for this kid to have that shirt on.  I would gladly wear an Anti McCain shirt any day!|`|DY9NOh4taa	Yes, it should there is nothing racist or about the shirt, which is the topic of the complaint no doubt.<br>  And so it begins, it is rather ironic, that the generation that is seeking to quash this student's right to express his political opinions, are from the very same generation, that fought and were often jailed for voicing their opinions, during the Vietnam War.<br>  Where those demonstrations, were not only against the war, but against the Presidency's of Johnson and Nixon, with the crown burning <br>  effigies of both presidents right outside the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.<br>  They are quick to forget their misdeeds and come after this student, when all he is doing is showing his political stance, and his feelings for the Presidency, which he is entitled to do under the First Amendment of the Constitution.<br>  Another part of it is race related, because of Obama being the first African American in the White House, there are nowhere near the amount of jokes on the Internet about Barack Obama as there are about all the past Presidents. I saw all kinds of jokes and t-shirts about former president Bush, and some of it would have made a sailor blush.<br>  You cannot escape the fact that any cartoons that are made that negatively reflects on Obama or makes fun of him is called racist, as was the cartoon that was in the NY Post last week, more attention was drawn to it by the complaints and more people looked at it than if nothing would have been said drawing even more attention to it.<br>  If they would have remained quiet and not said anything,|`|pVdV4gwgaa	They gave the kid the option to turn it inside out he didn't have  to take it off so he didn't have to be suspended. They didn't suspend him because it was an Obama shirt but because it was a disruption and he was defiant to turn it inside out. Here in California any shirt that is deemed disruptive they make you turn inside out. This ranges from having messages of depicting violence,sexism, alchohol, and hate violence. When given the option to turn the shirt around he was defiant to do so. If anything that was grounds to suspend him. I also want to point out that what is a 5th grader doing with a shirt like that anyway? 5 th graders don't care about politics they are watcing cartoons and playing outside. If this reflects badly on anyone it should be the parent's since they are the ones pushing their politicalbeliefs on their 5ht grader. I have seen many refer to Obama as a terrorist and this 5th grader doing so is disgusting and stereotypical. Oh yeah and Hannity is such a D-bag.|`|AQep0wRvaa	Since the election, I have seen many black students wearing Obama t-shirts to schools and nothing has been said.  Now if a white student wants to wear an anti-Obama tee shirt; he should have the same right. This is what is wrong with political correctness...it is pro-liberal and anti-conservative.  Rules like America should take in both sides...and they do...the First Amendment.  Being it was patriotism day or not.  You have the right to speak for and the right to speak against.|`|FaBiF6MNaa	Voicing opposition to your leaders is the most American thing you can do. No matter if you like Obama or not, you should have absolute right to criticize him in any way you see fit.<br>  How many time did you hear the liberals say Bush was a terrorist?<br>  Liberals do this stuff all the time to get their opinions heard. When its on the flip side, they attack you with full force.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	The question is very simple, is it protected by the First Amendment.  Personally, even though I disagree with the statement, it is protected speech as described in the First  Amendment to the Constitution.|`|89YkHxMUaa	If it was an anti Palin or Mccain they would congratulate the kid. <br>  <br>  I say the kid is just anti-communist and they need to leave him alone.

PtHThRoNaa	Just look at the answers you are getting here.  And they all claim they are not racist.<br>  I voted Obama, and I am white.<br>  Many people voted Obama because he is black.<br>  Many people DID NOT vote for Obama, because he is black.<br>  It works both ways.|`|Jsy1xsL1aa	No, if they were McCain would be President. We voted for Obama because we need a black guy in office to counter what ALL of the white Presidents have done to us. After I saw Obama not salute the flag or wear that stupid button, it opened my mind just like it did with a lot of people. Why do I have to work so hard to the rich get richer? Screw that. It's time for CHANGE ... get used to it.|`|1eb935e6100f32fd7c9a8bad9e9be568aa	Only in the black community.  Twenty percent more blacks voted than ever in history... why?  A black candidate... didn't matter who he was or what he stood for he was black,. that is racist.<br>  <br>  Indigent blacks were bussed to the polls  and paid in drugs or money... was that racist or just stupid,., I don't know.<br>  <br>  So yes.., the black community voted on race.. that was all.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	Of course,  when they have people that voted that were not suppose to vote but community organizers made sure they voted because of color, yes that is racist.|`|AA10928202	Yes, all the white haters voted. And see how well run all those african countries were after the whites were chased out. Or murdered.|`|Fy54FMemaa	What would the argument be if Hilary won?<br>  <br>  If McCain won, there would be nothing said because there would be no new news in the White House. Even tho that would have made Palin a VP, that is still not the president (thank God!)|`|tXWvoYNfaa	Yes and 99.9% of it came from McCain and the Republicans.|`|hpBFDAaGaa	Overwhelmingly so.|`|jGAX8sSlaa	Yes it is no secret that Everyone hates the white man. And were to scared to do anything about it because people will call us racist.|`|MqXbtvP9aa	it be|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Race played an enormous part in the election, thats for sure.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	Yes extremely - look at how a certain demographic who really weren't registered to vote, turned out in full force to vote.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Loaf of bread, reported.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, some in McCain's campaign were.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	No, I don't.  I think a lot of factors were involved in people's voting decisions, but for the most part, I think race was a fairly small factor.|`|LMPK5WBaaa	AMEN it was !!!
xVRGz3Oaaa	Obama has to payoff Harry Reid and the other Calif. Democrats some way, might as well call it a stimulus, especially if he considers Bee Research and Frisbee Golf courses stimulus.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	None of it is "stimulus" funding.

6wSmZrrsaa	Don't worry those same people will be crying about global warming when it's summer time. For some reason they can't think past a few months, so during winter global warming does not exists to them anymore|`|AA11518835	Some of them.<br>  <br>  Personally I think that anyone who denies evolution is a moron.<br>  <br>  I think Global Warming is real, also. I don't think it is as bad as Al Gore says it is, but it is, nonetheless, real.<br>  But in my opinion, there is much, much more evidence to support Evolution than to support Global Warming.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	No, people that think global warming is not real actually look at facts, and don't listen to everything everyone tells them.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	They deny ignorance but yes they are the same.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	You sound a bit biased and uninformed.<br>  <br>  I love science and I love reading about the science on both sides of an issue.

So there's not really much evidence of that either.|`|089e8d35b7463b74daf5b60e025ccdc5aa	Yes, they are the same people.  They believe that men and dinosaurs were on the earth at the same time.  They don't believe in scientific proofs like carbon dating.  And they aren't discerning enough to separate the message from the messenger, so since they don't like Al Gore, they throw out the scientific message.<br>  <br>  BTW, it's less confusing to the uneducated masses to call it "climate change."  They don't realize that global warming can cause temperature changes in both directions, so they get befuddled.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	no.many of the worlds top scientist do not believe we are the cause. they are more informed than you or i on the matter.not sure what that has to do with the theory of evolution. and in the last tens years there has been no warming, actually there has been some cooling, in particular, the pacific ocean.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Everyone believes global warming was happening, they simply didn't believe it was man made.<br>  <br>  I think evolution is real, but the origins of man are unproven.

Man-made climate change is a farce and the Co2 levels in the atmosphere have been much higher in the past. Often forgotten in the argument is the fact that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere. For every million molecules of other gases in the atmosphere (such as nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen), there are only 385 molecules of CO2.<br>  <br>  It is a fact that atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have varied widely over geological time. The peak was estimated to be some 20-fold higher than at present (+6,000 ppm) -- and the low about 200 ppm below today's. <br>  <br>  The entire solar system is warming right now and it is a natural cycle of the solar system.The planet Earth has been warming since the last ice age and then the cycle will repeat itself.|`|leM3RQ5Haa	You are going to find some who believe both, disbelieve both, or believe one and not the other.

Currently Earth is in a cooling trend (and don't give me that "but its winter" crap and go look at the temperature records yourself for the last 2 years) even as global warming is still being hyped. The fact is that the Earths temperature is almost fully driven by solar irradiance through sunspot activity (The sun causes temperature changes on Earth? NO WAY!) although volcano's can also have a noticeable impact on global temperature.<br>  <br>  Think of it this way, if man causes all the Earth's temperature changes then how do you explain all the ice ages and warming periods throughout Earths history?

AA10694949	Not many people realize how dangerous the situation in Pakistan  is for the United States and others in that region, however being pro-active along with diplomacy may have some up side to this very complex Issue. I rate Pakistan more of an Immediate danger to us than Iran or North Korea. Our military is now spread very thin and any military action against Pakistan will NOT do us any good in the short term. I would rather finish up with Irak before we even considering any type of military action towards them.<br>  <br>  Regarding young girls & women having an opportunity to go to school, perhaps some monetary incentive would be appropriate on that issue, even maybe start having some dialouge and getting a foot in the door.

I have found that community colleges have better value of tuition's and no pressure of recruiting the students to be in competition of the numbers 1 or 2. I have felt liberal studies/majors have given you more of broadening field careers than specific majors to start with. Specific majors seems limit the opportunity to find in the work place.<br>  <br>   With big universities, these chancellors seems to focus to make the big money off to show  who is the number one university. Don't care  what they come in for. as I feel to that.<br>  <br>  I graduated from community college then transferred to 4 years of college- state college. It led me to limited opportunities because I have chosen a specific major, not broadening or generalization major. So, it wasted my time on that, as I had to go back for another major. I wish they would focus on what is more in and out of career fields before enroll the universities or state colleges, but they focus too much of the image like redo their school with new labs or new parking lots, etc.. in this desperate times of economy, you never know what they are going to use the money for. often times I see it is more of pork projects they are looking to appeal the new students.
TYGgRjqDaa	It depends on how the prosecutor wants to handle the case.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Statutory rape implies consent from the underaged person, I believe.  If they didn't cooperate, it's forced.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	No, assuming there was one "incident" - couldnt be both. If this was a continuig situation it could be x counts of stat, and y counts of rape (once the person turned 17). <br>  PS- in response to comment above - stat rape is where the victim is below the age of consent and therefore can not give consent.

I am also a mother. However, I do feel strongly that she should not have gone AWOL. She took an oath, hopefully she had family members who could have kept her informed. I know that it was a hard decision. As a parent when your child is sick you want to be right there. But if every soldier decided to go AWOL because of a family or personal issue.... what kind of military would we have? I have to reluctantly say she deserves her dishonorable discharge.<br>  <br>  Also, everytime someone goes AWOL that puts that much more work and stress on those who are still deployed I would imagine.

Mercury fillings in teeth are still used, and when they need to be replaced mercury gas gets released and inhaled.

In elementary school, I remember that my mom had talked to one of the other parents of a girl who was basically in to see the dentist twice a week, and her mom said she had bad teeth because they removed the fluoride from the water in the district of town she lived in.

K1iUzewyaa	"welcome home Heroes" sign. Nothing really that you can bring. Just the signs and a heroes welcome.. Wear something that will reveal the newcomer.. take him somewhere far far from base, maybe the beach, disney world, disney land.. depends, because every person takes some time to get back to normal. see what he is up to doing... ok, fresh baked cookies doesn't hurt.... to answer further.. save the trip, unless he absolutely wants you all to be there. Throw are huge party for him when he gets back home. It will be a lot better. Unless he is married, I would let him go out with his friends off base. It's a good time to get back in the flow of things... If you can, and his feeling will not be hurt, don't take the trip to see him in. Use the money to throw a party in hometown.... I know when I got back just wanted to relax...|`|HaEsRdC0aa	Oh absolutely! It is a great idea to do a sign for 2 reasons. 1. The soldier. It helps them feel all welcomed and stuff. =) 2. There are so many soldiers coming in at once that the signs help them find there way through the maze. Make sure you put his rank and last name. My husband returned last March. What a blessing to you!!|`|TSpH4Ygdaa	I hope my answer isn't too crass, but most men who return from deployment  only want three (actually four..) things...<br>  a beer, a steak and some "booty", the fourth is sleep.<br>  If your brother-in-law  is married or has a girlfriend and they have children, the offer of babysitting, so he can have some alone-time with his woman, would be kind. <br>  If he isn't married or seeing anyone, throwing a party in his honor with as many cute, single girls that you can find would be nice. <br>  I would run that idea by him, though, because he may just want some time to himself. It takes some time to re-adjust to a world where everything isn't blowing up, and sometimes crowds and noise (albiet,, from well-wishing family members) can be a little too much....|`|e1vVM7p9aa	Don't go overboard, making a twenty foot banner. There are the groups of spouses that will take care of those large objects.

TYGgRjqDaa	Jennifer Granholm is brilliant and a rising star.  Sarah Palin is going to be hosting Jerry Springer in about 3 years.|`|261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Palin is a Doll and she's smarter, more morally grounded, and runs her state 1000% better than Granholm. I live in Michigan. My brother works for the state, what does he do? He's in a union and I swear to God, he tells me he is paid as a supervisor to watch paint dry. The graft and corruption here in Detroit Michigan  is almost as bad as Chicago Illinois. There is garbage in the streets Snow doesn't get plowed, People are leaving. The industries here are taxes to the point of leaving. None of that is happening in Alaska. Palin Rocks and the reason the left was so bent out of shape and spreading vicious lies about her was, they were afraid of her. The Republicans actually looked like they had a leader. This made the libs apoplectic. Palin beat Biden in debates Then they say she is stupid. Go figure?<br>  <br>   It's amazing to me. Republicans seek morality and vision, In a candidate. Democrats constantly point out each small flaw in character and Republicans stop supporting the candidate. The Democrats just assume all politicians are evil and corrupt. They vote for how much their country can do for them. They also vote for whomever will harm the rich whom they are taught, at birth, to envy. They choose the least moral of the bunch.|`|PfCga0X5aa	Jennifer Granholm has been spending her term cleaning up the mess the previous Governor has made of her state.  Palin is a Governor making a mess for someone else to clean up.|`|oE5k7P10aa	I wish Palin would come to Michigan and fix thing up.  Granholm is a dismal failure.

Palin. By the way, we could also compare the state of each of their respective states. One is operating at a huge surplus. The other? Not so much...to say the least.|`|zkovxRseaa	it gets hotter in Michigan than in Alaska, so that's your answer|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Granholm has run the state into the ground with enormous taxes on businesses, which runs them out of the state.<br>  <br>  Get this.. they implemented some sort of plan to reduce taxes on movie companies coming to make movies in the state.  It caused a surge in movie companies coming there to make movies. Here's a novel idea.  Similarly lower corporate tax rates in the state and watch as the corporations start flooding into the state. <br>  <br>  Anyway, that's the major difference.  Granholm can't run a state and Palin can.  The number of people isn't the issue. It's all about policy decisions.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Granholm seems to have great difficulty with her state, but I think she might barely edge out Palin for hotness.<br>  <br>  Of course, Granholm can never run for President or Vice-President since she's a naturalized citizen.|`|oojO4WAraa	Granholm is a better choice as a leader.

325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	1) You do not need to be a citizen to join the army.  In fact, joining can help you with getting your citizenship.<br>  <br>  2) You DO however need a citizenship to get a secret clearance, which I believe that you need to be in Special Forces.  <br>  <br>  3) You can't just sign up to be in the Green Beret.  But you can sign on as 11B - infantry - and get airborne training in your contract.  (You have to request it.  Ask a recruiter about this.)  You can also go to Ranger school, which is a prerequisite anyway.  <br>  <br>  Pay in the army is based on pay grade.  You will probably come in at E-1 or E-2.  Pay for that is about $1300 to $1500 per month.  But you have to remember that in the army you have free housing, food and medical care.  So its more like making $2500 per month or even more.  And the pay goes up quite a bit as you gain rank.  If you keep your unnecessary bills (credit cards, other toys) down, you will have plenty of money.<br>  <br>  Go check out goarmy.com and look around.  And talk to a recruiter.  If you really want to be special forces, they very much want to talk to you.|`|rJSD3iCHaa	You will most likely have your citizenship by the time you even qualify to go to the Q course, which you will have been in for 4 plus years at least.  You'll have to be a citizen to qual for a Top Secret level anyway, eventually Top Secret crypto which you will DEFINATLY have to have rock solid citizenship .  The pay for a GB is the same basic pay as any other soldier pending any Dlab pay or other specialty qual pay(Halo, etc.).  GB's get much larger re enlistment bonus incentives typically especially more senior NCOs.  Your mission frequency is completely mission dependent obviously just as any other unit in the military.  GBs main mission and traditional mission is to train foreign forces.  They are training lots of Iraq/Afgh forces, living w/them day in and day out going on missions w/them.  Special strike missions are well classified and I will not divulge that.|`|LETPAa6Oaa	Yes you have to be an American citizen. Now you can actually get special forces in your contract when you join, but it only guarantees you a spot in Special Operations Preparation Course(SOPC), then if you graduate that then you move on to the next training and so on.<br>   As for pay, it depends on your rank, you could get an enlistment bonus up to $25,000 and money for school, plus you get a $300 a month bonus for completion of airborne school.  <br>   Special Forces operators are downrange(on mission) about 6 months out of the year. The 5th Special Forces Group(SFG) is down range the most.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I think you have a long way to go to qualify for Special Forces.  Maybe you should just focus on enlisting as an Infantryman and working as hard as you can volunteering for as much additional training as possible.
6wSmZrrsaa	It shows how much they are not concerned with obama, and they don't respect him|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I agree, it's total bullshit.|`|33ppbrMJaa	This is the most ridiculous news story I have ever read.  In the first place, Bush and Cheney were itching to attack Iran. If Iranian officials had admitted publicly they were responsible for the Roadside Bombings in Iraq, you can bet that both Bush and Cheney would have leapt aboard the War Train immediately.<br>  <br>  At most, Iran has been guilty of furnishing weapons and supplies to Iraqi insurgents. Michael Ware, of CNN, says that this is a problem, but he has never said that the Iranians are the ones attacking....at least with government backing.<br>  <br>  Does anyone really believe that George Bush would condone talks with Iran?  Old Stand Tough George..."military attack is on the table" would disdain such talks completely.  <br>  <br>  I do believe that Iran wants compensation in exchange for halting its nuclear program.  It also wants assistance in instigating a peaceful modern energy system.  Since we need Iran's help to defeat or come to some kind of an understanding with the Taliban, it only makes sense that our leaders get together at the bargaining table.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	Quite frankly this sounds like a pile of brown.  Iran may or may not be helping the Freedom Fighters {  ;-) } in Iraq but Iran certainly doesn't want the B'aath Party back in charge that invaded Iran in the 1980s.  On the other hand they don't want a leader who would bow to the Americans who have been promoting another invasion of Iran for no good reason.  In the Middle east it is not comfortable having the rogue Americans constantly at your doorstep especially when they continually but into your business and threaten to nuke (listen to Fox) Iran turning it into glass.|`|zji1Dkruaa	Hey that's Not Fair , I was Gonna say "i  think it is bull$hit"<br>  but it Seems u Got that :D<br>  Totally Agreed , that's one of the worst Methods of Brainwashing by Western Biased Media Ive recently Seen,<br>  They Desperately Try to Proof themselves by these Kiddish Plots ! <br>  Worse than that is the fact that Some people Actually Take this Joke Serious !<br>  "U let us Make Nuke we stop Killing you" ,  L.O.L|`|zI3YXvGLaa	what is going on now is that Russia is negotiating with the US over the missile bases in Poland etal.

They are just here to bash.|`|AA11518835	I agree with you. The plans haven't succeeded or failed, yet.<br>  <br>  But it seems very evident to many people, including myself, that the plans are going to fail, and fail dramatically.<br>  <br>  You can't get out of a problem caused by borrowing and spending by borrowing and spending. The economy does not work that way.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	The far right has no credibility because they have consistently reported misinformation as if it were fact . . all they do is repeat the same nonsense they hear from right wing talk shows or Fox news . . they rarely read facts . . just repeat gossip, commentary, and opinion. No facts. (I don't think even one Republican knows that the woman in Kenya they keep calling his 'grandmother' is not related to him biologically. That they are related by marriage only . . lol.)<br>  <br>  That is why no one and I mean no one in this country is taking Republicans seriously at all. They cried 'wolf' too many times and continue to be the gloom and doom party . . just read some of the answers here . . lol . . 'this is the end' . . 'the sky is falling' . . . .lol.  It's hard to take any of them seriously.|`|GfIwCC6saa	Every single economist have stated this plan will fail. Do you think they  damaged there credibility for later?|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	And how long would you like to wait?<br>  It only damages a person's credibility if their conclusion about Obama right now proves to be incorrect.<br>  So far, most of the conclusions about his pork-filled stimulus plan have been spot on.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	You know full well when the turnaround begins those same people will claim it had nothing to do with President Obama but it was either the natural course of business or because of the brilliant" plans bush had put into place.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	A bad idea is a bad idea.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	It doesn't take time for a bill to fail when the failure is written into it. If this was an honest attempt at stimulating the economy, I would agree that we need to wait and see how it works. However, the bill is full of obvious Democrat wish lists for projects they've been wanting for years.  Stimulating the economy isn't as simple as just tossing money at things. It needs to be a very well thought out and targetted injection of money at just the right places to give a short term and long term boost without significant drawbacks. <br>  <br>  If someone asks you what your favorite fruit is, you might say pineapple and somewhat else might say oranges.  This Stimulus bill is the equivalent of answering with "pancakes".  That's why it's easy to point it out as a failure immediately.  It's a bill not 100% written with the economy in mind.  It's 30% stimulus, 50% dream projects that may get some money into the economy if you're lucky, and 20%  what the heck is this doing in the bill. It's 100% inefficient use of hundreds of $billions of taxpayer money.<br>  <br>  It's also a failure because Obama failed to give us all the 5 days he promised we'd have to review the bill online before he signed it.  His excuse is that there is no time to wait on this bill. Okay.. why then did he have to wait all weekend to sign and the fly all the way to Denver to sign it in front of some solar panels?  Why couldn't he just sign it Friday night immediately after it was passed if it was that critical?|`|DypTl9Zdaa	Well I am going to say no because thus far Obama has been unable to follow many of his campaign promises and has failed in many ways due to those reasons alone.  It isn't hard to lack credibility 10 years later when you are still paying high taxes because of the trillion dollar stimulus package that more than likely will not do anything to stimulate the economy.

In this particular case, the House <br>  Ways and Means Committee was the House Committee, <br>  which means when it went to the Senate, it probably <br>  was reviewed be the Senate Finance Committee, which <br>  is the Senate's equivalent to Ways and Means.  <br>    <br>  During World War II, there was a hemp cultivation <br>  project to help the war effort.  Industrial hemp products <br>  are best produced from plants that are cultivated to <br>  maximize the production of stems and seeds.  <br>    <br>  By the way, most of the world calls it hemp or cannabis.   <br>  Marijuana was a derogatory term used by the forces <br>  seeking to outlaw cannabis for recreational purposes.

Quit trying to ruin peoples lives just so you can get some free money.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Yes, you absolutely can.  If he told you it was Restylane, and then he used something else, that is fraudulent and treatment without consent.  A good attorney would have a field day with it.  Restylane is too new to have a generic counterpart, and if you paid for Restylane, substituting something else that may not even be FDA approved is grounds for a terrific lawsuit.  I would also go to another doctor and find out if the fake stuff has even been approved, because it may have dangerous side effects if it is sham filler.  The fake stuff causes all kinds of medical problems.  <br>  <br>  Call your state bar and ask for a referral for an attorney that handles those types of cases.<br>  <br>  Of course he's going to try and argue they are the same thing, but that won't hold water.  First, he charged you for Restylane, which is highly expensive for a reason- people want Restylane and there are not substitutes.  That's a damage in itself- he needs to reimburse you the money you paid for Restylane, which you didn't get.  Second, he violated the law by telling you he was treating you with one thing and then using something else.  That's a violation of the doctor-patient relationship, and since he didn't ask you if it was ok to use a "South American" version of it, he'll lose.  You should also contact the Medical Board and report him.  I don't doubt he has other complaints like this.  Get an attorney.  They'll tear him to pieces for malpractice.  When you have to have surgery to correct a lousy doctor's mistake, he doesn't have much to argue.  Also, attorneys love papertrails, and since you have medical records of the work you had to have done to fix his mess, they can prove damages in court.  All those costs are damages.  If you had to miss work to get medical treatment from the injuries he caused, those are damages. You have a very solid case.  He sounds like a sheister trying to use sheister arguments.  They won't work for a second.

rYE9VLQdaa	In my opinion the reason it is illegal now is because of misconceptions about the dangers of cannabis and by that I mean it is mainly viewed view as a gateway drug leading to more dangerous drugs. In fact, there is no solid evidence of marijuana being a gateway drug anymore than alcohol is. However, because of its illegal status users of marijuana are also exposed to harder physically addictive drugs. In my opinion it is the illegal status of marijuana that is the gateway. This would be solved by legalization.<br>  <br>  I also believe that part of the reason it remains illegal is that, in our mostly protestant society, it is viewed as immoral to use an artificial substance in order to feel good. That is, hard work and honest living should be what makes you feel good and nothing else.<br>  <br>  Another reason it remains illegal is because drug dealers and drug manufacturers are frequently evil and violent people, killing people who get in thier way. This also would be solved by legalization.<br>  <br>  Some people believe that drug use would increase with legalization, but as with end of prohobiton of alcohol this does not actually happen. You only need to look at the drug use rates in Holland to see that drug use amongst high school students is much lower than ours and amongst adults about the same.<br>  <br>  As far as why it was made illegal, a lot of the misconceptions about the dangers cannabis came about from the owners of paper and textile manufacturers. Hemp, which had a very low THC level anyway, can be used to make both. Per what I have read it is actually much cheaper also. Hemp is much easier to harvest in greater quantities than lumber and provides more usable fibers per acre than cotton.<br>  <br>  Based on the results of decriminalization in the Netherlands I would have to say that legalization would mean a lower drug use rate amongst teenagers in the US and, if it were taxed a source of revenue for the government. People do say that the government will not be able to tax it because it is so easily grown but there is a simple remedy for that. Right now it is illegal to make a still for producing your own hard liqueur so it must be bought at the store. You must be licensed to own and operate a still. So my solution is simply to require a license to grow cannabis.<br>  <br>  The government would also save a significant amount of money from the legalization of cannabis. Right now we spend an average of around $22,000 dollars per marijuana arrest.  In 2007 the US had 872,271 arrests for marijuana.  That is 19,189,962,000 spent on a drug that is, arguably, only dangerous because of it’s illegal status.|`|LzPhdri5aa	It was made illegal for the same reason we once made alcohol illegal.

Intoxication produces dose-related impairments in a wide range of cognitive and behavioral functions that are relevant to a skilled performance like driving an automobile or operating machinery. These include: slowed reaction time and information processing, impaired perceptual-motor coordination and motor performance, impaired short term memory, signal detection, tracking behavior and slowed time perception. (Chait and Pierri, 1992).<br>  <br>  The negative effects of cannabis on the performance of psycho-motor tasks is almost always related to dose (Chait and Pierri, 1992). The effects are generally larger, more consistent and persistent in different tasks which involve sustained attention. The acute effects of "recreational" doses of cannabis on driving performance in laboratory simulators and over standardized driving courses are similar to those of doses of alcohol that achieve BACs between 0.07% and 0.10% (Hansteen, Miller, Lonero, Reid and Jones, 1976; Peck et al, 1986; Smiley, 1986).<br>  <br>  There is reasonably consistent evidence that THC can produce cellular changes such as alterations in cell metabolism, and DNA synthesis, in vitro (Bloch, 1983). There is even stronger evidence that cannabis smoke is mutagenic in vitro, and in vitro, and hence, that it is potentially carcinogenic for the same reasons as tobacco smoke (Leuchtenberger, 1983).<br>  <br>  The conclusion reached by the Institute of Medicine in 1982 still stands: the smoking of marijuana "causes changes to the heart and circulation that are characteristics of stress.<br>  <br>  Chronic heavy cannabis smoking impairs the functioning of the large airways, and probably causes symptoms of chronic bronchitis such as coughing, sputum, and wheezing (Bloom et al, 1987; Huber et al, 1988; Tashkin et al, 1988a, 1990). Given the documented adverse effects of tobacco smoke which is qualitatively very similar in composition to cannabis smoke (Tashkin, 1993; Wu et al, 1988). There is as yet little direct evidence that the latter occurs (Huber et al, 1988) although there is evidence that chronic cannabis smoking may produce histopathological changes in lung tissues of the kind that precede the development of lung cancer (Fligiel et al, 1988).<br>  <br>  Chronic cannabis use disrupts the male and female reproductive systems in animals, reducing the secretion of testosterone, and sperm production, motility, and viability in males, and disrupting the ovulatory cycle in females (Bloch, 1983; Institute of Medicine, 1982). <br>  <br>  Because cannabis is an illegal drug its cultivation, harvesting and distribution are not subject to quality control mechanisms to ensure the reliability and safety of the product used by consumers.<br>  <br>  One of the major concerns about the psychological effects of chronic heavy cannabis use has been that it impairs adult motivation. The evidence for an "amotivational syndrome" among adults consists largely of case histories and observational reports (e.g. Kolansky and Moore, 1971; Millman and Sbriglio, 1986).<br>  <br>  In the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, cannabis use appears to have increased the risk of discontinuing a high school education, and of experiencing job instability in young adulthood (Newcombe and Bentler, 1988). The apparent strength of these relationships in cross-sectional studies (e.g. Kandel, 1984) has been exaggerated because those adolescents who are most likely to use cannabis have lower academic aspirations and poorer high school performance prior to using cannabis than their peers who do not (Newcombe and Bentler, 1988).<br>  <br>  A cannabis dependence syndrome as defined in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) can occur in heavy, chronic users of cannabis. There is good experimental evidence that chronic heavy cannabis users can develop tolerance to its subjective and cardiovascular effects. There is also suggestive evidence that some users may experience a withdrawal syndrome on the abrupt cessation of cannabis use, although one that is much milder and less marked than that experienced when withdrawing from alcohol or opiates (Compton, Dewey and Martin, 1990; Jones and Benowitz, 1976). <br>  <br>  To say marijuana is not legal now because of governments inability to control...then turn around and say government would make billions of dollars in tax collection is contradictory. Yet, these are common arguments for legalization.<br>  <br>  Granted there are worse drugs in the streets compared to marijuana, but to legalize the illicit drugs using the rationale that people should be allowed to decide for themselves is absurd. Absurd because of the current illicit drug problems today, even though the drugs are illegal, we still have a continuing problem with crime that results from illicit drug use. People break in to homes to steal property for drug money. People engage in behavior which is dangerous to others around them.<br>  <br>  Be it mar|`|AA10240904	It has always been illegal going way back to before WWII, but some states have modified their laws to include misdemeanor for small amounts and ability to use it for doctor approved medical uses.

It is from Joe Rogan's blog <a href="http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/454" rel="nofollow">http://blog.joerogan.net/archives/454</a><br>  <br>  Joe Rogan's open letter to Kellogs regarding Michael Phelps<br>  <br>  Dear, Kellogg’s.<br>  <br>  I’m writing this letter to express my disappointment in your company in firing Michael Phelps as a spokesperson for your products because he was photographed while enjoying some marijuana.<br>  <br>  I respectfully would like to communicate my opinion on this matter because I think it’s of great public interest.<br>  <br>  First of all, although it is true that Mr. Phelps broke the law, I think any reasonably intelligent person would admit that it’s one of the most ****** up and corrupt laws that we have today in this country. Marijuana is relatively harmless and certainly far less dangerous than a host of other things that are not only legal but also readily available, like alcohol and prescription drugs. The only reason it remains illegal to this day is because it’s a plant and you can’t patent it and control it’s sale, and because if it were legal it would greatly affect the demand for a host of prescription drugs that rake in billions of dollars each year for pharmaceutical companies.<br>  That’s it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Marijuana has never killed anyone EVER in over 10,000 years of use. We’re not protecting people from themselves, we’re not saving the children - it’s just a horribly illogical law that is in place because of corruption and propaganda.<br>  The fact that it’s against the law is just a disgusting reminder of how retarded our system is, not a reasonable reaction to a proven threat to society. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I have to say, this whole thing saddens me, because I personally would like to think that as Americans we’re better than this. These television news anchors will shake their heads at the thoughtless mistake Mr. Phelps had made by “smoking dope,” and then without even the tiniest sense of irony they will cut to a beer commercial.<br>  This is supposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, right? We’re not supposed to be a nation of little bitches giving in to the whims of corrupt politicians and the pharmaceutical companies who’s interests they’re representing.<br>  <br>  It’s 2009, and in this day and age with the incredible access to information that we have available there’s no ******* way that we should be allowing human beings to tell other human beings that they can’t do something that they enjoy that hurts no one including themselves.<br>  <br>  THAT is madness. THAT is ignorant, and THAT is completely ******* un-American. <br>  <br>  <br>  I don’t want to hear any of that, “he’s setting a bad example with the children” nonsense either, because we all know if he had a gin and tonic in his hand instead of a bong this would never have been an issue, even though every single study ever done has shown that marijuana is FAR less dangerous than alcohol.<br>  <br>  Marijuana laws are a horrible waste of resources and law enforcement, and especially in this day and age with our economy in such horrible shape I believe the last thing we need to be doing is wasting tax payers’ money on any of this victimless bullshit. <br>  I find your reactions to Mr. Phelps situation both ignorant and short sighted.<br>  <br>  I think what would have been a far better response from Kellogg’s would be to support Mr. Phelps, and perhaps point out that maybe we as a society should take a closer look at the evidence and possibly reconsider our position on this misunderstood plant that so many of our productive citizens find useful.<br>  <br>  Now, I’m sure if you really were running Kellogg’s and you were still reading my bullshit all the way down to this, you must be thinking, “Why the hell would we stick our necks out like that for pot smokers?”<br>  And of course the answer to that question would be, because we buy your ****, ************.<br>  <br>  Do you guys even know your consumer statistics? Well, let me fill you in on some of my own personal scientific research on the subject, because I have been closely studying my own purchases for over 20 years, and I can tell you that I’ve been high 100% of the time I’ve bought your ****. <br>  <br>  <br>  I mean, do you guys ever think about what you sell?<br>  Pop tarts? Are you kidding me? I would be willing to bet that 50% of the people buying pop tarts are stoned out of their ******* minds. <br>  Just to be perfectly clear on my position, I would like you to know that I enjoy your products. I think many of them are quite tasty, but lets be honest; you guys sell sugar-drenched **** that’s horrible for your body - in fact, it’s actually way worse for your body than pot - and you market this **** specifically to children.<br>  <br>  You assholes go as far as putting lovable cartoon characters on the boxes just so that kids will beg their parents for it.<br>  Now, I don’t want you to misunderstand my point, because I in no way want anything bad to happen to your company. Like I said, I genuinely enjoy your products.<br>  <br>  There’s nothing quite like being stoned out of your mind at 2am

So yes, there are some white people out there that resent the blacks.  Not because of their color, but because of the seemingly special treatment that they receive. Blacks were treated so badly for so long that now everyone bends over backwards to make them superior.  Stop and think about it.  Do white people have a special college fund just for their specific race?  No.  Do white people yell racial discrimination every time a black police officer gives them a ticket?  No.  Even if they did, they couldn't get away with taking it to court like a black person can.  They would get laughed out of the courthouse if they even tried.  If a white man gets laid off of a job before the black man standing next to him, can he make a case for racial discrimination?  No.  That's just a few example for you to ponder.  As for the color of the president, WHO CARES?   I don't care what color he is as long as he does his job right!

This is called pay-back.<br>  <br>  Did you know that those people who are working and paying the most taxes in order to pay for the 50% of the people who won't work and are on welfare, are getting their taxes increased?

I would have voted for Condi Rice . . . . and she is black, . . so opposing Obama is not a race thing.<br>  <br>  Second . . . is Obama black.  Well, his mom is white.  His dad is black.  So he is both.  If he wants to be identified as African-American, that's cool with me.  Peace.<br>  <br>  Third, . . . black people get what they want but white people don't.  He may be referring to "affirmative action" which is, guess what?  Reverse discrimination.  It wasn't cool that blacks were kept out of Med School JUST because they were black . .. when they had HIGHER scores back in the day . . . . . but it is EQUALLY uncool to keep a white kid out of Med School if his scores are higher than a black guy's (or woman's) scores.<br>  <br>  So . . . basically . . . . affirmative action is just discrimination going YOUR direction.

They do not owe you anything.|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	Why was Mistydew obligated to let someone who would work hard for less have her job?  Are business owners the only ones who are permitted to be profit driven?  What would you say about a business owner who thought that way?  The ownership equivalent would be:  "If I can't afford to pay my workers a salary they can live a decent life on, I shouldn't have any workers.  I should have to do everything myself."|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	No, most business owners don't exploit their workers; however many business owners don't appreciate their employees either. I remember when I had my first job, I was a waitress at a small cafe, the owner totally took advantage of me she used to make all the waiters and waitress split their tips with her, and we never saw a dime of the credit card tips. To top it off I was late once because my sister was in the hospital and the woman yelled at me in front of customers, I was only 15years old. I think a lot of small business owners don't really pay attention to the needs of their employees, and frankly you probably don't pay them enough, (due to my experience with my first job) when I was a teen and in college if the job paid less then $17.00 an hour I didn't strive to go out of my way for my boss. (it was not worth my time or money)|`|3ixmHSwmaa	I am also a small businessperson. I'm coming out of pocket every month for pay and haven't layed anyone off yet.

What these "people" fail to realize is that if there is no company to work for because it went out of business, then there can be no more jobs!

cgbNGef5aa	You need to study for the ASVAB - think about it this score will determine what you will do not only the next 6 years but potentially your carrier for the next 10-20 years! Don't make the mistake of thinking you can change what you signed up for later. Do it right from the start. More training options and career choices with higher scores.<br>  <br>  So to get a better score you need to study. The guide that we got for my son was ASVAB FOR DUMMIES it has a cd with practice tests and a great study book.  Besides practicing you need to know how to score better based on what you got wrong.  This guide will help.<br>  <br>  Military websites also has free practice tests online.<br>  <br>  Use the websites below to read my son's story - he joined in August and completes SOI training this week and comes home!!! Yeah!<br>  Anyways the websites tell his story and what he realized he should have done as well as letters from home.  The other site gives information about boot camp graduation - share with your parents to give them a heads up on it!  Dozens of links to more information also listed. Do you know what career you want yet? Start searching to find out what score you need.  <br>  <br>  Please send me an email with questions and I will ask my son to reply next week when he is here.

Pay particular attention to the math and science parts.  Study hard, bro.  You don't need to pick up your score all that much to qualify 11B (respect for that MOS btw.)  <br>  <br>  If you can pull your score up to a 60 you shouldn't have any problems.  Are you a junior now?  Are you on track to graduate?  Brushing up on your math and memorizing some science facts and principles (which is all they test you on) should get you there.  <br>  <br>  The guide also has tips on how to "guess well" since all the questions are multiple choice.  IE - watch out for answers that have "always" or "never", use process of elimination to get rid of the obviously wrong answers to improve your odds, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you are a slow reader, be sure to get your eyes checked.  I knew a guy who was pretty smart and trying to get in the airforce, but he needed reading glasses and refused to wear them.  Screwed up his test bad.  He probably should have been over 50, but he ended up getting 35 cause he couldn't read well with his eyesite.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS - OH, go to Military.com and take their practice exams to judge your progress.   You can probably go from 46 to 60 in about two to four weeks with study.  And if you know someone good at math have them help you with that crap.|`|jeLehwmpaa	there is great book it cost like 15 buck on amazon its called asvab for dummies i got it and it really helped me out it explains everything and give you practice tests and good test taking skills.  i scored a 78 on my asvab after getting this book|`|TWtYdYLHaa	go to your local library, they'll have books to help you, i would just go 11b im a specialist in artillery right now, im re-classin to 19d in may, thats the real fun stuff, look it up you might change your mind,|`|jGAX8sSlaa	There are Asvab study guides available at most book stores.

WH Smith sell numerous puzzle and IQ books too (my favourite was "Know your IQ". All useful to get the grey matter moving.<br>  You really can improve your IQ, because many of the IQ puzzles are recognizing patterns (numbers, words or shapes): once you've got the knack, you'll find those questions much easier to tackle.<br>  Your English comprehension cannot be easily increased in the short term, but you can improve through similar exercises.<br>  Make a physical fitness plan - you'll be more active and sharper, with more energy.<br>  On the military side, go back to the AFCO (Armed Forces Recruiting Office) and ask for some tips from the Sgt or Officer Commanding (shows willing and that you're committed).<br>  Join a forum for military selection and talk to other like you. Some will be in the same boat and you can share tips and experiences (try here first: <a href="http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/frm/f/1021981795" rel="nofollow">http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/...</a> and ask for "preparation sources". <br>  For the military, you can never be too prepared - that's a quality they'll look for in you anyway. There'll be an increase in applicants with the current economic climate - so prepare better and be the best!<br>  Best of luck with your next application.

If he had been able to hold onto it long enough, it would have reverted to the federal government and we would not have gotten any more.

BRyRtQSvaa	Depends on circumstances, a crewman with an artillery outfit is unarmed, but I wouldn't let him go. Carpet bombing started in Vietnam in the jungles on known NVA and Vietcong positions and camps. It can't be used today because of where the war is, to close to civilians!|`|ck1wvh91aa	I guess it has always depended on the situation, although it is always an undesirable tragedy. Unfortunately, it almost always happens on both sides of any conflict. You could make a case that Allied carpetbombing and firebombing during WWII was unjustified, but it is a tough call when such total war has been waged on both sides and with the stakes are so high.  Dresden was probably unnecessary and the Japanese were talking surrender when the atom bomb was dropped (it was more of a statement to the Russians), but it isn't always so black and white. I would not have wanted to be in FDR or Truman' s shoes when faced with such decisions.|`|qUDas0R4aa	Im pretty sure your not supposed to shoot an unarmed man, although in WWII and Vietnam, U.S soldiers got away with it a lot of the time because nobody seemed to care or turn them in because they literally hated these people and not to mention they weren't nearly as strict about it then as they are today|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	He stopped an enemy from murdering helpless men.

qlduZDO3aa	We were in limbo since November, I agree.  I don't necessarily blame Bush for that, though.  We have an awfully long lag period between Election Day and Inauguration Day.  2 1/2 months of a power vacuum in a financial crises is to blame.  Bush was a lame duck who could not enforce anything, yet Obama had no real power.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	>The difference was that he didn't have to ask for bailout funds since he was already working with a surplus.<br>  <br>  It's been proven that there was no "clinton surplus" when Bush took office.

Today, gas is $1.79 -see what happens when you do nothing?|`|XTDeAfTqaa	I agree that doing nothing is the wrong thing but what Obama is doing is trying to Socialize or Nationalize everything in sight. Carter's attempt at this was a complete failure. Why try it again?<br>  Obama has ulterior motives besides saving the economy. He has hijacked the Census and will attempt to make this country a one party system.<br>  Can you say Dictatorship?<br>  I knew you could.|`|318386389c51a5739cd225edcf165aaeaa	Because 90% of the Economic Destruction Act of 2009 is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!  There is no constitutional, therefor no legal, authority, for throwing more money at the failed government school system, sexually transmitted disease prevention, health care, housing, job training/placement or most of the rest of the alleged "stimuli" in the bill.  The federal politicians should learn to just get out of the way, reduce federal regulation (interference) and let the market take care of itself.

It wasn't right for Bush and it's not right for Obama.|`|NzKNNFwIaa	The markets would eventually work out some of this.  The policies that Obama and the Democrats in the Senate and House are proposing will actually HARM OUR ECONOMY.  That is why many Americans would prefer that they do NOTHING.  Your comments about Bush not borrowing money since he started witha surplus are ignorant.  The Clinton surplus meant that for one or two years the government didn't spend more in a given year than it took in for that year.  The national DEBT still existed and was huge.  <br>  <br>  Bush spent too much - no question about that.  The spending on defense and national security was fine.  The non-defense spending increases were inexcusable (and were a key reason that we ran deficits).  Tax revenues increased tremendously under Bush as a result of the tax cuts and the positive impact the tax cuts had on employment levels.  <br>  <br>  Obama is planning to increase government spending by astronomical levels (but NOT on defense and national security).  He wants to spend it on a bunch of piddly little pork projects that will likely never generate much in the way of job growth.  <br>  <br>  Obama is an incompetent IDIOT.|`|f4RnGIeSaa	You can say "don't say running up debt" but that is the real problem.  Obama promised us he was going to cut spending, and then came out with this joke of a stimulus package which will do nothing at all to really help the economy.<br>  <br>  So what he in essence is doing is spending hundreds of billions of dollars that won't fix anything all the while telling us this is his master plan that will save us all.<br>  <br>  It would be much better to leave the money where it was then to spend it unwisely.|`|P0g2xSFsaa	In a capitalistic society, a free market has ups and downs and will eventually recover itself.  That's what America is.  Through impatience and ignorance, Obama thinks throwing money at the problem will fix it, but it is simply a band-aid, and does not allow for real healing.  And it costs a lot of money.  But most importantly, Obama is attaching strings to all that money - and getting rid of a lot of free choice, and free market.  He is trying to micro-manage the economy instead of allowing a natural recovery, which would stand the test of time much better than this stimulous package.|`|kml4wGw4aa	I think you and Sarah Palin need to get together....you sound just like her.....LOL.|`|HizAP9Z8aa	In reviewing the Simulus Package, the Government Accounting Office concluded that, while it may offer marginal help in the short term, doing nothing would have been better by 2010.  <br>  <br>  I likewise was in complete disagreement with Bush's outrageous deficit spending.  <br>  <br>  The way we are handling this is like people who, seeing a fire, reach for the nearest liquid to put the fire out.  In the case of the bailouts, that liquid happens to be kerosene.  And when the fire gets bigger, they dump even more kerosene on it.  At this rate, the fire will only go out when we cannot get any more kerosene, and the market equalizes itself. This is something that government cannot do.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The Republicans should have a ready answer for this question.|`|JthubNIsaa	How can you say we aren't doing anything?

If you look at it in that light the answer is obvious. <br>  What ever Obama is doing is not working. Right now you cannot buy a job. The stock market is a 12 year lows. This is not the change I hoped for!|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	I think we need a little government "boost" in this situation.

But I am not president, so my opinion doesn't matter.|`|ciqAXgCgaa	bush had debt and now obama does, and barack isn't fixing it.|`|M3maZgdyaa	The simplest way is your life.<br>  If you make 2,000 a month and your bills are 2,500. Do you borrow money to pay your bills? By doing this you now have another bill to pay. <br>  <br>  Or do you downsize and live within your means? This way when you get credit to buy something it will be something you might enjoy. Like furniture.And you can afford the extra bill. <br>  <br>  For this ONE year we have indebted ourselves for centuries. This is not  the legacy we need to leave. We have other alternatives. Rather than borrowing money that we can't afford to repay. <br>  <br>  No matter how great the economy gets we will never get out of recession, our debt is to large.<br>  <br>  I would downsize. America has done this through unemployment. We would have eventually have righted our economy. The way we are doing it now , we can't right our country.<br>  <br>  To many companies leaving the US because of the stimulus.<br>  Their taxation with this economy made it impossible to afford to be here. <br>  <br>  They also don't want the Government to own their companies in the new Nationalization program. <br>  <br>  The housing was a Government controlled problem. That was the problem. The government bankrupted it.

I find it ironic that politicians, who set their own salaries, want to limit what others make. Those who don't work in business believe their thinking is superior to  those who actually employee people and produce products and services. Is it any wonder that the Obama administration protestations of 'helping' have caused nothing but consternation in the markets? <br>  <br>  Yes these people are living in a fantasy land.The New Deal did not magically solve unemployment. They also have short memories. The falsehoods (and I am being generous) that are being spread are nothing but fear mongering. This article points out that todays unemployment is 7.6%, not good, but far from the worst 'economy calamity since the Great Depression'.  In 1980 unemployment was 13.58%! Inflation was 7.62%, today it is 3.85%. I was only a little kid then, but I remember, that was a bad economy.<br>  <br>  This 'stimulus' is nothing more than relieving misery by making everyone equally miserable. Good idea? Hell no! <br>  <br>  As a side note. Obama is going to announce tomorrow how the is going to 'cut' 500 billion in spending by 2011. That shouldn't be hard since he just added over $1 trillion to it!

ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	I believe that the current financial "crisis" was contrived and allowed to happen in order to shift power to a New World Economy because that is what has already happened.

How can anybody trust institutions that do that?  This is not news, or at least it shouldn't be.

In the 1930s, the building was restored by the City of Charleston as a Works Progress Administration project. During this project, a large section was constructed behind the hotel containing a stage and auditorium characteristic of the 18th century. The renovated building took the name of a 1730s theater which stood on the Queen Street (formerly Dock Street) side of the property. This theater is said to have been the first building built specifically for theatrical performances in America. Planter's Hotel occasionally housed one of the city's theatrical troupes, which performed at the nearby New Theatre during the mid-19th century. The most notable actor of this troupe was Junius Brutus Booth. Booth was the patriarch of an outstanding family of actors, which included John Wilkes Booth, President Lincoln's assassin. Junius Booth, who stayed at the Planter's Hotel, allegedly tried to kill his manager here in 1838. Today the Dock Street Theatre is home to the Charleston Stage Company, a community theater group, and houses the city's Cultural Affairs office as well as The City Gallery, an exhibition space for local artists.
G7SmEfLdaa	I don't know what your political positions are and I really don't care, but  Obama has already failed as a president, in a big way.  It took about 5 years before we could officially declare George Bush a failure. But I think Obama would be way out of line by quoting any of the founding fathers (and by extension, Lincoln),  because they would probably all strongly disagree with him on any issue point about the economy or foreign policy. But soon taxpayers will own more of citigroup, and the eventual goal is the complete nationalization of some financial institutions with "toxic" assets.

Obama and the liberal Democrats are the most immediate "clear and present danger" America has.  Associating himself with a truly great man like Lincoln is a bad joke -- I can't think of one thing that Obama the Democrat and Lincoln the Republican would agree on, policy-wise.  Lincoln was strong everywhere that Obama is weak.  Not one of Obama's ancestors were even slaves in America, ever, so it's all propaganda.<br>  <br>  And Norway, and every other European socialist country, can only afford to be socialist for two reasons:  1) incredibly high taxes on EVERYBODY, not just "the rich" and 2) they cheap out on their own national defense with little token militaries because they know that good ol' Uncle Sam will come to their rescue if anybody attacks them, which allows them to pour down the rathole of socialized welfare all the money they'd have to spend on their own defense if the USA wasn't helping defend them.<br>  <br>  ducky, and all you other libiots too:  if you like the way socialist Norway does things so much, move there and enjoy the high tax rates now instead of trying to drag me and MY USA down into your socialist hell.

I even hadd the financial aid admin. at the school tell me that had she but in the PELL Grant application that I was black and not white that the system would accept it. I myself only made $3,000 a year at the time, and apparently I made too much money to qualify for anything. So, yes people are working poor.

AA12185092	Unfortunately, nothing in politics has to make sense. In the late 60s and early 70s there was a huge drug subculture, and many of us thought our generation would sweep away the old rules when it came to power. Instead, there was a backlash from the social conservatives, and we got the War on Drugs. Plus, all the straight-arrow drones got busy and worked their way into positions of power while the cool people were off at Dead concerts. <br>  <br>  Even though a sizable minority have tried cannabis, they're still a minority. Many in the majority still believe the anti-drug propaganda. Any pro-pot statement on YA will be met with multiple warnings that marijuana causes brain damage, lung cancer, insanity, and heroin addiction.<br>  <br>  On the plus side, though, there does appear to be more serious interest in changing the laws, even from your parents' generation. There are people like LEAP, for example, who are comparing our current drug policies to Prohibition. If change does come, it will need the support of the older establishment as well as that of the younger generation.|`|b1C3xs3Jaa	It must be legalized now.<br>  <br>  It is the logical path to not only expand personal freedom and liberty, but to generate income, and effectively cut spending, cut crime, cut illegal activities between mexico and usa, cut gang activity and power, and remove the rampant theft of private property from civil forfeiture.<br>  <br>  During the depression, prohibition was repealed. It reduced crime immediately.<br>  <br>  Now, it allows prisons to be uncluttered, it allows police to reprioritize, allowing states to reduce law enforcement budgets GREATLY, and it allows possible great avenues of revenue from taxation to hemp (the newest super crop for american farmers).<br>  <br>  I have faith Obama will open his eyes regarding 'the war on drugs', and end it. The time to benefit from it now is greater than ever as ending it allows money to be saved, AND made at the same time.<br>  <br>  Knowing the socialistic adventures favored by allot of people, it would create allot of funding avenues for local health or school programs.<br>  <br>  <br>  -----------<br>  <br>  Kids now have grown up seeing things, or hearing things about marijuana. There are real experiences, first or second hand, and propaganda. Those kids are influenced by a drive for moral authority - policing others non violent activities, vs those who support personal freedom and liberty. <br>  <br>  Some see ones peaceful behavior worthy of physical combating (the use of law), others dont.<br>  <br>  I think kids now sway towards more freedom, no matter how 'connected' they get regarding surveillance underneath our massively expanding government.<br>  <br>  Again, only pros, as hemp will offer paths of future energy and manufacturing in america, an area of great interest in young people.|`|FKR45WLPaa	I think that it is the next logical crop.

There was a case several years ago where a kid attending a private school got a miniscule grant from government that the school didn't even know about, the cash went from government to the student.  With the starter leech infested in the school,  a swarm of leeching bureaucrats descended on the place and said it had to comply with all of the federal regulations, etc. that governed government schools.

That would be penalizing the licensed gun owners, causing even more of them to disarm, while the criminals have more and more weapons.  That's backward thinking.

No.  <br>  <br>  Will insurance prevent a negligent discharge or discourage it from happening? NO. As long as we don't prosecute the individual who commits the crime, instead of the gun manufacturer, we'll always have this debate. News flash.

Anyone who wishes to break into your home and do harm to you and your family will no longer have to worry about being in danger themselves.<br>  <br>  What happened to Obama's promises during the campaign? He promised not to go after gun owners if he was elected, even though he's tried to pass this sort of legislation in the past. He's a liar and a fraud.<br>  <br>  Wake up people! Don't allow these people to take away your rights. The next thing to go will be your freedom of speech, or maybe your right to a fair trial. Look at the big picture. Even if you're not a gun owner, this will eventually affect you.|`|ujIinLzGaa	No, because, in the U.S., you have a greater chance of dying from being struck by lightning than from a fatal gun accident.  There are about 700 fatal gun accidents in the US each year.  About 1300 people die from lightning strikes each year.  And 120,000 people die from doctors' mistakes each year.  Considering that there are 80 million gun owners in the US, 700 fatal accidents each year is pretty good.  There are only 800,000 doctors in the US, so 120,000 fatal mistakes from that group is obviously a much bigger problem.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	No - but any criminal caught harming someone with an illegal gun should receive the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Why should a responsible gun-owner be punished endlessly?|`|W0VL46gDaa	Ahh snuffing out the innocent gun owners... how lovely. <br>  <br>  <br>  All I hve to say is...

Obama's followers deny it left and right saying that his website say...<br>  <br>  During the second debate, Obama stated that he only intends to pull troops out of Iraq for the sole purpose of sending there somewhere else to go to war.  Guess where that is?  Even McCain replied to his comment about him "showing his hand" to the enemy about not knowing anything about sending troops into a war zone.  Yet, liberals claim they are "so concerned" about not having anyone else dieding on a battlefield but their god goes and tells our enemy prepare for the invading to come!  What a hypocrite!  What an idiot!<br>  <br>  But before NObama was elected, his Jones' Town followers claimed that they wanted us out of all the wars.

0s30aQC6aa	The Marine Corps doesn't care what threats some guys wife is making to divorce him. If he's to be deployed then they will deploy him. Thats it. They can't have their manpower needs challenged by unstable wives! War comes before personal lives. Thats something that you need to keep in mind for yourself too, eventually your husband will deploy to Afghanistan and if he is any sort of a Marine he wants to. Wives and babies just have to deal with it. Marines really shouldn't be married in the first place, families are just a distraction from the mission.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Sucks don't it<br>  .<br>  And you two are not the first this has happen to either<br>  .<br>  On last weeks TV news at 6<br>  .<br>  There is a man and wife that she had a child while he was in the Middle East <br>  .<br>  And all he got to see of he new born child is what a web cam showed<br>  .|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Are you kidding me?  That is the biggest load of crap.<br>  <br>  I saw guys finalize a divorce while they were deployed during my last deployment to Al Asad.  Please, if one has orders, they are going.  The military does not care about your spousal problems.  Trust me.  They wife has no influence on him leaving or staying.|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Ugh, another whiney military wife...not you of course I'm talking about the wife you are referring to.<br>  <br>  One of the guys in my company had a wife who threatened divorce. The best he could manage (and this is probably the BEST case scenario) was get to his duty station, then apply for emergency leave. He was denied initially since he had just gotten there but was eventually given his emergency leave to go home and take care of whatever business he had with wifey. They eventually divorced, though.<br>  <br>  So, no, threatening divorce will not get him out of deployment. Won't even get him emergency leave, at least not right away.|`|32dbc6294cfba20a9ec0c35094c418a3aa	i don't think it's true last year in october we were supposed to have a wedding and they sent my husband away  in september so we got married through the court his Gunny did not care about our wedding he sent him anyway.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	First of all, I have never heard of being able to take someone else's place for a deployment. If it were possible, the military does not care what his wife does. That is a personal problem.|`|tcA1w24jaa	No....just no.<br>  <br>  A person's relationship has little to nothing to do with their deployment schedule. Both people knew the possability of deployment existed before they were married and/or in the military, so it's not like they can get upset when it actually happens. <br>  <br>  For exceptionally serious situations (A wife threatening divorce is not exceptionally serious, neither is the birth of a child, I know many, many Marines who have had both divorces and births while they weren't home) there are certain options, but generally, people just need to stop being such drama queens about everything.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know for sure, someone threatening divorce has absolutely no bearing on someone's deployment.<br>  <br>  That's what Marines do, we deploy, we fight, and we win wars. If she can't understand that, that's not the Marines problem, that's hers.|`|0dJMn9nTaa	truth is once you signed that contract the marine corp can send you out whenever they like, divorce isent a family emergency like death for example. so he will be deployed regardles if hes with her or not.|`|mroesp8Kaa	If that worked...then i guarantee you at least 98% of the guys wouldn't go over there.Not because their wives always threaten to leave them...but because thats all they would have to say to stay|`|cgbNGef5aa	You need to go to the Marines support group websites not here.  Obviously there are a lot of opinionated people here who don't care.<br>  <br>  I will list the support link in the source box below.  Also, there are tons of support groups for military wives and this is not the place to get real answers or support.  Regardless if he is deployed or not you should get to know real women who understand what you are going through.  <br>  <br>  I also listed sites to my sons story below.  He is a new Marine and I am hoping to get these sites out there to help others who are considering joining and what to expect.  Please visit, forward, bookmark and share them.  Thank you.<br>  God Bless<br>  Sandy

You may ask the parents to see if they know the information you seek.<br>  <br>  Also, there are special laws in regards to debt due to medical services.

wPBfydYhaa	Yes i do admit hitler was grand man, if you want to attach morality to the word grand that yours business. He did take away Germany from an abyss of depression and poverty changing it into a world power in just less than 10 years, i have to say that it quite a feat(i am no neo nazi and i sympathize among others over the horror of the Holocaust). But Hitler had flaws and over ambition led to germany being virtually destroyed in the wars end. Fortunately the germans were able to stand once again as a proud people and rebuilt its nation to the respectable one we know today. Germans are very sensitive over their brief history during its nazi regime. Anything associated to Nazis other than historical value is banned in germany. You can get arrested if you wore a swastika there. Hitler is seen very notorious in Germany just as most of the west sees him. Germany does feel very embarrassed and sorry over the man and events that led after to him becoming dictator. Was it not months ago in the news where a german museum hosted a wax figure of hitler only to have its head removed by a german man only after hours after the exhibit was open. You can see most Germans also have a distaste over hitler.|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	I don't know what Germans think, but make no mistake, Hitler was a great leader.  Look at everything he managed to do.  A "leader" doesn't necessarily mean making the right decisions or moral decisions.  Hitler could get people motivated to follow him and did it to perfection.  Clearly he must have been a great leader. Mostly I'm speaking of his earlier days before he was a dictator. He had to get himself up to that point.<br>  <br>  Obviously, he was a horrible person.  He took the country in all the wrong directions and had little value for human life, but he must have been an exceptional leader to be able to get so  many people to follow him (at least initially when it was still a choice).|`|NsbGM74iaa	He got them out of an economic depression by looting all the rich jews and then killing them.

SjTAVdcKaa	I worked for a state SO registry. It keeps track of the offenders; where they are, what they're doing & it's their responsibility to keep in contact. Like being on parole.<br>  & many states now have online registries of ALL court cases.

Privacy considerations, maybe?|`|G2auAv1Saa	It just let neighbors be aware of their past convictions and avoid their children from socializing with them. <br>  I also think the list should be expanded to anyone with a previous felony conviction.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	I would like to see the list expanded, too.  I would be very interested in knowing how many of neighbors have been convicted of home burglaries, car theft, etc....|`|wgOzHizAaa	The truth is that the entire sex offender registry needs to be overhauled. While I agree that repeat offenders, especially the violent ones, should be on a list, the other people should not. At least half of the people listed on the sex offender are not going to be repeat offenders. People need to realize that you can be added to the sex offender list for urinating in public, mooning, streaking, skinny dipping and other stupid things that should NOT brand you for life. <br>  <br>  With the outrageous laws that have been passed and those that are trying to be passed the only thing the sex offender registry does right now is ensue paranoia and persecution. <br>  <br>  And putting other criminals on a list is just ludicrous. They go to jail and serve their time. Next people will want to tattoo peoples crimes on their foreheads, or maybe just skip the justice system all together and go back to burning people at the stake.
AA12349988	In some ways yes it was more conservative.<br>  <br>  There where two lots of riots in the 1980's<br>  <br>  1,  The coal minor strike - the union at the time tried to break the right wing government by going on strike.  The Nottingham coal fields broke away from the union and continued to work which, along with imported coal kept the country going.  The striking union lost and the minors went back to work.  The unions where broken and 6 years later there was a round of mine closures including most of those that stayed open.  I grew up in one of the mining communities and still have family there - neighbours dont talk to each other even now if they where on opposing sides.<br>  <br>  2.  The poll tax riots - traditionally local taxes had always been raised on the rateable value of a house.  This changed to an individual person tax.  In some cases one person was living in a huge house paying 6 or 7 times as much as a family in a smaller house.   What happened in reality though was that it was an excuse to put taxes up and penalise everyone the same.   In some cases it was quite sever the tax burden per household went from say ￡250 per house to over ￡300 per person - if you had Mum, Dad and three over 18 children living there it was ￡1,500 a year.  Everyone over the age of 18 had to pay unless they was a student - so the lowest paid where paying a massive part of the wages in tax.  People refused to pay the tax and where imprisoned and there was also several violent riots.<br>  <br>  Eventually the poll tax riots went on until they where abolished and replaced with another system - but many people had criminal records and the Prime Minister of the time lost her job following a vote of no confidence.<br>  <br>  That is just a brief outline - both sets of events lasted more than a year each.|`|AA11450062	Yes with Thatcherism|`|m3ThrbDMaa	That's because Ronald Reagan and the senior Bush were republican presidents in charge for most of the 80's...Democrats are the "liberals" (we're the sensible ones, us Democrats) but...<br>  <br>  Motley Crue and Guns n Roses also came to power in the 80's, so...<br>  <br>  It you know anything about THOSE guys, you know it couldn't have been THAT conservative...

KKH9y0ECaa	Home Secretary Jacqui Smith recently declared that local Chief Constables have the right to restrict or set their own standards for public photography.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=836675" rel="nofollow">http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPag...</a><br>  <br>  Smith announced the news in a letter to the National Union of Journalists, which had raised issue with the Home Secretary after it was determined that police were photographing and keeping a file on photographers and journalists documenting protests.<br>  <br>  The Home Secretary response starts with, “first of all, may I take this opportunity to state that the government greatly values the importance of the freedom of the press, and as such there is no legal restriction on photography in a public places”. <br>  <br>  Then comes the but, “however, decisions may be made locally to restrict or monitor photography in reasonable circumstances. That it is an operational decision for the officers involved based on the individual circumstances of each situation”.  The British Journal of Photography view on this is that this “green lights restrictions on photography” and the Press Gazette view is that the Home Secretary is telling us that the surveillance of journalists by the police is an “operational decision”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://marcvallee.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/jacqui-smith-replies-on-police-surveillance-of-journalists-well-kind-of/" rel="nofollow">http://marcvallee.wordpress.com/2008/07/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The Government has also recently passed the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, which become law on February 16, 2009.<br>  <br>  Whereas in the past the police have not had the power to prevent photographs being taken of them, from now on they have. Under the new Counter-Terrorism Act it is an offence to take pictures of officers "likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism". <br>  <br>  This is such a catch-all measure that it can be used – and, in view of recent trends, will be used – to prevent photographs to which the police object merely by invoking counter-terrorist requirements.

You can wear almost whatever you want (contacts, conservative civillian frames) when you get back to your Guard unit.<br>  <br>  Make sure your prescription is up to date before you leave for Basic, and bring a set of glasses with your current prescription.  Do not bring contacts.  You will get issued two sets of BCGs in Basic training.  Not to worry, though - everyone with bad eyesight will get BCGs too.  No one will care.  You may also get a set of civilian style glasses issued to you.  This is a fairly recent change to Basic Training, but it will be up to your Drill Sergeants when (and if) you can wear them.  Really, it's better to wear the BCGs in the field - the last thing you want is for your glasses to break.<br>  <br>  At the PX at your Reception Battalion, make sure you purchase at least 2-3 pair of eye glass retaining straps.  These will keep your glasses from falling off while you're training.  You can also purchase a defogger spray.  However, the best thing to prevent your glasses from fogging up is soap.  Coat your glasses in soap, then rub the soap off until you can see clearly.  It will last longer than the spray, and it's not as "gross" as spit (though spit will work if you're in a pinch).  The glasses will be uncomfortable at first, and you might get some small sores on your nose and ears, but these will go away after a week or two.  <br>  <br>  When you get back to your unit, be careful about wearing contacts in the field - use common sense.|`|tcA1w24jaa	You're trying to tell us you want to serve your country...but all you can find to talk about is what your glasses will make you look like in boot camp?<br>  <br>  Sugar, no one gives a zark what anyone else in boot camp looks like unless it comes down to squaring away uniforms.<br>  <br>  Get over it.|`|ILgk3OLOaa	Yes, you'll have to wear them in basic.  No ones going to care what you look like there, get over it.|`|1eb29e16166794203a3fa52b5c9b51b8aa	you wear  army issued  glasses  n  clothes|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Once you get started in training the glasses will be the least of your worries.<br>  <br>  I never wore the glasses...And I wear glasses to read. I was able to see good enough not to wear them. They issued me a pair and I put them away. I don't like any glasses. I still don't wear them unless they are reading glasses.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bother with contacts. they are a big hassle and if you get dirt or what ever in your eye during training you can't just take them out. <br>  <br>  After basic training you can wear any glasses as long as the frames are modest. I mean you can't wear faddish glasses...like Elton John.|`|hwbtEVFHaa	Are you enlisting to serve your country, or look for a boyfriend? You need to grow up and get over it. If the biggest concern is wearing glasses,  you will have an extremely difficult time while in boot. If you concern about glasses sliding off, then get the strap for them. Once you are done with boot, you can wear whatever it is that makes you look pretty again, Paris!!!|`|cDnxIXjvaa	You have to wear them, and under no circumstances can you use contacts. After basic, you can where your civilian glasses as long as they conform to AF 670-1 1-15a (and b).|`|0dJMn9nTaa	honestly no one cares what you look like in bootcamp keep in mind your all the same in there. you will all do the same exercises and get dirty the same exact way. you will be fine.|`|mroesp8Kaa	A little advice...if you are really *that* worried about your appearance...you should rethink the military. Besides....as others have said...once you get to basic...glasses will be the least of your worries.|`|mu6NZnzIaa	Well first off yes you will have to wear the BCG's. You can not and you wont want to wear contacts in the field you can damage your eyes. Theres only one size shape and color for the BCG's. The answer to your second question is you will have to report to your unit within i believe 3 days thats what i had to do. You can either call them or go there your self. I was only in the reserves a year but we did our 2 week AT during the summer in ft irwin cali. Wearing glasses doesnt matter when it comes to training. When you get to your unit you can wear civi glasses but if your unit deploys and your unit knows you wear glasses they wont let you wear contacts due to safety problems.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	In basic you are only going to regularly be seen by women who are going through the same stuff as you are and your instructors.  BCGs are quite comfortable and easy to take care of.  After completion of basic you are allowed to wear modest conservative framed glasses of your choice.  You simply will not have time to properly and safely wear contact lenses in basic.  Depending on your occupational field you will probably be allowed to wear contacts;  In some fields contacts are now being issued (at least in the Navy).<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course if you were a guy you could join the Submarine Service and be issued "Radar O'Reilly" glasses.

Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden. <br>  <br>  Economic growth:<br>  <br>  U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000. <br>  The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year). <br>  President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton. <br>  This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.<br>  The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.<br>  Household consumption:<br>  <br>  The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005. <br>  The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742).

He was the Republican nominee for president in the 2008 United States election.<br>  <br>  McCain followed his father and grandfather, both four-star admirals, into the United States Navy, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958. He became a naval aviator, flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers. During the Vietnam War, he nearly lost his life in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire. In October 1967, while on a bombing mission over Hanoi, he was shot down, badly injured, and captured by the North Vietnamese. He was a prisoner of war until 1973. McCain experienced episodes of torture, and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer. His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations.<br>  <br>  He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981, moved to Arizona, and entered politics. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, he served two terms, and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, winning re-election easily in 1992, 1998, and 2004. While generally adhering to conservative principles, McCain at times has had a media reputation as a "maverick" for having disagreed with his party. After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns, which eventually led to the passage of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s, and for his belief that the war in Iraq should be fought to a successful conclusion. McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee, has opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel, and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.<br>  <br>  McCain ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but lost a heated primary contest to George W. Bush. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but lost to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election.|`|WnDr1rFoaa	he's the guy who warned the democrats 3 years ago that something was fishy and needed looked at in the banking and finance business. you know, the one barny frank/chris dodd says were just fine. oh yeah...he's an Arizona Senator who ran for prez in this last election|`|PfCga0X5aa	He is “Old School Republican” sitting in the corner with a load in his Depends pandering to anyone that will vote for him – he lost the last election on his “wisdom”|`|HYFQpkylaa	I think he is the guy who gave the U.K oven chips !|`|5YTkGB5yaa	He's a Senator from Arizona who ran in the 2008 Presidential Election for the Republicans.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	He ran against Obama, and is considered by many the head of his party, not to be confused with the head of the Republican Committee.|`|xUQDTEbZaa	He's a womanizer from Arizona|`|zhk8o514aa	That is some darrrk cave you've been living in.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Let me guess<br>  <br>  you voted for Obama|`|NnUAXyCGaa	He is a real hero, and not a zero like Obama|`|qjH3Tigbaa	He was the loser of the 2008 Elections by a small margain.

uh2bkRrFaa	Interesting case. He didn't have his headlights on. Might actually be a rare fightable offense. 99% of the violations I see in here the person has no case but you might actually have a good one. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, remember, if you fight a case and lose you cannot go to traffic school to get it off your record, so keep that in mind. If you lose it will be on your record and your insurance WILL go up. But your case might be something worth going to court for.

I do believe it's your right of way but I'm not totally sure.

The green turn signal usually means a "protected" turn - protected from all oncoming traffic.  As far as points are concerned; check you Maryland rules.

yuBuNoPDaa	Yes because they are irresponsible and some tough action is required. These aren't necessarily kids with mental or physical problems. It's parents that are neglecting them or not in tune with what kids need. They can't bother to educate themselves or do things differently. The kids suffer. They have a much harder life - can get into more serious trouble - can be a burden on society. The parents get off. That's wrong. You bring into the world - it's your responsibility to take the first step - do right by your kids. No excuses. Reach out for help.|`|d3d94b7461a0d0776423a6eeaa2b2d01aa	Not all people see eye to eye when it comes to discipline.  CPS on them and say their kid is neglected.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	It really depends. Some kids are very out there. Parents may not be able to control them. <br>  <br>  It is very unfair to put a one size fits all type of punishment. These are cases that have to be reviewed.<br>  <br>  Of course, in some cases the parents could care less. <br>  <br>  Taking action against the parents can bring some extra problems. What actions would you suggest? Putting a parent in jail? Have him lose his or her job? <br>  <br>  Should a gang-banger's action make a parent go to jail or force him to use discipline when it can cost the parent his or her life?<br>  <br>  In any case, I don't think parents should be judged so much but the attention should go to the kid and how to help him or her with the behavior problem.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Fingerprints are not a function of DNA, but rather random chemical processes.<br>  <br>  And it's a classic legal theory about conjoined twins and one who commits murder.

You can get with the rear-detachment for more info but they might not even know yet.

Gave me about 24 hours to prepare lol.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Is this just an R&R or an actual homecoming?<br>  <br>  If it is R&R, you have to rely on your husband's information.

af8c31673b27aed06fb07d7641b9b88eaa	Joining the military to get money for college is good, but you must remember, the primary responsibility of all in the services is to protect our country.  As for which service, I'm partial to the Navy.  I served and my son enlisted last summer.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	If you want the maximum amount of money you can join the Army.  They offer about $81,000 if you qualify for the Army College fund, enlist for six years, and combine it with the GI Bill.  If six years is too much time you can get $71,000 if you enlist for four.  If you don't qualify for the Army College Fund (only certain jobs offer it) then you can still get $47,500 from the GI Bill by itself for doing three years or more and that amount will go up automatically with the new GI Bill coming this fall.<br>  <br>  Also, you can take classes while on active duty with Tuition Assistance, which is $4,500 a year paid directly to the school.  The only catches to the TA is that it doesn't pay for books (but some schools are including the cost of books with tuition which will effectively pay for the books) and if you fail the class you was taking you have to pay back the cost of that class and it automatically comes out of your pay.<br>  <br>  You can get with a recruiter for more information.  But above all remember that you will have to serve and you might get deployed somewhere during your time in service.|`|ea6fcaed3a536ba7f017e71d99957ab0aa	The Marines<br>  <br>  <br>  SEMPER FI|`|v6KSGrlJaa	Air Force|`|jGAX8sSlaa	If your only goal is to get college money i would join the National Guard.

sHHfDscgaa	I agree.  But I really don't think they should take the kids away from her unless they are being neglected or they feel the kids are in danger.  I think she is taking the donations and using them very selfishly.  I mean, I just have one child and any extra money that I get, I pay bills with it or get diapers.  Getting manicures with any extra money she has in my opinion shows neglect.  I mean, she has one child with autism, and two other children with other problems.  <br>  <br>  No one person can handle that responsibility alone.  I don't care who you are.  That's not including hiring nannies or anything like the celebrities do.  It's hard to show unconditional love to 14 kids with just one parents.  <br>  <br>  If people want to help out, a bank should secure an account for all 14 children.  Before the funds are released, the mother has to give the bank an account of what she's spending it on and bring a reciept showing that the funds were spent on the children.  Seems a little harsh, but people are giving their hard earned money to help out her cause.  She should be gratefully for the money and accept the accountability.|`|1j7QLM7Saa	this is an opinionated answer and has no point of being on this website, way to waste bandwith.|`|AA11206283	She should be subject to the same laws and conditions that every other mother is.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	kaiser permanente oughta be liable for food,housing,medical care,etc,,,,,,,till they're all 21,i'll voulunteer ta babysit
AA11963685	One thing I have learned is that when a Republican President calls for a bailout there is nothing but the sound of crickets on the subject of socialism and a hail of "yays" from members of his party, but when a Democratic President calls for a bailout then Republicans scream socialism until their throats rupture.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  You are the exception then, at least in this forum.  I'm glad you aren't the typical conservative where this is concerned.<br>  <br>  And since that is the case, I'll stop being a smart azz and answer the question asked.  What I have learned, and most of this is from studying history, that sometimes the economy becomes so shaky, so unsupportable and unfixable by any actions coming from the private sector, that we have to give the "fix" over to the government, in a socialist manner, until the economy improves.  Since we have done this before, and managed to still remain a solidly capitalistic nation, I'm not overly concerned that we're about to become a nation of socialists.  Also, it seems to me that most of this problem stemmed from almost a complete lack of oversight and regulation in the private sector.  If the private sector won't regulate itself in a responsible manner, then where do we go from there to right this problem.  <br>  <br>  I don't pretend to be an economist.   I'm just trying to understand all of this like most people I know.  Perhaps I am being too complacent about the dangers of socialism but I'm not convinced by the hysteria over this that the right has been displaying.  Most of the time it seems to be more of a reaction against Obama himself than what we are doing to right the economy.|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	hmmm...define socialism for me please. seems like everyone has a different definition these days.<br>  <br>  government bailouts?

He didn't even know his own opinions or positions unless the questions were scripted and he was briefed beforehand and given a stack of 3x5 cards.

Obama at least can answer hostile questions, and can discuss and defend his ideas.  <br>  <br>  But yes, his big contributors are pulling the strings.

Re9Pdfxbaa	I find it refreshing for a black man to ask this question and the comments you make. I served for 34 years in the prison service and yes some black prisoners would call me racist if i said NO to them, they would say "its because i am black" these were in the minority. Most black prisoners were brilliant and respectful i had a serious incident involving four black prisoners threatening one of my officers calling him a racist, which he was not. so i called a meeting of ten black prisoners and asked them if there was a race issue, all of them said "NO they were four bad people and do not represent us in fact they undermine a genuine race complaint"<br>  I have had Irish prisoners say "its because i am Irish" and Travellers say "its because i am a traveller" so it is across the board white and black. But the majority are amiable and why not.|`|44AkhdRnaa	The issue is that it can be used so often and with some good results for the person playing the race card.<br>  <br>  If they could 'white' chavs would do the same. It's an easy option.|`|LzN2Uv8Gaa	It is easier to scream racist than it is to admit that you are a walking pile of poo.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	If you have a trump card that always worx, you use it.|`|BpXdkLTBaa	I think that it has to do with the feeling of being threatened. I only say this due to the fact that I am in a inter-racial relationship and have been with my fiance for over 3 years. There are many black females that try to hit on him and when he tells them that he is married, and they see me, they always have something derogatory to say. So in saying what you did, I would say that the black men that you are referencing, would also feel threatened, not to mention they do not want to or fear taking responsibility for their actions. It may lead to further feelings of incompetence. I am sure that it is easier to live each day with the idea that "you have got to get yours by any means necessary" or what ever , then to put on some decent clothes and try to work for less than what they would make off of stolen property or other illegal activities. Just my opinion though....|`|sA7DuUUBaa	the reason is that its because they want to try to use any accuse in the book to manipulate the situation to get out of what they did wrong and also try to get free money from a law suit. this way they get there drugs and still get paid if the police bust them... so they try anyways yes this sickens me also. regardless of anyone race if you break the law then don't complain about being caught....|`|2d7163e6fbb32121be39f1602d1e4abcaa	I actually think that statement belongs to Folklore. I was a Police officer for 30 years and very few Black men ever said that. I actually enjoyed dealing with them because on the whole I found them to be quite fair minded and prepared to "take the hit" when they were caught, that was more than could be said about certain other nationalities.|`|vOOdwjMzaa	I wouldnt say all black men do that lol but i understand what youre saying. i work in a prison as an officer and ive noticed that most criminals always feel like theyre being singled out or treated unfairly, even when theyre caught red handed. And if youre an officer of a different race than the criminal they like to say youre being racist.i dont know what makes them act that way and why they cant just own up to the mistakes they made. I guess its just an easy out for them. and i agree that most dont know anything about true racism, if they want to know about racism they should talk to people who grew up in the 60's and see how things were then.|`|MnTvROkmaa	"the only people offended by bigotry are the bigots themselves"|`|DZm8Ubciaa	Something tells me that you are not black!

America chose - even if I didn't like the outcome.  I really hoped for the best, but his actions, so quickly, are scaring me. <br>  <br>  I think he is way too inexperienced to be president.  He has an arrogant, one-track mind, and refuses to listen to or contemplate any other viewpoint than his own.  <br>  <br>  He bullied the stimulus bill into passage, and refused to listen to honest complaints about the junk that was stuck in there.  If the stimulus package was so important, take the junk out.<br>  <br>  He is using the stimulus bill to ignore the constitution he swore to uphold by bribing states with money to ignore his overstepping.<br>  <br>  He is dividing this country instead of bringing it together.  <br>  <br>  His negative attitude sucks.|`|E6EbbZXzaa	I have nothing against  him personally, and I think he's done very well for himself. I think he's a Marxist and he's going to bring us down the same path as Soviet Russia.<br>  <br>   I don't care what race he is. <br>  <br>  I think he's already ignored our constitution once by appointing Hillary Clinton to Secretary of the State when the constitution clearly states she can't hold it this term. I believe that he's going to do so again with programs such as media reform and ignore 1st amendment. <br>  <br>  I think he's a liar. He's lied about abiding by public funding in campaigning by not accepting it or abiding by it's rules which he said he would. <br>  <br>  I think he promised the public could see bills for 5 days before the stimulus and he lied about that.<br>  <br>  I appreciate that he's continuing the Bush policy on the war on terror, but he lied about how he'd handle that too. <br>  <br>  So, overall, I'm not a fan but when he does things right I'll support him.

ZNe6B9TQaa	He was appointed it through the U.S. Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore.  Irregardless of any votes, the end result was due to the SCOTUS ruling.<br>  <br>  I think it's more the other way around, that there was a discrepancy because he was already rather out of favor at that point.

The case boiled down to recounting in Florida.  Ultimately, independent recounts showed that Bush would have won Florida anyway.  So, after the fact, the actions of the Supreme Court weren't relevant.<br>   <br>  The only way to believe differently would be to think that if the Supreme Court would have ruled differently, then the outcome of the counts would have changed.  <br>  <br>  As far as whether that influenced any particular person's feelings, I rather doubt it.

433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	We have lived on post for the majority of our military time.  One thing to think of is that military posts are the ulitmate gated community...in general, without an ID or a military member to escort you, civilians aren't allowed.  On most bases, kids still ride thier bikes all over, play at playgrounds and walk to and from the bus stop without worries.  While not crime free, there are much lower instances of crime against strangers and random attacks.  Everyone near you is living the same life you are...the other kids have moved just as often, have been the new kid before and for the most part, accept new friends pretty quickly.  Bases have their own children's sports teams, a rec center, many have a pool and golf course, day care centers, youth centers, bowling alleys,librarys and movie theatres.  Of course, your kids will most likely go to school off base (unless overseas, most US bases no longer have DoDDs schools), you can go to the mall, shop at whatever stores you like.  We did eventually move off base...to get into a better public school district...but I miss the convenience and safety we had on base...as well as the fact that if anything went wrong with the appliances, heating/ac or other parts of the house, base housing took care of it and there was no cost!|`|mroesp8Kaa	Base is just like a regular neighborhood really...except you need id's to get into your neighborhood. Its not like your stuck on base,and i do believe most posts no longer have schools,so they go to school off post anyway. Not to mention, you won't necessarily get post housing anyways...its all a matter of where you're stationed,and their housing availability.Not to mention,you will probably move around to other posts at some point in his career...so it can vary from one place to the next|`|s5lj3ENhaa	My kids are growing up like any other kids....we live on post they go to school and the playground.....just because we live on post doesn't mean we do everything there we still take them to the mall and chucky cheeses.....my children's upbringing is the same as any other child that has a parent in the military whether they live on post or off they all go through the same things. Where you live doesn't change that|`|AA12174100	like the others have said, its the same as living in any other neighborhood. But not all military housing is actually on a base. Some is just a certain area of housing for military. My husband was in for 20 years and we enjoyed it. Your neighbors understand what you go thru day to day.
kijIJbBxaa	It's because everyone has been dumbed down through our controlled education system and the general mass media. Most people are not cognizant of the dark agenda of the Illuminati or the N.W.O. It takes people with very high intelligence and keen senses to break free of the hypnosis the Illuminati has most of us under. If you had told me that a satanic cult had nearly complete control of our world a few years ago, I would have thought you had lost your last marble. But after extensive research on the matter, there can be no other explanation for what is occurring. Further, I work in the marketing field and part of my job is to do a lot of research (often on government websites). From my observations, most govt. sponsored websites contain large amounts of occult and satanic imagery. I've noticed that the occult logos and images are probably the worst on school web pages. They have stuff like the sun symbol of Baal, triple 6's cleverly disguised, etc. It really blows me away after awhile. It is so blatant - they barely hide it! We also hear our world leaders openly talk about the N.W.O and most people are not even awake to care about it. <br>  <br>  9/11 was a false flag operation orchestrated by the evil ones who are doing all this sh*t to our world.|`|VSmQWuhEaa	People are sheep, who choose to ignore the threat of meglomanic ambition, sticking their head in the sand while sitting in their easy chair with beer, rather than educate themselves, and become active. For the latter takes effort and risk.

She still believes in creationism and that abstinence only will work, even though she has clear evidence in her own family that proves it doesn't.

The good people of that state "hired" her and seem to like her overall and that's their business. <br>  As for her being presidential, a majority of US voters made it clear they do not think she was ready to be a heart-beat away from the Oval Office.  She made too many gaffes in the few interviews she gave and I think that her vision of the vice presidency was too much like Dick Cheney's, which most people were never comfortable with.  She is currently too polarizing a figure to be successful on the national stage, but she obviously has a future role to play.

The question itself is as pointless to them as is the expendable asset itself.  The powerful have no problem with losing human assets in the quest of attaining long term imperial goals and huge profits as long as the assets being expended are someone else's flesh and blood.  How else to explain the lack of commitment in supplying their own family members to the pool of cannon fodder?  If spreading democracy and freedom are such highly prized values then why are so few of the nation's wealthy in the battlefield?  Why are so few rich people or Congress member's children in uniform?  The answer is obvious.  Rich people and the ruling elite are significant.  Everyone else is not.  The rich know the score and are not about to digress into systemic insignificance through becoming casualties in wars relegated to be fought by someone else. Their destiny is to rule.  The destiny of everyone else is to serve them, even die for them, so they can continue to rule.<br>  <br>  The wealthy, by virtue of their wealth, separate themselves from those not as privileged as they.  They then project and profess that separateness onto the separated.  To them the struggling masses are alien.  The reality of the rich is unlike the day-to-day experience of the six-billion working class people of planet earth.  The definition of what is alien is, however, backwards and is a common misperception exacerbated  through the manipulation of media owned by the wealthy.  What we perceive through the plug-in-drug (television) is what the manipulators want us to perceive.  The boob tube's programming is designed to instill what we are to believe, think, and how we are to behave.  Thus, a fetus has more rights than a child born into poverty.  Bombing pregnant darker-skinned women, killing both the mother and fetus, is acceptable collateral damage while reproductive rights are branded as murder.  Tell us what to  fear and we will fear it.  Tell us what to hate and we will hate it.  Tell us who to blame and we will blame them.  Tell us who to kill and we will kill them.  Tell us what to die for and we will die for it.  Tell us what matters and we will make it important.  Tell us we are insignificant and we make ourselves insignificant.  But never tell us that we are ignorant pawns in the game that profits those that do the telling.  Never tell us that our lives and the lives of loved ones don't mean squat in the imperialist's drive for global hegemony|`|kJM65nXJaa	There is no dishonor in it either. I hope you live a long enough life to figure it out.|`|HcFHLGIaaa	I agree that many who stay poor well into their later lives don't see their own input into their situation.  Part of it is breaking the cycle so their children don't imitate them and helping people to see what pitfalls there are in life that will keep them poor.<br>  <br>  But no, the worst thing you can do is 'take care' of someone who is poor.  Help them find their feet...that's the job.<br>  <br>  Honor in being rich?  I have a half-sister who came from the same ragged house I was born in who has worked her butt off for 50 years to be where she is today---wealthy.  So yes, I have tremendous admiration for her.  Same as I do for the rest of my family who have done well in their lives.<br>  <br>  Honestly, in my life, most of those who have 'money' and are 'rich' to the average eye have earned it....I know few silver spooners.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Once upon a time it was a GOOD THING if you went to school, studied hard, said no to drugs, didn't get anybody pregnant, graduated high school, went on to college with a scholarship or student loan, studied hard, stayed focussed, avoided temptation, graduated with a degree, got a good job, worked hard, got a promotion, and went on to make six figures as a reward for being responsible.  <br>  <br>  But not today........<br>  <br>  Today if you make six figures in this country then you MUST have scrooged somebody over to get where you are, you probably had rich parents who paid your way through a 4-year college that you probably didn't deserve to go to, and you probably got the job you have because your daddy plays golf with the CEO of the company.  NO WAY you did it on your own through hard work, commitment, and making the right choices!|`|gSdeVUOTaa	I too grew up in Michigan. I grew up well. Though it didn't secure me a place in this world.

I am constantly reminding my kids where we came from so that they do not repeat history.  I took NO government aid because I felt it would be defeating and perhaps make me complacent...also, I had integrity.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that being poor is honorable...but also, I feel that if you ARE poor, that you not go out and buy the latest cell phone, have loads of kids, go on Maury or Jerry, etc.|`|KF48OjyDaa	I don't think there is honor in being poor. I think there is honor in helping those less fortunate than you. All of us make bad decisions in our lives. Regardless of whether they have made perfect choices in their lives, I don't believe in just giving up on human beings.|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	There is honor in being a person, regardless of wealth.  <br>  <br>  I could ask the opposite of you, why do think there is honor in being rich?|`|204577ae32c80edc66057923f993dd9aaa	Actually, I see far more people like you and worse who treat the poor as the last group it is acceptable to discriminate against and acceptable to insult, and there is no organization that's going to get up in anyone's face because they did it.  In fact, I don't know of anyone who tells the poor there is "honor" in being poor, only that one has the right to a fundamental sense of personal pride and self-respect regardless of being poor.  Without that, one is highly unlikely to be able to rise from poverty because one will be assured that one has all one deserves.  The self-loathing then becomes a tendency to hurt oneself (drugs/alcohol/self-mutilation) or others (crime of various stripes).<br>  <br>  I'm glad to hear that you were able to change your fortune so greatly.   That's what I want for every poor person in this country.  But you make a dreadful mistake when you think that because you took a shower, cut your hair, bought a suit and moved out of an economically depressed city and your luck changed (and don't put "luck" in quotes because it makes an arrogant assumption that isn't logically accurate that because something happened X way for you it will happen X way for everyone) that you can speak to every person's poverty as being in their hands to eliminate.<br>  <br>  Not everyone has the same circumstances.  Not everyone has only themselves to consider like you obviously did.  In my experience, when you're poor, you have a very small window of opportunity in which to make the "right choices" and if you make just one of them wrong, it becomes a determining factor for possibly the rest of your life.  The difference between the rich and the poor is not necessarily "quality of choices," though that's part of it.  It's that when rich people, or even middle class people, make mistakes, they have family, friends and savings to bail them out and give them the chance to make a different choice -- set a different course.  The poor don't have that cushion.  When those of means, whether some means or abundant means, make mistakes, we tell them, "Okay, so you made a mistake, learn from it and move on."  We ask them, "Okay, so what's next for you?"  With the poor and working class, that mistake may very well have represented the one and only chance they will ever get at moving up the ladder.  So not to say that anyone should ever give up or resign themselves to "I'm just not lucky; this is my life so I may as well get used to it; or, I'm living like this because X and Y did this to me," but to say that it is entirely in the individual's hands to change whenever they want to is a uniquely American delusion influenced by an overdose of ego, too much testosterone and some well-targeted marketing.|`|VDgAJETtaa	Sounds like any answer outside of " hate everybody that didn't do what I did" will be the wrong answer.  You story is a sad one, but remember there are others that had it worse off than you.  Throw some racism, sexism, and ageism in the mix, and you will see why there are so many poor people ot there. I think can both agree that there are a ton of able body people out there that just don't want to work.  But there are more people that do.

And I do not believe that the poor should be honored.  If they have truly tried to make a go of things, and can't seem to get their footing, that is another story.  However, the majority, yes, I say the majority, just sit back and let everyone else pay their way.  I am adamant about this.....you have to at least try to get out of that awful way of life.  I don't believe most do.  Again, good for you.  I wish there were more with stories such as yours.

There's no correlation between honor and wealth.<br>  <br>  It is a myth that all poor people are poor by choice.  Some, I will grant you.  All?  No.  Majority?  No.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Most people in this country don't know what being really poor is.<br>  <br>  Go to central Mexico and look at the people living in shacks made out of scrap lumber & card board.

But overall the way we deal with the poor, vs the way we should really doesn't address this and often its too late.<br>  <br>  You mention decision making and that is certainly a major part of the problem. But overall behavior and environment is a huge factor in people remaining poor. If I was to write a welfare reform, its major platform would be to address these issues, because that is what it takes to get these people out of their situations.|`|AA11312653	Statistics do not support your view. If we leave out entertainers, athletes, lottery winners, and those who receive large legal settlements then we can get a realistic idea of how much financial upward mobility there is in our society. Overwhelmingly, people are at near the same income level as the rest of the family they were born into. A few move up or down a few rungs on the income ladder, but the number born into dire poverty who rise to even the level of financial security is so small as to be statistically zero. Unless we believe that laziness and foolishness are geneitc traits, then it is beyond belief that Americans born to poor families are poor solely due to laziness and foolishness. <br>  <br>  It takes more than work ethic, it takes opportunity and good luck and the ability to take risks. A person whose worst case scenario is "I'd have to live in my parents basement and ride a my bicycle to a lousy job at a supermarket" is in a position to risk everything. Like any gamble, the more you can risk the more you can potentially gain. A person whose worst case scenario is "I will be sleeping in doorways and the state will take away my kids" is not in a position to take risks at all. To this person that low paying dead end "bird in the hand" job must be desperately clung to, and not risked to try to gain some higher paying "two in the bush" employment. <br>  <br>  It is a very corrupt idea to hold poor people in contempt for the accident of birth that has placed them in poverty. Yes, that homeless man who panhandles $20 a day spends most of it on wine. If I lived under a bridge than I'd probably want to get drunk every night too. Someday you may have a misfortune in your life and learn that we are not masters of our destiny but pawns of fate. Enjoy your state of being temporarily healthy and able bodied, temporarily doing well in your businesses. Your life could change dramatically.

So you might have a code of conduct in relation to purchasing (fair trade for eg), code of conduct in relation to corruption...<br>  <br>  A code of ethics is similar but can be more high level, more a statement of belief.

9VRwBeATaa	You get put through many tests before you can actually be considered for a job with the FBI. One of which will test your ability to keep cool during stressful situations.

Well...maybe not blood...<br>  <br>  But in short, I do lose my temper very quickly.  I hate people like that too--I read an autobiography about this woman in the FBI, who was a field agent, and single-handedly caught a pedophile and child rapist.  If I had single-handedly caught that idiot--*single*, alone, without back up, without witnesses--I would have done a Jack Bauer on him and gone balistic.<br>  <br>  I find that putting myself in normal situations help to control my impatience.  I think that tempers are related to patience, and if you can control your patience, you can control your temper.  Therefore, to help with my patience, I do normal activities such as fishing (which *really* tries my patience...honestly...idiot fish are never biting...), or going shooting with my grandfather and my dad and brother.  Shooting is especially fun, when we can just go into the back country and do some target practice...plus, I'm getting good firearm practice, and I'm spending time with family.<br>  <br>  Anyways, hope I helped in some way...I'm in a relatively calm mood right now, as you can tell.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Phoenix|`|ntef2sPMaa	I know that if you have bi polar, you cant be in the army. i would imagine it would be the same for the FBI if you do have bi polar. but if not and you just have a bad temper then I dont see why you couldnt be in the FBI.

Amazing isn't it?|`|CM1dfztQaa	It's absolutely shameful that someone could work like a dog and still not be able to support their family, while their are perfectly healthy people on welfare living well.<br>  <br>  Many of the people who are healthy, but too lazy to get off of their butts and work, live better than the rest of us. They are eating steak and sitting on nice furniture and watching cable on a brand new tv, while many of the working poor are eating ramen noodles and sitting on broken down sofas after a hard days work, wondering if the have enough money left over to pay the electric bill.<br>  <br>  Welfare was started toward the end of the Great Depression. It was only supposed to be a temporary fix to help those who were trying to get back on their feet. If someone is healthy, they should be forced to get a job after a few months of help. It's not meant to permanently support those who refuse to do nothing. Those people should have to live on the streets.<br>  <br>  Welfare helped my aunt after her divorce. She used it to care for her two children and help her get an education so she could get work. She's been off of assistance and taking care of her family on her own for 20 years now. She never went back to assistance, and she only used it for it's real purpose.|`|bVJSlo3Raa	I agree for some people you can work as hard as you like but lets face it life is a ***** and that is something the conservatives do not take into consideration due to the fact that it would mean they would have to pay more taxes to help these people who work their *** off but that isn't trying to make life a bit more fair you are evil and hate america if you want that to happen.|`|jjt2enntaa	there are millions of working poor.  Many work two jobs.  Make $10/hr at one job and $6/hr at another job.  pay rent, gas, electric, car insurance, car repairs, gasoline, groceries, clothes, dental bills, medical bills and/or medical insurance,  eye glasses, and your $480/week is gone.

Day care should be offered to the working poor at a nominal monthly fee ($5 or $10). Schools where children of the working poor should be heavily subsidized, because the environment of poverty causes depression and other mental health issues, which is a major factor in underachivement.<br>  The Welfare System should reward people who take the initiative to get a job. When the person on welfare has a job, their welfare payments should be lowered on a step-down basis, not cut altogether. If a job is putting less food on the table than a welfare check, the poor stay poor. <br>  People who work more than 60 hours a week, have a family, and can prove that they are under-eating should be offered low-cost housing.<br>  Troublemakers are not allowed to stay at a low-cost housing unit. It is strictly for law-abiding people. People who qualify for low-cost housing must attend a government seminar "Guide to Drinking Alcohol in Moderation" because, statistics show that alcoholism leads to instability among those who have the courage to find work.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	When I speak of "poor people' that's exactly who I refer to.....the working poor.

However the original use of the internet was to communicate in the event of a nuclear exchange. I would guess that there might be some limited sort of internet, nothing we would recognize though. The plan for nuclear war is basically hope someone survives...|`|AA10811674	It would most likely mean back to the Stone Age. Nikita Khrushchev said it best "The survivors will envy the dead".<br>  As far as survivalibity, the electromagnetic pulses from the explosions would probably wipe out all commercial electronics except those old vacuum tube radios. Nuclear winter would set in. It would mean another mass extinction. We might recover in a few thousand years or so.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Internet was designed to deal with a nuclear war!  In fact that was one of the reasons ARPANet (the Internet's predecessor) was designed.  The lines go throughout the country by several paths, so if one city is wiped out messages are automatically rerouted.  So if you are in NY and you're sending IMs to  Los Angeles and Chicago suddenly disappears, your IMs will automatically go through St. Louis and you won't know the difference.  Which is pretty great, so long as you don't live in Chicago.<br>  <br>  When I was  kid we were told the radiation from a nuclear blast lasts 2-3 weeks.  That was in the 1950s, when we used to do 'duck and cover' drills at school in case a nuclear blast went off outside the windows.  But more recent information shows that the radioactive dust a nuclear bomb kicks up into the atmosphere lasts a lot longer and covers a much bigger area.  Most of the people killed by the Hiroshima blast died over the next 20-30 years!  Chernobyl killed perhaps as many as 100,000 people throughout Europe.<br>  <br>  The US doesn't plan a nuclear war.  In fact I think by the 1970s all nuclear-armed countries realized they could never really use nukes, they only wanted them as a deterrent.  The US designed small 'battlefield' nukes but weren't even able to use those.  Every nuclear nation has signed a no first use agreement (except the US of course).  I don't think the leader of any nation could envision a scenario whereby he had anything to gain from the first use of nukes, because whoever uses them first becomes the villain of the world and every other country will gang up against him.<br>  <br>  I think terrorists might use nukes if they could get their hands on them, desperate people with nothing to lose. But even there, we could identify the source of the weapons by their radioactive 'signature', and that country would have a lot of explaining to do.<br>  <br>  I like the way Carl Sagan put it. The nuclear arms race is like two people in a room, up to their waists in gasoline, arguing over who has the most matches.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	A nuclear war today would almost certainly set up a chain that would annihilate us all.  The President may have some sort of top secret hiding place, but I doubt it.  The only think left would be the cockroaches.  The half life of radiation is ridiculous.  Think about Chernobyl.  They are still dying from that and they had to build a giant sarcophagus over the thing.  You would not live through this.

It's not very happy.|`|0dJMn9nTaa	well depending were the bomb hit, some areas of the country might still have full use of their phone,internet etc. but certainly the spot were the bomb hit and the states sorrounding it will not.<br>  <br>  radiation will last 10-15 years, but that also depends on how fast we can start cleaning up, with all this new technology it shouldent be to long like back in ww2

3PIrzCAuaa	From speaking to my elderly relative there was no everyday sense of 'pride'...every day seemed to bring death and damage and life seemed to revolve around the small events like taking in families who had been 'bombed out', raising rabbit and chickens to supplement food rations, the scarcity of 'luxuries' like fruit.  Life continued as best as it could despite the everyday terror of bombs, mines, incendiaries and 'doodlebugs'.  Also, there seems to be a sense of awe in seeing the night sky glowing red as the London docks were bombed.  There is a lot of myth about the blitz but I sense a great deal of terror and loathing prevailed.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	By the end of WW2 in 1945, some 450,000 British civilians lay dead here on the Home Front as a result of Nazi bombings [Blitz] against our major towns and cities.<br>  <br>  Yes, my mother [now gone] was a munitions worker during the war and she stood proud before our local war memorial on every Remembrance Sunday for the rest of her life, knowing that she, like many thousands of others of our people, both civilian and armed services, had all played their part in winning our victory.<br>  <br>  Winston Churchill - "This is your Victory. . . ."<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVjDz1vYRE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgVjDz1vY...</a><br>  <br>  In the above speech, Winston acknowledges the effort put in by all the Nation and all of our people.

AFqZEOlRaa	First, the Weimar Republic was in Germany pre-WWII.  Here's a long article on it.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic#Golden_Era_.281923.E2.80.931929.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Repu...</a>  Republican and Democrat didn't have the same meaning then that they do now.  And, as with most "democracies", they really are republics.  A democracy implies control of everything that happens in government is under the control of the voters.  We call America a democracy when it is really a republic as well.  But the conflicts then were the same as they are now.  Some people want control of the country to be all in the control of a small, centralized government, while some want the control spread out and in control of the legislature.  Unfortunately for Germany, the first one happened and that was all she wrote.|`|AA11518835	I don't think you know what a Republic is. <br>  A Republic is a representative Democracy.<br>  In True Democracy, every person has a vote on every single bill. <br>  The Weimar Republic had a Representative Democracy- so does the United States.<br>  <br>  I am in no way saying that true Democracy is better. The greeks complained that {true} democracy "is when the indigent, and not the men of property, are the rulers."<br>  <br>  That is why the next major empire on Earth, Rome, was a Republic.|`|3FtC9D40aa	Republics stand for the rule of law not majority rule like one would see in a democracy. The ancient greeks had a democracy up until the point the people realized that they could vote themselves money and priviledge.<br>  <br>  The terms are often confused and have little to do with either political party but I assure you we are a Republic.|`|DHe3SBCmaa	Democracy is people voting and their vote counting.<br>  <br>  A Republic is people voting for people to represent them in government  to vote for them.<br>  <br>  A true democracy would be impossible.   every American voting on every bill and ammendment<br>  <br>  So that is why we (and the Germans) have a republic<br>  <br>  Democratically elected representatives.|`|Ng1tHr4jaa	"weimer"  is not a name of a person it's the name of the orgsnisation which had the ideas of democracy.|`|YupMCYHlaa	'Republic' and 'Democracy' mean the same thing.  The public in republic is Latin for 'the people'.  The 'demo' in 'democracy' is from 'demos', Greek for 'the people'.  They both mean government by the people.  In our case we have a 'representative democracy', not a 'pure democracy'.  But it's still democracy .<br>  <br>  The words mean the same thing but they are used differently.  The country in question is often called a 'republic' to differentiate it from a monarchy, a duchy, a principality, etc.  The type of government is usually democratic.  But the words mean the same.<br>  <br>  The idea that a democracy is only mob rule, that we have a republic, that idea comes from the John Birch Society.  Republicans use it today to invalidate what they call the 'Democrat Party'.  But 'Democrat' and 'Republican' as names for parties are only labels.  The both purportedly stand for government by the people.<br>  <br>  As for the accusations of 'mob rule', every real-world democracy has protections in place for the rights of minorities.

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Well, you posted it online for everyone to know who you are. Please!! PLEASE!!! Don't change your day job! You are bad at being a criminal.<br>  <br>  Now for the real deal. You better tell your parents and contact a criminal lawyer. take his advice in regards to this issue. He may contact the company that you cashed the checks to repay the money and avoid them bringing charges. Then you can go to the police knowing that the company will not bring charges to you and try to help the police with some leads.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11206283	Get in front of it. Talk to the police, provide documentation and prepare to make restitution.<br>  <br>  SHould keep you out of jail|`|6Gfz125Paa	I'd suggest you contact the police immediately.  You have been the victim of a fraud operation, and you need to report it so they can break  it up.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Yes.. . . and prison? . . . Yes.<br>  <br>  My suggestion, go find a lawyer (barrister) and have that chap approach the company, offering to "make good" on your lapse of judment . . . . in FULL . . . if they promise not to prosecute.<br>  <br>  You can make it right BEFORE they knock on your door . . . but once they do . . . it's too late.<br>  <br>  Good luck . . . <br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|8v40KEd0aa	Let your parents know about it because they could be liable for you.|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	Dan in Miami has the best advice. <br>  <br>  I can Only expand by saying, for all you know the authorities have been watching this scam circle. <br>  <br>  Here in Las Vegas, NV The exact same thing happened.It was on the news a week or two ago.  <br>  <br>  The guy signed up like you thinking "wow, in this economy this is just the break I need." well, when the checks came in the mail, his instincts told him to go to the authorities. It is a Common and Growing scam. These companies are looking for innocent naive people not criminals. They want you to cash the bad paper, send them an agreed upon portion and keep the rest for yourself. <br>  <br>  Do what Dan In Miami Said. A barrister will help you mitigate any legal penalties if any at all.|`|BpXdkLTBaa	yeah - check fraud does lead to imprisonment, at least it does in the US. You should turn yourself in and let them know your side of the story before you get caught, and you will.... please dont be stupid enough to think that you will get away with it. You will come out better in the end and will avoid having to look over your shoulder all the time. Good luck, and next time you go to do anything on the internet, you should check out the place that you are talking about working for.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	You need to gather up all the information, preferably paperwork, that you have and go to the police first.  Don't delay.  At least if you turn them on to this, they will be more likely to believe your story about being duped and using poor judgment. <br>  <br>  The sooner the better as the trail to the real criminals will be fresher now.  Any arrests based on your cooperation will be good for you.  <br>  <br>  Then, you will only have to defend how it was possible for you to not know any better when you did cash those checks.|`|NAhsHPYsaa	Prison is a possibility but given your age and supposedly vunerability, you will probably be let off easy. However since it wasn't completely your fault you could tell the authorities about the scam and they could go after the guy. <br>  <br>  Warning: Do not trust those emails asking for money, never.|`|RLoilwCNaa	Go tell the cops first of all. If they have to come find you then you are in big trouble. If it was just stupidity then you'll probably just get probation or a slap on the wrist. If you do nothing, your going to jail.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	If you go to Marks and Spencers now you'll show good will, especially if you can document the scam that took you in. Do that and the fact you're a minor will probably spare you jail time.|`|2MvdB6SJaa	why would you tell the world you did that over the internet. Your dumb. Its a possibility you could be in big trouble.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Well Check Fraud is pretty bad.  I think your dumb for signing up for anythign over the internet in this day and age.|`|97fbce5e0565e70c10d256648252d256aa	if it's bugging you go to the police and tell them.|`|eqENvJUVaa	This happened to one of my friends. He and his wife cashed a check for $2000 that he believed to be legitimate, due to the fact it was for a potential modeling shoot his wife was scheduled for the next month. He was taken to jail for cashing a fraudulent check, but, they were lenient on him since he had had no reason to believe the check was bad and dropped the charges, pending he paid it back immediately, which he did. If you go ahead and tell someone maybe, if you have a job, maybe they will just garnish your wages or something until all the money is returned.

If you want more information, just call the Personal Property Transportation Office at the base.
auUeI2Vnaa	No.  They brain of an 18 year old is not fully developed.  Almost, but not quite.  Alcohol slows the brain cells and a fully developed brain can usually get them all back up to speed again when the alcohol wears off (unless your drinking REALLY heavy).  However, a under developed brain might just kill off some of those cells, rather than trying to get them back up to speed again, which would cause permanent damage.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Drinking age in Canada is 18 or 19 depending on the province and 18 in Mexico.  Kind of foolish to pretend kids don't drink at 20 or under anyways so why not give them the choice to do it legally.  I think maybe it boils down to a numbers game since teenagers as a group tend to be more reckless it might cause an unacceptable increase in traffic accidents.  Maybe that's the rationale, I don't know.|`|f5058943507feef30be15c90091dab2eaa	Porn, and cigarettes don't cause a diminsh capacity to think.   YOu might be a mature 18 year old, but not everyone is.   We need a cut off point to measure maturity.   smoking and porn isn't that hazzardous for others and can stand at a lower threshold.|`|NAhsHPYsaa	Yes, I do think it should be lowered to 18, I mean most other things you can do at that age, so I don't see the point in having 21 be the magic drinking age.|`|7toznquyaa	No, we tried that.. it didn't work.|`|zzkmdusEaa	Yes. Yes it should.<br>  <br>  A brain of an 18 year old isn't full developed? Well if that is so then why is it legal at the age of 18 to adopt a child? Why is it legal to purchase a firearm? If they see 18 year olds as too immature, and not responsible enough to drink then why would they trust them with things much higher in risk and danger such as a firearm and also allow them the responsibility of raising a child? At 18 years old you can make the decision to smoke/dip tobacco which greatly exceeds the health risks than that of drinking, so you can take the health arguement out.<br>  <br>  At 18 you are considered a legal adult and given a whole new world of choices, responsibilities and freedoms to take on. For some reason drinking is out even though the other freedoms these "adults" are allowed require a lot more maturity. You'd think someone who is mature enough to buy a gun and adopt a kid would be mature enough to drink? Apparently not. I'm almost 18 and I work a full time job on top of school, and after a hard days work of sitting with my nose buried in a book then going out in the freezing hoar-cold to wash filthy semi-trucks I would be able to come home and relax myself with a little something more adult than a SODA! Same with 18 year olds who can make the choice to join the militairy and give life and limb for their country. They are mature enough to put their own life on the line in war....but not to drink an alchoholic beverage.<br>  <br>  The arguement about more DUI's is also out. You go to your local sheriffs website and look at booking activity you will see that majority of the people who get thrown in jail for DUI's are over the age of 21. That arguement should be thrown out entirely, they should not classify 18 years olds exclusively into the drinking and driving club. Anyone can be dumb enough to make the choice to drink and drive no matter what age, you can be 18, 21, or 85 if you can drink, you can be stupid and decide to drive home. Just because you are 21 years old does not make you responsible and just because you are 18 does not make you responsible, it is all about a persons right to make their own decisions and if they decide to make that idiotic choice then they pay the consequences, but do NOT imply that every 18 year old likes to get plastered and take a joyride.<br>  <br>  Alchohol right now is basically half up and half underground. By lowering the drinking age to 18, this country can greatly reduce its crime rate by greatly reducing the number of underage drinking. It can bring out more control in alchohol by bring 18 year olds who already drink more in the open by not having to hide their beerfests from the local law enforcement. People would say "Yeah but then 18 year olds would be buying beer for their underage friends."..Yes and so do 21 year olds, this also goes with a persons right to make dumb decisions. Every day kids find adults to buy them beer, so nothing will change in that aspect.<br>  <br>  Yes..It should be legalized unless you can provide an answer that I can't argue against.|`|AA10118655	No, for one reason (IMO):<br>  <br>  Too many people that turn 21 think that having a "good time" means getting falling down drunk. This usually stops in the mid to late 20's. This is a big reason colleges have such a bad reputation as being "party schools". <br>  <br>  Until people start showing that they can handle their alcohol in a more mature fashion, all you would be doing by lowering the drinking age is move the problem from colleges to high school. lowering the age will not teach people to drink more responsibly, but will just let younger age kids legally think a "good time" is getting falling down drunk.<br>  <br>  In other countries, the drinking age is lower, and it works for them because their society is such that they don't have as big of a drinking problem as the U.S. has.

7ONKVbbiaa	I would say it is very possible.. but the bottom line would be IF THEY KNEW it happened. Someone needs to file a complaint before they can. If mom is suicidal, then it clearly is a huge risk to the baby. <br>  however..a person with depression or mental illness, NEEDS HELP, so don't take what I am saying as judging your friend. I am not. <br>  IF they did remove the child, it would need to be presented to the court as to what happened, and why.. but more important.. what is being done to help her, and make sure that she is getting stable enough to not risk the baby's safety. At that point, she has the opportunity to tell the court, what is being done.. is she seeing a therapist? If she is broke and desperate, is someone helping her find food/ housing, so forth? Is there family there to take her in while she is getting better? <br>  If family/ friends have already stepped in.. and MAKING SURE she is getting help, and it has not been reported, then her odds are good. <br>  Your friend has my prayers. If she is NOT getting help, and not stable.. I would rather the baby be in a safe place until she is well. Not as punishment.. but to protect him.
7znFg0QEaa	Talk with H.R. - This would probably not be considered "harassment" under federal labor laws.|`|AA11206283	National Labor Relations Board not OSHA|`|19b7bd1dd32149738cfd8fca874ffda8aa	If his company has a Human resources dept contact them and follow all the company rules on the subject. If he goes outside the first question they ask will be, did you follow all the company processes? If he hasn't they will not even talk to him. Be advised what you describe does not necessarily equate to harassment. Sometimes bosses are just pricks.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	he should complain to you<br>  <br>  "harassed him and humiliated him, even threatening to fire him"<br>  <br>  this sounds odd|`|3tuwWidiaa	Since you mention OSHA, I assume this is the US.<br>  <br>  In most states, unless you have a contract, you can be fired at any time, without cause.  Unless illegal discrimination was at play, no company is required to keep on an employee.  This is called "At Will Employment."<br>  <br>  What's at play here is whether or not the company wants to look like they are firing for cause or not.  If they can show that he was dismissed for gross misconduct, he could be defined unemployment benefits.  Since the company gets a "ding" when someone on their payroll collects unemployment, they might be trying to limit that.<br>  <br>  Or, more likely the case, to get him to quit.  In which case, no unemployment and no severance (in the company offers).<br>  <br>  In the end, if the boss wants to find a reason to fire him, it won't be hard.  Even the best employees will have something that can be used against them, need be.  But, given that this is likely not what the boss wants (he wants husband to quit), husband should try to shrug it off, keep working, and look for another job on the side.<br>  <br>  If there is someone above the boss to appear to, I'd suggest that he do it.  If this boss is the owner or CEO, then there may be little that can be done.<br>  <br>  Unless it gets into sex or race, harassment can be a difficult thing to deal with from a legal perspective.  "You're a baby for taking the day off" is a rude comment, but it's not illegal.

RjUhISEIaa	Let him pay and keep your money out of the picture for it is his child and not yours. Love can be blind but this is one time you need to be able to see the entire picture.<br>  <br>  How can he pay it down? Work his you know what off. One, two or three jobs are necessary with the money from the extra work going to the arrearage.<br>  <br>  Yes, he has a right to see his daughter but what was he granted by the court? If visitation was spelled out his wife has no grounds to change them without going back to court. However, he may not stand much of a chance in the court right now with the arrearage in support. <br>  <br>  Seriously...you keep your money for yourself and your child for something tells me, but I hope I'm wrong, that you might one day find yourself in the position of the ex-wife. I hope not but you need to keep thinking about this...|`|0P9GYAx6aa	He needs to go to the court and get an order of visitation.  Then if she pulls that he would be justified in asking for either joint or sole custody.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	Firast things first. The arrears have to be paid, it is his responsibility, and nto having a steady job is no excuse for falling behind. Please don't try and minimize that.<br>  <br>  Some states allow an appeal process taht will reduce the interest charged on arrears. If he is simply paying the amount owed on a monthly basis, the arrears will never be paid off. THey won't even start to reduce until the child turns 18, when the child support stops and everything he pays then will go to the arrears he owes. That's another 9 years worth of interest on top of that 20,000.00.<br>  <br>  His monthly payments, at th minimum need to be the base child support, and the amount of interest charged monthly, that will keep the amount from going UP, but will now help it go down.<br>  <br>  IOf you can afford to help pay, that's a decision that the two of you need to make together, that's moeny that will never be seenagain if you two go yoru seperate ways, so think carefully.<br>  <br>  He should have visitation, his arrears should have no bearing on a visitation agreement. If they can't agree on one, then they need to head back to court and let a judge lay it out.<br>  <br>  It's his daughter, he has to be willing to take the reins and the lead in this. It's admirable that you want to help, but you cannot fix it, only he can

That one guy kept getting small helicopter parts that were sent to him by mail by his brother.  He basically assembled the whole helicopter in his cell over a period of a year. They saved rubbing alcohol to use for fuel and all of it was hidden in the ceiling of one of the cells. They then found another convict that was a helicopter pilot and talked him into flying the assembled helicopter. After they escaped, they stopped and dug up some money from one of the robberies and then they bought a lot of beer and whiskey and cigarettes and then they got a hotel room in athens where they hung out drinking and smoking a lot of cigarettes watching tv and  and being low-key while ordering stuff from room service.

He signed a paper, acknowledging that he was responsible to pay taxes, and then "forgot" to pay them.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I actually believe the policy in Alaska is a new one.  Additionally, she should already be taxed on the use of a state car, etc.  That tax should be in her W2 for her.  She should not have to be figuring that out.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	The taxes she owes are from this year, and she has until April 15th to pay them. The tax cheats in Obama's cabinet have back taxes owed from several past years. Big difference.|`|cOJyoXEhaa	Wow eighteen thousand.

You should understand what the difference is before you post.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Just another politician with her hands in the cookie jar... She should be investigated. Not for anything in particular - just investigated. She does seem to be ethically challenged, as well as a media hound when she needs a little publicity.

Look for the monster to resurface a liitle later when her book is published.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	so you also read she intiated the investigation about her perdiem? you also noticed the taxes she owed are for this past year and not 2001-02 like geithner. you are comparing apples and tax cheats. lol|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Actually, Alaska changed the law just last week, so just last week she owed back taxes.  The week before that her taxes were paid in full.   Get it?
tDvyf3Q5aa	Dan in Miami: it's always pleasure to see your answers I really like to see the US ideology in your terms. I just love it. I agree to the parts of the answer "decisions with today's standards", that makes sense. but let me tell you here in this case it's nonsense. CIA exiled Dr. Mosaddegh with a coup because of oil, and you know they would happily do it again if they see chances of a coup. with today's standards USA still does the same for the sake of the oil and you can find newer samples of such behavior in other countries. <br>  Sean F: Don't try to say Mosaddegh was the same as Hitler. Mosaddegh was exiled just because he nationalized oil in Iran; he didn't declare a war against the world like Hitler did. you better find samples that make sense. <br>  Iran was on the way to reach democracy if your saints in CIA left her alone.|`|AA11702773	Admit, nothing.<br>  <br>  I declare it.<br>  <br>  Mind you, I wasn't alive then....|`|7ZJHBKk9aa	Hitler was democratically elected as well and we all know exactly how well he led Germany.

TODAY we know that . . . . but back when slavery was going on . . . America was "hardly" the only country using slaves.  <br>  <br>  We want to JUDGE our country's past action with TODAY's values.  <br>  <br>  While that sounds good, it is not.<br>  <br>  The Shah of Iran was probably a GOOD choice . . . back then.   <br>  <br>  It is easy to "judge" that throwing Dr. Mossadegh out was a bad thing . . .l but do you have access to the Intel that the British Government and the US Government had?   <br>  <br>  No?<br>  <br>  Then you can't say if it was a good decision or a bad one, can you?<br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	It was 1953 and no they can't.

The basis of your question does not take into account being a permanent minority in this country even with a black President. It also presumes entitlement, at least your avatar implies as much. And, Black Congressional members are pegged as serving only black constituents even though the current President who came from the same Caucus was elected by a majority white voters too.  In the United States we have this phenomena called the Old Boy system. The latest product of this system was "43".  The same can be said about the Kennedy family dynasty.  In the Congress the old boy system is alive and well it is ingrained in our system of government. Therefore, we have a womens caucus at last count 26 female elected officials. These caucuses deal with the substance of issues unique to gender or race whose needs have been under-represented by leadership. The confluence of issues, despite historic rhetoric should then be integrated into the mainstream agenda towards solution.  <br>  When it comes to representing the cause of people it comes down to character and personality.  I could not expect you to articulate my needs and know what is unique to being African American because you could probably care less. So, let's take that example. History and current data demonstrates their is disparity in public education unique to minorities. It is a stubborn fact.  How can I trust as an elected official who already thinks that all minorities are influenced entirely by entitlement will serve this same constituency with the same vigor and determination as your issue, for the sake of discussion the stimulus package. The issue of disparate treatment in education remains a stubborn fact. <br>  Therefore, the womens caucus, the black caucus and the jewish caucus exist because of the sorry track record of the majority party, Democratic and Republican alike, have not served all of the people. So, my answer to you is no. The myriad of caucuses remains in Congress because the personality and character of some elected officials refuses to fight for all our citizens in both parties, like you they can care less.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	YEP, Should have been discontinued YEARS ago.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	No it should not.|`|htxwTAAQaa	Maybe.

I'm watching CNN right now, and a Twitterer made a "window dressing" analogy, and that's exactly what the situation is: Steele and Jindal are simply figureheads for a broken party with little credibility these days, and their antics continue to show that nothing has changed with the GOP, and nothing ever will change.|`|UzRijICuaa	It depends.

My take from the beginning of this economy slump was that those who were greedy and continued their actions despite the warnings should simply pay for it. <br>  When your house rotten by termites you don't just fumigate you replace. When your apple is partly rotten you don't cut it in half and try to save the other half you throw it away.<br>  Those facing bankruptcy should have been let down.

Government Obama, Republicans or Democrats have and will have no impact on it.|`|AA11518835	There is no way that his plan is going to help the country.<br>  <br>  Mark my words- No Way.<br>  <br>  There are three ways that the US government can pay for these programs.<br>  1) Take money from productive areas of society in the form of taxes<br>  <br>  2) Borrow the money from some other country, particularly China<br>  <br>  3) Print more money<br>  <br>  <br>  If they tax the productive areas of society, they hurt business because they have less money to invest, to hire, and to research and develop. The average American pays 18.2% Federal Income tax (not including state and local taxes). The corporate tax rates, depending on how they are measured, are either the highest or second highest in the entire world.<br>  <br>  When the govt usurps this money, they put it into government programs that have no system of competition with the free market. They are not subject to "bottom lines" or "profit margins". They are artificial entities that exist purely to spread the wealth that has been created through productive means to areas that are unproductive.<br>  <br>  If they borrow the money, we will still end up with the bill. Right now the US economy is based 60% on consumption and only 40% on production. In other words, we send more money overseas than overseas sends us. Like a family of four, an economy cannot spend more than it produces without amassing debt, or in our case, more and more debt.<br>  <br>  What will happen, and is happening, is that the Federal Reserve will just print more money to pay for this "stimulus". There are countless examples throughout history where this resulted in hyperinflation, particularly the Weimar Republic in Germany, where a barrel of marks couldn't buy a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  This is what we will see within 2 years- hyperinflation. The best evidence for it is the fact that there is 70% more money in circulation than there was only four months ago.<br>  <br>  <br>  The only solution to help the economy is to cut taxes and reduce government spending. We need to abolish Income tax and the Federal Reserve and move back to the gold standard.<br>  <br>  <br>  As with evolution in nature, the weak businesses are supposed to flounder. If the productive businesses are required to pay for the unproductive businesses to survive, then the productive business are inhibited, and the weak survive. Evolution works by survival of the fittest, not by survival of everyone.<br>  <br>  If we keep moving towards survival of everyone, even the weak, then the drain on the fittest will be so large that the whole system will be incapable of evolving. It is true in nature, and it is true in economics.<br>  <br>  From Charles Darwin, "The Descent of Man":<br>  With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly any one is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.<br>  The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst performing an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil. We must therefore bear the undoubtedly bad effects of the weak surviving and propagating their kind; but there appears to be at least one check in steady action, namely that the weaker and inferior members of society do not marry so freely as the sound; and this check might be indefinitely increased by the weak in body or mind refraining from marriage, though this is more to be hoped for than expected."<br>  <br>  One more thing, our whole system of monetary policy is unconstitutional. The original Constitution did not allow Income tax, saying that all taxes must be "apportioned equally".<br>  <br>  The Constitution also says that only the Federal Government has the ability to coin money, so the Federal Reserve is unconstitutional. It is no more Federal than Federal Express.|`|AA11875616	One problem that occurs when corporations get too big is entrenchment.  They become rigid and inflexible, and keep doing the same thing, keep selling the same product, and keep bribing the same politicians.  Nothing changes, until something unexpected happens.  Then, they are too big to fail, and they want to be bailed out.  Our economy won't suffer if thousands or millions of little companies go under.  Someone else will hurry in and take up that niche.  But when a giant, humongous corporation like GM, Chrysler, or Ford, starts going under due to being rigid and inflexible, it hurts whole communities, and worse, our entire economy.  Corporations are too big.  They should be limited to a certain size so that when they go under, it won't hurt massive numbers of people.  I see nothing wrong with sharing equally in the misery.  Depends how you define misery.  Rush sells misery to make a living, much like your neighborhood heroin dealer...|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	The best fix is the market.

AA11518835	Responsible Anarchist is right.<br>  But it also should be mentioned that deflation can be just as big of a problem as inflation because the cost of living goes down, products cost less, and businesses are able to downsize and still maintain a profit. Deflation frequently results in high unemployment rates.<br>  <br>  During the Great Depression, we were still on the gold standard, so we could not print more money to create inflation to make up for deflation.

Which way are the prices going up is inflation and down is deflation.  Deflation is what normally happens during a recession as more goods exist then cash to buy them and inflation is when prices go up because cash is available; neither is really bad unless they get too high either way and some inflation is normal every year but deflation is less common and if the market (buy and sell not the stock market) corrects itself will fix itself also just usually slower as their is excess inventory to get rid of before you stop producing (and employing people to do so) which means things will go up in price as more people can afford them.|`|FSsl25SLaa	Deflation in an economic sense is a persistent decrease in the general price level of goods and services, when inflation is below zero percent, resulting in an increase in the real value of money — a negative inflation rate. When the inflation rate slows down (decreases, but remains positive), this is known as disinflation. Disinflation is a substantial drop in the rate of increase of the price level|`|9klx10iKaa	deflation is created by market stagnation, when demand is extremely low and supply is extremely high.

FpWqQE3maa	While loan officers are employees, they act more like independent contractors. They are compensated largely, if not entirely, on a commission basis. The typical commission rate is 1/2 of 1% of the loan amount, and successful loan officers earn 6 figure incomes.<br>  <br>  Both lenders and mortgage brokers post prices with loan officers to be offered to consumers. The loan officers usually have limited discretion to reduce the price if necessary to meet competition, and full discretion to raise the price if they can. The difference between the posted price and the price charged the consumer is called an "overage", and it is usually shared with the loan officer.

AA11875616	Thank you for your refreshing and comprehensive analysis of the problem.<br>  <br>  The rich, regardless of party, don't create jobs unless they have customers coming in the doors enough to justify adding additional employees.  Instead, they often buy more stocks, bonds, shares, and hide the rest in overseas tax shelters.  Only if they are REQUIRED to hire more people should they get a tax break, and only after they prove it.<br>  <br>  However, your statements about socialism will anger many on here because they do not understand it, nor do they have a working definition of it, either.  They will argue until sundown that corporate capitalism is the be-all and end-all of technological civilization.  They are clueless.  Corporate capitalism could not exist without socialism in those parts of the economy where goods and services will not be provided any other way.  As long as corporate capitalism can externalize their waste and their losses to the rest of us, socialism will be necessary to protect us from their excesses.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	The only problem with this rant is that you have obviously never owned a business. You have no CLUE as to what you are saying.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what. You give me a tax cut and I will continue to create jobs (tax revenue), grow my business, sell more product providing more tax revenue. <br>  <br>  You give me a tax hike and I will pay the higher prices that my vendors (who also saw a tax hike) passed onto me. Then I will raise my prices and pass them on to you OR I will sell less product as my prices rise. As a result of declining sales, I will produce less tax revenue which will result in lost jobs(more lost tax revenue).........Do you see the cycle here? Can you possibly understand this?<br>  <br>  You are excluding hundreds of thousands of small business owners........owners who employ millions of people.<br>  <br>  ** I just retired from owning my own business for over 15 years, employing over 20 people.

I just was turned down for a construction loan for the first time in my life. I was going to level and develop a piece of my land with the money. I was asking for a mere $200K  in which I was going to repay like all my other loans. Upon recieving that money I would have put a dozen men to work for up to 3 months while the grading and construction was being done. All that the government had to do is temporarily loan banks the money and insist they lend it out to the people. <br>  <br>  Now tell me how the government can spend 200K, put a dozen people to work and get repaid 100% at the same time?Its socialist democrats who don't understand economics. They want to give the most unreliable facets of our society most of the money and expect it not be lost.|`|TVhmGspoaa	duh.  when you cut taxes people have more money.

Tax cuts improve the economy, and a growing economy means more jobs. It really is that simple.<br>  <br>  You say one business owner can't change the economy, but you can. If by pocketing the money, you mean keeping it in your business and staying alive in tough times then that is good for the economy. <br>  <br>  The tax cuts of the last 8 years were good for the economy. They benefited everyone. The problem that we are experiencing was caused by artificially low interest rates and bank deregulation.<br>  <br>  I'm not completely against social programs, but they can't become a way of life.

In other words, the poor paid 30% less in taxes after Bush's tax cuts than before.  <br>  <br>  Here's what you don't understand:  No one is required to stay in any state or in the country. You raise taxes on the rich and corporations and they'll be moving out of the state or out of the country.  They'll be taking jobs and tax revenue with them. It's easy to see this because the states doing the worst have the highest income taxes and highest corporate income taxes.  Not coincidentally, those states also have a high amount of social programs (California, Michigan, etc.).<br>  <br>  Explain how the states work that have no income tax at all? Some of those states are the most productive.
AbHm1BBXaa	Because anarcho capitalists ony promote a one-sided view of the economy. They promote the side that stuffs their off-shore tax havens with $$.<br>  What they forget to teach, is that the largest population of consumers is NOT the upper 5% of wealth holders. They also don't teach that jobs aren't created simply by the rich having more money.<br>  <br>  Jobs are created by consumption in a consmer driven economy like the USA.<br>  Consumption increases retail sales and factory orders.<br>  As factory orders rise, and the rich making the money feels they need more labor force to keep up with production requirement,  they then create jobs.<br>  When consmption isn't there because the working class doesn't have the money to purchase goods, the rich will cut jobs, not create them, but right-wingers won't mention that.<br>  NOT ONE rich businessman is going to create more jobs when the demand for product is not there.<br>  <br>  The rich have been getting more money for the past 8 years.<br>  Oil companies have had record profits, weapon company profits shot up 150% and we are stil having eocnomic problems.<br>  You would think right-wingers would finally abandon their failed policies and inaccurate beliefs in the face of undeniable proof.<br>  <br>  Our American economy was made strong by protectionist environment created by WWII and by union labor, which created a strong consumer confidence, which in turn created a high investor confidence.<br>  Right-wing free trade and deregulation policies has undone all of that and now we will soon see what America would have been like if our economy never did pull out of the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  The naive will believe such sensationalist statements like "have you ever been hired by a poor person?" When in reality, everytime that poor person purchases a gallon of milk with their welfare check, they have hired the dairy and farmer to produce it for them, a job they did in adavnce, so they wouldn''t have to do so at the time of purchase.<br>  And this is where demand for production and for job creation occurs.<br>  <br>  Also you have the naive that believe that people who promote trickle-down philosophy actually want to trickle something down.<br>  The same people hate unions because they help laborers make more money. That is the whole concept of trickle-down!<br>  What people who oppose unions and believe in trickle-down actually promote is trickle-up, where wealth is concentrated up.

Most people have their pensions invested in Corporations.  If you take money away from Corporations in taxes, who actually pays those taxes?  You do!

Telling a Corporation they cannot have access to the US market is known as protectionism and has been shown to be very bad for the economy.

Your jealousy isn't going to get you a payday, being innovative like those two individuals will.<br>  <br>  3. It wasn't until after the concept of a monopoly was determined to be bad did they actually become powerful through vertical monopolizing.<br>  <br>  4.

v1Y3dvjgaa	It is normal to be apprehensive.  First, find a patient friend who has driven a long time.  Then, empty parking lots, back streets, places you do not have to face a lot of traffic at first.

You do  not need someone yelling at you.  You can do it-- millions have.  Remember to drive defensively- as tho every one else on the road is drunk or insane, leave them plenty of room .  Take your time, and pretty soon it will become automatic.  <br>  <br>   Face your fears- that is the way to overcome them.<br>  I have a fear of falling----> skydiving, mountain climbing.

HaviqgZjaa	This is a difficult question to answer.  On the one hand, these courts are only used as a way of settling civil disputes where both parties agree to it.  To put that in context, they could also agree to settle their differences by tossing a coin, or competing in an egg and spoon race - so as long as they both agree to it, it is up to them.<br>  <br>  The difficulty arises when considering whether the consent of the parties to settle disputes in this way is always genuine and freely given.  For example, it could be argued that a woman from a traditional Muslim community may have little choice but to agree to abide by the terms of a sharia "divorce" if she wants to remain part of that community.  <br>  <br>  Just to clarify though, despite misleading tabloid headlines to the contrary, there is no question of sharia law "replacing" British law.  It is just being used as a form of arbitration in civil matters - no different really to both parties agreeing to abide by an ACAS decision in an employment dispute.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	I entirely understand your question and have no problem with allowing Sharia Law to deal with 'civil matters' concerning marriage, family law and so forth.<br>  <br>  However, I do not believe that the Muslim community in UK will stop at that point.

This is a case of willing participants agreeing a framework of civil resolutions based on a cultural (religious) tradition.  Nobody is forced to participate in this.  It's not dissimilar to contract law where private and individual contracts can be enforced by law, without the law forcing any such contract to be agreed in the first place.  Nothing illegal can be enforced in any contract, even if both parties agree.  There may well be concerns about free will, but no more so than in any other type of admissible contract.<br>  <br>  The one thing that may be a potential concern is the "slippery slope" idea, where accepting functional aspects of such a system (in a way compatible with UK civil norms) would give some people a base to pressure for the legal introduction other aspects of Sharia that would be incompatible.<br>  <br>  However, any such change would almost certainly need primary legislation; it would proceed through parliament under the spotlight of an excitable press, and it's extremely unlikely that anything incompatible would get near Royal Assent.<br>  <br>  The major aspects of Sharia that refer to the running of the state, with criminal law, would have no possibility of introduction as these would clash with existing long-standing laws.<br>  <br>  So, no!
g7M1DxFCaa	Of course they should be compensated.  At the time, the NHS was buying blood stocks from the USA.  They knew that since you're paid to give blood in the USA that this naturally attracts a lot of drug addicts as they'll get money for their next 'fix' that way.  Also attracted were a lot of other people who were more likely to have Hepatitis/AIDS due to their lifestyles (homeless, prostitutes, etc).  Knowing this the NHS did not bother to screen the blood that they bought for infections.  Although they may have been less aware of the AIDS risk they didn't bother to screen for Hepatitis either, which can be just as lethal.  Therefore they were negligent in their duty, therefore they should compensate the victims of their negligence and their families.<br>  <br>  Edit: The same happened to almost all recipients of human growth hormone too as well as many other blood derived products.  <br>  <br>  Will S:  No, we're not introducing Sharia Law over here and you should ask your own question, not hijack someone else's in that troll like way.|`|HYFQpkylaa	yes

That ticket will still show up on your license, even if you're not assessed points for it.  It's up to your insurance company whether or not they're going to charge you for it.  I had one insurance company that didn't charge you unless you had more than 2 tickets or the violation was more than 10 mph over the limit.  You have to call the insurance company and find out what their policy is.

The price was exactly what the market thought it was.  Therefore, if no one could have justified that price, then the transaction would not have occurred.  How would you now go back and determine what a piece of property WAS worth?  All real estate investments are speculation in the first place, albeit, certain transactions may appear to have more risk than others.  Don't forget that many speculators also bought property right up to the end and many of them have property greatly under the original value they purchased it at.  So, some of them may have made a very good return on some of their properties, but many are still sitting on some real duds now, just like a lot of others, and may not have any capital left at this point to pay your retroactive tax anyway.

It was a civil war just as we had in our own Country, were the British helped the North as well as the French helped the South, It is a falsehood to even think we had learned anything about War as well as all other Country's in the World there will always be War will be around as long as mankind exists.

(AGAIN THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE!)<br>  <br>  See the remote precedent and then the rest:<br>  1.) Go back to WW2, The US armed forces and the country as a whole came out as the big winners along with the Soviet Union, the whole country felt that technology alone could help win wars faster and cheaper, the budget for war was reduced and too much hope was placed  towards the atom bomb!<br>  <br>  2. ) By the time the Korean war broke, (1950-1953)  the US was ill prepared, the news  of invasion came first by news media than from the intelligence community! <br>  <br>  3.) The Korean War cost 3 years and 50 000 men dead and wounded, and send a signal to the west, Europe no more!,  the center of gravity of international politics and attention, the focus was Asia now, and also the Soviet trick to make others fight their wars! <br>  <br>  4.) As a consequence of superior technology the Korean War caused the Chinese army 950 000 dead and wounded and for North Korea 750 000 dead and wounded, the face of Asia changed forever because of Korea, the US lost 50 000 men and wounded, the Us was able to inflict lots of damage to china and north Korea because of the mighty US Air Force bombing and dive attack missions!<br>  <br>  5.) But for the US people it was a sour little war, for we the people it was inconceivable that a little country put so much trouble to big uncle sam! 3 years of fight  for a far away country with out significance! it was a little sour war !<br>       <br>  6.) The US armed forces learned that it could not defeat an asian army by bombing alone!<br>  <br>  7.) That technology did not compensate for lack of preparation and for large numbers of enemy attackers!<br>  <br>  8.) The lesson was forgot for the US! but for China they learned that it was costly to attack the west with out air mastery and to be subjected to air force power and bombs with out  restrictions!<br>  <br>  9.) So the communist payback was South Vietnam<br>  <br>  10.) The US again was ill prepared, and with out much political will to go there to win big time from the start! so escalation was the wrong answer<br>  <br>  11.) After commiting mistakes like these: every armed service did not cooperate with the others, the cia was a rogue elefant ( as always! )<br>  <br>  The rotation system for troops hampered long term efficency and combat morale <br>  <br>  There was a disconection in between political objectives from the White House  and  translation of those objectives to military planing!<br>  <br>  The misstrust of We the People towards the military and the White House!<br>  12.) The lessons from the Vietnam War are more or less these:<br>  <br>  For the military: <br>  12.1)There is not wining by us air force bombings alone! there is not a chance to win by using air power as a main tool against asian armies!<br>  <br>  12.2) There was a lack o coordination in between the services of the armed forces <br>  <br>  12.3.) There was a justified mistrust of the military towards CIA, the torture of prisoners from the cia was not making the war more likely to be won! <br>  <br>  12.4) The NSA was good for intelligence collection but no so for sharing with air force or army!<br>  <br>  So the armed forces as a whole had to learn how to work together and how to make intelligence programs more integrated!<br>  13. For the White House:<br>  <br>  13.1 Having much assets and not knowing how to use them was a lesson hard to learn! the war cost too much in time, huge number of men, bombs and mission to make lousy campaign management, look at other countries the RAF won the battle of brittain outnumbered 4 to 1 against Lutwaffe, Israel is little but efficient, they are outnumbered by the arabs and they do not loose!, the independence campaign of latin america against spain is also a grat deal of example an so on!  <br>  THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT KNEW HOWE TO PUT SO MUCH ASSETS INTO COHERENT EFFICIENT ACTION!<br>  <br>  13.2) The White House and the armed forces as a whole had to learn how to win back the trust and confidence from We the People!<br>  <br>  13.3) To sub estimate enemy capabilities based on little industrial and military output was a great mistake!<br>  <br>  13.4) The White House had to learn the hard way how to tell the truth!<br>  <br>  Those lesons were put in practice during the ground invasion of Iraq!<br>  you probably had heard the saying :"the first gulf war.." the actual first gulf war was 1988 because the us navy had to clean old ww2 sea mines to clean the way for attacked oil ships and routes at the straight of hormuz and the arab oceans, then is the war of invasion and then this quagmire! <br>  <br>  The armed forces expend time and effort during the last years of the 70′s and the whole 80′s practicing combined arms and intelligence sharing <br>  <br>  The White House restored the confidence of We the People! <br>  <br>  The dividend from those lessons were collected with great sucess against Sadam Hussein!|`|qvuQSQvpaa	(shouldve learned) that socialism can wrk 4 som ppl. jus giv em a chance to do wat they want. they hav decent lives over there 2day. and dont fight a war unless u 100% sure of victory (victory at home and abroad). and thats almost nevr|`|U6tl2acUaa	The main lessons from VN war is any nation can easily beat USA.

yW418gIJaa	See thats just it.  Majority of Obama voters dont care about freedom.  They dont know freedom.  It's this inherited entitlement that they were born into.  Freedom to them, means they are free to fail.  They dont want freedom.  They want $hit.  They want stuff, they want love, they want this they want that but instead of realizing your free to get it on your own because your free.  They want to be free, they just want "stuff" for free.  <br>  <br>  They find nothing wrong with the "logic" whether your democrat or republican, liberal or conservatism, of living within your means.  Obama had people vote for him so they could save a house they were living in that they were never allowed to afford.  They were trapped into this.  A fabricated crisis, so that he may jump onto the scene as this hero who saved people from foreclosure.  At the price of what though?  <br>  <br>  That they dont care about.  It's all about me, they dont care about freedom, they only care about what the media tells them is the next hottest materialistic garbage trend and whether they can afford it or not.

t0mb150gaa	Against public belief Obama is a Muslim and is biased when dealing with these situations. He seems to believe that by diplomatically talking to these terrorist countries we will find a solution. What he doesn't seem to understand is that though he may have good intentions you cannot reason with the unreasonable. These people are taught and teach hate and are against everything America stands for and believes in.

PI8VfiY1aa	It's possible. But he should really decide which party he belongs to. In the 08 race, he first ran for the republican nomination, then started bashing the GOP. Then he ran for the Constitution Party nomination, and when he lost that nomination he began bad-mouthing them, refusing to endorse their candidate. So then he went on to form his own party, the "America's Independent Party" which was only on the ballot in 3 states. His choices were very erratic, and if he wants to run again he should never have distanced himself from the republican party like that- it's only going to be a talking-point for us liberals to use against him. <br>  <br>  If he is going to run against Obama's re-election, he will also need to tone down the rhetoric and stop making charges against Obama's citizenship.

Luckily, after you don't pay and the period has passed, it becomes a warrant for your arrest. I truly hope you don't pay it. People like you need to be taught a lesson. So don't pay it and let us know how jail was and the super large fine you had to pay because you somehow think you should only follow the law in the town where you live.

The spendthrift boondoggle by itself contained much 'programatic' spending that should have been included in a budget if approved, and needn't be duplicated in one now.  So the budget can be smaller while still massively increasing national debt. <br>  <br>  Also, cutting a deficit in half even by itself means we are still spending more than we take in and are adding to debt.  And that is without looking at the 'off budget items' that contained within them raised ceilings on the amount of permissible national debt.<br>  <br>  It is pure smoke and mirrors, and manipulative.
bImYoZsraa	Well, one could argue for either case:<br>  <br>  I think that affirmative action is a form of discrimination in itself for two reasons:<br>  <br>  1) It's not at all fair that certain ethnic groups are held to higher standards while others aren't.  The most qualified people are the ones who should be getting the jobs and accepted to the elite schools, plain and simple.  Race shouldn't play a factor in this.<br>  <br>  2) Affirmative action is damaging to the self-esteem of minorities because the policy automatically assumes that most of them wouldn't be able to achieve success on their own merit.  There are a lot of minorities out there who are certainly smart enough to be hired at well-reputed companies or admitted to prestigious universities.  <br>  <br>  If college admissions officers continue to admit people just because they are minorities (even if they have low SAT scores and sub-par grades), then this doesn't teach those students the value of hard work.  All students, regardless of race, should learn that if they want to achieve success (academically or career-wise), then they must work hard for it. Otherwise, they'll grow up believing that success will be handed to them on a silver platter.<br>  <br>  There is one exception, though.  I do think that students who grew up in poverty or low-income families shouldn't be penalized just because their parents didn't have the financial means to help them succeed in school.  By students, I'm referring to those of any race.  Upper-class parents can afford to give their children the tools necessary to achieve success later on in life (i.e. tutoring, SAT prep classes, extracurricular activities, etc.), but one can't say the same for parents earning a low salary.  However, it is exclusive to use the affirmative action policy to help minorities who grew up in well-to-do families succeed.|`|AA12089018	It's a complete joke.<br>  <br>  Why give someone a job or give someone an education based upon there skin color?

The Supreme Court which is the final voice on how to interpret the first amendment will take a look at historical documents such as the Federalist papers and other writings of the time to base their decision on the intent of our founding fathers.  While they do this to try and get a better understanding of what the founding fathers intended for the right to mean, they also take into consideration other factors as political and societal pressures before issuing a ruling.<br>  <br>  With that in mind, the first amendment is forever changing slowly with time.  The Supreme Court being that final voice can over rule any previous decisions they have made in the past.  So while today you may feel that you are losing your first amendment rights, a constitutional challenge with different justices may help restore those rights to a more conservative or liberal view.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Those who sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither.

4rRfug3Uaa	It worries me that people can hate the terrorists for the terrible things that they do. Yet at the same time justify the terrible things that are done to them in response.<br>  <br>  They like to think that their response is justified yet the terrorists actions are not.<br>  unfortunately no matter how much people attempt to justify it to themselves there is ultimately no justification that makes our treatment of them somehow "right". either we are both justified in our actions or neither of us are. <br>  I understand many will debate this point but for this particular conflict this is my personal view.<br>  I would like people to at least be honest about it though. If they wish to treat the terrorists with the same brutality that the terrorists themselves show, that is their choice. but to say that they actually are not doing anything wrong is what annoys me the most.<br>  <br>  I do lean towards the statement that we are no different from the terrorists. while not quite on their league this conflict has definitely brought many people down towards their level.<br>  <br>  whether we should treat them the way we currently do is something for each individual to decide for themselves. for someone who has always hated the muslims the choice is fairly obvious as is a choice of someone who puts a high value on human rights.<br>  <br>  often you can see what people have decided based on their answers in these type of questions so it will be interesting to see.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  on a side note I have noticed that the word terrorist is becoming a word that is more and more freely used. even on some "news" programs they even use the word terrorists in their description of some youths on their program.

The religion is the free market.  And both have made  the consumer who objects to the products made in China or anywhere else where safety takes a lower priority than the sale of the product into enemies.  Mark Morford makes reference to "our government offering up only the most meager, desultory efforts to....not induce all-out fire-and-pitchfork revolt."  That revolt, however, is in the making.  When it breaks out fully, we will again go to war with ourselves.  It is what capitalism does and induces best.  This time, however, after the neo-liberal model disappears, people will come before profits.  The capitalists will then have plenty of opportunity blaming and going to war with each other.  They deserve it.<br>  <br>  We are again confronted with one of the most vexing aspects of advanced industrial civilization: the rational character of its irrationality. Its productivity and efficiency, its capacity to increase and spread comforts, to turn waste into need, and destruction into construction, the extent to which this civilization transforms the object world into an extension of man’s mind and body makes the very notion of alienation questionable.

I, for one, will not continue to put up with this GOP notion that patiotism is something for the little people to do and for the Republican elite to make fun of.

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Check your local laws but here is a quote that should explain it.<br>  <br>  "A boring but effective law dictionary gave us some good advice. It turns out the differences between pleas of "guilty" and "no contest" only become relevant in certain situations. One of the most common reasons why defendants plead no contest to criminal charges is if they're also facing the possibility of civil lawsuits. <br>  <br>  For example, say someone is charged with reckless driving. If this defendant pleads "no contest" to the charges in criminal court, that verdict cannot be used against the person if a civil suit is filed later. Why? Because it's not an admission of guilt. However, everything else that came out in the criminal trial can be used as evidence. Still, it can be a smart move under certain circumstances. <br>  <br>  A big disadvantage of pleading "no contest" is that the defendant doesn't get a day in court. And a plea of "no contest" doesn't get the defendant out of punishment. However, if the defendant is particularly worried about a public trial (a common problem for celebrities) or honestly doesn't remember the circumstances which led to the charges, "no contest" can be the way to go. "<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hw8jOWaeaa	no contest is not an admission of guilt or innocence, but the judge can hand down sentencing right there as to where guilty is an admission and you could go to trial or waive your right and be sentenced right there also.|`|1KGXts5Daa	As to sentencing, they are the same.<br>  <br>  There is a difference though.

When you enlist, you will have to have a legal gaurdian for your kids while you are away at basic and tech school (no dependents are allowed to accompany you to basic and the can only join you at tech school if your school is more than 6 months long).  Once you are finished and get your first assignment, you will have to submit a family care plan.  The plan will have to list people willing to take care of your child in the case you deploy or are sent to a location that dependents are not allowed.  It will also have to cover all day care contingencies..for example, child care for nights and weekends if you work shifts (including holidays), for if you work late and for if you are involved in field exercises.  You will also need a plan for care if your child is sick and you can not be released from duty.  Now, most units will work with you where they can, but you will not get special treatment or specialized schedules simply because you are a single parent and the military will always come first when push comes to shove.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	You would have to have in a family care plan.

N13PcbFsaa	Sgtbellotti cant be farther from the truth. The civil war was a US backed war in which the Reagan administration back the Salvadorean army. The FMLN, or the guerilla, were the ones who supported the people. The army assassinated Monsignor Romero who was a catholic priest in El Salvador at the time who helped many poor people. The army were the ones that had death squads who murdered entire towns, two of which are publicly known. As the movie shows countless people were murdered, many at times for no reason whatsoever. Women were raped and then murdered, Young boys would be picked up on the streets and forced to join the war. <br>  <br>  And the movie you saw was Voces Inocentes, I highly recommend you go out and get an original copy of it and watch it uncensored.|`|Ng1tHr4jaa	When the 12-year civil war in El Salvador came to an end in 1992 with the peace accords signed by both the government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), many activists began to think of the struggle of that small country as off the agenda of the US progressive movement.

The prosecutorial process can take awhile because of due process requirements, which are definitely important to protect the rights of all parties and to get all of the facts.

The average American would drop dead the first day on the job, When you see construction workers take a good look and see how many are in their late 40's 50’s and 60’s.  Only about 5 percent of Americans can handle this type of hard labor, but, there will be plenty of work for illegals, so, here we go again.<br>  <br>  The Senate did strip out the E-verify. Now alot of those jobs could go to illegals.|`|AA11599203	Well, it's a double-edged sword.  The good news is, yes, there will be thousands of construction jobs opening in CA.  (NO, these are not "government" jobs!)  The BAD news is, because Congress, in its infinite wisdom, failed to include a provision that the jobs go to U.S. CITIZENS, many thousands of illegals will get those jobs.  <br>  <br>  The Stimulus Bill is a big fat joke, costing billions to the Taxpayers.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	"LA TUYA!"......lol<br>  <br>  Check your local construction companies.

You people are really funny.<br>  when mr Blair was a PM most people dislike him, after that when mr Gordon Brown took over most of the people say he look fine and will do a good work for the country, but at the moment most of the people dislike this face due to the economy problem.If we put mr Cameron face on the PM position...i don't think his face will last long too.<br>  The economy down turn is a world economy problem.lets give the PM and<br>  his Team a little more time to turn thing around.i am sure thing will be improve shortly.The most important thing is that you too need to turn thing around for your self.Remember  improvement always start from Basic.you should know what i mean.|`|wdmJrQYPaa	I saw him on tv today giving some speech to whoever would listen and noticed he's started talking with his hands, like his old pal & foe Tony.

He is out of the same stable as Blair ... they don't know the meaning of the word truth.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Hal ... that's amusing ... are you suggesting that Gordon Brown will try to take credit for the upturn of the world economy, when in fact the upturn is inevitable as part of the usual cycle of boom and bust!<br>  <br>  Edit2: Hal: Gordon stood up in Parliament and said they had got rid of boom and bust!  So therefore his economic policies were totally hopeless, they didn't work!|`|AA12349988	Yes I do - I think if his plans work he will go down in history as the man that saved the worlds finances.<br>  <br>  He could be the FDR of his time.<br>  <br>  He does look like a slug and has no personality but his looks will not make Britain a better place.<br>  <br>  Sidous - if it inevitable that we have a boon bust cycle and Gordon cant take credit for the boom - how can YOU blame for the bust?<br>  <br>  Edit 2 - oh Sidous your the one whose mentioning boom and bust and looking to the past that no one can change - I am only interested in the here and now and the future.

AOaHaRvBaa	You may not have to go through Basic Training again, but you definitely have to go through the Warrior Transition Course.  The WTC is mostly for former Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard personnel, but they also train prior service Army who don't have to attend Basic.  You will also likely have to re-class as an 11B.  The National Guard has several 2-week 11B MOS certification courses, so I doubt you'll have to go back to Ft. Benning and get MOS-Q'd through an OSUT company.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	You would definately not have to attend basic.  As long as you served and were discharged honorably, you should be able to come back in without an issue, qualifying for a bonus (for now) and the student loan repayment.  You will most likely be able to come in at the same rank as well.  You should be good to go.
LxrsG8ifaa	I don't see how they have a case anyway. A cosigner is aware at the time of signing a loan that they are responsible for making sure the payments are made on time.

6KfIbe3Qaa	Down South Cutie, It's been a while and I hate to hear about the unemployment.<br>   On your question... You got to remember the "stuck on stupid" politics that govern us in the southern states. However, who are they kidding, the Republican Govs. are going to take the money. If they don't, then Pres. Obama will call them out. Republican Govs. think they're a nickel slick but Pres. Obama has their penny change.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	If you honestly believe that money is going to go directly into your pocket you are sadly misled on what this stimulus bill is meant to do.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	Have him check around.

God bless and good luck.|`|iDq0PuSfaa	Your Quote: "My husband worked in an oilfield that is in no way suffering because of the economy"<br>  <br>  You mean oil below $40 a barrel does not effect those who produce it?<br>  Wrong.<br>  <br>  The money they are kicking back to fed is crap money anyway.<br>  Obama is extending unemployment benefits temporarily through the porkulus. After the porkulus is gone these same states must fund these programs themselves. The only way to do that is raise taxes.When you raise taxes unemployment also shoots up with it.<br>  <br>  The states are in a catch 22 either way, which is by BOs design.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	you either work a second job or go to where the work is. it does no good to sit around and complain. and think of this, after the bail out money runs dry, and you get back on your feet, those services will still have to be paid for, with no bailout money, then your taxes go up, you ok with that? life, liberty and the PURSUIT of happiness is what you were promised.|`|RZfoszJFaa	you, and your state, will thank him when you look at your taxes.|`|jyzpX5iuaa	You should be upset with Obama and Dems for making it so hard to pull oil out of the ground.  Your hubby may still be working if the Dems hadn't been so tuff on big oil.  You know the $4 gas was speculators, but they bullied the oil companies for it.  Making them cut production and lay off your Husband.  Eventually, they will have a $2 tax on $2 gas making it $4 again, you won't be able to go to work but maybe your Husband gets his job back.<br>  <br>  In times like this if your household has a job, its better than none at all, although you would be taken care of like all the other poor, if you would just stop working, and sell your house.
K1iUzewyaa	no, most likely they will over look that. But if for some reason they did not like you, they would bring it up, ie, you aren't respectful, out of shape, cocky, etc. If it is severe, they may say something, but if it is just minor, don't think they would mention it. To answer your question further.. no, they should not disqualify you. My cousin is in the Air Force. He is pigeon toed pretty bad, and he still got in. He's a helicopter pilot...|`|TWtYdYLHaa	its supposed to be, just try to duck walk the best you can, if not, im sure they have a waiver for it, the army has a waiver for everything now, soon they'll have an asvab waiver, (army joke)

If he had a contract he could enforce it.  Otherwise, he could quit or get fired at any time.|`|DY9NOh4taa	No, most people are hired "at will" by the companies that employ them. That basically means, if you want to quit the job at any time, you can. <br>  However, the employer also has the right to terminate your employment if they feel that you are not doing the job that they hired you to do.<br>  While it is immoral, there is nothing illegal about the practice, and unless your boyfriend signed a contract with the company he has no recourse. <br>  Now if you boyfriend did not receive his last check from the employer, that is something you can do to recoup lost wages. Contact the employer and tell him if you don't have your last check by (set a date that is reasonable), that you are contacting the Wage and Hour Board, which can also give you guidelines on filing the complaint.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Neither - they wanted that other guy instead of your boyfriend.

When I went through, all females were required to carry on them at all times some feminine hygiene supplies because women's cycles can get wacky during high stress/living with lots of women times (and yes, the female drill sergeants checked us to ensure we had them--don't worry, we carried them in baggies in our pocket).  I found the OB tampons (without an applicator) to be the easiest to use because the other types, well, the apps kept getting smooshed in my pocket and would use pads for backup.  I also kept track of my cycles (they stayed regular) so I knew when to expect my "friend".|`|V7JVKApkaa	It's not that private at all. You are not the first women to go to boot-camp.

Also, call one or two utilities around and see what their policies are.  There is no underlying reason that I can think of where a lineman would have to meet a higher burden than any other employee at a utility.  The only exception would be most lineman must either have or be capable of getting a commercial driver's license.<br>  <br>  Also, a lineman is an occupation almost always in demand.

524ae26534ddf801aecd5122aa2ed234aa	This is straight from Wikipedia, but it sums it up well:<br>  <br>  It is difficult to declare the Battle of the Somme a victory for either side. The British and French captured little more than five miles (8 km) at the deepest point of penetration—well short of their original objectives. The British themselves had gained approximately only two miles and lost about 420,000 soldiers in the process, meaning that each centimetre cost the lives of two men. A group of British and Commonwealth historians have, since the 1960s, argued against the long-held consensus that the battle was a disaster; arguing that the Battle of the Somme delivered more benefits for the British than it did for the Germans. As British historian Gary Sheffield said, "The battle of the Somme was not a victory in itself, but without it the Entente would not have emerged victorious in 1918."<br>  <br>  <br>  Strategic effects:<br>  Prior to the battle, Germany had regarded Britain as a naval power and discounted her as a military force to be reckoned with, believing Germany's major enemies were France and Russia. According to some historians, starting with the Somme, Britain began to gain influence in the coalition. In recognition of the growing threat she posed, on 31 January 1917, Germany adopted the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare in an attempt to starve the island nation of supplies. Other historians would argue Britain's growing influence in the war had nothing to do with the battle and everything to do with her great financial and industrial strength, which inevitably increased in importance in a stalemate war.<br>  <br>  At the start of 1916, the British Army had been a largely inexperienced, but well trained mass of volunteers. The Somme was the first real test of this newly raised "citizen army" created following Lord Kitchener's call for recruits at the start of the war. It is accurate to observe that many British soldiers who were killed on the Somme lacked experience, but unwise to conclude, as some historians may have done, that their loss was of little military significance. These soldiers had been the first to volunteer and so were often the fittest, most enthusiastic and best educated citizen soldiers. For Germany, which had entered the war with a trained force of regulars and reservists, each casualty was sapping the experience and effectiveness of the German army. The German Army Group Commander Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria stated: "What remained of the old first-class peace-trained German infantry had been expended on the battlefield." Despite being promoted to Field-Marshal, Rupprecht infuriated the new German High Command (Hindenburg and Ludendorff) by advising them to make peace. A war of attrition was better for Britain with her population of some fifty million than Germany whose population of some seventy million also had to sustain operations against the French and Russians.<br>  <br>  Some historians hold the Battle of the Somme damaged the German Army beyond repair, after which it was never able to adequately replace casualties with the same calibre of soldier that doggedly held its ground during most of the battle, the implication being that by the end of the battle, the Allied and German armies were closer to being equally matched. However, the German Army not only maintained its line unbroken throughout, but actually drew a few divisions away from the Western Front at the height of the offensive for use in its concurrent invasion of Romania. In 1917, the Germans were still able to defend effectively against British and French attacks at Arras, Champagne (the Nivelle Offensive), and Passchendaele.<br>  <br>  On 24 February 1917, the German army made a strategic scorched earth withdrawal from the Somme battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the Hindenburg Line, thereby shortening the front line they had to occupy. The purpose of military commanders is not to test their army to destruction, and it has been suggested German commanders did not believe the army could endure continual battles of attrition like the Somme. Loss of German territory was repaid many times over in the strengthening of defensive lines, an option which was not open to the Allies because of the political impossibility of surrendering French or Belgian territory (despite Napoleon's commonsense dictum about the advantages of sacrificing ground).<br>  <br>  The strategic effects of the Battle of the Somme cannot obscure the fact it was one of the costliest battles of the First World War. A German officer, Friedrich Steinbrecher, wrote:<br>  <br>  “ Somme. The whole history of the world cannot contain a more ghastly word. ” <br>  —Friedrich Steinbrecher

I think it would be in your interest to consult with an attorney to better understand the potential issues.  It probably isn't a good idea to just randomly post legal questions on Yahoo (trust me, I had a bad experience), when many of the members don't know what they are talking about.  With such an important issue like child support, you def. need to, at the very least, contact a lawyer, even though I know they can be expensive.  When I had a legal problem, I used www.quicklegalanswer.com for my legal stuff and was surprised how fast an attorney answered my question.  It was very cheap and helped me put my mind at ease.  Anywho, just thought it would be a good idea.  If you need anything else, let me know.

You need to submit supporting docs: Copies of yours and your spouses drivers license, birth certificates, your marriage license, G 325 biographic info forms (2 copies for each of you) which you can also download at www.uscis.gov And of course a check for the fee - $355.00<br>  <br>  I 485 - Application to Adjust status (From H1B to permanent resident)  This is a form that you will fill out. You will need to send copies of your I 94 card that you got when you entered the USA, your birth certificate, copies of your passport pages, any approval notices you have from immigration if you ever extended your H1B visa, notarized affadavits from people who know you attesting to the validity of your marriage (I have blank copies if you need some) Fee: $1010.00<br>  <br>  I 864 - Affidavit of Support - Filled in by your spouse as they are going to have to swear to and be able to financially support you in the eyes of immigration. Your spouse will need to send copies of their pay stubs, recent tax returns.<br>  <br>  I 131 - Application for Travel Document - You will fill this in to get an advance parole document so that you can travel whilst your application is processing. I think you can travel on your H1B visa, but this doesn't cost anything so you may as well send off the paperwork for it. You just need to send the form and copies of your DL, Passport info page, and I 94.<br>  <br>  I 765 - Application for Employment Authorization - This will enable you to work anywhere you wish whilst your application is in processing, and again there is no fee.

AOaHaRvBaa	If you unit won't excuse you, you have to go to drill.  Your service in the Guard trumps your school.  Your college first only makes you non-deployable - it does not excuse you from training.   <br>  <br>  Check out your college/university's policy on make-up exams/excused absences.  Also double check the professor's syllabus for his policy.  I'm sure that the college/university has a policy to excuse members of the military for training.  Make sure you follow that.  If there is a conflict between the professor's policy in his syllabus and the college/university's policy, the college/university wins.<br>  <br>  Have you given something in writing from your unit to your professor?  If you have, and he still refuses, contact the dean of his college/school/department (his boss).  Explain your situation to the dean and provide documentation.  If that doesn't work, contact the dean of students.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Your unit should always have an active duty clerk, ask your section if you can work with your active duty supply or clerk on weekends or week days other then the days that yoru exams are on so you can make up thr drill days. <br>  There should be a VA rep in every college, now I don;t know if thy work for reservist but you can give it a go.

She calmed down and apologized.<br>  <br>  Tell him he has to just leave the room.|`|ucYwexwJaa	typically speaking a woman hitting on a man is a fool to begin with, but usually not life threatening as they don't have the strength or power that a man does.  Also, the man can usually restrain them until they cool down or police can be called.  As to destroying property that's why we have lawsuits, to recover damage to property and the such.  The only time a man should be hitting on a girl is if his life is in danger, ie female with knife coming at him....by all means knock that ***** out!!!! Then call the police and have her arrested.

A class c misdemeanor is equal to a traffic ticket and since it was done before you were 18; after enough time it won't show up on your records for job applications.

6Fsliwlhaa	Okay, what did he lie to you about?<br>  <br>  95% of people who claim that their recruiter lied to them made that assumption because they misheard something the recruiter told them or they had selective hearing.  For example; if the recruiter says "you will get this benefit IF you qualify and do this task first," the recruit tunes out anything after the word "benefit" and says the recruiter lied to him when they don't get the benefit.<br>  <br>  It isn't smart for a recruiter to lie to get someone in because it will tarnish his name and make it harder to get someone in.  They serve 36 months (24 if a corporal) at a recruiting station and if they get a reputation of lying to get people in then people won't want to deal with him anymore.  Also, he or she could face charges under the UCMJ if caught.  Think of it like a car dealership: if they get the reputation of lying and ripping people off then people won't go to them anymore and then they will go out of business.<br>  <br>  As for failing the ARMS test, you can't ship to basic if you can't meet weight, tape and pass the test.  So you will probably get put out of the DEP.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you wanted to go Navy then why did you talk to an Army recruiter?  Just to let you know, the same MEPS that tests Army recruits also tests Navy recruits and you might have a harder time getting in the Navy after quitting out of the Army.

If you didn't listen to them, you deserve whatever you got.  Now go to McDonalds, make sure to supersize and don't have anything to do with the Army anymore.|`|tcA1w24jaa	LOL - Sounds like you are going to have a long life of quitting on your commitments.

OK, I won't.  However, the fact that you are even discussing this with a friend is not a good sign for your mental state of being.  Your best bet would be to get rid of these photos as soon as possible so that you can move on with your life.  We all could have a moment when that type of thought crosses our mind.  However, by simply taking the time to write this our and ask the question implies that you are tending to dwell on this to much.  You've had a couple of minutes of daydreaming about this, then you've yukked it up with a friend.  Now, it is time to drop it and move on to something more productive.<br>  <br>  However, if you do post these pictures, you are prolonging the length of time that you will be responsible, or least questioned, about anything that does happen to her.  The least she could do is to start a legal case for invasion of privacy, based on what you release about her. <br>  <br>  Like almost every fantasy of revenge, it almost always seems better playing in your head than when it actually plays out in real life.
pTcyhs9Maa	I don't know about North Carolina but my best friend is a CPS worker in California so I asked her about your question.  She said that in CA a parent can file a petition in court to look over the file.  She suggested calling your local CPS office and asking if they have a 'legal liaison' who is the person who can tell you what exactly to do.  Also, if you can't get the file don't worry too much.  Just let the judge know there is a CPS history.  He or she can order a copy of the file to review.  Likely, the judge will order a continuance so he/she has time to review the file.  Good luck!|`|AA10045620	Have your attorney secure that information for you.  He can present it to the judge.
ZNe6B9TQaa	You should have reported him to your principal and urged her to press charges against him for much worse crimes than attacking him.  Attacking him was honestly the dumbest thing you could do.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't actually be as worried about the criminal charges as the civil suit to follow.  The criminal charges will be guided by the fact that you are 14 and therefore, will not be overly harsh but will probably include large fines.  The repercussions of your actions from the school will likely be severe (if this is a U.S. public school) and will likely include a period of suspension.  <br>  <br>  Once that's handled, this child's parents will likely sue you through your parents.  I imagine that the cost of the surgery is actually much more expensive than you estimated and the child may or may not have proper insurance to help cover the costs.  Orthodontics alone are well about $20,000 without insurance.  The other child's parents will prevail in a lawsuit, without a doubt, no questions asked; you and your actions were the soul cause of the damages this child incurred.  Not to mention that your parents will also be forced to pay the attorney fees of the other party on top of their own--this can sometimes be as much as $20,000, too.

Maybe even Roosevelt.<br>  Rather than listen to any words about blame, try to figure out what the actual causes are, then figure out whodunit.<br>  Remember - how can you tell a politician is lying?<br>  His lips are moving.|`|PfCga0X5aa	It's old already - the Bush Administration is STILL pointing their fingers at Clinton and now they are pointing them at Obama.<br>  <br>  It's way old and way Republican to point fingers rather than do something / anything to help working people that pay 97% of the taxes.|`|LTNLIT98aa	dems are balmegame pros--it's what they do--shift responsibility--and blame others--even when it is their feet that smell badly--they will swear----it is your feet that smell badly..funny..|`|FOf9Y9dqaa	Usually whatever the media decides to broadcast.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Well Lincoln established the idea of "the Union" (aka Federal Govt overriding state govt.) which effectively overrides the 10th amendment.<br>  <br>  This allowed for the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 ("federal" like Federal Express) which issues paper money.<br>  <br>  FDR confiscated all the gold bullion in 1933 via Executive Order 6102 and gave the people paper in exchange. (Shortly after this forced sale, the price of gold from the treasury for international transactions was raised to $35 an ounce; the U.S. government thereby devalued the U.S. dollar by 41%.)<br>  <br>  Nixon abandoned the gold standard completely. (Resulted in more inflation and a dollar with even less purchasing power)<br>  <br>  Now the whole paper financial fiction is about to collapse and people will have nothing.<br>  <br>  ........As an interesting side note, if the govt. nationalizes the banks and then the dollar collapses, then the GOVT. could start seizing assets because THEY WOULD OWN THE BANKS. (dollar bills certainly won't cover any debt in 8 months)<br>  <br>  Andrew Jackson (who hated Central Banks and paper money) actually managed to get the national debt down to about $30,000 at one point. The banking cartel (Federal Reserve), once established, thought it funny to then put his face on the most popular piece of paper money in history: the twenty dollar bill.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Bush did it for 8 years
44AkhdRnaa	Hague, now has lost the image of that ' young tory prat'.<br>  <br>  Alas to say I would vote tory if he was my MP or going for PM.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I'd like to think so but I doubt it.  He is highly intelligent and very quick witted but because a lot of people are so shallow he was previously rejected because of the sound of his voice and his bald head.|`|SmPOWbD6aa	You can't say. Because market index may rise or fall at any level at any time in the field of politics. Best policy is " Wait and See".|`|arZQTSjiaa	does it really matter, they are all the same|`|5KcUyLFRaa	I think we have.|`|AA12349988	Yes - in the same way Gordon Brown has become prime minister.  I think he is very intelligent (but not street wise - hence the baseball cap and drinking pints) but like Gordon lacks the charisma that both Tony Blair and David Cameron have.<br>  <br>  I dont think Hague could win an election before proving what he has to offer.  Which is a shame as I think he is one Tory who could actually come up with policies to challenge Labour.|`|AA11097492	Probably. Sooner or later someone will realise David Cameron is actually Scottish and start a campaign to get him out. Hague's ineffective, he's clearly a shoe-in replacement.<br>  <br>  The only thing a Conservative government will aid is the end of the Union, because Cameron has already stated that one of the first acts of a Conservative government will be to review the Barnett formula... and what that really means is cutting the budget allocated to Scotland to keep the Conservative core vote in the Home Counties happy. However, if they do this, it will be an utter godsend for the SNP, who will happily fall upon it to show the disdain Westminster has for Scotland, and by cutting the funding more and more Scottish people will wonder just why the hell we are still getting handouts from London.<br>  <br>  Roll on. Because personally I've long since realised the Union as a political entity is as good as dead.
K1iUzewyaa	No Acorn..<br>  Taxes, normal levels for all, not tax cuts. ( you can't tax business, and wealthy, to give more money to the poor, because look now everyone is getting ready for the reaming, and laying off workers)<br>  No, zero bailouts, do away with all bail outs.<br>  No more money going to feed abortion.<br>  Lower government spending all the way around. (who cares if the sod needs replaced in Washington) <br>  Quit talking down the economy to get your way. The more negative things the President says of the economy, the worse it will get.<br>  No more help for illegal aliens. If you're  in this country illegally, become a U.S. citizen, pay your taxes, the right way, quit expecting a hand out. Time limit on government assistance. Who will try harder to get ahead, if they always have their hand out?<br>  <br>  Instead of Acorn, to further Obama next term, do away with Acorn, and set up something to target illegals, educate them the proper way to become a citizen. <br>  <br>  Basically, it can't be done with these stimulus packages. We're in a deeper whole than before. These companies are failing for a reason.. government needs to keep their hands off private sector.  I hope it can be done, but it's sad because I bet he will cut a lot of military money, and that should not be done at such a time as this...|`|q1GnMRxxaa	One can not cut the deficit by spending more money.  Obama is going to raise taxes big time in order to cut the deficit. He may also cut the military like Clinton did before. NONE of this is a good thing. If I was the president, I would CUT social programs, especially to the illegals, cut taxes across the board to those who actually pay taxes and not give any raises to any politician until they prove their worth. Everyone would be held accountable for their actions including the president herself.   (yes I do watch the TV show 24, thus the remark about the president herself).|`|VuaOKpYXaa	He isn't cutting the deficit in half at all.

The USA has the highest business tax in the World.<br>  3) Nobama needs to eliminate the IRS and go to a sales based tax collection system.  The network is in place, but no one has the balls to do this.  <br>  4) They need to pull Social Security money from the general budget and put it into a savings account so our politicians do not spend the money.  Which is why Social Security is in the state it is in right now. <br>  <br>  This is a start.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	Considering the economic remedies being implemented by this administration, to say that you could be able to cut the deficit in half in the next four years is an outright lie.  It cannot happen with unbridled spending and socialistic programs.  A president suggesting this is either a bold-faced liar or the most stupid person on the planet.|`|VK0brk89aa	Obama could leave Iraq earlier than the set date of 2011. If he does he will lie and claim it saved trillions. Obama might cut our defense budget down to nothing too.<br>  <br>  Obama could raise taxes on all Classes and on all Businesses. The Middle and Lower Classes bring in tons of tax dollars so they won't be exempt although Obama will say he cut them he will lie.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a wait and see but considering he just spent w/interest over 3 Trillion Dollars he sounds like a Idiot.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	When he says cut in half does he mean half after he spent the extra 800 billion?
d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Conservatives believe in the power of the individual. Liberals believe in the power of the collective. All other points spin from these two basic concepts.|`|9d324139a59bc1e69bcfeb3145f249efaa	"Liberal" n (fm L "liberalis"="worthy of a free man, generous") One who is open minded or not strict in observance of orthodox, traditional, or established ways.<br>  "Conservative n (fm L "conservator"="one who preserves") On who tends to maintain existing views, conditions, or institutions, a traditionalist.<br>  Historically one generations "Liberal" or "Radical" views becomes the next generations "Conservative".  History also shows that a successful society is one that achieves a balance between the two rather than a dominance by either extreme.  Examples of Liberals in U.S. History would be the Founding Fathers (for a colony to establish independence had never been done, religious freedom hadn't existed in Europe for centuries nor had a society with no hereditary aristocracy), Abraham Lincoln (slavery had been a cherished institution and a way of life for centuries), Theodore Roosevelt (the first President to suggest that natural resources were not inexhaustible had to be protected), Lyndon B. Johnson (the Great Society was a major change and lead to, among other things, the legalization of inter-racial marriage in 1968).  Conservatives were the ones who opposed those things and work to undo them, like Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, and G.W. Bush.  The thing to bear in mind is that change for it's own sake is not necessarily a good thing, we need thoughtful conservatives to balance out the liberal impulsiveness.|`|AA10742996	Yes liberals believe that there is a fixed amount of wealthin the world and if the rich get richer then the poor get poorer. Which isn't the case. The rich do get richer but so does everyone else its just that zero will always be zero so the spread between rich and zero continues to grow.<br>  <br>  Conservatives realize that wealth CAN be created and continues to grow. Otherwise we would still be living in caves as no wealth would have ever been created.|`|sDO96MRqaa	Conservatives believe in keeping themselves plump and fat and passing out the crumbs to the people who actually do the work for the food. They teach their kids this same logic and make them proud that they have grown up with priviledge.  They teach them that the only reason that others don't have what they have is because they didn't work hard enough.  Forget all other real logic.|`|5QicX6O4aa	I think you have your theory backwards, sorry.<br>  <br>  Examples...friggin' flaming lils SPEND & SPEND & don't pay their taxes.

Like NO bailouts, "you made the bed, lie in it"....pun intended.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Liberals believe you should share your wealth. Conservatives are willing to share, but expect everyone to earn their way before bowing down to giveaways. (there is a difference between charity and entitlements)|`|gc16g57Iaa	Liberals think the baker can make an infinite amount of pie and that they can give it away to everybody without consequence.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	She's my cherry pie, cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise, taste so good, make an old man cry, sweet cherry pie.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Liberals believe everyone should get an equal share of the pie.  Sounds good right?  But the pie doesn't change size, only the number of slices being served.  You don't get a bigger share just because you baked more of it, you get the same as everyone.  Even if you did most of the baking or if you bought most of the supplies.  In fact, if you have enough to put so much into the pie, the government will just take more and more of your pie to support their "sharing" pie.  Leaving you to eventually have to beg them for pie and lose interest in making your own flavor of pie forever.<br>  I believe that if you can bake it, you should keep it.  Let the government pay for its own "sharing pie".  Of course, if you share a little bit, the government won't take so much of it's share from your pie.  If you are making a small pie, keep your small pie and keep buying stuff to make your small pie.  That way, the miller and the farmer can afford to make their own pies.  Then the government has fewer people to "share" with but more people who can contribute to its "sharing" pie and can make it easier for us to be able to make pies because the government is taking less pie from more bakers to support its "sharing" pie.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	No, actually it makes no sense but it would make more if you switch it, maybe.|`|AQep0wRvaa	Liberals believe that they are held back because of race, their nationality, or their social economic history.  They believe they are being held back, because of these reasons.  They blame the system. They blame the people who have everything they do not.  They believe that the government should take from this group and give it to them. They believe they are entitled to their wealth because they work for them. They lack responsibility and accountability. <br>  <br>  Conservatives believe in every person has the opportunity to succeed. The system is in placed to give you an opportunity to succeed.  They believe, all you need is work to be succeed. They also believe that what ever you make you should keep. They believe in charity but not handouts.|`|RermzbWgaa	Economically both schools of thought would basically agree that there are limited resources.  It is how those resources are distributed that differs.<br>  <br>  There is some argument at the moment about the abundance of resources....but generally, everyone agrees that they are limited (scarcity) at least at a point in time (immediately only so much is available).<br>  <br>  In actuality however I think both schools of thought (apart from theory....rather real practical application) are about power grabbing and much less to do with what is economically wise (they distribute or support distribution that benefits themselves politically without much thought to much else).|`|HLf1QYd1aa	Liberals believe that everyone deserves a handout, while Conservatives believe that you should have to work for what you get.|`|zftm6qkKaa	What???

Meaning if the men in Mexico, lets say ages 15 to 55 are up here, then whos gonna knock the women up back there.... Get it??? <br>  <br>  As far as truth is concerned:<br>  "JALPA, Mexico (Reuters) – Forty years ago, Ramiro Viramontes slept on palm frond mats on a crowded floor with his six brothers and sisters. Unable to find jobs when they grew up, most left Mexico for the United States.<br>  <br>  Mexican families sent millions of illegal workers to the United States in the late 20th century as the country's population grew faster than its ability to create jobs.<br>  <br>  But now, Mexicans are having many fewer children due to government birth-control campaigns and changing lifestyles. That is causing a deep demographic shift that could turn back the immigration tide.<br>  <br>  The average Mexican family went from having seven children in 1960 to two in 2008. Families in Mexico are now slightly smaller than Hispanic families in the United States.<br>  <br>  Viramontes, 48, an electrician, is a father of just two.<br>  <br>  "We didn't want our kids to go through what we went through. We didn't want them to be tempted to leave," said Viramontes, whose siblings are scattered from California to Massachusetts.<br>  <br>  Some 11.4 million people left Mexico between 1970 and 2006, Mexican government demographers say. Almost all went north, in probably the largest wave of immigrants ever from one country to the United States.<br>  <br>  The number of people leaving each year appears to have peaked at around 600,000 in 2001, according to researchers at the government's National Population Council, or Conapo.<br>  <br>  Fewer have left each year since then, with about 440,000 Mexicans emigrating in 2006. Researchers say the number should keep falling as Mexican population growth slows.<br>  <br>  "We have already seen the peak," said Paula Leite, head of demographic research for migration studies at Conapo.<br>  <br>  Some experts say the U.S. economic downturn and tighter policing have further stemmed the flow of illegal migrants in the last two years, and also persuaded some Mexicans already in the United States to return home.<br>  <br>  DESERT TREKS<br>  <br>  Many Mexicans crossed deserts on foot or swam across the Rio Grande to seek jobs in hotels and restaurants, on farms, and in construction. The influx profoundly changed America.<br>  <br>  Hispanics are the largest U.S. minority group with growing influence in politics and business. Nearly one in 10 people in the United States claim Mexican heritage.<br>  <br>  U.S. authorities are building a 670-mile fence along the border to stop more coming but some researchers say that kind of measure might be overkill.<br>  <br>  "It's like building a dike for a flood that might not be there," said Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.<br>  <br>  Viramontes and his wife decided to have a small family to provide more for fewer mouths. Indeed, their son went to college and then opened an Internet cafe in town.<br>  <br>  They were guided by a government birth control program launched in the 1970s that told families that having lots of children would keep them poor. Millions heeded the campaign, despite opposition from the influential Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  In Jalpa, a ranching town in central Mexico that has lost much of its population to the United States, public health clinics distributed condoms and birth control pills. Doctors also suggested women use intrauterine devices, or IUDs.<br>  <br>  "As soon as a child was born, the doctors wanted to put the device in my wife," said Viramontes.<br>  <br>  Jalpa town councilman Jesus Guerrero, 65, remembers his grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary party where nearly 100 grandchildren gathered. Guerrero himself has only three.<br>  <br>  "Small families live better," Guerrero said, echoing a government slogan that most people in Jalpa seem to have memorized.<br>  <br>  Across the developing world, birth rates fell during the late 20th century as economies grew, health care improved and women gained better access to jobs and birth control.<br>  <br>  Mexican families shrank faster than most. Annual population growth fell from 3.35 percent in 1960 to less than 1 percent in 2008. Smaller numbers are entering the workforce every year.<br>  <br>  GOOD JOBS<br>  <br>  Still, no matter how small Mexican families get, some workers will still cross the border to seek higher U.S. salaries. Mexico's minimum wage is less than $4 a day compared to the U.S. federal minimum wage of $6.55 an hour.<br>  <br>  "The demographic change will mean less pressure on people to leave but they're still going to need good jobs in Mexico," said Philip Martin, a professor specializing in immigration, farm labor and economic development at the University of California, Davis.<br>  <br>  Any decline in immigration from Mexico will be slow because leaving for America is so customary in towns like Jalpa that many teenagers hardly look for work before shipping out.<br>  <br>  Nearly everyone has kin in the United States, mak

BUT he can smoke and make us pay for it.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming they're for him because I seem to recall he smoked Kools. Now there's a stereotype he doesn't seem ashamed of. Maybe he should switch to Marlboro Reds in the box. Naw - then he'd think he was out of touch with the people. Funny, I don't know anyone who smokes Kools - I know very few people who even smoke anymore - but those who did, myself included, smoked regular cigarettes - not hyped up Menthols.<br>  <br>  If this guy is so smart as to think he can legislate our behavior and morality (which he's already doing) how the hell does he continue to smoke?

AA10126668	In my personal opinion I would have to say the Government. But we are fortunate to live in a country where you can choose what is best for your children. If You enough money. If not your children can still get the best free education from the Government.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Most studies and ACT/SAT scoring reflects the Home Schooling and private schools (religious or business ran both) beat public education by a fairly wide margin.  Funding might play a part but some privately operated schools in poor areas do well and most serious studies of it say the two things that really are the most important are the motivation of the child to learn (parental involvement) and keeping discipline in the class room.  The kid who wants to earn in public school is hurt by the children who disrupt the classroom and take up too much time and really has no desire to learn or better themselves.  Throwing money at education, worrying about hurting self esteem so make grading noncompetitive, don't use red pens to mark wrong answers (yes a teachers union thing in their recommendations on improving schools to make sure children don't get a negative view of themselves), and changing curriculum to ensure kids pass or teaching the test does not work.  My daughter in college said that they are redoing a class she took and just made a B in because twenty percent of the students make a below a "C" so it is too difficult.  Using a five grade scales shouldn't the majority make a "C" with declining percentages both ways?  It seems the goal, as explained to her by the professor, is at least 75% should make an "A" or "B" and no one actually fail.  Are we teaching or just trying to make the school and teachers look good?  In high school they skipped chapters of history because it wasn't on the test so rather then teach many teachers teach the test-reason makes the school look good and if they perform "exceptionally on the testing" the teachers get bonuses and bigger raises.|`|hMLmrPbgaa	Doesn't matter -- any of those institutions are more than able to break young peoples' spirits.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	I would say your parents|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Parents. Homeschooling is the only way to ensure you children are properly educated.|`|ipWRgKetaa	By the community. There's nothing that a government, a corporation or a church can do if the community is virtually 'anti-education'. I've lived in the inner city and have seen the community attitudes toward education. The schools aren't bad because the teachers, resources or funds are lacking, they're bad because in these communities education is not valued. In fact, if you are seen as someone seeking an education or excelling in education you are looked down on and harassed. Even parents often do not abide a child who is excelling beyond their level of 'achievement'. And that is even if the parent is even paying attention which, in most cases, they are not. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, we could double the already significant level of funds and resources going to our schools and still not improve the level of education in these communities. The provider is pretty irrelevant. If we give vouchers or have some 'corporation' or church organization provide an alternative, the level of achievement there does not increase because of the 'resource', but because those who attend these schools value education.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	They each have advantages.<br>  <br>  Corporation - I have been is several corporately-run schools. They had brilliant equipment and good staff. However, the administrators thought of the children as profit-making units. Any unprofitable part of the education was dropped, so no field-trips, for example.<br>  <br>  Government - Ensures everyone gets an education, but doesn't innovate.<br>  <br>  Church - Usually a decent education, but does tend to force religious views on the kids.|`|3UTlASavaa	The stunning thing is that each person who suggested that the best education would come from your parents are being thumbed down like crazy.  Is our only role as parents to pay for and feed our kids and to hand them off like sponges to be taught the doctrine of the government, a corporation or the church?  The only way that such a position would be possible is if there was a widespread belief that parents are too stupid to do anything.<br>  <br>  Whatever happened to personal responsibility?  At least one person took a shot at suggesting that the kids have a responsibility in this.  Let's face it, any of the alternatives suggested by the question will fail if the home life does not support the idea that learning is the child's job and that, during their childhood they do have responsibilities.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Definitely not the government. The schools have been taken over by the left wing liberal Democrats and they have lowered the standards so every kid can graduate. I would say a corporation would be best.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	It is up to the STUDENT to learn - not the responsibility for anyone to teach them...........

So they think the only reason to not adore someone who they view as the new messiah would be bigotry.<br>  <br>  Some people see bigotry everywhere.  A local black  council member here (John Wiley Price) raised a stink when a white council member  called the office a "black hole."

His example was "angel food cake" & "Devil's Food Cake.)<br>  <br>  Some people assume all Republicans are bigots anyway.

It's meant the same way as calling either of them puppets. Someone else is pulling the strings and getting them (training them) to do what they want. <br>  <br>  The Democratic politicians put Obama in office because they figured that they could get him to do whatever they want him to. It's not about race, it's about power. Who is really in power right now, the President or the Democratic houses? It sure isn't "We the People".|`|148b310a495e7b39f22ec12f33bcfa61aa	In this politically correct world, only whites can be insulted w/o being called a racist.|`|pNgsP3sLaa	Well, yes, if you call Obama a chimp, you're also labeled as a racist. o.o Don't you know anything?

Clinton couldn't even SPELL the word!|`|RkVZw7Qgaa	I doubt seriously anyone has the integrity to answer this question properly without bias or emotion.  <br>  <br>  And as such the question is incomplete.  Integrity with respect to what? <br>  <br>  We often confuse "stubborn stupidity" for "integrity."  Did G.W. Bush have integrity?  If so, why? Same question, different person, same problem.  An argument against G.W. Bush runs something like this: he was against "nation building" before he was for it (i.e. in Iraq).  He allowed his advisers to build up a monumental case for war without evidence.  He appointed lobbyists and special interest high-priests to key positions of the government (i.e. the EPA, FCC, DOD, DOE, etc). <br>  <br>  The mythical Lucifer (Satan) had "integrity."  This doesn't bode well for any ethical evaluation on such criterion.  Integrity is simply being true to oneself.  Clinton may have failed in this on many levels, but the results of his "integrity" or lack thereof were monumentally beneficial for our country, in comparison to his predecessor and G.W. Bush.   While G.W. Bush probably gets higher marks for "integrity" (read: stubborn attitude and sheer stupidity), while reducing our country to shambles in the 8 years of his two terms. <br>  <br>  The problem of course resides in our own confusion of different levels of action.  A catholic bishop or priest may have a tremendous amount of integrity (i.e. they admit when they are wrong, confess their sins, etc), while continuing their transgression against minors.  <br>  <br>  Integrity is simply not the right question to ask.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	No, because although his scandal was part of his personal life and people think that should be his own business---it's not when you decided to take on the role of representing the people of a whole country, your held to a different standard.

Not government employees that produce nothing or companies working for the government producing nothing or things that are not wanted in the market. I want to make this very clear because most people think that a real worker and a government worker are contributing equally by paying taxes. It's not true. A government worker paying taxes is actually passing money from one pocket to the other.<br>  <br>  It looks reasonable when the government talks about money. But it's not money, it's wealth. Wealth has to be produced and only those producing in the real market can do that. Money is just an illusion representing wealth. The government can create a greater illusion by printing money but the amount of wealth is the same. The only way to increase wealth is to produce more wealth. Wealth is real, factual, tangible. You can distort the perceptions (money) but not the physical reality (wealth).<br>  <br>  Financing is just a way not to take your wealth now. It doesn't matter, your wealth is going to be taken in the future to pay the financing. Yours or your children's or their children's. <br>  <br>  The worst part of the plan is that it doesn't create wealth nor the incentives to create wealth. People getting money for nothing won't feel compelled to improve or increase production. Workers in the real market have to do that all day every day or they don't get rewarded. The need to get paid for labor is what keep the real workers working. You can add to that professional interest, scientific curiosity, the need to keep doing something, whatever. But the main reason why a worker keeps working is the need to get what he needs to survive and support his family. Those who can do that without working don't have that basic need. You have to ask yourself why the social security system has been growing non stop since its creation. That's the reason. People without incentives to work don't. People on the border between minimum wage and welfare, fall into welfare because it's easier than working harder and improving themselves. And nobody wants to get out of the system even if the life is poor and limited. The gap from surviving doing nothing to the kind of hard work required to get a comfortable modern urban life gets wider each day. Not only they don't have an incentive to work, they get discouraged by that gap.<br>  <br>  The plan is going to increase the problem that it's trying to solve.<br>  <br>  From another point of view, the plan takes wealth out of the market just to spread it back again. Does it makes sense? Even assuming that the government is 100% efficient.<br>  And it's not. Most of that wealth is going to be wasted during the process. Just take a look at the size of the government, the cost of the government. Visit any government bureaucracy office and see how efficient they are. The cost of the plan is going to be huge.<br>  And you have to add to this how wealth is going to be distributed. The government is going to pick and choose what they think is more convenient. Even if we believe that the government is not going to consider political allegiances, who's going to assure that they're doing the right choice?<br>  In the real market those who produce what the market wants and are effective and efficient doing it, get rewarded. The government rewards those who have proved that are not productive, efficient or effective. Projects that fail miserably are fixed by throwing more money at them, it happens all the time. Why not let the market spread the wealth by balancing itself? Why let the government tip the balance (again) to the wrong side?|`|WyNOAZb9aa	Before, Bush conspired with a Tax and Spend congress.<br>  Now we have to contend with a Spend and Tax Obama.<br>  The money will come from the aprox. $1800 tax increase<br>  on each and every taxpayer, on top of the burden the Bush<br>  + Democrat congress left us.<br>  (Well, that is assuming the current administration is going to balance the budget, but it doesn't look like they are planning on facing THAT ISSUE)|`|azvsCKfCaa	Don"t worry,,, Obama will have more money printed until the dollar is worthless...

Europe should only be seen as a continent, not a group of people with a shared interest. Europe has for ages since the beginning of whenever been the center of conflict of interests. The groups of people who reside there vary so much that they could be regarded as differnt cultures and possibly races. The merging of such differences would be impossible for many different ways. First of all, i really doubt all of how many hundred (or much less) european states are willing to give up their soverignty for one unified state, and the many different cultures would clash with each other on so many issues this "unified" state would face many problems. Many cultures or distinct groups of people in europe are openly against each other as well, which would put a large amount of strain on the government.

To put it into context, I'm pretty sure the stock market i's the worst  it's ever been since the Great Depression. If Obama was so good and people had so much faith in him, then things would be good or at least climbing.  But it was only certain people that want to get life "spoon fed" (via the government), and people who are uneducated that supported him.  The people with all the money are the ones who make the "world stock market" turn.  Consequently (having a SUPER-LIB) in office -- taxing the rich up the wazzoo is not helping the matter at all, because people are already scared, so like anyone would they are going to fend for themselves by pulling their money out of the stock market causing the drop.

C5JxA8k0aa	The communist ideal sounds nice, everybody sharing everything, and living in an egalitarian, classless utopia. This vision has haunted the imagination of humanity down through the ages, and was used to form a set of principles by Karl Marx; which became the basis of the communist political doctrine. However I have always been deeply apprehensive in regards to communism as a political doctrine, as in practise there has never been a communist country, which represents the utopia dreamed up by Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky etc. For a number of complex reasons, which would take too long to explain; a planned economic system does not work as well as a market economy. <br>  No communist country has ever attained western levels of prosperity. And in a social sense; it always turns out to be very oppressive, as the state has the mandate to oppress the will of the people, by banning certain books, deciding what to put on the telly, persecuting people who display what it might consider deviant behaviour etc. And it can tell people how many children they can have, ban their religion, and potentially oppress them in every conceivable way,by imposing what it believes to be right on society, (which is a matter of opinion) as it has supreme authority over its citizens. <br>  As a result of the system favouring the rise of ruthless power hungry people, And because the people, who have this power in a communist state, like all people are driven by a number of forces besides a selfless belief in the brotherhood of man. They always to some degree end up asserting their power in an oppressive and sometimes atrocious way. Like the characters O Brian in the novel 1984 or Nurse Ratchet in the story one flew over the cuckoos nest. For these reasons communism has often been source of oppression and human misery, throughout history which is attested by the source below:<br>  <br>  “In sum the communist probably have murdered something like 110,000,000, or near two-thirds of all those killed by all governments, quasi-governments, and guerrillas from 1900 to 1987. Of course, the world totals itself it shocking. It is several times the 38,000,000 battle-dead that have been killed in all this century's international and domestic wars. Yet the probable number of murders by the Soviet Union alone--one communist country-- well surpasses this cost of war. And those murders of communist China almost equal it."<br>  <br>  Communism is the ideology of either often well meaning, but idealistic fools which discount the nature of people, society and various social and economic forces, or power hungry autocrats. I find it quite disconcerting the degree to which this ideology has influenced the minds of many in the labour party, and their favourite think tanks which formulate government policy. Many representatives of the labour government are unrepentant Marxists, and occasionally use quotations from famous communist figures such as Lennon, Marx etc. Conversely In an economic sense new labour is arguably more right wing than the Tories, and is indeed a champion of global capitalism.<br>   A far cry from old Labour which believed that private enterprise should only compliment a largely state run economy. However in a social sense they are increasingly authoritarian, and are into social engineering in a big way. They have curbed many of our civil liberties, turned political correctness into a religion, and seem obsessed with moulding society and public opinion via the legislative system, and various institutions in line with their own party political doctrine. Rather than listening to the people who they are supposed to represent. <br>  I agree that communism is as reprehensible as Fascism. And it concerns me the extent to which this ideology has influenced the labour party, as it has led them to exceed their democratic mandate to a greater extent than any previous government. In the pursuit of imposing what they believe to be right on society-which is a matter of opinion .Rather than carrying out the will of the people who they supposed to represent, which is the role of a government in a democracy.<br>  <br>  PS Wolfie Lenin died in 1924|`|QqxrVVnlaa	Race Bannon has got it right. The Russian Revolution was defeated by 1923 when Lenin died. Most of the Bolsheviks had been killed in WWI and then in the civil war with the White Russians who, incidentally, were supported by 14 national army's that included UK.<br>  <br>  Stalin was a tyrannical opportunist who seized control of a country in disarray and ruled viciously. He murdered what was left of the Bolsheviks, including Trotsky, and presided over a state capitalist regime and called it communism.<br>  <br>  While it's true that ordinary CP members were honestly committed the cause, it is still quite shameful that they went out of their way to defend the USSR. Particularly since they invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. They forgot that 'one country that oppresses another cannot itself be free'. It wasn't until 1989, when the Berlin Wall came down, that the CPGB shifted toward a more Trotskyist analysis. They also agreed that the SWP had been right all along!<br>  <br>  Nazism, on the other hand, is the politics of hate and fear and bears no comparison to the ideas of communism and socialism!|`|vl0HWTDJaa	How are communists 'just as bad as nazis'? The problem with your logic is the kind of communism loved by UK students is the idealistic variety, so people supporting it are in no way idolising countries which have used a communist model in immoral ways, they're just idolising the concept of a perfect communist society.

ITF52tu9aa	If you are generalizing about 'liberals' based on who you find on this site- there are huge generalizations by both sides. <br>  <br>  Lots of baiting and trolling. If I were making assumptions about the real world based on YA, I would definitely ask your question just as I would also ask Why are so many Conservatives racist?<br>  <br>  This site does not mirror reality. <br>  <br>  If you are talking about the offline world, I think hate radio has fanned the flames of racist generalizations. I would also venture that too many Conservatives don't want to hear experiences or world views that differ from theirs. When trying to silence voices saying we've had this experience because we've been treated differently, conservatives are often branded as racists. <br>  <br>  This doesn't mean they are, some are, some aren't. But fingers in ears about racism is a form of hidden racism and definitely condones racism (Because it wants to pretend this doesn't exist). Therein lies the problem. <br>  <br>  The 'race card' is also a bit of a racist term- belittling people trying to voice their feelings of discrimination. While some people use this to their own ends- there is still racism in America (we could look at jail sentencing time- whites versus minorities). <br>  <br>  Every time a person points to racism- it's deemed playing the race card (I think of yellow/red cards in soccer). Yet how often do we turn our heads at when we experience racism? What do we call this?

This makes it difficult to answer the question seriously.  My first instinct, however, is to generally remind you that an incredible amount of factors go into the market and that it took several years to get this low.  It will take several years to make steady gains and Obama is most definitely not the only person responsible for this.  Just as Bush is most definitely not the only person responsible for this recession.  Time, consumer attitudes, trading decisions, supply, banks, accumulated debt, fear, globalization and many other elements will factor in to the general ebb-and-flow that you observe.  <br>  <br>  I must also add that to claim that "Obama is so great and all his plans are so fantastic" is extremely vague and banal.  Also, remember he's been in office for LESS THAN two months. You seem to be placing a lot of blame on the shoulders of a single person who has been in office for less than two months. The success of the market is hardly the sole responsibility of the President and to expect improvement within two months wholly absurd.

AA11494150	If you are going to claim it was a misunderstanding, then it must be reasonable. If you can convince the judge any other person would have done the same thing, you have a chance. If the officer convinces the judge his orders were clear, your chances are slim. <br>  <br>  Ignore any comments about the officer not showing up for court, or having a minor error on the ticket. Officers do regularly show up, and minor errors can be amended. These gimmicks rarely work.<br>  .|`|oFcrglxzaa	plead not guilty and if the cop doesn't show up for court, you win, if he does, explain to the situation to the  judge and maybe you will get a break|`|qwaWd14vaa	Yes.<br>  Under the above scenario, I would say that it was a misunderstanding, about what was said, what was perceived by you and the action you took to leave as directed by the officer?<br>  A traffic control device would have said:<br>  "HALT, LOT IS FULL, NO ENTRY."<br>  The officer told you to turn around and come back later.<br>  The ambiguity, is with the wording " turn around."<br>  The meaning of how far, is needed to turn around, or at what point ahead to turn around, since NOW was not a given?|`|CPWrxvE5aa	Yes I fight every ticket..you never know the Cop might not show up for the hearing or there might be a technicality on the ticket that you can use Ex. the cop put the wrong color of the car on the ticket or something..fight it anyway..what do you have to lose....|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	Maybe the court would consider your misunderstanding with the officer, however, the fact that you didn't listen to the officer when he/she told you to turn around...was a violation!|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	You can always try - the worst that can happen is that you have to pay the full amount|`|e02fc0316a2b0411c28fe05959f2d386aa	It often is worth fighting.  For one thing I'd look up the definition of traffic control device.  I'd be surprised if a cop actually qualifies.  The technical fact of the wrong charge being written up (after all, you are supposed to obey a cops orders, too) might be enough to get you off.<br>  You ought to be able to find the information you need on your states government website.  Try the state police part of the site, I know ours has the complete traffic code posted.|`|SVvsRuwGaa	it can be sometimes.|`|yKJIN2SZaa	This sounds like the officer did not understand the law and did not properly charge you. It is not uncommon for a police officer to not understand the law or misinterpret it. Many states have statutes against disobeying a lawful order of a police officer. This may be the offense the officer meant to charge you with. It would be necessary for the prosecutor to prove the order the police officer gave you was lawful. <br>  <br>  As for failing to obey a traffic control device, it is not likely a judge will convict you of it. The prosecutor will have to prove his case first. At first blush, this one would likely get a "you have got to be kidding" from the judge to the prosecutor and officer. Judges are normally fair people and can tell when a police officer is fabricating something to fit. Based on what you said you did noting illegal and the officer abused his power by making up a charge that may fit with some stretching. You should fight it.

Contact in person would likely never happen, unless it was in some secluded place in another country far away from where the person's original life was. It would have to involve illegal activities, such as the stealing of the friend's and family members' mail and illegal recording of their phone calls. And if the witness plays by the rules, these things would be a waste of time.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	People under witness protection are not supposed to be found.

AA10118655	You need to go to court to get emancipated. And, typically, you will need your parent's consent (which you have), and be able to show you are financially capable of supporting yourself with no financial help from anyone.<br>  <br>  What might be easier is just to have your sister become your legal guardian. Then she can make legal decisions on your behalf like your parents can now. Talk to a lawyer that specializes in family law in your area to find out how to go about this.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	Why do you need to be emancipated? <br>  <br>  Your parents agrees that you are allowed to live with your sister.. so whats the purpose of emancipation?

Living with your sister means that your parents are allowing her to be your guardian, but that does not make you a legal adult. Your parents still have authority, or your sister has authority (by their consent). <br>  Being emancipated means being declared a legal adult, who can support themselves, including finishing school, etc. If you live with your sister, she is supporting you. Thus, it isn't emancipation. Parents don't sign for emancipation.. a court has to do so, and it must be shown that you are FULLY capable to handle your own decisions and support.|`|PddGC0lYaa	The only way to get emancipated is to prove that you can financially and legally support yourself.

But if my husband or i ever had a choice, we wouldnt do it, especially during his/her first couple years. This is when they grow the most and form their personality. Most parents don;t want to miss this, nor should they if they have the choice. It is extremely hard on the spouse when their husband or wife is on deployment, especially considering the fact that you have a mental condition.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Well if his daddy is a wealthy politician then he will wind up President of the United States. Otherwise it's considered desertion.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	The National Guard is different than the Active Army.  If he signed up for the Active Army he would be in the DEP right now and can drop out anytime prior to him shipping for basic.<br>  <br>  Since he is in the National Guard he already belongs to the unit he is going to and has to apply for a release.  If he isn't granted the release and refuses to ship to basic then he is considered AWOL.  Your mental condition doesn't mean anything because in the eyes of the military fiancees don't exist even if you are the mother of his child.<br>  <br>  Before you try to get out of this, consider this: whatever health conditions you have can be covered by the military if you get married to him.  I would suggest both you and your fiance consider talking to the recruiter so he can tell the both of you at the same time what benefits he will get from being in the National Guard.  Personally I would steer him to active duty since there is more pay and benefits but it isn't for everybody.  The idea that he could die in the National Guard shouldn't be the sole reason he should try and quit.  I can pretty much promise you that more people died in your state, if not your hometown, in car accidents than in combat in Iraq last month.  Also, NG doesn't deploy as much as active duty (although they can still deploy).<br>  <br>  EDIT: I see by your additional information that you are worried about him getting killed because he is going to be an 88M (the truck driving job).  Here is where you start falling apart: You insult us and assume that we don't know anything about your situation because of your kid and the fact that your fiancee could die.  The fact is that the majority of us have already been where you think you are going, as in me personally going to Iraq three times while leaving a wife and child behind for two of them.  You say that the majority of them never make it home.  Out of over 1 million troops who rotated through Iraq since 2003 about 4,000 of them paid the ultimate price, leaving a lot of troops who made it back alive.  So 4,000 doesn't fit into a majority.<br>  <br>  Insulting us won't change anything, he signed a contract and the military isn't going to want to hear your sob story about yor fiancee (not husband, which is why your mental condition isn't even a factor right now) leaving behind his son for basic, AIT, and possibly a deployment that he may or may not go on.  Millions of other troops had to leave spouses, girlfriends, boyfriends, and children to fight in combat before we were even born.  What makes you any more special that he should be exempt?  If he had a problem with it then he shouldn't have joined.  The fact is that he did and now both you and him have to deal with it.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I found this answer to a previously asked question.<br>  <br>  Reserve and National Guard Enlistments<br>  <br>  The Reserves and the National Guard do not have a Delayed Enlistment Program. The very second you take the oath, and sign the enlistment contract, you are in the Reserves (or Guard), you are assigned to a specific manpower slot in a specific unit, and you are entitled to receive pay for weekend drills (in the active duty DEP, there is no entitlement to pay), even if you have not been to basic training, and/or job-training school.<br>  <br>  This means, if you change you mind, the discharge process is entirely out of the hands of the recruiting command, and lies in the hands of the commanding officer of the Reserve or National Guard unit you are assigned to. This makes the discharge process much more complicated. An active duty DEP-discharge is relatively simple, handled by the recruiting command, and requires little paperwork. A discharge from the Reserves or National Guard requires a full-blown discharge package initiated by the unit commander for the unit you're assigned to, even if you've not been to basic training, nor attended any paid drills.<br>  <br>  Your first step should be to make a request for discharge, in writing, addressed to your commanding officer. Your letter should clearly state your reason(s) for discharge. If you don't know who your commanding officer is, your recruiter should be able to put you in touch with him/her, or provide a phone number or address.<br>  <br>  Your commander will consider your request, and either approve it (by initiating discharge action), or disapprove it. Keep in mind that the commander does not have to approve your voluntary discharge request.<br>  <br>  So, what happens if your commander disapproves your discharge request? You then have two options: (1) You can report to ship out to basic training on the date indicated on your enlistment contract, or orders, or (2) you can simply refuse to ship out to basic training.<br>  <br>  If you refuse to ship out for basic training, this ties the commander's hands. Under current regulations, the only option the commander has is to process you for discharge. Under current regulations, this is the commander's only option, so if anyone tells you (including the commander) that you will go to jail, or be court-martialed, or anything else (other than a discharge), they are lying to you. You can safely ignore such threats.<br>  <br>  The discharge must be characterized as an "Entry Level Separation," for "Performance and Conduct." An Entry Level Separation is not characterized. That means it's not "honorable," it's not "general," and it's not "Other than Honorable." It has no characterization at all.<br>  <br>  So, how is this different from an active duty DEP Discharge (other than it's more complicated)? Well, an active duty discharge from the DEP is not really a "discharge," because it creates no military record.<br>  <br>  Recall that I said a person discharged from the active duty DEP can legally and morally state on any form that he/she has not served in the military. However, members of the Guard and Reserve, are entitled to drill pay, even if they haven't been to basic training, which means they were *IN* the military, and a military record is created, and filed at the National Military Personnel Records Center, in St. Louis.<br>  <br>  That means, if you are ever asked if you have ever served in the military, you must (legally and morally) answer yes. This could possible affect future employment opportunities (some employers may put great weight on whether or not you "quit" the military, and other employers may not care, at all). It will also definately affect your eligibility to join any branch of the military in the future.<br>  <br>  You can see the entire blog at:<br>  <a href="http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/837191012/m/1780085441001" rel="nofollow">http://forums.military.com/eve/forums/a/...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know how accurate the information is but sounds about right to me.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Has your fiance signed the dotted line? Has he done the oath? If not, he probably is not in the Army yet. If he hasn't done those things have him talk to his recruiter and tell him that he changed his mind. The recruiter will be mad, but they get over it. I sure hope that I am never selected to do Recruiting, that job sounds awful.<br>  ** I was a truck driver in Iraq, and the majority of us DID MAKE IT HOME.**|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I don't even know what to say.  I can't think of anything satisfactorily witty.  Just get out of the Guard.  I'm sure your husband would just drag down his unit whining and crying about how bad he's got it because no one else has ever had a hard life before.|`|0dJMn9nTaa	very good question.<br>  <br>  the problem is that when you sign a military contract there is no way to un-do it. hes going to have to go if he avoids his deployment day he could be charged and end up in jail. now i dont know if this would work but if you can get a letter from couple doctors saying you CAN NOT take care of the kid alone and there is no one else that can around then he has a fighting chance, but if you have family near by or close family friends they will tell you that they should help you out. sorry and best of luck to you|`|cgbNGef5aa	So in other words you two got into a fight and he joined the service now that you made up he doesn't want to go? Oh well<br>  <br>  If he does not go he will go to Military jail - not a country club jail! He wont be with you to help either way and his life will be ruined. Go and serve send money home to hire someone to help you.  He will come home after boot camp and between training etc.  Just because he joined doesn't mean he will die we still have guys in the US to protect us and in almost every other country in the world. <br>  <br>  Do what is right and be a man.|`|dLd7usmGaa	I just have to state that this guy "ghost of all craiggers" is a real f'in a*hole. he commented me rudely and you. who does he think he is? and along with the Other idiots. <br>  <br>  my boyfriend is in the army. i feel for you. having a young child is hard, especially over seas. i don't have an answer to this question but i just wanted to say i feel for you, and your husband is not a coward for backing out. family first, that's how it is. i hope it all works out. don't listen to these ignorant f'in jerks on here.  i mean seriously, look at their levels, like level 7. they obviously have no time on their hands but to sit here, be rude and answer questions because they hate their lives.. don't worry sweetie. STAY STRONG, xoxo = )<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|tcA1w24jaa	Excuses are like a*sholes - everyone's got one.<br>  <br>  He's probably only enlisted in the DEP, which means...nothing. Unless he's signed his actual enlistment papers, then you can just tell the recruiter you're not going to be enlisting anymore. If you have, than you're SOL: Welcome to the military - I suggest you do some quick toughening up, both you and your husband.<br>  <br>  "We like living here in the US...but not really wanting to go die for it"<br>  <br>  Don't worry, there's plenty of us who aren't cowards who will gladly pay the price for all the freedoms you enjoy.<br>  <br>  FAIL<br>  <br>  EDIT - Oh, I see you added additional details, well then I need to change my response...<br>  <br>  DON'T YOU RAISE YOUR GODDAMIT VOICE AT ME.<br>  <br>  You don't think everyone in the military makes insane sacrafices too? You don't think I didn't miss seeing my own son being born because I was overseas? YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE? YOU THINK YOU'RE SO GODDAMN SPECIAL?<br>  <br>  I don't give two flying fcuks if you don't think he has good chances of making it back or not - if he is such a goddamit coward, than he shouldn't have joined the fcuking military.<br>  <br>  You think he's the only one with 'Mental Conditions'? News flash, cupcake, half the goddamn military probably has a 'Mental Condition.'<br>  <br>  Keep in mind who you are talking to here, we're not your buddies, we're not igorant little civilians (For the most part). We're veterans and active servicemembers - you think you're going to get any sympathy from us? We're the ones who had the balls to risk everything we had so that our families, AND YOURS, could have a better life.<br>  <br>  You're mother fcuking welcome.

AA11752525	Dear Gina,<br>  <br>                My condolences to your the passing of your Nan. As you approach my age you may come to realize this loss to be truly greater than any potential financial gain.<br>  <br>                Before anyone starts spending or borrowing against their rights to the property, I suggest an examonation of the title be explored. If the property was held as a joint tenancy or tenancy in common with rights of survivorship, your Aunt is entitled to 100% of the property. Other non-testimentary documents might exist to establish your Aunt's rights to an estate for life in the property which establishes that you are premature in seeking to see its transfer.<br>  <br>                Rx-  Wait a few days or weeks. Find out if the estate will be probated. Assuming your Nan's estate is going to be probated you can contact the attorney retained to probate the estate and obtain the answers to your questions.<br>  <br>               Good Luck.  <br>  <br>                 The rights to decedents real property is peculiar to each individual state.|`|RjUhISEIaa	You don't tell us where you are so a definitive answer is not going to be able to be given. Please update your post so those in the know can post properly.<br>  <br>  Thanks.|`|1KGXts5Daa	Without a location, I can just give you some general information (US).<br>  <br>  Your Nan died intestate, meaning she died without a will.  Therefore, the probate process is going to be a long one.  <br>  <br>  Wills must be probated and that process often takes a year or more.  Without a will and with an estate of moderate size and complexity, probate may take 2-3 years.<br>  <br>  As for line of succession, you may or may not be correct in your assumption (you would not be correct if you were in California).<br>  <br>  Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to get it figured out.|`|x2cKYj10aa	This will have to go through probate (UK) and you may be right, but it is unlikely that any decision will be made that causes one party to become homeless. This will need to be decided by due process.|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	It will have to go through probate as she has died intestate (no will). You are right in the way you have divided the it up due to your dad dying.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	If it is going to render your aunt homeless, I think she should keep it until she passes on.|`|PddGC0lYaa	Complicated situation, I may be wrong but it was to my knowledge if someone passes away without a will (however this may be with no children/family members to inherit,) it gets seized by the government. Again, that may be only if there's no one to inherit, or not. Not sure. Just my 2 cents.|`|6UWFGdy3aa	Depending on where you live that sounds right. but dont get caught up in dividing property, ruined many relationships in my family and there was a will. This kind of stuff is better to be left until you are nolonger grievng.|`|e93d483d323b7ea0e774d586db75f7d8aa	You are mistaken.  There was a joint mortgage.  Its all your Auntie's.  Because she half owned it and is still alive.  The Uncle has no claim to it unless your Auntie decides otherwise.
AA11494150	There is no "typical" sentence, that is determined by several factors.<br>  <br>  They take into consideration not only the circumstances of the incident, but his past record and input from the vitim's family. Because of the amount of discretion given to judges and prosecutors, you can not predict a sentence.|`|PddGC0lYaa	At 18 you're legally intoxicated at 0.01 .<br>  <br>  Here in California, now a days, it can be First Degree Murder if you kill someone in an accident under the influence of alcohol or drugs.<br>  <br>  Vehicular Manslaughter sentencing varies by state, usually 15-30 years, check the laws in your state for such.<br>  <br>  I don't think he is going to get off easy, and personally I do not believe he should. DUI is one of the most serious offenses someone can commit.
bkav003oaa	No, they are not comparable. <br>  <br>  If you remember Bush broke that promise during his term in office.|`|Alkn6IJYaa	No, it was 'Read my lips, no new Taxis'. There was a translation error.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Whether anyone wants to admit it or not this mess was not Obama's making. It was deregulation and the unrelenting demand that the tax base be totally eroded in the first place by Republicans that put states and cities in the horrendous messes they're in today. If taxes are raised its because it was forced to happen by your tin hat hero's like Bush and his cronies and the same ilk who walked out of the senate to sit on boards of Swiss banks. Connect the dots, but you never think that far ahead.|`|zt4GmLDBaa	Obama always says.. at least  five times, in any speech he makes..."I want to make  myself very clear".. which is pretty funny since anything he says is not clear at all.. and if you wait 24 hours he will likely change it.<br>  <br>  This is a man we should not trust.. he is like a little boy playing daddy.. doesn't have a damn clue what he is doing.,. but by gum.. he is not taking any advice either..'cause he's the king of the mountain.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Many are realizing that he has nothing more to offer than BS and words.  So yes, his having said that will come back to haunt him.|`|eDAg5OnTaa	thyat was from the first Bush, right? I was really young.|`|WyNOAZb9aa	No!  <br>  Not At All!<br>  Obama promised to redistribute the wealth.  It is not his fault that the zombies didn't realize this meant "Rob from the Taxpayers and give to the sycophants".   On the rare occasion that the teleprompter had him say something concrete, he told everyone what he was going to do... Make everyone in the coal industry unemployed.  Raise Taxes.  Implement Gun Control.  Raise Taxes. Spend Money. Increase the size of the Federal Government. Raise Taxes. Censor out any media that did not agree with him. Change the constitution so that it says what the Government can Do To You.  Make health care a "right" instead of a responsibility. Get the troops to stop fighting his Muslim brothers.<br>  Change America from what it is to an Obamanation. <br>  <br>  And he is doing exactly what he said he would do against America.|`|Agr8vAxbaa	you are so ignorant - he's been in office one month and already achieved more than any previous president did in one month.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Estimates vary, but the latest research gives a number around 3000 of all branches (infantry, engineers, artillery, cavalry). On the Texian side, some documents/memoirs found only about 10yrs ago give a rough total of 220-250.  Probably should also mention that they all didn't die: about 70 tried to get over the wall and down to the brush in the river bed.  They were cut down by Mexican cavalry stationed there for just that purpose.<br>  The fate of Crockett is controversial (though why as a retired LtCol I don't understand.  There's nothing cowardly about being taken prisoner and executed.), but most historians now lean to the theory he was taken prisoner-General Cos at least they were probably others, asked Santa Ana to grant him parole; and executed.|`|bnA0wUPRaa	A few thousand vs 160 Texans. 40 or so of the Texans where Mexican themselves.|`|keLd4vpYaa	2400 mexican troops vs 180-260 texans|`|pDtoi6FUaa	it depends on how many BURITOS YOU HAVE..... jk its estimated around too be 4000 beaucasue it was in mexican territory.

0alHMNi9aa	It's threatening behaviour and you need to control it, if you had hit him he would be able to get you charged with assault but you didn't.  I think if he did inform the police about your behaviour they would probably just give you a warning but if you explained and had a witness they may decide not to do anything.  It is down to your friend whether he goes to the police or not, probably won't.
AA11494150	Once a warrant is entered into the computer, it is visible anywhere in the state. Even if your PO misses it, they will run you when you report for jail, and it will show up then.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Yes, as long as its put into the computer it will be found.<br>  <br>  Every time I run someone, I get a nation wide report.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yes there will be a warrant if you don't show up and do your 30 days in jail (court ordered). Your probation officer may find out about the warrant in another county if they do one of there random searches (criminal search) which they do every so often, to  make sure your not getting into trouble in other areas.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	your po knows everything about you so dont play it stupid .|`|kHYRznVBaa	Nowadays the answer to that is simple: YES!

It really sickens me to see all these answers and see how much people try to control other people's actions when they aren't harming anyone, but if the tables were turned and somebody tried to stop them for something they were doing I bet they wouldn't like it as much. If its not under someones control then they aren't happy. I really don't care about the sign. He has the freedom to do so. It is called freedom of speech. That's what it means to be living here in AMERICA. The foundation of america was built on exactly this kind of freedom. Don't let this bother you and if it does then grow up. Worry about making a better nation and not about a sign that a guy put up according to his thoughts and beliefs. Don't embarrass yourselves even more...

America has soldiers in japan so I would like to see that to.<br>  <br>  The national gaurd of michigan has more soldiers than the entire canadian army.  There are 700,000 gun owner in michigan, america has a draft.  Canada has no draft and an army of 70,000 including reserves and everything.  There are more fighter planes in Montana air base than all of Canada.. Canada depends on USA for protection, we cannot control our own borders.  In Alerta, on the north pole Canada is a US army base.  US has nukes canada does not.<br>  <br>  The drug barons have more power than the mexican government.  If any state breaks away from america it is more likely to be its own nation than to join a weaker country like mexico or one with not military like canada.<br>  <br>  Once again there is a huge problem with this theory.  Liberals control major cities, conservatives control the country side.  If a war broke out, the cities have all the weapons so guess who wins. The city has all the guns storesand so on.<br>  The first state to join a new country would unite america.

Do you think he became president by accident?  His globalist backers have been working on this plan for years, including during the Clinton and Bush administrations.  They are all CFR members, and it seems like everyone outside of the US can see what's happening.  Too many Americans refuse to see the 'big picture', and it will be far too late when they realize they've been duped and deceived.  Neo-communist controlled New World Order is at our doorstep.  The Russians, the British, the Europeans all know it.  Obama's lemming followers can't think themselves out of a paper bag, and yet will be responsible for the ultimate destruction of a free America.<br>  <br>  Have you checked out Yuri Bezmenov's video?  It was made in the 1970's, and Bezmenov (a former KGB agent) explains step by step how the communist mind-set infiltrates a free society and ultimately causes its demise.

They have universal healthcare, strong materity leave laws, more holidays and vacation time (except the Japanese, those people work way too hard) and great public transportation.  <br>  <br>  Properly applied (as in not wasting it on wars of choice or billions on pallets for Haliburton or bridges to nowhere) taxes are good.  Improperly applied, they anger the law abiding taxpayer.  One state's important project is a pundit's pork.  What seems like a bad idea to some is usually small potatoes in the overall budget, yet the big ticket nonsense like Star Wars missiles get passed because of all of the jobs they create, and there are better ways to create good paying jobs with projects that benefit all of the taxpayers, not just a handful.  <br>  <br>  I don't like paying taxes, but I don't mind if the country gets it's money's worth.

Initially he was blocked by conservatism, but in 1933,when Adolf Hitler saw his demonstration of mobile tank warfare, he understood the potential of the tanks and Guderian's ideas were given high priority. Under Guderian's leadership, Germany built a powerful "Panzer" (armor) force that was, together with strong air support tactics, the basis for its overwhelming Blitzkrieg (lightning war) tactic. <br>  <br>  Between 1933 and 1945, the German industry developed and produced a series of tank types which were called "Panzerkampfwagen" which means "Armored Fighting Vehicle". In short they were called "Panzer" (armor). <br>  <br>  German tank types<br>  Panzer I<br>  A very small light tank (6 tons) with a crew of two, driver and commander, armed with two light 0.3" machine guns (with 1500 rounds), which was produced in the mid 1930s as a training tank. Over 800 tanks were produced in 1935, and the tank was used by the German forces which participated in the Spanish civil war. <br>  When World War 2 started the German army had nearly 1500 Panzer I tanks. They participated in the Blitzkrieg invasion of Poland in 1939, although it was known that they are not suitable for front line fighting because of their lack of firepower and very thin armor. In the Blitzkrieg invasion of France in 1940 only 500 of them participated. The others remained in Germany and Poland. <br>  <br>  By the end of 1941 they were no longer used in front line service, except a command tank version, which contained a small map table and extra radio equipment for use by Panzer unit commanders. The chassis of the obsolete tanks was converted for carrying ammunition or an anti-tank gun, but these also became obsolete and were phased out.

So I hope he takes this into consideration as he starts cutting.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make much sense, since, in my opinion, some programs that do not need to be there are those such as saving mice (Pelosi's project in the stimulus)  If they would stop putting ridiculous spending on the taxpayer in the first place, maybe we wouldn't have as much of a deficit and maybe the programs needed would work.<br>  <br>  Many will bring up the war.  And while that has added to the deficit, of course, and regardless of whether one thinks we should have been there or not, the fact remains we are there.  If we pull out to soon, we will have to go back.  Afganistan also, learn from experience, we pulled out of there, and what are we doing now?   Going back.   If we cut spending on our military, we endanger the lives of Americans risking their life for us, regardless of whether you think we should be there or not, those fighting are not directly responsible fro being there and they should not be put at risk.<br>  <br>  I don't think that he will be able to accomplish cutting the deficit in half in four years, as you said, it is said to take 40 for only a Trillion.  Short of taxing the people of this country to the point that they can no longer afford to care for themself, what other options are there?  <br>  <br>  I just think that all this spending is not going to work and we will be in a bigger mess than we started with.  I hope I am wrong by all means, but it doesn't look good.
fecUjSr1aa	as long as you are issued a green card, you can be a green beret. the military is just like any employer, you have a green card? you can enter the military. <br>  <br>  and then do your time, and then you can work on your citizenship.<br>  <br>  being a u.s. military doesn't entitle you automatic citizenship. i've known several non-u.s. nationals in service in the u.s. navy who never became citizens inspite of their length of service - some did 15 yrs and still not citizens. you may want to look into this matter and see what gives.|`|AA11404742	I believe that non-citizens can join the US military, and earn their citizenship in part through this process.  I doubt that you have to become a member of the special forces to do so.<br>  <br>  Call a recruiter for details.

More than he won with.|`|reeU4N0eaa	no way|`|AA10317675	Obama certainly did get some votes he woudl not have gotten if it wasn't for his race,  but he also lost some votes that would have gone to a Democrat if a black dem was running.  So it was likely a wash.  Same results in the generla election.<br>  <br>  But I do think Obama won the primaries to a big degree due to his race.|`|nS83ag9raa	nope...because otherwise it would have been "just another election"|`|OUo9J4i1aa	Yes he is much younger and ambitious then McCain or whatever his name is and plus Sarah Palin is the worse pollitition ever.|`|ED433Q6Yaa	white guilt and black pride. affirmative action white house appointment. his numbers prove he does not now what he is doing.|`|102f032dfc7dad2b1b96978795427516aa	probably not!  :)|`|YaTgrhr9aa	Nope Obama would have lost|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	yes i do think and i voted for him because hes a democrat|`|3YzXWHwbaa	maybe, It certainly helped his cause.  <br>  I did not vote for him because he was inexperienced and, although smooth-he lacked the tenure needed to make a strong president.<br>  I would have liked to have seen him as president, say, in about 10 years after he had some more experience.<br>  I do wish there had been a better alternative choice, I do not mind McCain but his age was a drawback certainly, even if he was a progressive republican-he was still old and old minds are not as open to new ideas.  <br>  I think Obama will do fine as President-the people love him, they will give him room to err and recover.  It is a tough job.<br>  Race has nothing to do with being a good or bad President.|`|5b820805b9932bc37844045b822eddbeaa	This is not a black or white situation here ok.<br>  <br>  It's just that America is tired of being lied, fooled, and under-minded by a GOP leadership that cost this country lives, debt, lost jobs and homes.<br>  <br>  Look, do you realize that alot of the red states turned blue which indicates this is not about color, this is about CHANGE!!<br>  <br>  On Nov. 4th this country spoke out LOUD and the world agreed as well.|`|1iXvphNYaa	If it's obvious then it is. Why ask the question? Frankly, it would play some factor. But to say it was simply color that got him there is in my mind, obviously, ignorance. Have you ever listened to him talk? Have you ever seen him smile. He's young, he doesn't give the impression of an uptight politician with views etched in granite. We knew what we needed, something new, something that should have been long ago, and now we have it.

Obviously.|`|WyNOAZb9aa	If a Caucasian  Most Junior Senator with the least experience had been nominated, no one would have voted for them.  <br>  We need experience, not rhetoric.  <br>  <br>  And you are not being racist....

Tax and spend, or in this case spend then tax policies will seal his fate as a one term president|`|TE8zN8g9aa	I really don't think he will...so many of the people that I know that voted for him already are disappointed in the job he's doing...he's probably already lost lots of support.|`|YZIqiZEWaa	I Hope somebody takes over him their is just 1 thing i don't like about him and im not sure.<br>  Don't you like him neither? if so i like you!<br>  <br>  Clinton Or somebodyy else decent.|`|AA10928202	Correction.

yGXKYptjaa	Last pres that did that was Clinton and took away from military and roads and stuff, since then there is no such animal as a "Fiscal conservative".  The parties are about the same except for a couple of things they will never agree on.  Biggest mistake of Bush was using Reagan's' plan during wars, what will be Obama's mistake at this point.  We are in uncharted waters due to the amount of crooked stuff that Wall Street and financial people have done not only to us but the WORLD!  Somebody has to do something, I suggest talking with Ron Paul.For the stimulus to work it needs to be fives times as big and from a surplus!|`|DlQd0m0Daa	No, your funny! The cons are the libs. Libs don't care. Conservatives on the other hand disagreed with all of it. The calls in to congress over the first bailout went 1000 to 1 against.

More importantly in this case, we understand when 'off budget items' like trillions in stimulus and bailout and military funding aren't included in a budget later claimed to be balanced.  If he makes all his spending off budget items, he could even get a budget surplus.  So what, if he increases spending and the national debt?<br>  <br>  Smoke and mirrors.  He may fool some of his own base is all, if they don't understand rudimentary accounting.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	No because the cons aren't as easily conned as the libbies are.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Of course not.

Our economy has been in far worse shape before and rebounded without any absurd and outrageous "Stimulus Bills".  The alleged "crisis" HAS to happen now, that way the Blame can be placed on the previous administration.

It's a vote getting wet dream.|`|JthubNIsaa	What happend to the "scalpel" Obama said he would use to trim the budget? As far as it stands now, he overlooked everything he was against when he was running for President. Guess he only said that because that's what McCain said.

Well, I guess many folks will hold him in very high regard if his Mission is successful... he is the attack from within, the one bin laden promised would change our political landscape, and crush our economy... so far, 60+ million voters are seeing to it that the attack succeeds.<br>  <br>  Martyrs don't care if they survive ( in this case, re-election), they just care that the mission succeeds...|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Easy. The more things go down, the more he can claim to be the "savior" that comes to the rescue. A large portion of his constituents look to the government to care for them and solve their problems. By constantly screaming "CRISIS!!!!" and "CATASTROPHE!!!", to this base, he can appear to be swooping in and saving them. The more control he exerts...massive federal expansion...the more chance he has to keep this voting base. But just to cover his losses, he included medical care for illegals in the package. Why? New voters who are dependant upon the governnment.|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	It wouldn't in the real world.  But the right wing is convinced that Obama is trying to take over the country and make it a dictatorship as Hitler did.  Crazy, but unfortunately what I am seeing on here.  See Agent Smith's answer...|`|6AgnCKCPaa	It wouldn't help him but he is stuck having to pay back a lot of people for getting him into office and I honestly don't think the guy is bright enough to know how bad the bill really is..|`|Yzb44aV6aa	Unless you got some sort of psychic powers...you wouldnt really know if the stimulus bill will be a failure and our economy will be destroyed...!<br>  <br>  Please start asking actual educated questions|`|4eLzY2hfaa	because this bozo really believes it!!|`|wCy1iTsGaa	It would not help him at all but maybe he just has no clue on how to fix it.

If she gets mad, that's her problem. She is posting on a public forum, asking for replies, and therefore has nothing to get mad about when she gets them, regardless of how many she gets. If she asked you to stop emailing her, then stop, and if you know an ad is her's, then don't reply again, since it is obviously not doing anything good...but beside that, nothing will happen for you having replied. <br>  <br>  And twilight- you are sadly misinformed. Please do some research before you run around insulting people and making crazy accusations. While there have been a few problem people on craigslist, the majority of the ads are more likely to be scammers than any "victims" of the types of abuse you mention. And, since you have NO idea what the exchange was between the ad poster and the person asking this question, you have no business making any kind of judgments or accusations. Speak to what you KNOW, not what you think you know.

0MeR1C1maa	I am SAYING he's hot. I also said he is in Borneo until Thursday.<br>  <br>  The problem with your question is that you are basically asking someone how to do surgery on a problem that has not been diagnosed.  Someone needs to get their arms around your entire financial situation in order to understand the disease before they can start surgery to cut out the diseased part.<br>  <br>  I have read the Professor's answers to your earlier questions, and he is telling you the same thing,  You want to pretend that there is a one-size-fits-all answer to your problem, and that is just not the way it works.  A professional will have to understand your entire debt scenario--yours and your late husband's--in order to give you any meaningful advice.

I'm sure that in order to be consdiered then at the very least you would need a waiver of sorts. A recruiter is the only person who could coordinate this for you.|`|40be38b32a6cdfa4e662892e1c0ed7adaa	Yes, some services do allow RE-4's to enlist, but you need a waiver. And that is the extent of my knowledge, therefore ask a recruiter for some in depth knowledge.

Yes we have to defend our country, that goes with out saying.  But where were the weapons of mass destruction that we kept hearing about?  I'm still waiting to see those!   I also didn't see him doing much of any thing about the failing economy before he left office and he had an entire year to be doing some thing about it.  What great steps did he take to help fix what is happening to our country?  None that I saw!  Since it just kept getting worse.  The only thing that I saw was him leaving office, with his big fat pay check that he will be getting for the rest of his life!<br>    <br>  I think that would be a huge mistake to sit back and do nothing at all, to just leave things the way that they were.

The people themselves are its only safe depositories."

UWL7Ncqtaa	im really sorry for the situation you have been put in, but at the moment there is no way for people in your situation to receive legalization unless another amnesty program is passed. the easiest way for an undocumented immigrant to get papers is through marriage but even then most people must return to back to their country of origin to receive, file the paper work and be interviewed. (takes around 4 months) but even then, that isn't a guarantee. As far as working, the only jobs available that wont ask for papers are probably really sketchy, and the only other option is to get a fake green card, or visa. but this puts you at risk for being caught, especially if you live ina state where e-verify is required. <br>  <br>  you could try to return back to your country and apply there, but we all know that could potentially take years, and you don't seem to have years to wait. <br>  <br>  so your best bet is to hold on and see if another amesty will be passed soon. i wish you the best of luck. god bless|`|XYBHM8aSaa	You have to back to Mexico and apply there.

I think that as long as you have proof you have been here that long and have not done anything illegaly, then you should be fine.  Also, you need to be saving money no matter what because most paperwork to get a green card cost a lot, probably close to one or two thousand dollars, sometimes more depending out how many forms you need to complete.<br>  Good Luck.|`|3vToYNA2aa	If you don't want to get yourself in a trouble there are no shortcut...pay 50 bucks for a lawyer consultation and make your own decision.

KKH9y0ECaa	EU Law takes precedence over national law and therefore automatically supercedes UK Law.<br>  <br>  How does the European Legal System work?<br>  <br>  The current powers of the ECJ are laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. These powers will increase when the Lisbon Treaty is implemented in 2009 because it extends the ECJ jurisdiction to Justice and Home Affairs policy for the first time.  The ECJ uses three sources for interpreting EU law: the EU treaties, articles of those treaties, and broader principles of law.<br>  <br>  The court can act in three ways.  Firstly it can bring about cases called infringement proceedings against member states that fail to comply with EU legislation.  Secondly, it can review legislative and executive acts passed by EU institutions to ensure their legality.  Finally many national courts hand cases up to the ECJ to rule on, in what are known as preliminary rulings.<br>  <br>  The principles of direct effect and supremacy of EU law guide the implementation of ECJ rulings and the legal framework within which it acts.  These joint principles give the ECJ a large amount of judicial power within member states.  Supremacy allows the ECJ to establish primacy for European laws while direct effect means that these laws then apply to people as well as to states – making them more like domestic laws then international acts.  There has been some resistance to this development.  In the 1993 Brenner judgement, the German Courts decided that they could rule acts of the EU beyond the EU’s legal authority if the act breached the German Constitution.|`|t79pLOCUaa	Automatically by  the various treaties that have been signed but originally the Treaty of Rome which the Uk signed in 1972..|`|KTNqah9eaa	I think every law or regulation made by the EU has to be confirmed by member states where it is to apply. So in the UK it should always require a new Act of Parliament or at least a new regulation under an existing Act of Parliament. Hope that helps.
