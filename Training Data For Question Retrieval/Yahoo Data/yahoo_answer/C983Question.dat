20090220105734AAaLEwc	Sports;Basketball	Should NBA season be shorter?	Before I begin      PLEASE DON'T COMPARE BASEBALL TO BASKETBALL. They have longer seasons but they're is a little contact when compared to basketball and they run less. The only ones that do need to rest is the pitcher and the catcher. Everyone else in the outfield just waits.      If NBA seasons were shorter you would get to watch players perform better because they are not fatigued from back to back games.  So you would see more exciting games instead of the half assed ones. Good example is T-MAC. When he is rested he plays amazing but when he's tired he only gives about 60%.       Less injuries would occur. I'm not talking about an eye injury like Amare but the ones that develop when too much stress brought upon over time like KG's knee and countless number of ankle injuries.      From a business standpoint it makes sense. They can charge more for a ticket due to the increase demand. Besides Lion games all NFL games are pretty much sold out because their is only one game a week to see. NBA games like the Grizzlies struggle just to get their courtside tickets sold. They could even pay players less.      Just once I would like to see every team competing at full strength so you do not hear any excuses about injuries.

20090220113405AAnHqMY	Sports;Football (American)	Should the Raiders dip into free agency for a quarterback?	JaMarcus Russell hasn't really done much to show that he is worthy of the contract given to him much less a starting job in the NFL.  He's had a few decent games but his horrible performances much out way those few highlights.  Maybe not even this year, but if I were the Raiders I would seriously be looking into a new quarterback for my team, especially keeping my ear to the ground as far as quarterbacks who will become unrestricted free agents in 2010.  If he doesn't show vast improvement in 2009 I say it's time to start looking for a new signal caller.  Thoughts?

20090220112616AAPKIEs	Sports;Wrestling	Mickie James Fans-Assuming She is Healthy, Should She Get Another Push as Champion?	MJ is really an excellent wrestler, assuming she is healthy, should she get another push as Women's Champ after Melina?   To make her more interesting, you need to give her more "mike" time; really JR is the best interviewer--the others suck; Lawler would be ok if he wasn't so concerned even at this late date at putting himself over. She also needs some good opponents; that is hard in talent starved WWE women's division--maybe against Gail Kim.      Bonus: Would you like to see her doingsome commentary?  I think she has excellent mike skills--she is intelligent, has good  personality, and speaks well--maybe groom her to ace out that idiot Michael "the Tool" Cole eventually.       I am obviously a fan of hers although I prefer Joshi or Indy wrestlers more but-yes to the REAL Mickie James fans: she is a very pretty girl and it would have been interesting to see her wrestle Madusa, Manami Toyota, Akira Hokatu, Kyoko Inoue and even Bull Nakano.  Trish would have gotten her azz kicked and Lita would have done pretty well--but lost.       The WWE tools and trools persecuted Molly Holly for having a big azz--ditto for Mickie James--where do these fools think the power and balance to do the moves Molly and Mickie do in the ring comes from?  Not for nothing, but Trish Stratus did not have a bony butt.

Here's a question that longtime NBA fans and especially Phoenix Suns history buffs may be able to answer: am I right in thinking that as far as the impact he's made on the Suns team and franchise, Amare Stoudemire is more like Larry Nance than Charles Barkley? Nance was the high-flying Suns forward who played well as a Sun but was eventually traded to Cleveland with others for Kevin Johnson. And I suspect that Stoudemire, like Nance, is going to be traded eventually, because he's good but just not good enough. He just never became the second coming of Charles Barkley. What do you think?

I have the 10th pick.  We get to keep 2 hitters and 2 pitchers.  My players, by round they would count against me if kept.      1. Peavy   2. Braun   2. Crawford   3. Webb   4  putz   5  Markakis   6  No Player (traded Halladay straight up for Braun)   7 Carlos Pena   8  Penny   9  shields   10  Corpas   11 Javy Vazquez   12  Orlando hudson   13 Victorino   14  Peralta   15 Chris B Young   16  Saltalamacchia   17  Todd Jones   18 Adam LaRoche   19  CLayton Kershaw   20 Bartolo colon   21 Aki Iwamura   22 Josh Willingham   23 Ryan Doumit, Alexei Ramirez, Brian Fuentes, Melvin Mora, or Mike Aviles      I'm leaning towards Braun and Alexei ramirez as hitters and Webb and Fuentes (walked into what i hope is a save factory in anaheim) as my pitchers.  Braun and Webb would eliminate my 2, 3rd picks, but thats pick 15 and 34, which i think is well worth it for those players.. any thoughts?  Who would you be keeping and why?

Quite a few Dale stuff was stolen in the process.  One thing that was taken was a framed photo my dad got my mom prior to his passing so it holds many memories and emotions for her and she's beside herself.        The picture was taken the day that Dale Earnhardt won the Daytona 500.  He is driving down pit road and all the teams are out congratulating him on his win.  It's a large panaramic photo and for the life of me I cannot remember the title of this photo.      Does anyone have any leads on where I could possibly look for and/or find this photo?  It may not be coming from my Dad but least she'd still have those memories.and her picture back.      Thanks for the help.

They don't play against the same defenses that Jordan, Drexler Magic, Bird, The Big O etc. played against. The NBA now has a def 3 seconds rule, no handchecking and a lot of tick tack fouls. Imagine how hard it would be for guys to get to the rim if someone was getting physical with them on the perimeter and Dwight Howard and Yao Ming were living in the paint. It's pretty hard to compare Kobe, D-Wade, LeBron etc. to players in other decades when the defensive rules have changed so much.

20090220114915AArVjfM	Sports;Cricket	For those well-versed with Allan Stanford's program...?	When you first came across the concept of "Stanford 20/20" and the like, did you really believe that he was going to "help West Indies cricket" as he claims?       Did you believe that West Indies cricket "needs help" in the first place? Sure, the Test side isn't the "force to be reckoned with" as it was in the days of Sir Viv, Brian Lara, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, and the rest, but certainly as a Test side, they don't really "need help", do they?      And I know that there are certain Islands who do not have the necessary infrastructure, financial resources and personnel in place to develop their cricketers to the highest level, but for West Indies as a whole it shouldn't matter that much, because it's the same thing in countries like India and Australia. There are areas which are poverty-stricken or which are just so far removed geographically from normal civilization such that the talent which exists there will never be recognized.      Methinks that for "Sir" Allan, it's more of a case of trying to find a "market" to promote his business ventures, and ultimately, his ulterior motives, rather than trying to "help" a country in need. If he needed to "help" someone, he could have easily "helped" Bangladesh, Ireland or Canada, right?

20090220130351AAECepB	Sports;Basketball	Do you think I have a chance to be MVP?	Well, for the past 2 years there's been this girl who gets MVP in basketball and volleyball! And I'm trying to change that! So this year I've really stepped up my game, and I found out that I'm a defence player! And not just any Defeence player, the best on the team! And I'm not bragging or thinking that highly of myself, it's just that whenever I'm out on that courtit seams that the other team doesn't make as many points, but when I'm on the bench they sort of make alot of points! And I'm fast, I'm not tall( one of my flaws) but I am really fast! When somebodys making a fast break and I'm all the way on the other side of the gym, I get there in time to stop them from making that basket. I'll admit I'm not that great on offence, but I do make at least 4 points every game! And I steal the ball ALOT and in one game, half of our points were made because I stole the ball and got it to the person who shot it in!   And besides my defence skill after every game I ALWAYS ask my coach "What can I do to make me a better player?" Or something to that extent like "Did you see anything tonight that you think I need to work on?" Also, I usually help bring the basketballs down from his room, and collect the pennys and put the basketballs back in the bag!   Whereas the other girl who gets MVP thinks she's the star! I'll admit she's good, but her big head gets in the way(too much to go into now)! She never pays attention in practice like she's too good for practice and doesn't need it. And whenever she or her sister get taken out they literally scream at the 5 other players out there to stop making stupid mistakes! And they also ask the coach to be put back in the game, more like demand him to!   So I was just wondering basedon all that information do you think that I could actually be MVP this year?

I've neglected my cycling over the winter and I am wanting to build in a significant ride into my daily commute so that I have little reason not to train. I work in Sheffield and I am thinking about moving to Nottingham to provide a decent gap between the two. The shortest distance is 38 miles using A roads, about 45 miles using the cycle network.      I know I can ride the distance, even if at the moment I am slightly out of shape and about a stone overweight, my question is how advisable is this for five days a week? Will the eight hours in between each trip provide enough opportunity for recovery or will it kill me? Will I eventually get used to doing this distance nearly every day or almost certainly suffer from overtraining?      Many thanks.

20090220132706AArJ51T	Sports;Basketball	Why is Duke still in the top 10?	Look, I'll put this out there to start. I hate Duke. hell, I hate UNC too. They both annoy me and i find lots of things to complain about them. However, I am always able to recognize when my complaints are just my hatred for them coming out in words to try to tear them down. And i've been able to recognize that ever since i've been a college basketball fan.       This year however, has been different. There are two things that I have noticed this season that have really pissed me off about ESPN and the sports media.      1) and the least of the two: UNC was heralded as being the best team ever and maybe the first to go undefeated since way back when. Ok, I get it..its media hype, it'll pass when they lose, right? Wrong...Even after losing to unranked Boston College AT HOME...ESPN still said "oh, they are the best team in the country" Even after losing at Wake...still the same thing. The reason this doesnt make me so mad any more is becuase now they recognize that UNC is beatable by a handful teams and may not be as good as, say, Oklahoma, Pitt, UConn, to name a few.      2. AND HERES THE BIG ONE: Duke is still in the top 10 after this stretch of pathetic play? I get it...ok...Duke is like the NY Yankees, USC in football, the Patriots, the Lakers, the Red Wings..blah blah..they are media darlings. But what do they have in common? With the exception of the Lakers...the above named teams have rarely won championships in the last Decade. Isn't time to get over it?      Anyway...on to my complaint:      In the last SEVEN games, Duke has lost FOUR effing times. And before the latest rankings came out, it was FOUR of SIX. Granted they lost to 3 top 10 teams but they lost by ALMOST 30 at Clemson, and got whooped at home by UNC. Their first loss in the stretch was by 2 points to Wake, which is understandable. But they have LOST FOUR OUT OF SEVEN games. And ALMOST lost to Miami (AT HOME!!!) and played piss poor tonight against St. Johns.      So, would somebody PLEASE explain to me WHY they are still in the top 10 and what it will take to drop them into the bottom 10 or even out of the top 25. If they lose to Wake on sunday, they will probably still be in the top 10...why? Because they beat St. John's. Is it just more, or is media bias in sports becoming UBER obvious over the last few years.      One last Complaint: When the new rankings come out monday...they will probably be:      1. Oklahoma (unless they lose to Texas on Sat)   2. North Carolina   3. Pittsburgh   4. Connecticut   5. Memphis      This makes me mad for 1 major reason: North Carolina has lost twice: Boston College (50 RPI) and Wake (16 RPI). Oklahoma has lost once, but it was to Arkansas(126 RPI). PITT has lost twice, also..but to two really good teams: Louisville (15 RPI) and 'Nova (10 RPI). If you take into consideration the fact that they lost those games AWAY and while major contributors on their team were sick and Blair fouled out, AND they are #1 in RPI...how can you NOT consider them the best team in the country?
20090220131913AAo52Eg	Sports;Football (American)	What do you want your team to do in the offseason? Draft + Free Agency?	I'm a steelers fan and think we need to draft a lineman with the 32 pick. Maybe trade up like 10 spots to get a better one. Then get another lineman in the 2nd round. After that go defensive line in the 3rd round and a WR like derrick williams in the 4th round because hines is getting old and nate washington is a free agent.      Free agents: Resign Nate Washington, Marvel Smith and Byron Leftwich if possible. I doubt we will go out and sign a big name lineman because we don't do that often.      what do you want your team to do?
