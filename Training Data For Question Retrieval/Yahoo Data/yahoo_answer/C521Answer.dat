Try a high fibre diet including something like Kellogs All bran, or similar cereals, fruit and vegetables,and there are drinks like Metamucil which will help.<br>  Stay away from junk food like McDonalds, Kentucky fried and so on.

vATSp61Faa	Acai berry wil not make you lose weight, where did you get this idea? The makers don't even claim that. Acai brries have a very similar nutritional content of blueberries. Do you comprehend? eating one healthy thing will not lose you weight. Easting only 2 meals per day will slow down the rate at which your body breaks down materials which will make it even harder for you to lose weight. Eat 6 small meals at specific intervals through the day. Acai berries side affects include dissapointment at not losing weight and a decreased bank balance.|`|0RHO560Caa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.
fAFXkikAaa	Herpes is very sneaky because you can have herpes for years without ever having symptoms.  <br>  <br>  You are right that herpes is spread by TOUCH, not by fluids.  So she won't catch genital herpes by kissing.    And you don't necessarily catch it from a single incident.  If he is having an outbreak, then the chance of her catching it is quite high.   If he is not having an outbreak, then the chance is lower, but not zero.<br>  <br>  To make things more complicated, once you are infected with a virus (say HSV2) in one place, and your body has had a few months to build up antibodies, it is difficult to catch it on another part of your body.   Your immune system is prepared this time for this virus, and so it is unlikely - perhaps impossible - to catch the same virus in two places at two different times.<br>  <br>  But if he is having an outbreak, and she kisses him on the mouth AND recieves oral sex from him, she could very well catch it in both places.  Her body doesn't have any antibodies yet, so an infection in both places is quite possible.   And, as I stated before, she may not show any symptoms.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps?

iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch. <br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  Hope it helps!|`|6jSxYrZnaa	I have just answered this: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtfTiOxRaMxLh1opWQMVkPzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222163621AAKDj65&show=7#profile-info-3Oob9MIZaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> Considering it's the right answer it's worth you clicking.

That is the best thing you could do.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

If you want to hit your lower stomach too, do straight leg raises laying down flat on the floor, raising your feet up about 2 feet, with your legs straight.

I have really bad sinuses and I have yr around allergies. <br>  <br>  Sinus infection (Sinusitis) is just an inflammation, or swelling, of the tissue lining the sinuses.sinuses are filled with air, but when sinuses become blocked and filled with fluid, germs (bacteria, viruses and fungi) can grow and cause an infection.<br>  <br>  there isn't a lot they can do.. they can give you an antibiotic to help, but really it just has to run it's course.<br>  <br>  also you know if you have a sinus infection if the mucous that comes out of your nose is discolored (green,yellow, any combo of that)<br>  <br>  it doesn't have anything to do with your teeth although you can feel some pressure when you chew on food. the pressure and pain should usually be between your eyes and all the way down your nose and around your eyes sometimes above the nose in the forehead region.|`|FqgCZvvPaa	a sinus infection is caused by bacteria, it is in the sinus that are in the cheek bone.

But i think i might have the answer. that skelaxin was heavy enough, you know, but then marijuana and that energy drink overrode your nervous system. That all connects to your brain, and that made your frontal lobe (which i believe hosts your vision center) hype out. You might have something to worry about, if anything happens like that in the future (skelaxin, marijuana, energy drink or not) get a doctor, or professional help.

On average people use somewhere around 1500 to 2000 calories a day, so you need to eat less than that if you want to lose weight.  Also, one pound is equivalent to about 3000 calories,  which is more that most people use in the entire day.  Try to work out to maximize the amount of calories you use each day, and try to limit the amount of calories you intake to a minimum.  write down everything you eat and about how many calories it is so that you don't eat more than you use.|`|6jXPL9eWaa	Depends on how much you excersize daily but for a basal metabolic rate...your amount of calorie intake is 1275 daily.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

r8IfXQQWaa	Whey protein is a good place to start. Also a good weight lifting program. If you don't have access to a gym, i recommend basics like push ups, sit ups, squats, pull ups/ chin ups. It may seem that the only way to get muscles is a complicated workout like an expert body builder would do, but its not. Muscles develop best when used in compound and basic exercises. Once you get a good muscle base, then you can start isolating your exercises to define different muscles. I'm 17, and have tried whey protein, creatine, ripped fuel, and a few other supplements and to be honest, the best thing to do is to just work hard at your workout. Hope this helps.|`|I69nqk2Haa	Use them sparingly.  I cause myself alot of probs taking fat burner supplements and creatinine.  Very hard on your liver and kidneys. Protein is fine but make sure your balanced.... protein is very hard on your kidneys so drink alot of water.  <br>  <br>  Personal advice.  Take a multi vitamin for men. B-complex. A little calcium and protein.<br>  <br>  All that other crap just equates to expensive urine.|`|l9vuJY30aa	well im 16 and i've drank muscle milk and protein shakes, i also made the servings as directed and nothing bad has happened to me.<br>  i cant really see the effectiveness of drinking these either so maybe im doing it wrong? or too little..? haha good luck|`|f3bceea3f571ce0b9aeb917dd9b9bd0aaa	Yes, those are safe just figure out how much you weight in kilograms.<br>  <br>  If you weight 50 kilos, then you should take 50 grams of protein a day.

First few years it is normal to b irregular.<br>  :)|`|83mIrPXzaa	As previously posted, it’s quite normal to be irregular at first (and possibly throughout your life).  The irregularity could be caused by a multiple factors (e.g. just how your body operates, medications, stress (!!! – if you stress of this, it will probably not help your situation), fluctuations in weight, caffeine usage – and the list goes on).  There is no reason this should be an indication that you will be unable to conceive children.  With medical advances being what they are and continuing to improve, do not fret this early on.  If you still worry about it, I’d recommend making an appointment with your OB/GYN and discussing it with them.  They will be the best resource to diagnose exactly what is causing the irregular periods.  Good luck!|`|FsFp4f1Yaa	Don't be worried the first 3 years my mom had her period she got it once every 2 months. Just like the commericals say, every woman's period is different.

cQ6UFMmyaa	3rd hand smoke refers to the smoke smell and residue left on clothing after smoking or being around a smoker.<br>  <br>  This is as harmful as first and second hand smoke|`|I8szWmVMaa	never heard of it. if it is real, lol maybe someone smokes, someone else brings it in, then he/she breathes it out, and another person breathes it in.  If you are confused, I will make an example of what i think.<br>  <br>  So bob smokes, then jerry breathes that in, then he breathes out the smoke, but then frank breathes it in. Lol i think thats not real.|`|tI1Ws7PGaa	well actually many people have wondered about this and now scientist have proved it just read this article A New Cigarette Hazard: ‘Third-Hand Smoke’ <br>  <br>  Parents who smoke often open a window or turn on a fan to clear the air for their children, but experts now have identified a related threat to children’s health that isn’t as easy to get rid of: third-hand smoke.<br>  <br>  That’s the term being used to describe the invisible yet toxic brew of gases and particles clinging to smokers’ hair and clothing, not to mention cushions and carpeting, that lingers long after second-hand smoke has cleared from a room. The residue includes heavy metals, carcinogens and even radioactive materials that young children can get on their hands and ingest, especially if they’re crawling or playing on the floor.<br>  <br>  Doctors from MassGeneral Hospital for Children in Boston coined the term “third-hand smoke” to describe these chemicals in a new study that focused on the risks they pose to infants and children. The study was published in this month’s issue of the journal Pediatrics.<br>  <br>  “Everyone knows that second-hand smoke is bad, but they don’t know about this,” said Dr. Jonathan P. Winickoff, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. <br>  <br>  “When their kids are out of the house, they might smoke. Or they smoke in the car. Or they strap the kid in the car seat in the back and crack the window and smoke, and they think it’s okay because the second-hand smoke isn’t getting to their kids,” Dr. Winickoff continued. “We needed a term to describe these tobacco toxins that aren’t visible.” <br>  <br>  Third-hand smoke is what one smells when a smoker gets in an elevator after going outside for a cigarette, he said, or in a hotel room where people were smoking. “Your nose isn’t lying,” he said. “The stuff is so toxic that your brain is telling you: ’Get away.’”<br>  <br>  The study reported on attitudes toward smoking in 1,500 households across the United States. It found that the vast majority of both smokers and nonsmokers were aware that second-hand smoke is harmful to children. Some 95 percent of nonsmokers and 84 percent of smokers agreed with the statement that “inhaling smoke from a parent’s cigarette can harm the health of infants and children.”<br>  <br>  But far fewer of those surveyed were aware of the risks of third-hand smoke. Since the term is so new, the researchers asked people if they agreed with the statement that “breathing air in a room today where people smoked yesterday can harm the health of infants and children.” Only 65 percent of nonsmokers and 43 percent of smokers agreed with that statement, which researchers interpreted as acknowledgement of the risks of third-hand smoke.<br>  <br>  The belief that second-hand smoke harms children’s health was not independently associated with strict smoking bans in homes and cars, the researchers found. On the other hand, the belief that third-hand smoke was harmful greatly increased the likelihood the respondent also would enforce a strict smoking ban at home, Dr. Winickoff said.<br>  <br>  “That tells us we’re onto an important new health message here,” he said. “What we heard in focus group after focus group was, ‘I turn on the fan and the smoke disappears.’ It made us realize how many people think about second-hand smoke — they’re telling us they know it’s bad but they’ve figured out a way to do it.” <br>  <br>  The data was collected in a national random-digit-dial telephone survey done between September and November 2005. The sample was weighted by race and gender, based on census information.<br>  <br>  Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who heads the Children’s Environmental Health Center at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said the phrase third-hand smoke is a brand-new term that has implications for behavior.<br>  <br>  “The central message here is that simply closing the kitchen door to take a smoke is not protecting the kids from the effects of that smoke,” he said. “There are carcinogens in this third-hand smoke, and they are a cancer risk for anybody of any age who comes into contact with them.”<br>  <br>  Among the substances in third-hand smoke are hydrogen cyanide, used in chemical weapons; butane, which is used in lighter fluid; toluene, found in paint thinners; arsenic; lead; carbon monoxide; and even polonium-210, the highly radioactive carcinogen that was used to murder former Russian spy Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006. Eleven of the compounds are highly carcinogenic.|`|UpdfVOCLaa	Ridiculousness

GFLPgtDAaa	I think a full body cleanse is the best way to start.  Your body needs to be cleaned out first, and from that point on you will only put good things in it.  Exercise should be next on your list along with eating properly, and you should find a good diet plan that fits your need and lifestyle something that you can put up with.  I personally just lost a huge amount of weight without dieting but i just ate more veggies and cut back on my meats and i also stopped eating anything that had high amounts of fat.  I also invested in a treadmill and used it daily for about 2 months.  I dropped 40 pounds in two months without punishing myself just cutting back eating good proportions of food and lots and lots of veggies.|`|IiKBLjIpaa	Well, first you should focus just on food. To start, eat less, make your food portions smaller and begin drinking more water. Then, start cutting out junk food and replacing it with more fruits and veggies. This doesn't have to be all at once, just do it slow so you can get used to it. Then, after maybe a couple of weeks, start exercising a little, and increase the amount of exercise until you're doing about 40 mins three or four days a week. Gradual, baby steps is the key. If you try to do this all at once, you might find it overwhelming and give up.|`|8SRjELNBaa	No, not really.

Nerve, joint, bone and muscle pain can be controlled with medication. Lupus or any of the other auto immune diseases like arthritis, fibromyalgia, etc. do run in families. So, there is a likely hood that your GF will have the disease. <br>  People with Lupus can live full, productive lives, have children and have jobs, but they tend to have "attacks" where the disease is worse, then gets better,(as in less pain) -they need to have a doctor (neurologist or rheumetologist) that understands the disease and can treat the symptoms. They will prob have to take medicines most of their lives to keep the disease under control.  <br>  Your friend's mother may be able to apply for SSI or medicaid for low-income people, or get help from a clinic - or drug company for the medicines she needs for her disease.  She needs to investigate what is available. I'd suggest starting with the health department or Dept for children & families.|`|3v1JlqE4aa	my friend has that. but i cant help you here. sorry!|`|cA1IcgNHaa	Yes.Lupus is kind a genetic desease..but it would be passed to the females normally.<br>  <br>  I would say and be honest to u..There isnt any medication that can cure Lupus until now.There are some medication which just helping to reduce the effects (it becomes worser and worser actually when u have this desease)<br>  Well..under control?<br>  Hmm..Lupus is a desease which attacks the immun system of human.<br>  It becomes autoimmune...<br>  Just say easily<br>  autoimmune means that u cannot prevent the virus..or anything which attack ur body..In fact it will become worser<br>  even<br>  a normal cold can make her so weak even dead...if its already so bad,u must take her to the hospital because of it.<br>  i have friend who have lupus too...<br>  and..<br>  to be honest..normally the one who have lupus,will be dead at the end.<br>  having family and kids is such a great thing!!!<br>  ur gf's mom is so strong..<br>  as long she is healthy and eat the nutritious food,she will be good..<br>  btw, the sufferer normally cant stay under the sun so long..<br>  hope it helps...|`|umca7pwoaa	Sounds like there is a good chance that she could have it too if the majority of females have it. Also, men can get lupus. <br>  <br>  Lupus is a autoimmune disorder and it affects each individual differently. Some forms of Lupus (such as discoid) are a lot less devastating than systemic lupus which is what your friend's mom has.  <br>  <br>  There is a medicine called Plaquenil (sp?) that is supposed to be good for patient's suffering from lupus flares. I can't say that it will prevent her from suffering from it as no medicine or doctor could guarantee that. There is no cure for lupus currently, and hopefully that will change. Why hasn't your friend been tested if is do prevalent in her family? The earlier treatment begins the better.<br>  <br>  Does your friend's mom draw SSDI? Lupus should qualify her as a disability and if she has SSDI she could qualify for medicaid/medicare to help with medical coverage.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to all involved.
415675685ba42d09964394dea4a2dc04aa	I work in a lab doing this stuff all day, and while they are a little out of the normal range, it's not really that bad.  The only think is your mono's are a little high, that's the only thing that really stands out to me, and really they aren't that bad. The other ones are so close to being in that it may just be an acute thing. <br>  <br>   So if the words high and low are stressing you out, don't be, sometimes people just don't fit into the categories as well as we'd like them too but it doesn't really mean anything horrible.  <br>  <br>  But then again, since I don't know what your symptoms are and your doctor does, something might stand out to him that fits your symptoms.<br>  <br>  I hope they figure out what's wrong!  Best of luck|`|XoDUTquWaa	They are all reading either high or low. I don't think that would be in the category of normal. I think your doc should explain these results to you.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	You need to ask your doctor to explain the results.  Explaining the results to you in a way that you understand,  in terms of your specific symptoms, is part of his or job.
Ve6RAuq3aa	obiously the stupid doctors that went to medical school for 7 years should go back and do it all agin.....<br>  <br>  for crying out loud if they are happy for him to have those medications then let him have them...there are pretty much no long term effects of ibuprofen or paracetamol ....infact there is nothing to worry about if the doctors gave it the okay....over a couple of days he might take something like 2 grams paracetemol ?? i know long term users that take 4 grams a day !! they are in fine health apart from chronic leg/arm/neck injuries|`|zjtxKpLqaa	Well the MRI results shouldn't take that long to come in... what 2 days 5 days max? That is not long enough to cause problems. Most other pain meds would probally cause more damage. And other pain relief methods might not take away enough pain
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Valerian, it will make the child sleepy but it will help with the pain. On a camping trip a friend of mine sliced his hand open with a sharp knife there was no way to get him back soon enough to get it treated. I had some valerian capsules with me, I busted them open made a paste with some clean water and slathered it on, in less than 5 minutes it numbed his hand. Buy some at WalMart $5 a bottle give him/her a half dose 300 - 700 mg and see how it works. If she/he does fall asleep don't let him/her sleep on that shoulder. It'll knock you out like that.|`|fZgoUty4aa	kids dont want alternative pain killers they want pain killer from the dr or hospital or go to boots ...he or she will want alternative meds when he grows up and can make his own mind up about them but now he just needs pain killers not an alternative mother|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	To withhold painkillers from somebody with a dislocated shoulder is tantamount to torture. This child should receive proper painkilling treatment as soon as possible - anything less is child neglect/abuse. <br>  <br>  There is no alternative pain relief to pain relief!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You try having a dislocated shoulder without any painkillers then see how much fun you manage to find during the experience.|`|MPbB0ri1aa	Take the child to the emergency room now. They will take care of the pain there. <br>  <br>  This is not the time for waiting for hospital attention.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	NO.  Don't torture your kids, just do what the doctor says, it's only temporary.|`|btCc2CRNaa	rub some dirt on it|`|O7EfZow0aa	you can use aswaganda powder mixed in milk given at two times a day|`|CcffGmqTaa	use Tylenol it is a semi pain killer but not a blood thinner like other forms of pain killers.
NrrIDQlIaa	not personally familiar with aiws but it does say that it can be due to psychoactive drugs like dxm so it might be if you took cold type medicine the reason you experienced it...just a thought...not sure as to how long research has accumulated on this so that might be what you need to know, we dont even have a clue as to the longterm effects of most meds today so just depends on the research...
GLep5H8naa	No...not really.<br>  But, you might learn to become more comfortable with your body. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I think of how I want my body to be or I get jealous of really skinny, tiny girls. But other times I look in the mirror and I think I really don't look that bad, I actually look pretty good. Especially compared to all the obese people, especially women, who seem to be becoming dominant in our society. It will probably never completely go away, but you can learn to become more comfortable in your body.|`|gK2hn3jAaa	No it doesn't. It goes for a while when you're so happy you can't think of anything else, but then when you've caught up with yourself and look in the mirror you'll see imperfection. The feeling is always at the back of the mind and resurfaces each time you see someone that u think has a perfect body or is much skinnier than you. You just have to fight that urge to not eat to go back to old ways even though sometimes it seems like the only answer and the only thing that will make you happy...|`|Amf1wtJmaa	No.  You will always face it every time you look in the mirror.  It's a matter of knowing in your mind being healthy is more important... But if the feeling ever gets to be consuming talk to someone so that you don't fall back into the rut of anorexia.|`|qFf7jliLaa	Never...|`|AA10683267	no, it doesn't.
ND1nFEWSaa	in the very beginning it can help a little with momentum|`|nUi6Y7HWaa	By keeping them planted firmly on the ground, if you start to wave and kick them while you are benching you lose energy and balance. It is always best to keep them firmly planted and to not move them at all while benching.|`|mJgA4IKtaa	usually the position of you feet determines how well you life and how you lift|`|nnaqMgYRaa	keeping your feet on the ground lets you push off a tad when using your whole core body to get the bar up. you would have to use your abs when pushing off with your feet. hard to explain|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  You don't have to use your feet to aid bench press. There is no point in trying to lift more than you can. You run the risk of Injury. You will get more benefit  if you isolate other muscle groups.
9UfJHW8Saa	You are growing calluses.<br>  It's normal<br>  Happens to everyone.<br>  After you play for a bit they get so hard you won't feel it.|`|AChIbAPFaa	Yeah i get that too. It goes away after playing for a while. Once your done playing try icing your fingers it usually helps me.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  Kain|`|lWnHa1jtaa	It happens to everyone. eventually your skin will be much thicker on your fingertips and you won't feel it.

DlH6n9PNaa	I feel like I can relate to your problem. I am 20 and have come to the conclusion that my life has become pretty pointless. I have no friends, and I go to school for business marketing. The other day I felt like I was wasting my life away. I haven't had a real relationship and I have no social life. but its weird because I am actually really nice and funny. I am not ugly either. I decided to drop my classes for this semester and try and find myself, but its not working as well as i thought. I am unemployed which is a first and spend most of my time trying to find a job, which sucks. <br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you because like u I dont know what to tell myself. When u figure out the answer let me know lol <br>  Good Luck with the sole searching|`|4ctXdVNraa	Those are questions that only you can answer. Talking to a professional therapist/psychologist about your problems couldn't hurt, though.
10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	It does sound like ans STD, like warts or herpes. You should have it checked out by your doctor though, especially before you have sex with someone else.|`|bf5cDEyZaa	I doubt that this would be an STD, they sounds more like sebaceous cysts and they are harmless.<br>  Do not pick, push, squeeze or bother them, they will go away on their own.<br>  You can find info on them here:<br>  <a href="http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/dermatology/a/sebaceouscyst.htm" rel="nofollow">http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/dermato...</a><br>  Best of luck!|`|MfIz3TPVaa	go to your doctor, you may have contracted an std ,be safe not sorry.

You may need tests run to see if you are having problems with your gallbladder, bile ducts, or perhaps liver or pancreas. The doctor will do blood tests, possibly an ultrasound, or further studies to see what's going on with you. The color of your stool is important info for the doctor, so please make sure the let him or her know.
BwJOeHDEaa	benadryl will help them go away while the medicine is in your system, but hives are an allergic reaction to something (duh, im sure you already knew that) so you just have to think about any new things that you have come in contact with in the past few hours, i was getting hives really bad a few weeks ago and couldnt figure out what it was, so i went to the dr and he wanted me to make a list of every new thing that i came in contact with..it was the jacket i got for christmas...i had it washed and everything too, so who knows..but yeah...i do know that hives will come soon (like within the hour) of you coming in contact with something

eooUzAfzaa	You seem like a healthy weight for your age, but I know what you mean.  Don't cut out all junk food, that will only make it worse.  The key is moderation and portion control.<br>  <br>  Water is great.  What I do before I eat a meal is have a snack like an apple.  It gives you something in your stomach, so when you do eat, you won't eat as much.<br>  <br>  Just keep doing what you're doing, you'll be fine.  :)|`|leHQQX4paa	The best thing to do. is to eat healthy and give yourself 1 day of the week to eat whatever you want. I dont mean go crazy and eat 30 chocolate bars or anything. but just to help your craving. this will help you lose weight better also. because that one day will trick your metabolism then when you go back to eating right it will work faster.|`|9oRgTCjKaa	You can lose that weight fast and easy on the wu tea diet.|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Eat less.

KC5vBg4uaa	You ask too many questions but I'll try to answer as best as I can.<br>  <br>  1.) If he doesn't die, then I'm not sure, but he certainly will feel the pain after the effects wear off.<br>  <br>  2.) Of course there will be a wound, he got shot.  It doesn't make your body deflect bullets.<br>  <br>  3.) That's not a question...<br>  <br>  4.) pot, hemp, ganja, chronic, dope, herb, cannabis<br>  <br>  5.) Smoked or eating it<br>  <br>  6.) smack<br>  <br>  7.) Not sure, but yes, I believe they are both narcotics which eliminate pain.<br>  <br>  8.) Crack is smoked, cocaine is snorted.  Crack is a rock and cocaine is a powder.  They are both very similar drugs derived from the same plant, the coca plant.  I don't know any street names for crack, but for cocaine there's blow, dust, and powder.<br>  <br>  9.) Yes.  Crystal meth I believe is usually injected and crack is smoke.  Also, meth is more addictive according to what I've heard.  I believe they have similar effects.<br>  <br>  10.) I think speed is a nickname for meth.  And they are both temporary but can have long term affects on the brain from abuse.<br>  <br>  11.) I don't know.<br>  <br>  Why do you care so much?  Just use wikipedia if you need to know.|`|fAKKv0ytaa	Just go to this website to learn everything about any drug:<br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/</a><br>  Too many questions dude.
9pLdhuBnaa	You can try something like Tylenol or Advil to see if that is of some help, but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they recommend.
AA10939092	You have the flu. Get something that will unclog your sinus'. That's the pain you feel behind your eye.<br>  I also like mucinex..it gets the mucous out of your lungs and nose.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Hard to say what the exact trouble is- although I would bet it's a blocked sinus.  Try your favorite over the counter sinus relief medicine, or try applying a hot washcloth to that side of the face, and be sure you get it over and below that left eye.  That should help get it to drain, and draining will relieve the headache.  If this doesn't work, and the headache and nausea are getting worse, then the chance is good it's a migraine type headache.  The pain relievers can help, but won't relieve those entirely as a rule.  You can try a cup of coffee or tea for the caffeine content, that will help it or make it worse depending on the type of migraine it is.  Migraines usually require a doctor's help for pain relief.  Since you don't have fever, it's not likely due to infection like a cold or such.  Try heat, moist heat if you can, and see if that won't help.  Sip some ginger ale for your nausea.|`|KKh8rikGaa	No doubt, it's a tumor, make out your will|`|C9d1Q4JOaa	That sounds like a migrane headache to me.  Take two tylenol and try to go to sleep.  Drink some water also.  You should feel better when you wake up<br>  <br>  You don't have the flu because your body temperature is too low.  Obviously you aren't pregnant, and Sinus headaches don't cause nausea.  (Just letting you know the other answers are incorrect)|`|TaPYUz1Qaa	Sinus headache is usually behind the eyes. Try taking Sudafed-D|`|6x7zV65Xaa	omgz like are you pregnanttt|`|BNEB2AXkaa	It sounds like a classic migraine. If you are having photophobia and scintillations (if noise and bright light) this is most likely what it is. Migraines are usually unilateral (one-sided) and have the nausea and other description you and I have given. Temperature is not elevated so, probably not an infection.
BT5otMrxaa	You need to go to the social security web site and see if you can apply for disability.  There are several kinds.  If you still live at home you might be able to draw off your parents disability, if you have not worked enough years to draw off your own.   Any disability will not be enough to live off of and you can not own a car or own anything over 200.00.  They figure if you can afford things like a car then you don't need there help.  <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssa.gov/</a>
rlWZtKx2aa	it means that you have your period.|`|16bWGB14aa	Nothings wrong it is normal to irregular sometimes.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Nthing, it could happen to anyone. especially because you havent even had it for a year it is even more likely to be irregular.|`|HlXrHd52aa	Probably nothing.  Sometimes it will change (mine seem to change with the seasons sometimes; around the 24th, and then closer to the 15th).  I think "normal" is anywhere between 21-35 days.|`|n5TwQt9Oaa	it just came a little early this time. aren't you luckyyy.
xCAbKKIOaa	uh i think u could use it there since ur gonna be there all day|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	Yes, although the internet might not be free, or it might be locked.  Ask your doctor about getting the password for the internet so that you can watch porn.... or check myspace.|`|nAe0sYrsaa	why don't you call the hospital and see what the rules are..
rU7ZjIHKaa	Not that strong, but when you use that stuff, the amount of adrenaline and other chemicals pumping through your body can allow you to lift things that you normally couldn't lift and things like that....it also makes you want to jump off buildings because you think you can fly, or kill people because you think you are god and they are evil. Probably shouldn't take the stuff if you are planning on it.<br>  <br>  I see you asked how much stronger? Well, you won't be able to lift a bus or anything, but lets say you got up the morning before and did 10 pushups...and that was the most you could possibly do in one setting. On PCP, you could probably do about 20-25, as your heart explodes and you go into cardiac arrest.|`|OUXO6g6Laa	PCP won't make you any stronger.  That's just some bullshit thrown around by bad cops so they don't have to go to jail.  In reality, it just makes you less responsive to pain.  You can still feel and be aware of pain, but your brain won't tell you to stop when you get hurt.  This is similar to what's commonly called retard strength.  Contrast this with hysterical strength, which is the real "super human" strength that allows women to pick up cars and such.  The trick there is that muscles are actually much stronger than can normally be seen and if you flood the body with adrenaline, muscles can work closer to actual physical limits.  Adrenaline will also block pain, of course.<br>  <br>  In either case, serious and permanent damage to the body is a distinct possibility.
zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like you have the signs of being pregnant. why not get a home pregnancy test.|`|16bWGB14aa	You could be pregnant or maybe you are just stressed out or have changed your lifestyle.|`|GH1nqOCkaa	Stress can cause a missed period and also a change in your diet, or if you've started to exercise more, that can also cause a missed period. It could also just be a bit late, if maybe you've started the pill or just got off it? There are many factors, I would wait till next month, and then go see a doctor.
QueLLNiraa	Yes I do.<br>  <br>  I suffer from Narcolepsy which is annoying as it affects me when I sleep. I often re awake during the night and find it hard to get to sleep.<br>  <br>  I can easily answer why it happens.<br>  <br>  Sleep is important as it allows our body organs to rest and heal itself after being used in the day, if you don't get much sleep your brain lacks from resting thus that's why you can't think and solve problems.<br>  <br>  Reason why you want to collapse is because your just physically exhausted, you haven't allowed your body to rest and recover enough.<br>  <br>  Dry mouth is probably because your salivary glands aren't working or that your large intestines aren't absorbing as much water because it's not functioning at full speed.|`|upx2bF4Waa	Yes, I do experience this...and I'm having hard time to concentrate on what I'm doing. When I started to learn the meditation technique even though I have lack of sleep (sometimes) I still preformed well with my job.|`|dODaX6tTaa	yes it happens due to lack of sleep a person should get atleast 8 hours of sleep a day ..|`|zFsBCsiCaa	i work better under 5 hours but once/twice a week i sleep 10 hours so the rest becomes possible|`|ctYtbbNUaa	I find I can do without sleep, as long as I lay off the caffeine. <br>  I usually get about 4-6 hours a night and I survive fine off it, but if i drink coffee, or take no-doze or even coke, I usually feel like crap the next day. Especially the collapsing part, weak limbs and trouble with problem solving. <br>  <br>  drink lots of water, i think it helps. also a cool shower or freezing bath.<br>  <br>  <br>  get better soon,<br>  -MC out|`|BSU9pNUWaa	You need more sleep. There's no mystery to this question. People who are deprived of sleep can easily lose concentration and can make themselves physically sick. Get those seven hours!|`|C2qdLfKdaa	yup|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Of course...(that's why Meth is so insidiously damaging...the lack of sleep...)<br>  <br>  The drug meth by itself, does little to damage you...<br>  <br>  It's the almost total lack of sleep and nutrition that causes people to lose control of their minds and health while they're on meth...<br>  <br>  Going even a few days without food or sleep, compromises your immune system immediately, and within days you're beset by all kinds of problems, especially a dramatic and ominous reduction in your mental faculties...|`|rb8OGnmZaa	Yes.
DgAOboZNaa	I think it could be <br>  a) pregnancy<br>  b) flu, or some other sickness<br>  c) i am not sure.<br>  Talk to a doctor or nurse.|`|DlH6n9PNaa	Pregnant.....see a doctor|`|A2g3mUF5aa	is it posssible you could be pregnant?
QifRHwuiaa	so i can too .. its nuthing just dont go too much into it . mayb ur eyes jjst dont dry up that quickly or sumthing since thats why we blink in the first place . so yeh dont be worried lots of ppl can|`|8exFeT64aa	Things like this have happened quite often. <br>  maybe its because your used to having your eyes open and you have a good eye water supply so you dont need to continuosly blink in order to get more water to kep your eyes from drying out|`|1LMVZHPyaa	You're turning into a cat.|`|dLlI92OWaa	consult a doctor.<br>  or you are satan lol|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Maybe, consult your doctor.
XIzYgpYsaa	Think about it!!!  You will probably have kids someday.  You wan't to make a great life for them right???  You don't want to only have 10 dollars at a time, working somewhere minimum wage.  Your grades are probably falling because you, umm, aren't going to school or trying?!?!?!  I don't know.  I'm in 7th grade, and I hate school too, but I'm in all advanced classes...just knowing that someday, when I have a family, I will have a great degree, a great job, and a healthy family, and be able to supply all their needs.  =]<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|jJjfeylmaa	it is good to go because if you fail, it will only result in you going to school more in the long run! if your 14 your probably not in high school right? so your grades at this point don't count anyways, just try to pass and then in HS you will have a fresh new start.
z5JkgFOyaa	Glands inside a girl/woman’s vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when a woman is breastfeeding or when a woman is sexually excited.<br>  <br>  Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem.  Some other types of infections such as yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis can also cause discharge that is usually accompanied by odor such as beer/yeast/fish.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you have any of these signs or any concerns regarding this you consult with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and for proper treatment should you have anything other than just a normal vaginal discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|50WCN0graa	It could be a yeast infection. The white "cottage cheese like discharge" (sorry for the word choice), is a classic yeast infection symptoms. If that is what it is and you don't treat it, then you will probably get some itchiness and maybe painful urination.<br>  <br>  You can go to the doctor to get a pill. Or you can treat yeast infections over the counter..... there is a whole bunch of medications at the drug store... most of them are suppositories, though (you insert cream vaginally before going to bed... it is a little messy, but not too bad). I think there might be an over-the-counter pill now, too, but it is probably more expensive than the suppositories.<br>  <br>  If you have taken an anti-biotic or are on birth control, it is not uncommon to get yeast infections as a side effect.|`|4adEwhkZaa	White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  A normal vaginal discharge consists of about a teaspoon (4 ML) a day that is white or transparent, thick to thin, and odorless. This is formed by the normal bacteria and fluids the vaginal cells put off. The discharge can be more noticeable at different times of the month depending on ovulation, menstrual flow, sexual activity and birth control<br>  <br>  It is not uncommon for the normal discharge to be dark, brown or discolored a day or two following the menstrual period. <br>  <br>  The things to be worried about include if the discharge has a yellow or green color, is clumpy like cottage cheese, or has a bad odor. If worried, see a doctor.|`|bMaa3bk2aa	Do you have your period?<br>  If not, then that's why.<br>  DIRECTLY before my period, about 2 to 2 weeks before, I would get the same thing you are.<br>  It's normal, completely normal, so don't worry.|`|jJjfeylmaa	yea that's pretty normal, happens to me a little bit when my bf and i have sex a lot? lol its just a weird thing about our bodies i guess..

It's like running on the ends of your toes and the whole back of your calf hurts and stiffens instead of the muscles in your feet. Try to do some light stretching with the leg and ice it off and on.

I'd go to the doctor as soon as possible.  It sounds very much like an injury I had in the early 90s playing football.  I was the kickoff return specialist on my team, and as I fielded the ball to return the opening kickoff, it squirted out of my hands...I reached down to pick it up while at the same time positioning my feet for a return, but just as I picked up the ball, I was popped by an opposing player.  My right foot landed awkwardly on the ground, trying to find leverage, but that unfortunately put the weight of both players--mine and the defender's--solely on my right ankle.  I felt a loud pop and thought my foot would be dangling, broken--I looked down and saw my foot was still in one piece.  But when I tried to walk, I limped severely and a rush of pain went up my spine.  It was the first play of the game, so I didn't want to quit right off the bat.  I decided to play quarterback for my team instead of in my usual spot as wide receiver, that way I didn't have to run so much.  My team got pummeled in that game, and we were down by like four touchdowns; so guess what?  Silly me decided to come into one play as a receiver.  We had to use a flea-flicker to get the ball to me, as I was slowed down terribly by my injury.  The running back threw the ball to me, as I was wide open, but he threw the ball high; I had to jump for the ball and I did catch it, but as I came down I landed right on my hurt ankle, and this time the pain was like three times as much as when I first hurt my foot.  But did I just drop down in pain?  No--I was so pumped with adrenaline with the prospect of scoring a touchdown that even with a severely sprained ankle and about three defenders running after me, waiting to pounce on their wounded prey, I limped, hopped, skipped all the way to the endzone--just barely making it ahead of them.  As soon as I was safely in the endzone, though, I dropped to the ground in pain, as I couldn't take it anymore.  But at that moment as my teammates surrounded me, I was more happy than I was hurting, as I had proven to my team that we could do it, even against the odds.  We did wind up losing the game, though, but I felt good that we had at least tried.  My right ankle, however, wasn't too happy:  It was the size of an orange by the time I limped home.  I couldn't walk right for about two or three weeks, and I never did see a doctor about it.  Sometimes, when it's rilly cold in the winter, I can feel a slight stiffness in that ankle.  But I am proud of that pain--or at least the memory of it.  To this day I still don't know how I scored that touchdown in a limp with three guys running full speed after me.  I must have been running like a wounded jackrabbit.|`|AA11707728	The muscles connected to the tendons that insert on your ankle run up the side of the leg.

SQLSOeHcaa	EXERCISE AND MELATONIN  ( ONE PILL BEFORE YOU GO TO BED)<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  "Using Melatonin to Treat Insomnia"<br>  Melatonin is another natural choice to treat insomnia that is also proving to be safe and effective, at least for short-term use. <br>  <br>  Your body comes equipped with a biological clock that regulates sleeping and waking activities. Melatonin, a hormone naturally produced in the body, is believed to help keep the clock ticking by regulating what's known as our circadian rhythm cycle.<br>  <br>  Traveling across several time zones disrupts that rhythm, and the result is jet lag -- that feeling of exhaustion and disorientation you get when you wake up the next day in a strange hotel room. What may help in those cases is using melatonin to treat insomnia the night before.<br>  <br>  Our bodies produce melatonin in the bean-size pineal gland nestled deep inside our brains; it is also produced in the retinas of our eyes. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and shuts down in the presence of bright light (especially sunlight). Normally, the pineal gland starts increasing its melatonin production around 9 P.M. Hormone levels peak between 2 A.M. and 4 A.M. and then return to their normal daytime levels.<br>  <br>  Exactly how melatonin works is unclear. At a worldwide scientific gathering in Switzerland in 1997, Dr. Peretz Lavie reported that electroencephalograms taken during secretion of melatonin are similar to those induced by ben--zodiazepine drugs such as Klonopin. But melatonin in no other way resembles benzodiazepines, according to a study that appeared two years earlier in the journal Psychopharmacology.<br>  <br>  Infants produce a great deal of melatonin. But after we reach puberty, our melatonin levels begin to decrease. As we grow older, the pineal gland calcifies, resulting in a further loss of melatonin.<br>  <br>  By the time we're elderly, melatonin levels are quite low, perhaps accounting for the fact that so many older people suffer from insomnia. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that melatonin-replacement therapy may be beneficial for those people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Melatonin Studies<br>  <br>  Researchers gave a group of elderly insomniacs melatonin and found that the hormone significantly improved sleep maintenance, compared with a placebo.<br>  <br>  In another study, 35 elderly insomniacs were given either 2 milligrams of melatonin or a placebo two hours before they went to bed. The groups were tested for two weeks. Those taking melatonin reported the most improvement in sleep patterns.<br>  <br>  In a 1995 study in Israel, older people with sleep problems were given melatonin two hours before bedtime for seven days. Then researchers monitored the subjects' sleep and wake patterns. Melatonin, the scientists concluded, was effective for improving sleep maintenance.<br>  <br>  A study in the journal Lancet suggested that controlled-release melatonin may help older people to stay asleep. Israeli researchers asked 12 people in their 70s and 80s, all of whom weren't producing enough melatonin at night, to take either placebo tablets or tablets that slowly release 2 milligrams of melatonin. After three weeks, the melatonin takers were falling asleep somewhat faster, waking for shorter periods after falling asleep, and spending more time asleep.<br>  <br>  Still other studies have confirmed previous reports of melatonin's efficacy: <br>  <br>  <br>  A 1994 trial reported in the journal Neuroreport found that melatonin helped insomniacs to fall asleep nearly two hours sooner than usual.<br>  <br>  <br>  A 1995 study in the European Journal of Pharmacology showed that melatonin even improves napping. Young adults were treated with 3 to 6 milligrams of melatonin or a placebo. Those taking melatonin reported that they were able to get to sleep sooner and stay asleep longer than placebo-taking subjects. The melatonin group members also assessed the quality of their sleep as "deeper" than normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ten healthy young men were given tablets containing fast-release melatonin, controlled-release melatonin, or a placebo at 11 a.m. In the afternoon, they were asked to take naps. Those taking melatonin reported that the supplement helped them to fall asleep more quickly and to sleep better than usual.<br>  <br>  <br>  Researchers gave melatonin to 225 insomniacs and monitored their progress. Within three days, the subjects receiving melatonin reported significantly better quality of sleep and a feeling of "freshness" in the morning. <br>  One metanalysis (a review of multiple studies that treats all the data as if it were part of one large study) did conclude that melatonin is ineffective for jet lag. However, this metanalysis was biased by a few negative studies. Still, the study found melatonin safe to use.

People who eat more Carbs actually lose weight so eat stuff from animals and stay away from bread and pasta and things like that i would come home and have an apple or a cheese stick or something but then at dinner you really wanna have meat and maybe veggies on the side it will really help you lose weight but be filled up at the same time|`|ttDPF4o0aa	Oh baby dont get aborexic by losing 40 pounds outtaf ur 140.<br>  i think it depends it might work, night not. Depends on your body structure and habits.<br>  Diets are so relative things
7pkxOc6Raa	You're not going to gain 30 pounds of lean mass by the end of May...ESPECIALLY if you're trying to lose fat at the same time.|`|3ERx4opSaa	Eat: protein bars, meats, fish, eggs, nuts, yogurt, beans and lentils.<br>  <br>  Do: Bench presses, Shoulder presses, seated rows, crounches and bicep curls.<br>  <br>  and also dont forget treadmill cardio.
862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	108 is underweight for your height. Your only option is to eat more(make sure it's healthy foods too! Lots of PROTEIN!) Try exercises to build muscle mass.
Yv52TEt9aa	Yes, it can be counterproductive if you do it too often. Bench press primarily works your chest, so you only want to do bench on the days that you work your chest. And you shouldn't work your chest any more often than you do the rest of your body.<br>  <br>  Try a workout like this:<br>  <br>  Day 1 Chest and Triceps<br>  <br>  Day 2 Rest<br>  <br>  Day 3 Back Biceps<br>  <br>  Day 4 Rest<br>  <br>  Day 5 Shoulders and Abs<br>  <br>  Day 6 Rest<br>  <br>  Day 7 Legs and Glutes<br>  <br>  <br>  You have to give your muscles sufficient rest and nutrition to recover from workouts.

No big deal.|`|2eztcCO0aa	You should be okay.  But try taking your pills at night instead of during the day.  People's routine changes from day to day, which makes it hard sometimes to remember to take your pill, but everyone pretty much does the same thing when they go to bed, no matter what time they go to bed  Add your pill to your bedtime routine and you won't forget it.
7KAtbf9xaa	Here's some info I found.  My dad had toenail fungus too.<br>  <br>  The Best Tips to Curing Nail FungusNails must be kept clean and dry always and breath fresh air. Nail fungus naturally occurs on toenail. Some reason is wearing shoes that are tied too tight, wearing shoes for a very long time can cause your feet to perspire and build fungus. Borrowing of nail cutter and other tools from other people might also cause you the transferring of fungus, because if the user has fungus infection it might get to you. Trauma can be one of the reasons for its cause. If one of your gets injured it allows the bacteria to get in. Those people with low immune system have a great chance of getting this disease. Once it occurs in one toenail it spreads to other nails at the same feet.There are mild and aggressive kinds of medications. It can be treated in the traditional way, self treated, or it can be doctor prescribed. Most probably it is much to be preferred by doctors to guarantee the effectiveness and safeness of the treatment. Some medicines can cause side effects especially on those people who are suffering from liver diseases and can also cause allergies because of its high toxic contents. People who have depressed immune systems like those people with problem in their circulatory system, Diabetic people, elderly people and those who have HIV.  Medication for nail fungus is a long-term treatment. Awareness in preventing it can minimize its risk to preserve your healthy nail. It takes almost 3 months to be done. In three months, while your nails grow, the medicine applied prevents the fungi from growing, bringing back the healthy nail.Curing Nail fungus has its success rate at 60–80 percent and it is not assured that it will not occur again. In fact it has a 15 percent chance to reoccur.Nail Fungus is a long lasting kind of infection. That is why after treating it the doctors still recommend their patients to continue the use of anti-fungal creams. This is to prevent another build up of fungus infection.The best way to keep a healthy nail is to keep your hygiene always. To prevent fungus infection we must follow some certain methods. The first is, wear open footwear as much as possible. Second, change socks immediately if it becomes damp or wearing absorbent socks is more preferable. Third, don’t wear high top boots if not needed. Fourth, Treat fungus as early as you can to stop its spreading.For more information visit the source link.
MR4ijaBuaa	Actually, it's not that bad at all.<br>  <br>  Some athletes have really low heart rates. This means that whenever they are competing, their heart is only working at about 80-100, making them have huge advantages in physical activities. <br>  <br>  If you're not already, you should get involved in sports!|`|a4IR6tYqaa	a resting rate, especially after sleeping, of 48 is not a problem, especially if you are young, in good health, and physically fit.

CTVkz71aaa	Too many symptoms, you sound like you should be on House. you could have mononucleosis. Flue wouldn't last this long. The pain in the back and neck is worrying. I think you'll have to suck it up and see the doc. Remember to drink a lot of fluids so that you don't dehydrate from the diarrhea. Hope you feel better soon!|`|q2cuRzaKaa	I can't be sure. The symptoms you've listed can account for quite a round of infections and viruses, so I've narrowed it down to just a few. And remember, nothing seems serious at first. I strongly suggest visiting a doctor. <br>  <br>  Diarrhoea, headache, and neck pain can indicate:<br>  -chemical poisoning<br>  -meningitis<br>  -viral meningitis
z5JkgFOyaa	Having irregular or missed periods can be caused by a number of things such as significant weight gain or loss (although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems), over-exercise, poor nutrition (or a diet too high in carbohydrates), smoking, certain medications, caffeine, excessive alcohol use (interfering with how the liver metabolizes estrogen and progesterone), eating disorders, increased stress, PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome or estrogen dominance), uterine abnormalities such as fibroids, ovarian cysts, polyps, endometriosis and hormonal imbalances.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you consult with your doctor/gynaecologist for further evaluation to see what they think could be causing this if you have missed your period for more than two months.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|leD79ZAyaa	stress?...sudden increase in exercise?|`|xpftUFMKaa	If you are an older woman it just could be your body changing into an "older lady". <br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  It could be if you started exercising excessively. that can mess with your periods (trust me I know lol). <br>  <br>  but if you think it is neither of these ALWAYS check with your doctor.<br>  it is the best thing to do.|`|FC8x4bgjaa	you could have a lot of inflamation in your stomach or some other condition many diseases side effects include women loosing their periods, or you could be loosing weight and you just dont notice|`|DIZ0dFxraa	this sounds scary, but cancer can cause this. dont freak out. i'm sixteen years old and probably watch too much house.|`|ded7fdac4b59b508c4c35606747c7633aa	maybe PCOS-google it

If you're not doing it properly or using cream/gel not designed for sensitive areas, you'll always have the shaving rash.|`|TzlNjkCQaa	Those little red bumps might be STD.  Then again, they might be secret valentines left behind by an alien romeo from the planet hygene.|`|jQ2S9ru4aa	You really need to see a proper doctor
gEkLQWF4aa	when you say it happens when you get "just nervous" as well, so this sounds like anxiety to me. When I got anxious, my heart rate would go up, which can cause feelings of a hot flash. You feel like your skin is on fire and it itches like hell.  I don't think it's a skin disease because it happens when you get hot and sweaty and nervous. Sounds like anxiety. Go to a doctor and tell him what's been happening. He can prescribe medicine which will stop the anxiety. (it is a chemical imbalance in many circumstances that can be controled)<br>  Had to edit that last part I said...didn't realize you were male. :P|`|90yjyha0aa	I had this problem, too.  Whenever I would play soccer and get really hot/sweaty my skin would start to itch - kind of like a sharp sting/itch.  I figured that it was because my skin was fairly dry so I started using strong moisturizing lotions every day and eventually the itching disappeared.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	ok..this sounds crazy, but i get that too, and i read in womens health a few months ago that its an 'exercise allergy' (dumb, i know) i cant remember what they said caused it, but if you go to the dr, theyll give you a cream/lotion to rub on you and it will go away<br>  i have it too, and its weird, bc it doesnt happen all the time, and it doenst only happen when its cold, or if im wearing shorts, idk what was causing it..i thought it was my thighs jiggling haha..but i went and got a hydrocortosone type cream and it fixed itself..|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Could be anything from bug bite to allergy.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	It could be a medication you took......Years ago when I used heroin it mad me itch at times too|`|g6sCUoO7aa	Could be Hives.

683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	You may increase your fore play sufficiently until you get fully aroused and driven into an uncontrollable desire, insisting your bf to proceed  further in the sexplay, and his action at that stage may certainly help you to feel your orgasm coinciding with his cummingclimax!<br>  Secondly you may try to enjoy sex in various different positions with your bf at different times which may also help to take you to your desired orgasm.|`|SrMt01nOaa	Having an orgasm is all about your mood and stimulation of the clitoris. <br>  <br>  No it doesn't "happen out of nowhere," you climax, meaning you build up to it.<br>  <br>  You will definitely know when you have an orgasm or "cuum."<br>  <br>  Climaxing is like going up a hill in intensity and pleasure, then the orgasm is at the top and its like WHAM!<br>  <br>  You'll definitely feel it.|`|YNkdm9q4aa	yeah very weird. Well it takes a while, but you'll never have one unless you being sexually actived or having any sexual incounters, No matter how many times i had sex i never had one neither, sometimes its real tricky, you have to know what your body like. Then maybe it'll happen, just experiment<br>  <br>  but on the other hand, the best way to fine out if u cummed is if your wearing a condom and it feels like he cummed in u but didnt, its ur's then lol|`|QRpE4Tbdaa	You're probably too young. <br>  <br>  I haven't either. through vaginal right?

Amf1wtJmaa	No - cardio exercise burns fat faster than weight lifting.  Burning fat is about keeping your heart rate up over a period of time.  And that's exactly what the cardio workouts do.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Weight training is key to burning fat since muscle burns fat. Many people think you can only build with weight training and that is not true. You can lose using weight training just as well or better than cardio. I am living proof of it. Especially if you use giant setting, super setting, and tri-setting. These are intense forms of weight training that require you to have no rest between sets.<br>  super set= two sets back to back<br>  tri-set = three sets back to back<br>  giant sets= four or more sets back to back<br>  <br>  This means no rest whatsoever. Most weight trainers wait a minute or more between sets. However, with these techniques no rest at all be ready to jump to the next set quick asap.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	In the long run, yes.  With weight training you build muscle (something you don't do with cardio, no matter what other people might say).  For each pound of muscle, you burn an extra 75 calories a day.|`|OzK10hKxaa	Yes, or so the olympic teams lead me to believe.<br>  <br>  If you do cardio alone, you are burning muscle as well as fat.<br>  <br>  But if you lift such as, 3 reps of a high weight, then switch to 7 reps of a lower weight, no rest in between, you will burn more fat than muscle.
iK3YYRaTaa	yes. But only 250 mL. It is on the high side of low glycemic load. <br>  Go for it.

gULNGNkFaa	I'd say if you have the opportunity to talk with a professional therapist about this it could be very helpful. There is no doubt a reason as to why you feel the need to control the situations you are in. Maybe you can figure out what you are concerned about? It's often hard to really understand ourselves without an outside person helping us to see what makes us tick. The fact that you've asked for help is a good sign, and lets me know you want to work on yourself. I wish everyone was this way :o). It takes lots of baby steps to try to overcome areas we struggle with, but it is doable. Give yourself a break, and pat yourself on the back every time you make an effort to let things, which aren't so important, slide. You can make yourself crazy worrying about controlling everything. It's really an impossible task.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	WATCH FIGHT CLUB!|`|upx2bF4Waa	You need to control your feelings...Try to learn meditation and it will help you.

361dd3949c69e539c3ee64de86ebc3a3aa	Roxanne- Coke and Tomato Soup are not sufficient nutrients for you.<br>  I am assuming you're a minor, and thus still growing and developing.  It is important you have the proper foods to live a healthy life.<br>  Now, you may not be eating this little intentionally but it does not matter because if you cannot get yourself to eat more you definitely have an eating disorder- whether it be anorexia or some other illness. <br>  <br>  Talk to your parents, your doctor or someone at school.  Start eating healthier!<br>  You need fresh fruits, vegetables and PROTEIN (meats, eggs, tofu, beans, poultry, fish)!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11530601	that IS anorexia. Being thin isnt everything. Just accept that you have other qualities than your looks and work on those. Yes I do sound harsh but I have suffered from Bulimia in the past and the only thing that helped me was realising that looks werent everything.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	If you eat only this, love, then it's an eating disorder. Anorexia is when you starve yourself, so yes, this is quite likely to be anorexia. I would say it's not a case of 'leading to' anymore, I suspect you are already there. <br>  <br>  Your friend doesn't mean to call you names or anything, but for people who love you, it's very frightening to see this. It's possible your friend doesn't know how to help you. You need to talk to your parents about this, and you need to go to a doctor to get professional help. <br>  <br>  And don't worry about how long it takes or how much it costs. Your health and well-being matter, if your friend is worried then I am sure your family will be worried also. It's important to them that you are in good health and not anxious about things. Really.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Well, I don't know how skinny and tall you are, or how much you weigh, so therefore it is hard to tell if you're underweight. I also don't know if you're on the road to anorexia since you are still eating and drinking something with lots of sugar. But I CAN tell you that you're on the road to being extremely unhealthy, and other than the tomato soup, you aren't getting any essential nutrients. I don't know what kind of diet this is that you have in mind. You should be getting the correct amount of servings of fruits, veggies, whole grains and sources of protein each day, as well as drinking lots of water. If this is really how you function each day, then I am truly worried about you. Not about being anorexic, but about something more serious happening. I certainly hope you change your dieting habits for the sake of your life, as soon as possible. Good luck!|`|GzTKjDc8aa	That is a very unhealthy diet.  You need protein, fruits and vegetables and whole grains.  It does sound like you're on the road to anorexia and you are certainly on the road to being sick, as you're not getting the nutrients you need.<br>  <br>  Find foods you like that are healthy and not fattening.  Egg whites, salmon, tuna - all these are low calorie and good for you.|`|M1ZNk8Vhaa	Yes you are pratcially leading there!|`|NPpalf1Gaa	That's just unhealthy.. and yes can lead to anorexia if you get use to not having any solid food in your stomach.<br>  <br>  That can of coke everyday is extremely bad for you.. especially since it's practically the only thing you have everyday. All that sugar will turn into fat and since your not eating any solid food your body will go into starvation mode and store all that fat away, this also causes your metabolism to slow down which means it is harder to burn off that fat.<br>  So yes, this is leading to anorexia.. very unhealthy and unsatisfying lifestyle I can tell you by experience will not benefit you health wise or mentally.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for ways to lose weight, you need all the vitamins essential to living a healthy lifestyle and for your body to be in it's best condition to lose the weight.|`|QoOx93PPaa	That practically IS anorexia.

yd6iUJs1aa	weird symptoms to be honest, well i'd suggest drink alot of water to get whatever you have out of your system.

Your body is suppose to have some sort of mass to it. It's especially hard for teenagers on how much to weigh and being comfortable with yourself. It's a proven fact that the more you check the scales, the more you gain! Isn't that crazy? Eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner with moderate porportions, be active, and just be healthy. Just keep reminding yourself that those people who thing rib bones sticking out is hot are idiots. :D

That will make them think you're trying to sleep off and illness. Try to get so warm under the blankets that if they touched you you would feel flushed and hot. You might want to research a cold or flu in order to get the facts right. But, try to be very convincing. Keep it simple. Don't do the soup thing the other girl mentioned! It's too risky! They could find the can, or know you faked it somehow then you would never get away with faking it again! <br>  <br>  Good luck tomorrow either way. and if you have to go to school try the nurse.

If there is nothing else that she will understand, she will definitely understand about your period. When you're a teen and are new to periods it can be really embarrassing to talk about it. But the fact is, periods are a fact of life. I am in my late 20s and have never used tampons. I feel more comfortable wearing pads and so do. One thing is for sure, you need to make sure that you stock up on pads (and tampons if you use them) as well as pain relief (if you get pain). <br>  <br>  As for dancing tomorrow, I would take a couple of pads / tampons along with you and then during bathroom breaks, change them so that there is less risk of leaking.

whyW8VhZaa	Your best bet is to go back to the hospital and explain the problems that your dad is having to a neurologist.  Ask about brain imaging, and whether they think that would be necessary or helpful.<br>  <br>  Sometimes after a concussion or a night of heavy drinking (or both, in this case) it does take a little while to become fully normal again.  But if it has taken over a week, or if it hasn't been progressing, you need to speak to a specialist.  There could be damage to the frontal lobe of his brain; has he had any changes in personality?  I imagine he is irritable due to all the frustration, but has he been irrational or otherwise very different from normal?  If this is the case, then you should definitely see a specialist, because there could be permanent brain damage (or there could even without it!)<br>  <br>  I do hope that things get better, and that your dad recovers.

AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Never ever go for any type of Diet pills or any drug which claim that it will reduce the weight quickly. Taking Diet pills will kill u.<br>  23) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor Exercise is skipping.|`|jpF5rd2Paa	run, run run run run|`|A5bQbI3faa	The obvious way to burn fat is to eat less food and workout more, the difficulties arise when we actually aim to put that into operation! There are a lot of opportunities to fail in the big wide world don't you think?! The only thing that really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I lost twenty five pounds, it really does work!
rvoo4rBjaa	There are many reasons a feeding tube is needed, have they tried thicket  it tends to thicken up any liquids so that they are not aspirated into the lungs? they usually try this first before resulting in a feeding tube? My hubby and I have worked with kids that had them and some kids have pulled them out by accident and there is  risks but all in all if they are necessary then  they do pretty well.Being on his tummy will be fine  as long as he doesn't do it during a feeding, and after the healing of the tube being inserted there isn't any pain and minimal discomfort, they get very use to it and don't pay much attention. It depends on the age also and the handicaps but I have made one piece jump suits for adults to keep them from pulling at the tubes and they worked great. God Bless

Tkkc3Wasaa	Basically, in order to see your abs you will need to first burn away the abdominal fats that is covering your abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  Burning fats involves doing a a full body workout instead of just doing exercises to target your abs.<br>  <br>  Also, you will have to monitor your diet everyday. Try to have a diet of 5-6 small meals each day of calorie content of 500-650. Avoid starving yourself before your next meal as there is a high chance you will exceed the calorie intake for the meal when you eat on an empty stomach.<br>  <br>  The calorie intake each day depends greatly on your Resting Metabolism Rate (RMR) which can be calculated using the formula :<br>  <br>  For male : [66 + (12.7 x height) + (6.27 x weight) – (6.8 x age)] x Workout Intensity Factor.<br>  <br>  For female : [655 + (4.57 x height) + (4.36 x weight) – (4.7 x age)] x Workout Intensity Factor.<br>  <br>  Where weight is measured in pounds<br>  and height is measured in inches.<br>  <br>  The workout intensity factor varies according to how much you workout. Give yourself an intensity factor of 1.3 ( for non active people ), 1.4 ( for moderately active) and 1.5 ( For very Active ).<br>  <br>  For a person who workout intensively 4-5 days /week, he is considered as very active.<br>  <br>  Once you know your RMR, you will be able to monitor how much calorie intake you need per day to lose or gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  The next thing you will need to get your 6 - pack abs would be a good workout program.<br>  <br>  Try to commit yourself to your workout program up to 3 times per week. Any session more than 3 times each week may lead to over-training and this will be counterproductive towards obtaining your abs.<br>  <br>  For your ab-training exercises, try to commit to just 2 times each week with each session lasting for about 10-12mins. Similarly, any session more than this will lead to over-training.<br>  <br>  A few good ab exercises would be ab bicycles, ab scissors and ab crunches.<br>  <br>  With a good diet and a good workout program , i am sure you will be able to see progress in your abs in no time.<br>  <br>  Hope this clears your doubt<br>  <br>  Cheers <br>  <br>  Alan|`|FaVYRoXqaa	what in the world are you willing to do then?

You fell very unstable, have a bad self image, have trouble w/ relationships(of all kinds - family freinds, dating) - you sometimes do just about anything not to be left alone. You have bouts of major anger - for no reasons(so it seems to every one else).  - You think the world of your best freind then she has to go on a trip, hangs out w/ other freinds - anything , really, then you cant think anything but bad about her.

They say to do the same thing with tatoos so i guess that stuff is just good for your skin.  Definitely wear some sunscreen next time your out and keep applying since your sweat washes it out.

b6b5aa29dfa8be870640deffe6d927b6aa	Well actually I heard that it takes longer for you to return to fertility after being on the shot. I was on the shot for 1 year and I did not like it! In that one year I had my period twice (not spotting) my full blown period. Then It took me 3 months to get my period and that was only becuase I took the pill to make it regular. <br>  I also got an abnormal pap that I am seeing the OBGyn for.

You may feel a bit more numb and spacey, but then again if you have a baby to take care, that's really not a good idea. It could be depression based upon having your hormones be unbalanced after giving birth, but it's also likely you are depressed given circumstances of having learned about someone cheating on you I assume it's the baby's father, but then again, I can't really tell here. Whatever the cause of your depression, it sounds like you need help, sooner - rather than later. Do whatever you can to find a therapist to talk to, and work through these struggles you face as a new mother. Being a mom is hard work, and it forces you to grow up really fast.  Medication may be very helpful to you, in the way of an antidepressant, but I strongly urge and encourage you to find a therapist. Medication  may help with the overwhelming feelings you have, won't help you come up with coping strategies in your life as a young parent of several children. Good luck to you, and congratulations on your baby. Also, please take care of yourself in this matter regardless of what you think your parents may think in terms of judging you.

Changes are usually seen much faster than other medications.  If you have not seen changes from your ADHD medication within 2 - 4 weeks I would let the doctor know because maybe you would either need an adjustment or change in medication.

GoNCzxAuaa	You have a second degree burn.  Avoid putting lotions on it, and take a few aspirin or another NSAID to relieve swelling and pain.  Apply antibiotic ointment, as the skin's natural bacterial barrier is weakened.  <br>  <br>  Drink LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER!  When your skin is burnt, the skin no longer acts as a barrier to keep water in.  Large quantities of water are lost, and it's very easy to become dehydrated with a burn.  <br>  <br>  If the burn is larger than 2-3 inches in diameter, you need to see a doctor.  They can do far more than you can do at home.|`|EZkKZtGxaa	aloe vera, its great, it may smell strange but it will stop the stinging and may help with the blisters.|`|9m0dh4YOaa	ok first ALWAYS wear sunblock if ur gonna be out in the sun for a long time. now the blisters can mean that some deep skin layers and/or some nerve endings have been damaged so basically like a second degree burn (im not saying this to scare u) but u should get that checked out. as for the stinging try a gel type aloe vera that u should be able to find at any store by the sunblocks. hope this helps n that u feel better!!

I would go to the dermatologist so he can properly diagnose you because I can't see your scalp. <br>  Good luck!|`|mTFfFZCnaa	Rather than rub yourself raw, try these treatments for itchy scalp.<br>  <br>  Banish the bar. Never use a cake of soap to shampoo your hair, says Ron Renee, president of the Aestheticians International Association in Dallas. Not only is it harsh on hair, but it also strips the scalp of essential oils, which can lead to itching, he says.<br>  <br>  Do the right shampoo. "You really need a pH-balanced shampoo to keep your scalp from flaking and drying, a common cause of itchy scalp," says Renee. Look for one that has a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5, he says. You can check the pH level of your favorite shampoo by using nitrozine paper test strips, which you can buy from pharmacies, he says.<br>  <br>  Have an antihistamine. Some antihistamines used for allergies contain anti-itching ingredients that may provide temporary relief from itchy scalp, says Robert Richards, M.D., a spokesperson for the American Academy of Dermatologists with a practice in Toronto. Among the best are Benadryl and Chlor-Trimeton. Because each contains a sedative, both may be helpful with an itch that's keeping you up, he says.<br>  <br>  Sleep on it. "If you're looking for an over-the-counter treatment for scalp scaling, there's an excellent product called Baker's P and S Liquid," says Dr. Rietschel. Apply it to the scalp at bedtime and put on a shower cap. The next morning, clean your hair with a dandruff shampoo.<br>  <br>  Spread on some olive oil. "Olive oil does seem to have a soothing effect on some cases of dry, itchy scalp," says Dr. Rietschel. Just massage warm olive oil into your scalp and wait ten minutes before you shampoo.<br>  <br>  Make a date with your dermatologist. "You're going to need a higher level of care if you don't begin to get substantial relief within about a week," says Dr. Rietschel.<br>  <br>  Stopping Psoriasis<br>  <br>  Don't get sore at psoriasis, get even—with these remedies.<br>  <br>  Give psoriasis a scrub. Coal-tar based shampoos, while messy, seem to work best at removing the dead skin and reducing inflammation that accompanies psoriasis on the scalp, says Dr. Rietschel. "If you deal with the inflammation, then you are dealing with the itching," he says. You should see results within one to two weeks; if not, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Cut the itch with cortisone. If eczema or psoriasis-induced itching continues after shampooing, reach for 1 percent hydrocortisone cream, an item available in most drugstores, says Dr. Rietschel.<br>  <br>  Hairdos and Don'ts<br>  <br>  It's also entirely possible that while you were trying to develop the latest hairdo, you may have committed a hair don't: You exposed your scalp to several chemicals that triggered an allergic reaction, causing inflammation and itching. Or you may simply be using the wrong kind of products to clean your hair. Consider these tips when caring for your hair.<br>  <br>  Test your hair-care treatment. Home hair dyes often contain para-phenylenediamine, a chemical that's been linked to severe scalp itching and blistering. "Once you've had the contact, that's enough for the immunological process to run its one- to two-week course," says Dr. Rietschel. To avoid an allergic reaction, test the dye on the box as directed before using, he says.<br>  <br>  Drop your acid perm. If you've ever experienced severe itching 48 hours or less after getting a salon perm, avoid glyceryl thioglycolate, a perm activator and common irritant. Because the chemical stays in hair even after frequent shampooing, some eczema sufferers have been forced to shave their heads to get relief. "It's really difficult to deal with," says Dr. Rietschel. "Avoid it if you can."

dTiWVBT7aa	Hi, I had acne from when i was 12 and tried every single kind of medication and noting worked. I had a healthy diet etc etc. The ONLY thing that ever worked for me was accutane. After taking it only 1 week i could see amazing results. It was a miracle drug for me. At first i was scared to go on it because of all the side effects (which were bad) but i would do it all over again. My skin healed up beautifully. Now i was depressed but i was already depressed in the first place and dont feel that it got worse because of the drug. I guess it is different on every person though. But i do know a couple of people that were on it and had to stop because they couldnt handle the side effects and depression but like i said, its different for everybody. But i would strongly reccommend it!!!|`|ELZfN4hzaa	I'm 18 and still have the wretched stuff. I just got done with a two month cycle of Minocycline (the max dosage) and I'm also on Retena and Duac.

I totally understand where you're coming from, there are days where I wish I had flawless skin. I'm sick of popping pills and being on strict diets just so I can look a certain way. If you want to go on Accutane and you truly think it will make you happy, then go for it. But fair warning, my brother was on it and he still has breakouts. It also takes a toll on your body. Best of luck, hope everything works out for you!|`|G07o0cHPaa	Try Proactive.

aNlT1NRqaa	It's hard to judge, but I would say overweight and bordering on obese. I was overweight & had to get out & exercise, but if you eat junk & drink sodas, you could work out 4-7 hours a day, just to stay the same.<br>  <br>  Cut out all sodas, no fruit juice (sugar), no restaurants (huge servings, lots of fat), and no creamy deserts.<br>  <br>  Start walking everywhere you can, use the stairs instead of the escalator. Go to the gym & use the aerobic machines and start lifting weights. Muscle burns more calories, even while sleeping. If you drink coffee or tea (tea is great for you - regular, not miracle teas), don't add milk, cream, or sugar.<br>  <br>  Don't try to lose the weight fast. If you make a lifestyle choice instead of dieting, you'll lose the weight & keep it off. I list 45 pounds 5 years ago & (except the muscle weight) I've kept all but about 5 pounds off since.<br>  <br>  Also, go see a doctor.

mTFfFZCnaa	Oedipal complex (a child's attraction to the parent of the opposite sex) is common during adolescent years.The complex is named after the Greek mythical character Oedipus, who (albeit unknowingly) kills his father and marries his mother. According to Freud, the Oedipus complex is a universal phenomenon, built in phylogenetically, and is responsible for much unconscious guilt. Speaking of the mythical Oedipus, Freud put it in these terms:<br>  “ His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours –- because the oracle laid the same curse upon us before our birth as upon him. It is the fate of all of us, perhaps, to direct our first sexual impulse towards our mother and our first hatred and our first murderous wish against our father. Our dreams convince us that this is so.[5] ”<br>  Classical theory considers the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex to be developmentally desirable, the key to the development of gender roles and identity. Freud posited that boys and girls resolved the conflicts differently as a result of the male's castration anxiety (caused by oedipal rivalry with the father) and the female's penis envy. He also held that the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex could result in neurosis, paedophilia, and homosexuality.<br>  Classical theory holds that 'resolution' of the Oedipus complex takes place through identification with the parent of the same sex and (partial) temporary renunciation of the parent of the opposite sex; the opposite-sex parent is then 're-discovered' as the growing individual's adult sexual object.<br>  In classical theory, individuals who are fixated at the oedipal level are 'mother-fixated' or 'father-fixated', and reveal this by choosing sexual partners who are discernible surrogates for their parent(s).|`|whyW8VhZaa	The Oedipus complex has been almost entirely discredited, and I don't think it was what you were asking about anyway.<br>  <br>  What you are describing sounds like a pattern of insecure attachment.  Sometimes when a child is either neglected, or just anxious by nature, he or she will develop separation anxiety as a toddler.  This usually resolves (at least mostly) by the time the child is school-age.<br>  <br>  So, you are most likely looking for Separation Anxiety, or Insecure or Ambivalent Attachment.  It isn't technically categorized as a disorder, although it could perhaps be a type of obsessive disorder or personality disorder, especially if coupled with other symptoms.<br>  <br>  In adults, most theories of attachment are focused on romantic partners, rather than the parents, but it might be possible for this kind of thing to still be an issue.

ivH8tRtsaa	Hard to say in a definite way. Ovulation (The dropping of the egg into the uterus) happens a week before your period starts. A liner is formed in the uterus of mostly blood for the dropped egg to attach to after ovulation. Its sort of like a nest for your egg. If after a week the egg is not fertilized, The liner in the uterus breaks down and passes through the cervix and vaginal opening. The unfertilized egg is also passed.<br>  In your case, you have no way of knowing when you may be fertile or not. I am no doctor, but I would say you have a low risk of getting pregnant because your uterus is not making a very welcome nest for the egg. If you do not suffer from cramps or any of the other familiar symptoms associated with a menstrual cycle, then you may not even be ovulating (dropping an egg). The problem in your case is that you never know when your female organs are going to get it together and start working properly. If your luck is like mine, it'll be the first time you decide not to use protection. You just can't be for sure in your case unless a doctor examines you and finds a problem that would definitely prevent you from getting pregnant. I know this answer doesn't answer anything for you, but there's just no way to be 100% one way or the other without a medical examination. Hope this helps. Use protection until you know for sure. Have a wonderful day.|`|pr5TKgtCaa	Some women hardly ever have much of a period, I'm sure you need to have had a period prior to conceiving.|`|PImvmP1paa	If you have sex when you are ovulating, most likely.|`|HpwevWYlaa	You people need to pay attention in sex ed! <br>  <br>  Unless you're anorexic you should have your period.

CHCPnvksaa	Take potassium pills or eat a banana (they're high in potassium) before working out. They will prevent cramping. Also make sure you stretch before you work out.|`|hLosmqqGaa	It's possible there has been some previous damage to these muscles you were not aware of. Be sure to stretch completely before each workout, add some flexibility training, and be sure to warm up properly before high-intensity use of those muscles. The goal is to make sure enough blood (i.e. oxygen and nutrients) is reaching all of your muscles during the work out... so a warm compress applied to the area before the workout should also dilate the blood vessels and lead to more efficient delivery of oxygen, which might avoid cramping.<br>  <br>  These are just best guesses though... it's something I would personally try if I were in your situation anyway. There are also NSAIDs like advil (ibuprofen), aleve (naproxen), or asprin (ASA) that if taken an hour before your workout could reduce the pain to a more bearable level but they can cause stomach problems with long-term use; it's probably best to avoid drugs if at all possible. It may be advisable to use them for a short period as the muscles become accustomed to use, but there is also the possibility of over-exerting yourself, perhaps even dangerously, if you are not able to perceive pain as readily as usual. Just be careful if you go that route, and if you start to become dependent on them to get through your workouts, you're probably working too hard.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|CKktV8sfaa	You might just be starting your workout too hard for your body. That's why your calf is hurting. Slow down on the treadmill and see if that helps....<br>  For every workout session you should warm up which can be like 10-20 minutes of fast walking/jogging on the treadmill,anything that warms your body up. Then I would recommend to stretch while your body is 'warm' so you don't pull anything. Go on to your workout, and when you are done and cooling down, be sure to stretch those muscles that you worked out. This can help prevent muscle cramps and pain.|`|mTFfFZCnaa	In a patient with a painful swollen calf the first diagnosis to consider is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but there are other possibilitiesInclude overload; running too much<br>  track speedwork; or a series of very minor twists on rough<br>  trails. <br>  Many calf muscle problems are resolved by use of a heel lift in all shoes<br>  and regular stretching. Some people say avoid walking bare?<br>  foot; others say walking barefoot will stretch the calf muscle to its<br>  ideal length. <br>   The gastrocnemious muscle responds well to ice, strains more<br>  when running up hills; and you may recall from the stretching page, it requires a nearly <br>  straight knee to stretch it.<br>   Because the soleus is under the gastroc, it’s less amena?<br>  ble to ice therapy.

Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and anti–inflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.<br>  <br>  Narcotics didn’t help my pain.

AA10246871	I wouldn't be hanging out with them much. And I'd tell the friend that I thought they were shallow, and that's why I wouldn't be spending as much time with them as I had in the past.<br>  <br>  Committed love has nothing to do with weight, or acne, or hair loss, or illness, or poverty, or anything else, and to assume so is not only petty, it's ugly.<br>  <br>  I have a nephew I care about, but I distinctly remember the day I stopped loving him. He had been married to his girlfriend of years and years for about six months. She had stuck with him through good times and bad. She had put up with him working rotten jobs to make time for his rock band, and had often taken a second job so they wouldn't lose their apartment. She had been completely and entirely supportive of him. Twice he bought her an engagement ring, and twice she gave it back because he needed money for something for the band. She gave the ring back without complaint, and it was returned to the jewelry store because they buy back the stuff they sell for a very good price. In all honesty, when he needed to get some major repairs done on his guitar, they ate nothing but rice and beans and bread for a month. She made a lot of sacrifices for him. So we're at a family gathering, and she was in the kitchen, and he was telling me that they had made a professional demo, and it was making the rounds in California, and several of the songs were getting some airplay on radio stations in the Los Angeles area. It was looking a lot like they might get a real contract. I said to him, "It will be nice if you can finally get signed. You can start making some money, and you'll be able to give her a lot of the stuff she's gone without in the last six years. You must be looking forward to that." He looked me in the face, and he said, "Aunt Bron, I want to tell you something completely true and honest. If we get a record deal, and I start making money from my music, the first change I am making in my life is getting rid of her. It isn't that I don't love her, because I do. But she's short, she's plump, and she's not exactly a beauty. If we get a record deal, I can get a really hot woman. I would rather have the hot trophy on my arm, even one I don't love, than have to take her around and have people see who I am married to." I just looked at him in shock. I mean we locked eyes and stared at each other for at least three minutes, with neither of us looking away. I finally said, "Are you playing with me, or are you being serious?" He said, "I am being 100% serious. I would rather have to pay her astronomical amounts of alimony than have someone think I cannot get a better woman than that, because if we get a contract, I will have my pick of hot women." I turned around and walked away. I went about 100 yards away, and as I was walking, I realized there was this funny hole in my chest all of a sudden. I couldn't figure out what it was until I started crying. It was a hole where my love and affection for him had been, because I had really loved him a lot. And poof! It was gone. And I knew it was gone because I had never in my wildest dreams imagined he'd be that shallow. <br>  <br>  Later he came up to me when I was standing by myself, and he asked if I was angry with him. I told him the truth--I wasn't angry, I was disappointed. I couldn't believe that he'd throw away such a long and seemingly loving and committed relationship because of such shallow reasons. He said, "I love her like she's a part of me. She's my first real love, and I will always love her more than I can say. But I can do better in the looks department, and if I do, it will help my career." I told him I didn't want to talk to him about it anymore, and that was the last serious time we talked. We've talked casually, but there's a big chill between us, and as I said, I no longer love him. <br>  <br>  They did get a record contract. And right before they were supposed to go into the studio, their bass player, who had substance abuse problems, almost killed himself with oxycontin. They tried a session bassist, but because he hadn't been playing with them all along, the music didn't sound right. It took a long time for the bassist to get sober enough to be able to record, and the record label finally bought out their contract. They had a tour scheduled, and they needed new talent to support their headliners. Part of their plan was that the new bands had to have their CDs out and available in stores before the tour started. They missed their shot at stardom. And while I am sad for him, I am also kind of glad. She may not know what would have happened to her, but I do, and she is really too sweet and gentle and kind to be dumped for something as petty as that.<br>  <br>  So that's that. If a friend asked me that stuff, I'd tell them they were ugly and petty, and that I wouldn't be spending much time with them anymore. They clearly don't understand what love is, and I, for one, don't need people like that in my life.|`|YkBb5y98aa	Your question confuses me on the way it is worded, if you are saying that the person who is getting surgery is leaving the other person, I would say that that is wrong.

nMtywIOHaa	Sleep is a complicated thing. Apparently over one quarter of Americans have the same problem and take sleeping pills as well.  This dilemma is partly because we as Americans don’t respect the importance of our sleep and want a fast and effective way of fixing a problem. Sleeping pills are not a long term solution. <br>  <br>  To help you with your problem it may be a lack of education into what causes you to sleep. I’ll try to give you some information, tips, and hopefully a possible solution.<br>  <br>  Circadian Rhythm:<br>  You body goes in a 28 hour rhythm controlled by your brainstem that controls heart beat, body temperature, a lot of other things, and sleep.  Most importantly to you it controls our sleep by the modulation of body temperature.  This is why you feel hot at night and cold in the morning or if you stay up for too long you may feel different temperatures.  Your body feels hot at night because when you’re your body is ready to go to sleep it starts to lower your core temperature and uses your body as a type of radiator in order to release that heat.  The same thing is in the morning; your body temperature may be cold as your core temperature is trying to heat up. <br>  <br>  You may want to try lowering the temperature of your room at night and heat it up in the morning. This will allow for your body to release that extra heat easier and to help it into that comfortable stage.  Also make sure to go to bed at the same time every night.  This will help your body to adjust when it should go to bed.<br>  <br>  Melatonin:<br>  Melatonin is a natural hormone that is created inside of your pineal gland during the night.  It is controlled by the amount of light that enters your eyes, so when you close your eyes the production starts; when you open your eyes it stops. Melatonin is a very potent sleep aid because it is one of the main reasons our body temperature lowers as well as it having other sleep properties.  The production of melatonin naturally requires precursors (stuff that is turned into melatonin), a neurotransmitter called serotonin.  Serotonin has many different precursors as well found in many different kinds of foods, but unfortunately many foods that we eat today are low in these precursors. Many people will agree with me that malnutrition is one of the main causes of sleep deprivation today.  Not only does malnutrition cause sleep disorders but it also supports the cause of many mood disorders.  Many psychologists will give people medication that deals directly in either raising the amount of serotonin in the brain, or helping reduce the breakdown of serotonin to ultimately have more. <br>  <br>  The only way to get these precursors to serotonin is to eat healthier or take supplements that are precursors to serotonin.  This would help in the production of melatonin and help you sleep, however it’s hard to tell you if you are deficient in serotonin unless you go to a doctor.  Also I do not recommend taking melatonin supplements since not much research has been done on the possible build up of melatonin in the brain.  I always recommend the more natural way if anything. Also since light is a huge problem for the production of melatonin, make sure to turn off excess light or wear  eye shades when sleeping, this will help with the production of melatonin and help you sleep.<br>  <br>  The Cholinergic System versus the Aminergic System<br>  According to the Activation Synthesis Hypotheses created by Dr. Hobson and McCarley, REM (an phase of sleep) is caused by the Cholinergic (REM on) and Aminergic (REM off) system.  These two systems are controlled by the release of certain neurotransmitters in the PONS and cause different sleep phases.  The aminergic system is made of (what I consider) the main ingredient serotonin and the Cholinergic system, acetylcholine.  This balance either pushes us to sleep or keeps us away from sleep.  If there is an imbalance of the neurotransmitters of serotonin or acetylcholine we either experience an absence of deep sleep (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM).<br>    <br>  If you have an excess amount of acetylcholine it can cause issues with you trying to sleep.  You may feel energetic and unable to stop thinking about things.  To help with this imbalance you can either support your system with more serotonin or help try to balance the system out with what is called an MAOI (not going to explain how this works) like Saint John’s Wort. <br>  <br>  Before going out and buying a bunch of supplements, stressful situations during the day may also create you problems to sleep, and focusing on relaxing may help with overcoming them.  You should read some books on relaxation.  It’s important to know that everything in your brain is a chemical reaction and your mind has a huge amount of power to control what types of chemicals are released.  We can help our mind on the problems we have with eating good and getting a good amount of exercise.  Those are things that should worked on first in order to help out body before introducing medication o|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Besides warm milk you can find other remedies in web searches for "natural sleep aids" and "natural sleep remedies".|`|p9rMlaTdaa	I have the exact same problem... I think I may have found the solution:<br>  - Drink warm milk before going to sleep.<br>  - Take one or two crackers and put peanut butter on it. (Peanut butter makes your body tired)<br>  - Try listening to orchestra music, not Rihanna, Britney Spears... ect. Don't listen to music with words, because when  the song will be playing, you'll know the words, which you have to use your brain to remember the words, and when you have to sleep, your brain must not work or think, it must be relaxed.<br>  <br>  Try this every night before going to sleep. If this does not work, I suggest you go talk this with a doctor. He'll lend you some medical pills for you to take so it'll make your body very tired, for you to take your chance to finally sleep. Please keep in mind that these pills can cost you a lot of money. I hope my answers helped you.<br>  Good luck, and reply to me if it worked or not.<br>  <br>  -      Nick, from Australia.     :)

2sycPf8Daa	The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves. They all can be the source of the pain felt in the chest. <br>  According to your description, the cause of your symptoms is more likely to be due to:: <br>  - Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura (the membrane covers the lung) , which is a double-layered membrane covers the lungs separating it from the rib cage. The condition gradually improves with rest, plenty of fluid.Non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs can help reduce your chest pains. <br>  <br>  - Overexertion of the chest wall muscles (spasm) or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain. <br>  <br>  Viral infections like flu, are the most common cause of pleurisy. The pain is felt as sharp pain which get worse by coughing, sneezing, moving and deep breathing. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub. <br>  <br>  I advise you to follow up with your doctor, only by a complete history and a physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.<br>   <br>  Take care as always!|`|AA10953999	Coughing can give you chest pains, also the fluid buildup from being sick may also be a cause of your pain.
t9Nw86Plaa	Alright, here's a serious answer:<br>  <br>  Every month, fertile women release an egg from one of their ovaries (the place where the eggs are stored and mature). While this egg is waiting for a sperm to come and fertilize it, the woman's uterus prepares for the fertilized egg - the uterine lining becomes thicker, and has a large blood supply (this is so that, if the egg DOES get fertilized, the uterus will be prepared enough to support the embryo and provide it with nutrients). However, if the egg is NOT fertilized within a certain amount of time, this thick uterine lining is not needed (since there will be no embryo to support that month). The uterine lining is shed (it exits the body through the vagina - this is the menstrual 'period' you see... basically the woman will bleed for a few days until the uterine lining has been shed), and the cycle starts again... over and over until the woman reaches menopause!|`|dPNmuXfDaa	its cool. my guyfriends ask me the same thing. A period is when we "bleed" from our vigana. we get our peroid once a month.|`|IctjROTIaa	A period is when a females uterus(place were the baby is kept during pregnancy) expels and pushes out a lining made of blood and tissue.  This lining was built up in the females uterus in case she became pregnant.  And if she does not become pregnant her body can sense through hormonal messages that the lining is no longer needed and the lining is released from the uterus and the blood and tissue passes out through her vagina. This passage of blood and tissue (period) usually lasts between 3-7 days.|`|7BvXLBW6aa	Yeah I just showed my little sister man, let me tell you as simple as I can<br>  <br>  Once a month women bleed horrendusly from their vagina.  It's a wonder they all aren't dead, only some die from how much blood they lose.  Make sure your girlfriend is careful when you two have sex, and try not to disrupt the bandaid's when it's that time of the month, you may send her to the hospital from blood loss|`|pr5TKgtCaa	The period is the 'monthly cycle' every month, approximately the same time for most, a womans womb disspels, via her vagina, the blood and unfertilised eggs.

uFRIsdC7aa	BOO GO TO SEE A DOCTOR .|`|AA12266052	Hypertension is sustained elevation of resting systolic BP (≥ 140 mm Hg), diastolic BP (≥ 90 mm Hg), or both. Hypertension with no known cause (primary; formerly, essential hypertension) is most common. Hypertension with an identified cause (secondary hypertension) is usually due to a renal disorder. Usually, no symptoms develop unless hypertension is severe or long-standing. Diagnosis is by sphygmomanometry. Tests may be done to determine cause, assess damage, and identify other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and drugs, including diuretics, β - blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and Ca channel blockers<br>  You have got Stage 2 Hypertension. Diastolic pressure is very high.<br>  Conduct Kidney function tests (Such as microalbuminuria, serum creatinine, BUN etc.) Also check the function of your heart and retina (eye).<br>  High blood pressure increases the heart's workload. Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down. Without treatment, symptoms of congestive heart failure may develop.<br>  Hypertensive retinopathy is damage to the retina caused by high blood pressure.|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do pranayam as suggested by baba Ramdev in Aastha channel some time high BP is due to overweight so reduce if you are overweight .you can take Muktavati by Patanjalai yogpeeth (Ramdev baba ) for high BP it do not have any side effects and allopethic medicine also is stopped with it if taken for some time .|`|O23x96t5aa	There are two types of Hypertention.  One is Essential Hypertention which is the commonest which comes usually after the age of 35 and there is no specific cause for it.  Not much investigation is necessary for this other than usual tests for sugar, kidney, cholestrol, heart etc and patients are put on tablets which is continued life long.<br>  The other type is called Secondary Hypertention which comes usually before the age of 30 years.  In this type, Hypertention comes secondary to some other problem in endocrine system, kidney, suprarenal, heart etc.  So any patient who gets High Blood pressure before the age of 30 years are investigated for potential causes of secondary hypertention.  If found it may be cured by the treatment of the primary cause.  If no cause is found on investigation then it is treated like secondary hypertention.<br>  As you have consistant high BP since one month I think it is time for you to have detailed check up for secondary hypertention.  Have a check up with your physician who will advise you regarding the investigation.<br>  But first a few points about checking hypertention.   Don't rely on home checking machines for your BP check up.  It is mostly wrong.  Always check with a mercury sphygmomanometer which most doctors use in the clinic.  You will need somebody who knows how to use it to check your BP. Or go to your clinic and have the nurse check it with the apparatus once a week.  Always rest a while and be calm before taking your BP. <br>  Meanwhile you reduse salt in your diet.  Try to reduse weight if you are overweight.  Stop smoking completely if you are smoker.  Reduse tension at home and work.  Get adequate sleep at night.  Take good diet with lot of vegetables.  Go for regullar walks and exercise.  These are a few things you can do to reduse BP without medications.<br>  There are no symptoms for high BP.  Whatever you are feeling is not due to high BP.  High BP can only be found out by checking by a BP apparatus.  Hypertention is so aptly called a silent killer.<br>  The long term problems with BP are very harmful.  So whatever the age, if you have Hypertention it has to be treated.   Have your appointment with your doctor early.|`|UFdsU1iIaa	Best advice is not to ignore your BP.

amLzTNeVaa	I'm studying to become a diagnostician and it sounds like your kid might of had some contaminated food or drink (stomach flu). The best thing to do is to keep her as cool as possible and make sure you don't give her to too much medicine. Keep giving the medicine that is directed on the bottle. If she sweats that is good it means the bacteria and germs that's infecting him/her is leaving. The diarrhea is probably because of the contaminated food. But make sure you keep giving your kid water and or gingerale.. iced tea and sugar can contain sugars that build up acid making her stomach even more upset. Make sure she lays down and gets her rest. While shes sleeping her body can shut down and work better to fight the virus. When she is better disinfect all the areas she/he slept on because you can get what she had to. Also a cool bath might cool her temperature.I hope this helps and hope your child gets better. If this doesn't help within 12 - 24 hours see a doctor as soon as possible.|`|HkDUxkS4aa	Hi, I have no idea about kids, but I know if this happend to me, I would take my self to the docs.. the ER NOW!

Give her tiny sips of water consistently if she's vomiting so much so she won't get dehydrated even if she wouldn't want to drink. Don't give her any more milk or gatorade or any sugary drinks as they'll make the puking and diarrhea worse. Just give her water.

Chances are, the second opinion will give you more information.<br>  <br>  Once it is known what it is, you can be treated.  There are many benign things that this could be, btw.<br>  <br>  I hope that you are feeling better soon.|`|qlaZpHnPaa	I wish you well.
pBhbQiMtaa	what are you using to moisturize it. you need to find one that works best for you. trial and error approach. treat yourself to a day at the hair salon and let the stylist know your problem. he/she can probably recommend the best stuff for you to try.. if nothing seems to work go to the doc and see what doc says. it may even be how you are eating

It's important to eat a balance of whole grains (such as the wheatbix and crackers), lean protein (such as the chicken), and monounsaturated fats (nuts are very good for you)!<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates, protein, and fat are the three "macronutrients"--they provide the energy. But vitamins and minerals, even though they have no calories, are also very important. If you are on a calorie-restrictive diet, you may want to consider taking a multivitamin every day to make sure you meet your vitamin and mineral needs. Your meals today look a little low in calcium and iron, both of which are very important for overall health.<br>  <br>  Tip: if you are avoiding red meat, then dark leafy greens (like spinach or kale) are the best natural source of iron.|`|77YWNCV5aa	I'm no nutritionist or anything, but that doesn't sound like you are getting everything from the food group that you need.<br>  <br>  But if you are trying to lose weight quick, this will work.

MPbB0ri1aa	If your grandfather has not seen a doctor to find out the cause of the chronic pain, he needs to do that. It may possibly be a condition that can be corrected. If he already has seen a doctor and been told there is not any thing to help there are ways to help control pain without resorting to chronic use of narcotics and he could discuss those with his doctor to make sure any of them will not make the pain worse.<br>  <br>  I have FMS (fibromyalgia) and chronic back and hip pain that are not from the FMS. Here are some things that I found that have helped me:<br>  <br>  Relaxation and meditation<br>  Listening to my favorite music<br>  Engaging in a hobby I enjoy <br>  (All of the above distract my mind from the pain)<br>  <br>  For my FMS it is also important that I get up and move everyday like walking or swimming.<br>  <br>  For my hip and back pain, my doctor is having me see a physical therapist. I am learning stretches and exercises that are helpful for relieving the pain.<br>  <br>  Massage and acupuncture has helped with my pain, too.|`|RoBCd6tSaa	you mean best medication for chronic pain? there are many medication in the market that offer medication in the market, i think you should get suggestion from the doctor before taking such medicine.|`|AA10373285	I suggest he calls his doctor just to be on the safe side first.

EpOU7vGYaa	naw. only if you inhale it, it affects your lungs, which affects your breathing capability, and then affects your muscles, brain which will screw up your stamina. so, just don't inhale it and you'll be fine|`|sY1itvPkaa	It has tobacco in it just like a ciggarette. Its just a different kind and ciggarettes have nicotine in it so thats what makes ciggarettes addictive.|`|v9rzGYWoaa	No it wouldnt.

PBOWJYQ6aa	You can tell by the size of their feet. If they have big, awkward-looking feet, they are going to be tall. They probably will be, given the gene pool you have going on there. Just feed them healthy.|`|jpMP5p9haa	Honestly, you will have to give more information than that. We would need, your parents, grandparents and your fiance's information as well. I would say at least 6 foot but then again, they could end up being 5 feet tall or 7. It all depends and there is no definite answer.|`|OnfCcikUaa	recent studies show that tall men usually have taller daughters, and tall women usually have taller sons.  You've got the best of both, so I'm guessing your children will be tall, but i mean, there are always exceptions.|`|sY1itvPkaa	They're gonna be pretty tall. I would say from 6'2 to 6'6. As long as they drink they're milk and excercise they will get up there maybe even higher.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Hey, Bubba!  Nobody can tell you how tall your kids will be.  It's all in God's plan - NOT yours.  Want some unsolicted advice?  Don't live YOUR life thru your kids!|`|AA11302074	well the genes are on your side. The problem could be extra tall daughters. It is sort of awkward dating a girl whos taller than you.
VPlKbDplaa	Yes it should help. It has been shown to have some anti-cholinesterase activity. Cholinesterase (otherwise known as acetylcholinesterase) is the enzyme known to inhibit the key neurotransmitter required for memory and cognition - Acetylcholine. <br>  <br>  Other herbs that have anti-cholinesterase activity include the plants of the mint family....Lemon balm, Sage and Rosemary. And also another one is the herb Gotu kola. You could safely take these herbs together. But you should be aware that Ginkgo biloba is one of the herbs known to have drug-herb interactions os if you are on any kind of prescribed medication then talk to a doctor or pharmacist first....including mentioning any family histories of diseases or disorders. <br>  <br>  Also don't forget fish oil as omega 3 can help with memory and make sure you get enough essential fatty acids in your diet. Try to eat oily fish (as a source of omega 3) twice a week. Or take a capsule daily for optimum health. And also there is the Phosphatidylserine (PS) that others have mentioned - its an important brain chemical. Its found in fish, green leafy vegetables, soya beans and rice. Its a phospolipid. Make sure you get enough  Vitamin B12 and B Vitamins in general. Brewers Yeast is a good natural source of B Vitamins. Another supplement worth taking is Vitamin E (400iu). It protects the brain from free radical damage basically. All those herbs I mentioned before all have antioxidant activity too.....especially Rosemary. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|4ac328c2baa1f961e57f293f37f83208aa	I tried it too, and I started to remember things I hadn't thought about in years. I was quiet surprised actually...<br>  I would say from my experiences that it does promote good memory function.<br>  <br>  Give it alittle time...|`|DBaFUtYsaa	Some people feel that it works for them. For myself, I have been using fish oils, for my joints and there has been studies showing that it may help brain functions. Flax seed oils is also an alternate way to obtain the omega 3 oils which are good for brain functions. All of these supplements are fairly safe. Sine you bought the Ginkgo, you should try it and see if you have any results. You may not see results overnight, and it may take some time. Be sure to consult your doctor if you are on any medications as these supplements may interfere with the medications.|`|b7037586581b82e483bcc45bea7734c9aa	Ginkgo has been shown to help people feel more alert and have better memory. There are a number of all natural supplements that would assist with memory. Bacopa Monniere and PS are two others. The best that I know of however is ADD-memory.|`|4818d65e08b64762be5f48d1d6b7ea82aa	No.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Does+Ginko+work%3F" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Does+Ginko+work%3F</a>|`|mCbChkKraa	You need DMAE, NADH and Phosphatidyl-Serin for that purpose.
jpMP5p9haa	You will not have any more changes in hair follicles that I can tell. However, there is no way of knowing how far you have developed, but it is safe to assume that a 16 year old girl has already developed her hair.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You won't end puberty until at least age 21.   All hair follicles sprout, grow & mature - then eventually come out & are replaced by new ones over & over. Ending puberty has nothing to do with it.  As you get older, some turn gray or white.  Just like facial hair - body hair starts out like a 'stubble' & as time passes, begins to grow & mature.
Hq6nSl1Qaa	Huh?  Adenoids are part of the lymph system in the back of sinuses.  Most people are both with them, so the answer would be... "normal."|`|4LsF70cjaa	Everyone has adenoids.  You are born with them.  They are only a problem if inflamed or infected. They are not located in your nose, they are above your tonsils between your mouth and your nose.|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	People with chronic adenoiditis tend to develop flared nostrils after a while.
aEnWEGjCaa	I suggest doing a combination of everything above :)|`|KPBDApiuaa	well that skin is fat.. you probably only need to lose about 5 pounds.. try dieting and cardio for 2 weeks and doing lifting like squats and dead lifts. You need to burn off that fat for your abs to show. Doing millions oof squats is only 10% ofthe way to getting a six pack. You need to workout your large muscle groups, especially legs and your back. So as I said, do cardio and do weightlifting for your legs and back. Also, for cardio it does not have to be running, try boxing or other sports that involve your whole body.|`|ab9d0d9ad5f495e6629d6147a4ea8894aa	You are on the right track.  Sit ups build muscle but they won't burn your fat.  You need to lower your overall body fat.  Interval training is probably the best strategy for this.  There are more total body workouts (focused on abs) at the site below.  Hope this helps :)|`|OnfCcikUaa	just get on the treadmill and do some interval training, or the elliptical, whichever you prefer.  but keep doing crunches and oblique crunches every other day like you're doing.  but make sure when you're doing them that you aren't just lifting your head, you have to PULL UP WITH YOUR ABS!!!!! lol PUMP SOME IRON!!!!! lmao|`|pYAQDXRIaa	cardio..........cardio.........cardio<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh yeah and do some cardio<br>  <br>  =P<br>  <br>  but on a serious note building abdominal muscles is great and all but without doing cardio all is your doing is building muscle under fat...thus making your stomach to appear bigger (and not in the good way) so burn that fat off and blam 6 pack. i think you have to have like less that 6% body fat or something like that for it to show =/|`|sY1itvPkaa	You need to do situps everyday until you can't even stand upright cause your abs hurt so much. I would say that a healthy diet with a little bit more protein from meats that aren't fried or cooked in lots of oils. And drink milk too. As for that flab I think its water weight that you can lose by running. If there are no results on the flab in a month or so I would talk to a a doctor about it and ask them how you can work it off with out surgery.|`|yEDR0fnOaa	Do crunches instead of sit ups. They are more effective than sit ups to build your abs. Then you meet your goals sooner.<br>  Watch your diet also. You say you are pretty skinny, but it wouldn't hurt to be sure you're eating a lot of protein. Stay away from carbs and sweets. Even one of those could sabotage your plans.
umGi6gTcaa	Skitzo your paranoid, like there was this lady near my school who said her father was Martin Luther King (she was white) she yelled that we were trying to kill him/her so she'd whip out her cell phone which she thought was some futuristic ray gun and she'd shoot lasers at us...lol going  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZap! For a while she talked to me, warning me that I needed to shield my thoughts because ppl were listening, then all of a sudden she started moaning about ppl trying to kill her dad.<br>  <br>  Bipolar ppl ride an emotional roller coaster, they have other symptoms but that's the main one. I know of 2 bipolar ppl that insist there syndrome makes them last longer in the sack but that's just bs.|`|c21f52f98718e01558380e0e7fac21cbaa	Schizophrenia is often confused with BiPolar but they are both very different. <br>  <br>  Bipolar Disorder is a mood disorder.<br>  <br>  Schizophrenia is commonly characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality. It most commonly manifests as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking with significant social or occupational dysfunction.

They need to look for things like swollen blood vessels and stuff.<br>  <br>  If it smells, which.. you know. Not like you can smell your own .. well anyway, it could be a fistula. Which requires surgery because it wont heal properly. To help your pretty much limited to- clean yourself constantly- dont' just wipe after number 2. Clean off with water. Clean with antiseptic soap. Take ibuprofen. And use a warm compress.|`|AA12150806	It is probably a haemorrhoid. See your doctor about it to get a positive confirmation though. <br>  <br>  Haemorrhoids are very common and are easily treated. If you see any bleeding after using the toilet (doing a poo, that is), this is one of the symptoms. There are over the counter creams from the drugstore to cure them.<br>  <br>  Please, see your doctor first.|`|PzkGIlPRaa	You have a hemroid first thing you need to do is stop touching it so it will go back into your ***.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Hemroid.......eeewwww!!!!!|`|qJvMWlBUaa	its a henriod go to the doctor.. or get sum preparation H!|`|amLzTNeVaa	Sounds like you have an external hemorroid, some people call them a pile.<br>  <br>  It is basically a swollen and inflamed blood vessel, which will be very painful when placed under pressure and when you go to the toilet.<br>  <br>  The only person you can actually believe is your doctor, because only an exam is going to give you an exact diagnosis. You can always discuss it with your parents who may also be able to tell exactly what it is.<br>  <br>  If it is a hemorroid then you can purchase medication for it over the counter at any pharmacy and sometimes even in supermarkets. The cream shrinks the vein and provides pain relief.<br>  <br>  Surgery is only used in extreme cases with longtime suffers and not someone your age.<br>  <br>  It will go down overtime, but it can take from a week to 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Do not try to pop it regardless of what it is as doing some will only cause bleeding and open you up to a potential infection.|`|f8h0COwhaa	Yeah this is normal, you're just constipated..<br>  Er, yeah it hurts sometimes too but drink lots of water and go on a diet and you'll be fine. it won't hurt for a long time. <br>  I have a 'bump' too, but it's just there, doesn't hurt or anything. Just keep an eye on it and don't freak out. One reason might be because you haven't gone to the restroom in a long time or you've been going too much... Hope this helped :)|`|cRxoNPYkaa	Of course I can't know for sure without seeing it, but it sounds like you have a hemorrhoid.   That's a blood vessel that had burst under the skin and filled up a balloon like sac.  When you push from being constipated, it causes these to form, so don't do that.  Get some OTC cream, like Prep H, and consider seeing the doctor.<br>  <br>  It's not really a good idea to try to get medical diagnoses from complete strangers on the internet, BTW.|`|8EHYNBNtaa	You have what's called a "pile" or hemorrhoid. Get some tucks pads and drink lots of water. If it doesn't get any better, call the doctor for an appointment. It's fairly common.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	It might be an STD.

Also, the only side effects I ever experienced from it are sore breasts before my period, which I had not previously had a problem with... I love it! My gyno told me that it's actually more safe for you because you have a constant level of hormones in your body as opposed to hormone levels only being really high for a couple hours after you take the pill.

This may be why you can't get a prescription for adequate pain medication. If pain interferes with your quality of life the doctor IS NOT doing his job. Keep trying different doctors until you find one who can effectively manage your pain.|`|7Jox8ziWaa	Orthopedic surgeon/doctor|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	If you had an MRI and nothing was found, then it is probably muscular, try exercises to strenghten your core, lose weight if you are overweight, one pound in front is like ten in back pushing on your back. Back pain sucks, I know. Neurologists only examine you and tell you their opinon, they dont actually do anything to treat you. Chiropractors vary widely in quality and knowledge. Osteopaths are actual doctors, but not always easy to find. Accupuncture works well on some people, you might try that. Your furniture can cause back aches also, either at home or at work, get the best you can, it's worth it. I can totally hose my back just by sitting on crappy chairs.

For about 12 years now I have been plagued by some "problem" with my back, which only leads to neck, shoulder, chest and sometimes lower back pain.<br>  <br>  It has stripped me of a fruitful life, I am always in pain at some rate or another and my back and neck "give out" at least once a month (like TODAY!)  I am cranky, bitchy, irritable and people just think I must be a ***** by nature... What they don't understand is... I AM IN F'ING PAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE ON THIS WAY!!!!  I am actually a really nice girl I am just miserable...<br>  <br>  I have been to (and worked for) a chiropractor... OMG What a f'ing JOKE!!! People do NOT GO TO CHIROPRACTORS they are a sham and 9 times out of 10 only make your issues WORSE!  I have had many x-rays, MRI's, and have seen a neurologist who did NOTHING but try and give me f'ing Migraine meds...I don't suffer from Migraines!<br>  <br>  I have been dropping TONS of money on 2 hour massages bi-weekly because it is the ONLY thing (outside of pain killers and alcohol) that bring me any temporary relief!!!  I have found that excersizing does make a difference in the daily pain ratio but it has never taken it completely away.<br>  <br>  I have no f'ing idea what to do and I completely HEAR YOU!!! Loud and f'ing clear!!!!  I am 29 years old and have felt like I am a senior citizen since I was 16.  I was in a car accident when I was 15 and have NEVER been the same since and seemingly NO ONE can help me.  If you find out where to go please advise me as well, I will be so GREATLY in your debt!!!

mTFfFZCnaa	First assessment:<br>  1. How old are you?<br>  2. Since when did this rash start?<br>  3. What allergens are you allergic at? Do you remember where you've been and what you ate?<br>  <br>  Intervention:<br>  1. Try changing your soap with hypoallergenic.<br>  2. Visit a dermatologist.Scalp. Common causes of itching of the scalp include psoriasis, head lice, seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) and contact dermatitis.<br>  <br>  Eyelids. Common causes of eyelid itching includes contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis.<br>  <br>  Nose. The most common cause of nasal itching is allergic rhinitis.<br>  <br>  Ears. Itching of the ear canal has been associated with allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis and otitis externa (swimmer's ear).<br>  <br>  Chest/Abdomen/Back. Common causes of itching of the skin on the main part of the body may include contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, scabies infection, psoriasis, and folliculitis.<br>  <br>  Arms. Itching of the arms, especially the area at the bend of the elbow, can be due to atopic dermatitis. Other causes include xerosis (dry skin) and brachioradial pruritus (itching along the upper arms, neck and shoulder blades related to sun exposure and nerve damage of the upper spine).<br>  <br>  Legs. Itching of the legs is caused by many of the same diseases that cause itching of the arms, and atopic dermatitis is a very common cause of itching behind the knees. Pruritic rashes of the knees (and elbows) is commonly caused by psoriasis and dermatitis herpetiformis.<br>  <br>  Hands and Feet. Itching of the hands and feet may be due to contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, pompholox (dyshidrotic eczema), tinea (“ringworm”) and scabies.<br>  <br>  Groin/Armpits. Common causes of itching of the groin and armpits include tinea (“jock itch”), contact dermatitis, scabies and candida (yeast) infections.<br>  <br>  Anus. The most common cause of itching of the anus region is pruritus ani, caused by an intestinal infection by pinworms.<br>  <br>  Generalized Pruritus<br>  <br>  In those with generalized pruritus, or itching all over, a systemic disease may be the cause in about 50 percent of people. Symptoms also may be caused by medication use, various infections (including parasitic infections of the intestines), iron deficiency, liver disease, kidney disease, high or low thyroid function, as well as certain cancers such as lymphoma. Chronic urticaria (hives), especially dermatographism, and systemic forms of contact dermatitis, are also common causes of generalized pruritus, even if no visible rash is present.<br>  <br>  Medications that are well known to cause itching include opiates, such as Vicodin (acetaminophen/hydrocodone), morphine and codeine. Other groups of medications causing itching include Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), aspirin, NSAIDs, and any of a large number of medications that cause itching by affecting the liver.<br>  <br>  Tests for generalized pruritus, especially when no rash is present, may include a complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, iron level, stool studies for parasites, and a chest x-ray (looking for evidence of lymphoma).<br>  <br>  How is Pruritus Treated?<br>  <br>  The best treatment of pruritus is to fix the underlying cause of the itching, as well as treatment of the specific skin condition. Non-specific treatments for pruritus, such as topical steroid creams and oral antihistamines, as well as good skin care and moisturizing, can provide much relief for people with generalized pruritus.<br>  It is recommended that people with symptoms of itching, especially generalized pruritus, see their doctor for appropriate evaluation and treatment.|`|CqLjZfkLaa	Take a benadryl and see if it helps.

If that doesn't help, see a doctor.|`|65Y7KVaiaa	Did the rash break out suddenly, or over the course of weeks?  If it's a rash from an allergic reaction, try something like calamine lotion.  It works really well to calm itchy rashes, though you're probably not going to want to wear it out in public (pink).  You could also try something stronger such as hydrocortisone ointment, though it sounds like this rash is too large to use a topical such as this.  You might try going a google for "rash pictures" to see if you can identify what it is.  Have you had chicken pox before?  If you can't figure it out yourself, I recommend you make an appointment with a dermatologist or your family doctor.|`|pBhbQiMtaa	have you been to the doc? you may be allergic to something (peanuts) for example.

AA11693263	If its in the muscle it's probably stress related. If so, then try using a heating pad on it. Take some Advil to help with pain and inflammation. Try to always keep your neck and shoulder muscles relaxed. If you can do this for a few days you should start to feel an improvement. But you have to stay as relaxed as possible.

z5JkgFOyaa	Only a doctor can tell for sure if you have a yeast infection by taking a swab and run some tests. Most of us can sometimes tell by the feel, look, and smell that you have a yeast infection. If your symptoms don't match this list, or you are confused or uncertain, go see your doctor if at all possible.<br>  <br>  It feels like an intense itching, burning sensation, localized in your vagina and vulva. This itching is not always present, but can get really bad, so bad you can hardly walk, let alone sit still or concentrate on anything.<br>  <br>  It looks like clumpy white stuff. Most medical descriptions compare the discharge to ricotta cheese, but it can range from thick and not clumpy to faintly yellow to thin and clear. <br>  <br>  It smells like bread or beer. In fact, it smells pretty much exactly like yeast.<br>  <br>  There are other types of infections that can sometimes infect your vagina and vulva and it's helpful to know the symptoms of all of them so you can be really sure before you go treat yourself for a yeast infection you might not have. <br>  <br>  A bacterial infection of the vagina can feel a lot like a yeast infection if the vulval area is itchy or painful. Unlike a yeast infection, the discharge can be dark yellow, green, or brown and it won't smell like bread, it can smell like fish or something rotting. If you think you might have a bacterial infection, or if you're not sure, get I would recommend going to see your doctor as this has to be treated with prescription antibiotics. <br>  <br>  Urinary tract infections (UTI's) are due to bacteria infecting the urethra rather than the vagina. UTI's can be fairly easily distinguished from vaginal infections by a host of symptoms, including pain or burning when urinating, blood or mucus in urine, needing to urinate often, pain or pressure in back or lower abdomen and a fever or chills. If you think you might have a UTI, don't delay, go see your doctor, because the infection can travel up past the bladder, causing kidney damage. <br>  <br>  Another type of infection called trichomoniasis is caused by a parasite that can infect both the vagina and the urinary tract, and is primarily sexually transmitted. If you have a trichomoniasis infection, your vagina can be itchy or painful, it can hurt to urinate, intercourse can be painful, and occasionally you can experience pain in your lower abdomen. Again, you have to see a doctor to get antibiotics to treat this. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you see your doctor just to rule out any other infections and to get a proper diagnosis and proper treatment.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|daBtvDv7aa	yes if it iches that what it is .. doesnt have to be discharge but if there white specks that what it is.. good thing you got the monistat.. it should go away by tomorrow good luck|`|By1DJAUOaa	COULD BE MOST LIKELY MAYBE THE WAY YUR BODY REACTS A DIFF WAY TO IT.|`|AA10771601	sounds like the beginning of one.

It sounds similar to the symptoms of chlamydia. The symptoms (if you have any) start out that way, about 3-4 weeks after becoming infected. They also disappear relatively quick. They don't persist, so you may think you had a yeast infection and it went away..but don't be so sure. I thought I had a yeast infection once too...and I didn't have that gross discharge that goes along with yeast infections, but I thought it was anyways....I don't want to freak you out, but unless you are 100% sure you couldn't have it...I would get tested for it just in case. If left untreated, it can cause serious problems.|`|vF8mnvakaa	The white spots could be the yeast itself. There can be internal or external yeast infections. Monistat will clear it up fast.

LLjD8ElZaa	Suicide is not the answer!! What happened to the money, did you invest any of it?  You should go check yourself into a hospital and get proper help the suicide hotlines are not always equipped to help in all situations.  As far as handling your debt is concerned, you should see a lawyer, and an accountant and find out what your best options are, and talk to the collection department, of all lenders.  But, first you need to seek help; your debt is not going anywhere, it will be there when you are better.. You should go to the hospital or call your doctor immediately.|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	Okay, you are only 25, and I see your debt problem, but you CAN file for Backrubcy, I did, in 1997, and I was only 9K in debt, single with a baby.<br>  It takes about 6 months.

But your situation is different.  Personally, and i'm being serious on this i would leave the country and live someplace else.  I'm 19 years old and don't have kids to worry about or a wife so that's what I would do.  Its hard to leave home but when your someplace else on a clean slate you will feel better.  I lived in a small town where I had a lot of trouble with the law and as soon as I got off probation I moved to LA and started over.  It sucked leaving all my friends but I made new ones and i kept contact.  your still young and 400k is a lot a money to be in debt at such a young age.  Suicide would probably be on my mind too.  Although you have to really open your mind and think of the options.  If your willing to kill yourself you might as well try out moving someplace else and starting over.  My dad is in the same situation your in (he owes the government a **** ton of money) and he moved to a very small town in Oregon living with a friend who put his name down for the apartment.  He works under the table doing painting, construction, logging, or just anything to get by.  He has nothing to trace him.  no car, cell phone, credit card etc.  He hated it at first but he has adjusted to it.  And he actually makes a little bit of money to come down and visit me.  So all I'm saying is that your going to really open your mind on this one.  Look at some options before you attempt suicide.  email me if you want to talk more about it.|`|umGi6gTcaa	God Damn wtf did you spend all that money on?!<br>  Claim bankruptcy, it won't wipe away your debt but hopefully it'll make it all easier on you.<br>  <br>  Suicide isn't the answer. I know it all seems hopeless now but you're young and there are so many things for you to experience. Think about what you're gonna miss out on, like is there a place you always wanted to visit? Don't you want to one day have a baby and hold that tiny precious thing in your arms? <br>  <br>  Do you want your mother to be sad over your death? Do you want her to inherit your debt? Life isn't fair but you know what is worse? A mother having to bury her child, if you committed suicide it would be like killing a part of her. I'm a mother and if my little girl died I don't think I could go on living.<br>  <br>  I used to get depressed a lot, I would focus on my husband or the ocean, a starry sky and now my Jade. If I killed myself I'd never see them again, which is worse then anything life can throw at me.<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to voluntarily check yourself in to an institution, you could use the help and a break from reality would be nice.<br>  <br>  Ppl care about you, I don't know you but I do. Don't do it.|`|whyW8VhZaa	Suicide is not the only answer.<br>  <br>  There are many avenues to find help if you do not have sources of income.  Try calling the suicide hotline again and asking them for a list of mental health facilities in your area.  Every state employs social workers/ case workers for mentally ill people (not only for the super-"crazy" but also for people who simply have anxiety issues, or depression, or a phobia).  Many social workers and facilities provide services pro-bono for those who cannot pay.  First, take care of your emotional state, and once you have help with that, the same people can make connections to help you get out of debt.<br>  <br>  >> You can work together with a team of people who want you to feel better and live a good life. <<<br>  <br>  What state do you live in?  Look up places there.<br>  <br>  This suggestion is probably not going to sound good, but it can be very helpful, and trust me I KNOW this: you can voluntarily check in to a mental health facility for a small amount of time.  If you tell them that you are seriously considering suicide and you feel that your life is in danger, and that you are having serious problems in your life, these people will be sympathetic.  A two-week commitment can be almost an escape from the difficulties of the outside world, and there are people there who can help you find the resources to negotiate debt dissolution with creditors, etc.<br>  <br>  What mental disorders do you suffer from?  There are specialized professional counselors who can help you with the specific issues that you are struggling with.<br>  <br>  It's true that you can't "zap" away your debt, but it is entirely possible to reduce it, and it can be easy, with help, to work out affordable payment plans.  Social workers have connections, and can tell you how to lower your debt, help you find a job, help you work through mental problems as they surface, and if finding/keeping a job remains troublesome, they can help you get on federal and state aid (food stamps can be an absolute godsend - you can't spend them on anything else or run up a debt, but you can keep yourself fed, for the most part).<br>  <br>  If you do lose your home, can you move in with your mother?  I know that sometimes this isn't an option, but it is something to consider.  If you bought/own a home and that is a source of debt, do you have the option of reselling the home, rather than having it foreclosed?  This can solve a lot of your debt, even if you sell it for a much lower price (you will still owe money, but less than you do now).<br>  <br>  Please remember that there are people who care about you, and who can help you through hard times.  You can speak to a therapist, a doctor, a suicide hotline call-taker, a friend, a relative, a religious leader, or even an acquaintance, to get help.<br>  <br>  Plus, you have all of us here on yahoo answers =)<br>  <br>  Edit: to clarify, it is not always easy to get a social worker, or to check yourself into an institution.  Even if you take the initiative to ask for help (which is hard by itself), these people are very overworked and the institutions are already overfilled.  But you have to try in order to succeed.|`|600529c0a210694b9e33acfe0ddd0452aa	If you are really in problem.... come here to india......<br>  <br>  I can let you know how you can easily earn a lot of money while working here.... and India is really really Richer...<br>  Sam|`|9be82fb8efb6f5ead9f7cef3dec12d72aa	don't end your life ... it's won't help the case ...<br>  rather look for some other options ...|`|db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	Think it through:  you kill yourself.  great.  then your mom gets saddled with all that debt.<br>  <br>  What, you think if you die, your debt goes away?  no, stupid, the banks want their money.

AA10736671	u cant loose weight only from Exercise:  Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%<br>  1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body.

8c3928ce39cd98e96b5b55afe6bfec47aa	BLS is Basic Life Support which teaches you the basics of first aid and management of the ill or injured person and the unconscious person, and Chain of Survival steps are;<br>  1/ Early recognition of the emergency and activation of emergency medical services<br>  2/ Early bystander CPR<br>  3/ Early use of a defibrillator<br>  4/ Early advanced life support and post-resuscitation care<br>  Bystanders with training in BLS can perform the first 3 of the 4 steps.<br>  <br>  Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation - is where we use artificial respiration  to keep a casualty circulation going until EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) arrives.<br>  <br>  Mechanical ventilation is done by EMTs as it is a specialized area of training.<br>  <br>  Bag Valve mask or Ambu bag - is a hand-held device used to provide positive pressure ventilation to a casualty who is not breathing or who is not breathing normally. Again this is a specialized area of training too. <br>  <br>  The Automated External  Defibrillator which is a light weight portable electronic device that is attached to the casualties exposed chest, with stick pads, it then examines the electrical output from the heart and determines if the casualty has a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, it powers up and you then push a button which then delivers a shock to the casualties heart, to reestablish an effective rhythm of the heart. <br>  <br>  The AED or Defib does NOT replace CPR it is used as assistive tool in the chain of survival. They are simple to use all you need to do is follow the voice prompts. <br>  <br>  The use of the AED increases the survival rate of the casualty with a heart attack up to 80%, without it the chance of survival is as low as 5%, hence the training and use of the AED.|`|dVQdswtTaa	To narrow it down to the bare minimum, there is the CPR that non medical people do, and the CPR for health care providers. <br>  <br>  Non medical CPR is checking for signs of breathing or heartbeat, and doing compressions. (Hands only CPR) It covers clearing an airway with the Heimlich maneuver. It is also taught with AED since there are so many public access AEDs out there now. <br>  <br>  CPR for health care providers goes into greater detail, and covers pulse checks, AED, positive pressure ventilation, airway adjuncts (nasal, oral airways, and endo-tracheal tubes) It also gets a little more into the science behind CPR.<br>  <br>  Defibrillators are available in AED and manual. The manual types are usually part of a cardiac monitor that you'd see in a hospital or on an ambulance. AEDs will only allow you to shock two specific cardiac rhythms, called ventricular fibrillation (V- Fib) or ventricular tachycardia (V- Tach). Manual defibrillators allow a medical professional to shock other rhythms, and pace the heart if it can't maintain a healthy beat. <br>  <br>  If you do CPR on someone who needs it, you have given them their best chance to survive. Not everyone makes it, but you will have done all anyone can do.

NPpalf1Gaa	If your lower jaw is bigger than your upper jaw you most likely have a jaw deformity. <br>  This problem can NOT be treated with braces because it is dealing with the actual bones and not just the teeth. <br>  You may need a surgery called Orthognathic surgery, which corrects upper and lower jaw deformities such as if you have a larger upper or lower jaw.<br>  If it is getting to the point to where the joints of your jaw are hurting, it is painful to chew, or you find it hard to open or close your mouth, you definitely need to see a facial and oral surgeon right away.. and note this does not mean right when you go in they will perform the surgery. It takes almost a year for to attain the exact measurements, do x-rays, and get your teeth into the correct position for surgery preparation which does require braces, even if you've already worn them.<br>  But do get this process started as it takes a long time for it to pend.<br>  If you do decide to get the surgery, insurance will mostly likely not cover it and say it is cosmetic rather than medical, and this surgery is quite expensive starting at $15,000 (in Texas.) So perhaps visit a medical emergency room and tell them you are having jaw pains, that way it is on record that it is causing you problems and you can submit that claim to your insurance company. <br>  <br>  You did not cause this, it is just the way your bones are.. I know this by experience and am still waiting to have my surgery to correct it.

ZHJuK1QNaa	Ribs expand during pregnancy.   Ribs are attached to your spine with a flexible type of cartilage.  That is why you can twist, bend and rotate from side to side.  As your belly grew your ribs moved out to accommodate everything that was being shifted around. <br>      From the bottom of your ribs to your pubic bone there is a set of two muscles. With pregnancy those muscles also split further apart, once again to accommodate your growing belly.<br>      To help with the increased weight your hips also spread apart. <br>  Many of these things may never go back to your "pre-prego"  body.  <br>  Do your best to strengthen your abdominal muscles.  With a stronger  core your ribs will move back as much as they can, and those two muscles will move back closer together. <br>     With each subsequent birth your muscles will loose muscle tone and elasticity. It becomes a little harder each time to return back to your "new normal."<br>      Our bodies take a beating for these little ones. And one side effect might be a slightly wider torso and hips.  A small price to pay for such a wonderful blessing!|`|GO46i2l9aa	I have a rib that stick out too, and all I was told was to get more abs and a better core muscle because that is suppose to keep it all in.

2U27BgmKaa	I eat a lot of sweet fruits like raspberries, grapes, and pineapple. I love fruit! I also eat lots of veggies (half my diet is veggies). I think that a really great alternative to the pizzas and burgers are healthy sandwiches. I usually have a warm turkey sandwich with melted baby Swiss cheese, spinach leaves, avocado slices, mayo and bacon bits. It's actually quite healthy and DELICIOUS! I also chew gum as a way to curb my appetite. Having that mint taste in your mouth makes everything taste bad. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water and try to only eat bread for breakfast and lunch. I would also put a piece of string or something on your wrist. Every time you go to eat pizza or burgers, you will see that string and remind yourself that this isn't something that you want to do. Once you last a week on a healthy diet, you won't want to go back to being unhealthy because of how good you're going to feel.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	It is so difficult to meet the famous and notorious "inner pig dog" to overcome and to eat less.

I'm a huge pizza and burger fan as well and I like my food spicy. I used to hate cold veggies and salad and didn't mind hot veggies as long as they were heavily seasoned. <br>  <br>  Something I've been doing for the last year or so is mixing together hot and cold veggies and adding the McCormick Montreal spicy seasoning to the hot while they steam in the microwave. So, for example - grab a few bags of frozen medleys from the freezer section of the supermarket, put them in a microwavable bag with some seasoning and steam them in the microwave. Add them to cold veggies - aka - salad stuff - spinach, tomato, cuc's... whatever you can stomach... The results are not half bad. You can also add a small amount of shredded cheese or a meat of your choice for extra flavor. It's pretty filling as well, especially if you drink a lot of water with the meal. <br>  I've found skipping the dressings and using the seasonings instead has made a world of difference in the fat department. But honestly - it took me a while to get used to eating the veggies. I think it's an accustomed taste. Once you get used to it, it's not half bad and you'll actually enjoy them. And the bonus is they are really good for you. <br>  <br>  I've also tried the Boca and Morning Star burgers and chicken patties. They're a good source of protien and if you dress them up right, they're not too bad either - but again - kind of have to train yourself into liking them. It's tough to break the grease habit.  <br>  Hope this helps a little?<br>  Good luck|`|AA10230143	I used to work for Dominos pizza and believe me that was my diet for 7 years and the pounds kept adding on.

Though I have recently lost three stone. If you have the determination to lose the weight then that is the first step. Take a packed lunch to work with you and eat that somewhere away from the pizza place. Take a walk if need be. Allow yourself pizza once a week as a treat, as if you deny yourself all the yummy food you'll go mad and break your diet.<br>  As for foods to eat, try replacing the burger with a roast beef sandwich. Try and eat things that are natural, ie not man made.  ignore these people who tell you to cut out all carbs or something like that, the goal is to have a BALANCED diet that you can stick to. make the changes slowly, and it'll seem less of a "diet". ie change your butter to reduced fat spread, full fat milk to skimmed milk. You can even make your own pizza with some pitta bread, passata (tomatoes) and low-fat cheese. That way you get your pizza fix but with less calories! For crisps and things try swapping to lower fat versions, like weight watchers crisps. In the summer you could have things like salad and yoghurts. Some people have said that in order to keep them on their diet they have one day a week where they can eat whatever they want, but on all the other days they must be good! Jacket potatoes are a good meal, as are things on toast such as spaghetti and beans. Try making some dishes yourself with lean mince such as spaghetti bolognese, cottage pie or lasagne. Fish is also very good for you if you like that.<br>  Try and stick to it as best you can, but if you have an off day dont punish yourself. just put it behind you and start afresh the next day.<br>  And most importantly - GOOD LUCK!

If so, this would indicate that your brain is sending the right signals and you should have started by now or will start very soon. If you are very undeveloped, then it could be that there is something up that is stopping your body from maturing. Either way, I would see a doctor - generally after sixteen years of age, this is considered as a condition called amenorrhoea (the absence of menstruation in a woman of reproductive age). What you have would be referred to as primary amenorrhoea which means that your periods have never started. I wouldn't worry too much though - as long as your body seems healthy and you are not very undeveloped, underweight, anorexic or constantly stressed, chances are that your body is just moving at a slower rate and you will start naturally, but definitely see a doctor to put your mind at rest. It is generally accepted that if menstruation has not begun by sixteen years of age, help should be sought. Good luck.|`|8W9Zl9Tvaa	Gosh i don't know why they wouldn't have started yet.<br>  Mine started when I was 12. They arnt something you wanna get. They are awful..<br>  <br>  But you should still see a docter to see if you have any issues.|`|GoNCzxAuaa	You should see a doctor to make sure you don't have a hormone balance.  If you're seventeen and haven't started menstruating it is time to become concerned.|`|TXfc1Ultaa	Don't worry some girls don't get it until there 18. If you don't get it by then you probably should see a doctor. But don't worry your not missing out on anything :)

PfmXPbFpaa	Oh Jonas, many men *** harder when they are receiving anal sex because their prostrate gland is stimulated (like a male g-spot).  Doesn't matter what your orientation.<br>  <br>  I do not think there is a "supposed to" when it comes to how long you last.  Everyone is different, do what feels good.|`|SS5py9jIaa	lmfao.. there's no "supposed to" involved. If you've had enough of taking a hammering just say so. Sex is meant to be fun.

My suggestion would be its different for everyone depending on when they orgasm. i have never experienced anal sex before so I am not sure if you can orgasm. I'm sure it depends on the person. <br>  <br>  PS I hope you don't think I am being rude.

GGLh6nqYaa	unfortunately since marijuana is illegal so is doing any kind of study on it as long as the federal government has it's way.  However studies from other countries have proven time and time again that marijuana basically has no long term side effects.  Although smoke is never good for your lungs so the smoke of it alone can harm you and make you more prone to lung infections, there are other ways of using it though.  So don't buy into the whole "amotivational syndrome" thing.  People are lazy if they choose to be lazy, a drug doesn't really change that.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	God JAH made weed, man made it illegal.

Hope this helps.|`|r7M3uxO7aa	I am having similar issues.  I am 42.  I have tried some things already.  I take a hot jacuzzi bath each night.  I sleep on a sleep by number bed.  I have been diagnosed with arthritis in my sacroilliac.  I have taken too many ibuprofens!  I use a heating pad regularly.  I always wake up stiff in my back.  Somedays, it is uncomfortable other days it is painful.  Somedays I wake up with the "hangover" although I do not drink alcohol.  I am going to investigate food issues.  I am starting by keeping a food diary.<br>  I am especially concerned with water too, since I know that the first sign of dehydration (a major portion of a hangover also) is a head ache.  I have several allergies and several close family members who have sworn off gluten but I will not give it up lightly.  So, I am going to see if maybe I am injesting something to aggrevate me: maybe its just high fructose corn syrup or MSG.  good luck.

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	First the exercising:<br>  Ask your spine doctor to check the status of your scoliosis. Following the appropriate medical work-up, ask for a PT evaluation, so you can be placed on an appropriate PT program.<br>  <br>  Phase 1 focuses on education, posture, and flexibility to decrease pain. Phase 2 emphasizes strength and fitness activities to improve function by working on your core muscles. This will help with the soreness.<br>  <br>  Yoga can also help to strengthen the muscles of the back. But exercise, PT, and yoga are not a cure for scoliosis and will not be able to correct the abnormal curve.<br>  <br>  Now your body image:<br>  You have to have a strong sense of self and not let it mess with your idea of body image. I had a spinal fusion with iliac crest bone graft in 1985 (13 yrs old). I still have a 40 degree curve, a prominent shoulder blade, one shoulder is higher, my hips a little uneven, and rib prominence on one side. But my spine is stable, no breathing or cardiac problems and I carried two pregnancies without a hitch.<br>  <br>  The one shoulder that is higher makes it easier to sling a shoulder bag on. And those uneven hips...that one that juts out a little more is a perfect resting spot for an infant.<br>  <br>  I have no problem wearing backless things. I think I have a great back scar. The hip scar, not so pretty. But everyone, EVERYONE, has problem areas on their body. I'm an RN, I've seen thousands of naked bodies, no one is perfect. Here are some other famous people who share scoliosis with us: <a href="http://www.scoliosis-world.com/famous_people_with_scoliosis.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scoliosis-world.com/famous_pe...</a><br>  <br>  Some concern about one's appearance is normal, but an obsession with one's appearance is not. If you think you might be more than concerned, talk to a professional.<br>  <br>  I'm as normally functioning as anyone (are any of us really "normal"?). I never got off schedule with school. Graduated college at 20 and have been an OR nurse for 17 years, one of the most physically demanding areas of nursing (lots of lifting and lots of standing in one place for long periods). I've had 2 children without difficulty (didn't even use an epidural). I love to travel (I don't set off metal detectors), yoga (though the fusion prevents some positions), and SCUBA dive. I can pretty much do anything I want...but don't tell my husband I use the scoliosis to get out of vacuuming :)|`|AA12150806	Stretch the right side, by doing lateral stretches.

41b8934270c7c7a33b0719026e687273aa	Yes.  The more muscle you have, the more calories you will burn while resting and during activity.  If you don't eat enough then your body will go into a slight catabolic state.  Don't fill up on too much junk for the sake of your long term health though.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Yes, you have to increase your daily caloric intake to a surplus of calories in order to gain muscle mass.  Remember to do short sets of heavy reps and to have a healthy diet with equal amounts of complex carbs and lean proteins.<br>  <br>  There are sites that offer great advice for bodybuilding, just do a quick google search (t-nation is one I can think of offhand).|`|AA12150806	No. <br>  <br>  If you eat more calories and don't burn them off, you will get fat. Nothing to do with muscle mass. <br>  <br>  Eating a lot of protein will damage your kidneys and liver in the long run, so don't drink those shakes/eat those protein bars etc for long periods. Seriously- they will f*** your kidneys.|`|GoNCzxAuaa	No, you shouldn't eat a lot of calories.  If you're trying to gain muscle mass, it's about making the calories you intake count.  Eat lean proteins, low in calories and fat, high in the protein your muscles need.  Eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, and drink a lot of water.  Try not to overdo it on carbs.  It's a myth to overload on carbs to give yourself more energy.  You just crash.|`|TKmpzgHPaa	Well first off how much are you working out a week? You need to know exactly how many calories you are burning off to know how much to consume. Also you still need to be eating healthy. Drink lots of water and eat a lot of chicken and fish (tuna or salmon). I would recommend making shakes and adding protein powder to it. Read the label very closely because EAS whey protein can do damage to your insides. Good Luck|`|wwRbkCMraa	I was able to go from 135 lbs to 175 lbs in one summer.

There are other ways of letting out pain. Maybe it's time to tell her parents or get her a therapist. They can help a lot if she is committed to it. But If she hates the idea of it, then it is useless. It sounds bad, but maybe being hard on her can be good as well. Give to it to her straight, tell her she's stupid for doing it. But if you're positive she won't take that well, then don't do it.|`|8Oc4fBWwaa	Hello friends,<br>  <br>  I myself have been cutting my flesh for the past year. I used to have this huge distance between me and my closest friend after doing an incredibly stupid thing. Everyday I would cry in my bathroom and wet my pillow and burst out in school. Did anyone notice? No. My mom found out about my depression and told my dad. Well daddy didn't do anything at all while my mother tried to cure me with her T.L.C! She would constantly say, relax,exercise,do breathing exercises for 10 minutes everyday. Clearly she didn't understand my problem. IM EFFIN DEPRESSED MOM! I AND CHLOE ARE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE! THE RACIAL TENSION IN MY SCHOOL LEAVES ME ALL ALONE BY MYSELF! MY BEST FRIEND JUST GOT LOST AND CHLOE IS LEAVING FOR NEW ZEALAND IN A FEW MONTHS! IVE BEEN HAVING THIS MASSIVE HEADACHES AND I SLEEP IN CLASS! WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT MOM?! That wasn't the huge problem that got me to cut myself but this was - Okay, calm down Amelin. Lets try that breathing exercise now. Inhale....Exhale....Inhale....Exhale.... That clearly stated nobody could help me. <br>  - Mom I want help! Everyday its hell for me. Its the normal routine, i wake up feeling super depressed and afraid, I go trough a bad day of school and I come home and weep.<br>  She got a piece of paper and a pen and started jotting down stuff like eat Pannadol, do breathing exercises, go for headache appointment in the next 2 weeks. I felt totally helpless and I prayed, everyday, for some change. Of course, I didn't get any change by then.<br>  <br>  <br>  One day as my father was on holiday I was packing up for school, I felt the burning in my stomach which I had for the past week getting worse. I told my my mother I couldn't stand it and I probably couldn't survive in school with this stomach. Well not exactly, If i told her that she wouldn't have listened. All I did was let out a few yelps of pain before my mother said those golden words. "Amy. I'll bring you straight to the hospital." ( She's a nurse)  I changed into my casual clothing and went to the hospital. At the hospital, I met a really friendly doctor who understood my situation. I let out absolutely everything and finally blurted out that I was cutting myself. He then did a regular physical check up and called my mother in. "Hey. Heres the list for the gastrict she has and your daughter is incredibly depressed. You should do something about it."he looked at my mom without any feelings on his face. "TLC?"was my mothers reply. "No.Make an appointment with the PSY." Imagine if she really did the headache appointment after 2 weeks, I would have gone to the suicidal spot!<br>  <br>  So I went to see a psychiatrist with high hopes that this could just help me. I was wrong. My mother had raised my hopes telling me what a cool psychiatrist this guy was and how he was a great person. That bi*ch doesnt get anything does she? He was this old man who made me repeat my problems over and over and over again so he could get what I was saying. After the appointment I screamed at my mother in the car as it just made everything worse! As soon as I reached home I ran to my room and slammed the door shut. I HATED MY MOM AND DAD! Then After weeping some more I saw a hair pin on my right. Unlike others, I dont cut with blades. I cut with those sharp hair pins because they are so easy to get and cut the top of ur skin only. So i took that hair pin, sharpened its tip a lil more and started cutting my left thigh, It wasnt enough, I used my long fingernails to scratch my skin. Then the pain came and blood started oozing from my wounds. The pain was just magical, even more magical then chocolate. I felt free. The sight of the blood coming out seemed like a bit of my trouble is coming out. I loved it. Thats when I started cutting myself  3 days a week.<br>  <br>  I had no one on my side. Unlike your friend, nobody really cared if I was cutting, nobody knew about it except for my best friend, the doctor and that horrid psychiatrist. I really needed someone to comfort me. Thats probably good enough for your friend. U need to make it clear that she has to stop, make her tell out her problems and make sure you solve it. Dont help her solve it. U have to make her and yourself to solve her problems if you really care about her as much as you say.<br>  <br>  She probably wont forget about it though. I havent yet and the hate I have of my mom is still burning inside of me. I just hate my parents so much. Im helpless, as I am still a teenager with not much financial support if I dont have my parents there with the education I need and the money. Theres absolutely nothing I can do and at times I would get really mad at them because of what they have done I wouldnt talk to them at all and swear. My mom was the first person to make me feel ugly and she has told me before that she should have just let me commit suicide when I attempted to. Time should just fly faster so when I am old enough to move out and get myself a life I can forget it ever happened and drop my parents on their own.|`|AA11318212	To be kind, you have to be cruel.<br>  Talk to her parents.<br>  But don't go empty handed, show them proof of what she has been doing otherwise, you might just be accused of slander.<br>  If you feel you don't have the courage to talk to her parents about it, go see your guidance counselor, she would know whats best and she is trained to handle these situations.|`|tmj2iaCsaa	TELL SOMEONE!!!!<br>  For real, <br>  You need to. <br>  At first, she'll be way mad. <br>  But I can bet you, <br>  She'll get over it and thank you in the long run. <br>  And she'll realize what a great friend you really are. <br>  And how lucky she is to have you.|`|6S8BKhIYaa	u should shut up she jus needs some dick|`|HPO87jGiaa	The kind of help she needs is professional help.

I don't have a smelly problem but I have been on the pill for over 5 years and I feel like this really helps control the excess discharge I was having.

You sound like you're probably still in school, in which case I want to remind you first that alcohol is dangerous to the developing brain, and should NOT be mixed with Valium, ever.<br>  <br>  Are you worried about proving it because you already said something and nobody believed you?  If that hasn't happened yet, then your first step is to say something.  Talk to your aunt, or the parent/s with whom you live (or used to live, if you've moved out already).<br>  <br>  Or, if you don't want to do that right away, you could talk to your cousin.  Confront him about it and don't back down if he starts to deny that anything happened.  If he starts to say hurtful, stupid, manipulative things like "you seemed to enjoy it" or "come on, we were drunk" then you need to tell someone what happened right away, either by walking into the other room and talking to your aunt, or grabbing a phone and calling your mom or someone else.<br>  <br>  And don't spend any more nights at your aunt's house until this has been resolved.  It isn't safe to be around someone with tendencies like that.  While he may have been intoxicated, experimenting, stupid, or not have meant harm, he freaked you out and violated your personal space and safety and you have to explain calmly and rationally what happened and what you remember.<br>  <br>  And think about plans for what you want to do about it.<br>  <br>  You can request that the police be called and he register as a sex offender (probably the harshest thing, but he may very well deserve it), or say that he has to get counseling for the mental problem that he is clearly having, or simply cut off contact with that cousin (if he refuses).<br>  <br>  It's hard to do and no one should have to suffer through it, but if your family cares about you, they will believe you and do everything they can to help you.  And if they don't, fight for it.

Therefore, your body is, in essence, made up of only energy.  We are big balls of energy.<br>  <br>  B.E.S.T. - BioEnergetic Sycronization Technique -- is a technique that works with sycronizing the energy of the body.  When I first heard about it and had it done to me by a Naturopath (a natural doctor) I thought she was crazy and it was all a hoax.  Now, after attending 5 seminars, and countless hours of talking to a chiropractor about it, I am planing on going into B.E.S.T. myself.  It is not the only technique that works with the energy of the body, but it is the best (no pun intended).<br>  <br>  The thing about your energy is sometimes it can get "out of alignment".  Sorta like your spine does sometimes.  This can happen when negative energy is introduced into your body (your energetic field) through thoughts, or just negative people.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your question would better be answered by a couple websites. Check them out!|`|AA11171802	Throughout history, pseudoscientific claims about "spiritual energy" have attempted to gain credibility by associating with forms of energy that were poorly understood by scientists. In the 1800s, electricity and magnetism were in the "borderlands" of science and the subject of considerable electrical quackery. In the 2000s, quantum mechanics and grand unification theory provide similar opportunities for empirical claims of spiritual energy being physically manifest.<br>  <br>  "Spiritual energy" is often equated with empirically understood forces. For example, some believers in the "aura" equate it with electromagnetism, claims that have not yet been supported by experiment. Nevertheless electromagnetic fields are used in standard medical procedures, such as radiation therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, and magnetic resonance imaging.<br>  <br>  Several people, for example, The magician James Randi have for many years (as of 2004) offered one million US dollars to any person capable of repeatedly detecting psychic energy fields. No one has demonstrated this ability in a controlled situation. (see The $1 million challenge)<br>  <br>  Other proposed treatments, such as magnet therapy are considered ineffective until it is demonstrated that they beat the placebo effect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Energy in spirituality, refers to a widespread belief in an interpersonal, non-physical force or essence. Vitalism is a general term for a force that animates living things. Believers consider spiritual energy to be of a different type than those known to science. Various forms of spiritual energy have been postulated, amung these are:<br>  <br>      * the Christian idea of the soul or spirit<br>      * The traditional Chinese qi<br>      * The Indian chakra or shakti<br>      * The New Age/paranormal aura<br>      * The "orgone energy" of Wilhelm Reich<br>      * The morphogenetic fields of biologist Rupert Sheldrake<br>      * The Odic force of chemist Carl von Reichenbach<br>  <br>  Various forms of mysticism often associate "bad energy" with disease, and "good energy" and healing powers. Most theories involve the ability to actively influence one's energy. For example, acupuncture purports to have beneficial effects on the human body by manipulating its natural flow of energy. Reiki is a similar procedure in Japanese culture which involves the qi (ki) and the laying of hands. Different theories hold different judgements on the ability of plants or animals to hold energy forces.<br>  <br>  Theories of spiritual energy are not validated by the scientific method, thus are dismissed as non-empirical beliefs by the scientific community. Theories of spiritual energy are commonly felt to be a "folie à plusieurs".

AA10571743	There will never be a cure for cancer, just effective treatments that will combat the tumors.<br>  <br>  Cancer does not have one single cause, therefore not one single cure.

Skin cancer is caused by exposure to the UVA & UVB radition from the sun.<br>  <br>  The best cure for cancer is prevention (using sunscreen, eating a healthy diet, not smoking, etc.).  Early detection of cancers greatly enhances the chances for survival.<br>  <br>  People need to understand the correlation between lifestyles and cancer risk.  AND, I'm not saying that all cancers are related to lifestyles, i.e, children's cancers, etc.  <br>  <br>  The most promising treatment for cancer that is being researched is developing a way to cut off a tumor's blood supply.

It will pay of in long run. As LPN you have the same job, the almost same responsibilities but less pay and less authority. So go for the real deal. Be RN!|`|ef7549fee6df18024d923f5bd492c589aa	LPNs are considered a joke and have less education.  If you are thinking about becoming either, become an RN!  They get more pay, and are higher up in authority.  And RN's know more.

Stress, such as worrying about a possible pregnancy, money problems, or a cheating/absent partner can cause your period to start sooner or later than you're used to. Illness, something as simple as the flu, can also cause fluctuations. If you haven't had menstrual periods for very long, its entirely possible that your body is still regulating itself. If you're in your 40's, your periods can become irregular as you approach menopause-its called "peri-menopause".  Give it a little more time before you tear your hair out!

From plants, of course. Only plants. … People in Asia and Africa who consume no milk products after they're weaned from their mother's breast grow perfectly healthy skeletons in the normal size for their race. A consistent conclusion published in the scientific literature is clear: Calcium deficiency of dietary origin is unknown in humans. Dairy products contain large amounts of animal proteins. This excess protein removes calcium from the body by way of the kidneys. Knowing the physiological effects on calcium metabolism of eating excess protein explains why societies with the highest intakes of meat and dairy products--the United States, England, Israel, Finland, and Sweden--also show the highest rates of osteoporosis, the disease of bone-thinning."|`|a33b847c20f55a8a10eaff53b1c89374aa	You need to drink milk everyday no matter what your age is.

Instead of skipping the burger just substitute the pancakes for a whole grain cereal, the burger for a salad, and the steak for maybe a meat some veggies and some water.

People tried to guess what it would be like in the intestines, where they knew that Salmonella grew, and copied that. They tested different temperatures and found that 37 celsius (98 F) works the best. This is also the temperature of our bodies! Also, they tried lots of combinations of nutrients, and found that Salmonella like to grow with a carbon (sugar) source. Glucose is the best source, just as it is for us. It is high in energy, and so the bacteria can grow quickly. Amino acids, the building blocks that make up proteins, also help the bacteria to grow, but if they are not present, they can make their own amino acids. Finally, most bacteria like a few minerals and ions to be in the media. They need these to help the proteins work and grow, and to make more DNA (the genetic material that is copied each time the cell divides). So most people add some magnesium, phosphorus and few other things.<br>  <br>  In fact, in the laboratory, we usually use a very complex mixture that contains three things: <br>  <br>  yeast extract: this is like the yeast that is used to make bread and beer, but we kill the yeast, and then the bacteria can grow on them. The yeast extract contains lots of nutrients and goodies for the bacteria to eat. <br>  tryptone: this is a broken down form of casein, proteins that are found in milk. This supplies the bacteria with some amino acids that are not present in the yeast extract. <br>  NaCl: this is table salt. We use this because the Salmonella like a salt rich environment (like the intestine is) but other bacteria don't like it and won't grow so well. <br>  <br>  If we put Salmonella in this mixture, and warm them at 98F, they divide about once every 20 minutes!

Diets do not work. 99% of people gain the weight back. Here is how it works. No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.<br>  <br>  But wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you. So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.<br>  <br>  So it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just like the rat. But they do not want to kill you. They want you to become obese so you will buy lots of their foods. This is called GOOD BUSINESS.

No hace falta que te enfrentes con el pasado, ya fue y no se puede cambiar. Si tu ex pareja te ve y quiere hablarte, evitá los reproches, no hablen de lo que pasó. Si ella quiere hablar, que hable ella, que se descargue, pero una sola vez, no siempre y luego poné distancia emocional y  continuar para adelante con tu vida.<br>  Mucha suerte|`|9f3481b3831a72f37f647533db9f37e6aa	oye ya supéralo, el que ella esté ahí no significa nada tu carrera y tu porvenir profesional estan en juego, creo que debiéras tomarlo más en serio, ademas es la oportunidad de conocer mas gente y porqué no un nuevo amor|`|d70a757485c618248270cbc546022e80aa	entra y que te valga que este ahi|`|deaf19a64d6090bd6cc114f5a9c81bb9aa	Pues, creo que debes ir donde TE CONVIENE MAS POR TUS ESTUDIOS....ya que tu futuro está en juego...y dejar de lado asuntos de adolescencia...vamos chico!!! crece....|`|0c6284b64f7b1c8552b89c86c5286807aa	donde esta tu personalidad que cada vez que tengas que enfrentar algo vas a huir  tienes que madurar que tienes que hacer seguir con lo que tienes planeado y nada mas|`|86b2988472d83b12de50bff234834325aa	yo pienso que si deberías de ir, que tiene que tu ex valla,  tu no vas a ir a verla a ella si no a estudiar. no dejes que nada ni nadien te detenga ni que destruyan tus sue?os. y en este caso, si decides no ir, el único que va arruinar tus sue?os eres tu.....|`|cd9f123d63ded14a8a406c742a9811acaa	Lo que yo te recomendaria es que enfrentes tus nervios, tu miedo, tu pasado si quieres tener tu carrera de ingenieria...ve a esa univeridad ya veras que saldras triunfante de todo.. es mas te apuesto a que tu ex novia se lamentara de haberte dejado..una cosa mas no  tomes encuenta a tu ex novia  y enfocate en tus estudios que esos si te sacaran adelante..te deseo suerte en tu futuro...|`|cfcf3a0b540e7338833496dc042044c2aa	como ya te dijeron tienes que entrar a la universidad porque es el primer paso para construir tu futuro y recuerda el pasado es pasado no dejes que eso te afecte siempre tienes que mirar hacia adelante y no hacia atrás, saludos y suerte|`|009544cf2fb2c55c2ab76df669a64eb6aa	ponerte a estudiar no seguir a las personas|`|2a7e293bf202e1a9d94d4a3194addcacaa	AYUDENME con este problema por favor...????? <br>  <br>  Por favor, un borrador para los recuerdos.<br>  <br>  - Y ?qué pretendes?, ?Borrar y poder escribir sobre ellos, como quien quiere cambiar la historia<br>  - Sé que no puedo hacerlo, ahí están y no se pueden borrar... ?has oído hablar de la amnesia?, bueno, quisiera poner una dosis de amnesia para esos recuerdos.<br>  - Je, je, esto que dices me hace reír, una dosis de amnesia, je, je, je.<br>  - No es un chiste, es algo que deseo muy en serio.<br>  - ?Porqué no intentas hablar de esos recuerdos que te mortifican igual que el que grita para desahogarse? No es olvidar ni intentar hacerlo, hay que enfrentarlos y descubrir donde te culpan.<br>  - ?Culparmen? ?Porqué culparmen?<br>  - Si tu no sintieras culpa, no buscarías olvidar, ?has escuchado la frase perdón y olvido? Pues bien, se sincero contigo mismo y perdónate, tal vez con eso no vayas a olvidar el recuerdo pero si a la amargura que te provoca. El problema no está en los malos recuerdos, sino en la forma como enfocamos nuestros sentimientos hacia ellos.<br>  - Eso no es fácil, me han causado y he causado da?o.<br>  - Bien, para el da?o que hayas causado el arrepentimiento es la medicina y para el da?o que te han causado o que tú te has causado está el perdón. Ambos deben provenir de ti, no de los demás.<br>  - Arrepentirme..... Lo estoy haciendo, no quiero que se vuelvan ha repetir esos acontecimientos en mi vida, pero el perdón.... . ?Qué es exactamente el perdón? ?Cómo estoy seguro de perdonar?. Ni siquiera sé como hacerlo.<br>  - Por eso te digo que debes enfrentar esos malos recuerdos, es el primer paso al perdón.<br>  - Lo que quiero es olvidarlos, no enfrentarlos.<br>  - No te enga?es, los malos recuerdos siempre existirán para medir nuestras debilidades y si tú eres una persona que solo quiere olvidar estas mostrando mucha debilidad. Ahora, te repito, enfrentar los malos recuerdos hace que de nuevo enfoquemos nuestros sentimientos y aprendamos a desviar los negativos, cambiándolos por sentimientos positivos.<br>  - No estoy muy convencido de eso, ahora que, ?me vas a salir con alguna lección de yoga?<br>  - Ja, ja, ja, perdona, me ha caído en gracia tu comentario<br>  - Si, por que eso de negativo y positivo, pasar al otro polo, suena como a ying yang, la lucha del bien contra el mal y esas cosas... <br>  - Ja, ja, ja, ?sabes que estás haciendo? Ja, ja, ja..... Espera, ja, ja, ja ....paro de reir, ji, ji, ji...<br>  - ?Bueno.....?Qué estoy haciendo?......!<br>  - Perdona, no quería hacerlo, ji, ji, ji, ....... no me estoy burlando,... solo me ha parecido gracioso el comentario.... ji, ji, ji.... ?Podrás perdonarme?<br>  - Bueno, ya....., esta bien, además no tengo nada que perdonarte.........<br>  - Antes dime: ?que sentiste cuando comencé a reírme de tu observación sobre el yoga?<br>  - Pues, me molesté, que mas iba a sentir !!!<br>  - ?Aún estás molesto?<br>  - No, solo fue un momento....<br>  - En este momento entiendes ?qué me cayó en gracia?<br>  - Tu tendrás tu razones para evaluar que lo que dije fue gracioso.<br>  - ?Las respetas?<br>  - Debo hacerlo, tu con tus razones y yo con las mías.<br>  - Pero me lo dices como si todavía estuvieras molesto conmigo.<br>  - No, no lo estoy, mejor volvamos a lo que me ibas a explicar sobre el perdonar.<br>  - Bien, pues te cuento que lo que acaba de ocurrir con mi respuesta a tu comentario del yoga, que por cierto, no fue la adecuada, pero, fue provocada por mi razonamiento contra tu desconocimiento. Pues bien, la vida esta llena de comportamientos causados por el razonamiento de una parte desconocida por la otra parte. Para nosotros no es fácil perdonar cuando nos quedamos en el desconocimiento y no nos preocupamos por entender el razonamiento de la contraparte, llámese persona o suceso.<br>  - ?Qué me quieres decir con todo eso? Todavía no logro entender nada.<br>  - Cuando un suceso o una persona se convierten en provocación a tus sentimientos negativos, también se convertirán en un mal recuerdo, para entrar a superar esto, debes recordar y buscar entender lo que pasó para vencer al primer enemigo: el desconocimiento, deja que tu razón te ayude, no orientes tu razón a buscar una justificación de tu comportamiento, sino a buscar una ayuda, bien sea interna o externa, para evaluar, reconstruir y mejorar los sentimientos. Si cuando lo que paso lo entiendes y experimentas un sentimiento de alivio, te va ser más fácil perdonar, es decir enfocar tus sentimientos a una actitud más positiva. Ese recuerdo ya no te hará mas da?o. Si por el contrario, tu razón te justifica para aumentar tus sentimientos negativos, estás careciendo de aceptación y la falta de aceptación siempre carece de solución.<br>  - ?Estas diciéndome, que si no tengo razones para perdonar, debo conformarme con aceptar los hechos tal como ocurrieron?<br>  - Exactamente, cuando no tenemos la capacidad para entender o la lucha para comprender, el último recurso que nos queda es la aceptación. ?Cuál prefieres? Porque tomar uno de estos elementos son necesarios para el perdón. Sino entendemos, sino comprendemos, sino aceptamos, debemos vivir con el remordimiento carente de perdón y nuestros sentimientos nunca se podrán enfocar de una forma positiva para vivir mejor nuestra historia personal.<br>  - ?Y en donde queda la autoestima?<br>  - Debes entender que carecer de perdón es carecer de autoestima, no confundas la autoestima con las actitudes egolátricas, egocéntricas y egoístas. Si realmente te estimas entra en la conquista de los buenos y nobles sentimientos|`|2af4bbfdd4b29fe2d8716956a84937c0aa	NO vale la pena arriesgar tu futuro solo por esas tonterias<br>  <br>  Sé hombre eso de que me da pena es Out y no vale la pena, comportate como adulto<br>  <br>  Entra a la escuela que te gusta y ni pex si la ves habla con ella es m,ejor quedar como amigos<br>  <br>  A poco el chiste de los noviasgos es crear enemigos si terminan????|`|2bc1d24ec6ff5c24d5b077df457b8121aa	Enfrentalo y punto, o que, toda tu vida piensas estar escapando de tu pasado?

AA11928225	As the name implies (if you understand Greek) thermogenics warm the body up.  The fact that your body now has a higher operating temperature means that more calories are burned than if you weren't taking the thermogenic product.  <br>  <br>  However, it should be noted that your body builds up a tollerance for thermogenic products and they will not be all that effective after 6 to 8 weeks of use.  So it is important to cycle off of them for at least a couple of weeks before starting back on them.  Most combine this with a carb cycling diet as well.  Low-carbs and thermogenics and high aerobics for 6 weeks.  Then no thermogenics and higher carb intake with less aerobics and more weightlifting for 6 weeks.  That way you do a period of fat-burning, followed with  a period of muscle building.  It is a 2 steps forward, 1 step back sort of approach which is supposed to leave you leaner but more muscular.  And the increase in muscle mass helps you to burn fat more effectively as well.

If you want to get pregnant, have sex about two weeks after your period to about the start of your period.  Get a home pregnancy test and check about 5 days after sex.  If you just came off the pill, you have to wait at least one cycle to get your body back to ovulating.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want a baby, then have sex up to one week after the end of your period.  More than that and you risk getting pregnant.  Of course have sex with condom to prevent any STDs.|`|AA11489215	it takes about 3-6 weeks to be able to tell if you are or not.  before that the hormone that is released when you are pregnant is not being released.  there are tests you can take a few days before your next period that claim that they work before your missed period.. if you are in doubt, call a ob/gyn

B4rVE1vhaa	To whip your body back in the shape before the baby, I suggest yoga. Many women have tried yoga and pilates and loved it. But I'm not a doctor, and I'm not sure at what point after birth it is okay to exercise. But in yoga, do yoga pushups. They are basically tricep pushups. And the position down dog can help your shoulders. Or if you have some dumbells at home you can lift. Remember though - diet. Key importance. Sure you can be in your "caloric limit" for the day, but if it's all bad stuff and not nutritionaly dense, it's not going to help you. Running is good. Running is what burns fat. Muscle helps burn fat too. The more muscle you have, the more fat you burn and the higher your metabolism. I suggest doing 3 light weight workouts once a week (They don't have to be hour long workouts) 2 ab workouts, and 1 speed interval workout. This workout regime I have just given you is from the book the AbsDiet. Which, believe me, works miracles. They have one for women too. All in all eat right, exercize, and if all else fails, see a doctor or a dietitian for further assistance.

Its a T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus (by a doctor). There is one that doesn't contain hormones (its made out of copper) that kills sperm that come into the uterus. Its over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and it lasts for at least 10 years. If you haven't heard of an IUD before try asking your doctor about them. They are very safe and widely used all over Europe and America. <br>  <br>  Except for the original procedure to get it inserted and some checking on your part, there is relatively little that you have to do for 10 years. And if you want to have a child, all you have to do is get it removed and you can get pregnant almost immediately.<br>  <br>  No pills, no hormones, no condoms...Its pretty easy and you shouldn't have any side effects at all.

Read and understand more about Whey Protien -<br>  <br>  Whey protein and high protein diet : Using whey product relates to a high protein diet which usually prescribed by a doctor or dietician and may include whey protein product or special menu, which can work out to be expensive. <br>  <br>  Weightloss High protein diet is based on replacing Two main meals with protein diets bar, soups or drinks, which makes it very easy to keep your calorie count below 1500 a day based on foods with protein. <br>  protein whey supplement can increase the protien consuption and is possible to be part of that kind of diet. <br>  <br>  protein whey usage or maintaning high protein food can work that way - because there are barely any fats or sugars involved, the body burns its fat stores for energy, leaving you leaner. <br>  <br>  Whey protein: <br>  Whey protein is the name for a collection of globular proteins that can be isolated from whey, a by-product of cheese manufactured from cow's milk. It is a mixture of beta-lactoglobulin (~65%), alpha-lactalbumin (~25%), and serum albumin (~8%), which are soluble in their native forms, independent of pH. <br>  Native whey protein does not aggregate upon renneting or acidification of milk. Prolonged heat-treatment at sufficiently high temperatures and long duration, will denature (i.e. partly unfold) the whey protein, triggering hydrophobic interactions with other proteins, and the formation of disulphide-links between whey proteins and between whey proteins and casein micelles, leading to aggregation with other milk proteins at low pH. <br>  <br>  Whey protein is commonly used as a nutritional supplement by bodybuilders and those wishing to gain muscle. <br>  <br>  High protein diet - low carb diet : Regarding a diet including a large amount of protein diet you can also look at the low carbohydrate diet (Atkins diet). It was first made popular by Dr. Robert Atkins in the 1970s, and has once again become the most popular diet trend. <br>  <br>  The Atkins Low carb diet is based on the theory that restricting the amount of carbohydrates you eat will cause your body to burn fat to obtain the energy it needs. <br>  Whey protein and high protein diets getting more and more popular these days.-

6fad9dcd0b28bbd940748b793edf7be8aa	Okay, here we go, I'll list some excercises that dont take up much space and can be done to target different pats.<br>  ARMS: <br>  first there's your basic pushups. A good way to build up your level in this excercise is to continue doing repetitions, decreasing the amount as you tire until you reach 1. eg. do a rep of 15, a rep of 14, 13 etc till you cant do anymore.<br>  Another arm workout you can do is to take a low stool or bench, and hold yourself up with your arms in a sitting position. lower yourself till your butt is just above the floor, pivoting on your heels.<br>  <br>  CORE:  If you're looking to start off easy situps are a good way to start. another excercise but one that is more difficult is sometimes called the alphabet. You lay on your back with your legs straight up(no bends in the knees!) and trace each alphabet letter, keeping your legs elevated for the entire duration.<br>  <br>  LEGS: You can work out your strength in your thighs by doing the wall sit. it involves keeping your back to a wal in a siting position, using your upper leg strength to keep yourself elevated..<br>  As for cardio, you can try mountain climbers in which you take a pushup position, and quickly assume a running motion with your legs. Dont forget to stretch well and these should be very helpful without any specialized equipment of large space.|`|4393f63c9a34f83ea9a0df442d23ff5aaa	ti chi if done properly will work your body without building on it|`|55872e79d81a6f85f7f14bf1efa2bc78aa	Running for ur legs, push-ups for ur arms and back, sit-ups/crunches for abs/stomach|`|d40afa98ee9c6cdd74de22f719a48d22aa	I've got a few, because I don't have time to make it to a gym. I don't know what kind of condition you're already in, or what you know, but here's what I like to do. Let's break it down:<br>  <br>  Arms and Chest- Best way to go is with push-ups. Those really work all parts of the arm, and they hit your chest hard too. Also, once you get good at doing them, you can start putting your hands close together, and that works the tricepts. Further away works the chest more. You can also put your feet up on a higher surface like a bed to make them even harder. These are the best exercises for the upper body. Also, to work the triceps some more, you can do dips. You just put your feet on your bed, and arms on a chair. You dip your butt down until you almost touch the floor, and your arms are at a 90 degree angle or so. For biceps, the only way to go is dumbells, but since you don't want to get weights, the pushups work fine. Just do A LOT of those, and you'll get toned quick.<br>  <br>  Back - This one's a lot harder without weights. The only thing I can think of, is if you find an area at your house where you can do pull ups. Those are a good addtion to working out the arms, but they work your back really well too. <br>  <br>  Stomach - You can do a bunch with this one. Sit ups and crunches, basic ones. Another good one to try is to lay down on your back. Keep your upperbody relaxed, and do some leg raises and don't let them touch the ground. Go up and down a few times, and it starts to burn pretty bad. There's a whole bunch of other ones as well, and you could just do a search for them on the internet if you want more.<br>  <br>  Legs - I love doing lunges! They feel good doing them, and they strech them out and build at the same time. Since you don't have weights, you can start without them, or just hold anything that weighs you down a little. Just start off standing upright, and place one foot forward. Slowly kneel down until you barely touch the floor, and then stand back up. Rotate between both legs about 10 or 20 times each, and do a couple sets. That'll make a big difference. If you do a bunch of different leg stretches, that's really good for them as well, since you won't be able to do anything harder like leg presses or squats, because you need a gym for those.<br>  <br>  cardiovascular - don't forget this! It's pretty dang important in making physical improvement. Anything from walking to running, to swimming laps. Getting your heart pumping quickly for a solid 20 minutes a day makes a HUGE difference. <br>  <br>  Oh, and also, some really important advice you should never forget is to mix up what you do! If you're body gets in the routine of doing the same exercises and stretches it gets used to them, and the improvement slows down. Mix up what you do with your cardiovascular and your stomach excersizes especially. But I strongly suggest going all out with those push ups. They work wonders, really.<br>  <br>  Well, I've got some more, but this is already long enough. Just focus mainly on push ups. Those make the biggest improvement for me the quickest. Well, good luck to you, I hope this was able to benifit you. This is what I like to do at home, and it really works out great!|`|c6ea0ac17876ab521ee09260c3e822f1aa	tybo-don't know if that is spelled right.  you can get the videos pretty cheap and they have some short versions for those of us on the go all the time.  yoga combined with pilates will work to.  but to tone all those areas at once i suggest tybo

1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	Top exercise for weight loss<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that you can lose weight without exercise. But with exercising you can speed up the process of weight loss. Exercise mainly help you lose weight in the following ways:<br>  <br>  <br>      * Burn more calories while exercising<br>  <br>      * If you exercise for longer hours, you will be able to burn calories at an high rate for an extended period after you have completed your weight loss session.<br>  <br>      * If the exercise places a high enough load on your muscles, they will increase in size, and burn more Calories even when your body is at rest.<br>  <br>  <br>  This method is an important aspect of weight loss as it makes you to burn more calories at all tiles. Muscle tissue is more "metabolically active" than body fat. With more muscle and less fat, your metabolic rate is naturally higher.<br>  <br>  Muscular variation occurs most readily when the load placed on a muscle exceeds about 60% of its maximum contractile strength. This makes weight training one of your best exercise choices, and the most direct path to a sleeker, shapelier body.|`|829dcab6465d4afe87b6c255f64f031daa	Hi,<br>  Exercises will strengthen the muscles, but you'll still have the fat.

You need to slowly ween yourself off, such as going to 3.5 miligrams then to 3 and so one. Stopping pain killers can not kill you either.<br>  <br>  However mixing pain killers and anxiety meds can be deadly. That is when you talk with your doctor as to how much you are allowed to take and stick with that, or he will inform you not to take them at all.<br>  <br>  Anna Nicole most likely probably overdosed on her meds (if that was the case) or mixed too many drugs together.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, stick with what your doctor has prescribed, and don't take any more or less, or anything else unless your doctor says so.

Users often develop a tolerance to the drug's sedative effects, though tolerance to its anxiolytic efficacy rarely develops when used at theraputic dosage levels.<br>  <br>  There is now a general consensus among psychiatrists that xanax or also named alprazolam (a so-called 'high-potency' benzodiazepine) poses a particularly high risk for misuse, abuse and dependence. Withdrawal after long-term treatment should be done slowly over a period of weeks (or even months) to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, panic attacks, rebound anxiety, muscle cramps and seizures. Some patients may benefit from a substitution with diazepam or clonazepam as these drugs remain in the bloodstream longer and have a somewhat lower risk of dependency.<br>  <br>  Patients taking a dosing regimen larger than 4mg per day have an increased potential for emotional and physical dependence.<br>  <br>  Patients who have this dependence may find it difficult to discontinue use and should seek a healthcare professional immediately so they may put you on a proper regimen to discontinue use. In addition to dependence, this medication may cause withdrawal symptoms, and in some cases has been known to cause seizures. The use of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety. When a patient discontinues use, they may experience the symptoms they had before taking medication, but this is usually short lived. Symptoms may also be accompanied other reactions including changes in mood, anxiety or sleep. Rebound anxiety is usually a result of abrupt discontinuation of this medication; patients who taper off are less likely to experience these symptoms.

2c4dc43568e50c539664b541ddc8ad00aa	I could be wrong but I beleive the two biggest dangers are from overheating, due to dehydration and increased heart rate. The second is from over hydration where you subconciously keep drinking and over hydrate yourself which is potentially fatal. <br>  <br>  Thirdly it releases a chemical into your brain called seratonin which happens naturally whenever we are happy although it releases a lot more than is normal.<br>  <br>  There are studies which have shown after prolonged use of ecstasy your seratonin levels gradually decrease which can surely only lead to one thing which is depression.<br>  <br>  Other reasons for not taking the drug is it is extremely stressful on your kidneys and heart. All it takes is for someone to have a weak heart or kidneys and it could be fatal.  The first time someone takes a drug is the most dangerous in my opinion as you never know how your body is going to react.<br>  <br>  And lastly taking that one pill could potentially ruin your life especially if you have an addictive personality. One pill turns into two which turns into more and then you go on to stronger drugs etc etc.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day it is the persons choice and as long as they know the risks and are prepared to take responsibility for their actions then there is not much more you can do except stand by them in case something does go wrong.<br>  <br>  My advice never ever touch any drug. Trust me I have seen a lot of scary things drug related and I still haven't even seen probably anywhere near the worst of it.<br>  <br>  Oh and one other thing if they are going to do it make sure they get it from a trusted source.

ECSTACY. you are in heaven, your body feels tingly, you love music, sounds, dancing, everything feels so happy and wonderful.  but once you come down from it, your life will be hell.  the day after i did it i started looking at life differently because i wanted to be back on that feeling and suddenly felt depressed that i could never feel it again (unless i took the pill). i ended up doing it about 8 times total. the depression isn't even the worst of it, weeks later i started to suffer anxiety, sleeplessness, I could not concentrate in school or anywhere else, i was always nervous and shaky.. and I know it is from the ecstacy.  it puts holes in your brain and eats away at it, every single time.  it coudl eat away different parts too so who knows what neurons you are losing.  you will feel the anxiety for months after even one time you take it.  also, you don't even know what drugs are in it.  ecstacy is manufactured by people on the streeet... drug dealers.. most likely people who have never graduated high school and can't keep a job. do you really want them mixing drugs for you that eat away at your brain?  <br>  i've experienced other drugs as well and even though they never made me feel as great as this drug, it is the one that I will NEVER do again because of the reprucussions

First of all, women will not build muscles like men, therefore, don't worry about building a huge derriere. Second of all, you want to do more reps for toning, anyway. Doing roughly 15 to 20 reps per exercise, or until you feel the burn, will greatly help out your goal.|`|AA10993379	WALK UP AND DOWN STAIRS|`|14ff6f3b709e794f421c5f9b050616f2aa	the best thing to do is lots of squats and lunges.... no you will actually shrink... lose fat and build muscle!!  good luck|`|191ee5febd3f729f792cecd54180bae5aa	Hi,   I can help you.

ed4bb5b81c3b7bd4f74afa339bc73301aa	I would truly focus on performing high intensity cardio and performing total body workouts with a little more emphasis on working out the glutes.  By high intensity cardio I mean alternating between a level you can do only for 1 minute and then lowering the level to something you can manage for 2 minutes.  That will make 1 round.  You will try to do 3-4 rounds to start out with.  Do not forget to include a warmup and a cool down.  As far as the total body workouts, you want to include exercises like squats, lunges, deadlifts and glute bridges.  The key again is to make sure your training is intense.  This will help build up your metabolism so you can burn the fat right off your butt and get it looking nice and shaped like the other picture.|`|65f9c166639a6b751531ecd41a0fc311aa	Swimming will do it.

He made sure everything I used was ok with my meds and made sure I was healthy all the way through. I had great energy all the time with the products he recommended and checked in with me every week till I lost all my weight. He explained all the products I was using and what they did. Try www.myhealthabc.com and mention the thyroid so he will tailor the samples he sends you to your particular problem. I actually lost three pounds just with the samples. I have lost 32 pounds in three months with the products and support I have used. I feel better now than I did before my thyroid problem started.

Death of a immediate family member, and divorce are just above moving.  It's normal, new place, new friends, nothing old or familiar other than what you brought with you.  If your not going to get to go home for Christmas, try and call your family.  Try and send the ones you miss the most a Christmas Card, share with them your changes, but also try and find something your happy with, for you know your family wants your happiness, along with your education.  You will make friends fast, soon, you will look back and treasure this time in your life. God Bless YOU!|`|AA11872348	Yes|`|AA12308795	Yes, especially having lived in center city Phila.

It's a kind of loss and loss can always bring about depression.   We are retired Army and moved a lot (my dad was also a career Marine).  Moving brought a lot of stress to our family and it was very depressing to leave behind friends that I knew I probably wouldn't ever see again.

And yes, I too am depressed... some days are worse than others, but what keeps me hanging on is that I know this will pass.  Your depressed mood could also be affected by the "going away to college" part of it too.    It is totally reasonable to think that this move could cause you to become depressed.

Throughout your cycle you will go fron dry to sticky to creamy to eggwhite type cervical fluid back to dry.  Really though, the best way to check your cervical fluid is to check your cervix especially if there isn't alot evident on the tiolet paper. This is also helpful b/c you will be able to feel if your cervix is high soft open and wet.  If this is the case, you will most likely become pregnant during this time.  Make sure you wash your hands well before checking your cervix as well as after.
78cdd6f9c9fbf776f1aadcf386c2cc9daa	As I'm sure you know, while taking norethisterone your period will not come, it's used to treat things like heavy periods or endometriosis and is also prescribed to keep your period away (I took it for this reason so I didn't get my period while I was having kidney surgery).<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that once you stop taking the tablets then the Dr expects you to get your period (it usually happens about 3 days after stopping the pills) and then you can start taking the Clomid/Clomiphene.<br>  <br>  While you are taking the norethisterone you will obviously not be able to get pregnant, but once you stop it then I'm led to believe that it doesn't have a massive affect on fertility after stopping it (or I wouldn't have taken it!).<br>  <br>  However, I would have a question about the bigger picture.  Why didn't you get your period for 4 months?  That would indicate to me a hormonal problem.  Has he done any other tests?<br>  <br>  Make sure that you're not taking Clomid for more than 6 months.  Studies have shown that the longer it's taken the less likely it is to help with conception, and some studies say that after this time its affects on fertile cervical mucus actually contributes to not conceiving.<br>  <br>  Listen I could talk all day about infertility, why not pop into our site and pick our brains there, or drop me a message.

If you are good in math you will find that keeping these stats in mind, 260 pounds in a year. Losing 260 pounds is the figure, which is unbelievable and unexpected.<br>  <br>  This kind of claims are planned just to cause clients to make impulsive decisions. When you gain weight, did you gained around 50 minds in two months? Certainly not. We gain weight in weight in small parts, which add up to our weight. This keeps on increasing with time.<br>  <br>  I think you get what I mean to say. We normally gain weight in grams like 65 gram per week. With this stat you are going to gain around 7 pounds at the end of year.<br>  <br>  This weight is so slow that you cannot measure it weekly. But in fur years you are going to gain around 28 pounds.<br>  <br>  So how can you expect this weight to go in few days? You are going to lose the way you have gained it.

Use natural or chemically prepared cleansers, astringent solutions or masks to accomplish this. Avoid harsh soaps that may irritate the skin or any creams that leave an oily finish.<br>  <br>  - Use a gentle exfoliant to keep the dead cells off your skin and away from the pore openings.<br>  <br>  - Avoid harsh squeezing or scraping at the blackhead. Excessive squeezing can damage the skin surround the pore and can actually increase the size of the pore leading to more blackheads in the future.<br>  <br>  - A warm compress of water applied to the area of the blackhead followed by a very, very gentle pressure can help in clearing the clog from the pore.<br>  <br>  - Commercial “blackhead strips” which are basically a tape like substance that is placed over the nose and then pulled off will remove some blackheads that are at the surface. Caution should be used with these products and it is important to read the directions completely before deciding to use the strips or not.|`|5caaddf8d4ce7415f166f75457438454aa	Hi, would you consider doing an iris scan?<br>  <br>  Did you know tat we can tell you about your health and your skin just by looking through your eyes? ;)<br>  <br>  We can tell the state of your health and well being and what is contributing to your problems by taking a picture of your iris as our body's nerves are all linked from our body and end at our iris.<br>  <br>  I am an iris analyst and from many of my clients, I have found that our skin, being our biggest detox organ, has its health and well being dependent on alot of things that may be going on in our body.<br>  <br>  Almost 100% of my clients who have skin problem see visible improvements after they rectify the weaknesses they may have that are inherent in their body.

Romance novels like to use a lot of metaphors to describe a female orgasm, but it can vary - as the nerve endings react to stimulus, it can produce a feeling like a starburst spreading through the labia, clitoris, lower abdomen, and pelvic area; a warm sensation that spreads incredibly fast; a rush of heat and pleasantly tickling feelings.  Often, women (girls) need to to stimulate the clitoris to achieve the orgasm.  The clitoris is located within the folds of the labia, right above the place where urine exits the body.  When aroused, the clitoris becomes harder and rounder, similar to a male penis.  Many girls find that it's more effective (meaning:  enjoyable) to not only stimulate the clitoris by rubbing it gently, but also to touch the sensitive areas around it - the skin within and outside the labia, along the edge of the vagina, and the inner thighs.  All these surfaces become highly sensitive during arousal.  There are other areas known as 'erogenous zones', and they can include the neck, the breasts and/or nipples, toes, fingers - it varies according to personal preference.  Also, there is the 'G-spot' - a cluster of nerves just within the vagina, behind the clitoris; it can be difficult to find, though.  Some women prefer an orgasm resulting from stimulation of the cervix.  In addition, women tend to need to feel an emotional connection to someone to be aroused - not just an image, like a picture of a sexy man, (or a sexy woman, if she is lesbian), but a sense of connection, such as imagining that sexy person is their perfect mate.  <br>  To reach an orgasm, then, often it helps to start with an image.  Visualizing one's perfect partner in a romantic setting is helpful, or reading one of those romance novels to feed your imagination!  Warm surroundings are ideal - under a heap of scented blankets, in the bathtub, with the heat up - there's a reason why cold showers are known to turn people off!  Then, you start gently rubbing the clitoris.  You can do this with a finger using the labia as a cushion, so you're not actually touching the clitoris (it's really sensitive, so finger rubbing on its own can be unpleasant).  A vibrator is also helpful, although holding it too long on the clitoris can make it numb and reduce the quality of the orgasm; touching it around the sensitive folds of the labia, or even inserting it a short way into the vagina is effective sometimes.  Your object is to keep touching and rubbing with pressure that feels good to you, so if someone else is doing the touching, be open and honest about whether they're touching the right spots and if they're using the right touch - a lover will be happier if he/she knows that you are happy, too.  Many women especially enjoy their lover's tongue applied to their clitoris and labia; it's soft, and of the same type of tissue, so it's not going to feel bad.  As the pleasant feelings get stronger, touch in a rhythmic motion; you may find your hips start moving, too.  Your muscles in the pelvis will start clenching.  Some girls find it helps to flex their vaginal muscles; this is also known as Keigel exercises, and doing so makes the sensation stronger.  It's like having a big itch and scratching feels really, really good.  It ends when you have that spreading warmth, rush of heat, or starburst feeling - like a small explosion, even, and your muscles all relax.  And you know you've had it because you're smiling.<br>  <br>  Some good media references are movies like "Better than Chocolate", many episodes of Sex and the City,  and Dr. Sue.

There is so much research out there to show that our soils are minerally deficient (since 1936 in one study), and the farmers can only afford to put 3 nutrients (N,P,K) back into the soils. Our body requires over 90 nutrients, 60 of them minerals that the body is unable to make itself. Buying organic only means it has not been sprayed with pesticides - it doesn't mean it has more nutrients.<br>  <br>  Many people are also not aware of the harmful ingredients contained in our every day personal care products. One study conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH - USA) back in 1994 showed that of the 2,983 chemicals used in the cosmetic industry (that's not just make-up but shampoo, shower gel, toothpaste etc), 884 of those were found to be toxic. Of these:<br>  314 can cause biological mutation<br>  218 can cause reproductive complications<br>  778 can cause acute toxicity<br>  146 can cause tumours<br>  376 can cause skin and eye irritations<br>  <br>  Is it any wonder there is a rising incidence of couple not being able to conceive, cancers are up (from one in 80 in the 1950's to 1 in 3 now) and most people know someone with eczema or psoriasis.<br>  <br>  There in only company I know that provide a wholistic solution for safe products and herbal suppliments. It is a simple matter of changing brands of the products you are using now. I don't buy from anywhere else.

DT5RI79raa	I have the same exact problem, torn maniscus. He said "all you had done is damaged the cartilage" ALL YOU DID? That's not like some freakin' cold you caught! You need to build the muscles around your knee so that if you take a fall again or ever apply pressure (like running) that the tension will be taken out by the muscles and not on the joint itself. You can go to your doctor or search online about the exercises themselves. I"ve been doing it for a while and I'm better now. My stepdad's knee was basically broken into 5 or 6 pieces when he was hit by a truck while bicycling. And now he plans on going skiing with me this month. Knee problems can be fixed. However, you cannot fix cartilage, it doesn't regrow - you're gonna be fine, you just have to build it before you start running like that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: DO NOT!!!!!!! DO NOT GET SURGERY UNLESS you experience your knee popping and getting stuck into place or something like this.|`|qloHZccvaa	I had damaged and torn cartilage and I have had to have 3 surgeries on the same knee for it.

In my opinion those are probably the very basic asanas (poses) which would be beneficial to every area of your body. But, Brent, try to approach yoga in a less hurried way. Try to make more time for a more thorough and less hurried practice. Try not to approach yoga with a "workout" mentality; for there are many more benefits to yoga than just the physical aspects. Hopefully you will be able to make time for deep breathing, relaxation and meditation. Enjoy. Namaste.|`|i3OCGLXQaa	Hi there,<br>  I am a beginner to yoga, doing classes on a casual basis for the past 2 years. The more i went on with my normal life the stronger my urge grew to practise on a regular basis, understanding that to be the meaning of yoga lifestyle. Searching for books and CD's/Dvd's, i realised the answer was mostly within. So i find i send 30 minutes or so every night stretching my body in the areas i feel need a stretch!!

88960da16a34e135b57eb994f0ab5df8aa	A 14 year and 11 months old (female) child<br>  who is 140 pounds<br>  and is 5 feet and 5 inches tall has<br>  a body mass index of 23.3,<br>  <br>  which is at the 81th percentile,<br>  <br>  and would indicate that your child is at a healthy weight. Keep in mind that it is still possible for a child to have an eating disorder even if they are at a healthy weight though.<br>  <br>  See the notes on BMI below if you have any questions...<br>  <br>  To interpret your child's BMI, you can also check the Girls BMI Growth Charts to see if your child has a healthy bmi. Just plot your childs age and BMI and see what the percentile is. (See our guide to Understanding Growth Charts if you are not sure what to do.)<br>  <br>  Remember, a child is considered to be:<br>  <br>      * overweight if they have a BMI over the 95th percentile for their age<br>      * at risk of becoming overweight if they have a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for their age<br>      * underweight if they have a BMI under the 5th percentile for their age<br>  <br>  And a child has a healthy BMI if it is between the 5th and 85th percentile.<br>  Try the BMI Calculator Again<br>  <br>  If your child is overweight, how much weight do they need to lose? See our articles about Childhood Obesity and use our Healthy Weight Calculator to figure out a target weight for your child.<br>  <br>  Want to find your child's (or your own) ideal body weight? Just use our new Ideal Body Weight Calculator!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The following body mass index charts are in full color and available for children aged 2 to 20 years old:<br>   <br>   Boys Body Mass Index<br>  for girls<br>    <br>  for boys<br>  <br>    <br>  adapted from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics.<br>  <br>  Notes on the BMI results (courtesy keepkidshealthy.com) or see our guide to Understanding BMI for more information:<br>  <br>  Being overweight means that you or your child has a body mass index that is above the 95th percentile for his or her age. A body mass index that is between the 85th and 95th percentile for his or her age puts your child at risk of becoming overweight. Since body mass index doesn't directly measure body fat, it is possible to be overweight but not obese. Some kids who are very athletic and have a large muscle mass, may be overweight, but if they do not have excess body fat, then they do not need help with weight loss. However, the vast majority of children who are overweight are also obese and do need help with weight management.<br>  <br>  Being underweight or at risk of being underweight means that your child has a body mass index for his age that is lower than the 5th percentile. This can be normal, especially if your child has been growing and developing normally, has a healthy diet, and is active and energetic. However, being underweight can also be a sign of a problem and deserves a full medical exam, especially if your child is not gaining weight or has recently lost weight, has diarrhea, vomiting, poor appetite, an unhealthy diet, or a low energy level. Children that are underweight can also be at risk of having eating disorders, especially if your child is overly concerned about losing weight, has a poor self body image, exercises excessively, has stopped having periods, or is using laxatives to lose weight. You should see your doctor if you suspect that your child has a medical condition causing him to be underweight or if you suspect an eating disorder.<br>  <br>  For adults, a body mass index:<br>  <br>      * over 30 is considered obese.<br>      * between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.<br>      * between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy bmi.<br>      * under 18.5 is consider underweight.|`|bRsTFGeZaa	I'm 5'6" 19 and weight 105 pounds, 34B.

In the meantime, if it bothers you that much, I would suggest wearing a high heel that covers the toes. They are just as sexy and appealing.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	The following healthy living recommendations will help you if you’re trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:<br>  <br>  *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at <a href="http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/library/weight/calsburned.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...</a><br>  <br>  Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone.

There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. <br>  <br>  *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Avoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

Anything from 24 days to 35 can be normal, and women with some conditions have an even longer break between periods. And on top of that, it's not really unusual for the length of the cycle to vary from one month to another.<br>  <br>  What helps to know is if your period is late *for you.* That means you have to pay attention for a few months to know what's normal for you - as what's normal according to a book probably won't mean much to you personally.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned, you can get pregnancy tests over the counter that can tell you even before your period is due whether you're pregnant or not.

But if you are eating healthy and sensibly, with normal portion sizes, you should be alright. Low carb is unhealthy, high in saturated fat which is not heart healthy.|`|1753c71346f07370f431105b169aebffaa	Working out is really tough if your not eating a lot of carbs, you will be tired and not have enough energy to really push yourself.  If your doing a lot of exercise you should be eating 40% carbs, 40% protein and 20% fat.  This will help you to pack on muscle, which will increase your metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  Exercise and start calorie counting. Work out your BMR and try to eat about 500 calories a day less than this.<br>  <br>  Running is one of the best ways to lose weight, cycling, swimming, rowing are also very good.<br>  <br>  Don't try to lose it too quickly, 2 pounds a week maximum.|`|4bfacf743830a81b96da83d19bf8b779aa	if people would exercise more they would not have to worry so darn much about food...Are you really serious about doing this?

Even if you lose the weight it will come right back if you do not have the desire and motivation to not only look cute but to be healthy. it is going to take alot of inner strength I can assure you of that. <br>  <br>  1.) eat 4-5 small meals a day<br>  <br>  2.) drink lots of water<br>  <br>  3.)exercise every day<br>  <br>  4.) do not eat 4-6 hours before you sleep.|`|78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	The reason that they gain it back is bc once they're done with their low carb phase, they binge eat and gain it all back. If you're going to do low carb then have a cheat meal every week so that your body doesn't get so used to the low carb pattern. Then towards the end of your low carb phase, slowly start adding carbs back in.|`|412ab642041e15cd49c2c6fd0635c61faa	Hi,  I have been a personal trainer and a bodybuilder for 25 years.

The best thing for you to do is go to a local Pilates studio that has classes and just join one class to get your form correct. That way, when you go home and watch the videos you will know what to do.
318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	It depends on what kind of working out you're doing.  For cardio, no more than 30 minutes at a time is needed.  As mentioned in the post above, some high intensity training will help a LOT, such as interval training or farlegs.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about weight training, you shouldn't train more than an hour.  More than an hour of weight training and you're digging into lean muscle for nutrients and energy (usually testosterone levels are depleted by then).  <br>  <br>  I don't suggest working out every day, whether it's cardio or resistance.  You need to allow your body a chance to recover.  Also, make sure you're getting adequate quality nutrition.|`|78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	If you're doing cardio at a moderate pace, then it is said that you do not really start burning fat until after 20 minutes of exercising. However, if you do high intensity interval training(HIIT), it's much more effective and exercising for 20 minutes woul db egood enough. If you're not familiar with HIIT, it's pretty much just sprinting for 30 seconds, and brish walking for 1 minute and you just keep repeating that either for 20 minutes or about 10 times.|`|7a712c9f1aa697b6425f4f4dcdfa8607aa	30 minutes 3x week|`|AA11109552	Cardiovascular exercise for at least 30 minutes 3 times a week at an above average pace.

I would say 2 times a day for AT LEAST 30 minutes for best results. Youll want to switch up exercises and work different areas so they dont become over tired. Twice a day takes up time and requires some dedication but for results thats what it will take. If youre not in great shape now that doesnt mean you have to kill yourself during that time your endurance will build up and you will notice a difference.|`|829dcab6465d4afe87b6c255f64f031daa	Hi,<br>  I've tried all different diets, and the weight loss is only temporary.

I get supplements for cost from a client of mine so I have tried many NO supplements.<br>  <br>  I do recommend cycling it though. Your body tends to get use to it after awhile, you don't feel that pump as much. I would say 30-45 days on, a month off.

78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	I've heard many good things about Weight Watchers. In fact, I would recommend that to anyone instead of Atkins or South Beach. Weight Watchers lets you eat the things you love, but helps you learn to eat them in moderation. You are on a point system and you can only have a certain number of points a day. Just follow the plan because being able to eat what you want in a diet is as good as it gets. Good luck!

Those calories seem a little low unless your 5' and 100lbs. How much protein are you eating a day? What kinds of foods?<br>  <br>  Here is the basic diet plan and food education I post for people:<br>  <br>  The first things you want to eliminate from what you eat are: sugar, fried foods, and white flour. You want to eat as natural and unprocessed food as possible.<br>  <br>  Sugar, anything with it is bad. From Coco-Crispies cereal, nearly all sodas, to a small bag a M&M's. All turn into body fat fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Fried foods. Chips, french fries, etc. All have very high levels of calories and fats. Cut out mayonaisse and butter while you're at it.<br>  <br>  White flour. White breads, spahgetti, Ramen noodles, most cereals, tortillas (corn & flour).<br>  <br>  You're going to want to eat 5-7 small meals/snacks in a day. That may seem like a lot of eating, but look at it this way. Say your lost in the woods and you need to make a fire that will last all night. Will the fire last longer throwing all the wood you've collected into the fire once or twice during the night, or if you toss a couple of logs in once every 45 minutes-hour?<br>  <br>  Your body is pretty similar. You need to feed it a little bit every 2-3 hours to keep it burning fat. The longer you go in between meals, the more likely your body is going to store what you eat as fat. This is because your body doesn't realize that there is food everywhere in the world we live in. It still thinks your a cave-man. And cave-men didn't get to eat very often. Sometimes once every 3-5 days...starving. So our body is designed to store what we eat as fat, because fat has the most energy (calories) per pound. So, if you sleep all night, then skip breakfast and don't eat until lunch at say 11:30am...you probably haven't ate anything in 12+ hours. So, your body thinks your starving, that there is no food to eat. Then you eat a nice, greasy, calorie-loaded slice of pizza. Your body will then store most of it as fat because it thinks there is a food shortage.<br>  <br>  Aim for 250-300 calories at each meal/snack.<br>  Also try to eat 20-30 grams of protein at each meal. And of course, your going to want to keep even healthy carbs to a minimum (less than 80 grams a day).<br>  <br>  The healthiest carbs are:<br>  Yams<br>  Oatmeal (no sugar)<br>  Sweet Potatoes<br>  Brown Rice<br>  <br>  OK carbs are:<br>  Whole-grain bread/buns/tortillas (whole-grain should be the first name on the ingredients list)<br>  Fruits<br>  <br>  Aside from the carbs listed above, your meals should consist of:<br>  Chicken breast<br>  Turkey breast<br>  Tuna<br>  Salmon<br>  Egg whites<br>  Almonds<br>  Low-fat cheese (cottage, string cheese)<br>  Lots of vegtables<br>  Lots of water<br>  <br>  You need to drink 1 gallon (128oz)minimum per day. Water is what carries the toxins and fat you burn off out of your body through your urine. It also helps keep you feeling full and does wonders for your skin. If your urine isn't clear like water, drink more.<br>  <br>  Also, take a multi-vitamin (like Centrum).<br>  <br>  If you were to do cardio like ride a bike or jog for 20-45 minutes everyday AND diet, you'll be several sizes smaller in no time. But remember, losing weight is 90% about what you eat, not how much you exercise.<br>  <br>  Bodybuilders and fitness models basically eat this way. Not only is it low calorie, low carb, high in protein and natural...it controls your blood/sugar levels and how your body uses the food based on the glycemic index.<br>  <br>  PS+ take a thermogenic fat burner also (hyrdroxycut, xenedrine, etc). Just remember to drink more water.<br>  <br>  And have 1 cheat meal a week. Gorge yourself on a couple monster burgers, pizza, or french fries...it doesn't matter. It will taste better than it EVER has and also give your mind and body a break.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can lift weights (circut train) 3x a week.|`|f84fe5dda90de4b6d5d804640b314dc2aa	of course. <br>  you should see results at the end of each week<br>  try keeping records of measurements and weights so that you can clearly see how you are doing<br>  you will not only see the difference but you should also feel the difference|`|78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	Yes you will.

Lately, all of their products have been marked including drinks that are approved on the south beach diet as well as their 100 calorie snack bars.<br>  <br>  All their frozen meals contain carbs so they would be labeled either Phase 2 or Phase 3.

78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	If you're doing HIIT on the treadmill here are the answers to your questions:<br>  1. Go for 1 minute brisk walk, I'm a girl I go about 3.5 mph and for the 30 seconds I sprint at about 7.0 mph. The point is to get your heart rate to about 95% of it's maximum. The speed may be the same for you or it may be lower or higher. It just depends on your size/age.<br>  2. Its not really a question of how far, but how long. You can go 20 minutes, or some suggest doing that 30 second, 1 minute cycle about 7-8 times.
ddd1c7f5e1a891ba69f1ae5867772158aa	Not many people believe this but the most important factor in a six pack is cardio!! No amount of sit-ups, stupid ab machines or other "spot reducing" exercises will affect it if you have fat over it. The most effective way to obtain this is tons of cardio, weight training (sit-ups of course help to make them more toned, like any other muscle) and a proper diet. This is the best way.|`|ddb892c9fb5ba41656a4c07842aad009aa	do some sit up and go to e-diets.com becuse u are going to hurt your self|`|78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	I'm not quite clear on your ab question. If there is still a little pooch and you want a six pack, you're gonna have to keep up w/ the cardio and losing body fat. My boyfriend pulled his hamstrign last year as well and was unable to do many leg exercises for a while. He recently just started doing the bike and the elliptical for about half an hour a day. <br>  <br>  I'd say about 13-15 body fat is good for a guy. If you really want to be cut, you'd have to be at about 11 and lower.

I usually drink a cup of green tea whenever I feel hungry. It helps fill me up, and if I'm still hungry after, I know it was real hunger, not just boredom. Plus, the green tea gives your metabolism a tiny boost, so you'll burn a couple extra calories.|`|AA11094078	When they suppress your hunger they also keep you up when you want to sleep which I have found very difficult to deal with daily so I stopped taking the diet pills and had a good night sleep yesterday.  keep in mind the following when you want to diet again:<br>  <br>  Dieting is difficult because we don't want to tell ourselves "NO" when it comes to choosing unhealthy foods (and yes they taste great !) and saying "NO" to the extra helping.<br>  <br>  Dieting is hard until we find out about our relationship with food.  We eat to relax, because we are lonely, excited, sad, and for comfort.  The next time you eat something, ask yourself if you are hungry or if you are just feeding a feeling .You must learn  to say no eating to the feelings but yes to hungry.  This is difficult because you will have to find something else to do instead of eating, so make a list.  Here are some tips.  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.<br>  Food-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one "specific" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.<br>  <br>  High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are "bad" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.<br>  <br>  High-fiber, low-calorie diets:  Fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  Liquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long-term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.<br>  <br>  Fasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health. <br>  No fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start: <br>  Eat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients. <br>  <br>  Get some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep "calories out" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.<br>  <br>  Include sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.<br>  <br>  Choose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more than 30 percent of your total calories as fat calories, of which no more than 10 percent should be saturated fat calories.<br>  <br>  Choose foods moderate in sugars. Foods that are high in simple sugars usually offer little nutritional value and will add unwanted calories.<br>  <br>  Choose foods moderate in salt and sodium. Remember that salt has been added to many foods during preparation or processing, so it's not necessary to add extra salt at the table.<br>  <br>  Once I learned that I mostly eat because of the way I feel and began making changes, I lost 112 pounds in 18 months along with exercising, from 263 to 151, size 26/28 to size 10.|`|1a234af3a41bd4468449392ee952ee86aa	Ashley, a sensible diet and exercise are all that you need to do.

Hoodia is an appetite suppressant. I've taken lots of diet pills and hoodia may sound great, but feeling sick while taking them is not worth it trust me. <br>  <br>  Now to suppress my appetite, I drink a lot of water as it fills me up. <br>  I also munch on fruits & veggies, those fill me up as well. There are plenty of healthy alternatives that you could eat to fill you up. Its not wrong to eat, just eat healthier foods. Cut it down slowly like drink diet coke instead of regular, have sugar free jam, eat sugar free chocolate puddings.

AA11950072	Yes, coconut juice is fattening. Just like other juice, it is very high in calories. When you are dieting, you should avoid juices all together. Instead, eat whole fruit which is much healthier. You also should never limit yourself to just one type of food. Instead of eating only fruit, you should be focusing on a balanced diet low in calories and saturated fat, but high in micronutrients, dietary fiber, and protein. Since you don't know very much about proper nutrition, you should consult a doctor or nutritionist about healthy dieting.|`|9496a414ef90ca23249dd9e31a9c8c34aa	Coconut juice is okay for a diet...but you would need to drink the certain amount that the product tells you to,coconut juice is rich in vitamins and minerals to help you loose weight while feeling good about yourself!!

But those really tone muscles are still covered by fat.  You need to do a cardio workout to lose the fat and watch your calorie intake.  Some people (like me sadly) just put weight on in their middles, so if you have excess fat, that is where it will be.  Doing the side bends and twists still work out your core muscles, which support all muscles and have other benefits, even with the love handles.  You have not done them all for nothing.|`|a69001f55cbd3bf5748b983dfe3b2b36aa	Somewhat true, you have to lose the fat there.

I lost 55 pounds after I had my baby, and only gained 19 when pregnant. Eating small meals through out the day keeps your metabolisim up, which keeps it at a constant level of breaking down food. Try to stay away from fats, keep fats down to a minimum of 36 grams a day, and calories to 1,500. Drink lots of water as well, it flushes out your system.<br>  <br>  But snack and eat things like carrots, fruit, wheat bread, keep them simple.<br>  Stop eating after 6 pm helps because your body slows down and your metabolisim does as well due to slowed activity, so what you eat after 6 pm isn't getting broken down as well.<br>  So along with that plan and some excercise everyday ie. run, walk, weight train will help you shed the pounds in no time =)<br>  Good luck!

Other than that, you're pretty much out of luck outside of starvation, which burns mostly muscle, so your body fat percentage will increase and even though your measurments might be smaller, your waist could actually become MORE flabby.  I highly reccomend a raw foods diet for the fastest result.

db67a4b2ace8d6d873c9a4f31f823bedaa	Well I would try eating healthy foods not junk food to gain some weight. Try eating more carbs like, pasta, bread, bagels and eating healthy fats like olive oil. Are you guys underweight? Or just at the thin end of your weight recommendations for your heights. <br>  Just make sure you guys are eating three meals a day and snacks if needed.

If you are young and have a high metabolic rate it's not unusual to be thin. If your parents are thin, it's more likely you will be too. As long as you are eating a healthy diet (cut down on the junk food) you are probably healthy. It's impolite for others to call you names, try to ignore it. You sound pretty normal!|`|78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	There is such thing as skinny fat. You girls maybe skinny but it's possible you could have a high level of body fat due to horrible eating habits. <br>  <br>  There are lots of girls that are your size that have gained healthy weight and ended up looking like young women.  The key is to eat more than you burn..but that doesn't excuse you to eat hamburgers and frnch fries all day. If you do that, you will gain sloppy weight..then you will look fat. If you eat healthy foods such as fruits, veggies, complex carbs, and lean protein sources, you will gain healthy muscular weight. I don't mean muscular like buff muscular. I just mean more toned. Keep in mine that 5 lbs of fat weighs the same as 5 lbs of muscle...but 5 lbs of muscle looks much smaller. <br>  <br>  So what it boils down to is...eat healthy no junk food, and lift weights.

It is good you are starting exercise, because very little will come off without it. Don't starve yourself, and eat healthy small portions frequently to keep your energy up.<br>  You will definitely lose weight on 1400 calories a day, but how quickly it all comes off really can't be measured because it all depends on how many calories you are using every day.|`|1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	It really depends how many calories you burn per day but there's no real cut and dry way to calculate that. 1400 calories is not a high intake and might even be considered low. I would suggest starting the exercise and keeping up with it at least 4 times per week. A normal rate of weight loss is about 2 lbs per week. However, if you don't normally drink a lot of water, start doing that right away, every day. This will jump start your weight loss and you'll most likely lose water weight the first week, which could have you lose more than 2 lbs that first week (I lost 7 my first week on WeightWatchers because of water). I think realistically you can expect to lose 50 lbs in 4 to 5 months if you stick with it, but don't expect to lose than much any sooner or you'll be disappointed - it takes time, but it's worth it! Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S.

You don’t have to be hungry anymore. Instead change what you eat.<br>  ·Exercise. If you are sedentary remember this the human body evolved for millions of years exercising all day chasing food. Like wild animals do today. So, exercise is in our genes and when we don’t do it we become sick. Not only fat but our mind goes wild. You better start looking for an exercise or sport you like for the rest of you life.<br>  ·The foods right for our body are the foods of the Paleolithic man found in his time. That is the diet our body was designed for, centuries before agriculture, there was no bread, no sugar, no grains crops etc. Just a few vegetables and fruits and many wild animals.<br>  ·You will have to stop taking all sodas, all vegetable oils, all fast food, no fried foods, no sweets or sugar etc.<br>  <br>  For more information go to www.omega-3-fish-oil-wonders.com pages about exercise and about diet.<br>  <br>  Alfredo E.|`|Ugq2D9AOaa	When someone is trying to lose weight they should go no lower than 1200 calories if they want to lose weight the healthy way anyhow. So your in a safe and good range. The more you weight the easier to lose weight. Someone who is 120 and someone who is 180 won't lose weight at the same rate obviously. And with consistensy you should lose 1-2 pounds per week. Its hard to count calories and often people become consumed by it. But exercise def. helps. If you stay on a 1200 calorie diet with exercise say 3 times a week ( say 30 minutes), I would guess that you could lose anywhere from 6-10 pounds per month. Remember that the results can't be seen within 3 days. Most people get fed up, and don't weight yourself so often. Try every couple of weeks. Also doing some weights help contrary to peoples opinion, it helps you burn even more fat since your muscles become stronger and more efficient and a toned body never looks bad. hope this helps. feel free to ask more question  : )

You have to eat a varied adequate and balanced diet. Your body needs all kinds of food to function properly including fat in smaller quantities though. Your body needs the nutrients and vitamins in fruits and vegetables the most, that is what you should eat the most of (at least 5 servings a day). You also need protein, and a little fat. Reduce your intake of sweets, fried food and foods that contain a lot of fat. Don't drink too many alcoholic beverages or soft drinks (they have a lot of calories). Don't go to sleep right after you eat. And finally exercise at least 3 to 4 days a week for about 45 minutes.Good luck.

Fad diets out there are just hurting your body more than helping it. And unless you are severely overweight, there is no reason to try urgent weight loss programs. Just change your diet, eating small meals and snacks all day long, not just huge meals several times a day. And since you are so busy and can't get to the gym, there are several things you can do about that. Take the stairs where ever you go, not the elevator. Park in the back of the parking lot, and walk more. Tons of little things like that help a lot!

If you have any medical problems that would prevent you from exercising etc. Also it's important to mention what you have tried and what has and has not worked.<br>  <br>  As a general rule of thumb, and this is coming from somone who's been doing gymnastics, soccer and many other sports.<br>  <br>  1. Lifestyle change<br>  <br>  To be fit and in shape it requires a certain lifestyle. One that consists of good nutrition, plenty of exercise and a good sleep schedule.<br>  <br>  Nutrition - You really have to avoid magazines, and fab diets. It's like those car dealers lying to people in ad's just to get them in the door. In the end, as with buying a car, the basics prevail. Try to avoid Saturated fats, Trans fatty acids and sugar like the PLAGUE. Skip the pop, skip fried food and go easy on the red meat. Try to focus your carbs intake on quick acting carbs and eat them in the morning and before workouts. Eating carbs at night before bed is useless since that energy will be stored as fat.<br>  Eat protein as much as you like. As far as fats, olive oil is great, so is peanut butter or any type of nut, almonds are great for protein/fat ratios.<br>  <br>  I would suggest picking up Fish oil caplets, Flaxseed oil caplets and a good Multi Vitamin. These are essential to fat loss.<br>  <br>  You really have to use your head. For example, during days I work out I keep a mental checklist when I ate, what I ate and roughly how much I can still eat without having wasted energy. <br>  I cycle my carbs and keep my protein / fat intake constant. Because on days I don't work /work out I just don't need the energy. No point eating lots of carbs on days your not active. Also it's important to eat carbs at the right times during the day, ie.. before you NEED the energy. <br>  <br>  Exercise<br>  <br>  You have to do it. Simple. Running is tried and proven, give it a whirl. Try out a 3-4 day / week schedule. Don't focus on how many calories you burn but focus on running on an empty stomach and keeping your heart rate high enough to burn anything. Don't expect results fast, just keep going.<br>  <br>  Sleep<br>  <br>  You have to sleep enough for your body to function propertly. If you screw with your sleep schedule alot its going to be difficult for your body to improve physicaly because it won't have enough rest.<br>  <br>  Oh also, please, oh god please, don't resort to starving yourself to loose weight. That's the worst idea ever. Your body will shed muscle and fat and basicaly eat itself alive. The second you start eating, guess what? All that fat will come back but NOT THE MUSCLE you catabolized! Also shock-diets are the ones that will for sure leave you with tons of loose skin! Be smart, the models fitness magazines may advertise the magic pill but believe me, their bodies didn't become that way without years of hard work. It's easy to sit at 2 am and watch that info mercial and get all geeked, what really counts is getting up in the morning and following through.|`|97b2a569758e553492a46a34f4141df5aa	Using Your thoughts, give Your body an impulse to correct itself<br>  to a normal level.

Excercise (getting your heart racing) burns calories and speeds up your metabolism to break down fats etc faster.<br>  You should be looking at trying to excercise 3 or 4 days a week for around 45 mins to an hour. The best form is jogging (on treadmill or other), and boxing. Doing small weight sessions also burns alot of calories and will help you lose weight fast.<br>  <br>  Diet is important, but as long as you stay away from too much junk/fatty foods you WILL lose weight with excercise. Try to eat at the same times everyday, and never eat after 7pm at night. NOT EVEN A GRAPE!!! .. trust me on that one. It is important when your excercising the right way, when you feel hungry - EAT. It is FACT that to lose weight, you must eat!!.. once again providing you eat the right food. Dont go completely overboard, treat yourself every now and then to something fatty :)<br>  <br>  And one last tip - it is fact that in the first 2 weeks or so of a persons attempt to lose weight, they will generally PUT ON weight before they lose it. Many people are discouraged by this and dont see themselves losing weight immediately, so therefore give up. KEEP ON GOING. <br>  I am 6'2" and weighed 100kgs, and in 6 weeks got down to 80kg, without starving or mass dieting. <br>  The more weight you lose, the harder you will have to work to lose more. You cant do the same thing over and over and keep on losing weight. As you lose weight, expect to have to work harder or you will plateau out and not lose anymore. <br>  Hope this helps :)
AA10457981	well thats all you should need.. with the barbel you should do bench presses, standing rows (where you keep your hands 4 inches from each other and pull the bar to your chin nd back down) and then do a few curls, and if u have a rack u should also do some skull crushers, very similair to bench press but the bars touches your head instead. And with the dumbells do a few curls, do some fringe presses(puttin the bar behind your head and lower and raise it) to work triceps.

But billions of Asians eat white rice daily, and the vast majority of them are not fat.

This is good.<br>  <br>  It's hard to examine your entire diet and balance it.  I love brown rice (nice nutty texture).  Perfect base for 2-3 servings of vegetables with some lean meat.  Those Nutri-system bars probably have as many calories as the entire meal that I just layed out.  However, one portion of rice is smaller than most people assume.  It's easy to overdo it with rice.<br>  <br>  I really hate those diet bars.  They are 200-300 calories a piece... but so many assume they are more than plain sugar with a couple grams of protein.

AA10912484	Dear, you're anorexic.<br>  You don't have to starve yourself to become comfortable with your body. Seriously, get someone you can trust to talk to and ask your mom to help you. You can get to a healthy state of mind and learn that your body is beautiful. Yet if you must know, the average for your weight is 100-110. You are not at all over weight. I am italian too, and I know it seems hard with all that pasta and good stuff, but seriously don't worry. Just eat healthy with occasional treats. If you want to feel better about yourself, look in the mirror and compliment the good things about yourself and you'll feel more secure.<br>  <br>  Please take my advice, because just to get this over with, here are the consequences of being anorexic:<br>  1. Your hair will start to fall out<br>  2. You'll get weaker, dumber, and tired all the time.<br>  3. Your body needs fuel to keep going, and the body usually takes from any place where they'll get enough energy to keep moving ( your muscles) and your heart just happens to be a muscle.

b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	Don't join Bally's!  I used to teach a dance class there, so I know from personal experience that they just try to get you to come in before telling you the price.  The salespeople work off of commission, so the more they can charge you, the more they make.  Right off the bat, joining Bally's costs $200 plus monthly fees.  What people don't know is that this $200 is NEGOTIABLE!  My friend talked it down to $125.  But the contract you sign is for 15 months, not just a year, if you read the fine print (after 12 months you have the "OPTION" of giving 3 months notice to cancel your membership... i.e., minimum 15 month membership).  As if that's not bad enough, think about it... with a 15-month membership, they get to charge you TWO annual fees of $75.  You think you're just joining for a year and will only have to pay it once, but they hit you with that extra $75 come month 13, and you can't get out of the contract.  If you cancel the contract before 15 months, it costs $375, so if you do the math, it's cheaper to just STAY!  Simply criminal.  That's why I quit working there.|`|AA10228017	i would go up their and talk to them,<br>  the prices vary <br>  it depends on what kind of membership you get as to what it will cost you|`|AA11459340	Ballies sucks, They screwed up my Automatic payments, and sent my name to collections for what they thought was a five dollar deficiency in what I owed them when in fact they owed me 35 bucks.

I was a member of BTF for 15 years and was not worth the money that I spent.  I became sick and tired of using outdated equipment that was never wiped down or properly maintenanced.  They have a staff of salespeople who are only interested in what is in your wallet, not in your health.  If any other gym offered me a free 30-day membership, I took advantage of it so that I can workout in a gym that cares about its members.  I will guarantee you that if you call BTF a month from now, another sales rep will answer the phone because the turnover in that company is so high.|`|f5DvqdBzaa	Be careful- I joined a BTF a few years ago (right after college) and it was not a good experience.  Their salespeople are shady, there are oftenn hidden catches to their memberships and once you start working out there, you realize that equipment is often broken for days at a time.  Adding insult to injury, it is pretty much impossible to get out of the membership, and (from what I hear) they do not hesitate to attack your credit report.

VsPnE5noaa	Signs and symptoms of genital herpes are painful red bumps on the genitals, which become fluid filled blisters. These blisters can burst and leave shallow red sores. Some people also experience headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph glands and fever.<br>  Initial outbreaks are usually more severe than subsequent ones, and generally also involve flu-like symptoms and swollen glands for a week or so. Some people also get podromal symptoms, or a tingling or burning sensation where a herpes lesion is about to appear.<br>  <br>  Get it checked out soon. If your parents won't believe you can always go to planned parenthood or your country health department. It's important to know because you can spread it to others even without an active outbreak, and you can be a drug such as Acyclovir to lessen the severity of the outbreak, decrease viral shedding and lessen the number of occurences.<br>  <br>  Going back, I just read your symptoms, and that could be anything, and I wouldn't guess herpes right away. It sounds to me like vaginitis, which could be a yeast, bacterial, or protazoan infection. Get it checked out soon!<br>  <br>  If your parent's don't believe you have herpes, they might believe you have yeast infection, which can be caused by anything from antiobiotics to tight-fitting clothes.

But if you dont really have friends or anyone how would you get the genital herpes? If you had sex ask that person and maybe ask them to take you to get checked out. I dont think your signs and symtoms check out as herpes. A lot of females itch and get a little red just becuase of soap, tampons and etc. If your discharge is yellow or grayish it is a bad sign, std. If it is clumpy it could be a yeast infection but not all women have clumpy discharge. Sometimes mens seman can irriate it as well. Are you in any pain and or bleeding? If so thats not always a good sign either.  i am NOT a doctor but i heard if you take a bath with some baking soda it might help the irration and redness.I understand about parents not understanding, which sometimes that is whats wrong with this world.

These bones are the tibia and the fibula.<br>  <br>  How Does It Occur?<br>  Ankle breaks, or fractures, can occur in many ways: for example, by falls, contact sports and exercise injuries, and force from a blow. There are many types of fractures, which determine the severity of the injury and its treatment:<br>  <br>      * Non-displaced fracture: the broken pieces of bone remain properly aligned.<br>      * Displaced fracture: the broken pieces of bone are not properly aligned.<br>      * Comminuted fracture: there are more than two pieces of bone at the fracture.<br>      * Compound (open) fracture: one end of the broken bone has broken through the skin.<br>      * Closed fracture: neither end of the broken bone has pierced the skin.<br>      * Impacted fracture: the ends of the broken bone are driven into each other.<br>      * Avulsion fracture: the muscle or ligament has pulled a portion of the bone away from where it was originally attached.<br>      * Pathological fracture: the bone has been weakened or destroyed by disease (such as osteoporosis) so that the bone breaks easily.<br>  <br>  What Are The Symptoms?<br>  <br>      * A snapping or popping sound at the time of the injury<br>      * Loss of function (hurts to move the ankle)<br>      * Pain<br>      * Tenderness<br>      * Swelling<br>      * Deformity (sometimes)<br>      * Discolored skin, or bruising, which appears hours to days after the injury.<br>      * You may experience an open wound with an ankle fracture, but this is rare.<br>  <br>  How Is It Diagnosed?<br>  To diagnose a broken ankle, your doctor will review your symptoms, ask about how the injury occurred, and examine you. He or she will also order x-rays. Several different views of the bone may be taken to pinpoint the fracture.<br>  <br>  How Is It Treated?<br>  The immediate emergency treatment for a broken ankle is to immobilize it (to keep it from moving), elevation, compression (wrapping it with an elastic or therapeutic bandage), and the application of the Medi-Temp? Hot/Cold Pack in Cold mode.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may need to set your anklebone back into its proper position and put you in a cast for 6 to 8 weeks. If the fracture is not too severe, you may be able to walk in the cast after a short period. If the anklebone cannot be aligned perfectly before it is ready for a cast, surgery will be necessary.<br>  <br>  In the first 2 to 3 weeks after the broken ankle, be sure to keep your ankle elevated on pillows and place ice packs on top of the cast for 20 to 30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours to help reduce swelling.<br>  <br>  You should also:<br>  <br>      * Make sure the cast does not get wet. Cover the cast with Shower-Beauties? watertight shower and bath covers when you bathe. They may be found in the Bathing, Living and Mobility Aids Section of our website.<br>      * Use crutches or a cane, as directed by your doctor. He or she will tell you how much weight you can put on your ankle, if any. See our great Fashion Canes and how to choose the right one for you in our Bathing, Living and Mobility Aids Section.<br>      * Not scratch the skin around the cast or poke things down the cast. Check out “CastBlast?” a unique cooling under cast spray that will stop the itching and reduce moisture under your cast, keeping your skin safe and scratch free.<br>  <br>  Immobilization of a broken ankle in a cast can cause the joints to stiffen and the muscles to weaken in both legs. After you come out of the cast, your health care provider or physical therapist will recommend exercises for both ankles that will improve their strength and range of motion.<br>  <br>  How Can I Take Care Of Myself?<br>  To Help Take Care Of Yourself, Do EVERYTHING Your Doctor Advises And Prescribes. Also, Follow These Guidelines:<br>  <br>      * Eat a variety of nutritious foods. Now is NOT the time to visit junk food central! Giving your body the nutrition it needs to heal is essential at this time. Did you know that it’s not uncommon for people to gain from 5-25 pounds during the recovery period?

This will help control pain and swelling.<br>      * You may place ice packs or the Medi-Temp? Hot/Cold Pack in cold mode over the cast for 20 to 30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for the first 2 to 3 days. Take care not to get your cast wet. Wrap the ice pack in plastic or a clean dry cloth. Or, better yet, cover the cast with Shower-Beauties? watertight shower and bath covers before icing the cast or bathing.<br>      * Do not scratch the skin around the cast or poke things down into the cast.

hnEyx0Vbaa	These tonsil stones are essentially any material which becomes stuck near the tonsils, which are structures in the back of the throat. Fortunately, they are rather rare. I have never had one nor has anyone who I know. They are generally treated by simply removing the stones with a jet of water or a long Qtip-like device.|`|XzijwPquaa	I've never had this before, but as I read the wikipedia page, ... well, the webpage describes about it thoroughly, so you shouldn't have any problem knowing what it is.

The one above mine is most accurate, and I applaud her for her correction!|`|5536ad80b75f74649f3c5b312315c1e8aa	yeast infections can be caused by many things. Soaps, douches, tampons, dirty hands inserted in vagina, dirty toys,a dirty dick *  not cleaned, funky smelling and not meaning stds which unless you doctor said it is a yeast infection it could be something else*  and etc. A man can get a yeast infection if he has unproteced sex and in some cases if the yeast is on the outside you still might have a change of getting a yeast infection or just a little rash because it is someone else bodily fluids and that yeast infections were not intentionally for men. He needs to go to the doctor and let them know your gf has a yeast infection let them know becuase they may treat it as a std and i know for women antibotics make a yeast infection worse but  they will give you cream and antibotics. you will be okay. it could be worse.|`|cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	First off, you don't get yeast infections from being dirty, those other answers are incorrect. Bacterial infections are caused by uncleansliness or by coming in contact with something with bacteria. Yeast infections are caused by horomone imbalances that are sometimes as a result of sex. Anything can cause the PH to become inbalanced, ie very perfumy soaps, powders, sprays. Or sometimes medications can cause yeast infections or health issues like diabetes. Men can get them as well, (only through sex), but very uncommon. If she in fact has one, put some monostate on you as well if you feel you have one. You will have a lot of itching and burning. Bt highly unlikely that you have one.
AA11798408	Hi,<br>  <br>  answer is - yes and yes<br>  <br>  also - very loose fitting pants or sweats <br>  <br>   - you will probably have a large incision about half way between your belly button and pubic bone so you will not want anything pushing on it<br>  <br>  also,  shoes you don't have to tie - you will not want to bend over and you will not want to walk the hospital halls in the paper slippers they give you<br>  <br>  walk a lot - gets you back to health quicker and remember you CAN"T lift ANYTHING till doc says it is ok<br>  <br>  J<br>  wife had same procedure for same reason|`|AA10792539	They wanted me to have this surgery over a year ago because I have the biggest fybroid that they have ever seen but I didnt go through with it.I am hoping that menopause shrinks the tumor so that it can be lasered away.I've read that many more people die from the surgery than from fibroids.You are brave,,I am not.|`|49bd931c71c18604589c21a2cd7b3eccaa	I also have fibroids and need to have a hysterectomy but keep putting it off. I don't know much about it yet but I would think you would probably have to use a maxi-pad for a little while. You will have to get up and walk around before you go home so taking a robe would be a good idea. I have had a c-section and trust me, getting up and walking around totally sucks but the more you do it the better you will feel. Sorry not much help but I hope this surgery makes you feel better than you have in a long time. Good-luck and get plenty of rest.|`|866e5b2f87925ecac281dde9d5af11a7aa	Too bad you had not asked this a bit sooner.<br>  <br>  There's a wonderful hysterectomy support site online that would have helped you with your pre-op questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hystersisters.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hystersisters.com</a><br>  <br>  The site will come in handy once you're back home from the hospital. Be sure to check it out.<br>  <br>  I had my hysterectomy (horizontal abdominal incision) 7 weeks ago. I was up within 24 hrs and home within 48.<br>  <br>  I did take a robe and used it when I got up to walk around the hall. Be sure to get up and walk around as it helps with gas issues after surgery.<br>  <br>  As for answering question about bleeding, it depends on what type of surgery you have.<br>  <br>  I was told I might have some bleeding post-op, but I never did. But other women who have had same surgery have.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different so one person's experience may not be what you experience.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your surgery ... take good care!|`|AA11943102	Yes, you do have to get up and walk around before you are released but typically that won't happen until the second or third day. I took a robe just to help keep warm (hospital blankets suck LOL)<br>  <br>  The bleeding will depend on how well your surgery goes. You may have a little, you may have a lot, or you may have none at all. No one can really say until you have the surgery.<br>  <br>  I didn't have any problems until I got home. My best advice to you is to make sure that you obey the weight restrictions because that will strain the muscles and cause you to bleed.<br>  <br>  Also, don't be afraid to ask for painkillers. If one doesn't work, ask for a different one. And tell them if it doesn't work. You have nothing to lose by having them help alleviate your pain.<br>  <br>  I would also bring some loose fitting pants and a loose draping dress with you for when you go home. I wasn't able to get the pants on, but I was able to wear a loose jumper home and that helped a lot.<br>  <br>  And when you get picked up, who's ever picking you up from the hospital should bring a couple pillows to help pad you in. And they should pick the least bumpy route.<br>  <br>  Feel free to messenger me if you have any other questions. My surgery was due to cancer, but it amounts to the same thing. Hopefully this helps you!|`|c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	My mother had a hysterectomy for the exact same reason.<br>  <br>  She had residual bleeding for about a week, maybe a bit longer.<br>  <br>  She also took a robe to the hospital, but did not use it overly much as she stayed in her room until she went home.|`|hSvQqSRqaa	Well my mom had one about 5 years ago and yes u will have bleeding after so i would bring some and if u want to bring a robe u can if not u will be in the hospital gown. And yes i think they made her walk. Good luck with ur surgery! Hope it goes well!!|`|0f38f7af13e88dca8c7c31f0d752066daa	hello im 32 and just recently went thru this about a yr ago, i did have some bleeding and discharge which was normal from this for about a week or so. when i had my surgery i didnt bring a robe and i did walk around some in the hospital because they do advise you to do that. i had my hysterectomy for polyps in the uterus. and depending on which way they go thru on your hysterectomy as to your recovery time. i think i was back to work in 6 weeks. and if they dont tell you sometimes after getting all healed and what not when you finally are able to tolerate intercourse you will bleed some and dont freak out cause thats normal. good luck and my prayers go out to you....|`|ICR4vTDuaa	yes there will be some bleeding, and you should bring your own robe or something comfortable.  I had a hysterectomy years ago, and I was opened side to side.  You will do fine, God bless and put angels on your pillows.|`|g6MVYy9faa	I have had a hysterectomy but it was when I was 29 due to cancer and I did bleed but it was only for two days . My sister just had one and she is 50 and she did not bleed after 1st day so I think it all varies . yes you do have to walk it helps relieve the tightness . after a few walks it gets much better  .

AA12007347	Do some weightlifting to tighten up the stomach. The easiest and cheapest way is to buy a couple of 5 gallon pails, put some water in each. Pick them up off the floor, HOLD them for 1 minute, bent over a bit, elbows bent a bit, knees bent a bit. Do ever other day. Tightens up the stomach, and every thing else!<br>  Once a week, add some more water. Pails should feel heavy after 30 seconds, should not feel heavy the instant you pick up the pails; then too heavy!! Take out some water and try again.|`|06a5b4be000ee041a4e5da71aa1db2d8aa	read tips on some great workouts to help you tone up on this site|`|GzObucaKaa	This is the best way.<br>  <br>  Tricep dips  <br>  How to do... tricep dips <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Dips are a fantastic way of improving the definition in your arms. <br>  <br>  But be warned, they're not easy! <br>  <br>  Dips are an extremely good all-round exercise. <br>  <br>  They work the biceps, triceps, shoulders, lower back and abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  STEP ONE<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Position yourself between a set of parallel bars. <br>  <br>  If the apparatus has foot rests, put your feet there. <br>  <br>  Lift yourself so that both of your arms are straight. <br>  <br>  Make sure your elbows are at your sides. <br>  <br>  Bend your legs at the knee - but don't cross them. <br>  <br>  <br>  STEP TWO<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Lower your body down as far as possible.

No sólo se produce el adelgazamiento con la combustión de las grasas, sino que la actividad física estimula las endorfinas,y éstas producen una sensación de bienestar que calma la ansiedad y por lo tanto el deseo de comer disminuye.<br>  Tomar bastante agua está bien, pero no es suficiente.<br>  Trata de por lo menos en el desayuno reducir los azúcares, no comer manteca, sólo mermelada dietética o queso descremado. <br>  Hacer una colación entre comidas: gelatina, una fruta, un yogur descremado. Esto va a colaborar a que en el momento de hacer la comida principal no estés tan hambriento.<br>  No comer fritos, ni enlatados, ni fiambres, tratar de cocinar los alimentos al vapor o a la plancha, sin agregados de aceites o grasas.<br>  Nada de comida chatarra, ni chocolates y golosinas entre comidas.

AA11724685	Hang upside down off your bed, with your head hanging off the bed.

It makes my face red.  Or, or go out in the snow for a long time, shovel in the snow would be the best way i guess.|`|5f7870fbdb7c8782dc6d264406cfb742aa	Pinch your cheeks.  Old fashioned blush.|`|AA10638825	I wish you had more info about why you need it to be red. I would suggest getting an over the counter face peel...your face will be red for sure for at least a few hours. Another great idea is going to the tanning bed for 15 minutes and getting a nice old fashioned sun burn. One time for 15 minutes will make your face red for more than just a few hours.  Of course you could buy some rosy red blush or the rosiest shade of bronzer possible and dust it all over your face....but you will need to retouch it depending on how long you need your face red for. Hope this helped you! Good Luck.|`|adcfd743e0209e56cb4cda5e4cb00524aa	Stand on ur head|`|bTY7zjwfaa	use red blush or red finger paint or some thing that colours ur face.|`|AA11586320	Hold your breath!

Now, i know that you probablly hear this a lot, but YES, cutting urself is totally bad for you. I had a cousin named Justin and he was (i guess how the kids describe these kind of people) "emo". He wore darker colors, painted his nails, was bisexual, and yes. He even cut himself. His mom, Anne, couldn't stop him, because she didn't know. Me and her (anne) found him in the bath tub in the master bathroom dead. He had slashed his rists all up and just laid in the tub as he waited to die. He totally succeeded. <br>  <br>  So... do you like the sound of that? I don't know about you, but to me, that sounds painful and even sort of scary. That's how a lot of teens (i'm guessing you are a teen) start out, cutting themselves... but then it turns into something worse... like what happened to my cousin. I don't usually talk about him... but in your case, i will open up all the way.<br>  <br>  Now... to stop. First of all, if you hang around with the wrong crowd (i'm guessing emo kids or some one else that cuts themselves) then stop. Try to make new friends. Now... i know this sounds almost impossible, but if you want to get better, you have to do this. If ur cutting urself up because of a boy... then try not to think of him as much. don't call him or anything. If you see him at school, say hi, but let that be the extent of ur mingling. Find things that make you happy... stuff that you like to do. Example: tennis, horseback riding, art, dancing, softball, etc. Art seems to be very good for people in ur situation. Art (especially drawing and painting) lets you express urself. Try this to let ur emotions out instead of cutting urself. <br>  <br>  Also... get out more... find stuff to do with ur parents. If you and ur parentals don't get along... try. try to make it work. Obey them, clean ur room, etc.<br>  <br>  But definately find a hobby and try to do things that make u happy. Find ways to express urself (art) instead of cutting.<br>  <br>  IF YOU NEED ANY MORE HELP... FEEL FREE TO ASK! YOU'LL BE OK, TRUST ME. JUST LISTEN TO MY ADVICE.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU CAN... TRY TO STAY OFF MEDICATION... DON'T LISTEN TO HER... SOMETIMES MEDICATION CAN HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS. TURN TO MEDICATION AS A LAST RESORT.

b6f151d22968bb6b096edc46ea223f85aa	I would like to know too. jk, I think if it was an intense workout system , on average you will lose a certain amount  of weight. I don't think a person can lose a consistent amount of weight each month, it varies.|`|c7b55e12652f4ec81f89aa3a6ff9c9eaaa	It's possible but the normal amount of weight loss should be 1-2 pound per week.

The natural chemicals in the pills burn stores of fat as energy and increase your metabolism.............

4cc66a756d33e365e8b6cb39cd46f4fcaa	There is no relationship between an ovarian cyst and ovarian cancer.<br>  Almost all women have an ovarian cyst at one time or another.  Usually, we just don't know about it, because they usually resolve on their own.<br>  <br>  3.5 cm really isn't very big.  Nobody would want to operate on that, unless it persisted, and did not resolve.<br>  Free fluid around the cyst could indicate that it ruptured.  That's not a bad thing -- it's the normal process.  Once it ruptures it goes away.<br>  <br>  Usually ovarian cysts are managed expectantly, which means "wait and see."  If it grows, then it may need surgery. If it goes away, then great.<br>  Sometimes oral contraceptive pills are given.  This hormonal cycling can help a cyst to resolve.<br>  <br>  Finally, let me reassure you that a cyst looks different from cancer on an ultrasound.  A cyst is fluid-filled, and looks black.  Cancer is a solid mass which is grey and not well-defined.<br>  Talk to your doctor (NOT the emergency room people) about how to manage this.  You really do not want unnecessary surgery.|`|kCOCyKataa	If you are worried that much, I would go see someone now.  It is always good to get a second opinion on these sort or things anyway.  <br>  <br>  You could still go back to the regular doctor too, in a month, after getting your second opinion.|`|AA11931076	For a cyst of this size ayurveda has simple medicines and panchkarma treatments. no surgery is done. meet a nearby ayurvedist. even homeopathy has simple solutions.|`|PBcanNkBaa	ive had a cyst close to what your describing and it landed me in hospital. usually these pass and that generates the abdominal pain that youve described. If its this big and they are waiting for it to grow id get a second opinion cause usually they have to be removed surgically especially if they dont pass.|`|Z1CkGZFSaa	I wouldn't wait another month.  I just had surgery for the very same thing on November 23, 2006.  I can't even imagine your doc telling you to wait!  Especially going through another period with it in there, its so painful!  Don't wory about ov cancer, in most cases they are not.  I was worried also waiting for test results, but if you also had blood drawn as part of your testing, your white cell count would have been through the roof if there was some kind of cancer.  If they didn't draw blood, then request one.  Don't settle with what a doctor tells you if you're not comfortable with it.  Get another opinion.   The surgery was not  bad at all, it was outpatient, and I was back at work 5 days later.  Good Luck!|`|jXBSfkqTaa	I would suggest having it taken out soon. I had been having cramps for a couple of years and dr suggested an ultrasound when I finally went. I had a cyst bigger than my fist! It was benign(dermoid cyst) as most are.

YTbygkE1aa	I'm a nail technician, I have been for 7 years, I find that using vicks vapo rub, rubbing it all over your feet, and always using a GOOD foot file, not a cheapy one, OPI makes a great foot file, daily will help too.  But really, those callouses and hard spots are on your feet for a reason, they are protecting you by the way you stand, or how you walk, and the amount you are on your feet.  Lather up with Vapor Rub (even cheap kind), put on some good coton socks, and go to sleep!  Vicks vapor rub also helps in the healing of toe fungus, athletes foot, etc.  Good Luck!

AA11387869	Yes there's help, and yes I did have this problem too.  You need to go to a doctor (or ER) to be diagnosed.  They can determine if medication would be of benefit to you--and they can get you started with therapy--to get to the root of your problem--that's what stops it.|`|QbexYHbcaa	OCD Disorder?

zAkPpIjaaa	we are about the same size(height and weight) and I thank my lucky stars that I am at this size now because about 3 years ago I weighed almost 200lbs. lol. I lost the weight by not eating any bread/pasta/sweets at all for about 3 months..within that time frame I lost 30lbs. So, you can do it! However, I wouldnt reccomend you losing 30..that seems a bit much. The most I'd really like to lose right now is maybe 10 or 15. Restricting carbohydrates takes a lot of discipline and you have to really, really have the will to not give in to cravings or eat late night or anything. I still drank soda though..not diet but regular soda..that was my only "allowance"..it worked for me..try it if you want.

If you continue to take acidic food, even with exercise you cannot get rid of fats. Therefore you must solve the weight problem at the source : eating acidic food. By taking alkaline food, you prevent the intake of acid to create more fats. Besides doing exercise, you must eat only alkaline food.<br>  Read the book "pH miracle for weight loss". See photos of people losing weight at ease. If you want to loose weight super fast, there is an alkaline liquid diet. According the book, people are loosing 10 pounds or more within the first 8 days. Go to the website below to see which food (and even fruits) that are acidic.

This gives the muscles enough time to repair themselves between workouts.
RiKXT43Jaa	a normal tsh reference range should be between 0.350-5.500. so actually if you go by the book you are within normal range.  also hypo thyroid (which would cause tiredness and many other symptoms) would be considered over 5.500 and anything under 0.350 would be considered hyper thyroid. so your very far from being hypo. so i don't think your tired from your thyroid. have the dr check your iron levels too. if everything else is normal...i would try taking a multi vitamin everyday.|`|clwGEwZuaa	i have an underactive thyroid gland and my results come back normal, even though i am so tired. the doctors are checking my iron levels. so the next time you are there you could suggest this.|`|SbJSBzsWaa	Your better off going to an H.R.T. doctor who does bio Identical horemone replacement therapy. I'm sure your doctor didn't bother checking your free t-3 and t-4 levels. You can do basil testing and check you own temprature. If it is always well low below 97.0 You need and herbal thyroid activator and raw thyroid. If its just low in the morning you can problably use an herbal thyroid support formula. Potassium iodide helps boost the thyroid gland most people are low in Iodine. Just don't over use these formulas and look around for a good Holistic health practitioner in your area to monitor you so you can do this safley. To much thyroid formulas even natural ones can over stimulate the thyroid gland and cause nervousness and heart palpatations.<br>  I myself take armour thyroid or one by standard proccess. Natures sunshine makes a good thyroid activator. Gotu kola is good for energy and sublingual B-12. I hopes this info helps<br>  Helene / Folk healer / CRMT

Doing this for 7 days should make a pound drop off (3500 calories = 1 pound of fat). <br>  <br>  As for low calorie snacks, just type that into google or yahoo and you'll get tons of hits, some examples are:<br>  90 calorie granola bars<br>  banana (~100 calories, great for fiber needs)<br>  apple (~60-100 calories)<br>  celery<br>  handful of nuts<br>  a couple crackers (salt adds sodium though)<br>  bear<br>  strawberries<br>  blueberries<br>  carrot sticks<br>  <br>  Here's a sample of what I eat in a day (I've lost about 8 pounds over the last 4 months...a healthy amount for my body)<br>  Breakfast:<br>  yogurt, glass of juice, piece of toast with jam<br>  <br>  Lunch:<br>  spinach with feta cheese, orange (or apple), water<br>  (you can also have other veggies, lean pockets are good, salads, sandwiches, etc)<br>  <br>  Snack:<br>  Granola bar (special K or the other 90 calorie ones)<br>  apple<br>  banana<br>  celery and pb<br>  <br>  Dinner:<br>  pasta with sauce, sprinkled cheese over it, milk<br>  or<br>  rice with stir fried veggies, milk<br>  or<br>  small bowl of pasta (not large like above), salad, milk<br>  <br>  hope this helps, good luck, remember to eat well (don't just eat nothing, eat good calories) and exercise for the best combination!|`|26TUxtShaa	BREAD: AVOID<br>  ALL CARBOHYDRATES: AVOID<br>  RICE: AVOID<br>  FRIES: AVOID<br>  HAMBURGERS: AVOID<br>  <br>  try Atkin's diet. <br>  <br>  <br>  best low carb snacks for dieting: Pork rinds although I must say many people do not like them.

z5h7uetraa	You need to get something that will clean you on the inside.  Herpanacine is the name of the product that I use. It is a dietary supplement with antioxidants It can help someone with almost any skin disorder because it cleans you from the inside.  I started to use it to get rid of acne and saw amazing results.  I am sharing this information with everyone because I suffered for years with acne.  I was 24 and could not find anything that worked.  I went to GNC in search of vitamin that would help me and the woman working introduced me to this product.  Herpanacine was definitely the answer.  This product is very good for acne and scars it might leave behind.   This product also helps to prevent you from getting acne. They also have products to clean your face.  Guess what?  I don't even have to use them.  The vitamin did the job for me.  I hope this helps you the way this helps me. :-)|`|eZZYfWPHaa	as for home remedies i would say toothpaste i can swear by that one.. also i would call up Ur dermatologist for some creams|`|kKsiWUcZaa	Diet, Diet, Diet, drink lots of water, dont eat greasy foods like burgers, and any form of fat.

What you eat is so about what your face is telling you|`|rGQWVlCPaa	I was really successful with Accutane, however, I think that is only for very severe cases.  <br>  <br>  My son has had great success with Glycolic 10% toning complex (by RXtras), followed with 5% pure benzyol peroxide (applied directly to outbreaks).  Hope this helps!|`|p5wTtH3taa	The best (and one of the least expensive) things you can do for minor acne is to use Clean and Clear 10% Benzol Peroxide.  I used many times, and you get results in no time.  Within a day you will notice the redness gone, and the blemishes start to fade.  Be advised, if your skin is very sensitive, keep an eye on it, and if you get a rash, consider seeing a dermatologist.  The best thing they can supply you with is Accutane(c), which is used when other treatment fails.

2q1XI0j9aa	To lose fat you need to eat lean meats (chicken, fish, turkey, lean beef) , eggs, low gi fruits (apples, bananas, pineapple, oranges), green veggies (broccoli, celery, green lettuce, spinach), only whole wheat breads (look on the package and see if the first ingredient is whole wheat flour, if it is it should be good unless it has high fructose corn syrup like Mrs Bairds does). Jillian Michaels from biggest loser has a great quote, "before you eat your food ask yourself, does it have a momma or did it come from the ground? If not don't eat it." Eat 5 - 6 small meals a day, this will increase your metabolism and help you to not feel so hungry in between meals. Its all about portion and calorie control regardless of what food you are eating, but remember cleaning up your diet and eating X amount of calories of lean good healthy foods instead of X amount of calories of candy bars (I know you are probably not eating 4 candy bars a day but its just an example) will help you lose it faster. The leaner you are eating the faster you will lose it, and you will get a toned healthy look instead of a skinny jiggly look. You also need to drink at least 8 glasses (8oz) of water a day. Sometimes hunger is mistaken for thirst so if you are hungry drink 8 oz of water and wait 30 minutes, if you are still hungry then eat a light healthy snack. Water also helps you feel fuller longer and helps flush out toxins that may prevent fat loss. Also allow your self a cheat day (but dont go over board and eat everything in sight or like 5 cakes in that day). Allowing yourself a cheat day once a week will help cut out cravings Think of it like a reward if you did well with your diet and exercise that week have a piece of pie If not just stick with you healthy food. You can find recipes for decent tasting healthy foods on sights like bodyforlife.com and bodybuilding.com and also on recipe sights like allrecipes.com, foodfit.com, cookinglight.com and foodnetwork.com    You need to do a good mix of both cardio and strength training, strength training is not going to make you look like Arnold, I promise (unless you are taking test). Toning and building muscle strength will help you lose fat quicker as you will be burning calories all day to feed your muscle tone instead of just while you doing cardio activity and it increases metabolism. Running, walking, rollerblading, swimming are good cardio work outs. You can also get some at home videos. I personally like Gilad's Kick boxing, Cathe Friedrich, ten minute solutions videos (ten minute solutions are good because they have 5 ten minute segments and you can do one or all five or three or what ever you want to do at the time and they have a variety, like dance, pilates, yoga, etc.). Also if you get cable/satellite, find the Fittv channel and scroll through the guide and see if anything sounds interesting and do it or record it if it doesn't fit into your schedule at the time the program comes on. Get your self some 5 pound dumbbells or a gym member ship and do bicep curls, push ups, sit ups, squats, dead lifts, lunges, tricep over head extensions, chest presses, shoulder presses, etc. You can do most of this on your own if you just go and buy some free weights, but a gym membership is helpful as well. If you do end up getting a gym membership I would consult a personal trainer (most memberships come with a free session) they can show you what to do and come up with a meal plan for you... You can find the videos I mentioned on the web at collagevideo.com, or at ross (cheap cheap at ross) or walmart or any other place that sells dvds.    Lastly, don't get discouraged, it takes time (it didn't didn't get there over night, its not coming off over night)... you should be losing 2 pounds of fat a week safely, more is not typically safe. but you could gain weight especially if you are gaining muscle. So if you get on the scale and it says you've gain two pounds don't freak out... just look in the mirror and go by how your clothes look and feel on you. Hope this helps! email me if you have any other questions!|`|ixOE0onnaa	how about exercise, eat vegetables like carrots, corn ,and spinach, some fruits. and use a food table that helps. use 2000 calories a day. eat right. do sit ups that help my mom lose 99 pounds my mom lost. run allot helps too there should be ketchup on stakes with few calories.  you should eat 2 a day. eat a salad note not too much. if you want too do it too july do 3 easy steps that what i did. or you can take Limousin.
7o3DMzXQaa	you don't have to be diagnosed before 7 but many elementary schools will offer testing around that age. just go to your doctor but believe me it's nothing you can't overcome with hard work. doctors just want to throw pills at everything|`|XSTjyO1naa	No one can guide you better that whether you have ADD or not, you must see the Dr and relate this problem, he can better suggest you. Many of us can identify with the difficulty involved in focusing on a homework assignment or a household chore when we are preoccupied with a more pressing emotional matter; however there is a growing number of people who find it nearly impossible to focus no matter what state their emotions are in.The actual symptoms of this disability vary with the individual, but it is important to recognize two things.  The first is that ADD attention deficit disorder is a disability, not a defect in temperament.With a combination of medication, behavioral therapy, and membership in a local support group, those who suffer from ADD attention deficit disorder can come to control their inability to focus--thus, becoming productive members of their community.

When you suddenly stop consuming it after a period of time, the body is sure to go through some withdrawal symptoms.

ikbHM3tUaa	There are numerous different classes of medications for insomnia. Just to throw some out there, have you tried (in no particular order):    Sedative-Hypnotics (older class, not recommended): Like Phenobarbital. Benzo's such as Ativan, Xanax, clonopin (generally not recommended either). The most effective agents are probably: Ambien, Lunesta, or Rozerem. Anticholinergics are also often used(they are sedating): amitriptyline, benadryl, OTC products containing Doxylamine. Sometimes physicians prescribe anti-psychotics off-label as sleep-aids/anti-agitation as they are very sedating too (seroquel, zyprexa).    There are some homeopathic treatments you should consider as well, such as melatonin, valerian, tryptamine-rich substances etc. Not really my strong-area though.    Generally I would recommend lunesta or rozerem, but they are really expensive. Ambien is generic and works well too, but it can cause dependence. The other treatments generally work but arent preferred becuase of dependence, and side-effects.    I hope everything works out, ask your pharmacist for help!|`|t9IrZHqJaa	I'm not a doctor, but many of my patients in the pharmacy have reported sucess with melatonin products.     If that doesn't help, you should contact your doctor, because there are many prescription medications out there that will do the job.    Hope that helped. Good luck!

It's fine.  It's normal.  You're just growing up.  A natural part of any young woman's life.    You don't HAVE to have sex.    You DO have to have puberty though. It just happens.    And beleive me, when you get older, you'll find this post a little silly.  Because it all isn't as scary as you think it is. It's fine. You'll be fine.    Since it's your body,  just know that you don't have to have sex if you don't want to. Alright?    I hope you feel better.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	Yeah its called puberty. Your body is going through a series of changes, most of them being chemical and hormonal. Its good that you don't desire to have sex right now. At 14, there are so many other things to be concentrated on like, school, and your future. When you are ready to have sex, you will know, In the meantime, you are going to have urges and be aroused by things, its totally normal.|`|cc1eedd4ec08792a3946f30dd974c11faa	yep|`|zidiYWU1aa	You are completely normal.   when I was growing up I wasnt sure about certain sensation (down there) either. It did scare me at first. You are way too young to have sex. Sex is for adults who are deeply in love because with sex comes many emotional attachments and mistakes do happen like getting pregnant or catching STD's (sexually related diseases)   It is better to wait until you are an adult and until you can truly understand your body.
mh0MJz1faa	You can't really know, because the companies that market them are not regulated by the FDA.  The herbs may not be fresh or potent.  The best way is to grow your own herbs or buy them in raw form in bulk and store them tightly sealed in jars, and then make tea out of them or put them in gel capsules.  BTW, echinacea works better if NOT taken daily-- save it for when you feel like you're coming down with a cold or something.|`|DS2Oxpsbaa	Wow, there are so many herbs out there, it's really hard to answer that question.  Why not ask the person who you are buying them off of to see which herb is the best?? And honestly, I really doubt herbs are any better than vitamins.  There's actually a term for an expert in herbs. . .an herbologist I beleive.  Maybe you can hunt one of them down.  Try doing a google search, and just record all of the answers you find.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.|`|dd77fb3563366e040cc1b2086fade107aa	GNC is one of the only companies that offers "standardized" doses of their supplements.  They cost a little more than their regular supplements, but you're guaranteed to get the same dosage each time.
xvey8ixPaa	You should call the doctor's office and ask them. Tell them what you wrote in here. The fact that you do not like your glasses is not the point. The contacts caused a medical issue that you do not want to return. If it is not treated correctly you can cause yourself to not be able to wear contacts at all in the future. Each case is different. Only the doctor that saw you will know the answer to this. Do not risk your health because you do not like your glasses. It is just not worth it. I am not being mean, just realistic. I see a lot of this in the practice that I work for. Call your doctor and do what they tell you to do! It is in your best interest.
BHP1gFgiaa	i have never heard of it where did you get the info i am b too so what does the diet intail why did you not stick to it before ????|`|QIv9jeJ1aa	our blood types have diets???|`|1oWCTV1aaa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se to lose weight, the sole method that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials in stock, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 25 pounds, it definitely does work!|`|aqY13vWNaa	nope.|`|45ab0bea68cbc724ceec9b426a6147b3aa	Never heard of it. Can you give any information about it or where we can find it.
1TrWuMOraa	You could be getting pregnant maybe the egg is implanting on the uterus.|`|iTyLs2S6aa	You said it doesn't happen every time?  Does it happen sometimes?  Maybe your period is coming.  But I don't know so|`|TIqFAXo1aa	Possibly PID- pelvic inflammatory disease if you have even a bacterial infection (or a STD)  that goes untreated ( even with no symptoms) it can turn ti PID-  you will have severe cramping pain when anything touches your cervix.  It is miserable!     need to see a Dr.- get some antibiotics!
93909d2e52303686a9d28ba9c4223210aa	It's called pre-menstrual syndrome.  (the period before your period)|`|X05Jiim4aa	It could be that you are ovulating.  I generally will have menstrual like cramps about the time I'd be ovulating.|`|b81734196ba16857e0c83588ad4a6dd5aa	I believe that is when you are ovulating.
KGf1hUzhaa	Yes you can get it from contact with infected blood, or bodily fluids.  (edit: The respondent below makes the comment that we need to be more aware that Hep C is not transmitted through saliva, and other secretions, he should be aware that Hep B can be acquired through those vary mechanisms.  There were several outbreaks of Hep B among wrestlers and sweat on the mats.  Also the CDC says that Hep C can be spread infrequently through sex with infected persons, so to say it is not spread through non-blood bodily fluids is not entirely accurate.)    Hep b will have about 5% of people who will develop a chronic infection potentially leading to a bad liver, the rest who are infected with hep b will clear it with no real long term consequences.  Almost all hep c infections will be chronic and also predispose someone to heptocellular carcinoma.      However, if someone already has a bad liver, they will be less likely to have a proper immune response to a hep infection in the liver.  The immune response they do have will cause more damage to an already bad liver that will not be able to heal itself.    The more correct answer is hepatitis gives you a bad liver.  Just because you have a bad liver does not mean you will get hepatitis.|`|AA10247648	You do not get Hepatitis from a bad liver. The Hepatitis causes liver problems.      Hepatitis B is a  serious infection. It may lead to a condition called cirrhosis (permanent scarring of the liver) or liver cancer, both of which cause severe illness and even death. Hepatitis B is transmitted from person to person through blood or other body fluids.  Like hepatitis B, hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. Also like hepatitis B, hepatitis C is transmitted from person to person through blood or other body fluids.|`|WadzK6ejaa	Hepatitis b and c are transmmited by blood products through contact of infected blood with healthy blood   and by sex|`|943a06379672bf66a6adfd4e61f757a4aa	I would suggest that all the respondents check for newer information as their information is outdated and superseded by at least 3 studies at reliable non-self serving universities instead of the NIH, or CDC, both of which rely on a very flawed study that eliminated veterans treated at the VA hospitals (>80% of Nam era vets have HCV), prisoners of State and Federal Corrections Dept. (> 75% infection rate), and the poor who did not have insurance forms to fill out so the information was deemed unreliable (strange that the CDC deems indigence as an at risk behavior, but won't count them in their studies totals). Hep C (HCV) is NOT in saliva, sweat, semen, or normal vaginal secretions!  Avoid blood and you won't get HCV!  Hepatitis is the diagnosis for liver damage. It can be caused by many things. Fatty liver, alcoholism, and many others. Hepatitis B & C are virus', they are caused by viral infection and destroy the liver over a period of time.  My bet is that one of you is thinking of the viral infection that causes liver damage, while the other has heard the term hepatitis applied in it's more generic meaning of diseased / damaged liver. It still would apply only to a bad liver. You can have hepatitis (which is a bad liver) without HBV or HCV, but you can't get HBV or HCV (Hep B & C) from hepatitis.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Any form of hepatitis is an infection that CAUSES liver damage.  Hep C is a virus that is transmitted primarily by infected blood, such as sharing needles for drug use with someone who is infected, use of contaminated tatoo needles, or sharing razors or toothbrushes with someone who is infected.  Hep C can also be transmitted through sex, but transmission this way is rare.      There is no cure for Hep C, but there is treatment.  However, as someone mentioned above, Hep C can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
li1IRTBEaa	It take 1 calorie (lower case calories) to raise 1 ml of water 1 degree celsius.<br>  So it takes (35C*236ml) 8000 calories to raise 8 ounces from just above freezing to body temperature. Dietary Calories (upper case calories) are actually kilocalories, so it burns about 8 Calories.|`|6e2eebd498466699a4ceb47740f7b7cfaa	It's true, but I wouldn't go guzzling ice water to lose a few ounces. Your body burns calories when you are sleeping, but your not going to lose weight by sleeping all day either.|`|7637526c7767e249545859632d287137aa	NO!|`|8f5415584506c28944b7813a7619da69aa	i thought it was hot water??|`|RNfOLS1taa	I read about this too.<br>  <br>  Apparently, drinking cold water DOES burn calories.  This is because your body tries to warm the water once its inside your body, and this warming process requires calories.<br>  <br>  It's not going to be a huge calorie burn though.. but I'm sure it burns a few.|`|STYevDX9aa	I've never heard that...  I could see an argument being that, in heating the water (or maintaining your body heat) your body has to burn more calories than if the water is already body temperature, but honestly we are probably talking fractions of calories if that.|`|oje0jXy0aa	I have heard that is true. And I am using a product that encourages cold shakes with their system. If you are trying to loose weight it is awesome!  I have lost 8 pounds my first week!  If you want to burn calories, I think you have a choice of exercise or this incredible system I am using! It is easy, safe(designed by a doctor) and guaranteed! Check it out!|`|26b58f090f3edfbdd055b095807c5833aa	It is true but the effect is so small it doesn't make any practical difference in weight loss.<br>  <br>  If you laid in a tub full of ice you'd also burn calories but that isn't realistically suggested, either.

And dont ever skip any meal... just eat little amount of food.
11Kk4t72aa	It could be a rush of adrenolin or it could be a harmone imbalance.  It could be just about anything.  If this keeps happening  check with your Dr,   Especially if you get hot and cold flashes, because it really could be a thyroid problem.  That happened with me.  And in that case you will need to see a Dr. and most likely be put on medication.  Just keep and eye on it for now... But don't let it go for too long if it keeps happening.
I17RgGcxaa	Well, herpes for example can be passed on through skin contact - so ejaculate is irrelevant there.<br>  It would be more risky to have the ejaculate in your mouth than to not, but it would be riskier still to swallow.<br>  It is even possible to contract an STD orally from pre-***, so even if you don't allow a man to ejaculate in your mouth there is still a risk.<br>  Always use condoms.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	okay first of all it has been proven that u can get std's through oral sex so if I was u I would go get checked out no telling what u have|`|AA12091376	Herpes and HPV (for instance) are transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, not bodily fluids.  And even if a guy doesn't fully orgasm, he may still ejaculate some from the stimulation.<br>  <br>  Oral sex can be just as risky as sex - having sex with someone doesn't mean that you will automatically get the STD the first time either.  While people use condoms while having sex, they often don't use any kind of protection when having oral sex - therefore, it can actually be even riskier.  It is all playing the odds, and you have to decide what kind of risk you are comfortable taking.|`|6Oo9xWNyaa	well its kinda the same thing. but i believe that actually having the n*t in your mouth gives it a higher risk. Try it out...see for yourself.|`|Jpt8y3yBaa	First I would like to say Amelia is an idiot because she don't know how to read. The answer to you first question is yes, the chances of getting that disease does increase because seminal fluid carries a huge load of viruses if they are infected, and can come in contact with an open soar or cut in the mouth or the back of the throat, especially if you let their penis hit the back of your throat. (Sorry for being technical). But you can also transmit an STD from premature ejaculation. But the likelihood of passing STD's are less through oral sex because some are not airborne diseases. Unless you don't breath when you do it, which means you a beast. lol<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!!

Close to a month later I had a second test done and it was positive.
AA11614478	I know how you feel, believe me. I contracted both genital herpes and HPV also, but at the age of 17. I have had them for over 6 years now. <br>  <br>  You'll probably think I'm crazy for saying this, but it gets better! Now that I have had both viruses for so long it's not even a big deal anymore. Time heals everything!<br>  <br>  Genital herpes affects 1 out of 4 women and about 1 in 5 men. So, you are certainly not alone; it's VERY common! MILLIONS of people have this virus! <br>  <br>  As for a normal life and sex life it's totally possible. I have been with my current fiance for 2 years and we have a great relationship and a great sex life (including oral sex). I was with my ex for almost 4 years and we had a great relationship too, and he never contracted the virus from me. You shouldn't limit yourself or be unhappy because of this. There are a lot of great guys out there who don't care if you have these viruses. They'll love you for you and look past what you have! <br>  <br>  I've personally had about 5 outbreaks the whole 6+ years I have had genital herpes. I had about 4 within the first two years. Right now I've been outbreak free for 2+ years. I take acyclovir when I get outbreaks. I've also tried Famvir which worked really well too. <br>  <br>  If you ever want to talk about it you can always email me! I know what you are going through. Don't worry, you might feel really bad now, but it is nothing to commit suicide over, trust me!|`|eRyVH2wMaa	well it could be alot worse like aids. You cant die from these diseases. Go get treated for them all because Chlymidia will make u steril. No more oral sex because u can still spread all of them even if u have no out breaks. If u have any more questions feel free to e-mail me at <br>  amelia_0405@yahoo.com|`|0b6a417126e4e095cb0ff211401dc89baa	I'm sorry that this happened to you.  When I was in college one of my close friends went through this.  She found a nice husband and has children.  When she first found out she was very upset, like you.  20% of adults in the US know they have this and many more have it but don't know.  Talk to your doctor to get medicine to prevent outbreaks.  You can have sex.  If your doctor is not helpful or sympathetic then find one who is.  This is not something to kill yourself over.  Call a suicide hot line.  Maybe they can refer you to a support group.  Do a web search for groups on the net.  Is it possible that your boyfriend didn't know?  Did you break up over this?  If so, maybe you can talk to him.|`|4677c76e0decf8fab182be1f9eaa3787aa	You are a great example of the worst part of having Herpes.  The psychological effects are the most difficult thing about having it.  The disease, in and of itself, may be a nuisance to some but not really that big of a deal.  Oral herpes is a bigger health concern and far more have that yet millions arent contemplating suicide over having a facial outbreak.  Can you have a normal life?  Well more people have HSV than do not so technically speaking, you are abnormal if you do not have it.  Can you have sex again?  Of course!  There is no reason for ostracization with having genital herpes.  Certainly no greater concern over kissing someone with oral HSV.  Infact, the majority aquire HSV from close family contact before adulthood.  <br>  <br>  Now as for the physical symptoms, most people do not experience any after the initial outbreak (if even then).  I do not suggest you to ask what others experience as will only serve to reinforce fears in your mind of the worst to expect.  You will likely experience 1-2 outbreaks per year if any at all.  The subsequent outbreaks will usually be milder in severity.   The frequency of recurrence (if any) will lessen over time.  If you find that managing the physical symptoms of herpes difficult, a doctor will give you a nucleoside analog.<br>  <br>  Who thumbed my answer down?  Please post so I can correct your judgement.|`|8de0d5e30b00f98cba11fa8a3fb06189aa	He should have told you he had the decease and he should have used condoms. Doctors say that the decease is most contagious when sores are present, but that doesn't mean that it is not contagious when there are no sores. Therefore you should always ask your partners to use condoms. If they really love you, they will appreciate the fact that you tell them of the risk of not using condoms. <br>  When you are ready to have children, you will be able to have them. If you have sores at the time of birth, your doctor will recommend a c-section to avoid contact of the baby with the virus.|`|VVtLrVaFaa	first of all im sorry that you got that horrible disease second i dont think you should have sex before marriage if you didnt none of this would have happened third i dont believe in oral sex why would you wan to lick someone where they piss out of? fourth there are a lot of medicines out there watch TV sometime they advertise it all the time and please dont kill yourself that would be a horrible waste of life im sure God has something amazing planned for you!|`|xUHoDmvIaa	Hello! I just recently found I have it too. I went to planned parenthood. They gave me the right medicines. They will educate you. You will still be able to have children, don;t worry.I have only had one breakout. I have it for about 9 months. But just recently got tested. I wasn't sure what it was. It is scary and I hate it. But I did it to myself. I think about it every time I go to the bathroom, go to bed at night, it never goes away. I cant stop thinking about it. I am going to join a support group in June. You should come too!!

That being said, you can still lose 16 pounds by the end of August. Losing weight is just a matter of burning more calories than you take in.  YOu can either eat less calories than your body is used to, or you can exercise and burn calories that way - or you can safely do both in moderation.  A very good website is freedieting.com - they have BMI charts and calorie intake charts to help you know how many calories you need each day based on your height, weight, age and level of activity.  No crash diets are necessary.  If you count your calories, you can eat whatever you like -until you reach your limit each day - so it takes some planning.

There is also sex between same-sex couples, males have something called buttsex in which the man's butt act as a vagina and sex between two women usually needs something called a strap on or a dildo now dildo are common among both gay men and gay women as well as straight sex with the dildo put in the womans vagina.|`|REuARSfmaa	Ok, to me it sounds like a yeast infection, but are you creamin' that might be it too.

MjKOBQQqaa	You said that your acne is mild. So most likely your scars aren't deep.    And that's good news.    To fade those scars will be easy. All you've got to do is exfoliate regularly.    Exfoliation is simply the removal of the top layer of skin (called the epidermis).    This layer can be removed by using Glycolic Acids and or Salicylic Acids (chemical peels). Or mechanically (microdermabrasion)    By regularly removing the epidermis...you'll also be removing the skin that is scarred by your acne.    To remove the scars quickly...    ...I recommend visiting a doctor and inquiring about a deep facial peel.    A deep peel removes the epidermis at a greater depth. And as a result your scars will disappear in no time.     But... I must warn you that deep peels are expensive.    You can also remove the scars with at-home facial peels. These products ususally contain alpha-hydroxy acids and/or beta hydroxy acids.     Or you can buy a facial scrub. This is a cream which contains tiny particles to scrub away the epidermis.    These at home versions are effective and less costly.     But...    ...they work slower than the doctor's versions. And you must use them at least 3 times a week if they are to be effective.    For more information about exfoliation and acne scars treatnment...    ...Check out the following website:    http://www.facialskincarefacts.org/Facia...|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Vitamin E  prevents acne or pimple scarring and can also be used  to fade old scars.

(2) you may need another pain killer, which because of your constant abuse may NOT work. (3) the challenge then is to find a drug or combination of drugs that will work....again which may not be possible. <br>  And we haven't even begun to discuss the DAMAGE done to your body by the initial abuse......In short drug abuse is NOT in your best interest, it causes so many problems and has NEVER solved any.|`|AEPMqIHIaa	Your body does develop a tolerance if you abuse painkillers and you really need them when you are sick..... if you continue to do so you will always need something stronger then the dr and nurse will label you as a drug seeker and you will no longer get the pain killers or a perscription just a one time in office or in the er injection of painkiller to last maybe 4-6 hrs|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Absolutely...it's very common.|`|lxHOkmlvaa	Only Narcotic painkillers develop a tolerance and an addiction.

So you cannot take more of them in the hopes that the pain will go.|`|nyrwGTqsaa	yes and not only that they can damage your liver!|`|zoybmDPraa	You can develop a tolerance to narcotic pain killers, requiring you take an increasing dose to reach the same affect.  However, the larger problem is that of addiction.  It is relatively easy to become addicted to these medications.  It is important that you only take them when you actually need them.  <br>  <br>  Remember, addiction and chemical dependence are diseases.  Don't worry about the pain killers working when you are actually sick.  If you are an addict, you are already sick.
iooR0uLgaa	Having a fast metabolism can make you hungry more of the time. What a fast metabolism means is that the processing and digesting which occurs in your gastro area, otherwise known as your stomach, digests and channels the food and substances which you eat, way faster than normally. It's not really a problem, but it usually keeps people more thin than usual, and at the same time might lead to you being more hungry. It really isn't a big deal, just eat three-5 times a day, but small meals rather than large ones and eat healthy, and you shall be fine. Good Luck, and Peace. Edit: The best thing to do is to eat right, and follow through with eating with healthy foods and getting rights amounts of that food daily that your body needs in order to get the daily amounts of vitamins and minerals you need. Check the Food Pyramid , and it really helps a lot to know what you need to do in order to have a successful diet and so forth. You are fine, nothing to worry about. Thanks.|`|54553eded5a0af11a3085e25189de76baa	Not necessarily.......It Means your digestive system is functioning well....but then again- what type of foods are you eating?  If you're eating white stuff and sugar, of course you will get hungry fastern and this is not good.  Must have protein, fats and slow digesting  carbs to keep blood sugar steady.|`|zybhcwzEaa	trust me ur jus fat.|`|X2qZN5Y2aa	If you have a fast metabolism it just means your body is processing food at a much faster rate.  If you want to slow down your metabolism there are a few things you can do.  Number 1, try eating bigger meals less time per day. This will force your body to work harder to digest food.  Secondly, focus on eating foods that take longer to digest and break down, rather than ones that are immediately consumed for energy or stored as fat. Simple sugars such as potatoes, rice, fruits and dairy are immediately entered into the bloodstream for glucose (sugar) conversion, while complex carbohydrates and proteins, such as oats, grains, beans, meat, brown rice and legumes take longer to digest.

I would do legs 1st so they could be rested for the bike.  The total gym is good for slimming & not bulking up.  Also stretch after the bike while you are warm.  A banana & 4 brazil nuts at bedtime work great to replenish the potassium your sore muscles burned up helping you sleep like a baby & restore your energy with selenium which we make less of as we get older.  Your friend has fallen into the trap set by all the media telling us how a person should look, don't you get caught in it too.  A twist on Whitney Houston's song should be "Everything you do, you do it for YOU!"  <br>  Best of luck to you.

It's a tad uncomfortable, but it doesn't hurt. They will use a speculum to do the pap smear, but you really won't feel it.

When you excersise your body releases oils and salts in your sweat as well as just water. So if you don't shower after excercising that sweat dries on your face and body causing breakouts or acne in some cases. Dieting might be the problem only if the diet change is dramatic. Allergies may also be to blame if you're eating new foods that you have never tried before. Anyways, just shower after excersising and read the ingredients of your foods and you should be fine. If not then I recommend talking with your dermatoligist.|`|JtDcmqDHaa	well you will break out if you lose it the wrong way. I once lost 30 pounds in 2 weeks, because of a gal stone. well i broke out like crazy. It cleared in a while after I got better, the doctor said because my body was detoxicating itself and my hormones went nuts. He told me to eat a bang of fruits, vegtables like broccoli. He also told me to avoid all fat and junkfood for a month and it helped. Wter daily, try drinking up tp 3 gallons a day and you will see a big difference. Sometimes acne can be cured starting from your stomach, so keep in mind that really eating those vegtables you will soon get an acne free face. If yo dont like veggies, atleast do it untill you clear but you wont see a difference untill you really try. good luck, i have been there too and it will get better. ^_^

m6rUxHVFaa	A BRIEF HISTORY OF AIDS<br>  <br>  In the early 80's, doctors started seeing more and more people with suppressed immune systems coming into emergency rooms with several opportunistic infections. These were primarily gay men and intravenous drug users. There was<br>  panic within the gay community and in the general population as more and more people began dying of what was called AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br>  <br>  In 1984, Robert Gallo, a research scientist working for the National Institute of Health (NIH), announced in a press conference that he had discovered the probable cause of AIDS, and that it was a retrovirus later called HIV: Human<br>  Immunodeficiency Virus. Without having published his findings for peer review he announced this to the press. The media immediately ran with it, and people began demanding funding into research into HIV, all based on the assumption that<br>  HIV is a sexually-transmitted pathogen that causes AIDS. <br>  <br>  The gay community especially rallied and pushed for more AIDS funding and better education about 'safe sex'. In 1987 a drug called AZT was approved by the FDA for the treatment<br>  of AIDS, and this began a multi-billion dollar industry.<br>  <br>  RETROVIRUSES DO NOT CAUSE DISEASE<br>  <br>  HIV is a normal retrovirus. Its genetic composition does not differ very much from other retroviruses. No retrovirus has ever been shown to cause disease outside of a lab. Unlike ordinary viruses, retroviruses do not kill their host cells. Retroviruses occur naturally inside of the cells of many animals, including humans. Retroviruses are seen by many scientists to be naturally occurring parts of our cells. Retroviruses are not sexually-transmitted, but they are passed from mother to child. Retroviruses had been studied by the NIH extensively throughout the 70's in hopes that they would find a retrovirus that caused cancer. Because retroviruses do not kill cells, they were a perfect candidate for cancer, in which cells do not die but instead multiply rapidly.<br>  <br>  Millions of dollars went into all of this research into retroviruses with nothing to show for it. Gallo himself tried to prove more than once that he had found a disease-causing retrovirus, only to be debunked by the scientific community. When AIDS appeared, Gallo and the NIH were already looking for a<br>  disease that they could blame on a retrovirus, to justify all of their wasted funding.<br>  <br>  HIV HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND<br>  <br>  HIV has never been isolated from human blood. What AIDS researchers call isolation of HIV is the finding of certain chemicals and enzymatic activity that they claim indicates the presence of HIV. They find proteins and genetic material thought to come from HIV, or they find reverse transcriptase activity.<br>  <br>  But none of these proteins, RNA strands, or enzyme activities are unique to HIV.<br>  <br>  What most AIDS scientists research in their labs is a lab artifact. It is HIV that is created and grown in a lab, and it is thought to be the same thing that causes AIDS when it infects people.<br>  <br>  THE TEST DOES NOT FIND HIV<br>  <br>  The test for HIV does not look for an actual virus in your blood. It looks for antibodies that will react with a set of proteins that are produced by HIV. But none of these proteins are specific to HIV. Antibodies in the blood resulting<br>  from other conditions can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test. Blood must be diluted before being tested for HIV. Without dilution, all blood samples would test positive for HIV because we all have some antibodies that will cross-react with the test. There are at least 66 factors that are known to<br>  cause false positive results on an HIV test, including other infections, drug use, and receptive anal sex. Having unprotected receptive anal sex causes your body to produce antibodies in response to semen. <br>  <br>  These antibodies to semen can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test, producing a false positive result. In addition, people of African descent have a higher probability of<br>  testing false positive, because they naturally have a greater variety of antibodies in their blood.<br>  <br>  NO GOLD STANDARD FOR HIV TESTING<br>  <br>  HIV tests are not standardized. This is because HIV has never been isolated from human blood, so there is no way to know how specific the tests are to HIV infection. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve a single HIV<br>  test for the diagnosis of HIV infection. There are a variety of tests, and the results are interpreted differently in different countries. So the same sample of blood could test positive in the United States while testing negative in Europe. Another more expensive HIV test is the viral load test. Viral load<br>  testing makes use of PCR: polymerase chain reaction. It takes a very small amount of genetic material and makes enough copies of it that you can detect it.<br>  <br>  Dr. Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel prize for inventing PCR, is among the scientists who say that HIV does not cause AIDS. He claims that viral load testing is a misuse of PCR. PCR does not find isolated virus in the blood. It finds pieces of RNA strands thought to belong to HIV.<br>  <br>  PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES MEANS IMMUNITY<br>  <br>  Usually, if you test positive for antibodies that means that your immune system has effectively fought off a pathogen and you now have immunity. But with the HIV test, the logic is reversed. Instead of meaning that you now have immunity to HIV, testing positive is said to mean that you are infected and your immune<br>  system has failed to neutralize the virus. The great hope for many who believe that HIV causes AIDS is that researchers will some day develop a vaccine. But vaccines work by causing your body to produce antibodies specific to a pathogen.<br>  If a vaccine for HIV was created, everyone who had the vaccine would then test positive for HIV on the non-specific antibody tests now in use.<br>  <br>  AZT SUPPRESSES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>  <br>  The original drug used to treat people with AIDS, called AZT, was not created for AIDS treatment. AZT was originally developed in the 70's as a chemotherapy drug for cancer patients, but it was not approved because it was determined to<br>  be too toxic. Chemotherapy for cancer patients is limited to a certain duration, while AZT and similar drugs are prescribed to AIDS patients for the rest of their lives. The study that lead to FDA approval for AZT has now been shown to have been fraudulent. The package for AZT says: "TOXIC. Toxic by<br>  inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Wear suitable protective clothing." Among other side effects, AZT destroys the bone marrow of the body.<br>  <br>  The reason doctors see an initial rise in their patients' T cell count after taking AZT is because the bone marrow is where T cells are produced. AZT destroys the bone marrow and this releases more T cells from the marrow into the blood. Prolonged use of AZT has been shown to suppress the immune system and lower T cell counts. About 95% of AIDS-related deaths have occurred since the release of AZT.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRAL SIDE EFFECT LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH<br>  <br>  The newer protease inhibitors used in combo therapy are also a type of chemotherapy. They work by preventing the replication of genetic material belonging to HIV. But these proteins are not specific to HIV, and the protease<br>  inhibitors do not exclusively target HIV. The highest cause of death today for people with AIDS is liver failure. Liver failure is not an AIDS-defining illness, but it is a known side-effect of the protease inhibitors. AIDS patients can see the disappearance of some symptoms while taking the drug cocktails. This is because the drugs they are taking are global poisons that<br>  kill many microbes in the body that may be pathogenic, such as bacteria and other viruses.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRALS NOT PROVEN TO IMPROVE HEALTH<br>  <br>  The drug companies claim that the release of protease inhibitors in 1996 was responsible for decreased deaths due to AIDS. But deaths from AIDS had already begun a declining trend three years before in 1993, and the introduction of<br>  protease inhibitors did not significantly alter this trend. Studies are no longer comparing AIDS drugs with a placebo. Now when they test a new antiretroviral drug they compare a group taking the new drug with a group that is taking the older drugs. There are no studies being done comparing the difference in health between people taking the AIDS medications and people who are not taking the drugs, though many HIV positive people lead healthy lives free of disease for many years, without taking AIDS medication.<br>  <br>  CDC REDEFINES AIDS TO INCREASE NUMBERS<br>  <br>  AIDS statistics can be very misleading. This is because of the many definitions for AIDS that have been used by different countries and at different times.<br>  <br>  Originally, in the United States you had to test HIV positive and have one or more of the AIDS-defining illnesses to be counted as somebody with AIDS. In 1993 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) expanded this definition to include<br>  anyone who tested positive for HIV and had a T cell count of under 200. This nearly tripled the perceived number of AIDS cases in the US. Many of the people who have AIDS by this definition are perfectly healthy, and would not be<br>  considered to have AIDS if they moved to Canada.<br>  <br>  AIDS IN AFRICA CAUSED BY POVERTY<br>  <br>  Today we are told that ridiculously large numbers of people in Africa are HIV positive and will die of AIDS unless treated. These statistics are not counts of people who have actually tested positive. It is an estimation generated from<br>  a sample population. The sample population is primarily pregnant women, who are the ones who get priority for medical treatment in poor countries. But pregnancy is known to be a source for false positive results on HIV tests. And<br>  people of African descent in general are more likely to test false positive.<br>  <br>  The World Health Organization does not require a positive HIV test for the diagnosis of AIDS in Africa. All that is required is a certain number of symptoms. But all of these symptoms can also be explained by malnutrition, malaria, and tuberculosis, conditions that have been health risks for Africans<br>  long before the invention of AIDS. The health of poor Africans would undoubtedly be improved with better food and sanitation. <br>  <br>  But funding is now being geared towards delivery of toxic AIDS medications to Africans rather than for these basic essentials.<br>  <br>  AIDS DEFINES ITSELF<br>  <br>  Clearly many people have died in this country and elsewhere as the result of a suppressed immune system. But the 29 AIDS-defining illnesses are not new illnesses, and they all have previously documented causes and treatments.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis of AIDS now works like a formula. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV negative, you are told you have pneumonia. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV positive, you are told you have AIDS and you are treated with toxic<br>  AIDS drugs. For those people who are truly immune suppressed, there are other possible explanations for this phenomenon, and many safe non-toxic therapies.<br>  <br>  DRUGS AND MALNUTRITION CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  If the true condition of AIDS is a suppressed immune system unable to fight off opportunistic infections, there are many other factors that can cause this.<br>  <br>  Drugs such as cocaine and crystal methane are known to suppress the immune system. These drugs were used extensively by many gay men in the 1970's and 1980's. Intravenous drug users who have AIDS are said to be immune suppressed due to HIV, rather than due to the drug they have been injecting.<br>  <br>  Corticosteroids and some antibiotics, often prescribed to drug addicts and promiscuous gay men, are also immune suppressive. Blood given to hemophiliacs and other transplant recipients used to be treated with immune suppressing<br>  agents. Now with a new way to treat this blood, AIDS among blood recipients has declined. Despite predictions of a global epidemic, AIDS cases in the United States have remained confined to its original primary risk groups: promiscuous<br>  gay men and intravenous drug users. In the gay party scene, drug use, malnutrition, and sleep deprivation continue to be high risk factors for immune deficiency.<br>  <br>  POPPERS CAUSE KAPOSI'S SARCOMA<br>  <br>  Kaposi's Sarcoma is one of the AIDS-indicator diseases, but it primarily occurs in gay men and not other AIDS groups. Nitrite inhalants or poppers, used extensively by gay men in the 70's and 80's, have been shown to cause Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS). KS is a cancer of the blood vessels. Nitrites are known<br>  carcinogens. KS is usually seen in gay men around the face, mouth, and in the lungs, all sites of contact with nitrite fumes.<br>  <br>  There are many recorded incidents of KS in HIV-negative gay men who used poppers. As the use of poppers decreased in the 90's, the incidence of KS also decreased. Poppers are still<br>  used by many gay men.<br>  <br>  FEAR ALONE CAN CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  Fear and anxiety is another factor that can suppress the immune system. Stress releases cortisol in the body. This cortisol is used to help break down tissues for the release of energy needed in a fight or flight situation. But prolonged<br>  stress and anxiety creates abnormally high levels of cortisol in the body.<br>  <br>  Cortisol has been shown to suppress the immune system and decrease T cell counts. Irregular sleep or lack of sleep also increases cortisol levels. Gay men who face discrimination and hatred for their sexuality can experience chronic fear and anxiety. Intravenous drug users also face a lot of chronic<br>  fear and paranoia as part of their addiction. Testing positive for HIV itself can create huge amounts of fear in the person being diagnosed.<br>  <br>  GREAT VIDEO<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com.au/videoplay?docid=3983706668483511310&q=deconstructing+the+my" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com.au/videoplay?doc...</a>|`|ZPaNojjvaa	yeah  More answer for your question will be available in this website <a href="http://www.aidsthekillerdisease.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aidsthekillerdisease.com</a>|`|49162eecae8e9d33265ef4f07a44af10aa	here are some links...they say the men travel long distances to find work and are away from their families for long periods of time, so they seek out sex workers and the women and sometimes young girls are impoverished and sometimes become sex workers in order to survive (eat).Then the men take the disease home to their wives. ...look at the CCISD website and that is where that information came from...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/countries/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/countri...</a> (programs by country list)<br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/program_areas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/program...</a> (CDC global strategies)<br>  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/default...</a> (global HIV AIDS links)<br>  <a href="http://www.ccisd.org/ang/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccisd.org/ang/index.htm</a> (AIDS in Africa)|`|eRyVH2wMaa	go to              aids history<br>                          aids origin<br>                         how long aids has been in africa

Yoga on the otherhand is all about balance and flexibility. It is much more relaxing.      Pilates will help you lose more calories, so it's definitely a better work out then yoga.
EN32vSsCaa	She has to WANT to stop smoking pot.  If she doesn't, there really is nothing the you can do for her.  When she does decide to quit, support her.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	That's ridiculous have you ever stopped to think that they are not related? Smoking pot doesn't make you fail school and dye your hair. Depression may make you fail school, depression may make you dye your hair if you're doing it in a self destructive manner, and depression could make you want to smoke a lot of pot.    I know a LOT of people who smoke pot and are very very smart people with good jobs, families, take care of themselves and are very successful. That said I know a lot who are also burnouts. It's all about who YOU are.|`|TKsYoM26aa	well this question is kinda wierd cause you can never fully change someone. if she likes pot then she likes pot. but what i would do is sit her down and say stuff like "so what do you want to do with your life" and "hows school going" but ask them in a way that is relaxed and as if your not even gonna bring pot up. just general questions. then eventually segue these questions into what you want to talk about. space out your arguments. dont hit something to heavy because you will just look like a buzz kill. be very relaxed when you talk to her about it. if she gets pissed then she looks like a b!tch because you are just chillin     i wouldnt take a sharp opposition to pot itself. i mean usually excessive drug or substance abuse is a sign that things aren't alright. maybe shes having a hard time at home. maybe no body pays attention to her. maybe that boy she likes smokes and she wants to impress him. so instead of attacking weed find the source.     you dont have to ask her to stop completely but slowing down would really make you happy. (then later if she starts doing it too much then you say something like maybe you should stop completely cause you are prone to relapse). remind her whats important. if you two are such good friends a) she shouldn't be cussing you out. b) she should respect your opinion and listen to what you have to say. show her you care    idk this is a bunch of stuff. kinda unorganized srry for that haha.    but finally, my last piece of advice: Be very patient. some people cant just hit it and quit it. they get hooked. so be prepared for this stuff to completely fail for a while. then she doesnt need that 3rd bowl. then she doesnt need that 2nd bowl. then she skips a hit. but in the end if this fails and the advice of whoever else answers this question fails then you should understand that she probably isnt coming back the same person that you grew up with.    P.S. im a stoner too and sometimes i wish that someone cared enough to do this for me.|`|ikERqdReaa	don't make her quit, no one likes someone who pokes at them to quit smoking pot.  suggest she doesn't smoke it at SCHOOL. if she still cusses you out, stop trying and let her find out the hard way.|`|zidiYWU1aa	Unfortunately you cant help some one who doesnt want to be helped. write her a letter explaining how much you care about her and look up some facts about marijuana and its health concerns.. attach it to the letter and make sure she understands that you care about her and her health.|`|r59SRbKIaa	You don't.    At your age, everyone "knows everything." You don't like to be told and hear everything anyone tells you as "bla bla bla LECTURE."     You're doing it right now, with my words, AREN'T YOU?    I've had two daughters go through my house, and this is an undeniable fact. The only thing you can do is reflect how much you care for her and if she ever needs you, you are here.    Anything you do or say will only serve to push her farther away until she totally hates you. So you need to stop trying to "play parent" and express one thing, and one thing only: that you care about her and no matter what she does you will still love her. And close your mouth to anything after that.|`|jovgDYBWaa	everyone here is pretty much right, I mean all u can do is just support her into quitting.       ~~420 + BlAz3~~    ^_^|`|h0dov8E0aa	Pot is not her problem so stop looking at that aspect of it  i think that she has a different problem but you are not mature enough to see it feel me.|`|hUTkuOYmaa	Tell her you'll be there to support her if she decides to quit. Then back off a bit, because you'll only lose her as a friend if you keep nagging and pestering.  It sounds like her problem is not pot, it's whatever is causing her to fail school and smoke pot. Look past these issues to find out what the real problem is.|`|KOH5kPuLaa	the pot isn't the problem it is the people she hangs with the pot doesn't hang with you while your not at school     she needs to make responsible decisions passing high school is a real need in our nation they wont even hire you at fast food if you don't have a diploma     if she wont listen to any thing she will learn soon after she gets out in real life most jobs drug test so she will only be able to get part time jobs at minimum wage and it only takes a few months in the real world to tell that minimum wage doesn't pay the bills.    GOOD LUCK|`|cjKPEHaFaa	It's her life, she is under no obligation to do what you want.  If she enjoys smoking pot, she's going to do it. And if you act like a priss about it, she won't want to be your friend anymore.      EDIT:  I just have to say that (9) is right on!  I have a Masters degree and was on the Dean's List all through college (a good school, I might add!) and I smoked pot every single day.  Pot does not make you do poorly in school, nor does it make you dye your hair.  It is a means to relax.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	I used to do that stuff when I was younger and got really into it.  My friend got mad at me about it and finally just told me that she cares about me and that I was starting to act really dumb and laugh all the time about stupid stuff.  I was also at a place in my life where I knew she was right so I stopped but if I wouldn't have agreed with her and been in that time in my life it might not have worked out that way.  I would just tell her you care about her and that maybe she should cut back or something.  The school thing isn't good, but I dig bright green hair.  Whynot?|`|kDoCgzOraa	pot rules!

If you do any small irritant on your bed/pillow can cause skin rashes which could take on the form of anything,look like bite marks,hives,or even just reddened area,etc.regardless if you go see a doc or not i would strip down the bed and put new sheets,vacuum the matress before putting the new ones on.Could be dust mites ,animal dander if you let dogs or cats sleep on your bed,could be any number of things.<br>  <br>  Cover all your bases,take care of the bed then go see a doc to in case the marks are unrelated.if its not going away there might be something right on your pillow causing the irritation and sleeping on it each night keeps it irritatedand keeps it from healing.If its eczema (a skin rash brought on by an allergy) then it can take awhile to fade away,doesn't usually go away overnight.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	go get it checked out just to be on the safe side okay|`|4d86c3ed115c5b24550bac5761530374aa	BITE MARKS?!

AA11415778	Please don't freak out and try a million different products and techniques on your face that everyone is suggesting. Not only will the emotional stress affect your skin, but mixing too many harsh products will aggravate the break outs.<br>  <br>  Start by trying a few quick tips that will reduce break outs. Always wash make up and impurities off each night. Pull your hair up and away from your face overnight and wash your pillow cases on a regular basis. This will prevent oils seeping into your pores.<br>  <br>  Next find both a face wash for sensitive skin that works well for you. If you don't have one already, products I love are Olay gentle foaming face wash for sensitive skin and Aveeno Ultra-Calming foaming cleanser, both of which you should be able to find at WalMart or a local drug store. Or, if you can spend a little bit more money, Clinique has great face washes as well.<br>  <br>  Next, keep in mind that over-washing your face can worsen your condition, not improve it. Only use a face wash at night to wash away make up and dirt. In the mornings, just rinse your face with warm water. <br>  <br>  Now we can talk about acne-treating products. I also have sensitive skin and struggled with break outs a few years ago. Stay AWAY from acid-based products, these will irritate the skin! One product I've found that I absolutely love and stand by is Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10. It's main ingredient is 10% benzoyl peroxide. (ProActiv uses 2% benzoyl peroxide.) You can find this for UNDER $10 Walmart or a drug store. <br>  <br>  Ok, now try this routine:<br>  <br>  1. Wash your hands. <br>  2. Use a mild face wash for sensitive skin to wash your face. <br>  3. Dry your face.<br>  4. Take a wash cloth and run it under hot water and compress your face. This is helping zits come to a head. Do it for about 10 minutes. <br>  5. Use 2 q-tips to gently squeeze zits that have come to a head (a white tip is showing). DON'T use your fingernails. As soon as it pops and blood produces, LEAVE IT ALONE.<br>  6. Repeat hot compresses for another 5-10 minutes.<br>  7. Apply one coat of Persa-Gel to entire face (avoid eye area)<br>  <br>  Now, here's a tip that has become a MIRACLE for me. <br>  <br>  Take an uncoated aspirin or tylenol (doesn't matter the brand as long as it has acetaminophen in it.) Make sure they're uncoated tablets. (No capsules) Crush up the tablet and use a wet q-tip to make a paste and apply it to active break outs on your face. You can put as much as you'd like on these spots. Leave it on overnight. It will greatly reduce swelling and redness. <br>  <br>  Now, for the morning:<br>  <br>  When you wake up, don't wash your face again. Use warm water to wash off the aspirin and Persa-Gel. Dry your face and apply a frangrance-free moisturizer or facial lotion for sensitive skin. (I love Clinique products but something you can find at WalMart is Olay moisture therapy lotion for sensitive skin)<br>  <br>  Allow the lotion to dry and then apply your make up. One great way to not only treat but HIDE break outs is a product I can't live with out: it's a liquid concealer that called Advantage (made by Clean & Clear). Make sure you pick a color that matches your skin tone. This product has hidden SO many zits for me.<br>  <br>  Please try this routine and see how it works for you.<br>  I'll even make a shopping list for you:<br>  <br>  1 bottle uncoated aspirin tablets<br>  Clean & Clear Persa-Gel 10<br>  Clean & Clear Advantage concealer stick<br>  Face wash for sensitive skin<br>  Moisturizer (frangrance-free & for sensitive skin)<br>  Q-tips<br>  <br>  Remember - stress will only worsen break outs. So keep in mind that no matter if you have a few zits, you're going to look absolutely gorgeous with your hair and dress and make up. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|0ccb636030ac416b462c65d5553b75e7aa	You can try Proactive.

Estudias, trabajas? Porque parece que todo tu mundo gira alrededor de él y eso no es bueno para nadie. Trata de verte mejor, ocupate de tu arreglo personal, salí vos a la calle a matar, fijate si a vos también te miran los hombres, empezá a mirar vos a los hombres en la calle. No importa si estás con él, con mirar no se traiciona a nadie. Cuando empieces a valorarte más vas a ver como todas tus inseguridades se van borrando, y los celos pasan a segundo plano.<br>  Tal vez necesites hacer terapia, porque lo que te pasa con él, no es culpa de él, está en tu mente, estás obsesionada.<br>  Fijate si este no es más que un rasgo particular de tu carácter. Tenés que hacerte esta pregunta: Cuando no estaba con él, que pensamiento reiterativo tenía? ?Con qué te torturabas cuando no estabas de novia?<br>  Porque las obsesiones se trasladan, no importa el motivo, hoy es por una cosa y ma?ana por otra, pero no te dejan tener la mente en paz, nunca hay silencio en tu interior.|`|67f111a3124f45f5aa85f4dcc91419b9aa	Hola ni?a, bueno primero te diré lo que observo, tu autoestima esta muy mal, es decir denotas que no te quieres y menos que ese chico te meresca porque por lo que dices lo encuadramos a que preferirías verlo con unas chicas muy wapas así como las describes cuerponas eso quiere decir que tu no te consideras wapa o linda, bueno mi consejo es que veas a un psicólogo, si tu pareja te quiere te entenderá y te apoyara<br>  ánimo|`|7SmPvTKUaa	eso se llama CELOS,tranquila!yo sufrí lo mismo con mi ex,y él me cortó por otra chava,pero inventó q por ser celosa...lo acepto soy hasta + celosa q tu!pero creo q ahora q estoy solterita,sé como solucionarlo:<br>  primero q nada,dices q llevan 4 a?os,yo duré con mi ex 1 mes,y obvio como olo tuyo ya es +,no crees q si no te quisiera ya te habría cortado desde hace 1000 a?os(bueno,no tanto porq solo llevan 4).Luego,yo lo q digo es q si no es muy enojón,hables con el sobre lo q te sucede,sino pidele un consejo a alguien + grande q tu(porq yo tengo 13 a?os),segurito y esa persona ya pasó por esto y sabe mejor lo q hay q hacer.Y ya despues talvez notes la diferencia,pero ojo,no cometas el error q yo,cuando le demostré mis celos a + no poder.<br>  Y en lo de q te has pensado matar,NO!digo...hay muchas + soluciones q esto OK!así q sacate lo otro de la mente.Bye! y SUERTE!!!!!|`|HThuSrryaa	Hola.<br>  Las emociones que sentimos no son del presente, ya lo hemos sentido cuando eramos peque?as, eso es importante reconocerlo, para saber el porque de nuestro comportamiento presente.

Tu ve lo bueno y preguntale a tu novio que le gusta de ti y grabatelo, veelo y sabras que eres hermosa y de seguro eres muy inteligente, sensible y simpatica, tu novio te quiere, si quieres saber por que lo digo, es por lo de mi amiga, el la aguanto mucho y le aguanto sus celos y enojos, tu novio hace lo mismo, lo cual quiere decir que te adora.<br>  Cuidate y date cuenta de lo especial y genial que eres, tines cosas maravillosas, mas de las que puedas imaginar, solo necesitas darte cuenta.|`|3idzqG8waa	Eso se le llama inseguridad, pero tranquila no es un problema grave; lo que puedes hacer para solucionar ello es que, cada ves que veas a tu novio y que pienses que el mira a otra chica, haste a la idea que no es cierto(que lo mas probable es que asi sea) cual sea el caso, concientete un poco mas ni?a y quierete mucho, ya que si la situacion sigue asi realmente se complicarar; pero bueno, haz actividades con tu novio y observa el amor que te expresa, con eso es suficiente y el tiempo se encargara de ayuidarte|`|727db5cc02adea315e73de83ce07b3b1aa	Hola:<br>  l averdad es que me recuerdas bastante a mi, por lo de mis inseguridades.<br>  Tambien soy bastante creativa como tu, pero estancada. Mi consejo, y espero que reflexiones bien, es el siguiente.<br>  Nunca dejes de ser tu misma.<br>  Nunca dejes que nadie te cambie pq recuerda que eres unica.<br>  Si a tu novio le molesta que seas celosa, que aprenda a vivir con ello, siempre y cuando tu aprendas que si os quereis lo suficiente, podra mirar a cuantas mujeres quiera, para eso la naturaleza nos dio ojos. Eso si, una cosa es mirar, otra muy distinta lanzarse al cuello.<br>  No te culpes por ello, cada uno es como es, pero no debes desear tu propia muerte porque tu pienses que tu pareja te dejara.....Si esto ocurriera alguna vez, no te derrumbres, seguramente no sabria apreciar lo que tenia. Por lo que comentas que te pasa desde hace 2 a?os, pienso que es la etapa en la que os consolidais mutuamente, y temes que ahora que va bien la cosa, se vaya al traste......crees que vale la pena por unas simples miradas??

So you would find a blood pressure medicine, for instance, as well as its generic (same drug under the chemical name rather than the brand name).  Norvasc, for instance, is amlodipine.

KLyYM1Laaa	Bello, é una vita che vedo polipi e papillomi quotidianamente al microscopio ma non avevo mai pensato a questa immagine un po' da corteo sessantottino....si tratta in entrambi i casi di neoplasie benigne epiteliali presenti un po' dappertutto, soprattutto nel tratto digerente, vie urinarie, vie respiratorie. Il papilloma ha dei sottili assi di connettivo, ben separati uno dall'altro, rivestiti da epitelio, e puó in effetti ricordare una mano aperta; il polipo - termine molto piú generico - é piú che altro un aggregato irregolare di ghiandole tra le quali non riconosci dei veri assi di connettivo, ma ricorda che il termine "polipo" si usa spesso a sproposito per indicare qualunque escrescenza nodulare. Ce ne sono comunque molte varianti, dipende dall'epitelio di insorgenza, ad es. nell'intestino ci sono gli "adenomi tubulo-villosi" che sono una perfetta sintesi di entrambi.<br>  Sul web-immagini trovi tutto, ma non cercare "polipi" perché ti mostra quelli da fare in insalata, cerca "papilloma" e "adenoma" e avrai giá un'idea.<br>  Se mi vieni a trovare te li faccio vedere al microscopio.|`|j4yyC4B2aa	prova quì<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ok.corriere.it/dizionario/alfabetico/a.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://ok.corriere.it/dizionario/alfabet...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.health.yahoo.net/c_hp_enc.asp?s=5" rel="nofollow">http://it.health.yahoo.net/c_hp_enc.asp?...</a>

9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	That's perfectly normal. I used to work in an office answering the telephone all day and I swear I could hear that phone ringing at night! This is just your memory of these familiar sounds, playing tricks on you. At your age, you probably spend most of your time texting and I'm sure your friends are yelling your name all day.

You may not be the only one within earshot that has a cell phone.|`|5Bu6kAjfaa	I hear people call my name all the time, too.  I used to think I was going crazy!  Often when I think I hear my name it is because someone says something similar to my name, but not my name (like I hear "Yes" as "Jess" all the time).    You may also hear noises because you have a memory associated with a place so your brain is assigning the memory of the noise to the place.  Maybe last time you were in the restroom your phone rang and now you are subconsciously remembering it.  (I get memory food cravings, like I ate waffles the first time I watched a movie and now every time I see that movie I want waffles).  It's just your brain's way of trying to make sense of the world.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	you either have excellent hearing, or you are being possessed.

If you constantly worry about it and overanalyze yourself, you can actually cause the problem you're worrying about.  So relax.

You have to burn calories through walking or running or something.|`|HlreKsEBaa	you dont. run/jog/walk 2 miles and that burns 150 calories. either that or puke b/c you wont have enough energy to burn 150 calories w/ out running, swimming, biking, something that is cardio involved. like explosive lunges, or jumping jax!|`|ICcmwXb7aa	crunches just strengthen your abs cardio works better|`|fowvUWY8aa	There are so many different versions of crunches and undoubtedly it varies from person to person, so it's pretty hard to say how many crunches it would take to burn 150 calories. Doing cardio exercise allows for a more accurate prediction of calories burned. I'd say do about 30 min of cardio per day and check out a table of common exercises and weights to determine how many calories you're burning. Also, remember by doing the crunches you'll be gaining muscle which metabolizes more energy (calories) than does fat. Good luck!

The more time you have to spend with your mouth open and the dentist working on teeth, the more likely you are to have some swelling. I had all four of mine taken out on a Friday and was back to work on Monday. The older you are the harder this type of procedure is on you. Young people tend to bounce back from things faster. Follow the instructions the dentist gives you. No major exercise, take it easy. Stay cool, soft foods, no soda pop, try not to smoke, ice on 20 minutes then off 20 minutes. Take your pain meds the first 2-3 days whether you think you need them or not. Once you let the pain become a problem, it is a lot harder to get control of.

977f378aeb73c5eaa59366e20ef0d37caa	Ice, Ice and more ice!!!    Slight swelling, bruising, and tenderness around a cut, bite, scrape, or puncture wound is normal. Swelling or bruising that develops slowly over 6 to 12 hours usually means a minor injury. If your symptoms improve with home treatment, do not involve a joint, and are not caused by infection, you probably do not need to have the injury checked by your doctor.    Injury to the skin may also break small blood vessels under the skin and cause more swelling and bruising than you would expect. Rapid swelling or bruising that begins immediately after a skin injury often means there is a large amount of bleeding or that damage to deeper tissues is present. You may need to have a skin injury checked by your doctor if a lot of swelling or bruising occurred within 30 minutes of the injury.    I hope you feel better...    (that was from a doctors advice and facts)|`|AA10647819	You could actually have a broken leg; people break bones all the time and walk around on them; you may have a fracture that's causing the swelling, or broken blood vessels that aren't healing, causing the swelling and bruising.    I'm not a doctor, but if it's been 3 weeks, it's not unusual to still have a bruise, if it was a severe injury.  BUT, that said, I'd suggest icing it off and on, 20 minutes ice, 20  minutes no ice. It won't stop the coloring, but it may help the swelling.    And call your doctor. Falling off a horse into a fence sounds kind of painful & you probably should see the doctor, just to be safe. Would you rather not heal correctly and risk being able to ride (or walk) in the future?    Best wishes.|`|e8af4a389087dfe559fec425f57e5c92aa	Make sure you ice and stretch your quad a lot.  Dont massage it because compressed thigh tissue already has the potential to be dangerous, and you dont want to make it worse then it already is.  In extreme cases, a serious quad contusion (or bruise) causes the formation of another bone in  the bloodied and bruises tissue.  After the bone solidifies it must be surgically removed.  Not trying to scare hear, but if it still is really painful in about a week, its worth having a doctor check it.|`|3cv920o1aa	Ice and ib prophrine will take the swelling down...big bruises take awhile and change colors as they go away i wouldnt woorry unless it feels like a bone is damaged..Your avator looks jus like mine..you must be my twin..       :)|`|QmIK2vgqaa	Drink some whiskey, get a sharp knife and cut a small slit in it to let out the spider eggs.

If you feel that it is the bruising that is the problem, there is one product that I would recommend. It is distilled witch hazel. It is the best product I have ever found for reducing bruising and swelling. A number of years ago I slipped and fell onto a metal barrel (I was working in a restaurant at the time and was fetching something from behind the bar. The floor was wet and slippery) My hip and thigh hit the edge/rim of the barrel and I crashed down with such force that I was in agony. I had extensive bruising and swelling of the hip and thigh. The pharmacist suggested witch hazel to me. I soaked cotton wool in the witch hazel and put it on the bruising for about 20 minutes twice a day. The bruising and swelling disappeared after 3-4 days.     I have used witch hazel ever since for cuts, bruises etc. I used it if my dog had a wound and I also use it if my 5 year old falls and gets cuts and bruises. In fact, it's the first thing she asks me for. (It used to be that she wanted me to kiss it better but she's a "big" girl now so she says that witch hazel works better :) )|`|LMpLbtHVaa	here's a home remedy http://tinyurl.com/2g9mqh|`|qZPZ2bTpaa	Put ice on it to make the swelling go down and numb the pain.

Three weeks is a long time for a bruise to hurt that badly. In the future if you hurt yourself apply pressure to the area for at least a minute after it happens. Then apply ice for 15 mins.

Also keep it elevated, if possible.|`|0MnTXjn8aa	I Would go to the Dr's. also when it starts to heal rub on vitamin E lotion.|`|1c674c32f70abbba9b74d0e568421553aa	GO TO DOCTOR    a small break or bad vein bruise could KILL you. especially in that area.

FWHoFtzraa	It depends just how low calorie.<br>  Your resting metabolic rate or RMR is the rate at which you burn calories from just staying alive, if you didn't do any exercise at all, is usually between 1400-1800 and depends on your lean muscle mass.<br>  If you eat below this amount, you will certainly lose muscle in addition to fat as the body will have to find energy very quickly to make up the deficit, as this is essentially starving, and muslce is easier to get energy from than fat.<br>  <br>  If you make sure you have lots of protein and do strengthening exercises, you will reduce the amount of muscle your body burns. It takes about 7000 kcal deficit to lose one kg of fat.<br>  So make sure that you exercise, and simply eat less than the total you burn off in exercise added to your RMR --just never less than your RMR.<br>  <br>  e.g. in one day:<br>  + 1800 calories food<br>  - 500 cals form 40 minute run<br>  - 100 cals from walking up and down stairs<br>  - 100 cals from walking to work<br>  - 1500 cals from RMR<br>  = total -400 calories <br>  7000/400 = ca. 18<br>  so you can expect to lose 1kg of fat within about 18 days.<br>  You will burn off the excess calories as fat during and after exercise, rather than as muscle because you don't have enough to live on.<br>  <br>  Bare in mind you will also lose water and other weight so your overall weightloss would be more than 1kg.|`|6de8798c6bf528620ad52ef6ce0d9893aa	If you want to preserve muscle and lose fat at the same time you want to use some patience, crash dieting will burn muscle.  Start by figuring your basal metabolic rate:<br>  <br>  STEP 1:<br>  Use this calculator:  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a><br>  <br>  STEP 2<br>  Harris Benedict Formula <br>  To determine your total daily calorie needs, multiply your bmr by the appropriate activity factor, as follows:<br>  If you are sedentary (little or no exercise) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.2 <br>  If you are lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.375 <br>  If you are moderatetely active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.55 <br>  If you are very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.725 <br>  If you are extra active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job or 2x training) : Calorie-Calculation = BMR x 1.9  <br>  <br>  I weigh 285lbs so the calculator says my BMR is 2576.45 and I am Moderately Active so this tells me I can eat 3999 calories/day and I will neither gain nor lose weight. <br>  <br>  If I want to LOSE weight at the rate of a pound a week (one pound = 3500 calories/7) I need to cut that daily intake by 500 calories, If I cut down to 2999 I should lose 2 lbs a week.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose fat but preserve muscle you don't want to be losing more than 3-4 pounds a week (except the first two weeks where you will loose a ton) so if you use the two equations above I wouldn't undercut that value by more than 1000 calories or else you will be burning muscle.<br>  <br>  Other things that will help spare muscle is keeping your protein intake level high, and continuing to hit the weights, also, every five or six days or so, allow yourself a free day where you put no restrictions on what you eat and you really amp up your calorie intake.<br>  <br>  For fat loss, do not remove all carbs from your diet, you need them to fuel your training, but try to cut out sugars and refined carbs, on nutritional labels the lower the percentage of total carbohydrates that come from sugars the better, so whole wheat, whole grain, brown rice, those are the way to go.|`|65f96a3f83910747fd7abf05cccb8ef1aa	yes it is likely you could lose muscle. Not only because you need the energy to use the muscle to help maintain it size but also your body needs the energy. If you take in less energy than you burn or need to use then the body has to get it from somewhere. So it will break down your muscles to use the stored energy as fuel for your body. The trick is to take on the same amount of calories that you burn in a day. Working that out is not easy but as a general rule you don't want to drop below 1200 calories a day and that is absolutely the minimum.

If you also go low carb it will be hard to maintain energy, and thus muscle will not grow. You should  be able to maintain muscle mass but not bulk up.

m6rUxHVFaa	A BRIEF HISTORY OF AIDS<br>  <br>  In the early 80's, doctors started seeing more and more people with suppressed immune systems coming into emergency rooms with several opportunistic infections. These were primarily gay men and intravenous drug users. There was<br>  panic within the gay community and in the general population as more and more people began dying of what was called AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.<br>  <br>  In 1984, Robert Gallo, a research scientist working for the National Institute of Health (NIH), announced in a press conference that he had discovered the probable cause of AIDS, and that it was a retrovirus later called HIV: Human<br>  Immunodeficiency Virus. Without having published his findings for peer review he announced this to the press. The media immediately ran with it, and people began demanding funding into research into HIV, all based on the assumption that<br>  HIV is a sexually-transmitted pathogen that causes AIDS. <br>  <br>  The gay community especially rallied and pushed for more AIDS funding and better education about 'safe sex'. In 1987 a drug called AZT was approved by the FDA for the treatment<br>  of AIDS, and this began a multi-billion dollar industry.<br>  <br>  RETROVIRUSES DO NOT CAUSE DISEASE<br>  <br>  HIV is a normal retrovirus. Its genetic composition does not differ very much from other retroviruses. No retrovirus has ever been shown to cause disease outside of a lab. Unlike ordinary viruses, retroviruses do not kill their host cells. Retroviruses occur naturally inside of the cells of many animals, including humans. Retroviruses are seen by many scientists to be naturally occurring parts of our cells. Retroviruses are not sexually-transmitted, but they are passed from mother to child. Retroviruses had been studied by the NIH extensively throughout the 70's in hopes that they would find a retrovirus that caused cancer. Because retroviruses do not kill cells, they were a perfect candidate for cancer, in which cells do not die but instead multiply rapidly.<br>  <br>  Millions of dollars went into all of this research into retroviruses with nothing to show for it. Gallo himself tried to prove more than once that he had found a disease-causing retrovirus, only to be debunked by the scientific community. When AIDS appeared, Gallo and the NIH were already looking for a<br>  disease that they could blame on a retrovirus, to justify all of their wasted funding.<br>  <br>  HIV HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND<br>  <br>  HIV has never been isolated from human blood. What AIDS researchers call isolation of HIV is the finding of certain chemicals and enzymatic activity that they claim indicates the presence of HIV. They find proteins and genetic material thought to come from HIV, or they find reverse transcriptase activity.<br>  <br>  But none of these proteins, RNA strands, or enzyme activities are unique to HIV.<br>  <br>  What most AIDS scientists research in their labs is a lab artifact. It is HIV that is created and grown in a lab, and it is thought to be the same thing that causes AIDS when it infects people.<br>  <br>  THE TEST DOES NOT FIND HIV<br>  <br>  The test for HIV does not look for an actual virus in your blood. It looks for antibodies that will react with a set of proteins that are produced by HIV. But none of these proteins are specific to HIV. Antibodies in the blood resulting<br>  from other conditions can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test. Blood must be diluted before being tested for HIV. Without dilution, all blood samples would test positive for HIV because we all have some antibodies that will cross-react with the test. There are at least 66 factors that are known to<br>  cause false positive results on an HIV test, including other infections, drug use, and receptive anal sex. Having unprotected receptive anal sex causes your body to produce antibodies in response to semen. <br>  <br>  These antibodies to semen can cross-react with the proteins in the HIV test, producing a false positive result. In addition, people of African descent have a higher probability of<br>  testing false positive, because they naturally have a greater variety of antibodies in their blood.<br>  <br>  NO GOLD STANDARD FOR HIV TESTING<br>  <br>  HIV tests are not standardized. This is because HIV has never been isolated from human blood, so there is no way to know how specific the tests are to HIV infection. The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve a single HIV<br>  test for the diagnosis of HIV infection. There are a variety of tests, and the results are interpreted differently in different countries. So the same sample of blood could test positive in the United States while testing negative in Europe. Another more expensive HIV test is the viral load test. Viral load<br>  testing makes use of PCR: polymerase chain reaction. It takes a very small amount of genetic material and makes enough copies of it that you can detect it.<br>  <br>  Dr. Kary Mullis, who won a Nobel prize for inventing PCR, is among the scientists who say that HIV does not cause AIDS. He claims that viral load testing is a misuse of PCR. PCR does not find isolated virus in the blood. It finds pieces of RNA strands thought to belong to HIV.<br>  <br>  PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES MEANS IMMUNITY<br>  <br>  Usually, if you test positive for antibodies that means that your immune system has effectively fought off a pathogen and you now have immunity. But with the HIV test, the logic is reversed. Instead of meaning that you now have immunity to HIV, testing positive is said to mean that you are infected and your immune<br>  system has failed to neutralize the virus. The great hope for many who believe that HIV causes AIDS is that researchers will some day develop a vaccine. But vaccines work by causing your body to produce antibodies specific to a pathogen.<br>  If a vaccine for HIV was created, everyone who had the vaccine would then test positive for HIV on the non-specific antibody tests now in use.<br>  <br>  AZT SUPPRESSES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>  <br>  The original drug used to treat people with AIDS, called AZT, was not created for AIDS treatment. AZT was originally developed in the 70's as a chemotherapy drug for cancer patients, but it was not approved because it was determined to<br>  be too toxic. Chemotherapy for cancer patients is limited to a certain duration, while AZT and similar drugs are prescribed to AIDS patients for the rest of their lives. The study that lead to FDA approval for AZT has now been shown to have been fraudulent. The package for AZT says: "TOXIC. Toxic by<br>  inhalation, in contact with skin and if swallowed. Wear suitable protective clothing." Among other side effects, AZT destroys the bone marrow of the body.<br>  <br>  The reason doctors see an initial rise in their patients' T cell count after taking AZT is because the bone marrow is where T cells are produced. AZT destroys the bone marrow and this releases more T cells from the marrow into the blood. Prolonged use of AZT has been shown to suppress the immune system and lower T cell counts. About 95% of AIDS-related deaths have occurred since the release of AZT.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRAL SIDE EFFECT LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH<br>  <br>  The newer protease inhibitors used in combo therapy are also a type of chemotherapy. They work by preventing the replication of genetic material belonging to HIV. But these proteins are not specific to HIV, and the protease<br>  inhibitors do not exclusively target HIV. The highest cause of death today for people with AIDS is liver failure. Liver failure is not an AIDS-defining illness, but it is a known side-effect of the protease inhibitors. AIDS patients can see the disappearance of some symptoms while taking the drug cocktails. This is because the drugs they are taking are global poisons that<br>  kill many microbes in the body that may be pathogenic, such as bacteria and other viruses.<br>  <br>  ANTIRETROVIRALS NOT PROVEN TO IMPROVE HEALTH<br>  <br>  The drug companies claim that the release of protease inhibitors in 1996 was responsible for decreased deaths due to AIDS. But deaths from AIDS had already begun a declining trend three years before in 1993, and the introduction of<br>  protease inhibitors did not significantly alter this trend. Studies are no longer comparing AIDS drugs with a placebo. Now when they test a new antiretroviral drug they compare a group taking the new drug with a group that is taking the older drugs. There are no studies being done comparing the difference in health between people taking the AIDS medications and people who are not taking the drugs, though many HIV positive people lead healthy lives free of disease for many years, without taking AIDS medication.<br>  <br>  CDC REDEFINES AIDS TO INCREASE NUMBERS<br>  <br>  AIDS statistics can be very misleading. This is because of the many definitions for AIDS that have been used by different countries and at different times.<br>  <br>  Originally, in the United States you had to test HIV positive and have one or more of the AIDS-defining illnesses to be counted as somebody with AIDS. In 1993 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) expanded this definition to include<br>  anyone who tested positive for HIV and had a T cell count of under 200. This nearly tripled the perceived number of AIDS cases in the US. Many of the people who have AIDS by this definition are perfectly healthy, and would not be<br>  considered to have AIDS if they moved to Canada.<br>  <br>  AIDS IN AFRICA CAUSED BY POVERTY<br>  <br>  Today we are told that ridiculously large numbers of people in Africa are HIV positive and will die of AIDS unless treated. These statistics are not counts of people who have actually tested positive. It is an estimation generated from<br>  a sample population. The sample population is primarily pregnant women, who are the ones who get priority for medical treatment in poor countries. But pregnancy is known to be a source for false positive results on HIV tests. And<br>  people of African descent in general are more likely to test false positive.<br>  <br>  The World Health Organization does not require a positive HIV test for the diagnosis of AIDS in Africa. All that is required is a certain number of symptoms. But all of these symptoms can also be explained by malnutrition, malaria, and tuberculosis, conditions that have been health risks for Africans<br>  long before the invention of AIDS. The health of poor Africans would undoubtedly be improved with better food and sanitation. <br>  <br>  But funding is now being geared towards delivery of toxic AIDS medications to Africans rather than for these basic essentials.<br>  <br>  AIDS DEFINES ITSELF<br>  <br>  Clearly many people have died in this country and elsewhere as the result of a suppressed immune system. But the 29 AIDS-defining illnesses are not new illnesses, and they all have previously documented causes and treatments.<br>  <br>  Diagnosis of AIDS now works like a formula. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV negative, you are told you have pneumonia. If you have pneumonia and you test HIV positive, you are told you have AIDS and you are treated with toxic<br>  AIDS drugs. For those people who are truly immune suppressed, there are other possible explanations for this phenomenon, and many safe non-toxic therapies.<br>  <br>  DRUGS AND MALNUTRITION CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  If the true condition of AIDS is a suppressed immune system unable to fight off opportunistic infections, there are many other factors that can cause this.<br>  <br>  Drugs such as cocaine and crystal methane are known to suppress the immune system. These drugs were used extensively by many gay men in the 1970's and 1980's. Intravenous drug users who have AIDS are said to be immune suppressed due to HIV, rather than due to the drug they have been injecting.<br>  <br>  Corticosteroids and some antibiotics, often prescribed to drug addicts and promiscuous gay men, are also immune suppressive. Blood given to hemophiliacs and other transplant recipients used to be treated with immune suppressing<br>  agents. Now with a new way to treat this blood, AIDS among blood recipients has declined. Despite predictions of a global epidemic, AIDS cases in the United States have remained confined to its original primary risk groups: promiscuous<br>  gay men and intravenous drug users. In the gay party scene, drug use, malnutrition, and sleep deprivation continue to be high risk factors for immune deficiency.<br>  <br>  POPPERS CAUSE KAPOSI'S SARCOMA<br>  <br>  Kaposi's Sarcoma is one of the AIDS-indicator diseases, but it primarily occurs in gay men and not other AIDS groups. Nitrite inhalants or poppers, used extensively by gay men in the 70's and 80's, have been shown to cause Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS). KS is a cancer of the blood vessels. Nitrites are known<br>  carcinogens. KS is usually seen in gay men around the face, mouth, and in the lungs, all sites of contact with nitrite fumes.<br>  <br>  There are many recorded incidents of KS in HIV-negative gay men who used poppers. As the use of poppers decreased in the 90's, the incidence of KS also decreased. Poppers are still<br>  used by many gay men.<br>  <br>  FEAR ALONE CAN CAUSE AIDS<br>  <br>  Fear and anxiety is another factor that can suppress the immune system. Stress releases cortisol in the body. This cortisol is used to help break down tissues for the release of energy needed in a fight or flight situation. But prolonged<br>  stress and anxiety creates abnormally high levels of cortisol in the body.<br>  <br>  Cortisol has been shown to suppress the immune system and decrease T cell counts. Irregular sleep or lack of sleep also increases cortisol levels. Gay men who face discrimination and hatred for their sexuality can experience chronic fear and anxiety. Intravenous drug users also face a lot of chronic<br>  fear and paranoia as part of their addiction. Testing positive for HIV itself can create huge amounts of fear in the person being diagnosed.<br>  <br>  GREAT VIDEO<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com.au/videoplay?docid=3983706668483511310&q=deconstructing+the+my" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com.au/videoplay?doc...</a>|`|49162eecae8e9d33265ef4f07a44af10aa	here is some info and links from the internet..<br>  <br>  How long after a possible exposure should I wait to get tested for HIV?<br>  <br>  Most HIV tests are antibody tests that measure the antibodies your body makes against HIV. It can take some time for the immune system to produce enough antibodies for the antibody test to detect and this time period can vary from person to person. This time period is commonly referred to as the “window period”. Most people will develop detectable antibodies within 2 to 8 weeks (the average is 25 days). Even so, there is a chance that some individuals will take longer to develop detectable antibodies. Therefore, if the initial negative HIV test was conducted within the first 3 months after possible exposure, repeat testing should be considered >3 months after the exposure occurred to account for the possibility of a false-negative result. Ninety seven percent will develop antibodies in the first 3 months following the time of their infection. In very rare cases, it can take up to 6 months to develop antibodies to HIV. <br>  Another type of test is an RNA test, which detects the HIV virus directly. The time between HIV infection and RNA detection is 9-11 days. These tests, which are more costly and used less often than antibody tests, are used in some parts of the United States.<br>  For information on HIV testing, you can talk to your health care provider or you can find the location of the HIV testing site nearest to you by visiting the National HIV Testing Resources Web site at <a href="http://www.hivtest.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.hivtest.org</a> or call CDC-INFO 24 Hours/Day at1-800-CDC-INFO (232-4636), 1-888-232-6348 (TTY), in English, en Espa?ol.

Good luck.|`|jEbhxeREaa	Well, it could.  However, a negative test at 3 weeks should not stop you from getting tested again at 3 months.  3 months is when the test is performing at its best to give you the correct answer.|`|zsRJaODdaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  There is a "window period" which is the time it takes the body to produce antibodies after HIV infection has begun. For the vast majority of those who will test positive, antibodies to HIV will develop within 4-6 weeks after exposure. Some will take a little longer to develop antibodies. To make certain that you receive a reliable test result, it's necessary to wait at least three months (13 weeks) after your last possible exposure to the virus before being tested. <br>  <br>  Getting tested before three months may result in an unclear result or a false negative. Some testing centers may recommend testing again at six months. All but less than 1% of those who are going to seroconvert will do so within three months (seroconversion is the development of detectable antibodies to HIV in the blood as a result of infection.) It's extremely rare for seroconversion to take more than six months to develop detectable antibodies.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps clarify things for you.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

jR5kvXgeaa	dont count calories burned because there is no way you can know it precisely, machinse dont know it. Count time doing cardio - 30-50min 4-6 times a week (the first 20-30min body burns carbs and only then start burning fat)
AA11234500	The only thing I can think of is maybe adding weights.  I didn't see that you do that at the gym, only cardio.  The combination of the two should help.  Are you bloated or just have some extra flab?  If it's really bloating, watch how many whole grains your eating, too much of them  can cause this, same with fruits.  Eating protein and veggies instead of lots of bread will help this...really watch anything refined in your diet.  Also, cardio is great for tummy but you must target train in addition to your cardio to see more results.  Good Luck!
Z0SiMz7daa	I am a little confuse about the "chemicals" in a humidifier.  Cool water humidifiers shouldn't produce any chemicals but I guess if you are concerned you could use distilled water instead.  Another possibility is to run the shower on hot and that will increase the humidity in the air but it won't humidify a very large area.      Try not running the heat as much or as high in the house.  Drink plenty of fluids and avoid and decongestants because these will dry you up.  If dry skin is an issue try baby lotion or Keri lotion after showers.|`|ybdNwzMBaa	use the ice form your fridge,put in stones in a dish put the ice on them this will help to start you of.Get some battery top up water this distiled water has no chemicals|`|t9IrZHqJaa	If you use a propane heater, the process of burning the propane will heat the area as well as humidify the air.

This would be good if you are a busy person that has no time to go to a gym. Just go out and buy a video that specifies that it works that area and do it in your free time at home. You do not need hard core videos, make sure you pick one that looks fun, because if it is not fun you will not do it and it will be a waste. But these videos are good and it will be effective.<br>  Not your style?<br>  If you are a member of a gym, or plan to be. Ask one of the Personal trainers there to show you gluteus exercises- they will be happy to show you. Or if you are shy, just read the machines they have a card that tells you what muscles are worked for each machine. There are a few really great machines that have shrunk and lifted my bottom like crazy, and in only a few months at that. But you have to make that bottom work, heavy weight 8-10 reps 2 sets- don't hurt yourself but if you whimp out you are doing nothing.<br>  Still not your style?<br>  WALK. go out for walks, every evening, or in the morning. Walking tones up legs and bottoms and is all around good for you. But (ha ha ha get it BUTT, ugh sorry that was cheezy) remember anything you do is going to take time, you have to be patient and stick with it. After 2  months you will see results, and it will be worth it.<br>  Good luck!|`|nd2cgfr8aa	The exercises listed are great for this part of the body, but they will not 'tone' you.  Toning, as it is used so often, requires a decrease in body fat.  In order to do this, one must expend more energy than they take in.  The best way to control body fat is by diet and exercise.  How are your eating habits?  Dropping body fat is not easy.  It takes lots of discipline in the kitchen.  No junk food, no skipping meals, no out of control portions.  You can eat well and lose weight, but you must eat the right things.  Follow your diet up with intense cardio to create a caloric deficit big enough to cause weight loss. Once the body fat is low enough, your rear will be defined and firmed.

Then in your freetime instead of eating those ever-so-tempting snacks, do some push-ups, sit-ups, wall sits, and use any excersise equipment available to you.  You will gain weight at first, but you will start to lose it and become healthier.  Also, watch what you eat and drink.  Try fruits, vegetables, and water.  No soda!!|`|5edcfc1233cb89d3d8dd435a0b313dd1aa	why finances? you can do this easily on your own you just need motivation. :)<br>  <br>  start cutting down your calories and eat 4-5 meals a day (small meals though). also try running every other day and or any other cardio excersise. maybe sign up for a gym and start doing some weight lifting. (this is the only thing you will need to pay for) old fashion sit ups and crunches still work the best. <br>  maybe you can get a friend to join you going to the gym or running.

Having that person be by your side no matter what comes down the road!! Knowing that person will be by your side when you are in a coma for 5 days and the doctors not knowing if you are going to live or die. That person sitting by your side holding your hand hoping you can hear them when they are talking to you . Trying to get that person to hear you so you will come back to them!!!<br>  Then when you do wake up and see that person holding your hand and know they have been there with you for those 5 days.

If you followed a healthy diet and used the elliptical, you would probably get better results. Here is what I wrote for another person who asked a similar question....<br>  If you eat healthy and follow my plan, I bet you will lose a lot, but you have to stick to the new healthy lifestyle. <br>  On Sunday, eat a high protein, low fat diet. Have an egg white and tomatoe omelette for breakfast, have a can of Tuna in water for lunch and grilled or broiled chicken for dinner with a veggie. Anything protein will be fine and you can eat anything high in protein all day. <br>  Starting on Monday all the way through Thursday or Friday, eat only fruits and vegetables. It's best if you can eat them fresh adn raw, but you can also steam your vegetables and you can have them out of a can or frozen, but only if you must. You can only use seasonings, like sea salt or Mrs. Dash to flavor them......no butter or any other condiments. Fresh, steamed and raw are the best for you. You can only drink water and unsweetened tea. You can eat fruit and veggies all day - no limit. <br>  You can start adding protein Chicken and Tuna, at the end of <br>  the week.....Thursday or Friday. No fast food ever again unless it's a plain garden salad. Try to use lemon or red wine vinegar as your salad dressing. Subway has red wine vinegar and they have a good veggie salad. <br>  After the week is over, limit your bread intake and if you have a need for carbs, stay away from any carbs with Gluten in the ingredients.....this will consist of breads and pasta. Corn is fine, like corn tortillas, or homemade corn bread without white flour. Rice will be fine at this point too, preferably brown rice....even brown minute rice. One recipe that I love is corn tortillas with sliced grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce and tomatillo sauce.<br>  Fat free is a big part of this diet, but a little olive oil cooking spray is fine and fat from avocadoes if fine too. You need a little. EXERCISE IS ALSO IMPORTANT!<br>  Plan before you diet. Go to the store and buy cantelope, honeydew, mangos, cucumbers, carrots and every kind of fruit and veggie you can imagine. Prepare it all in gladware and baggies to make it convenient to grab when you are on the run. If you continue to eat healthy, fruits, veggies, lean protein, rice and corn products.....I will bet that fat will melt off of you and you will feel great!! I wish you the best of luck and I hope it works for you!!<br>  <br>  Please know that I am not a nutritionist or a doctor. I write this with the expectations that you know your limits and that you are healthy and fit enough to go on a "cleansing" diet for 4 to 5 days. I follow this diet...or life style I should say and I am a healthy 135 pounds at 42.|`|4bb000697f30389b8006b507ee8097fcaa	Well I'm not sure if its possible to lose a pound a day, but try eating a lot of greens, and fruits, and antioxidants.

When you have unprotected sex with a person you really are having sex with everyone they have ever had sex with before you.  Many people can be carriers of various stds, not show any signs or symptoms, and hence not really know that they have it.  You do not need to be experiencing symptoms to pass on the virus to someone else and infect them.  Unless you are in a committed monogamous relationship where both partners have reliably tested negative for stds, every time you have sex you need to play it safe.  Part of that also means getting tested for all stds at least once a year during routine anual check-up; every 6 months if your behaviours are more risky in nature.<br>  <br>  Cheers.

0fcf3be362969ff3aed14c3092d794d9aa	You are not alone...Sometimes it is easiest to lash out at those closest to us rather than deal with the real issue(s) at hand.  I've been known to do it myself.  What helps me is to remember way back when...all those years ago when I fell in love with my husband.  I try to remember why I loved him so and how I felt all giddy at the mention of his name.  Times have changed and let's face it...there is NO mystery left anymore...but I can control my own behaviors, emotions, and my reactions.  If I choose to, I can hold myself accountable for my own actions and stop blaming, for that accomplishes nothing but hurt feelings.  Rather than place blame find out what the issue is and focus on a solution.  Often times it matters not who did what or said what...those things become irrelevant once you've decided to focus on the resolution.  <br>  <br>  You can not control an others behavior...only your own.  Once you've decided that no one else has the power or control to determine your day, your mood, your reaction...Then you have gained a greater inner strength and wisdom.  Being accountable for ones self and actions is great step toward a happier and healthier relationship and a more confident you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.  It is a life skill which requires much patience, tolerance, and yes humility.  Would you rather be right or would you rather be happy?|`|TyDMvaU5aa	You already addressed the problem.  Normally, you can't when you don't realize the problem itself.  But you already did so it's easier for you to stop blaming your husband...<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean you shouldn't if he is really at fault, but it would help to put yourself in his shoes first and assess the situation before starting to point fingers.<br>  <br>  If you can't help but impulsively blame him right away, never hesitate to apologize as soon as you realize your mistake and make up for it.  Be more conscious of your actions... <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|phU61BtKaa	bklame urself|`|eRyVH2wMaa	i do the same thing when u get mad leave the room
7cfb0846da8e065cc9deb4a72a2b76d6aa	I'm sorry, but yes.  Chances are good that you are going to fit the definition of morbidly obese.  I'm not an expert on BMI and the clinical definitions, but I think morbidly obese is defined as a BMI of 40.  BMI is calculated as the mass in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/(m*m)).  I think you would be about 36.  There are, however, some additional factors that play into the definition of clinical morbid obesity such as race, waist circumference, age, sex, etc.  There is no question you would qualify as obese, but you are also pushing the bounds of the definition of morbidly obese.<br>  <br>  For a man your size, 20 lb dumbells is not that heavy.  That indicates that you aren't very muscular, and most of your mass is probably fat.  Musculature is about the only thing that would make you less likely to be diagnosed as obese.<br>  <br>  At your age and size, you can expect lots of health complications in the future.  You need to start changing your lifestyle now, and not later.  Cut out pizza and hamburgers and fast food (I know, I love em too).  Start eating chicken and fish a lot more often in place of red meat.  Avoid heavy caloric foods like pasta and cream sauces.  You don't want a stroke at 30, or a heartattack.<br>  <br>  You also need to start exercising.  I think there is a nice training program called "From Couch Potato to 5k" on how to train for a 5k run.  For the first few weeks, it is mostly walking.  Also, see a trainer at your local gym for a weight lifting regimen--resting muscle burns more calories than resting fat, so the stronger you get, the easier it will be to keep burning off fat.<br>  <br>  Oh, and whoever called you a fatso is an ***.  That kind of rudeness is a sad comment on their character.  However, if it got you thinking (obviously it made you feel bad), some good may come of it.  Use their rudeness to your benefit.<br>  <br>  Really, you need to make some changes.  This is a good opportunity.  Don't waste it!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	no ur big because of ur height dont stress|`|DphSnljBaa	Go to:<br>  <a href="http://naafa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://naafa.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bodypositive.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodypositive.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://fatso.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fatso.com/</a><br>  <br>  Worry about eating the best things for your body and exercise because moving your body can be fun-- not body size, the number on the scale, or what the media/Hollywood tells you to be.<br>  <br>  You can be fat and healthly and BEAUTIFUL!|`|adaae228b0c249400ce504ff74958af3aa	not to sound horrid, but 280lb is rather a lot. its all about burning off calories you consume by getting regular exercise and eating the recommended calorie intake, and trying not to exceed that. try getting to a gym and having a consultation with a personal trainer|`|b1b4c7e3c4dc736e7fc6ad879408010daa	If you are concerned about your weight, try making some slight changes.

Okay if this is spelled accurately then what you're experiencing  may be due to a pinched nerve or your prostate.<br>  If this is spelled incorrectly then you're probably going to have to rewrite this question. When you rewrite it please explain if you're speaking of the shaft area which entails the area below the prepuce (top) to where the penis ends and testes unite. Or it could be foreskin????  Since you know that it isn't an STD then you must have gone to your physician. Did you mention that you have an irritated area of inflammation? generally inflammation is a sign of infection which could range from being allergic to the fabric your underwear is made from or a latex allergy from the spandex in your underwear. As well as overgrowth of yeast in the affected area. there are two known irritations/ infections Balanitis and Posthitis the latter involves the foreskin. Although you say it isn't an STD when you were checked....did you asked about the chances of it being chlamydia? The test given for this isn't routinely performed and not the same as for other STD tests. I hope you will rewrite your question so that you can get the answer you seek~

jgatYJ3Zaa	Before reporting them to the school, please give them a stern warning that they are being watched and could get into serious trouble for sexual harassment.  Our society has begun to take this type of treatment very seriously (sometimes maybe overboard) and a report could cause suspension or worse.  Remember that in their own immature way they are expressing an attraction to you, however inappropriate the means.  A warning may work and it won't cause you to be the rat who got them in trouble.  Peer pressure is tough enough without causing a few guys to get into serious trouble (look for news reports about 8 year olds suspended or expelled for a kiss) for showing attraction to you.  You could go from being the object of their affection, to being the object of their hate.  That is just a reality of youth.  Good luck!|`|90b96411e787348fedfd9dbaaf9c538daa	Guys are fascinated by hooters. It's the way we're wired and we never grow out of it. But that doesn't excuse the offensive behavior you describe. It has a lot to do with the culture.<br>  <br>  You've seen TV sitcoms? Pretty trashy aren't they? Along with trashy movies, porn, video games, etc --  this is where kids are getting their social education. This is the only cultural instruction most kids will ever get. It's sad but true.<br>  <br>  Doesn't mean you have to put up with it.

In other words, guys that age are beginning to have sexual feelings, but trying to do personal things with a girl are not right.  It doesn't mean they're perverts, though, but I definitely would try not to be anywhere alone with them, and if they keep it up, tell somebody.|`|bwH1tSWRaa	I went through the same thing when I went to school.They are just very immature and need attention.Give it to them by telling your teacher,I bet they will stop.Good luck.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	all teenage boys are sorry there all imature they will grow out of it soon|`|fe4eeb0dee04aba94808d591ba4c8b49aa	It is puberty.  Boys have all these hormones raging just like you do right now.  Unfortunately, this is how they chose to deal with it.  They are letting you know they have noticed your figure and approve. Snapping your bra is a way of touching you without the other guys making fun of him for liking you.  They are fascinated with you right now.  I don't think you should have to put up with being touched when you don't want to be.  You should tell a teacher or an adult you trust.  Maybe they can do something about it without making you look bad.  Good luck.  It doesn't last forever.  Another year and they will be afraid to even talk to you.|`|6FAwBuwgaa	It all stems from genetics and evolution.<br>  <br>  Domestic dogs still 'wolf' down their dinners because way back when, if they didn't they wouldn't have time to eat.

It is an impulse carried through generations.<br>  <br>  Stay with me here!<br>  <br>  Similarly human males used to hunt, protect and procreate. These urges still rear their ugly heads now. Exhibited in male competition, ego and in your case, immature acts.<br>  <br>  In todays society there is no excuse for such peurile behaviour, however it will occur. Especially among those who are developing to their sexual peak and are awash with hormones.<br>  <br>  They need to be asked to stop and relevant people should be informed.<br>  <br>  I am a man myself but I have self control.

x1GspyFQaa	Discovery of tuberculosis in 1702.In 1890, he announced the discovery of tuberculin.<br>  <br>  Robert Koch and Tuberculosis<br>        Koch's Famous Lecture<br>  Robert Koch, Nobel Laureate, 1905.<br>   <br>   <br>  The medal given to Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine.<br>      <br>  <br>  Robert Koch, a German physician and scientist, presented his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), on the evening of March 24, 1882. He began by reminding the audience of terrifying statistics: "If the importance of a disease for mankind is measured by the number of fatalities it causes, then tuberculosis must be considered much more important than those most feared infectious diseases, plague, cholera and the like. One in seven of all human beings dies from tuberculosis. If one only considers the productive middle-age groups, tuberculosis carries away one-third, and often more."<br>  <br>  Koch's lecture, considered by many to be the most important in medical history, was so innovative, inspirational and thorough that it set the stage for the scientific procedures of the twentieth century. He described how he had invented a new staining method and demonstrated it for the audience. Koch brought his entire laboratory to the lecture room: microscopes, test tubes with cultures, glass slides with stained bacteria, dyes, reagents, glass jars with tissue samples, etc. He wanted the audience to check his findings for themselves. Koch showed tissue dissections from guinea pigs which were infected with tuberculous material from the lungs of infected apes, from the brains and lungs of humans who had died from blood-borne tuberculosis, from the cheesy masses in lungs of chronically infected patients and from the abdominal cavities of cattle infected with TB. In all cases, the disease which had developed in the experimentally infected guinea pigs was the same, and the cultures of bacteria taken from the infected guinea pigs were identical. One important scientist in the audience was Paul Ehrlich (Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine in 1908) who later confessed, "I hold that evening to be the most important experience of my scientific life." When Koch ended his lecture there was complete silence. No questions, no congratulations, no applause. The audience was stunned. Slowly people got up and started looking into the microscopes to see the TB bacteria with their own eyes.<br>  <br>  News of Koch's discovery spread rapidly. The results were published in a German medical journal on April 10, in England after a rapid translation in The Times on April 22, and in the US in The New York Times on May 3, 1882. Robert Koch was now a famous scientist and became known as "The Father of Bacteriology." He was presented with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905 "for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis."|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity. The earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is in the remains of bison dated 17,000 years before the present.[49] However, whether tuberculosis originated in cattle and then transferred to humans, or diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear.[50] Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and tubercular decay has been found in the spines of mummies from 3000-2400 BC|`|eRyVH2wMaa	back in the early 1700's|`|HP6cCY1Eaa	early 1700s|`|Yl9A49MVaa	Tuberculosis was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s , see below articles. <br>  <br>  Although it was established that the pulmonary form was associated with 'tubercles' by Dr Richard Morton in 1689, due to the variety of its symptoms, TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s and was not named 'tuberculosis' until 1839 by J. L. Sch?nlein.  The first TB sanatorium opened in 1859 in G?rbersdorf, Germany.<br>  <br>  Dr. Robert Koch discovered the tuberculosis bacilli.The bacillus causing tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was identified and described on March 24, 1882 by Robert Koch. He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery.Koch did not believe that bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. Later, this source was eliminated by the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it 'tuberculin'. It was not effective, but was later adapted as a test for pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.<br>  <br>  Tuberculosis (TB), contagious, wasting disease caused by any of several mycobacteria. The most common form of the disease is tuberculosis of the lungs (pulmonary consumption, or phthisis), but the intestines, bones and joints, the skin, and the genitourinary, lymphatic, and nervous systems may also be affected.<br>  <br>  There are three major types of tubercle bacilli that affect humans. The human type (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), first identified in 1882 by Robert Koch, is spread by people themselves. It is the most common one. The bovine type (M. bovis) is spread by infected cattle but is no longer a threat in areas where pasteurization of milk and the health of cattle are strictly supervised. The avian type (M. avis) is carried by infected birds but can occur in humans. The tubercle bacillus can live for a considerable period of time in air or dust. The most common means of acquiring the disease is by inhalation of respiratory droplets.

XC1Ea55gaa	You probably have a sinus infection. A doctor can prescribe an antibiotic for that but they are hard to shake and if you're an adult they can last up to a month. The symptoms should subside before that with proper treatment. It basically wreaks havoc on your head and causes buildup of mucus which creates pressure (headaches). It then will cause a post-nasal drip which irritates your throat and ears. My husband gets them sometimes and his doc think it may have something to do with adenoids or other common sinus problems. If it's your first one or if you only get it once in a long while than it's no big deal.|`|NkRy5lFLaa	might be a sinus infection. if you ever feel like ur going to pass out, you have to go see a doctor. <br>  <br>  go to webmd.com and do the symptom checker. it will give you all the diseases you might have that match the symptoms. it's really good.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	sounds like a sinus infection go see a doctor okay|`|AA11519728	It could be a sinus infection or just bad allergies.

AA12069738	The best possible way to reduce your breast and shape and tone them in the process is to do pushups off the ground. there are many variations and i would recommend three that would work the three parts of your chest, the upper pecs, the lower and the middle pecs. <br>  <br>  1) Place your legs on a chair and you would be in a decline position. Start with 15 reps and always make sure that you do not cheat by doing it fast and short! Make sure that you can go as low as possible and push out straight till your elbows are fully extended. Slow is good and pain is your friend! <br>  2) normal push ups with body parallel to the floor and arms placed at shoulder length. Again another 15 would be good. I am asking you to do less repetitions as you will be doing it slow and properly. the more you do like this, the more effective it is. Once you feel the burn in the muscles, every extra repetition you do will do you wonders!<br>  3) The same position as exercise 2, but with your hands placed really close to each other, with your thumbs just touching each other. This will be really difficult, and try to do atleast 10 or work towards 10 repetitions.<br>  <br>  Do this set of repetitions every 2 days with a days break so you dont over work your chest. Overworking is never good as it can do the reverse and damage your muscles. during the days when you are not doing pushups, you could work on your stomachs or go for a jog or something like that<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|eRyVH2wMaa	well if u have noticed the only men that get man boobs are the really fat guys and the guys that smoke weed because weed is stored in the fat cells and after u have smoked so long u create man boobs and u will always have them sorry|`|9db09958436c7b40d03884884294b2c0aa	exercise and most men do go in and get that lipoed for a couple bucks.

I didn't go to the doctor.. only prayed, ...and after a few days it went away, and yeah it was there for a couple weeks.

The only ways I know of are through surgery.<br>  Women are made to utilize whatever a man has to offer. Most of her pleasure centers are very superficial and when properly stimulated her parts adjust to what's present.<br>  <br>  Its mostly a mental and emotional thing for women anyway. Most women primarily want a man that's in good shape, active, works in and around the house, cooks, has a good sense of humor, and does whatever she tells them to do.

189d3d15c868f8a9a7d1acca7422ea51aa	You might have a condition called phimosis where the foreskin opening is too tight/narrow for it to be retracted fully.  This is very easily remedied.  You might also have some adhesions between your foreskin and your glans (penis head).  Depending on how old you are, this can be normal.<br>  <br>  If it's phimosis, there are many different kinds of treatments.  You should first start out with stretching exercises (see link 1).  If after a month or so and little progress, then you should ask a doctor about certain creams; in one study, these creams are the most cost-effective treatment a doctor can give (see link 2).  Lastly there are surgical interventions.  Note that this doesn't necessarily mean circumcision, as there are other options that are cheaper, less painful, remove little/no foreskin, and have a quicker recovery time (see link 3).  Regardless, surgery should be reserved as a last resort, as usually the stretching and/or the creams will work in the majority of cases.<br>  <br>  If your foreskin opening is "large enough" then it might be adhesions.  Adhesions are common (and normal) before puberty and usually resolve themselves by the end of puberty.  You can remedy this fairly easily yourself too.  When taking a shower/bath, pull your foreskin as far back as it'll go comfortably.  Just stretch and hold your foreskin as far back as it'll go for a few seconds under warm water, then let it relax, then repeat the process for a few minutes.  This'll help loosen and detach the adhesions painlessly.  This could take a few weeks to a month to resolve.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, there's a procedure a doctor can do to manually separate the adhesions; I don't know if it's painful, but I'm sure it's uncomfortable.  But at least it'll be over with and you should have a normally functioning foreskin afterwards (as long as you maintain good hygiene).<br>  <br>  See the links for more info, and good luck with whatever you try.|`|AA10201034	When foreskin is so tight to don't move freely down/up around the glans so to uncovering/covering it completely, is a disease called Phymosis. To avoid possible infection and an unsatisfying sexual life it's opportune to treat it, though only a surgery will remove it. According to the gravity of the Phymosis the operation can be a simple cut or an entire circumcision.|`|c85af947133f3026f95aa00dc0c60fe1aa	My guess is that you're young, like a teen (based on your username).<br>  <br>  If so, it will slide back more and more as you 'use' it more. =)<br>  <br>  When you shower slide it back and rub the head. That'll encourage it to "separate" from the head.<br>  <br>  And on the bottom of penis, the frenulum holds the foreskin to the head, just like the frenulum holds your lips and tongue, to prevent it from sliding back too much.<br>  <br>  And even if it is phimosis, surgery (circumcision) is not required to treat it. You can stretch it gently and get a cream for like $12, which works in almost 95% of cases, has fewer risks, and is painless compared to surgery. 0.05% betamethasone<br>  <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1677-55382005000400012&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S167...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/pharmacy/prices/drugprice.asp?ndc=00168005546&trx=1Z5006" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/pharmacy/prices...</a><br>  <br>  That and you don't risk losing sensitivity/pleasure or making masturbation more difficult like circumcision can do according to studies in the British Journal of Urology.<br>  <a href="http://forums.govteen.com/showpost.php?p=3069995&postcount=2" rel="nofollow">http://forums.govteen.com/showpost.php?p...</a>|`|eRyVH2wMaa	yes it is when u get circumsized they cut that off so ur head shows
29M7lVMwaa	Passing urine during intercourse, and being unable to control it, happens to many women. No one seems to talk about this, so a sufferer thinks she is the only one with the problem. <br>  <br>  A doctor did a survey of women attending his urogynaecology clinic (many of whom of course already had an incontinence problem) and found that 24% had incontinence during intercourse (British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology 1988;95:377–81). Most had felt too embarrassed to mention it to their doctor.  In about two-thirds, the leakage occurs when the penis enters the vagina (penetration). In about one-third, the leakage occurs only at orgasm.<br>  <br>  What causes it? The reason is not understood, but it is likely to be partly due to an irritable bladder or a weakness at the neck of the bladder. If you have difficulty holding urine during the day, you may experience leakage during intercourse. However, many women have leakage of urine during intercourse but not at any other time. Could it be ‘female ejaculation’? <br>  <br>  In 1950, a Dr Grafenberg described what he called “female ejaculation ... the expulsion of large quantities of clear transparent fluid at the height of orgasm”. Some sex manuals still talk about this ‘female ejaculation’ as if it were some kind of discharge of sexual glands. They claim it comes from Skene’s glands, which are supposed to be similar to the prostate gland in men. <br>  <br>  People who believe in ‘female ejaculation’ say that analysis of this fluid reveals high levels of an enzyme called acid phosphatase that is made by prostate-type gland tissue. In fact: 1) a study in six women showed that their ‘female ejaculate’ fluid contained the same amount of acid phosphatase as their urine; 2) a study of just one woman did find high levels of acid phosphatase in the fluid she released at orgasm, but the method used to analyze it was unreliable.|`|19056bce1e43bd55d5f31cd8918ef456aa	I guess it happens to some people, make a habit to go before sex.|`|AA10798473	that could happen to an one.|`|AA11595482	very strong orgass oftan result in women peeing a little.<br>  you need one hell of a pat on the back for hitting all the right spots. thats all!|`|FbdCdaXAaa	that is not a 'golden shower' but some women when they have an orgazm they have a lot of fluid..maybe you hit her G-spot, and maybe it was 'pee' but nothing to worry about....|`|T26eIFn9aa	well that sometimes happens when a girl climax's, just like when a man ejaculates, but theres no sperm in it|`|WqCikKWPaa	good for you both|`|zUq7FkdKaa	no it's not bad are you sure it was a golden shower & she isn't just a heavy cummer|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	No she ejaculated.

They are simply naturally more active (due to nice weather usually), eat very heatlhy and aren't concerend or obsessed with dieting like we are in north america because it's not an issue for them. That bieng said, in recent years europe and surronding areas have really "americanized." It used to be that fast food didn't exist, but now that chains have been opening it has become a novelty for them and I've noticed more overweight people. In general, there are a LOT less overweight and obese (i'm talking like 300lb people--I didn't single a single person that big when I was there) in europe. But, yes, your right, there are overweight people there too. <br>  <br>  You're not fat at all; in fact you sound anorexic, but you are only 13 so you'll grow.|`|aaxqGEmWaa	America is a large industrial country with a peculiarly fast lifestyle. In a city with a population of some million, people who work there have to deal with traffic, overcrowding and generaly many time-consuming situations. So people  look for more convinient ways to save time on every oportunity. When it comes to food, they tend to eat at fast foods that will save them valuable cooking time. And because food that's not homemade is usually more unhealthy it causes them to steadily gain health problems including fatness.<br>  <br>  It is also because of the passive lifestyle in which people prefer to stay home and watch Tv than go out for a walk in a overcrowded and poluted enviroment. They stay home, they turn into couch potatoes and then they develop habbits like home delivery for food, constant refridgerator-dig-in, and no movement.<br>  <br>  These are mailnly the problems that cause over-weightness to people living in huge cities not only in America but anywhere around the world.
rEm6MuVmaa	always remember to touch the tips of your tongue that is a stimulation point|`|44e1a70a1aff5fb050d5c8f9305b52c5aa	Set the scene. Make sure that the mood and time are right.<br>  Relax! Take a deep breath and let go of any tension in your neck and shoulders.<br>  Put your arms around the person you want to kiss.<br>  Start off with a normal kiss, not too firm, not too aggressive. Closing your eyes is optional.<br>  In mid kiss, gently open your mouth and softly nudge the other persons mouth open using your tongue.<br>  Again, not too aggressively, move your tongue inside the other persons mouth and playfully touch their tounge.<br>  Read the other persons body language, if they seem tense or start to pull away, stop what you are doing.<br>  If they open their mouth more or otherwise indicate they like the kiss, keep on doing what you have been only with a little more passion.<br>  As the kissing gets going saliva build up can be a problem, don't forget to swallow.<br>  Make sure you keep your tongues relaxed but your lips tight (saliva again), you don't want the kiss to turn messy.<br>  Tips:<br>  Don't forget to breathe.<br>  Since French Kissing is "wetter" than other kinds of kissing it is a good idea to start with dry lips, don't lick them first.<br>  If one of you have braces you can still French Kiss, you just have to be more careful and not as forceful when things get passionate.<br>  If both of you wear braces you can still French Kiss, you just have to be very gentle and avoid touching teeth.<br>  French Kissing takes practice, but at least it is fun to practice this one!|`|eRyVH2wMaa	move ur tongue all over his

AA12091376	Yes, but it isn't likely.  Herpes is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact so it is possible.  There have been cases reported where Rugby players got Herpes from close physical contact.  However, the probability of this happening is very small.  <br>  <br>  Also, Herpes can occur any anywhere on the body so getting it on your nose is possible.  The site of preference for HSV1 is around the lips and HSV2 is in the genital area.

x8qomwGwaa	Make sure he leaves some room on the end.  If he is rolling it so it fits his penis exactly...it will pull and tear. <br>  <br>  Instead, try rolling it on but leave an inch at the tip...in other words...at the head of his penis, there is still about an inch  of condom "hanging" there .  This will allow it to slide a little bit.  <br>  <br>  I would also suggest buying the lubricated condoms or buying some lubricant...Astroglide is very good.<br>  <br>  Dryness or putting them on wrong are the only reasons I can think of.  I've never had one break...but I have had them come off once or twice.|`|a1x5E47Zaa	Yes, he is putting on it wrong. There should not be any air left in it before putting on. De-air the tip with thumb and finger while holding it tight and then roll the condom down the erect penis.

Most likely, he's putting it on wrong or is poking a hole in it when he puts it on.  Some guys like to try that and later they come up with the excuse that condoms don't work for them and therefore they shouldn't use a condom.  But remember this, you can opt to put the condom on for him, or you will run the risk of getting pregnant.|`|a3c8cd4c001e0df1907a8fc54f76a93aaa	Another thing that can cause breakage is by using the wrong kind of lubricant.  Any kind of grease or oil will damage a latex condom and make it weaker.  So if he is using baby oil, or olive oil, or butter, or crisco, or petroleum jelly, then he is causing the condom to fail.<br>  <br>  If he wants to add a lubricant he should use a water, glycerine, or silicone lubricant made for sex.<br>  <br>  I agree with the recommendations to try leaving an inch of space at the top.  He should try different size condoms.  He should try putting a little lubricant on the inside of the condom, too.<br>  <br>  Storage could be a problem.  If the condoms are being stored someplace where they can get hot, the heat can ruin them.  He shouldn't carry one in his wallet, he shouldn't leave them in the car.  If the ones he has are old, he should buy fresh.

If you were that big you'd be hitting their Cervix (the place where soon to be born babies are stored) and I've heard many stories from female friends saying how unbearable that is. The female body can adapt to different sizes and take a lot of pain, but thats just doing too much...
AA12001920	Sorry hun, there's nothing you can do to make your nipples bigger.  You're stuck with what you have, just like all the rest of us women.  Some women are ok with their nipples, some think they're too big, and like you some think they're too small.  That's life.  Not very many people are 100% ok with the way their body is, but there's not much people can do other than plastic surgery to change things.<br>  <br>  As for when you're cold and they stand up, that's kind of like goosebumps.  When you're cold your skin pulls tight and closer to your body to keep any warmth inside.  This keeps your body's temperature normal and all your vital organs safe.  The technical term is "homeostasis".  It's your body's regulatory mechanism.  It makes your skin retract when cold and relax when warm.  It's what gives you goosebumps and makes you sweat.  There's no way to stop your nipples from getting hard when you're cold.  The best way to prevent other people from seeing it is to wear a bra with a little bit of padding and material.  Don't wear those paper thin ones!!  Body By Victoria at Victoria's Secret is my favorite, but they're a little bit pricey.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how old you are or if you're having sex, but your nipples can also get hard when you're sexually turned on without having goosebumps along with it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|eRyVH2wMaa	sorry there nothing u can do about that|`|qGK3cnXmaa	You can't change the size of your nipples. And when your are cold you know how your arms get goose bumps? well your nipples react by getting "hard"
AA11865147	You don't need 10.<br>  One or two will do the trick.<br>  1.  Focus on the other person.  It is NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.  <br>  2.  Cultivate gentleness and kindness.

For some people that might be rock climbing but for others it might be something as simple as starting a conversation with someone that they don't know!! Good luck!
e8UsGJUbaa	No. The ovaries are unaware of physical intercourse, they should not hurt you. It is possible that they hurt for another reason (ovulation, middleshmirtz, infection, tube pregnancy...) or that something else is hurting that you are attributing to the ovaries accidently. It is worth speaking with your GYN about any pain during intercourse.|`|oBEu3ePWaa	No, get to a doctor something could be seriously wrong. That exact thing happened to me and I ended up having something called Poly-cystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS. It's very painful during intercourse and for a little while after.

En los días previos a la ovulación, el estrógeno estimula al útero para que se recubra con sangre y tejidos adicionales, de modo que sus paredes se vuelven más gruesas y acolchadas. De esta manera, el útero se prepara para un embarazo. Si el óvulo llega al útero y es fertilizado por un espermatozoide, se adhiere a la pared acolchada del útero, para luego convertirse poco a poco en un bebé.<br>  <br>  Por el contrario, si el óvulo no es fertilizado -lo que ocurre en la mayoría de los ciclos mensuales de una joven-, no se adhiere a la pared del útero. Cuando esto sucede, el útero elimina el tejido adicional que recubre su interior. La sangre, el tejido y el óvulo sin fertilizar abandonan el útero y atraviesan la vagina para ser eliminados del cuerpo. En esto consiste el período menstrual. Este ciclo ocurre casi todos los meses durante varias décadas (salvo, por supuesto, cuando la mujer está embarazada) hasta que la mujer llega a la menopausia y sus ovarios ya no liberan óvulos|`|e6f0d027c1e86ac59574778d72ea3f16aa	fisiologicamente no pasa nada.... psicologicamnete es el cambio|`|eed70c9eff0e9ff39e1dc5c34af0c7f6aa	si es irregular, el tener sexo ayuda a controlar el ciclo...aunque a veces al principio lo desconotrola, por la liberacion de muchas hormonas, mas de lo normal...|`|3BNS2tcQaa	La rotura del himen.Que cada 28 día...te baja|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	El ciclo menstrual no tiene nada que ver con las relaciones sexuales.

Avoid touching your skin because you can bring unwanted bacteria. Also if you have long hair watch out that it doesn't fall on your skin.<br>  <br>  Eating chocolate doesn't cause pimples directly. If you have outbreaks after you eat chocolate that means your metabolism doesn't work as it should. You should eat more healthy food and drink lots of water. Also do you workout regularly? Workout is important to improve your blood circulation. It heps greatly for acne, also your body will flush toxins out faster.

This may be different in the case of rough play and anal sex due to a higher likely hood of micro abrasions - tears and blood....<br>  <br>  However this is not the same for HEP B , HEP A , HIV  and all the other STIs that exist - safer sex ( condoms) may be a better option for you than all these worries!<br>  <br>  HEP C can easily be transmitted in ways you are not considering such as sharing:<br>  <br>  injecting equipment (needles) <br>  nail scissors<br>  toothbrush<br>  razors<br>  tattooing<br>  piercing<br>  <br>  these methods of transmission are effective as they easily transfer blood from one person to another!<br>  <br>  hope this clears things up a bit<br>  <br>  PS: go get a test to be sure and remember that with viruses such as Hep C your GP may not be up to date with transmission methods and therefore may make you worry without reason  - don't believe the hype - get a test ;)<br>  <br>  if you want some confidential on line advice you can log on to this site <a href="http://www.counsellingonline.org.au/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.counsellingonline.org.au/en/</a> its a drug and alcohol site but they will be able to help you|`|Byro2o1gaa	Yes.........|`|YMMGtDEbaa	Yes.

If you want to continue to lose weight, you need to exercise more and change up your workout.  Make it a little harder.  Cardio is any aerobic exercise that works out your heart.  It will help you burn adipose tissue (body fat) and gradually speed up your metabolism.  Examples of cardio are running, bicycling, swimming, using an elliptical, etc.  Weight training is lifting weights to tone or build muscle.  Both are important if you want a good body.  Like I said, doing cardio will burn fat and weight training not only helps you tone your muscles but the more lean muscle you have, the easier it will be to burn the fat off and keep it off.  I suggest you do cardio before weight training.  You can get better results that way.<br>  <br>  Another good tip for you would be to eat carbs before you exercise.  It will give you energy to help you last longer in your workout.  Just be sure to give yourself enough time in between eating and starting your workout so you won't feel uncomfortable.  Also, drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.  Don't wait til you're thirsty because by then, you're actually already dehydrated.  Personally, when I workout and drink plenty of fluids I last longer and don't give up as easily.|`|9nElIoMiaa	Your body is used to what you are throwing at it. Mix it up.<br>  <br>  I do cardio for weight loss (bike and sometimes rowing) because it burns a whole lot more calories while you are doing it than heaving weights.  I do weights to build muscle mass.. which in turn burns more calories while I am resting during the process of repairing the muscles from lifting.<br>  <br>  If you want to be lean and all you are doing is lifting weights.. I don't think it will get you there.<br>  <br>  I like to do cardio after lifting. That is because I am pretty well exhausted after 45- 60 mins of high intensity interval training and couldn't lift anywhere near my max to save my life at that point. You need to lift to your max to induce muscle mass so I think it is better to do weight training before cardio or even better.... on a different day altogether. You do need to warm up before lifting.. do some light weight warm up sets first.|`|0c37d05b223f7905bcd6e3d618e904c3aa	You should be happy, if according to the chart your weight is perfect and remains constant, then what's better than that?|`|PZCOfGToaa	My field is in fashion, as a result many people ask me how they can slim down.

So keep up the workouts.  Cardio is more of a weight loss area to increase your heart rate, and burn fat.  Whereas weight training is to develop muscle which will result in muscular weight gain.  I usually do some cardion (i.e. running) before i lift, so that i can get my heart rate going to get the best out of my workout.   Hope this answers your questions
8af7c83c11e3ae1ebbe79e787307d555aa	Okay - I just want to say: ignore the first answerer. This is something you'll never "get over." It's not something you can just bounce back from, and the pain from losing a parent will always accompany you. The good news is, you're certainly not alone. There are a lot of people you can talk to who will understand and talk to you about it, and you probably have a lot of confusing emotions right now. When my dad left me (he didn't die, but he left and I haven't seen or heard from him in 4 years), I was angry, depressed, frustrated, apathetic...there were all sorts of things going through my head.<br>  Sometimes it takes talking to a lot of people to feel better. Sometimes just talking to one person and getting it off your chest will help you.<br>  Don't think that this will disappear with time though...it won't. But you'll learn how to cope with it and remember the good memories and love you had for your parent.<br>  Best wishes.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	well I lost my mom at 8 so I seriously doubt ur younger then that and I just recently lost my dad as well so get over it it happens to every one eventually okay|`|0KB0iRmaaa	sry 2 hear about dat. the only thing u really can do is think of something else and get ur mind off of it. well once again sry to hear about that.|`|3kZ5fwINaa	Hey there. I know it can be so tough. When I was around 6 my mom left for good..true she's not actually dead but close enough for me. Its hard and its a struggle and being at a young age makes it all worse. Just think, their probably in a much better and nicer place now. A place where they dont have to worry about bills or jobs, or their kids. Like I said, I know its tough but be strong and good for them. Help their legacy live in through you because part of them is still alive in you. I hope this helps hon. In the meantime, just try listeing to some songs and going on walks in the evening.  The setting sun and the fresh air might help. Also maybe try writing down how you feel - it helps. And if you want soemone to talk to, feel free to email me any time. <br>  Take care :)<br>  ~Tyanna Lynae~|`|BjWL82GCaa	I do not know how old are you as you mentioned that you are young.  The other is how you lost your parents.<br>  <br>  If you could elaborate a bit more about your parents and your age, perhaps I might be able to provide certain views to help you out.|`|WdjqDnztaa	you need the right tools to cope with this extraordinarily difficult situation.<br>  we don't necessarily receive these tools, for coping with loss and grief, as children, so we need to seek help from someone who can teach us these tools.<br>  If people don't seek to receive effective and healthy tools they often pick up tools on their own, tools that are easier to use, but detrimental, such as denial, depression, anxiety, drugs and alcohol, anger, withdrawal, etc.<br>  Get some help so that you don't spend the rest of your youth wasting your time and ruining your life trying to make something better with warped tools.

Also jump rope and get a punching bag (it really works) Do anything you enjoy that can make you sweaty. Have fun.|`|LfgniR2eaa	Losing weight, and fast, is a very difficult thing to accomplish, I know from personal experience. But being 5'9", 120 pounds is kind of too skinny. But, a work out plan is not the case exactly, exercise is only 20% of what you need to lose weight. You must eat less and healthier. The best diet plan is to eat 6 small meals a day. A whole meal could be just an apple, because since you're eating 6 times a day, you don't need to eat as big of meals. But make sure you eat ton of protein! Salmon and chicken are very good sources of protein, as are bananas, but just eating veggies and fruits is not healthy. Running is good, but it's only a cardio work out. Try sit-ups for your core, jumping rope, and maybe some leg lifts and push-ups for your arms and legs. If you eat right and still exercise, there will absolutely be a result in your weight.

vwBo50Ywaa	alright. first of all if you eat 1400 calories right after a juice fast (or any fast) then you will gain the weight u lost from fasting back!!! and maybe plus some to!!!<br>  so don't do that. it won't work. (you can research it). there are methods of coming out of fasts that include careful reintroductions of solid foods.<br>  so based on this - you wouldn't loose a thing. actually you would be lucky not to gain anything.<br>  <br>  the running part is excellent though (and even if you run, you will still gain if you eat 1400 calories after a fast!)<br>  i would try (instead) if you are that desperate - shifting the amount of calories you consume per day. for example: if you want to average at 1300 cals per day, then in a 4 day period you would eat; Day 1: 1000 calories, Day 2: 1200 cals, Day 3: 1400 cals, Day 4: 1600 calories then go back to Day 1.<br>  you can fiddle around with the numbers but thats the basic idea.<br>  good luck!|`|AA10585364	i wouldn't decrease the amount of calories you intake, just keep it at the normal amount a person like you should consume in a day (my guess if your a male is around 2000 calories) and exercise so you won't have a slower metabolism.|`|dHJMWm92aa	Not sure be careful..it is never healthy to diet this way... and most likely you will gain it back..u should just see a nutritionist or trainner.Lower ur cal intake and work out as much as you can...Burn more calories than u eat and keep this healthy diet.Fruits,veggies...low carb intake...protiens.|`|e44b88788892714848892d7f49b7bfb6aa	you will probably lose about 10 lbs in that amount of time.  assume you will lose an average of 2 lbs a week, with a larger weight loss right in the beginning

Or one of your testicles at least , Trust me its coming from a survivor of this. I had to have my testicles stiched back on so they dont hang as low as they used to. Just let yourself go when it is time and stop jerking off so much.|`|dOpKsNYcaa	There is nothing wrong with the stop and go technique. Ejaculation is good for the prostate and when its interrupted/delayed or prevented it can be painful or in some cases perhaps damage the prostate, but that is extremely rare and as long as you are not abusing this technique I can't see it doing any permanent harm. Doctors usually say that "blue balls" is only a temporary and harmless thing and this sounds very related to that, so you are probably okay. But if you force yourself to use this technique all the time, you might have problems in the future with erectile disfunction. I would talk to a urologist for more precise information.|`|eRyVH2wMaa	I dont think thats true|`|ddnI304Naa	No, it's not bad. Your body reabsorps the semen. <br>  I'm not sure if the prostate 'contracts'. It's not a muscle. How can it contract?<br>  When you ejaculate it's your kegel muscle that contracts. That's the same muscle that contracts when you pee.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just a thought:<br>  If you learn how to control your kegel muscle, you'd be able to control your ejaculation, and achieve multiple orgasm. Your technique would become "Go without stopping".|`|g6XdhfiXaa	thats all rubish. do whatever feels awsome. try 'stop and go' and right before you ***, ice your balls, then repeat this 10 times or so.

And not all drugs have the same effect on all people; Prozac seems to actually have helped some folks I've known!<br>  If someone feels they are "out of control", then by all means consider professional help!  But I would also like to encourage you to seek out a "Christian" counselor or psychiatrist!  Yes they do exist!  My struggle or "need" for the drugs is gone now completely!  But it is because I have grown in faith and prayer to the point I now know exactly where to go for help!  Fanatic; "YES" ; when it comes to seeking God's help or sharing it, I am indeed a fanatic!  Do I still have the "ups and downs" again yes!  But they aren't life threatening!  And yes I have actually attempted suicide many years ago!  God has protected me from myself a few times!<br>  I am now in the midst of continuing to take classes in Christian counseling so God can use me to be more useful in Blessing people as I  ever was in being harmful to them as I once was!  I thank God daily for HIs love and massive mercy.  I pray this site doesn't consider this spam!  I have indeed taken "Pastoral Counseling" classes at Liberty University's Bible Institute, but even more useful and effective are the lessons and experience God has shared and allowed me to experience.  I am almost 50 so I've had a couple of "Been there and done that" experiences!  May this Bless you!  In Jesus Name I ask!|`|AA11387869	Not when you think about the fact that there are so many medications to choose from, in keeping it under control.  Of course, doctors need to experiment, to see which one--and which dose works best for you.|`|89X41WLRaa	It's only as scary as it has been up until this point.  You've been living with it this whole time, so knowing what it is should not make it scarier.  Now you can get the proper treatment and you won't need a temporary drug induced coma because you'll find the right combination of medications and then have to adjust to what "normal" is like.|`|4Mu9M1xUaa	if youve had to live with it your entire life already, then changing to normal will be what seems strange. you're not crazy, i have felt the same way.  ask your doctor about drugs like lithium and seroquel. good luck!|`|5YcNCzrfaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I am sorry but those are not normal feelings.  At least having a diagnosis now gives you a place to start to get as well as you can.  That's a good thing.<br>  <br>  I have had thoughts of ending my life, but I actually tried a few times, that is not normal.  Wanting to be put into a month long coma again is not normal.  Seems like you want to avoid something big time.  <br>  <br>  Sure, we all have bad days but when you are cycling then your bad days can be so much worse than bad.<br>  <br>  I also have Bipolar and a few other diagnoses, if you need to talk or any other reason, my contact info is in my profile.

It can be scary getting a diagnosis or a relief that now you have a name for what is wrong and can get the right treatment.  Normies don't have these feelings 2-3 times a week, but it is normal for untreated bipolar disorder.  Perhaps you will not be so scared if you learn more.

For the past five years I have been on and off medications, seen a couple of doctors.  Right now I am on Seroquel.  So will see what happens.  I asked that same question to my last doctor, about being normal.  What exactly is normal??  Who knows.  I never know how I am going to feel from day to day.  See someone to get some help.  It will certainly not hurt!
GD8nyI7Taa	Although it is normal for some women to have very bad menstrual pain / dysmenorrhea, often many sort of grow out of it as they get older.  It is a little suprising that it has lasted a decade, though that doesn't necessarily mean that something is wrong with you.  If you have never been to an OBGYN, you may want to anyways, just get that ball rolling, so to speak, since you are 22 now.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you keep using the topical heat, and instead of tylenol, try and NSAID (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug) like ibuprofen or naproxen (Aleve).  The NSAIDs work a little better for menstrual pain, as long as you don't have any reasons for not taking them (e.g. allergies or stomach ulcers, etc.).  If you know when you are going to get your period, you can try to start taking it about a day before it starts, too, to ward of the pain before it begins.  Take the pain med every 4-6 hours around the clock (just don't go over the max. dose recommended on the bottle).<br>  <br>  I would probably still make an appointment with your doctor, for peace of mind.  Most likely you are fine, but this way, you will know for sure.  Also, there are prescription-strength NSAIDs that are sometimes used, or sometimes doctors will put you on the birth control pill to regulate your period, because that wil actually make it lighter and often less painful.  These other options might also be helpful to you.|`|0d96WXZhaa	I used to have the same problem, my Doctor put me on birth control to reduce the pain and it helped, but I still take Midol-- I think it works the best. You might have endometriosis, your Doctor can do a test to check it can be harmful to your body if it goes untreated|`|aapFvNg3aa	i think it's normal, but see a doctor, just in case|`|zDJWpH6Raa	You might be okay.  I didn't get cramps much until maybe having my period for 9 or 10 years too...and when I started to, BOY did they HURT!!

y8m7aqw7aa	It depends on your age, aswell. But you are overweight considering  your height and weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are alot of easy ways to get in shape- there's clubs, gyms, dieting, cutting back on calories and most importantly  physical activity. All of these are there to help you. <br>  Start setting goals for yourself. ( example : this month I'm going to try and loose 10 pounds ) It keeps you motivated.<br>   <br>  Eating healthy is also key on loosing weight- eat a variety of foods from different food groups. Fruit, veggies, meat and proteins, and dairy. Organic is great. Avoid foods with hydrogenated oil, trans fat or saturated fat. You can tell which foods have these by reading the tiny print list of ingredients on the side of the package.  No fast food! <br>  <br>  I find that swimming is great way to get in shape or stay fit. Its easy on your joints (unlike running or weight-lifting, although doing some of that is good for you too) and you use almost all of the muscles in your body. Remember to stretch afterward!<br>  <br>   Try it out sometime.|`|M66LSAZBaa	what a stud|`|8fe951010b9723d3ceb80550815af3faaa	Yes you are very over weight you need to lose at least15 stone to be a healthy weight|`|69035383383abe9587bfe12abdf7286daa	oh my........o_O.....GOD! ur.uhh.......u seriously need to lose something|`|981df12e3af5a0a9a808ef0ad9c7d9cbaa	dude i seriously hope that's a typo, becuase you should be like 120-130 pounds.

SpL9XYVQaa	I wouldn't WANT a doctor who works on line.  I want a doctor to know my medical history, to listen to my symptoms, and then check for himself or herself.   I don't want my doctor to JUST take my word for it, I want that to just be a starting point and have the doc find the empirical data to either support or disclaim what I've said.  <br>  <br>  That's how misdiagnoses occur -- I'm not a doc, I don't play one on TV, so I want a real, flesh and blood doctor to CHECK on what I've said, not just agree with me and write me a prescription.
b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	Fruit flies eat and breed in moist, organic materials. This means fruits and vegetables (especially when over ripe or rotting), dirty sponges and wash-cloths, juices, spills and messes. If your infestation is typical, they are centering around your kitchen, so that’s where we’ll start.<br>  <br>  Kitchens:<br>  1.  Remove standing liquids and any soft materials or fabrics that are wet. <br>  <br>  2.  Flush your drains and garbage disposals with ammonia or drain cleaners. Do this once every few hours for a while or partially plug the drain and fill the sink so the cleaners trickle down slowly and stay present in the pipes. <br>  <br>  3.  Empty your trash before it overflows and invest in trash containers with tight-fitting lids, make sure they close securely. <br>  <br>  4.  Check your dishwasher for grime collecting in the bottom and the filter. Refrain from storing dirty dishes in there until you’ve eliminated the incursion. <br>  <br>  5. Scour your cabinets and pantries for exposed and forgotten foods - sacks of potatoes are common culprits, so are bags of grains and legumes that have become moist (These will breed moths as well). Store fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge until the fruit flies are eradicated. <br>  <br>  6. Check under your refrigerator and other movable appliances and furniture for hidden spills and messes. <br>  <br>  7. If you have an electric stove, lift up the burners as well as the entire top surface and check for spills inside. <br>  <br>  8. Dry the surfaces in the sink when you are not using it. <br>  <br>  9. Relocate any potted plants or herbs outside (if the weather allows) and / or apply an insecticide that is safe to use on houseplants and edibles. <br>  <br>  10. Clean underneath your sink, look for leaks and soft, moist or rotting wood <br>  <br>  11.  Dispose of or clean old towels and sponges. <br>  <br>  12. Use your nose! Sniff around for anything rotten or out of place. <br>  13.  Check the cracks between your kitchen appliances and the cabinets for anything that may have fallen between them.|`|PE7fRmFuaa	Definetely wash your fruit with water as SOON as you buy them in case there are fly eggs on them. Also I'd recommend covering the fruit with plastic wrap. Fruit flies breed in moist places, especially around/under garbage, recycling bins, composts, etc. So change those FREQUENTLY and clean up spills ASAP. Even wet lint under the washing machine is an ideal place for fruit fly breeding.<br>  <br>  Some people put out small bowls of cidar vinegar and add a bit of dish soap to them. If you put it in a high place and out of reach from the children, the flies could still access it and hopefully that'd do the trick!|`|SpL9XYVQaa	I know this sounds really stupid, but wine.  You pour out a small glass of wine and let it sit on the counter.  With children, you just push it far back on the counter.  I've seen it work -- the fruit flies go in and drown.  It cuts down on them but doesn't get rid of them totally.

They should really be used when you are trying to make certain gains that are harder to reach and you need help getting there.<br>  <br>  If you are getting enough grams of protein (say, 1g of protein for each pound of lean body mass) then you definitely don't need a protein shake.  If your diet is deficient in protein, then you can supplement your dient with some protein.<br>  <br>  But you can just buy a big canister of Designer Whey Protein or something like that, and mix it with water and chug it down.  That's just as good as a $5 shake at the gym.  Better, probably, because a lot of times they sugar up the shakes at the gym.|`|0m2DDfv4aa	eat soy :)|`|bb3lH4Z4aa	eat alot of, fish, chicken, egg whites, ect...just high protine.... ths shake helps add in alot of protine at one time...you can get up 80+ grams of protine in one shake, you get about 36 from a chicken breast...depending on if your serious about a protine diet or not... <br>  <br>  <br>  Eat AFTER you lift...about 20-30 min after

Do not rely on symptoms, as symptoms of pregnancy are often at times ALSO symptoms of other things and problems. May it be major or minor, you could be getting 100 different symptoms of being pregnant and something completely different could be happening to your body. In order to conceive pregnant sperm must enter the vagina, pool in the cervix, join with an "egg" and attach to the uterus creating an embryo. This seems like such a long drawn out process and the little "swimmer" has such a long way to go, foreplay and other sexual encounters shouldn't be able to get a women pregnant, right? Wrong! It is possible to conceive during many different acts, not just vaginal sexual intercourse. Did you know if a man ejaculates into a woman's anus, those little "swimmers" can actually "SWIM" out of the anus, into the vagina, pool in the cervix, attach to an "egg" that attaches to the uterine wall creating an embryo and conceive a pregnancy! A woman can become pregnant through foreplay, anal intercourse, or as I said before, at any point where it is even *possible* sperm/semen [this includes precum] could have gotten in, on or near the vagina. Contraceptive [such as "the pill", condoms, spermicide, IUD's ect.] are NOT, are NEVER 100% fail-proof.<br>  <br>  If your period is irregular [even if it is common for your period to be irregular] and there is a chance you may be pregnant, take a HPT [home pregnancy test]. If it shows negative, try another a few days later. If you continue to receive negative HPT's but you still *appear* to be pregnant, see your local OB/GYN or family practitioner, receive a blood test to confirm the negative pregnancy. If you receive a negative blood test [which are also not full proof!] but are still concerned that you may be pregnant, receive an ultrasound. This will show whether or not there is an embryo attached in the uterus. If no embryo shows there may be something wrong and your doctor can further diagnose you.<br>  <br>  If a HPT, blood test or ultrasound confirm pregnancy, find an OB/GYN immediately! It is important to keep an tabs on everything going on in your pregnancy from step one, even if you plan on abortion or adoption.<br>  <br>  If you have decided to become sexually active but are not TTC [trying to conceive] please be responsible and use proper birth control. If you do not have the money to purchase birth control visit your local Free Clinic. There are Free Clinics in every area and will provide you with proper care. <br>  <br>  If you are underage and afraid to look to a parent or guardian, visits to Free Clinics and your OB/GYN *ARE* completely 100% confidential, although I would advise looking to at least one influential adult in your life, this would create a support system where you could obtain knowledge, ask other questions, and discuss personal things with.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

SpL9XYVQaa	Hormones can TRIGGER seizures, but I have NEVER heard (in the 34 years I have had epilepsy) of epilepsy being CAUSED by seizures.  I have had catamenial seizures for all of those 34 years -- in fact, my first period and first seizure were within 2 weeks of each other!  You might want to read the article below, which is a posting of the article that was in Epilepsy USA in December 2006.<br>  <br>  As far as progesterone, the best controlled my seizures ever were (before my brain surgery 6 months ago) was when I was on progesterone to try to prevent miscarriages.|`|9eba708d49a4d6e5bb7dcdd7f39af58daa	Well, I had my first seizure (i wasn't pregnant) but guess what?!  hormones cause epilepsy!!!  Would you have ever have thought it???  trust me, i wouldn't have!!!  i had it when i was on my period...my first seizure, at 13.  they said most  women do develop epilepsy during pregnancy and 1 in 3 women that do get pregnant will have epileptic seizures while pregnant, but once they give birth about 6 months later the brain waves will maintain normalcy.  Trust me here, i know i wasn't pregnant when it happened, but i know all about epilepsy!!  Yours should dissappear completely soon, and even if it doesn't you shouldn't continue having any more seizures, okay???<br>  <br>  don't worry, you will be fine, and i hope for a great delivery!!
X05Jiim4aa	My three year old had swollen lymph nodes in his neck.  They would flare up and then get better.  Our ped put him on strong antibiotics (more than one round) and they finally got smaller and softer.  Her next step was going to be referring us to an ENT to surgically drain them.  I know of a guy that had and enormous swollen lymph node, literally the size of a med-large lemon and he had to have it drained.<br>  <br>  My sister is a nurse and thought that my son's were due to allergies.  She and her son have trouble with allergens and their lymph nodes will swell during bad allergy flare ups.  It makes sense.  Your lymph system is a cleansing part of the body so when they are trying to clean things out, even allergens, I could see why they'd be swollen.  If you think it might be an allergy problem, try some allergy meds.  If that's not it, and it truly is nothing, then you might just have to wait and see if they get better or worse.  If they get worse, I'd push your doctor to find out why.
6GX2SHo3aa	yea, its normal for it to leak a little. try putting a pad on to. thats what i do and i am fine. you shouldn't feel anything though, and maybe you are putting it in wrong. or try a different brand, because if it isn't in right, then you will feel it, and that is probably why it is leaking a bit. try putting it in farther too.|`|OgJTDJIoaa	YEA U SHOULDNT FEEL IT IF U DONT U NEED PUSH IT UP MORE|`|X05Jiim4aa	If the tampon is inserted correctly, and it's not too large for  your frame (I know a woman had difficulty with tampons and had to start with the smallest available and work up) then you should not be uncomfortable sitting, standing, walking, doing anything.  If you have a heavy flow or don't replace it often enough it could leak.  Just be sure to get the right size for how heavy your flow is and change it often.
AA10395708	Generally, long line bras are strapless so it might be for sundress, etc.  Also, line longs are used to hold in rolls or excess fat around the midrib area.  I would be asking myself if I am too fat around my ribs or if my bra straps are showing if my mother told me that.|`|X05Jiim4aa	Corsets are generally used to make you look smaller, either your bust and/or you upper abdomen area.  There are plenty of well made bras with good support that are just regular bras.  Modesty would be the clothing you wear over your bra.
DsE2A1XQaa	I suggest go ahead give your body a little shock...Or unless your body just can't handle it at this point..If not start out with some basic walking or light aerobics or something..From my experience I think as long as you get about 30 minutes of some sort of physical exercise at least 3-4 times a week, you should definitely be on your way to getting fit..This will help burn off calories and fat..Then you can start doing some toning exercises that will define or give your body shape. Definitely remember to not overload yourself or put unrealistic expectations on yourself cuz most the time when people do, they tend to fall short then give up completely. Do something you enjoy and make it a part of your daily life, it will be much simpler and more enjoyable for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|AA10640379	Start by walking. Outside or treadmill. It doesn't matter.<br>  Get comfortable with that, then start light weight training. <br>  Just the basics.|`|ZWJlcm1Vaa	Well, start by eating right and getting the appropriate balance of nutrition. Be sure to also drink plenty of water. If you eat junk food, working out will not make your body feel it's best. Exercising on a balanced diet is much more efficient. I would start by taking long walks at night. Before or after dinner every night, walk about 1-1 1/2 miles. Build up every other week by power walking, jogging and then to running. Change your distances to your comfortability will suit you best. Then you can ease into muscle building and lifting weights. You will gradually get into shape and it will not shock your body. This plan will most definitely work best.
2d8db0ccb0430e88d5d758ecbc0588e0aa	L'Asino (Equus asinus domesticus) veniva impiegato dall'uomo per il tiro, per la sella e soprattutto per il basto. Animale molto rustico, presenta un carattere docile, paziente e riservato, ed è capace di provare affetto per coloro che lo trattano in modo conveniente, sapendo riconoscere il padrone anche da molto lontano. Un tempo molto diffuso in Italia, è andato via via scomparendo a causa della crescente meccanizzazione dei lavori in campagna. Negli ultimi anni è oggetto di crescente interesse, a causa dell'onoterapia (pratica che utilizza l’asino come strumento terapeutico per rimettere in moto i sentimenti e il piacere della comunicazione emotiva) e della riscoperta del latte di asina, prezioso alimento dalle caratteristiche organolettiche molto vicine al latte materno e quindi molto indicato per i bambini con allergie alimentari. <br>  <br>  Le informazioni riportate sul sito www.agraria.org sono state inserite con grande attenzione, ma non si escludono possibili errori (che vi preghiamo gentilmente di segnalarci).

In 2006, the Cochrane Collaboration published a systematic review of randomized controlled trials in order to evaluate the effect of preventative removal of asymptomatic wisdom teeth[4]. The authors found no evidence to either support or refute this practice. However, there was reliable evidence showing that preventative removal did not reduce or prevent late incisor crowding. The authors of the review suggested that the number of surgical procedures could be reduced by 60% or more.<br>  <br>  Likewise, ClinicalEvidence published a summary [5], largely based on the Cochrane review, that concluded prophylactic extraction is "Likely to be ineffective or harmful". ClinicalEvidence offered the following details:<br>  <br>  'While it is clear that symptomatic impacted wisdom teeth should be surgically removed, it appears that extracting asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth is not advisable due to the risk of damage to the inferior alveolar nerve.'<br>  'Some non-RCT evidence suggests that extraction of the asymptomatic tooth may be beneficial if caries are present in the adjacent second molar, or if periodontal pockets are present distal to the second molar.'"|`|L6IeZoqZaa	no, not everyone.

wJfh9QmPaa	HéRNIA HIATAL<br>  Hérnia Hiatal é uma das condi??es mal interpretadas e acusadas equivocadamente. Muitas pessoas queixam-se de sua hérnia como responsável por muitos sintomas que n?o s?o provocados pela hérnia. Pacientes com hérnia precisam entender o que é e como pode ocorrer. As pessoas com hérnia hiatal necessitam saber ser este um problema freqüente com necessidade de orienta??o médica adequada.<br>  <br>  ANATOMIA<br>  O diafragma é uma capa muscular separando o tórax do abdome, Quando a pessoa respira profundamente o diafragma que é em forma de uma cúpula, contrai-se, tornando-se plano. Assim o diafragma puxa o ar para dentro do pulm?o. à esquerda do diafragma contém um pequeno orifício pelo qual passa o es?fago. Normalmente este orifício é pequeno e o es?fago está fixado nele por vários ligamentos. O est?mago situa-se abaixo do diafragma.<br>  <br>  QUAL é A CAUSA DA HéRNIA HIATAL?<br>  Em algumas pessoas, o hiato ou orifício do diafragma enfraquece e aumenta seu diametro. N?o é conhecido porque isto ocorre. Pode ser devido à hereditariedade, obesidade, exercícios como levantamento de peso, ou muito esfor?o para evacuar. Independente da causa, uma por??o do est?mago hernia ou move-se para cima, para dentro da cavidade torácica através do orifício dilatado. Uma hérnia hiatal é agora presente. As hérnias hiatais s?o muito freqüentes, ocorrendo em torno de 60% das pessoas com mais de 60 anos.<br>  <br>  QUAIS S?O OS TIPOS DE HéRNIA HIATAL?<br>  1- Hérnia de Deslizamento - é o tipo mais comum de hérnia hiatal, a por??o herniada do est?mago desliza para cima do diafragma. Estas hérnias normalmente s?o pequenas e usualmente n?o causam problemas ou sintomas.<br>  <br>  2- Hérnia Hiatal Fixa - Neste caso a parte superior do est?mago está fixada no tórax. Mesmo com esta hérnia pode haver poucos sintomas. Entretanto, o potencial de problemas no es?fago é aumentado.<br>  <br>  3- Hérnia Hiatal Complicada - Felizmente este tipo de hérnia é incomum. Inclui uma variedade de hernia??o do est?mago, o est?mago aloja-se totalmente no tórax. Há uma alta probabilidade que problemas médicos ocorrem e o tratamento freqüentemente envolve cirurgia.<br>  <br>  SINTOMAS<br>  Em muitos pacientes, a hérnia hiatal n?o causa sintomas, isto é especialmente verdadeiro para as hérnias de desligamento. Quando os sintomas ocorrem, pode ser a azia e/ou regurgita??o, quando há refluxo ácido do est?mago para dentro do es?fago. Alguns pacientes com hérnia hiatal fixa têm cr?nico refluxo ácido para o es?fago podendo causar dano e mesmo hemorragia. A anemia, ou baixa contagem de células no exame de sangue pode acontecer numa fase posterior à inflama??o cr?nica na parte inferior do es?fago, pode produzir uma cicatriza??o e um estreitamento dessa área. Nesta fase a degluti??o é difícil pela obstru??o da passagem do alimento.<br>  HéRNIA HIATAL CAUSA DOR E INDIGEST?O?<br>  é equivocado acusar a hérnia hiatal de dor e indigest?o. A hérnia hiatal geralmente n?o causa dor aguda. Este sintoma pode resultar de outra desordem, como úlcera péptica ou doen?as cardíacas. Alguns pacientes com dor das coronárias(cora??o) acreditam ser a causa do desconforto, a presen?a da hérnia hiatal já diagnosticada. Quando há dor na parte superior do abdome ou mesmo indigest?o, a pessoa n?o deve enganar-se e atribuir sua queixa a uma hérnia hiatal, ao contrário, o paciente deve fazer uma consulta.<br>  <br>  DIAGNóSTICO<br>  O diagnóstico de uma hérnia hiatal pode ser feito por um Raio X constratado de es?fago e pela endoscopia.<br>  <br>  QUAIS S?O AS COMPLICA??ES?<br>  Azia cr?nica e inflama??o na parte inferior do es?fago, chamada esofagite de refluxo; anemia devido à hemorragia cr?nica na por??o inferior do es?fago; cicatriza??o e estreitamento da parte inferior do es?fago causando dificuldade na degluti??o; enquanto dormindo, secre??o gástrica pode refluir para o es?fago e para dentro do pulm?o causando tosse cr?nica, asma bronquica, ou mesmo pneumonia.<br>  <br>  TRATAMENTO<br>  O tratamento é necessário quando a azia for constante ou dificuldade de degluti??o. A esofagite e a ulcera??o da parte inferior o es?fago também necessitam de tratamento. O tratamento pode ser clínico ou dependendo da situa??o a op??o cirúrgica é preferível.<br>  <br>  MEDIDAS GERAIS<br>  1- Comer menos e distribuir alimenta??o ao longo do dia;<br>  <br>  2- Evitar comer ou beber 2 horas antes de ir dormir;<br>  <br>  3- Eliminar fatores que aumentam a press?o intra-abdominal: cintas e roupas apertadas, ou mesmo exercícios abdominais;<br>  <br>  4- Se for obeso, perder peso, a obesidade causa refluxo;<br>  <br>  5- Eliminar ou reduzir significativamente cigarros, álcool, alimentos gordurosos, café e chocolate/<br>  <br>  6- Elevar a cabeceira da cama em mais ou menos 15 graus, para gravidade ajudar a evitar o refluxo gastresofágico durante o sono;<br>  <br>  OUTROS TRATAMENTOS<br>  Drogas: Alguns comprimidos reduzem a secre??o ácida do est?mago, enquanto outros aumentam a for?a da parte inferior do es?fago, reduzindo o refluxo ácido.<br>  Cirurgia: A mera presen?a da hérnia hiatal n?o é raz?o para cirurgia, mas a presen?a de esofagite, phmetria com parametros alterados, e a ineficiência medicamentosa.<br>  <br>  RESUMO<br>  A hérnia hiatal é extremamente comum e nem sempre causa sintomas ou problemas. Entretanto, quando há problemas pode ser tratado efetivamente com medicamentos ou mesmo com cirurgia.|`|e2bb10e6ce9fcc6df1df2046ffe82a9aaa	Caraca Bruna  a Nanah te respondeu absolutamente tudooooooo<br>  Parabéns Nanah fiquei de boca aberta<br>  Sabe Bruna eu tenho esofogite acompanhada de uma hérnia hietal e′la n?o me incomoda em nada <br>  agora tudo o que deve ser feito a Nanah ja descreveu pra vc<br>  <br>  <br>  bj linda ?|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	oi, Hernia no Esofago e uma má forma??o, ou o surgimento de disfun??o da valvula cardia. mas cada caso e um caso, para saber melhor voce tem que procurar um medico gastro..., e fazer os exames especificos.|`|Gzm8M67Aaa	O NOME MAIS EXATO DESTE PROBLEMA é HéRNIA DO HIATO. <br>  ANATOMICAMENTE FALANDO, ESTAMOS FALANDO DO DIAFRAGMA QUE SE SITUA LOGO ABAIXO DO ESTOMAGO. <br>  <br>  EM ALGUMAS PESSOAS, O HIATO OU ORIFICIO DO DIAFRAGMA ENFRAQUECE OU AUMENTA SEU DI?METRO. <br>  PODE SER DEVIDO A HEREDITARIEDADE, OBESIDADE, EXERCíCIOS COM LEVANTAMENTO DE PESO OU MUITO ESFOR?O PARA EVACUAR. <br>  <br>  INDEPENDENTE DA CAUSA, UMA POR??O DO EST?MAGO MOVE-SE PARA CIMA, PARA DENTRO DA CAVIDADE TORáCICA ATRAVéS DO ORIFICIO DILATADO GERANDO OS SINTOMAS DESCONFORTáVEIS. <br>  UM TRATAMENTO EFICAZ CHAMA-SE REFLEXOTERAPIA ANALíTICA E FISIOLóGICA E N?O NECESSITA DE REMéDIOS.|`|f6QnFOnzaa	Siga as orienta??es médicas, se n?o as tem procure um especialista.|`|gRpSwNTYaa	O es?fago é a por??o do tubo digestivo que conecta a garganta (faringe) ao est?mago. As paredes do es?fago impulsionam o alimento até o interior do est?mago com ondas rítmicas de contra??es musculares denominadas peristaltismo. Próximo à jun??o da garganta com o es?fago, existe uma faixa muscular denominada esfíncter esofágico superior. Logo acima da jun??o do es?fago com o est?mago, existe uma outra faixa muscular denominada esfíncter esofágico inferior. Quando o es?fago está em repouso, esses esfíncteres contraem e impedem o refluxo de alimento e de ácido gástrico do est?mago para a boca. Durante a degluti??o, os esfíncteres relaxam e, conseqüentemente, o alimento pode passar para o interior do est?mago.<br>  <br>  Dois dos sintomas mais comuns dos distúrbios esofágicos s?o a disfagia (sensa??o de dificuldade de degluti??o) e a dor torácica ou nas costas. A disfagia é a sensa??o de que o alimento n?o progride normalmente da garganta até o est?mago ou que ele está retido no meio do caminho. A sensa??o pode ser dolorosa (odinofagia). O movimento dos líquidos e sólidos podem, na realidade, ser impedido por anormalidades físicas da garganta, do es?fago e dos órg?os vizinhos ou por problemas do sistema nervoso ou musculares. A dificuldade de degluti??o também pode ser fruto da imagina??o.<br>  <br>  A dor torácica ou nas costas inclui a azia, a dor durante a degluti??o e a dor muscular esofágica.<br>  <br>  A dor durante a degluti??o pode ser decorrente de qualquer um dos problemas a seguir:<br>  <br>  Destrui??o do revestimento esofágico (mucosa), que pode ser resultante da inflama??o causada pelo refluxo gastroesofágico do est?mago<br>  Infec??es bacterianas, virais ou fúngicas da garganta<br>  Tumores, substancias químicas ou distúrbios musculares, como a acalasia e o espasmo difuso do es?fago.<br>  A dor pode ser percebida como uma sensa??o de queima??o ou como um aperto sob o esterno, que ocorre tipicamente logo após o indivíduo deglutir alimento ou líquido. A dor torácica constritiva e intensa que ocorre com a dificuldade de deglutir líquidos quentes ou frios é um sintoma típico dos distúrbios musculares esofágicos. As dores musculares esofágicas podem ser difíceis de serem diferenciadas da dor torácica devido a uma cardiopatia (angina). As dores ocorrem quando os músculos esofágicos entram em espasmo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msd-brazil.com/msdbrazil/patients/manual_Merck/mm_sec9_101.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.msd-brazil.com/msdbrazil/pati...</a>
LqGqWwqgaa	you probably have a very strong immune system and wash your hands a lot. good job!
9WIbZUH0aa	There's a state that some people get in when they wake up (and I can't remember what it's called, but i saw it on discovery channel) where part of their brain is still in sleep mode.  This is normally associated with a temporary feeling of paralysis, because, for most, the brain shuts down the body movements during sleep.  But, if you're a thrasher or a sleep walker, you could act out the rest of your dream while in this state, and be totally aware of what you're doing but not be able to control your body.      Some people also visualize their dream, and if they don't move, go back to sleep.  This is how many people people become convinced that they were abducted by aliens: they wake up, see a light and little green men, can't move, and then fall back asleep only to dream that they are being levitated out of their beds and then into a spaceship, where crude experiments are performed on them and alien children are placed in their stomachs (then they go on for years waiting for it to pop out.  Ew.)    Yeah, anyways, it's nothing to worry about.  You probably just had that thing happen to you.  Your mind is not being controlled, and you weren't sleep walking.  :D (tis a very common thing, actually....)
DCwGQDO9aa	You were in a strong state of REM.    When you sleep walk you don't remember, you were just dazed.    I wouldn't suggest anything to take to help you sleep, this could result in yourself falling into such a deep sleep that you do begin to display weird behavior.    Make sure that your parents know what happened, and take extra measures to be more alert.  Are you getting the right amount of rest (8 hrs.), maybe your just getting to tired and falling to sleep to quick because of being tired.|`|v640njQNaa	It is not a weird thing. It happens to a lot of people. What's actually happening is that your brain's neurons are sending signals to its neurotransmitters which basically put all the main events of your day from your memory in chronological order. Then at night, these events are repeated by you in a slightly different way. It is your hypothalamus that allows you to do this. I studied this in grade 7, so don't worry.|`|rtIS8mdtaa	wow! this has kinda happened to me, when i was about 10 i used to get up (sleepwalking) to get a drink of water. but eventually it stopped! I dont really know any info though, sorry
PlEEZTRsaa	Sounds like a urinary tract infection,see your doctor asap.|`|K4zsztkRaa	It's called an infection and you need to go to the doctor. If you have a UTI (urinary tract infection) that keeps comming back it can spread to your bladder and then your kidneys and become life threatening.  I would go to the hospital and get it looked at. Buring while urinating is never a good sign.    -Connor|`|jlfxJCLdaa	it may just be that you have some soap in the tip of you penis|`|r28rZWqLaa	It is probably a UTI (urinary tract infection).  If you are sexually active, which I hope you are not at 13, it could be an STD (sexually transmitted disease).  You probably should see your doctor.  There are other rare possibilities, but you should definitely see a doctor.|`|MHj1lFgOaa	Tell your parents, you need to see an Urologist it looks like an Urinary Tract Infection, it wont go away just by squeezing it.|`|OlLPLriHaa	I'm 13 as well and I had that happen to me.  It's some kind of infection.  Go to your doctor and he'll give you a prescription for a certain liquid medicine... I took it and it worked great and didn't burn anymore =]|`|2oBA15KYaa	go 2 doctors, if it burns then it ain't right. u might have a little infection, but it can be simplily treated with medcation.
RqU2LWnSaa	Bench- Inhale on way down exhale on way up is the safe textbook answer.  If you really want to move weight you breathe in on way down and hold your breath on way up.  Watch any competitive lifter on you tube.  Valsalva manoeuvre.|`|satoCRC6aa	exhale when you exert your energy.  Bench press... exhale when you push up the bar of weights.|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	okay so you like bench we will use that as an example...so your laying on the bench and your lifting the bar off the rack...you want to breath in as your bringing it down to your chest, and then breath out as your pushing the bar up....do that for every exercise and breathing is a very important part of working out...a lot of people just hold their breath while they lift...you have to breath..|`|Q6YL8LNRaa	exhale when youre lifting, and inhale when you dont have the added weight.  Exhaling while youre supporting,pulling the weight will tighten the muscles, giving you the best possible workout you want.
WadzK6ejaa	Put local antiseptic such as 10% povidone iodine twice a day and take antibiotics preferably by doctor
28U2vr1paa	It's not necessarily serious, but you should report to your doctor as soon as possible to find the underlying cause.|`|zwsdYR3Vaa	Go to the Emergency Room immediately! Yes it's serious!|`|AA11747665	Ask Doc Holliday. It killed him..TB|`|aMQD2UnWaa	sounds like a serious infection. Call the doctor.|`|LAanaXmraa	thats baaad.  are you coughing up phlegm with red blood?  or are you coughing and actual blood is coming out?    you should go see your doctor as soon as possible.
bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Geez, you know why it's so hard to find out where you got mono?  Because you are contagious 7 weeks before you come down with any of the symptoms.  I think this is all you need to determine the answer to your question.      I'll also know that a lot of people just don't get it no matter if they're exposed or not.  Sometimes it's due to the fact that they had it as children.  Children get less symptoms than teens and the children are just thought to have a cold.  But the good thing is, once you have it, you will never have it again.  You can only get mono once...no matter what anyone says.    Ok, I'll try to answer your original question, If he drank from the glass of the kid with mono, then immediately drank from his glass then gave you a sip or drink, then maybe it would be possible.  Slim chance though.    .|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	It's possible if your friend who shared the drink with the mono kid has mono now. I got it from sharing lip gloss. If you start to feel sick or are tired all the time, go see the doctor so he can confirm, but if your friend doesn't have mono, you probably won't either.
ewDKMeJkaa	maybe u have ligament damage    did ur knee feel like buckling to the ground ? thats wot happened to me and it was ligament damage    get it checked out by a doc|`|z4slPzgSaa	Probably a ligament injury, but without the help of an x-ray or an examination it's impossible to tell over the computer. You've left it way too long now, why on earth have you not seeked medical help before? The injury is too old for you to go to A&E, make an appointment with your GP for a physio appointment.|`|rPkqsVFLaa	i did the same but i had a dog draggin me............. ice n heat off n on n it'll heal quicker if u r in unbearable pain then c your doctor
hivTXSQLaa	You are fine this is normal. No two women are a like your level of hormones that your body has is just low you can regulate it if you go on birth control or it should just come naturally. If you are worried talk to your mom or someone in your family that you trust. You can always go to planed parenthood if you are freakish about talking to your mom.|`|PKUtKIRfaa	no..it happens..nothing to worry about|`|PEvWgIkVaa	You should go ask your docter.  Usually girls get them every month,    But my health teacher said sometimes some girls get periods Months after their one before.  so..if you dont get it soon ask your docter|`|uAzBvk5gaa	talk to your doctor.  id be happy to have mine stop  lmao:P|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	Do you work out alot? Maybe thats why?|`|f9uBsiosaa	u could be pregnant|`|W70UXr42aa	OH MY GOD YOUR PREGNANT    better go get a smasmortion at the smasmortion clinic!|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	oh my god your PREGANT|`|IfuChHghaa	periods don't occur on a steady basis for about 1-2 years.  until then, they're fairly random and you may not get them for a few months.|`|sXeyRD9taa	I wouldn't actually "worry" about it, but next time you go to the doctors for a check up just let him/her know about it.|`|RyApVLzQaa	You most likely have irregular periods. (Which is normal)  Don't worry about it and if your nervous talk to your mother about it. :)|`|LpJ9TLNBaa	congratulations...|`|AA11388636	No, that's normal. Your body is just getting adjusted to it. Your periods will be irregular for a few years. So don't worry. But if it doesn't come around again within the next couple of months, go get yourself checked out by a doctor.|`|qabyIJAkaa	heyy firstly..NO its nothing to worrry about. I remember when i first started. I think i got it bout twice and then it stopped for bout 6months or maybe even more. Then after its insanely regular, so be thankful girlie honestly it will be back before you know it.  Also if you really are worried about it dont be embarrassed to tell someone bout it. chances are they know exactly what you mean and they can sort you out.  Good luck xxx|`|L0Hz227xaa	Same thing happened to be when i was young, then it ame back. I was 11 when i got mine then it came back at like 12 so dont worry, if ur not sexually active, theres nothing to worry about, promise you, it will come back. Your just young, its and adolecent thing.|`|WvQuyaf8aa	no your young its fine|`|WiHVllaaaa	When you are that young your cycles will still be quiet irregular.    Don't worry about it|`|Qh0ZSXUQaa	Yea this is something you sould go to the Doctor about. have you told your mom?|`|gnBPEdVUaa	Your life has become a run on sentance.|`|jBNdm5y1aa	TALK 2 UR DOC|`|a5f953be88e6808fa3af2ed7c0fd0aa2aa	I wouldn't worry about it too much as you are still very young however you should know what is going on with your body.  If you can't talk to your mother or father, talk to a school nurse or go see your doctor.|`|nwRC0WkLaa	If you haven't had unprotected sex then there's no way you can be pregnant.    Otherwise, it's just something that tends to happen when you first start having periods. Young girls first starting their periods tend to have irregular periods, sometimes skipping them or having them at odd times lasting long or short. you will probably get your period back soon.    But, if you feel that something else may be wrong (which I doubt it is because irregular periods are normal when just starting) you can ask your doctor.|`|2bfdxef1aa	u might be off track.... i am 12 too!! dont worry about it !!!! your period comes on and off|`|mv3HD9rGaa	It could be that you first was a false alarm, that happened to me to, I had my first one when I was 13 and didn't have another until I was 15 and they've been regular ever since. I went to the doctor when it didn't happen again and they said that it wasn't uncommon but if you are worried get it checked out.    If you were having them regularly and they suddenly stopped it could have been due to stress or pregnacy but from what you said I highly doubt either of them.   Hope that its nothing serious.|`|9d3XJecAaa	Malnutrition? it means not eating the right stuff.. If you have an eating disorder, that is probablly it|`|AzFScZ3Kaa	Irregular periods you will be fine...|`|Tt5Wi49uaa	Call your doctor, relax. I bet it's just refreshing because of so much blood, I really don't know about periods so much i'm 14 and mine started 6 months.

V7mp8RCdaa	try not to think about it... wear tight boxers or lift it up and tuck it where the elastic of your shorts are and tie it there...|`|cr2KKT6Naa	wear tighter underware. or a jockstrap. or what you need to do is say your going to go in to take a poop but just spank the monkey for a while releive the pressure. your going to be fine.and it gives the other kids something to laugh at and talk about. your not that special. by any chance are you retarded. cause the brain works different in retards.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	When you are young you will get erections all the time, it should not be embarassing, it is normal. But if you are concerned wear reasonable tight briefs to hold it in.  If it is big you should be proud of the outline!|`|CYhN1jRMaa	Wear your gym pants lower so that your pants waistline is right on top of your penis.  It should be tuck in under the waistline so your penis is pointing straight up.  This way when you get an erection it will point up instead of out and no one will notice.  Erections aren't always a bad thing though.  In drama for some reason the girl I like had sit in my lap I got a b oner.  I'm goin out with her now but I quit drama.  I hate that class.  You could also tape it up but it might rip out some pube when you take it off.  But whatever you do, don't chop it off.|`|JQznZUXdaa	Testosterone is what controls how big it is. For examlpe doctors treat boys with micropenia with testosterone shots or cream to make it grow.  The genetics you got from your father is what controls your testosterone level or size. You will grow for a few more years!|`|hpLvv1cGaa	You posted this 10minutes ago, we know your attention craving.|`|fE3Uqdv8aa	Then stay out of the showers!|`|0TuDRZ61aa	well wear underwear|`|NsRdkOIvaa	jack off before gym so u less horney in gym|`|8f76a641fcc12854ac14c658fafcfc25aa	Considering i answered your similar question earlier there's only one thingleft to do in your case. Sit on the weight press machine backwards, lift as heavy as possible in a military press above your head, let go an dyou'll never have this problem again.....EVER I promise.|`|1SuOVM4Saa	jerk off when ur going to skool  or just dont think of sexthings|`|s7nvrn9faa	Well, my boobs are too big so I can't sleep on my stomach.|`|4pwMpbMIaa	Saw it off!|`|cjmtIOwlaa	Wear a hat and people wont see it :)|`|xt677EEwaa	Tape it to your stomach|`|GI27dKIkaa	Soon as it happens - go to the showers and 'crack one off' - it'll soon go down again !|`|66fMJo6raa	go to the nurse|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Unless you wear no top, discretely adjust it so that no one notices you doing it, and adjust it...direct it up under the waste band of your shorts toward your belly button.    It's safe there and not noticed. When it goes to sleep, it will fall back to it's resting spot. It needs to do this so that through your growth stage in life when it's growing, it gets fill out as needed to be, and grows to it's straight non-bent healthy maximum.    Don't be mad at your gear, be mad at human quirks which makes it tough for humans to handle natural development. I don't mean that people should see you nude, but spontaneous erections in your clothing are part of male growth and development and should just be ignored as something really normal, healthy, and expected ...instead of connecting shame and embarrassment to it.     Hope that helps you and helps you feel better toward your amazing gear.    Me! :- )|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Wear tight pants|`|cnk6hHQjaa	one word : amputation|`|WT5jdIkxaa	depends on what you think of as big mate, but either way can see your problem, during exercise you release more testosterone, so sex levels are higher, try going at a less busy time, wear tighter underwear, exercise at home|`|nZdq2GmTaa	flip your penis up towards your stomach and then put the elastic band thats on your gym shorts around it to keep it facing up when its hard. that way instead of sticking out, it sticks up. as long as you dont lift up your shirt, you'll be fine

uqgsruFXaa	That  is such a bland question. <br>  Are you getting fatter or just weighing more? How are you measuring your body fat? <br>  Your body isn't going to go into "starvation mode" unless you are seriously depriving your body of nutrients.<br>  People need to stop answering if they have no idea what they are talking about. One person had it right. There is no way to be sure and it could be a sign that you have a more serious problem. You could have a thyroid problem or some other illness.|`|HPn75mp8aa	You've probably eaten too little for a long time and your body has gone into starvation mode. This means your metabolism has slowed down, you make do with less calories, your muscles are being consumed by your body for energy and any excess calories you eat are being turned directly into fat.|`|4XQzATWbaa	This could be due to your body getting used to having fewer calories and your metabolism slowing down - this is why those silly "500cals a day" extreme diets don't work for people (I'm not accusing you of being on one you understand).<br>  <br>  Have you any other symptoms - are you feeling incredibly tired, muscle aches, an "I can't be bothered" feeling, weepy, loss of hair, dry skin, spotty skin?  The reason I ask is that I was eating less as I had no major appetite but was gaining weight like no tomorrow - transpires I had PCOS.<br>  <br>  If the weight gain is a lot, go to your doctor and request a blood test.  Most doctors tend to ignore the "I've gained weight but am eating less" - it took 9 months before my doctor would believe me and send me for a full-works blood test - so start writing down what you eat and what you weight.  Keep a record for a week / fortnight and then visit your doctor armed with the information.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you get things sorted.|`|0hhj0aCvaa	By not eating properly, your body has gone into defense mode, It's trying to store all the fat it can, which leads to not losing wait.  Our bodies are smarter than one might think.  You need to start exercising , and pay a little bit more attention on what your eating, Cutting back from eating a full pizza to a half isn't going to cut the cake. It's eating pizza in general is what the problem is.|`|Jteqao3zaa	less is not always better, you could eat 10 bean burgers a day, and it would still be less fattening than two steaks, what are you eating?  also, if you have been working out it could very well be muscle weight, ignore the scale, have you lost any inches?|`|jrj9Gcvbaa	it's really important that you consume all the calories that you would be allowed to have and maintain a healthy weight.  other person is right. eventually your body goes into starvation mode and will consume it stores.  strongly suggest you get together with your dr or joing weight watchers(or something similar) to help you find a diet plan that works for you. good luck.|`|s7pXnC5Naa	He is exactly right - your body doesn't understand that you want to lose weight, so since there is less food coming thru, it assumes that there is less available - so to conserve, it has slowed your metabolism, and stores all it can as fat.<br>  <br>  so how do you reverse it?<br>  it is possible, but it may take a few weeks for your body to change it's present pattern of hording your intake.  <br>  <br>  Look at your present diet - what are you leaving out - there is some food/vitamin essential for your body which you have been depriving it of.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try this: 1) drink enough water, ~ 1 liter a day is sufficient if you aren't exercising a lot, exercise increases your body's need of water since u lose it thru sweat<br>  <br>  2) stop all soft drink, sports bar and mixed drinks - many of these are so overly processed with alternative sugars and such that are deceptively fattening<br>  <br>  3) start eating fresh veggies - green beans, turnips, spinach, etc ...all have many essential vitamins, and nutrients... but<br>  <br>  4) start taking supplements, a good multivitamin is a good place to start - consider nutritional powdered drinks from a good health food store <br>  <br>  5) if you eat meat, stick to the white meats primarily for a bit - avoid fried foods, of course - integrate the red meats slowly<br>  if you don't eat meats, you still require protein intake... eggs, lean milk products may be an alternative for you - <br>  <br>  6) increase your fiber intake - these still contain calories, but it will make you feel less hungry and most important will keep you regular - oatmeal with a tablespoon of flaxseeds added is a popular and excellent choice<br>  <br>  if your body is deprived of an essential nutrition to function effectively, it will slow the metabolism because it thinks that it is starving

VmyQPltnaa	There is always some pain at the dentist but nowadays with the liberal use of lidocaine it is minimal.  Tell him up front that you are a dental coward.  That's what I do.  Then whatever discomfort there is you deal with it.  Think of the potential alternative--a lifetime of gumming your food, not being able to eat apples or corn on the cob.  Bummer.|`|7x6ROXD2aa	I had one of those a few months back - my reward for not going for years.  It wasn't too bad, and I used to be scared of the dentist, too.  I developed so many teeth problems, though, that I'm literally going every month now to get everything fixed.  Now, it's a breeze!  A deep clean just feels like a more intense cleaning where they really get in between the teeth and around the gumline.  Just keep your eyes shut and think of your favorite song or movie! :)  Good luck!|`|XbfHUf5faa	Lool why would u wanna give me ur num u dont even no if im a girl

AA10081135	Use online calorie calculators to figure it out (As with any internet search, always use more than one source):<br>  <a href="http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marathonguide.com/FitnessCalcs/Caloricneeds.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marathonguide.com/FitnessCalc...</a><br>  <br>  These calculators will tell you how many to eat in a day for your body size, and how many to eat to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Basically, there are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. So if you cut 500 calories a day from your current eating habits, you'll lose a pound of fat in a week. If you want to lose weight, aim for losing 1-2 pounds a week through diet and exercise -- any more than that and your metabolism will fight back by slowing down to prevent too much weight loss (your body will think you ran out of food, so it will slow your metabolism down to delay starvation).|`|Ia7nddGhaa	you need to look at more than just calories.<br>  you need to look at sodium, fats, etc.<br>  you count calories by looking on the back of a package<br>  and calculating how much you've eaten|`|765b08c9616961f5568dcd5174c1087baa	avoid calories from fat (not always possible to do) and modified ingredients and high frictose corn syrup and don't worry about the amount you eat|`|AA12260137	It helped me a TON to count calories.

CuVnpxh3aa	There are a couple of things that come to mind. When I had uncontrolled high blood pressure my face would feel hot and my head would feel dizzy when I moved it. I went to the Dr. and my BP was 160/120 and the Dr. put me on BP pills and took me off all the salt. Another problem that can cause those symptoms is an inner ear infection or a sinus infection. You don't always get a headache with a sinus infection, your face just feels wierd/dizzy when you move it. Try some sinus pills to relieve the pressure (which causes the dizzy feelings when you move your head) I usually use walmart Equate brand but you can use any kind you want, just make sure they are for relieving sinus pressure. It will take a couple of days taking them regularly before it gets better but if the sinus pressure is the problem you should notice a difference after 1 or 2 doses of the pills. I doubt very much that it is migranes, you feel sick with them and can't stand to be in the light and it usually only hurts on one side of your head, big time headache. My daughter has those and it is almost debilitating (she couldn't go to work with them) and her face never felt hot. I think what you mean by your face feeling hot inside is it feels flushed like there is a fire inside your skin. I had that with the high blood pressure. I would suggest you get your BP checked also. I hope this helps.|`|8c9c7f3d489487ceb31579734c8a5e4eaa	It sounds like to me like you may have a ear infection or a cold. If it keeps up you might want to go to the doctor and have them check your blood . I had that feeling before and my blood pressure was low . I went to the doctor and they check me out and sure enough I did have an ear infection. I hope you get to feel better and be careful not to fall if your feel dizzy especially. good lucke|`|2ajNekSQaa	go 2 a doctor or a clinic|`|8c5b28ce2ea1332856878b6ef54823e0aa	do you had a headache too cuz when i have migrains it hurts more when i bend down or turn too fast.... just a thought or u might just have a bug...|`|GhIrOBYeaa	I felt like that not too long ago, I think I might have been irritated by something bcuz it went away w/out drugs..

CuVnpxh3aa	This has been happening for 2 years and you are just now trying to find out what it is? You need to see a Dr. Anything you would get on here would just be a guess and you need more than guesses. Make an appointment ASAP and find out what is wrong. This is not normal.

Have you been to see a doctor yet? They may send you to a neurologist. They will take a complete history and might schedule you for an EEG. This is painless but you will need a shampoo afterwards. That can help determine what you have for sure. Seizures can be caused by several things. Epilepsy is the most common but other abnormalities are also possible.<br>  Best of luck.|`|AA11484395	You need to have your sugar tested by more than someone's <br>  "checker".

Diabetes can be tricky...get to your doctor and find out what is causing the problem.
